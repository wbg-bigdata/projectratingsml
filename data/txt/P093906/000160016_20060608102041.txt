A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country andSector Issues

The Government of China is committed to developing an efficient multimodal transport system
to enhance competitiveness and promote development.          At the core o f their program is the
National Trunk Highway System (NTHS), comprised o f 12 major expressway corridors (five
vertical and seven horizontal) connecting all provincial capitals and main cities. The initial
NTHS backbone has made great progress toward providing the core network connectivity. The
development i s now shifting toward linking poorer western regions with eastern China, the
engine o f China's economic growth.

Jiangxi i s a landlockedprovince insouth central China with a population o f over 40 million. It i s
one o f the lagging regions in China by every standard: (a) 32 counties out o f a total o f 99
counties and cities in Jiangxi province are identified as poor; and (b) 21 o f which are classified
as national-level poverty counties.

Ganzhou City Prefecture i s the largest prefecture and accounts for 24 percent (39,600 km2)o f
Jiangxi province. Located in the south o f Jiangxi, it i s a highly mountainous area. Most poor
counties o f the province are located in Ganzhou City Prefecture. With a population o f 8.3
million, the prefecture has agricultural, mineral and manufacturing industries.        The citrus
industry, already exporting over 350,000 tons annually, is undergoing rapid expansion. There is
significant potential for growth inthe miningindustries due to the highlevels o f nonferrous and
rare earth metals inthe area.

The Need for Improved High-Grade Access to K e y Facilities. Lack o f transport accessibility
is one o f the constraints to the social and economic development o f these southern landlocked
mountainous areas. The Ruijin-Ganzhou Expressway (RGE) i s planned to link Ganzhou and the
area east to an expressway currently under construction in Fujian province. This will provide a
high-quality transport link to the coastal port and international airport at Xiamen (Fujian
province). Inthe future, the expressway network will continue to develop westward, eventually
connecting with Chengdu (Sichuan province) and Kunming(Yunnan province).

T h e Need for Improved Local Road Access to Markets and Services. Local roads, Class IV
andunclassified roads, account for about 75 percent o f the total mileage (61,860 km) o f the road
network in the province; and more than half o f these roads are unpaved.            Ganzhou City
Prefecture is poorly served by local roads.       Out o f the total mileage o f 11,544 km, over
77 percent o f roads are Class IV or unclassified, some 2 percent lower than the average technical
standard inthe province.

The Need for Improved Sector Management. The previous two Bank highway projects have
helped the Jiangxi Provincial Communications Department (JPCD) improve their operations in a
number o f key areas, such as safety and road maintenance; however, more needs to be done.
There i s a need to further improve planning and safety processes at the JPCD. There i s also a
need to start the deliveryo f anti-HIV/AIDS education inthe sector.




                                                  1

2. Rationalefor BankInvolvement

The east-west linkages o f the NTHS are critical for the development o f China's lagging regions
and to attain the full benefit o f the NTHS network connectivity. The RGE will be a key
contributor to the development of the NTHS and will stimulate trade-led growth in a landlocked
poor province o f China. It will further strengthenregional integration andthe competitiveness o f
Jiangxi province and its neighbors.

The local roads improvement program (LRIP) will address the needs o f the poor and
disadvantaged people within Ganzhou City Prefecture.

The project will build on the institutional strengthening activities from the Bank's previous two
projects to assist the JPCD to manage the road network effectively. The project will address key
areas, including safety, maintenance and operations.

Two additional institutional strengthening activities will be undertaken as separate projects in
conjunction with the JHP3 project. An HIVIAIDS education program (financed through an IDF
grant) will educate construction workers and local residents on HIV/AIDS, as well as
strengthening the JPCD's ability to execute efficient HIV/AIDS education programs on its
projects. In conjunction with Shaanxi province, a study will be done to investigate the viability
o f using micro-enterprises to maintain local roads, applying techniques used in Latin America
and elsewhere. A request for hnding of this activity has been made to the Public-Private
InfrastructureAdvisory Facility (PPIAF).

3. Higher-LevelObjectivesto Whichthe ProjectContributes

The project contributes to Pillar 2 o f the 2006 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) `Reducing
Poverty, Inequality, Social Exclusion'. The enhanced highway sector management and lower
transportation costs will expand the economic opportunities for the rural poor.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. LendingInstrument

The Bank will finance the project through a specific investment loan. The Borrower has selected
the variable-spread loan (VSL) option in which the spread over LIBOR is reset every semester.
The Borrower's main reason for selecting a VSL rather than a fixed-spread loan (FSL) i s because
FSL charges are slightly higher than VSL charges and the Borrower does not foresee usingthe
conversion options of the FSL. VSL repayment terms are governed by standard country terms.

2. ProjectDevelopmentObjective and Key Indicators

The project development objective i s to improve east-west passenger and freight flows inJiangxi
province by investing in the construction o f an expressway, enhancing local roads, and
strengthening highwaymanagement.

The objectives will bemeasured using the following outcome indicators:




                                                 2

0  inthe Ruijin-Ganzhou corridor: (a) increased average daily traffic; (b) decreasedaccidents on
   the existing road G323; and (c) decreasedtravel time from Ruijinto Ganzhou;
0  for the road sections o f the Local Roads Improvement Program: (a) increased average daily
   traffic; (b) reduced number o f days closed; (c) reduced travel times; (d) increased bus
   services; and
0  implementation o f key recommendations from the institutional strengthening components
   with regard to tunnel safety, roadside safety, and electronic toll collection.

3. ProjectComponents

COMPONENT       A: RUIJIN-GANZHOU     EXPRESSWAY(RGE)
The RGEwill be a 117 km long section (about US$627 million, or 88 percent o f the total project
cost) o f the Xiamen-Chengdu expressway, which belongs to one o f the east-west corridors o f the
NTHS. With the main north-south corridors now complete, the focus is shifting to providing
east-west linkages, thereby completing network connectivity. It will connect Ganzhou City in
the west with the Guangdong - Beijing expressway. In the east it will terminate just west o f
RuijinCity. The project will link with a 31 km expressway section between the RGE and the
Fujianprovincial border, which will bebuiltusingabuild-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme with a
concession contract signed for a 22-year period. This B O T i s considered linked to the RGE
project so the Bank's safeguard policies will apply. With the completion o f the expressway, and
the link between the Fujian border and Xiamen (under construction), Ganzhou City will have
direct high-quality access to the port o fXiamen.

The area crossed by the RGE i s a succession o f three basins separated by mountains: the
Ganzhou, Yudu and Ruijin basins.          Between these basins the mountains are high, some
exceeding 1,000 meters (m) o f altitude. The main river between Huichang and Ganzhou i s the
Gong. In Ganzhou City, the Gong River becomes the Gan River. The Gong River links the
Ganzhou basin with the Yudu basin via a narrow valley. The terrain i s very challenging and
required careful route selection and designs so as to minimize the environmental and social
impacts while providing adequate access to local communities.

COMPONENT LOCAL B:        ROADS   IMPROVEMENT     PROGRAM
The Local Roads Improvement Program (LRIP) o f approximately US$74 million aims to
improve access inpoor areas o f the province. The amount o f the Bank financing shall be US$lO
million.

The LRIP will be implemented in two phases. Phase Io f the program includes upgrading two
existing roads: Chuengyi -Fengzhou (Chonfeng) road (48.5 km) and Meicun-Longbu (Meilong)
road (34.8 km). The additional road sections for Phase I1 will be identified using the same
selection criteria as in Phase I.Ganzhou City Prefecture i s the priority area for the LRIP, and i s
where the expressway component will be built. Currently its road network density i s about
0.23 km/km2, about 38percent lower than the average road density (0.37 km/km2) in the
province. Among the total mileage o f 11,544 km inGanzhou City Prefecture, 8,901 km o f roads
are Class IV or unclassified, some 2percent lower than the average technical standard in the
province. As one o f the poorest prefectures with lowest densities o f road network in the
province, the LRIP component will support high-priority needs o f local access.



                                                 3

COMPONENTC:INSTITUTIONAL           STRENGTHENING
The institutional strengthening component o f about US$lO million reflects the current needs of
the JPCD inkey areas. The component includes:

0   Traffic Safety Operations for Tunnels. A provincial tunnel safety management plan will
    be established to ensure that there are adequate resources and procedures to handle tunnel
    emergencies.
0   Traffic Safety Improvement for Expressways. This activity will improve traffic safety
    conditions on expressways by establishing appropriate roadside facility policies.
0   Implementation of Electronic Toll Collection (ETC).          An ETC implementation strategy
    for Jiangxi province will be established based on the national ETC plan. This will especially
    focus on the institutional and operational issues associated with ETC implementation.
0   Training. Domestic and foreign training activities will cover a range o f topics including
    design, safety, maintenance, management, finance and the environment.
0   Equipment. Equipment will be procured for expressway management and maintenance, and
    environmental monitoring. These will include weighing stations, quality control sets and
    road condition monitoring equipment.

The institution will also be strengthened through the HIV/AIDS education and the micro-
enterprises for roadmaintenance projects, which will be financed through grants.

4. Lessons Learned and Reflectedinthe Project Design

The extensive experience that the Bank has developed based on the numerous highway projects
inChina and the corresponding lessons learnedwere incorporatedinthe project design. Among
them are:

0   The developmentplans of large urban centers should be incorporated early in the project
    design of national and provincial transportation links. The development plans of Ganzhou
    and Ruijin cities were incorporated early inthe project design to ensure good linkages to the
    expressway. The location of the alignment and some interchanges were adjusted to better
    reflect local development plans. The project i s consistent with the provincial and national
    transportation plans.

0   Thepreparatory activities greatly contribute to theproject's success. Substantial preparatory
    work, including land acquisition, resettlement, environmental impact and design studies
    performed duringproject preparationhave contributed to the readiness o fthe project.

0   Ensure client ownership of        institutional components.       The proposed institutional
    strengthening component builds on the achievements from the previous two Bank-financed
    highway projects in Jiangxi Province and the lessons learned in the implementation o f
    institutional components o f other highwayprojects inChina.

5. Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection

Linkage with Fujian Province. There is a 31 km expressway section linking Ruijin with the
Fujian border that was not included as part o f the project. This was excluded by the JPCD since



                                                  4

they wanted it completed urgently so as to take advantage o f the new link with FujianProvince
to supply traffic to Jiangxi's existing expressways. In September 2005, the JPCD signed a 22-
year concession contract with a Hong Kong-based company to build this section using a BOT
scheme. The same safeguard policies will be applied to this road section since it i s considered
linkedto the RGE.

Scope of the LRIP. An alternative to expand the scope o f the LRIP to allow any local road in
the province to be eligible was considered. However, it was decided to focus only on road
sections located in the Ganzhou City Prefecture.       This decision was taken to enhance the
potential impact o f the expressway component, which i s located entirely in the Ganzhou City
Prefecture, and to prioritize its impact on the poorest southern area o f the province. It was
originally planned to include only periodic road maintenance and improvement or rehabilitation
inthe LRIP. However, the construction of new local road sections will be considered, ifthese
are properlyjustified.

RGE Alignment Alternatives. The original feasibility study o f the RGE considered a southern
and a northern alignment. After further work a combination o f both alternatives, with some
refinements,  was selected. The final alignment minimizes the resettlement requirements and
limits the negative environmental impacts, while reflecting local development plans. It will
provide the best overall benefits to the people livinginthe project area.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. PartnershipArrangements

None.

2. InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements

The Borrower i s the People's Republic o f China (PRC), which will onlend the loan proceeds
through the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to Jiangxi Province on the same conditions as the Bank
loan to PRC. The overall direction of the project at the central level will rest with the Ministryo f
Communications (MOC) located inBeijing.

At the provincial levelthe Jiangxi Provincial Communications Department (JPCD) i s responsible
for the overall project implementation in close coordination with the Jiangxi Provincial Finance
Department (JPFD) and with support from the National Development and Reform Commission
(NDRC), MOF, M O C andthe Jiangxi Provincial Planning Commission (JPPC).

The World Bank LoanProject Management Office (PMO), which is part o f the JPCD, will act as
the executing agency. It will carry out the procurement and financial oversight for the project,

established inGanzhou City Prefecturefor the LRIP component - to fulfill their obligations.
and will provide support to other project implementation units - such as the LRIP-PMO to be


After the RGE construction is completed, it will be operated and maintained by a division under
the Jiangxi Provincial High-class Highway Administration Bureau (JPHHAB), which i s a
specialized agency under the JPCD. JPHHAB has limited administrative, management and
legislative authority, and is strictly controlled by the JPCD. Under JPHHAB, there are four


                                                  5

expressway management divisions, each in charge o f one expressway. The RGE i s one o f these
four divisions. JPHHAB and its divisions are responsible for expressway management,
maintenance and toll collection. In addition, JPHHAB i s also responsible for the administration
o f all expressways in Jiangxi except for three expressways managed by the Jiangxi Highway
Bureau and Ganzhou City. Particular duties of expressway administration include: maintenance
planning, road condition inspection, disputes management and compensation.                    Construction
supervision o f the RGE will be carried out by a domestic supervision team, assisted by foreign
specialists on an as-needed basis.

3. Monitoring and Evaluation of Outcomes/Results

Annex 3 contains the performance indicators adopted for the project. The PMO will monitor and
evaluate the data that will be collected by the various project implementation units and will
prepare and submit to the Bank semiannual reports using guidelines and standards previously
agreed with the Bank. The baseline data and target values were agreed and will be included as
part o f the monitoring reports. The Ganzhou City Prefecturewill monitor and evaluate the LRIP
component. Annual independent audits o f the special accounts will be carried out, and an
implementation completion report (ICR) will be prepared within six months o f the closing date
o f the Bank loan.

4. Sustainability

The sustainability o f the project i s defined by: (a) the current central government's policy to
improve accessibility to the western and central provinces; (b) the provincial government's
commitment to establish a transport corridor with access to an international seaport; and (c) the
constantly growing traffic in the corridor, sustained economic growth o f the province and rapid
development o f the cities o f Ganzhou and Ruijin. All o f the above are enhanced by the matured
andwell-established relationship between the Bank and Jiangxi province through two successful
lending operations.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. EconomicandFinancialAnalyses

Economic (Cost benefit)
EIRR= 14.6, NPV (12%) =US$189.0 million

 This economic evaluation covers the two project components that account for 98% of the
 project's costs: (a) construction o f the 117 km RGE expressway, and (b) the upgrading o f two
 rural roads (83 km) for the first-phase construction under the LRIP. The principal measured
 benefits o f the project are savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC), travel time savings to
 vehicle occupants, and enhanced road safety. The estimated overall economic internal rate o f
 return (EIRR) for the project i s 14.6 percent, with those for the RGE and LRIP being 14.2 and
 22.6 percent, respectively.     The overall economic net present value (NPV), based on a
 12percent discount rate, i s estimated at US$189.0 million, o f which the RGE i s estimated to
 contribute US$152.5 million and the LRIP US$36.5 million.           The evaluation results and a
 description o f the methodused to derive them are provided in Annex 9 and are summarized as

The construction of the RGE i s the main component o f the project (the total cost o f the RGE
constitutes about 88 percent o f the total project cost). The JPCD i s planning to use the toll
revenue from the RGE to cover the amortization charges o f the Bank and domestic loans.
Although the highway will generate enough total revenue over the loan period to finance
operations, maintenance and debt service, with a standard amortization schedule there will be a
low profit margin in the early years o f operation. A conservative traffic projection combined
with high construction costs resulting from the mountainous terrain affects the financial rate o f
return o f the investment, which i s expected to be about 0.8 percent. However, based on the
proposed toll rate, the RGE may not need any external cash injection over the life o f the project
due to the large sum of depreciation reserves and the flexible principal payment terms on the
domestic loan. Unlike the RGE, which i s tolled, the LRIP roads will have no revenue. The
financial evaluation has confirmed the availability o f sufficient counterpart finds and the
capacity o f the JPCD to finance operating expenses of the LRIP. All the indicators show that the
financial risks are modest. A detailed assessment i s provided inAnnex 9.

2. Technical

The detailed project description is in Annex 4. The RGE design and traffic studies were
subjected to in-depth technical reviews by the Bank and independent consultants.             The
expressway standards adopted are justified by the traffic forecasts and the fact that the project
belongs to the NTHS system. Safety conditions in tunnels do not allow bidirectional two-lane
highways. Highways without expressway standards would have resulted in numerous access
points and the presence o f pedestrians, bicycles, animals and slow vehicles, which would not be
compatible with the project's objective o f enhancing long-distance traffic through safe and
efficient operations. The M O C expressway standards with a design speed o f 100 km/h were
adopted, taking into consideration the difficult mountainous terrain o f the project area. The
following issues needed special attention from a technical point o f view:

0   proper consideration o f traffic safety and tunnel hazards throughout the design process,
    especially giventhe long steep slopes and numerous tunnels;

0   including provision for non-motorized traffic on river bridgeswhere no alternative route was
    available;

0   sufficient geological investigations on technically challenging locations to minimize the risk
    of encountering major problems at the construction stage, given the mountainous terrain; and




                                                 9

0  fully operational electrical and mechanical (E&M) works at the opening of the highway to
   traffic, especially those dealing with tunnel safety.

The Communications Design Institute of Jiangxi Province's (CDIJP) designs were initially
reviewed by the M O C Design Institute No. 2 in Wuhan. The structure and pavement designs
were further reviewed by an international consulting firm financed by a Spanish Trust Fund
grant. The alignment was reviewed by the Bank appraisal team. The traffic analysis was
reviewed by an international consultant.

Cost estimates reflect November 2005 prices and are based on the preliminary design. The
prevailing unit rates for civil works were checked against effective rates in similar works under
Bank-financed projects in Jiangxi and other provinces in China, recent costs o f foreign experts
from highwayprojects and recent price quotations for equipment.

3. Fiduciary

Financial Management.         The adequacy o f the project financial management system was
assessedbased on guidelines issued by the Financial Management Sector Board on November 3,
2005 (see Annex 7). The assessment concluded that the project meets minimum Bank financial
management requirements, as stipulated in BP/OP 10.02. It was confirmed that the project
would have in place an adequate project financial management system that can provide, with
reasonable assurance, accurate andtimely information on the status o f the project inthe reporting
format agreed with the Bank.

Procurement. A procurement capacity assessment o f the implementing agencies was carried
out during preappraisal (see Annex 8).     The assessment concluded that the overall risk o f the
procurement process i s average. The JPCD and the dependent entities involved in the project
have allocated adequate resources, including experienced staff, to implement the project. These
agencies (except the PMO for the LRIP component) are familiar with Bank procurement
procedures and appear adequate for procurement implementation. An action plan to strengthen
the procurement capacity o f the implementing agencies was discussed with the JPCD and agreed
upon. The plan calls for the preparation and dissemination o f a project-specific procurement
manual, training workshops, along with measures to avoid excessive cost overruns and improve
procurement economy and efficiency. The ways in which the Tendering and Bidding Law o f
China differs from the Bank guidelines were addressed in the assessment, and clarifications for
the procedures to be followed for Bank-financed national competitive bidding (NCB)
procurement were included inthe loan agreement.

4. Social

The RGE and the two road sections under Phase Io f the LRIP will affect 86 villages, largely
through land acquisition and house demolition.          The project will require acquisition o f
15,619 mu o f land, out o f which 5,333 mu or 34 percent are farmland. A total o f 310,463 m2o f
houses will be demolished, affecting 1,718 households.

A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was prepared by the JPCD with support fiom professors o f
Wuhan University. This RAP covers the RGE and LRIP components, as well as the B O T



                                                 10

section (as an annex). The socioeconomic and inventory surveys were conducted in May 2005.
Supplementary surveys were done in July and November 2005 to accommodate the changes to
the project alignment. The compensation rates were determined through consultation with the
affected people and with a principle o f "not lower than the rates applied for Jiangxi Highway I1
and other local projects."     Emphasis was given to the rehabilitation strategy, including
construction o f the new residential area inthe same village for relocation o f 28-48 households.

A Social Impact Assessment (SIA) for both the expressway and the LRIP Phase Iroads was
undertaken by Zhongshan University. The SIA focused on improving the project design by
identifying the social impacts of the project on the communities in the project area, and
consultation with the various stakeholders for improvement of the project design.         The SIA
confirmed that the project would improve the transportation conditions and the local economy.
It also identified the main concerns o f the villagers with regard to land acquisition, relocation,
road construction and road safety. The SIA was sent to the design institute (CDIJP), PMO and
Project Resettlement Office (PRO) so that the comments and suggestions on resettlement issues
would be well considered duringthe process o f RAP preparation.

The resettlement management agencies were established with sufficient and capable staffing at
all administrative levels. Internal and external monitoring systems were established. Wide-
                                                                                '
ranging consultations were undertaken, with an estimated 80 percent o f the affected people
having participated. The RAP was disclosed locally and the local government confirmed its
agreement and commitment to implement the RAP in accordance with its terms. Comments
fi-om the SIA addressed in the RAP included: (a) most o f the affected villagers prefer to receive
land compensation incash; (b) some affected farmers were worried about receiving insufficient
payments and the potential for misuse o f the land compensation; and (c) the affected farmers
wanted to open an appropriate channel for grievances and feedback.

The LRIP Phase Iroads were included inthe Project RAP. An RPF was prepared for the LRIP
component. This will be used for the roads to be included inPhase I1o f the LRIP program. For
the Phase I1 roads, a census survey o f displaced persons and valuation o f assets will be
undertaken for an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan; or a socioeconomic studies and baseline
census will be undertaken for a Resettlement Plan. The approach to be used will be finalized
once the Phase I1roads are identified.

A screening for ethnic minorities was undertaken as part of the SIA process. The analysis
showed that the She and Yao people living in community inthe project area o f Ganzhou are not
indigenous and that the Bank policy therefore does not apply.

5. Environment

The RGE consists o f a 117 km expressway on a new alignment, and construction o f
approximately six km o f at-grade interconnecting roads on new alignments. The environmental
impacts include occupation o f fertile agriculture land and barren land; increases in dust, noise
and motor vehicle emissions; soil erosion, borrow area excavation, disposal of excess waste
material; community severance; resettlement; and safety during construction.




                                                 11

A large part of the effort duringthe early preparationo f the RGEdesignwas directedtoward the
selection of an environmentally and socially benign alignment, which was also technically,
politically and economically acceptable. The selection o f the alignment was carried out as
follows:

    During the September 2004 feasibility stage, two broad corridors were identified by the
    design institute and compared. The North Line alignment usedthe same corridor as the one
    used by NR 323 and the Ganlong Railway. The South Line scheme was proposed based on
    fewer crossings o f the Gong River, NR 323 and the Ganlong Railway.             The selected
    alignment also met the local government requirements.

    In stage two, within the preferred North Line corridor, two segments of the alignment,
    namely, the Yudu and Jiangkou segments, were further refined. Following comparisons, the
    Yudu Scheme I1was selected based on the least land occupation and resettlement, and
    associated lower disturbance and impacts. The scheme also met with local government
    approval.   In the Jiangkou section, the alternative was selected that gave the least land
    occupation, least resettlement and least interference with the Ganlong Railway and NR 323.

    Duringthe Preliminary Design in September and October 2005, additional alignments were
    compared (steps 3 and 4), as the design evolved and more geotechnical, cost, environmental
    and resettlement information became available. After thorough analyses, alternatives were
    selected based on: (a) lower environmental impacts; (b) lower resettlement and land
    occupancy; and (c) tradeoffs between lower construction cost and environmental impact
    against lower resettlement.

    In cases where there were no viable alternatives because of the proximity o f the RGE to
    towns, mining easements or railway lines, full consideration was given to mitigate adverse
    environmental and resettlement impacts arising out o f the alignment. This i s the case in
    Section K31-K33.5 where the alignment passes through a flood-prone area.           Since the
    alignment could not be shifted and the construction o f the expressway embankment could
    have worsened the flood levels and the duration o f the floods, a viaduct was introduced in
    this section and its length was increased to minimize the increase in flood levels and to
    reduce the duration o fthe flood.

The final outcome o f the work on the alignment is one with acceptably low environmental and
social impacts, a shorter length than originally proposed, and one that avoids unstable
geotechnical areas, above ground karst, cultural relic sites andnature reserves.

To mitigate environmental concerns, a standalone EMP was developed. It includes applicable
environmental standards, mitigation measures, monitoring plans for the construction and
operational phases, environmental training, institutional buildingand strengthening plan. During
construction, the implementation o f the EMP will be supervised by the Environmental Office o f
MOC, the project Supervision Consultants retained by the Jiangxi PMO, and the contractor's
environmental staff. During the operation o f the RGE, JPHHAB will be responsible for the
monitoring and implementation o f any environmental measures.              In addition, the State
Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Ganzhou and Ruijin Environmental
Protection Bureaus (EPBs) will monitor the implementation o fthe EMP.


                                                  12

Three rounds o f public consultation were carried out during the preparation o f the EA: the first
round followed the preparation o f EA Terms o f Reference (TOR) inDecember 2004; the second
and third rounds during the preparation o f the draft EA reports in September and October 2005
respectively. A total o f 646 people and families were consulted. The major concerns and
feedback centered on adequate and timely compensation for land acquisition, resettlement and
relocation; timely rehabilitation and/or restoration o f damaged irrigation systems; construction
safety; dust and noise pollution; better access to the RGE; and a sufficient number o f
passageways to cross the RGE. The rural public was concerned about road blockages and access
to services during the project, safety, noise and dust. The EA reports were placed in 12 libraries
in the affected areas, and in all city libraries and resettlement offices. In addition, the major
findings  and the summary o f the EA reports were published in the local and provincial
newspapers.

To address the concerns raised by the project-affected people, the JPCD has responded by: (a)
setting up land acquisition and resettlement offices under the PMO to develop, supervise and
implement the RAP and restoration o f the affected irrigation systems; (b) ensuring that an
adequate number o f passageways and crossings for pedestrians and farm vehicles (one about
every 600m) were included in the design; (c) providing safety barriers at selected locations
along the rural roads to provide protection to students, residents and livestock; (d) ensuring that
there i s provision for installing noise barriers, noise insulation windows and tree planting to
minimize noise impact from the RGE and the interconnecting roads; and (e) ensuring that the
contractors reclaim and restore borrow areas, camp sites, waste dumps, asphalt plant sites, etc.

The EA/EMP for the BOT section were prepared in a consistent manner to the RGE, following
the Bank's policies. They will be implemented inthe same way as the RGE, and supervised by
the Bank.

The LRIP roads will mostly follow the existing road alignments, and involve strengthening,
minor widening and realignment of the existing low-grade roads to increase their transportation
capacity, minimize congestion, increase drivingvisibility and provide all-season access. The EA
investigations did not find any protected areas or cultural relics along the selected alignments or
with the LRIP roads.

The LRIP component i s located inthe remote hilly region o f Jiangxi and the construction of the
roads will likely be carried out by local contractors who may lack proper managerial and trained
staff, Supervision i s expected to be weak and the environmental management o f the rural road
construction may be poor. Therefore, the project provides for the local transport bureau and the
contractors to receive environmental management training by specialists from the JPCD and
local EPBs. The training will encompass environmental protection during construction, noise
and dust control, construction camp management, borrow pits and disposal sites reclamation,
construction safety and health, etc. Monitoring will be carried out by local EPBs.

China and Road Sector Development

Duringthe last decade there were many changes affecting the transport sector in China. Since
the early 1990s, the economy has moved from a centrally planned environment to one that i s
more commercialized and competitive; the degree o f openness has increased; patterns o f
transport demand have changed; passenger and freight traffic have grown rapidly, puttingheavy
demands on infkastructure; and the role o fthe private sector has substantially increased.

Inthe past, China underinvested inroads, but since the mid-1990s, with a rapid increase inthe
rate o f road construction, it has become one o f the fastest countries inbuildingits road network.
By the end o f 2004 the total road network extended roughly 1,870,661 km, with 34,288 km o f
expressways and about 600,584 km of Class Ithrough I11 highways (see below).               With its
complementary railway and waterway networks, China has developed one o f the most diverse
transportationnetworks inthe world.

Inthe late 1990s, governments at all levels embarked on major highway investment programs.
At the core was the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS), which is the backbone, and most
important element of, the national transportation network. The NTHS was originally to be a
35,OOOkm network composed o f 12 major highways. There are five north-south corridors:
Beijing-Fuzhou, Beijing-Zhuhai, Chongqing-Zhanjiang, Erlianhaote-Hekou, and Tongjiang-
Sanya; and seven east-west corridors: Dandong-Lhasa, Hengyang-Kunming, Lianyungang-
Huoerguosi, Qingdao-Yinchuan, Shanghai-Chengdu, Shanghai-Ruili, and Suifenhe-Manzhouli.
With an estimated cost of US$l50 billion, the NTHS will connect all provincial capitals and
cities with populations exceeding 500,000 inhabitants (100 major cities). By the end o f 2004,
roughly 34,288 km, or 97 percent o fthe total length, was completed.

In December 2004, the Chinese government approved an expanded NTHS, or the "7918
Highway Network." The plan to build 7 capital radials, 9 north-south major highways and 18
east-west corridors, totaling some 85,000 km o f high-grade expressways, i s expected to be
completed in2020. The "791 8 Highway Network" was designed to reach more than one billion
people in China by connecting all provincial capitals and large urban centers of more than
500,000 inhabitants with cities o f more than 200,000 inhabitants. The network location intends


                                                  15

to allow people in eastern areas to access an expressway within half an hour, the central
provinces within an hour, and the western areas within two hours. In addition, it will improve
communications between economically developed areas, such as the Yangtze and Pearl River
Deltas inthe east and the midwest and northeast areas. It will also enhance the connections with
the west, and will promote the economic growth o f central and southeastern provinces, including
Jiangxi.

Jiangxi Province

Jiangxi province i s about 160,000 km2,has 12 cities and 77 counties with a 2004 population o f
43 million. Its neighboring provinces are Hubei, Hunan and Anhui, as well as the coastal
provinces o f Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. Jiangxi i s famous for its combination o f natural
landscape and rich cultural heritage. Jiangxi's plans to rise in the middle o f China are based on
industrialization and opening to the outside by integrating the province with the Yangtze and
Zhujiang river deltas, along with Fujian province. The major cities are Nanchang (capital),
Jiujiang, Ganzhou, Jingdezhen, Jian, and Ruijin.

Jiangxi's main transport network i s based on highways and waterways that developed around the
national highways and the Gan River as the main arteries. The primary network connects the
capital Nanchang with main urban cities and the neighboring provinces. The whole network i s
formed on a "3 vertical, 4 horizontal" expressway skeleton, with Jingdezhen-Yiwu, Jiujiang-
Lichuang, and Wuning-Longnan expressways to the north and south, as well as Zhiyuan-
Ruichang, Liyuan-Jinyushi, Guangchang-Lianhua, and Ruijin-Chuengyi expressways to the east
and west.     Along the expressway skeleton, main lines in the network are clustered around
Jiangxi's major industrial areas that generate the highest passenger and cargo flow in the
province. Of Nanchang's exports, only two percent are exported through Xiamen, which i s the
closest port. Most o f the exports use Shanghai (40 percent), Shenzhen (37 percent) and the
remaining through Ningbo. The lack o f a high-quality transport link to Fujian province has
constrained Jiangxi's accessibilityto the seaport at Xiamen.

Ganzhou City Prefecture. At the west end of the RGE expressway, and home to the LRIP
roads, Ganzhou City Prefecture has under its jurisdiction one prefecture, two cities and 15
counties.    It is the largest administrative zone in the province.   The area o f the entire city
prefecture is 39,390 km2,which i s about 23.5 percent o f the area o f the province. The 2003
population of the city was 8.3 million.        Its topography i s mainly hilly and some basins
surrounded by mountains. The average elevation i s about 500 m above sea level. There are
rivers runningsouth-north and east-west and the GanRiver i s the most important.

The forest area o f Ganzhou i s very large and the area i s rich inundergroundminerals with more
than 64 kinds of proven solid minerals, most o f them nonferrous and rare metals. It i s an
industrialized city prefecture mainly dedicated to metallurgy, electrical power, coal, chemical
machinery, timber industry, building materials, food and textiles. It has unique scenic spots,
beautiful landscape, a longstanding history, relics and a cultural heritage that provides the basis
for rich natural and cultural resources.

RuijinCity. At the east end ofthe expressway, the city has an area of 2,448 km2andhas under
its jurisdiction seven towns, ten townships and 237 village committees with 601,265 inhabitants



                                                 16

in2003. It has 26 kindsofprovenreserves such as gold, tungsten, uranium, rare earth, coal and
limestone. Ruijinhas a long history, beautiful landscape, many tourism resources and i s famous
for its revolutionary base as the starting point o f the Long Marchin 1935.

Huichang, Yudu and Gan Counties. BetweenRuijinand Ganzhouthere are three counties rich
inminerals, forest andtourism. HuichangCounty with a 2003 populati'on of433,690 is adjacent
to Fujian and Guangdong provinces. Yudu County, located east o f Ganzhou Prefecture, has
902,351 inhabitants (2003) and an area o f 2,893 km2. Gan County has an area o f 2,993 km2and
557,000 inhabitants (2003). It i s locatedinthe upstreamarea ofthe Gan River.

Highways. In 2003 Jiangxi had 61,233 km o f roads, with a road density o f 36.7 km/km2. The
roads consist of: 1,040 km o f expressways; 330 km Class I;7,372 km Class 11; 5,606 km Class
111; and 23,443 km Class IV. Class I1and above roads account for 14.3 percent o fthe total road
length, while Class IV and above roads account for 61.7 percent o f the total length. All the
counties, and 79.3 percent o f administrative villages, have road access.

Recently, Jiangxi has concentrated on expressway construction. The length o f expressways in
operation increased from 420 km in 2000 to 1,040 km by the end o f 2003, a 148 percent
increase. Duringthe same period, the national expressway lengths increased by 82 percent from
 16,3 14 kmto 29,745 km.

Road transportation i s the main mode in Jiangxi's transportation system. In 2003, Jiangxi had
 53,000 road transportation business operators, 260,000 people in transportation employment,
 110,000 operating vehicles, and 5,065 passenger routes (including 1,25 1 interprovincial lines).
 This same year, Jiangxi also reached a total passenger volume of 332 million persons, 181.3
million person-km o f passenger movement, 210 million tons o f cargo volume, and 16.2 billion
ton-km o f cargo movement.

 Railway. The total length o f Jiangxi's railways in operation is 3,044 km (2005) out o f the
 national length o f about 75,000 km. Jiangxi has five arterial and 11 secondary lines. The five
 arterial lines are: Zhegan, Jingjiu, Yingxia, Yuangan, and Wujiu. The main line i s Jingjiu
 railway line (connecting Beijing and Hong Kong), which i s the main north-southline that crosses
 22 counties and has 715 km. The main east-west line i s the Zhegan railway with 564 km that
 connects middle and southwestern China.

 Waterways. In 2003, Jiangxi's waterways accommodated a total o f 3.88 million passengers,
 82 millionperson-km o f movement, 18.48 million tons o f cargo volume, and five billion ton-km
 o f cargo movement.

 The Ganjiang-Poyang drainage system covers most o f the province and empties into the Yangtze
 River, which forms part o f the province's northern border. Poyang Lake, at 3,583 km2,is
 China's largest freshwater lake. The Gan River and Poyang Lake waterways are Jiangxi's main
 waterways, which are further connected with 62 navigable rivers, making a total o f 5,560 km o f
 waterways in the province.      Class waterways amount to 41 percent o f the system and are
 comprised o f 156 km Class IV; 214 km Class V; 741 km Class VI; and 1,160 km Class VII.

 Jiangxi has 1,188 inland harbor berths (39,679 m inlength). There are 55 ports that are capable
 o f handlingmore than 10,000 tons o f cargo annually. The port o f Jiujiang can handle six million


                                                    17

tons o f cargo a year, with the ports of Nanchang, Zhangshu, Ji'an, Ganzhou and Boyang all
having annual capacities o f over one milliontons.

Bythe end o f 2003, Jiangxi had4,581 civilian transport vessels that provided 570,000 net tons of
capacity and 15,900 passenger spaces. With the development o f vessel capacity, a large number
o f old-fashioned wooden boats became obsolete and were replaced by steel, large tonnage,
multifunctional, and energy-efficient vessels. Interms o f route development, Jiangxi has started
reaching its goals o f stabilizing inland waterways, developing Yangtze River transport,
extendingbusiness toward the coastal areas, and exploring maritime transportation opportunities.
With this goal, Jiangxi's river and ocean fleet has developed from one vessel to 32 vessels; the
maritime fleet has developed to five vessels with 320,000 tonnages, covering more than ten
countries and regions.       This has become the main means of transportation for Jiangxi's
international trade.

Air Transport. The Changbei airport locatedinNanchang i s the province's main airport, which
i s supplemented with airports located in Ganzhou, Jingdezhen, Jiujiang, and Jingangshan. In
2004, the Nanchang airport was designated as an international airport and open to foreign flights.
Since then, several international flights were authorized including Nanchang-Guangzhou-
Singapore, Nanchang-Shanghai-Seoul, andNanchang-Shanghai-Los Angeles.

Vehicle Fleet. The number o f private automobiles in the province reached 300,679 (2002),
which included 73,203 buses and 176,499 trucks. During the period 1990-2002 the number o f
private automobiles increased annually by an average of 8.2 percent and buses by 13.3 percent.

Sector Issues for China and Jiangxi Province

China needs to address the following issues to reduce risks and bottlenecks inits transport sector:

0    Government and Administration. China's government bodies need to adapt to their new
     roles as regulators. Because the central government has only limited powers over provinces,
     and China lacks a single, national ministry responsible for all transport modes, the pace of
     administrative reform varies from province to province. Furthermore, because government
     bodies have maintained a strong cultural reluctance to cross jurisdictional boundaries,
     services that require cooperation across suchboundaries have developed slowly.

0    Regional Disparities.      Provinces along China's eastern seaboard have benefited from
     logistical accessibility and well-developed infrastructure, thereby growing more quickly than
     their western counterparts. The northeast, the seat o f much o f China's early heavy industry
     and still dominated by state-owned enterprises, is now highly polluted and suffering high
     unemployment. Current central government efforts aim to narrow the widening wealth and
     income disparities among regions by attracting more domestic and foreign investment to the
     interior.

Inadditionto the nationalissues, Jiangxi province mustaddressseveral keyissues:

 0   The Need for Improved High-Grade Access to Key Facilities.                 Lack o f transport
     accessibility i s one o f the constraints to the social and economic development o f these



                                                  18

  southern landlocked mountainous areas. The RGE expressway will link Ganzhou and the
  area east to an expressway currently under construction inFujianprovince. This will provide
  a high-quality transport link to the coastal port and international airport at Xiamen (Fujian
  province).    In the future, the network will continue to develop westward, eventually
  connecting with Chengdu (Sichuan province) and Kunming(Yunnan province).

0 The Need for Improved LocalRoad Access to Markets and Services. The Ganzhou City
  Prefecture i s poorly served by local roads. Local roads, Class IV and unclassified roads,
  account for about 77percent o f the total mileage (8,901 km) o f the road network in the
  Ganzhou City Prefecture; and more thanhalfo f these roads are unpaved.

0 The Need for Improved Sector Management. The previous two Bank highway projects
  have helped the JPCD improve their operations in a number o f key areas, such as safety and
  road maintenance; however, more needs to be done. There i s a need to further improve
  planning and safety processes at the JPCD, as well as to assist them in implementing better
  quality assurance. There i s also a need to start the delivery o f HIV/AIDS education in the
  sector.

                            CHINA: ThirdJiangxi Highway Project


COMPONENT RUIJIN-GANZHOU
               A:                    EXPRESSWAY     (RGE)

The RGE will be a 117 km long section (about US$627 million) o f the Xiamen-Chengdu
expressway, which i s one of the east-west corridors o f the NTHS. With the main north-south
corridors now complete, the focus i s shiftingto providing east-west linkages, thereby completing
network connectivity. The RGE will start inRuijin City, at a point located about 31 km west o f
the FujiadJiangxi border. It will end near Ganzhou City, at the starting point o f an existing
expressway linking Ganzhou City to the Guangdong-Nanchang expressway.

A 31km expressway section between Ruijinand the Fujian provincial border will be built using
a BOT scheme defined on a concession contract already signed for a 22-year period (this BOT i s
considered linked to the RGE project so the Bank's safeguard policies will apply). This BOT
section will be opened to traffic before the RGE. A new expressway inFujian, due to be open to
traffic inlate 2006, will connect the BOT with the Fujian expressway network. Jiangxi province
has made a commitment that the BOT section will be completed prior to the RGE. They are
using the BOT rather than including this section in the RGE so that their expressway network
can be connected to Fujian province at the earliest opportunity.

Inthe west near Ganzhou City the expressway will connect with an expressway section already
completed and connected to the World Bank-financed Second Jiangxi Highway project. With
the completion of these expressways, Ganzhou will have direct, high-quality road access to
Xiamen and Jiangxi province will have a cross-provincial link with its two north-south
expressways.

The area crossed by the RGE is mountainous with rivers. The terrain i s very challenging and
required careful route selection and designs so as to minimize the environmental and social
impacts while providing adequate access to local communities.

Main Characteristics

This is a list o f the main characteristics of RGE as reflected in the preliminary engineering
design:


0   length: 116.8 km;


0   designspeed: 100km/h;

0   cost estimate: Y 5.06 billion, or USS627 million (average cost o f US$5.4 milliodkm);

Location

The project area lies in Ganzhou City Prefecture. The expressway runs roughly parallel to the
existing NR 323.

The RGE i s one section o f Xiacheng expressway, an expressway planned between Xiamen in
Fujianprovince and Chengdu in Sichuan province. Xiacheng is 2,63 1kmlong and successively
crosses Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Chongqing and Sichuan.              In Jiangxi province,
Xiacheng i s about 245 kmlong and includes four sections:

   Section A between Fujian border and the west o f Ruijini s about 31 km and crosses Ruijin
   county;

   Section B (the RGE) between the west o f Ruijin and the west o f Ganzhou i s about 117 km
   long and i s the main component o f the ThirdJiangxi HighwayProject (JHP3);

   Section C west o f Ganzhou connects the RGE and the Taihe-Ganzhou expressway (TGE i s
   the main component o f the Second Jiangxi Highwayproject-JHP2)         and i s 11kmlong. This
   i s already built and i s presently used as an interconnecting road linking TGE to Ganzhou
   City; and

   Section D i s planned between the west o f TGE and the Hunan border and will be about
   88 km long and located in a mountainous area, although the technical studies have not as yet
   started.

An agreement was reached between Fujian and Jiangxi on the alignment o f the Xiacheng
expressway at the border crossing. On the Fujian side, the section o f the Xiacheng near the
border with Jiangxi i s already under construction. Works started in September 2004 and are
expected to be completed by the end o f 2006. The border betweenFujianand Jiangxi i s located
inthe 1.4 kmlongAiling tunnel (800 minFujian and 600 minJiangxi). The contractors ofthe
Fujianside will end their work at the border. The contractors selected by Jiangxi will have to
complete the Ailing tunnel to the border with Fujian. An agreement between both the provinces

on the Ailing tunnel operation and maintenance activities, including interventions incase o f fire,
remains to be reached.

Cities and Counties Crossed by RGE

The BOT (Section A) is fully located in Ruijin County. The RGE (Section B) crosses five
counties or cities: Ruijin City, Huichang County, Yudu County, Gan County, and Ganzhou
District of Ganzhou City Prefecture. All the area crossedby sections A and B i s within Ganzhou
Prefecture, which comprises two cities (Ganzhou and Ruijin) and 15 counties.

There are almost three million inhabitants along the route, which accounts for 35 percent o f the
total population in Ganzhou City Prefecture and seven percent o f the province. It i s also
30 percent o fthe total area o f Ganzhou City Prefecture and seven percent o f the entire province.

The recommended alignment totals 116.8 km in length and was designed to serve Huichang,
Yudu and Ganzhou and to be in accordance with the development plans o f these cities or
counties.

General Description of Area

The area crossed by the RGE is a succession of three basins separated by mountains: the Ruijin
basin (200 mhigh),the Yudu basin (200 mhigh) and the Ganzhoubasin (100 mhigh). Between
these basins the mountains are high, some exceeding 1,000 m o f altitude.          The main river
between Huichang and Ganzhou i s the Gong. In Ganzhou, the Gong River becomes the Gan
River. The Gong River links the Yudubasin with the Ganzhoubasinvia a narrow valley.

The geology o f the area includes mudstone, which may be not stable, limestone with presence o f
karst holes, red sandstone and metamorphic rock, which do not raise major problems. Various
nonactive faults can be detected. The geology at the entrance and exits o f two long tunnels raise
important difficulties.

Existing Roads and Railways

The existing NR 323 links Ruijinand Ganzhou cities. It was realigned and upgraded to Class I1
(12 m wide) in recent years so the condition i s good. It i s located in the Gong river valley


                                                29

between Ganzhou and the east o f Yudu, including a passage through a narrow valley. Then it
uses secondary valleys with a low pass and a long detour before joining the Ruijin basin. It
crosses various towns like Jiangkou (Gan County), Yudu (Yudu County), Xiaomi and Xijiang
(Huichang county).      NR 323 is the only east-west road parallel to the expressway.        The
feasibility study indicates a traffic volume o f 7,000-12,000 passenger car units (PCU)/day in
2005. The traffic volumes are low inrural areas and increase inurbanized areas.

The current distance fkom Ruijin to Ganzhou on NR 323 i s about 150 km and takes about 2.5
hours. This will be significantly reduced to about 120km, with a travel time o f about 1.25 hours,
after the expressway i s constructed.

Further to the east, NR 323 i s the key road section that connects Ruijinwith Linchang. It starts
in Ruijin and ends inXiaomeiguan in Dayu County. Its standard and passing capacity is very
poor. The road section that runs along the river i s fkequently flooded and the traffic i s
interrupted. Inaddition, pedestrians, bicycles and rickshaws mix together and result in crowded
carriageways with very dangerous driving conditions. There are also a large proportion o f heavy
vehicles andmost trucks are overloaded.

Ruijinis bypassedby a good Class I1road. The NR 319 links Ruijinto the border with Fujianin
the east. It also links Ruijinwith NingxinCounty inthe North. This i s a good Class I1road.

NR 206 crosses Jiangxi province from the Anhui border inthe northto the Guangdong border in
the south andcrosses Ruijin.

A two-track railway from Beijing to Guangzhou passes by Ganzhou and Jiangkou. A new one-
track railway from Ganzhou to Longyan in Fujian province opened to traffic in May 2005 for
freight and in October 2005 for passengers. It crosses the Jiangxi/Fujian border at the same
location as the Ailing tunnel but through another tunnel located about 40 m above where the
Ailing tunnel is beingbuilt. Most ofthe time, this new railway alignment follows the corridor o f
NR 323.

The section o f Ganlong railway in Jiangxi i s about 170 km long. It begins in Ganzhou and
crosses Gan County, Yudu and Ruijinand ends in Longyan in Fujianprovince. Its construction
was recently completed (2004) and it i s presently inoperation.

The route o f the RGE intersects with: (a) NR 323 twice and with NR 105 once; (b) several
provincial highways; (c) the Ganlong railway line twice; (d) the Gong River twice and the Gan
River once.

COMPONENT LOCALB:         ROADS   IMPROVEMENT     PROGRAM

The Local Roads Improvement Program (LRIP) o f approximately U S 7 4 million aims to
improve access in poor areas o f the province. The LRIP will be implemented in two phases.
The Phase Iprogram includes the Chuengyi - Fengzhou (48.5 km) and Meicun - Longbu roads
(34.8 km). These existing roads will have upgraded pavement, improved alignment and will be
widened. The existing sections on either side o f both LRIP roads have already been upgraded.
Designs for the works were completed in late 2005, with a planned construction date at the
beginning o fthe second quarter 2006.


                                                30

Ganzhou City Prefecture, which i s the largest prefecture in the province, i s the priority area for
the LRIP, and i s where the expressway component will be built. Currently its road network
density is about 0.23 km/km2,about 38 percent lower than the average road density (0.37 kml
km2)inthe province. Of the total mileage of 11,544 kminGanzhou City Prefecture, 8,901 km
o f roads are Class IV or unclassified, some 2 percent lower than the average for the province. As
one o f the poorest prefectures with the lowest densities o f road network in the province, the
LRIP component will support high-priority needs o f local access.

The LRIP component aims at improving the highway network inpoor areas o f the province in
order to promote economic and social development and contribute to poverty alleviation. The
Bank and the JPCD agreed that the size o f the LRIP should be about ten percent o f the total
project cost and the amount of the Bank financing shall be US$lO million. Since construction
will commence prior to the signingo f the Loan Agreement, retroactive financing will need to be
applied.

The LRIP roads are part o f the five-year highway improvement program o f Ganzhou City
Prefecture. The following criteria were adopted inPhase Ito select the roads (the additional road
sections for Phase I1will be identifiedusingthese same selection criteria):

0    expected positive impact o f the project on population access to education, health and other
     production and/or commercialization o f localproducts;
0    strong support by local government andresidents;
0    the technical standard after construction for upgrading for the major part o f the program
     should be Class I11or Class IV roads;
0    current minimum daily traffic volumes o f 400 medium truck equivalent (MTE) for Class IV
     and 500 MTEfor Class I11roads;
0    the contribution to the Jiangxi provincialplanto improve the functional responsiveness o fthe
     highway network with good traffic growth potential; and
0    expected EIRR higher than 12 percent

COMPONENT INSTITUTIONAL
               C:                   STRENGTHENING

As the thirdhighway project inJiangxi, the institutional strengthening componentwas developed
after reviewing the outcomes from the previous activities. Where these earlier activities were
supply driven (as opposed to demand-driven) they could not be sustained. Consequently, in
establishing the institutional strengthening activities for JHP3, the focus was on ensuring that
they met the specific needs o f the JPCD. This led to the following institutional strengthening
component o f about US$10 million:

0    Traffic Safety Operations for Tunnels.          A tunnel safety management plan will be
     established to ensure that there are adequate resources and procedures to handle tunnel
     emergencies. This plan will consider both technical and operational factors so as to ensure
     that all parties responding to a tunnel emergency are clear in their roles, have appropriate
     equipment, and correct operating procedures to respond ina timely manner. The study, to be
     completedby 2007, will produce a series o f recommendations that will form the basis for the
     JPCD to implement a province-wide tunnel safety policy.



                                                 31

0  Traffic Safety Improvementfor Expressways. This activity, to be completedby2008, will
   improve traffic safety conditions on expressways. Detailed accident records will be analyzed
   to identify countermeasures for roadside facility-related accidents.       It will result in a
   decision-making support system for roadside facility planning, design and operations. It will
   contribute toward establishing appropriate roadside safety technical policies for the JPCD.

0  Implementation of Electronic Toll Collection. The current five-year plan calls for the
   implementation o f electronic toll collection (ETC) on expressways in China. This will be
   done through a dual-use integrated circuit (IC) card system, which can be manually swiped
   or automatically recorded through a transponder.        With the technology selected, the
   implementation o f ETC in Jiangxi i s not so much a technological issue but primarily a
   business process issue. This activity will identify what actions are required in order to
   successfully implement province-wide ETC on expressways.            By 2007 it will prepare
   recommendations on changes to business process, financial flows, as well as any technology
   issues. The outcome will be a strategy that can be adopted by the JPCD to implement ETC.

0  Training. Domestic and foreign training activities will cover a range of topics including
   design, safety, maintenance, management, finance and the environment.

0  Equipment. Equipmentwill be procured for expressway management andmaintenance, and
   environmental monitoring. These will include weighing stations, quality control sets and
   road condition monitoring equipment.

Two separate projects funded by grants to further strengthen the JPCD's institutional capacities
will beundertakenat the same time as the JHP3:

0  HIV/AIDS.The JPCD will develop the ability to execute effective anti-HIV/AIDS activities
   for its staff, as well as those o f contractors, other workers and local residents where
   construction projects are under way.       An anti-HIV/AIDS education program will be
   conducted for JPCD staff, workers on the JHP3 construction sites and local residents. This
   activity will be funded by an IDF Grant.

0  Micro-Enterprises for Road Maintenance. In conjunction with Fujian province, a study
   will be done to investigate the viability o f using micro-enterprises to maintain local roads,
   applying techniques used in Latin America and elsewhere. This study will include pilot
   testing o f micro-enterprises on paved and unpaved roads inboth provinces. An application
   has been made to PPIAF to fund this project.

                            Annex 6: ImplementationArrangements
                            CHINA: ThirdJiangxiHighwayProject

The project will be implemented by the Jiangxi Provincial Communications Department (JPCD)
and the agencies at the cityldistrict level responsible for road management in Jiangxi Province.
The Ruijin-Ganzhou Expressway (RGE) Project Management Office (PMO) under the JPCD has
coordinated the project preparation and will remain the Bank's main counterpart during
implementation. Similar arrangements were made on the two previous Bank-financed highway
projects inJiangxi and have proved very effective.

The Jiangxi Provincial High-class Highway Administration Bureau (JPHHAB) will operate and
maintain the RGE after it i s opened to traffic. The PMO has appointed the Communications
Design Institute o f Jiangxi Province (CDIJP) and No. 2 Survey and Design Institute under M O C
to carry out design studies for the project. The PMO will manage construction works as the
"Client" with the assistance o f a domestic supervision organization.        Foreign supervision
consultants will be usedon an as-neededbasis.

With respect to resettlement, the Project Resettlement Office (PRO) under the PMOhas prepared
the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The PRO will lead the resettlement operations under the
oversight of the key PMO of Jiangxi Province. This i s led by the Vice-Governor and manages
multilevel resettlement offices established along the alignment in counties (citieddistrict) and
towns. Other relevant government agencies responsible for planning, financing, communications
and land administration will be involved at different levels. The PRO has been staffed with
experienced experts andtheir responsibilitieshave beenspecified inthe RAP. The RAP includes
a detailed trainingprogram for the capacity buildingo f the PRO.

The PMO will issue a specific regulation for the approval and use o f resettlement funds. The
payment process to beneficiaries will be streamlined to avoid possible fund deductions during
the disbursement, and each affected village will have a specific account in local banks. The
designated banks will report daily on the use o f resettlement fund items to the PMO for internal
monitoring. The P M O will also strengthen the capacity o f town-level and county-level staff to
manage the resettlement funds.

For the environment, the PMO has prepared an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the
RGE, which includes practical and cost-effective measures necessary to mitigate the
environmental impacts o f the project by incorporating them in the design and by implementing
them during the construction and operation phases. The EMP also specifies the appropriate
monitoring plans, training, institutional arrangements, implementation schedule, budget needs,
etc. necessary to implement the mitigation measures and strengthen the borrower's capacity.
Since the project is the third World Bank-financed project in Jiangxi Province, the JPCD has
developed ample internal capacity in its environment unit to implement, supervise and monitor
the EMP.

With respect to the Local Roads Improvement Program (LRIP), the Ganzhou City Traffic
AdministrationBureau (GCTAB) under the Ganzhou City Government o f Jiangxi Province has
identified and prepared two local roads to be included in Phase I.The Gannan Survey and
Design Institute o f Jiangxi Province and the Traffic Planning and Design Institute of Jiangxi


                                                 34

Province have designed the LRIP roads; Hongtai Investment Company Ltd. under GCTAB will
handle procurement; resettlement and environment will be under the oversight o f the PMO; and
works will be managed with the assistance o f domestic firms for supervision.                The
implementation of the EMPs prepared for each road section will be supervisedby the PMO.

Finally, the P M O i s preparingthe institutional strengthening and policy development component
and will coordinate the implementation o f activities. Depending on activities, other units from
the JPCD will contribute.

The P M O will be responsible for procurement on the project. The PMO staff have experience in
procurement from the previous two World Bank-financed projects in Jiangxi; thus they are
familiar with the Bank's procurement principles and procedures.

The procurement will be done by an experienced procurement company.

             Annex 7: Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements
                            CHINA: ThirdJiangxi HighwayProject

The Bank's financial management assessment, based on guidelines issued by the Financial
Management Sector Board on November 3, 2005, has concluded that the project: (a) meets
minimumBank financial management requirements, as stipulated inBP/OP 10.02; and (b) will
have inplace an adequate project financial management system that can provide, with reasonable
assurance, accurate and timely information on the status o f the project in the reporting format
agreed for the project and as required by the Bank.

Funding sources for the project include the Bank loan and counterpart funds. The Bank loan
proceeds will flow from the Bank into the project Designated Account (DA) to be set up at and
managed by the Jiangxi Provincial Finance Department (JPFD), to the project implementing
agencies, and finally to contractors or suppliers. The Bank loan will be signed between the Bank
and the People's Republic o f China through its Ministry o f Finance (MOF), and onlending
agreements for the Bank loan will be signed between M O F and the Jiangxi Provincial
Government through its JPFD, and then between JPFD and the Jiangxi Provincial
Communications Department (JPCD), and Ganzhou Prefecture through its Ganzhou Finance
Bureau (GFB).

The constitution o f counterpart funds will be appropriations from central, provincial and
municipal governments and commercial debt.

N o outstanding audits or audit issues exist with any o f the implementing agencies involved inthe
project. However, the Bank will continue to be attentive to financial management matters during
project supervision.

Audit Arrangement

The Bank requires that project financial statements be audited in accordance with standards
acceptable to the Bank. In line with other Bank-financed projects in China, the project will be
audited in accordance with International Auditing Standards and the Government Auditing
Standards of the People's Republic o f China. The Jiangxi Provincial Audit Office was identified
as auditors for the project. Annual audit reports will be issued by above audit office and subject
to reviews by the China National Audit Office (CNAO).            The Bank currently accepts audit
reports issued by CNAO or provincial/regional audit bureaus/offices for which CNAO i s
ultimately responsible.

The annual audit report o f the project consolidated financial statements will be due to the Bank
within six months after the end o f each calendar year. This requirementis stipulated inthe Loan
and Project agreements. Consolidated project financial statements shall be submitted by the
PMO by June 30 each year.

FundsFlow and Disbursement Arrangements

Funds flow for the Bank loan will follow Bank and MOF requirements.              One DA will be
established and managedby JPFD. The funds flow will be as follows:

Strengths. JPFD has managed two Bank-financed projects and has accumulated extensive
experience in project financial management and disbursement, which will benefit the
implementation of this project. Additionally, the PMO i s currently implementing the Second
Jiangxi Highway Project (JHP2) and will share its experience andtrain the Ganzhou LRIP-PMO.

Weaknesses and Action Plan. As shown below, only one significant weakness was identified.
The accompanying action plan shows how this was addressed.

           ImplementingEntities

JPCD has issued authorization to establish the PMO to implement the project. Most o f the PMO
staff worked on the proceeding JHP2, and so already have experience with Bank-financed
projects. The LRIP-PMO was set up by Ganzhou Hongtai Investment Company Ltd., a wholly
owned subsidiary o f Ganzhou Prefecture Government, to implement the LRIP component. The
PMO will provide technical support to the LRIP-PMO as well as supervise project
implementation.

           Budgeting

Although the cost table was prepared for the project, and the project will prepare its annual
implementing plan, from experience the budgeting system within projects i s usually not well
maintained or monitored. The Financial Management Specialist will work with the related
agencies to improve their budgeting system duringproject implemenation.

           Accounting

The administration, accounting and reporting o f the project will be set up in accordance with
Circular #13: "Accounting Regulations for World Bank Financed Projects" issued in January
2000 by MOF. The circular provides in-depth instructions for accounting treatment o f project
activities and covers the following:


0     Chart o f account;
 0    Detailed accounting instructions for each project account;
 0    Standard set o f project financial statements; and
 0    Instructions on the preparation o f project financial statements.

The standard set o f project financial statements mentioned above was agreed to between the
Bank and MOF and applies to all Bank projects appraised after July 1, 1998 and includes the
 following:


 0    Balance Sheet;
 0    Summary o f Sources and Uses o f Fundsby Project Component;
 0    Statement o f Implementation o f Loan Agreement;
 0    Designated Account Statement; and
 0    Notes to the Financial Statements.




                                                    40

Each o f the implementing agencies will be managing, monitoring and maintaining respective
project accounting records. The original supporting documents for project activities will be
retainedby the originating implementingagencies.

Adequate project accounting staff with educational background and work experience
commensurate with the work they are expected to perform i s one o f the factors critical to the
successful implementation o f project financial management. Based on discussions, observations
and review o f the educational background and work experience of the staff identified for
financial and accounting positions inimplementing agencies, the task team had reservations that
some o f the staff were appropriate for the work they are expected to assume.

To strengthen the financial management capacity and achieve a consistent quality o f accounting
work, a project financial management manual (the Manual) was prepared. The Manual provides
detailed guidelines on financial management, internal controls, accounting procedures, fund and
asset management and withdrawal application procedures. The Bank reviewed the Manual and
found to be acceptable.

As some o f the financial staff are new to World Bank projects, a well-designed and focused
training program in project financial management and disbursement will be provided by JPFD
prior to project effectiveness to all financial and accounting staff to ensure a good understanding
andknowledge o fthe following:

0   The Bank's financial management policy and disbursement procedures;
0   Fund/asset/contract management;
0   Format and content o fproject financial statements;
0   Audit requirement; and
0   Onlending andrepaymentmanagement.

The implementing agencies will use the computerized financial management system Golden
Butterfly (Jin Die), a well-established Chinese accounting software package approved by MOF,
for the project. The task team will monitor the processing o f accounting work closely, especially
inthe initial stages to ensure complete and accurate financial information will be provided in a
timelymanner.

        Internal ControlandInternalAuditing

The related accounting policy, procedures and regulations were issued by MOF and the project
will follow these documents. The funds flow will be arranged and monitored through the
channel o f the finance bureau and will be based on an expenditure reimbursement basis.

There is no formal independent internal audit department for the project. However, this will not
impact on the project's financial management as JPFD management, monitoring and annual
external audits will serve as the mechanism to ensure that financial management controls are
functioning appropriately.

         FinancialReporting

The format and content o fthe project financial statements represent the standard project financial
reporting package agreed to between the Bank and MOF, and was discussed and agreed to with
all parties concerned.   In line with the Financial Monitoring Report (FMR) guidelines, the
unaudited project consolidated financial statements will be submitted as part o f the FMR to the
Bank on a semiannual basis (prior to August 15 and February 15 o f the following year), and will
include the following four statements:

0   Balance Sheet;
0   Summaryo f Sources and Uses o fFundsbyProject Component;
0   Statement o f Implementation of Loan Agreement; and
0   Designated Account Statement.

Both the PMO and LRIP-PMO will prepare financial statements on their implemented
components, which will then be used by the PMO for preparing the consolidated project
financial statements and submitted to the Bank for review and comment on a regular basis.

         Financial Covenants

No additional financial covenants were proposed by the Financial Management Specialist other
than the standard financial covenants, (e.g., maintaining project accounts in accordance with
sound accountingpractices, audit requirement and SOE), as described inthe legal document.

         Supervision Plan

A detailed supervision plan for this project was included as part o f the China Audit Strategy
document. This document takes into consideration o f the size of project and the financial
management risk rating o f this project.

Bank and will be procured usingnational competitive bidding (NCB) procedures. Other works
estimated to cost at or more than US$12 million equivalent per contract will be procured under
the international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures, and works estimated to cost less than
US$12 million equivalent per contract under the N C B procedures. The procurement will be
done usingthe Bank's current Standard BiddingDocuments (SBD) for all ICB contracts and the
Bank-approved Chinese Model Bidding Document (MBD) (dated May 1997 and issued by
MOF) for all NCB contracts. In case o f adopting MBDs, all new revisions to the Bank SBD
since 1997 will be incorporated.

Procurement of Goods. Goods procuredunder this project will include contracts for equipment
for expressway management and maintenance and the environment. The total estimated cost for
the contracts is about US$8.8 million. International competitive bidding, NCB and Shopping

o f the Jiangxi Provincial Communications Department (PMO).           It is comprised o f eight
departments led by one PMO director and four vice directors. Most o f the staff were transferred
from the former PMOS o f previous World Bank- and Asian Development Bank-financed
projects. The key staff for procurement appear to be adequate, given the position they were
assigned. The LRIP-PMO including about 16 persons was established in Ganzhou for the LRIP
component. This agency and its staff are new to Bank projects and therefore inexperienced in
the Bank's procurement rules and guidelines. The PMO will assist them with training and other
advice. As a supplementary resource to the capacity o f the PMO, the China National Machinery
Import & Export Corporation (CMC) was engaged as the procurement agent, and two qualified
design institutes were recruited.    All have worked previously on Bank-financed highway
projects.

An assessment o f the capacity o f the Implementing Agency to implement procurement actions
for the project was carried out by the Procurement Specialist during project preparation. The
assessmentreviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction
between the project's staff responsible for procurement and the JPCD's relevant central unit for
administration and finance. Most o f the issuedrisks concerning the procurement component for
implementation o f the project were identified and include:

0   The capability o f the LRIP-PMO for the LRIP component and its staffs lack o f knowledge
    and experience inthe Bank's procurement policies andprocedures; and
0   The Bank's latest procurement policies and procedures, especially new features o f electronic
    biddingandpublishingcontract award information, andthe Bank's latest versions o f standard
    procurement documents are new to the PMO.

The corrective measures that were agreed are: (a) the PMO shall take full responsibility for
handlingall o fthe LRIP's procurement, insteado f the LRIP-PMO; (b) the Bank's latest standard
documents related to the project shall be reviewed by the PMO and its procurement agent and
design institutes in advance; and (c) the P M O shall complete the selection o f a procurement
agent as soon as possible.

The overall project risk for procurement i s Average.

C. ProcurementPlan

The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation that
provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan was agreed between the Borrower
and the Project Team on January 6, 2006 and i s available at the PMO's office in Nanchang
(Attachment 1). The status o f both the RGE and LRIP designs at appraisal gave confidence that
this planwas realistic.




                                                45

The Procurement Plan will be available in the Project's database and posted to the Bank's
external website after loan approval. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with
the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements ininstitutional capacity.

D. Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision

In addition to the prior-review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity
assessment of the Implementing Agency has recommended supervision missions at six-month
intervals to visit the field to carry out post-review o f procurement actions when some
procurement activities have been carried out, or when some post-review contracts have been
signed and implemented duringthe reviewperiod.

                             CHINA: ThirdJiangxi Highway Project


A.     Preface

The economic evaluation o fthe project covers the following two mainproject components:

0  construction of a 117kmexpressway between RuijinandGanzhou (RGE); and
0  upgrading and improvement of the two local roads (about 83 km) under the Local Roads
   Improvement Program (LRIP).

The analysis is based on the actual and forecast data on traffic volume, vehicle operating cost
(VOC), user's time cost savings, reductions in accident costs and economic project cost. The
main inputs for the evaluation are:

0  capital investment and maintenance costs, reflecting December 2005 prices;
0  the benefit stream, also reflectingDecember 2005 prices, that is comprised o f savings inVOC,
   travel time savings, andreduction inaccident costs;
0  a capital investment period of 2006-2010 and an evaluation o fbenefits period o f 20 years; and
0  the full benefit starting to accrue in July 2009 for the RGE and January 2008 or after,
   depending on the road, for the LRIP.

This Annex contains: (a) the economic evaluation of the RGE, the LRIP and the overall economic
evaluation of the project, including probabilistic risk analysis; (b) a financial analysis o f the RGE
and LRIP components; and, (c) a financial analysis o f the JPCD.

Overview. Jiangxi province is located in the south center o f China. The nearest seaport for this
landlocked rovince i s over 675 km away. The total land area o f Jiangxi province i s about
166,900 km or 68 percent of the size o f the United Kingdom. Jiangxi i s an important inland
            P
transport hub o f China serving the north-south transport corridor and linking the central and
western provinces to the coastal areas inthe east. The northernpart o f the province i s a basinthat

has the largest freshwater lake inChina (Poyang Lake), which links with the Yangtze River. Much
o f southern Jiangxi i s covered by hilly and mountainous terrain.         All the main cities and
manufacturing centers of the province surround the lake and its tributaries. The capital o f the
province i s Nanchang, which i s located at the center o f the province in the north. All the major
long-distance transport modes (railways, highways, inlandwaterway and air transport) converge at
the city. Compared to coastal regions, Jiangxi i s not an advanced province and most o f the
development i s concentrated inthe northern part. Economic development insouthern Jiangxi lags
behindthe rest o f the province. Many local prefectures in southern Jiangxi are classified by the
State as the poorest areas inChina.

Highway Development Plan: Justification for Investment.              In China, the rapid economic
growth in recent years has caused income and development disparities between the coastal
provinces and the inland provinces. To reduce the imbalanced development, the government
embarked onthe National Trunk Highway System (NTHS). One o fthe highways i s to horizontally
connect Xiamen (the largest seaport o f Fujianprovince in eastern China) to four southern inland
provinces (Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou and Sichuan). This highway will start inXiamen and end in
Chengdu (the capital o f Sichuan). The total lengtho f the highway will be about 2,631 km. The
total lengtho f the highway inJiangxi i s about 250 km, which will pass through seven major cities
insouthern Jiangxi. TheRGE(117km)is the easternsection ofthe highway inJiangxi andwillbe
able to provide the shortest land transport from Nanchang to Xiamen port (625 km), compared to
Shanghai port (873km), Ningbo port (770 km, Zhejiang province) and Shenzhen port (675 km,
Guangdong province). The construction o f the highway inFujianprovince (260 km)i s expected to
be completed in 2006. The RGE i s the only missing section o f the Nanchang-Xiamen Corridor.
Completion o f the RGE will improve accessibility for this remote hilly and mountainous region,
as well as help balance the income and economic development within the province. Given the
important role o f the RGE for the province and for the State, the project has the highest priority in
Jiangxi's highway development plan.

CurrentCondition of the RGE Corridor (without the project). There are several local roads
in the highway corridor, but only two roads (NR 323 and NR 319) would be significantly
affected by the RGE. The current pavement conditions o f these two roads are good/ fair. The
alignments result in low speeds and high safety risks. For the NR 323 road as an example, the
estimated motorized traffic for 2005 was about 7,000-12,000 passenger car units (PCU) per day
throughout its length. The non-motorized and other traffic (bicycles, animal carts, small farm
tractors andmotorcycles, etc.) are substantial inthe urban areas.

The EstimatedTraffic Growth on the RGE Corridor. The JPCD's estimates of traffic inthe
RGE corridor were made on the basis of routine traffic counts and a comprehensive origin and
destination (O/D) survey that took place in August 2004 (updated in September 2005). The
projections o f normal, generated and diverted traffic were made for 41 zones on the basis o f a
conventional growth model. The traffic on the RGE includes diversion from the existing roads.
The forecasts were further assessed and confirmed by an independent transport consultant hired
by the Bank. Given the historical gross domestic product growth of Jiangxi was 11.7 percent
during 1995-2003 and the current forecasts in coming years (about 7-8 percent), the projected
traffic growth rates in the project corridor are estimated to be 7.9 percent per year in 2005-10,
5.8 percent per year in 2010-20, and 3.8 percent per year in2020-30. The overall traffic growth
rates are summarized as follows:

Alignment Alternatives. The RGE feasibility study considered and compared three main
alternative route alignments between Ruijin and Ganzhou on the basis o f local economic
development, the shortest traveling route, the lowest engineering cost and coordination with the
entire highway networks. The other major criteria for selection o f an alternative were to seek an
alignment that would:      (a) avoid areas that have complex conditions geologically, (b) avoid
possible engineering difficulties, and (c) coordinate comments from the local governments and
peoples. The preferred alignment was selected because of better coordination with the local
economic development plan and local/national transport networks. Details are available in the
feasibility studyreports.

Traffic on the Highway (withthe project). The RGE is planned to become operational inJuly
2009. Diversion ratios o f the corridor traffic on the RGE are based on information provided by
the O/D survey and the traffic studies. They were calculated by usingfinancial VOC for the road
users, with the impacts o f the level o f proposed tolls on the new highway, travel distance and
experience from other recently Bank-financed highways in China. The results of the analysis
indicate that between 55 and 59 percent o f motorized vehicles in 2010, depending on the road
section, may be diverted to the new highway. The traffic diversion i s expected to increase
linearly inthe first ten years to reach 59-65 percent by the year 2020 and stabilize thereafter.

Traffic generated by the new expressway i s assumed to be ten percent o f the normal traffic. This
assumption i s consistent with experience on other recent highway projects inChina. No diversion
o f traffic from the railway to the new highway was assumed. This i s because the much higher
highway tariff does not encourage traffic diversion from the railway (highway tariff is about
Y 0.20-0.25 per ton-km compared with Y 0.04-0.06 per ton-km for railway).             The highway
corridor traffic forecast, by sections, i s summarized as follows:

Economic Costs. Investment costs were converted to economic costs by the elimination o f price
contingency, taxes, custom duty on imported materials and by the application o f shadow price
factors. The resulting overall economic cost i s about 90 percent o f the financial cost.

Economic Benefits. The economic analysis includes the benefits derived from: (a) VOC savings
on the new highway for normal and generated traffic, (b) time savings through relieved
congestion on the existing road, and (c) lower accident costs. The benefits resulting fi-om the
lower level o f congestion were quantified. The value o f passenger time savings was estimated at
Y 1.50 per passenger-hour, on the basis o f updated values from a report on feasibility study
methodology for highways in China. The same sources were used for vehicle accident rates on
different classes o f roads. The values used inthis analysis are summarized as follows:

FengzhouRoad and Meicun-Longbu Road) was identified duringpreparation and i s evaluated in
this annex. Furtherphases ofthe LRIP will befinalized duringproject implementation. The aim
o f the component i s to upgrade low-grade busy roads to Class I1or Class I11with all-weather
accessibility. The total length of the two roads i s 83.3 km. The main characteristics are listed
below:

The current traffic level i s inthe range o f 660 to 1,300 vehicles per day. Since the two roads are
located inthe same district, the local economic development and traffic patterns are quite similar.
The two roads pass through less developed areas and traffic growth rates were conservatively
estimated to be 4.0 percent from 2005 to 2010, reduced by 0.5 percent for each o f the five years
from 2005 to 2030. There is no generated traffic assumed.

Economic Costs and Benefits. Financial costs were converted to economic costs using the
same method and factors as for the RGE, with the following results:

Similar to the RGE, the VOC equations were used to quantify the economic costs and analyze
benefits o f the two roads. The main evaluated benefits would be reduced VOCs through the
provision o f a better road surface, and the associated upgrading o f road class would also result in
higher traffic speeds and improvement o f the road roughness index ensured by all-weather
conditions.

Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis. The best estimates o f EIRRsfor the two roads
range from 16.2 to 28.7 percent. The overall EIRR and N P V (12 percent) for the LRIP are
22.6 percent and Y 291.7 million, respectively.

The risks considered inthe economic evaluation are:

0   slower-than-projected growth o f traffic;
0   higher-than-projected cost of civil works; and
0   lower-than-expected VOC savings.

All these risks were analyzed through sensitivity tests and the evaluation results were found to be
robust for all o f them. For the project component to be unacceptable (i.e,, an EIRR lower than
12percent or a nil N P V at 12percent discount rate), the benefits would have to fall to less than
49.5 percent o f those inthe base case with no change incosts, or the costs would have to increase to

more than 2.03 times those o f the base costs, or the costs would have to increase by 1.34 times and
the benefits fall to 66 percent at the same time.

Additional benefits not included in the EIRR calculations but expected from the project are:
increased income o f rural farmers who live in the poor areas because o f better access to town
markets and jobs, and increased accessibility to schools and hospitals.              The quantifiable
beneficiaries are estimated at: (a) about 2,070 extra children attending school (about ten percent
o f 20,752 children inthe directly served areas), and (b) about 3,710 extra people attending health
services (1percent o f 370,900). Benefits for each are as follows:

Project Risks. All sections o f the RGE and LRIP show acceptable economic returns. The JPCD
has extensive experience inthe construction and operation o f high-grade highways and rural road
projects, thereby minimizing the technical risks associated with the implementation o f the
project. The main tangible risk i s that o f prolonged delays affecting the construction schedule.
The impact o funcertainty was tested through the probabilistic risk analysis.

Probabilistic Risk Analysis.         To determine the degree o f uncertainty for the project, a
probabilistic risk analysis using Monte Carlo techniques was carried out. In a Monte Carlo
analysis, each uncertainty factor is allowed to vary at random between set limits and all
uncertainty factors are allowed to change simultaneously.          Monte Carlo simulation provides
probability distributions o f the potential outcomes o f decisions. By analyzing these distributions,
we can assess the risk associated with makingvarious decisions. The product o f the analysis is a
judgment on the possible range o f the decision variable, and on the likelihood of each value
withinthis range.

The uncertainty factors associated with the economic evaluation o f the project were identified as:
(a) traffic growth rate, (b) traffic diversion ratio to the new expressway, (c) value o f VOC, (d)
changes in capital investment, and (e) one-year delay o f opening. The results o fthe probabilistic
risk analysis show that the EIRR for the most likely scenario is 13.1percent, the low scenario is
6.9 percent and the high scenario i s 19.7 percent. The standard error o f the mean i s 0.4 percent.

C.      Financial Analysis

Preface

The financial evaluation of the project i s comprised of three sections:

0   an assessment of the revenue-earning entity (RGE), focusing on consolidated financial
    statement;
0   an assessment of the nonrevenue-earning entity (LRIP), focusing on financial risk interms o f
    construction, operation and maintenance; and
0   an assessment o f the financial capacity o f the JPCD to sustain highway activities, focusing on
    the adequacy o f funding allocations inthe overall road development plan.

The financial cost o f capital for the RGE i s assumed to be 5.13 percent for the project
(27.2 percent from the Bank at 4 percent, 36.2 percent from the local bank at 6.12 percent and
36.6 percent from the grants at 5 percent).

Financial Evaluation of RGE Component

The RGE will be operated from its opening for traffic (July 2009) by a financially independent
entity, responsible for the day-to-day management, operation and maintenance o f the
expressway. The main income o f the RGE would be derived from tolls charged to road users.
The Jiangxi govemment will set the toll rates.

The Financial Objective. The JPCD has indicated that the financial purpose o f toll collection on
the RGE is to repay the project's Bank and domestic loans, cover operating and nonoperating
expenses and cover routine maintenance. The toll charges are assumed to increase once every
five years (20 percent or an average o f 3.7 percent per year).




                                                  58

Financial Forecast

Tolls. The toll will be charged on the basis o f vehicle size (small passenger cars, large buses,
small trucks, medium trucks, large trucks and trailers) and distance traveled. The same toll i s
used on all expressways inJiangxi. The RGE will be operated as an open toll road. Some traffic
may not pay a toll, including the toll-exempted vehicles (police, ambulance and military), which
are estimated to account for ten percent o f total traffic. The proposed toll rate for the RGE i s as
follows:                     1   ;;; 7; ;:
                                   Toll Charges(Y/vehicle-km)

Operations. The operating costs o f the RGE can be broken down between the working costs
(wage and benefits, maintenance, operating materials and supplies, administration, others) and
depreciation. All other expenses, including interest payments on the loans, are also taken into
account inthe calculation ofthe RGEprofitability.

Profitability. It is estimated that the RGE will generate enough revenue over the loan period to
achieve the above-mentioned financial objective. However, low profitability will take place in
the early years with the repayment o f the Bank and domestic loans. The total interest payment
alone in 2012 (Y 173.97 million), for example, i s about 94.9 percent o f the total operating costs
(Y 183.31million), or consuming 51.8 percent o fthe total revenue (Y 335.8 million) inthat year.
Because o f the low toll growth assumptions, the profitability o f RGE is predicted to be low until
2015 (see the Income statement, page 1o f 3, Attachment 1).

Cash Flow. Despite the low profitability and the financial pressure o f the loan repayments, the
RGE's cash flow should be sufficient to meet all project needs because o f the large sum o f
depreciation reserve, which allows the RGE to meet cash outflows in the early years of
operations. In 2012, for example, the total annual depreciation reserve (Y 151.1 million) will
represent about 4.7 times the total annual working cost (Y 32.23 million), thereby generating
strong internal cash flow and providing sufficient funds for the RGE's operations, maintenance
expenses and loan repayments. It i s estimated that the RGE will not require any external cash
injection and will be able to maintain cash available at least Y 100million every year for the life
of the project (for the sources and applications o f funds, see page2 of 4, Attachment 1).

Leverage and Liquidity. The low profitability and highproportion o f borrowings will dilute the
equity o f the RGE and cause a debtlequity ratio and debtlcapital ratio (the financial leverage o f the
company) above 50 percent until2020. However, this will not affect the liquidityo fthe RGE, as its
liquidityis ensuredby the strong cash flow status. The current ratio will be inthe sound range of
1.1and higher, which should be at least 1.O to avoid short-term solvency problems (balance sheet,
page 3 o f 4, Attachment 1). Inaddition, the JPCD has reiterated its full commitment to the RGE,
guaranteeing its financial viability, releasing an official document to the Bank confirming its full

financial support. The major assumptions and results o fthe financial evaluation are shown inpage
4 o f 4, Attachment 1.

Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR). The low profit margin will impact the FIRR on the
capital investment. The financial evaluation shows that the best-estimate FIRR i s expected to be
0.8 percent with N P V o f Y -2,626 million, at the discount rate o f 5.13 percent. Because o f the
low profitability in early years, the FIRR and N P V will not change much if completion i s
delayed by one year (0.6 percent).

Financial Probabilistic Risk Analysis. To determine the degree o f financial uncertainty for the
project, a probabilistic risk analysis usingMonte Carlo techniques was carried out. The six most
uncertain factors that may affect the financial evaluation were identified: (a) traffic growth rate,
(b) the basic toll level, (c) toll charges growth rate, (d) total working costs, (e) capital investment,
and (f) delay in opening the highway to December 2010. The risk analysis reveals that the most
likely FIRR would be 0.8 percent, while the worst and the best FIRR would, respectively, be
-0.6 percent and 1.9percent. Details are summarized as follows.

FinancialEvaluation of the LRIP Component

The preparation team has some concerns about the availability o f counterpart funds for the LRIP
from Ganzhou city prefecture (see Annex 7). The financial evaluation o f the LRIP components
therefore focused on the JPCD's capacity to minimize financial risks; i.e., their ability to respond
to any lack o f counterpart funds for the construction, including the future maintenance
expenditure o f the LRIP roads.

JPCD budget forecasts show that the investment and maintenance/operation o f the LRIP would
constitute only a small fraction o f the JPCD's fund flows. Based on the JPCD's plan, the capital
investment o f the LRIP will require less than 0.6 percent o f the projected annual total JPCD
revenue. In addition, the required maintenance and operation expenditure o f the LRIP i s less
than 0.13 percent o f the total maintenance expenditure o f the JPCD. These low ratios indicate
that the project presents a modest financial risk as regards the availability o f counterpart funds
for the construction and maintenance o f the project roads. The details are shown inAttachment
2 and summarized as follows:

D.      FinancialEvaluationof the JPCD

The JPCD provided its financing plan forecasts for total revenue and expenditure during the
Tenth Five-Year Plan (loth FYP, 2001-05) and Eleventh Five-Year Plan (llth 2006-10).FYP,
Based on the available information, the financing plan has two features: (a) lesser portion o f
revenue i s invested innew construction, and (b) less dependency on grants from the government.

Based on the JPCD's plan, the total budget for new construction for the1lth      FYP will be about
78.4 percent o f total revenue, compared with 85.5 percent o f the total revenue for the loth FYP.
The lower percentage on new construction will allow the JPCD to allocate more financial
resources to maintenance during 2006-10. The average unit maintenance budget has increased
from Y 7,340h-n for the loth FYP to about Y 8,87O/km in the llth            FYP. The emphasis on
maintenance will reduce deterioration o f the existing road network, causing lower rehabilitation
expenditures inthe longrun.

Although the JPCD budgets for a grant from M O C every year, a moderate self-financing ratio
(total internal cash generation against total revenues) for the 1lth FYP (27.6 percent) will ensure
the implementation o f the development plan even without a grant from MOC. This ratio has
improved since the loth FYP (21.5 percent).           The detailed sources of highway revenue and
expenditures for 2001-10 are shown inAttachment 2.

With regard to the long-term sustainability of road maintenance with the allocatedresources, the
average yearly increase inmaintenance expenditures duringthe 1Oth FYP (5.5 percent) exceeded
the growth o f the road network (0.8 percent), which means a net increase in the average
maintenance expenditure per kilometer. The trend should continue during the llth           FYP with
percentages at 2.9 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively.

A.      Background

Table A 10.1 shows the key components o f the project. The RGE will be constructed entirely on
a new alignment, while the interconnectingroads will be mostly constructed new alignments. As
mentioned earlier, the LRIP roads will mostly follow the exiting road alignments, but would
involve strengthening, minor widening and realignment o f the existing low-grade roads to
increase their transportation capacity, minimize congestion, increase driving visibility and
provide all-season access. The construction o f the RGE i s scheduled to commence in October
2006, although some site access roads may be built earlier, and i s expected to be completed in
2009; the LRIP road construction will commence in April 2006 (Phase I), Phase I1will be
                                                                             and
completed in2009.

InDecember 2004 the Communications Design Institute of Jiangxi Province (CDIJP) engaged
the Research Institute o f Highways (RIOH) of the Ministry of Communications to undertake the
preparation o f the environmental impact assessment for the RGE project and they completed the
Environmental Assessment (EA). The Terms o f Reference (TOR) for the EA were prepared in
December 2004. They were reviewed, revised and approved in early 2005 by the Bank. The
first draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report was prepared and submitted (in
Chinese) to the Bank in May 2005, followed by a second draft (EIA and Environmental
Management Plan-EMP-in           English) inSeptember 2005. The final revised draft reports (EIA,
EMP and EA summary), incorporating a late five km change in the alignment to accommodate
the RuijinGranneng power plant and the comments bythe Bank were submitted to the Bank and
the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) in December 2005.              The reports were
approved by SEPA prior to negotiations.

The LRIP Phase IEA and EMP were prepared by the Nanchang-based Jiangxi Provincial
Environmental Protection Scientific Research Institute. The first draft was submitted for review
at the time o f the preappraisal mission. The Phase I1roads will have an EIA and EMP prepared
ina similar manner.

The project is classified as a Category A project since it involves major expressway construction
on new alignment, at-grade interconnecting roads to be upgraded on new alignments, increase in

disposal, community severance, soil erosion, resettlement, etc.

B.     Basisof the EA

The preparation o f the EA followed the regulatory and policy requirements for environmental
assessment o f development projects in China and the World Bank's Safeguard policies. O f the
ten Bank Safeguard policies applied to the project, the project triggered Environmental
Assessment (OP/BP/GP4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OD4.30). The Public Disclosure
(BP 17.50) policy also applies. The EA investigations did not find any protected areas or
cultural relics along the selected alignment or with the LRIP roads. Relevant international
environmental agreements inwhich China i s a signatory were also consulted where appropriate.

C.     BaselineEnvironment

The RGE alignment passes through the low-lying, rolling areas o f south-central Jiangxi
Province.    The topographic relief i s low in the east and high in the west, with hilly and
mountainous terrain, running generally in a northeast-southwest direction. The project area lies
inthe mid-subtropical, monsoon zone, with monsoon rains in summer and winter. The area is
characterized by four distinct seasons; mild climate, hot summers with high rainfall, short
extreme winters, and longnonfrost periods.

Field investigations along the RGE alignment identified about 57 villages/townships and nine
schools located about 30 to 150 m fiom the expressway center line. These will be vulnerable to
increased noise, dust, etc., due to construction activity. The expressway will also cross three
rivers but, fortunately, it will not pass through or near any nature reserves or protected areas or
disturb any cultural relic sites. The upgrading of the interconnecting roads impacts on one
administrative village and no schools. For the local roads, six townships and 20 villages will be
impacted. N o schools will be impacted.

Baseline air quality monitoring, conducted in MarcWApril 2005, showed average daily nitrogen
dioxide (NO$ concentrations between 0.006 and 0.013 milligrams/cubic meter (mg/m3),well
below the Class I1 Air Quality Standard o f 0.12 mg/m3. The average daily total suspended
particulate matter (TSP) concentrations varied between 0.03 to 0.06 mg/m3against 0.30 mg/m3
Class I1regulatory requirement. The results indicate good existing ambient air quality along the
expressway alignment. Only air quality monitoring will be conducted for the LRIP component
duringconstruction, and not duringoperation.

The day and nighttime noise monitoring results for 28 sensitive locations along the expressway
show that all villages meet Class I1[60 dB (A) day and 50 dB (A) night] requirements and some
villages can meet Class I[55 dB (A) day and 45 dB (A) night] requirements. Of the schools,
only the Yanba Primary School can meet the Class Irequirements. As a comparison, noise along
NR 323, whichparallelsthe expressway, exceeds Class I1criteria within 120mo fthe road.

The results o f the surface water quality monitoring o f rivers and reservoirs show that for all
monitored parameters (pH, oil, suspended solids and permanganate) the results were within their
respective Class I1standard.



                                                 68

The average soil erosion intensity along the main expressway area i s 1,640 tons/km2/year. The
allowable erosion intensity i s 500 tons/km2/year, requiring extensive erosion control during
construction and operation.

Archeological and Cultural Relic surveys, carried out during the alignment selection and
optimization (May and October 2005), covered the main alignment corridors, alternatives,
interchanges, interconnecting roads, borrow and disposal areas, etc., and did not identify any
threats to any archeological or cultural relics as a result o f the construction o f the Expressway.
The nearest identified relics (He Huanwen Tomb, Martyr Tomb, 1942) is a City-level relic about
350 m from the RGE alignment. N o cultural relics were identified inthe LRIP project area.

Neither the RGE nor BOT sections pass through or anywhere near natural habitats or protected
forests, All vegetation inthe area i s tertiary or younger. The same applies for the Phase ILRIP
roads.

D.      EnvironmentalImpacts

According to the modeling results, the soil erosion intensity during construction will reach about
1,706 tons/km2/year, and if no protection measures are taken during the construction period, the
total soil lost will be considerably higher than the "no project" scenario. The erosion will
continue during construction and the early part o f the operational phase, until such time as the
"greening" mitigation measures take effect. Soil erosion for the rural road construction i s also
expected to increase.

The project will permanently occupy 12,525 mu o f land including 55 percent o f forest and
woodland, and about 31 percent o f cultivated land. In addition, the project will occupy about
240 mu o f temporary land for 12 borrow pits. Twenty-four excess material disposal areas will
also be required, but these will be rehabilitated.          The construction o f the rural and
interconnectingroads will require additional land, but as most o f these roads are upgrading o f the
existingroads, any permanent occupation o f additional land will be limited.

During construction, farm crops, trees and other vegetation on the occupied farmland and
woodland will be lost to the project. However, the impact o f the loss o f vegetation cover will be
o f short duration as the slopes, interchanges, borrow pits, disposal sites and other temporarily
occupied areas will be landscaped and rehabilitated with grass, trees, shrubs, bushes and other
vegetation. The landscapingprogram i s expected to result in an increase inthe vegetation cover
along the Expressway.

The primary impact on the water environment during the construction phase includes discharge
o f sanitary sewage from the approximately 12 construction camps, and surface runoff from
bridge construction, storage areas, mixing plants, etc. The camps are expected to generate about
2-3 tons o f sanitary sewage per day, which will be treated using septic tanks to minimize the
impact on the receiving streams. All construction packages will include a typical design o f a
septic tank system. Bridge construction could result in the resuspension o f river sediments and
creates the risk o f oil contamination from leaks and spills. Solid wastes from camps, service
areas, storage areas, ifnot handled properly, could also create pollution problems.




                                                  69

Wastewater from the operational phase will include sanitary sewage from service stations and
parking lots, car-washing effluents and pavement runoff. Wastewater from point sources will be
treated to the applicable standards before discharge to the receiving streams. Surface runoff will
be smaller compared to the receiving river flows and its impact, based on modeling, i s expected
to be insignificant.

Traffic accidents on the bridges involving the transportation o f hazardous materials could result
in spills and pose a risk of water contamination.        Analysis o f accident data and prediction
indicate that there exists a slight probability o f water contamination from such accidents.
However, the consequence could be severe and the spills may impact water quality, aquatic life
and ecosystem, and health and safety o f the people livingdownstream o f the spills. The designs
will ensure that there is no direct discharge to water from structures.

Noise from multiple construction machines and equipment will not exceed the applicable
daytime noise standards at 55 m from the machinery, and will meet the nighttime standards at
about 250 m. Since there are only a few residents who live within 55 m from the construction
sites, the daytime noise impacts will be limited. Nighttime activities are not envisaged.

Modeling o f the noise levels inthe 55 villages and seven schools located near the RGE show that
all 62 locations would be subject to excess noise to differing degrees. During the construction
stage, seven locations (four schools and three villages) will experience higher noise levels.
Duringthe operational stage, inthe short term (2009), three schools and21 villages will exceed
the noise level by up to 15 dB (A). Inthe medium term, an additional 26 locations will require
protection as the noise levels increase with increases in traffic. For the rural road upgrading,
with lower but closer traffic, the noise levels will increase but are expected to fall between Class
I11and Class IV standards.

Fugitive dust from unpaved access roads, disposal areas, materials storage areas, crushers and
mixing plants, asphalt plants,materials transport, etc., will be the primary air contaminant during
the construction phase. Depending on the terrain and climatic conditions, the impact area can
range from 50 m from the source o f dust to 300 minthe case o f asphalt plants.

The "with and without" project scenarios predict an increase inN02,but lower carbon monoxide
(CO) and total hydrocarbons (THC) emissions during project operation due to increased vehicle
traffic and speed. Motor vehicle emissions and air modeling predicts NO2 concentrations below
the standards under normal weather conditions but exceeding the standards under unfavorable
weather conditions.

The expressway will be fully fenced with controlled access and will separate farmland and rural
communities from one another. To minimize the impact on the communities and farmers, 203
underpasses will be constructed for use by the local communities.

The expressway will improve accessibility to the project areas including a potential increase in
tourists. The nearest tourist attraction i s the Tongtianyan Grotto, located about 1.5 km from the
expressway.

E.      Analysis of Alternatives

The analysis and selection o f the alignment was carried out in four stages. Duringthe September
2004 feasibility stage, two broad corridors were compared and the South Line scheme was
selected based on fewer crossing o f the Gong River, NR 323 and the Ganlong Railway. The
selected alignment also met local government requirements. In stage two, within the preferred
corridor, two segments o f the alignment, namely, the Yudu and Jiangkou sections were further
refined.  O f the three comparative schemes in the Yudu section, Yudu Scheme I1was selected
based on the least land occupied and lowest resettlement, and associated lower disturbance and
impacts. The scheme also met with local government approval. Inthe Jiangkou section, Scheme
Iwasselectedbasedontheleastlandoccupation,leastresettlementandleastinterferencewith
the Ganlong Railway andNR 323.

During the preliminary design stages in September and October 2005, additional alignments
were compared as the design evolved and more geotechnical, cost, environmental and
resettlement information became available. After thorough analyses, some alternatives were
selected based o n lower environmental impacts (e.g. Scheme I1o f Yuyang-Hefeng section for
shorter tunnel length and fewer noise-sensitive locations; Scheme Io f the Gong River section for
lower impact on the river, etc.), some were selected based on lower resettlement and land
occupancy (e.g. Scheme I1 of Yudu Tunnel) and some selections involved tradeoffs between
lower construction costs and environmental impact against lower resettlement (Scheme I1 of
Sanmen). Inthe cases where alternative alignments were not viable, because o f the proximity to
towns or mining easements or railway, full consideration was given to mitigate adverse
environmental and resettlement impacts arising out o f the alignment. This was the case for
Section K31-K33.5 where the alignment passes through a flood-prone area. Since the alignment
could not be shifted and the construction o f the expressway embankment would have worsened
the flood levels and the duration o f the floods, the length o f the viaduct was increased to
minimize the increase in flood levels.

F.      Mitigation Measures

        DesignPhase

To control soil erosion, the design includes concrete and stone pitching on steep slopes,
interception ditches and landscaping. The stone pitching will have an immediate beneficial
effect on soil erosion. The borrow pits will be rehabilitated through the conversion o f the pits
into ponds or landscaping. Erosion from the construction waste disposal sites will be controlled
byconstructing retainingwalls and waste stockpiles will be coveredwith soil andlandscaped.

To control noise, the design includes measures such as noise barriers, soundproof windows, tree
planting, etc. to minimize noise impact on schools and villages. Twenty-nine noise barriers,
soundproof windows at 22 locations and six plantation belts (total cost o f Y 24.5 million) are
included in the mitigation measures. At other locations where the predicted noise levels are
below the applicable standards, noise monitoring will be undertaken and, ifnecessary, mitigation
measures will beimplementedto control noise.




                                                71

The design also includes wastewater treatment facilities to treat contaminated water from service
areas, car-washing operations, repair shops, etc. Community severance i s mitigated through the
inclusion o f 203 underpasses, 43 grade separation bridges and numerous culverts and some
dedicated footbridges, capable o f accommodatingvehicular and pedestrian traffic.

        ConstructionPhase

The construction workspace will be minimized to reduce the impact o f land occupation. Areas
that must be occupied will be revegetated after completion o f the project. Workers will be
sensitized to protect trees and wild animals.       To minimize soil erosion in disturbed areas,
temporary protection measures, such as grass mats, will be applied in places where permanent
protection cannot be completed intime for the rainy season.

Large and noisy construction activities will be kept at least 50 m away from populated areas.
Operation o f noisy construction machinery and activities will be restricted to the daytime and
banned at night in sensitive areas. Seven noise barriers are planned to mitigate excessive noise
impact during construction. At other places, temporary noise barriers will be constructed to
protect the sensitive receptors from the impact o f the constructionnoise.

The project will use cofferdam in bridge construction to isolate work areas to minimize the
impact on surface water. Where possible, the construction will be scheduled duringthe low-flow
periods. Construction camps will be located to minimize disturbance to the nearby communities.
Solid wastes will be stored with proper protection and removed from the sites regularly by
qualified vendors for proper disposal. The camps will be maintained in sanitary, hygienic and
orderly conditions with good housekeeping to minimize health hazards to the workers and
adverse impacts to the surrounding environment. Sewage from the camps will be treated in
septic tanks to meet the irrigation discharge standards. All construction packages will include a
typical design o f a septic tank system.

To suppress airborne dust, unpaved access roads and Construction sites will be water sprayed at
least twice a day. Mixing stations and hot-mix plants will be located at least 300 m on the
leeward side o f the nearest village to minimize dust and smoke impacts. Trucks carrying dust-
generating materials, and materials stockpiles will be coveredwith canvas.

The EMP will be incorporated into the bid documents and its implementation will be a
contractual obligation. Training will be provided to all winning contractors and construction
supervision staff on environmental policies and regulations, potential impacts, mitigation
measures, daily monitoring andreporting, emergency handling, etc.

The LRIP component i s located in the remote hilly region o f Jiangxi and the construction o f the
roads will likely be carried out by local contractors who may lack proper managerial and trained
staff. Supervision i s expected to be weak and the environmental management o f the rural roads
construction may be poor. Therefore, the project provides for the local transport bureau and the
winning contractors to receive environmental management training by specialists from the JPCD
andlocal EnvironmentalProtection Bureaus (EPBs). The training will encompass environmental
protection during construction, noise and dust control, construction camp management, borrow




                                                72

pit and disposal site reclamation, construction safety and health, etc. The monitoring will be
carried out by the local EPBs.

        Operation Phase

To minimize the impact from noise, the EMP recommends that infuture, no new school, hospital
or other sensitive facilities should be built within 310 m from the central line o f the Expressway
or 30 to 50 m from the central line o f the interconnectingroads. Traffic management and motor
vehicle safety and emissions control will be enforced to minimize air and noise pollution.
Location and types of noise mitigation measures to be implemented are also included for the
mid-term period.

G.      EnvironmentalManagement Plan

A standalone Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was developed and includes applicable
environmental standards, environmental management system, mitigation measures and
monitoring plans for the construction and operation phases. The implementation o f the EMP
will be supervised by the Environmental Office o f the JPCD, the PMO, and the Jiangxi
Provincial High-class Highway Administration Bureau (JPHHAB), which will be responsible
for the Expressway operation. Inaddition, the local EPBs inthe project area will monitor it.

The EMP includes environmental monitoring programs for construction and operation phases.
The parameters to be monitored include noise, dust, water quality, etc. Duringthe construction
phase, environmental monitoring will be conducted on a daily and routine basis using mainly
visual observations and portable equipment such as hand-held noise meters, while periodic
monitoring will be carried out by accredited institutes using standard methods. Monitoring
reports will be compiled at regular intervals and submitted to the PMO, the relevant Provincial
agencies andthe World Bank. Duringthe operational phase, noise levels will bemonitored once
quarterly, while air and water quality will be monitored twice a year.           To ensure proper
environmental performance o f the project, the EMP emphasizes institutional building and
strengthening and includes detailed programs for training o f technical personnel from the
governments, project proponent and operational units, environmental institutions and the
contractors.

Environmental training for contractors and construction supervisors will be held prior to
commencement of construction. Each contractor and construction supervision unit will have
full-time, on-site, staff for environmental supervision on a daily basis. The training will cover
basic knowledge o f environmental protection and pollution control, the outcome o f the EIA and
requirements o f the EMP, environmental management and monitoring, reporting requirements
etc.   Training for the JPCD, PMO, the Expressway Administration, and environmental
institutions will cover       environmental management,       regulatory framework,       applicable
environmental standards, mitigation planning, environmental decision-making and pollution
control technologies.

The cost o f environmental management and mitigation measures i s estimated at about Y 44
million.

H.      PublicConsultationandInformationDisclosure

Two rounds o f public consultation were carried out during the preparation o f the EA: the first
round followed the preparation o f EA Terms of Reference (TOR) in MarcWApril 2005 and the
second round followed the preparation o f the draft EA reports in September 2005.                 The
consultations involved 646 households and individuals whose opinions were sought through
questionnaires, public meetings in villages and with local people's representatives, and
interviews with the affected groups and individuals.

Among the people surveyed, some 84 percent felt that the expressway and the interconnecting
roads were necessary and wished to see the construction start as soon as possible. On the
environment, 56 percent o f the people surveyed cited noise and 53 percent cited dust as the
major concerns during construction. Most o f the affected people (67 percent) would like to see
landscapingand tree plantingas measures to mitigate adverse impacts o f the project.

The main public concerns included adequate compensation for land acquisition, resettlement and
relocation, timely rehabilitation or restoration o f damaged irrigation systems, construction safety,
noise at schools, better access to and exits from the expressway, and sufficient numbers of
passageways to cross the expressway. For the rural roads, the public was also concerned about
roadblocks and access to services during the road upgrading, student safety, and convenient links
with and access to the expressway.

The project has responded to the public concerns by: (a) setting up land acquisition and
resettlement offices under the JPCD to implement the RAP; (b) developing plans for irrigation
system restoration; (c) providing for passageways and crossings for pedestrians and farm
vehicles at about every 600 m to mitigate community severance impacts; and (d) providing for
noise barriers, noise insulation windows and tree plantingto minimize the impacts o f noise from
the Expressway and interconnectingroads.

In compliance with the EIA process requirements of the government of China and the World
Bank, the draft EIA and EMP reports (RGE, BOT and LRIP) and parts o f the public consultation
records were disclosed inpublic places inlibraries and social centers along the project corridor.
The project information and availability o f the reports were advertised inthe Gannan Daily, the
province-wide newspaper. The public consultation and information disclosure are summarized
in the tables below. Additional disclosures were carried out in December 2005 and January
2006.

I. BOTSection

The BOT section connecting the east end o f the RGE to the Fujianborder i s considered link d to
the RGE. The EA and EMP for the BOT section are consistent with those o f the RGE. The EA
and EMP were disclosed. The contract with the concessionaire states that: "This project (A
section) [i.e. the Boa will link with the WB financed RGE, therefore the principles and
procedures o f EIA and EMP o f A section will be the same as that o f B section [i.e. the RGE].
The environment will be monitored during construction phase and operation phase and reported
to the Bank periodically." The JPCD will therefore ensure that appropriate supervision and
monitoring i s conducted throughout the construction phase. The BOT monitoring results will be
included in the environmental reports submitted to the Bank covering the RGE. The Bank's
missions will supervise the BOT environment at the same time as the RGE supervision.

11.      SOCIAL SAFEGUARDISSUES

A.      ResettlementPlanning

The Project Resettlement Office (PRO) contracted CDIJP and Resettlement Research Center o f
Wuhan University to assist in the planning process. The census, inventory and socioeconomic
surveys were conducted on the expressway and local roads in May 2005 and two more
supplementary surveys in July and November 2005.               The Anthropology Department of
Zhongshan University conducted a social impact assessment for the project in M a y 2005 to
assess the social impact o f the entire project.

The resettlement planning activities provided a detailed record of project adverse impacts,
including land, housing, enterprises, schools and the number of people affected.                    The
socioeconomic survey and ,social impact assessment were conducted through questionnaires,
interviews and focus group discussions. They provided a baseline socioeconomic living standard
and facilitated the consultation process with key stakeholders in the resettlement planning
process. Their feedback was incorporated inthe development o fthe RAP.

The RAP contains three components: (a) the RGE; (b) the LRIP; and (c) the BOT section, which
i s considered linked to the project.

B.       ProjectImpacts

The RGE and LRIP impacts are summarized inTable A10.4.

The impact analysis indicates that, given the linear nature o f the project and the efforts at
selecting the optimum alignment, the project impacts are quite scattered along the roads. Among
the 66 affected villages along the expressway, only two villages will lose more than ten percent
o f their farmland, and 31 villages will lose less than five percent o f their farmland. All the 20
villages along the local roads will lose less than five percent o f their farmland. Inconclusion, the
loss o f farmland along the expressway i s 4.85 percent, while the farmland loss o f the local roads
i s 4.12 percent. The socioeconomic survey indicates that the income structures o f the affected
farmers are quite diverse and on-farm income i s only one o f their many sources o f income, so the
project will not undulyimpact on the farmers.

C.       LegalFramework

The RAP was prepared in line with relevant Chinese laws, regulations and World Bank
Operational Policy 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement. The most important laws and regulations
include:

0    Details for Implementation o f the "Land Administrative Law o f the PRC" in Jiangxi
     Province

Taking into consideration the Bank's policy on resettlement, the following principles were
adopted for resettlement planning and implementation:

0    compensation will be paid at replacement cost without depreciation;
0    landcompensation will bepaid before acquisition;
0    house compensation will be paid before construction o f the new houses;
0    relocation will be started after completion o fthe new houses;
0    compensation rates must be finalized through consultation;
0    lack o f legal title will not bar a displaced person from his or her entitlements; and
0    the objective o f resettlement i s to enable the displaced people to improve or at least restore
     their living standards.




                                                        76

D.       Rehabilitation Strategy and Action Plan

With the development o f a market economy in the country, more opportunities are opening for
the rural population. Through intensive consultation with the affected farmers, those who lose
less than ten percent o ftheir total farmland prefer to receive landcompensation incash and make
use o f the money to generate further cash income from secondary and tertiary industries.
Farmers inthe two villages whose land losses will be more than ten percent will firstly receive a
piece o f land through land redistribution in the village, and then use the land compensation
collectively for construction o f a village road, paying part of medical insurance, participation in
technical training, completion o f the irrigation systems for orange orchards or increase o f the
irrigated land, and opening o fnew cultivated land, etc.

About 1,541 households will have to move for construction o f the expressway, among which
ninevillages will havemore than 50 households to be relocated. Deductingthe households who
do not need to rebuild and do not want to move collectively into the residential area, 28 to 48
households in each village will resettle into newly built residential areas, ranging from nine to 18
households in each village group. The residential areas will be built inthe same villages o f the
relocatees. The costs for landleveling o f the house plots, water andpower supply, road access in
the new area will be paid from the resettlement budget. All the affected households will move
out o f the old houses after completion o fthe new ones.

Five enterprises are partly affected.        Production will be restored shortly with the cash
compensation. One primary school will be rebuilt inthe same village and the relocation will be
undertaken duringthe school vacation.

E.       Management Organization

A multilevel organization was established for implementation o f the RAP. This organization
includes the Resettlement Offices at the province level, Ganzhou City, the five county/city/
districts, and the levels below. All the offices have been established, staffed and equipped. An
independent monitor, the Resettlement Research Center o f Wuhan University, was selected to
monitor the resettlement implementation. The RAP contains a detailed staffing list and their
detailed responsibilities. A training program i s also proposed for the resettlement staff.

F.       Public Consultation and Participation

Public consultation and participation have played a key role in formulating the RAP. The
affected farmers, village leaders and local governments participated in the census and inventory
andthey were widely consulted through the socioeconomic survey and social impact assessment
on the project alignment to discuss compensation rates, livelihood rehabilitation strategy and
relocation sites. Their feedback was incorporated inthe RAP.

Public consultations and participation will continue during the RAP implementation. Affected
farmers will play a key role in determining the usage o f land compensation funds and the
selection o f relocation sites. Project information will be provided to the affected farmers through
television, radio broadcast, newspapers, bulletins and posters. The RAP will be summarized into
a resettlement information booklet (RIB) and distributed to every affected household prior to the
project commencing.        It will include the detailed status o f the affected households, the


                                                  77

resettlement policy and compensation rates applied in the project, the project implementation
progress, the procedures for complaint resolution and any other materials that may be
appropriate. A sample RIB i s in the RAP and the final RIB will be reviewed by the Bank prior
to distribution.

Regular consultationmeetings will be held inthe villages. The RAP was available for review in
the PMOS and the local libraries o f all counties/cities/districts in November 2005.        The
availability o f these reports was advertised in the Gannan Daily on November 20, 2005. The
RAP was placed inthe Bank InfoShop inDecember 2005.

G.      GrievanceRedressMechanism

A mechanism was designed for grievance redress under the project. All grievances can be filed
inbothwritten andverbal form. Theredress channel lies within the project management systems
at village, township, county, city and project resettlement offices. Recording requirements and
timefi-ames were established for grievance resolution. This mechanism will be disclosed as part
o f the RIB.

H.      ResettlementImplementationMonitoring

Internal and external monitoring was designed as part o f the project. The PROs will carry out
internal monitoring o f the resettlement implementation. The monitoring procedures, content,
staffing, responsibility, timeframe and reporting are detailed in the RAP. An external monitor
was contracted for independent monitoring o f the RAP implementation. A monitoring guideline
was developed and attached to the RAP. Independent monitoring will cover physical progress o f
the RAP implementation, including compensation payment, allocation o f residential sites,
rehabilitation activities and restoration o f infiastructure. The independent monitor will also
review the public consultation process, operation of the PROs, grievance redress mechanisms
and restoration o f livelihood for the affected farmers. Independent monitoring will be conducted
twice a year duringthe project implementation period.

I. CompensationandResettlementBudget

The RAP contains compensation rates for various impacts. Land compensation rates include
land compensation and resettlement subsidy. Different rates were developed for different types
o f land in line with the "Land Administration Law."       The RAP contains detailed calculation
tables and the different compensation rates for structures. Unit rate analysis was conducted for
the replacement cost o f different types o f houses.      The compensation budget was finalized
through negotiation with the affected persons or units and with the management agencies
concerned.

The RAP contains a detailed resettlement budget that covers all basic resettlement costs,
management costs, contingencies and taxes. The basic resettlement cost includes compensation
for land, houses, other structures, standing crops and trees, the cost o f land leveling and
infrastructure development at new sites, reconstruction of affected infrastructure and relocation
subsidies. Management costs, including independent monitoring, are included inthe budget as
well. A total contingency o ften percent i s provided inthe budget. The total resettlement budget



                                                  78

i s estimated as Y 259.54 million, four percent o f the total project cost for the expressway. Fund
disbursement procedures and monitoring mechanism are designed and documented inthe RAP.

J.      Linkage

The construction o f the 3 1km BOT expressway fiom the Fujianborder at Ailing to Ruijinat the
east end o f the RGE will be started mid-2006 by a HongKong Company. The preparation team
determined that this BOT section i s linked to the RGE component o f the project, which means
that the Bank's safeguard policies will be applied. This i s embodied in the contract with the
concessionaire, which states: "Since this project (A section) [i.e. the BOT] will link with the
World Bank financed Ruijin-Ganzhou Expressway, the principles, procedures and compensation
rates o f resettlement will be the same as that o f the B section [ i e . the RGE]. The resettlement
activities will be monitoredboth internally and externally and reportedto the Bank periodically."

For the construction o f the BOT, 3,061 mu o f landwill be expropriated and 47,511 m2o f houses
will be demolished. The RuijinCity Government will execute the resettlement implementation
with the same compensation policies and rehabilitation strategies as those set forth in the RAP
for the RGE. The same monitoring system, internal and external, will apply. An abbreviated
Resettlement Plan was prepared and attached to the project RAP as Annex 2.

The legal agreement for the project contains a covenant obliging JPCD to implement the EA,
EMP and RAP for the BOT section.

The Huangjin Interchange at the west end of the RGE was put into operation in 2004. All the
resettlement activities were completed satisfactorily in August 2003. The resettlement policies
and compensation rates were consistent with those set forth inthe World Bank-financed Second
Jiangxi Highway Project RAP. No issues remain.

K.      Resettlement Policy Framework

Two roads were selected for Phase Iof the LRIP component. Their resettlement i s included in
the project RAP. InPhase I1additional roads will be selected. For this purpose, a Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared by the JPCD and submitted to the Bank in November
2005. An Abbreviated Resettlement Planwill be requiredwith the Phase I1roads.

L.      Indigenous Peoples

Jiangxi Province has 112,800 ethnic minorities, constituting 0.27 percent of the total population.

A census survey was undertaken with the social impact assessment (SIA) by the Anthropology
Department o f Zhongshan University in M a y 2005. The total population in the project area i s
about three million, among which 15,770 are ethnic minorities o f She, Miao, Tibetan, Zhuang,
Man,Hui,Tong, (0.5 percent ofthe total population).

The ethnic minorities are scattered inthe urbanareas, and concentrated inthree o f the 63 villages
or six o f the 211 village groups inthe rural areas. Inthe six village groups, more than 30 percent
o f the people are ethnic minorities and most o f them are She. The She people used to be Han
until 1987 when they were informed that if their forefathers were She, they could also be She.


                                                 79

The Yao were moved by the government from GuangdongProvince inthe 1950s. They live ina
village in Quannan County, about 300 km from the RGE project area. All the ethnic minorities
were harmonized with the Han. The She do not have a different language from the Han.

On the basis o f the SIA and due to the levels o f integration and lack o f distinctive culture, no
Indigenous Peoples Action Plani s required.

M.      SocialImpact Assessment

The RGE SIA focused on social impacts o f the project on the communities in the project area
and on consultation with the various stakeholders for improvement o f the project design.
Particular attention was paid to vulnerable groups, such as the poor, sick, disabled and children
with parents working out o ftown.

The SIA showed that the project would benefit local people and promote the local economy.
Ganzhou City Prefecture i s a poor area in Jiangxi Province, and the income o f the rural
population inthe project area i s about 50 percent lower than the average income o f Ganzhou City
Prefecture. The SIA showed that people are poor due to a low level o f education, to poor health
andto their traditional closed societies. It was for this reason-improving   the economic level o f
poor communities-that     the LRIP selection criteria included the "expected positive impact o f the
project on population access to education, health and other production and/or commercialization
o f local products."

The SIA confirmed that this project would improve the transportation conditions and improve
the local economy. In particular, it would be helpful for children to be cared for while their
parents are working out of town.        It reflects the major concerns of the villagers for land
acquisition, relocation, road construction and road safety. The SIA was sent to the design
institutes, P M O and PRO.      Comments and suggestions on resettlement issues were well
incorporatedduringthe process o f RAP preparation.

An SIA was done for the Phase ILRIP roads. For the Phase I1roads, a census survey o f
displaced persons and valuation o f assets will be undertaken for an Abbreviated Resettlement
Plan; or a socioeconomic study and baseline census will be undertaken for a Resettlement Plan.
These are described inparagraphs 8 and 9 o fthe LRIP RPF.
