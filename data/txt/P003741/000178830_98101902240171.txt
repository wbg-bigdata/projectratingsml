INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR THE SIXTH IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$65 million to
help finance the Sixth Irrigation Project. The loan would have a term of
30 years, including six years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on Indonesia "The Indonesian Economy:
Recent Developments and Prospects for 1974/75", of November 26, 1973 (R73-
273) described and analyzed the substantial changes which had taken place
in the Indonesian economy in 1973. Since then there have been important
further developments, especially in oil prices. A basic economic mission
has completed field work for a report to reassess Indonesia's development
prospects and policies. Country data are shown in Annex I.
3.        The Indonesian economy, which was dualistic and export-oriented
in the colonial period, was severely affected by the great depression in
the 'thirties, and the war, followed by the struggle for independence in the
'forties. After a relatively brief period of recovery in the early 'fifties,
the economy stagnated again in the decade 1957-1967 largely as a result of
poor economic policies. Thus, after a long period of economic difficulties,
in which the population nearly doubled, Indonesia had become one of the
poorest countries in the world.
4.        The Suharto Government introduced an effective stabilization
program to combat the economic disruption and spiralling inflation of the
mid-1960's, and there was a period of recovery and rehabilitation under the
First Five Year Plan. Real annual economic growth was about 7 percent in
the period 1968-1973. Domestic savings and investments increased con-
siderably, thus providing the basis for continued economic expansion after
the rehabilitation phase. By 1973, investments, excluding those in the oil
sector, which were very substantial, had grown to an estimated 19 percent
of GNP, of which about three quarters were financed from domestic sources.
Sustained efforts were made to increase food production, with emphasis on
rice. Although a drought in the second half of 1972 led to a setback in
food production and a steep increase in prices, production has recovered
since then. On average rice production increased by 4 percent per annum
between 1968 and 1973. Efforts to expand food production continue to
receive high priority and in this connection the Government increased fer-
tilizer imports in 1974 to a level of about US$435 million equivalent. Ex-
pansion of domestic fertilizer capacity is being pursued actively.



-2 -
5.         Even before the increase in petroleum prices in late 1973, the
money economy was booming, and real growth was accelerating under the
influence of steep increases in Indonesia's other export prices, a sig-
nificant physical expansion of production in the oil and forestry sectors,
a rapid growth in direct investment (initially in petroleum exploration
and production and in forestry and mining, but increasingly in manufactur-
ing), and a large inflow of short term credit. The same factors, however,
also contributed to significant inflation, which reached a rate of nearly
50 percent during the fiscal year 1973/74. The Government took a number
of measures to combat the inflation in April 1974. These included measures
to restrict credit and continued augmentation by import of supplies of rice
and fertilizers, sold domestically at subsidized prices. Since then, the
rate of inflation has declined to about 18 percent on an annual basis. More
recently, the Government has somewhat relaxed the monetary restrictions.
6.         The contribution of the oil sector to the economy, which was al-
ready increasing rapidly, has taken a quantum jump since September 1973.
The Indonesian oil price, which was $3.73 per barrel in that month, reached
$12.60 per barrel in July 1974. In addition, early in 1974, Indonesia
renegotiated the contracts with the foreign oil companies to receive a
larger share of the total oil proceeds. Thus, while the net oil contribu-
tions to the balance of payments and the Government's revenues were below
$0.5 billion in 1972/73 (less than 5 percent of the GNP), they are expected
to reach well over $3 billion in 1974/75, an increase of about $20 per
capita. Given also the external and domestic inflation, both exports and
budgetary receipts will probably exceed $5 billion in 1974/75, a rough
quadrupling in two years. This rapid growth of export receipts is unlikely
to continue, however, as the prices of Indonesia's major non-oil exports,
particularly timber and rubber, have recently declined rather sharply, and
the volume of exports is likely to rise at a much slower rate in the future.
7.        At the same timLe, the inflation continues to affect the expendi-
ture side of the balance of payments, and the budget. Average Indonesian
import prices are estimated to have increased by 80 percent between 1972
and 1974, with the largest increases occuring in the prices of foodstuffs
and agricultural inputs (rice, wheat, sugar, fertilizer). Thus, more than
one-half of the additional oil earnings will have to be used to pay for the
price-induced additional cost of imports. Moreover, to shield the domestic
consumer against the effect of high external prices, the Government has been
subsidizing the sale of certain essential imported goods (mostly rice and
fertilizer) at an annual cost equivalent to nearly $1 billion. While the
international price of these products may decline somewhat in the coming
years, the high prices of manufactured goods, which account for some two-
thirds of the commercial imports, are likely to continue to increase, thus
permanently reducing the real value of the balance of payments surplus. The



overall surplus on the balance of payments in 1974/75 is expected to be about
$850 million and, as a result, foreign exchange reserves may increase from
$900 million on March 31, 1974 to almost double that level by the end of
March 1975 (equivalent to about four months of imports at the then expected
rate).
8.        Domestically, the Government now has to pay more for goods and
services (including Government salaries). Thus, as in the case of the
export earnings, more than half of the additional budgetary receipts is
expected to be eroded by the effects of inflation. The remainder will
largely be spent on real increases in Government outlays, including much-
needed gradual salary increases, development expenditures, routine expendi-
tures, and grants in support of the budgets of the local governments.
Thus, the overall budgetary surplus in 1974/75 will probably be well below
$500 million. The Government has recently submitted to Parliament the
1975/76 budget which, as in previous years, is in overall balance after
taking into account expected receipts from foreign assistance, equal to
about US$575 million equivalent.
9.        The Second Five-Year Plan (1974/75-1978/79) provides significant
new directions for Indonesia's development policy by emphasizing its social,
regional, employment and equity aspects. It is recognized that, while the
Government's initial economic stabilization and rehabilitation programs,
as well as a number of other specific activities, have benefitted large
segments of the population, the benefits of investments in industry - much
of it in or around Jakarta - have not been widely spread. Also, the con-
tinued high level of agricultural prices after the 1972 crop failure has
benefitted the rural areas but has severely reduced the real income of the
urban poor. The Government's policy to keep the consumer prices of basic
commodities in check through subsidies is providing relief, but it is the
intention to work out and implement gradually a number of more basic so-
cially oriented policies and programs in the fields of employment, educa-
tion, housing, etc.
10.       In the short and medium run, Indonesia will need continued inter-
national technical assistance for project planning, preparation and imple-
mentation. In view of the rising prices of the country's imports and
pressing development needs, Indonesia's earnings from oil and other ex-
ports, which are likely to grow at a slower rate in the future, will not
be sufficient to finance the development programs necessary to deal effec-
tively with its major problems of poverty, overpopulation and unemployment.
Indonesia will therefore continue to need, and should be able to use effec-
tively, financial and technical assistance from abroad on a large scale if
the Government is to be able to implement programs to accelerate its economic
growth and to alleviate widespread poverty. This poverty underlies the strong
case for continued international assistance to Indonesia, even though oil
payments may help the country earn relatively modest budgetary and balance
of payments surpluses for a limited period.



-4-
11.       The soft average terms of foreign assistance provided in the con-
text of the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI), and the resched-
uling of pre-1966 external debt obligations (under the 1970 Paris Club
Agreement with the Western countries, and Japan, and parallel arrangements
with several East Europeart countries) have kept Indonesia's public debt
service ratio low. Service payments on rescheduled public debt and that
subsequently incurred up to the end of 1973 are estimated at $344 million
in 1974, will reach a peak of $371 million in 1975, and are projected to
decrease gradually thereafter. Comparing these amounts with the projected
export level of $5 billion in 1974/75, it appears that Indonesia now has
the capacity to service significant additional debt. However, in view of
the country's continuing need for large amounts of external capital, it is
important that the average terms of foreign borrowing remain moderate so
that Indonesia's ability to service its external debt is not unduly strained.
Since no further quantum jump in Indonesia's exports is anticipated at pres-
ent, the debt service payments on the accumulating debt, and the debt serv-
ice ratio, could rise quickly if those who provide aid and the Government
do not continue to give close attention to the terms of new foreign borrow-
ings.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
12.       As indicated in Part I, Indonesia will continue to need substan-
tial external financial and technical assistance to rehabilitate and improve
infrastructure and to expand production capabilities and employment oppor-
tunities in agriculture, minerals, forestry and manufacturing. With the
continued growth of the economy, the Government will also be able to devote
increasing attention to ensuring that the benefits of development are dis-
tributed widely. Programs to increase the productivity of smallholder
farmers and to resettle farmers from Java on presently unutilized areas in
the outer islands, the expansion of labor-intensive industry in Java, the
development of new industrial activities in Java and the outer islands,
family planning, water supply, education, health and other social programs
will therefore have an important place in the development strategy during
the period of the Second Plan. The work of both the Bank's headquarters
and Resident Staff has been oriented toward these objectives.
13.       As of February 28, 1975, Indonesia has received 37 IDA credits
amounting to $561.8 million and five Bank loans amounting to $252.5 mil-
lion. Future financial assistance from the Bank Group to Indonesia is
expected to be in the form of Bank loans and IFC investments. The Bank Group
accounts for less than 4 percent of Indonesia's total outstanding public debt
at the end of 1973. By 1978 it is expected to account for less than 11 per-
cent of total outstanding debt and less than 5 percent of Indonesia's annual
debt service obligations. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of February 28, 1975, and notes
on the execution of ongoing, projects.



-5-
14.       In accordance with the priorities of Indonesia's Five-Year
Plans, about one-third of Bank Group lending to date has been for agricul-
ture. IDA has extended four credits to help rehabilitate Government agri-
cultural estates, producing principally rubber, oil palm and tea, five
to assist rehabilitation and expansion of irrigation systems serving
millions of smallholders on Java, two for fisheries and one each for
improved seeds multiplication, beef cattle development, smallholder rubber
development, sugar industry rehabilitation and smallholder tea development.
Industry is of growing importance to the Indonesian economy and the Bank
Group has assisted in six projects in this sector: two to expand PUSRI's
fertilizer production capacity, two for BAPINDO and one for the Private
Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI) to help these development
finance companies expand their industrial lending and one for Indonesia's
first industrial estate project. Other sectors to which loans and credits
have been extended are power, transportation, telecommunications, education,
population, urban housing improvement and water supply. In addition, four
credits have been made to assist the Government in preparing and formulating
appropriate development programs and projects.
15.       The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in 1968, and almost
half of all loans and credits have been made since June 1972. Bank lending
to Indonesia began only in June 1974. The program has increased rapidly
from a relatively small base, and consequently the undisbursed portion of
loans and credits is substantial. Moreover, several credits have financed
projects planned for execution over extended periods. Many, in addition,
have been associated with institutional reforms involving, inter alia, the
creation and reorganization of program and project authorities, drafting of
new charters and the enactment of new legislation, all of which has taken
time. Thus, a number of projects have experienced delays in the initial
stages of implementation, and some are inherently slow disbursing. However,
the performance of most project agencies has improved continuously as or-
ganizational improvements have begun to take effect and Indonesian staff
have become more experienced in project execution. Despite the improved
administrative capabilities, most development projects, including those
financed by the Bank Group, have been adversely affected by cumbersome
budgetary, procurement and customs clearance procedures. The Indonesian
authorities recognize the need to streamline procedures and are consider-
ing steps necessary to accomplish this. As a first step, the Government
has requested and we have arranged for assistance under the Fourth Tech-
nical Assistance Credit (Credit 451-IND) to establish an effective control
system in the National Development Planning Board (BAPPENAS) to monitor the
progress of development projects. Additional measures to improve project
administration are now under consideration by the Government.
16.       The future Bank lending program will continue to support the
Government's efforts to speed up economic growth and to ensure that the
benefits of development are distributed widely. Specifically, it will
give high priority to agriculture, concentrating on broad programs of
support to increase production of rice on the inner islands and to expand



- 6 -
resettlement and agricultural production on the less populated outer islands.
Emphasis will also be given to socially-oriented projects in the fields of
population and nutrition, education and urban development. The Bank program
will also continue to provide support for the Government in developing the
additional industrial capacity and infrastructure which are essential to
economic growth. Projects in agricultural research, fertilizer distribution,
power, and natural resource surveying and mapping are being prepared and may
be ready to present to the Executive Directors during this fiscal year.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
17.       Agriculture is the mainstay of the Indonesia economy, accounting
for 50 percent of GNP, 60 percent of total employment and almost all of
non-oil exports. The major food crops are rice, maize, cassava, sweet
potatoes, soybeans and groundnuts, and they provide 85 percent of the
total calorie and 80 percent of the total protein intake of the population.
Rice accounts for nearly one-third of the total value of agricultural pro-
duction and 12 percent of GNP.
18.       During the First Five Year Plan (1968/69-1973/74), the first
priority was given to increasing agricultural production, particularly of
rice, the staple food, through rehabilitation of the existing irrigation
systems, price support and supply of modern inputs. During this plan
period, agriculture grew at nearly 4 percent per annum. Rice output was
severely affected by drought in 1972, but crops were satisfactory in 1973
and 1974. The production of milled rice rose from 10.8 million tons in
1968 to 13.4 million tons in 1973, a total increase of 2.6 million tons,
or an average annual increase of about 5 percent. Rice production in 1974
is estimated to be 15 million tons. However, due to population growth during
the same period, this represented an annual increase of only 2.4 percent
per capita in the supply of domestically-produced rice. In order to meet
the increasing demand for rice, the Government has imported 0.5-1.5 million
tons of rice per year over the last five years.
19.       With limited opportunities for increasing rice production under
rainfed conditions in Java, the Government must intensify its program of
irrigation development if it is to reach its objective of achieving self-
sufficiency in rice. The Secor.d Five Year Plan (1975/76-1979/80), therefore,
gives priority to the completion of the on-going irrigation rehabilitation
projects, some further rehabilitation, groundwater development, and construc-
tion of new storage dams to increase cropping intensity in already irrigated
areas and to serve new areas. About 25 such projects are included in the Sec-
ond Five Year Plan; when completed in 1981 these would provide irrigation to
240,000 ha. In addition, the Second Plan includes a small-scale irrigation pro-
gram to upgrade and extend village irrigation systems to cover, mainly in the



- 7 -
Outer Islands, 550,000 ha by 1982. The Government has requested Bank Group
assistance for one irrigation project every year over the next three years.
A feasibility study for the Jatigede Dam in West Java was financed under
Credit 289-IND and preliminary works for this project are being carried out
with assistance from the Australian Government. Feasibility studies financed
under Credits 275 and 289-IND for the Pemali Comal storage dam in Central
Java and the Madiun Solo groundwater projects in East Java are expected
to be completed by the end of next year. This work may provide the basis
for future projects that could be financed by the Bank. The Government is
also seeking assistance from other international organizations and bilateral
sources to help finance projects in their irrigation program.
20.       The Government has also rapidly expanded the BIMAS program, which
provides extension services, improved seed, fertilizer, pesticides, and
credit. The program has generally been effective, but the number of trained
extension service staff and other personnel needs to be expanded to improve
the quality of assistance to farmers. The Government has agreed to strengthen
the program, particularly in the areas included in the proposed project.
21.       As is indicated in para 14, IDA has already financed five irriga-
tion projects (Credits 127, 195, 220, 289 and 514-IND), mainly for rehabili-
tation, wlhich will provide irrigation to about 850,000 ha. A Bank irrigation
program review mission visited Indonesia in March 1974 to review the progress
of these projects and concluded that physical progress, despite some delays,
was generally satisfactory. Production increases were substantially in
accordance with appraisal estimates and the economic rates of return on the
projects were satisfactory, despite considerable increases in costs. The
maission recommended, however, that increased attention be given in future
projects to programs of on-farm development, improved operation and main-
tenance, construction of tertiary and quaternary canals and agricultural
support services. The Government is considering providing the additional
funds under the Second Five Year Plan for these purposes. Moreover, the
Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension Project (Credit 514-IND), and the proposed
project include substantial provision for on-farm pilot development projects,
supporting agricultural services and construction of tertiary canals.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
22.       The project, which provides for the rehabilitation and improve-
ment of the Cirebon and Rentang irrigation systems in West Java and the
completion of the Sampean Baru system in East Java, was identified in
1971. Feasibility studies for the Cirebon and Sampean Baru components
were financed under Credit 289-IND (Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation Proj-
ect) and were prepared, respectively, by NEDECO/SMEC (Holland/Australia)
and llarza/Agro-Hydro Teknik (USA/Federal Republic of Germany). The feasi-
bility study for the work in the Rentang system was prepared by PROSIDA,



-8-
a unit in the Directorate General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD)
in the Ministry of Public Works and Power. The project was appraised in
June 1974 and negotiated in Washington from February 18 to 21, 1975. The
Government's delegation was led by Mr. Suyono Sosrodarsono, Director Gen-
eral of Water Resources Development, Ministry of Public Works and Power.
The appraisal report No. 595-IND, dated March 6, 1975, is being circulated
to the Executive Directors with this report and a project and loan summary
is contained in Annex III of this report.
Project Areas
23.       The Cirebon and Rentang sub-projects would rehabilitate and improve
two adjacent irrigation systems on the north coast of East Java, covering
89,000 ha and 92,000 ha, respectively. (Project locations are included in the
attached map). The rehabilitation of the irrigation network in the Rentang
area, begun in 1969 with Bank Group assistance under Credit 127-IND, has been
completed, but the drainage works and replacement of the old barrage were
not included in that project. The Sampean Baru irrigation system, in the
Sampean Baru sub-project area covering 9,800 ha in East Java, is surrounded
by the Pakalan-Sampean area which is being rehabilitated under Credit 289-IND.
The total population living in the project areas is about 4.5 million. About
365,000 farm families, or about 2.5 million people, would benefit directly
from the project. Pilot surveys show that the average farm size in the
project areas is 0.5 ha. Rice is the main crop and is grown throughout
the project areas in the wet season, and also during the dry season, wher-
ever there is sufficient water. Sugarcane, soybeans, corn and cotton are
also grown, mostly during the dry season.
Proiect Description
24.       In Cirebon, the project provides for the rehabilitation of
existing headworks and weirs; construction of primary, secondary, tertiary
and quaternary canal systems; improvement and construction of drains,and
related flood protection works; implementation of 20 pilot projects to
demonstrate the benefit of on-farm development; upgrading of existing
access roads and constructLon of inspection roads; and construction of
office buildings, stores and houses for project staff. In Rentang, the
project provides for the construction of a new barrage and irrigation in-
takes on the Cimanuk River; construction of tertiary and quaternary canals
and drains; improvement and construction of drains to serve a low-lying
coastal area of 30,000 ha; and construction of 20 pilot on-farm develop-
ment projects. In Sampean Baru, the project provides for remodeling of
the existing weir and intake structure; construction of an earth fill
closure dam on the Sampean River; rehabilitation and completion of the
primary canal and structures and construction of secondary, tertiary and
quaternary systems; construction of rural and inspection roads; the con-
struction of two pilot on-farm development projects; and a pump irrigation



- 9 -
demonstration scheme for upland crops. The project also provides for feasi-
bility studies for rehabilitation and improvement of the Madiun Irrigation
System covering 130,000 ha in Central Java and for construction of a new
feeder canal to provide dry season irrigation to about 30,000 ha in Cirebon;
detailed engineering of the irrigation and drainage networks in the North
Sadang Irrigation System (6,500 ha) in South Sulawesi; completion of on-
going groundwater investigations in the Madiun/Solo area; a soil conserva-
tion program in the Cimanuk River catchment area; construction of an agri-
cultural development center and 12 rural extension centers for expanding
the agricultural support programs and training farmers; and supply of nec-
essary vehicles and equipment for irrigation construction, operation and
maintenance and agricultural support services. In addition, the project
provides for agricultural support services in each of the three project
areas; training and technical assistance; preparation of maps for the
Madiun Irrigation Systems and for the development of the tertiary irriga-
tion networks in the areas included in previous IDA financed projects; and
establishment of a system for monitoring irrigation project benefits.
Organization and Management
25.       PROSIDA, which is presently implementing the projects financed
under Credits 127, 220 and 289-IND, would carry out the proposed project
and would appoint full-time managers to head field offices in each of the
three sub-project areas (Section 3.08 (c) of the Loan Agreement). PROSIDA
has gained significant experience in implementing three previous projects
financed by IDA and is now one of the most efficient units of DGWRD. The
project does, however, provide for the services of an internationally
recruited advisor to help PROSIDA in further strengthening its organization
and in improving provincial operation and maintenance. The project also
provides for the services of consultants and advisors to assist PROSIDA
to implement the project, prepare the feasibility studies includeid in the
project, advise on Rentang drainage and Cimanuk river problems ar,d assist
in the execution of a soil conservation program in the Cimanuk catchment
area. With this assistance, PROSIDA would be able to carry out effectively
its responsibilities under the project. In order to help overcome the
shortage of trained and experienced personnel, the project inclu4es substan-
tial provision for training PROSIDA, DGWRD and agricultural staff abroad
and in Indonesia in the fields of irrigation planning and design, water
management and operation and maintenance. The Government would submit a
detailed plan for the above training and that described in paragraph 27
within one year of the signing of the proposed loan (Section 3.11 of the
Loan Agreement).
26.       Construction of tertiary and quaternary canals, although tradi-
tionally the responsibility of farmers in Indonesia, has been slow under
previous IDA financed projects. For this reason, construction of tertiary
irrigation and drainage canals and related quaternary canals and control
structures have been included in the project. They would be designed by
PROSIDA which, together with local agencies, would guide and direct farmers
in constructing these canals. The Government would bear the cost of



- 10 -
engineering, materials and structures and construction and supervision of
the first 50m of each tertiary canal. Farmers in the project areas would
be organized by the village headmen, under PROSIDA's guidance, to complete
the canals. Should farmers fail to construct the tertiary and quaternary
canals within twelve months after PROSIDA has completed all of the engineering
work and the construction of the first 50m of the tertiary, the system would
be completed by the Government (Section 3.04 of the Loan Agreement) and costs
recovered through the PEDA tax (paragraph 36 below).
27.       The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) would have overall responsibility
for administering the agricultural support services, which are essential to
maximize the benefits of improved irrigation. The Director General of Agri-
culture would appoint a full-time Director in Jakarta and a project manager
in Cirebon, who would be responsible for coordinating the activities of all
Government agencies concerned and for providing the necessary extension
services and farmer training. An agriculture development center would be
established in Cirebon to collect agricultural data, expand agricultural
support services, and train farmers from the project areas and elsewhere in
Indonesia. The project also provides for twelve rural extension centers in
Cirebon and Rentang areas to train farmers in the project areas and forty
pilot areas to demonstrate on-farm irrigation development. Equip-ment, vehi-
cles and construction of the facilities necessary for this program are in-
cluded in the project. The Government would submit its detailed plan for
the agricultural development program to the Bank for its review and comments
within twelve months of the date of the Loan Agreement and implement this
program in accordance with the agreed schedule (Section 3.10 of .the Loan
Agreement). The project provides for the services of an internationally
recruited advisor to assist in the preparation of this plan and for train-
ing abroad and in Indonesia of MOA staff in the fields of agricultural
management, crop data collection, rice production techniques and organiza-
tion of local farmers.
28.       To ensure the adequate supply of other agricultural inputs, the
BIMAS package program providing production credit, fertilizers, pesticides,
extension and improved seeds would be expanded in the project areas. Under
this program, the Bank Rakyat Indonesia provides credit to farmers and MOA
provides extension and improved seeds. Fertilizer is made available through
Government and commercial retailers. MOA, PROSIDA, Provincial Government
irrigation engineers and farmers' groups would work together closely to
improve water distribution and management.
29.       MOA would be responsible for setting up and maintaining a system
for monitoring farm production and incomes on all Bank Group-financed irriga-
tion projects. This system would monitor production results and the social
distribution of benefits. The project provides for the services of a con-
sultant to assist MOA in the establishment of the monitoring system and for
the equipment and material required for such monitoring. MOA would submit
to the Bank, within six months of the signing of the Loan, a proposal for
monitoring these benefits (Section 3.12 of the Loan Agreement).

Project Cost and Financing
30.       The estimated total cost of the project is $165 million, of which
$65 million, or 40 percent would be in foreign exchange. The cost estimates
include allowances for physical contingencies of between 10 and 25 percent,
depending on the status of preparation and the type of construction. Price
contingencies are based on the expected rate of international and domestic
price increases. For civil works, the contingencies allow for a price in-
crease of 15 percent in 1975 and 12 percent per annum thereafter. For equip-
ment, the contingencies allow for a price increase of 11 percent in 1975 and
7.5 percent per annum thereafter. Total contingencies amount to $69.5 mil-
lion or 42 percent of total project cost.
31.       The proposed loan of US$65 million would finance the estimated
foreign exchange cost of the project. The Bank loan would have a repayment
term of 30 years, including six years of grace. The Government would pro-
vide the balance of project costs, equivalent to US$100 million, from its
own budgetary resources.
Procurement and Disbursement
32.       Vehicles, materials and equipment for irrigation construction and
operation and for agricultural services (estimated base cost $3.5 million)
would be procured after international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank Guidelines. For purposes of bid comparison, a margin of preference of
15 percent or the level of actual customs duties, whichever is less, would be
granted to qualified local manufacturers of these goods.  Small items of
less than $10,000 each, up to an aggregate limit of $100,000, which are not
suitable for international tendering, would be purchased through normal
Government procurement procedures which are satisfactory.
33.       The Rentang barrage (estimated base cost $13 million) would
be let as a single contract after international competitive bidding by
prequalified contractors. Qualified local contractors would be given
a preference of 7-1/2 percent in bid comparison. All other civil works
(total estimated base costs $54 million) would be small, widely scattered
and implemented sequentially over a six year period. As the contracts for
these works could not conveniently be combined into largeF bid packages
suitable for international competitive bidding, they would be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with
the Government's usual procurement procedures, which are satisfactory,
34.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed for 100 per-
cent of the cif cost of directly imported vehicles, materials and equipment;
95 percent of the ex-factory price of such items which are manufactured lo-
cally or 65 percent of the off-the-shelf price of such items which are im-
ported but procured locally. The proposed loan would also be disbursed for
50 percent of the total cost of civil works and socio-economic monitoring
services, 80 percent of the total cost of mapping services, and 100 percent
of the foreign exchange costs of consultant services and training.

operation and Maintenance and Recovery of Capital Cost
35.       Operation arnd maintenance of the irrigation systems and rural
roads is the responsibility of the Provincial Governments but, because of
inadequate funding, they have so far failed to establish satisfactory
organizations for this purpose. PROSIDA, with the assistance of the
management advisor included in the project, would be responsible for
operation and maintenance during the construction phase and would help
the Provinces build up adequate organizations to undertake this responsi-
bility after construction is completed. PROSIDA would prepare for Provin-
cial Governments an operation and maintenance manual and submit it to the
Bank within three years after the date of the Loan Agreement. The Govern-
ment would provide PROSIDA with adequate and timely funds to maintain all
project works during the construction period, and thereafter cause the
Provincial Governments to allocate sufficient funds to ensure proper
maintenance of all project irrigation works and rural roads (Section 4.03
of the Loan Agreement).
36.       Since June 1972, an interministerial committee has been studying
methods of collecting a portion of the increase in farm income from irriga-
tion development to cover operation and maintenance and a portion of the
investment costs.  The Committee's recommendation was that irrigation
charges should be collected by means of increases in the IPEDA tax, a land
tax based on the production of farmer's land. IPEDA is assessed at 5 per-
cent of net value of production of the land. This method of collecting
irrigation charges is the most appropriate and practicable in the Indonesian
context. The average annual IPEDA collection in the project areas is ex-
pected to rise from the present level of Rp 1,200 - 2,000/ha to Rp 6,000/ha
after the completion of the project in 1982. Since the cost of operation
and maintenance would be Rp 2,600/ha per annum after 1982, the reuenues col-
lected under the IPEDA tax would be sufficient to meet the full cqst of
operation and maintenance and to recover the capital c0st8 of the project,
excluding interest, over a period of 50 years.
Benefits and Justification
37.       The proposed project would increase paddy yields on about
200,000 ha by providing better water control, improved drainage and the
necessary agricultural support services. It would benefit about 365,000
families or about 2.5 million people. Total paddy production is expected to
increase from the present level of 500,000 tons per annum to 950,Q00 after
the completion of the project. The production of secondary crops would also
increase significantly. If the incremental cost of fertilizers and chemicals
are deducted, the net annual foreign exchange savings from the incremental
rice production alone would be about $50 million at full development.
38.       Assuming a 50-year project life, agricultural prices based on
the Bank's commodity price projections and seasonally variable shadow wage
rates for farm labor, the economic rates of return would be 38 percent for
the Cirebon, 44 percent for the Rentang and 18 percent for the Sampean Baru.



- 13 -
Alternatively, if a 30-year project life was used, the economic rates of
return would change only by about one percent. Sensitivity analyses indicate
that the rates of return in all cases remain satisfactory after taking into
account a range of possible adverse circumstances including delays in con-
struction, increase in construction and labor costs and reductions in project
benefits.
39.       As indicated in para 23, average farm size in the project areas
is about 0.5 ha, and farm incomes are extremely low. In Cirebon and Rentang,
farm incomes would more than double as a result of the project:
Farm Size (ha)         Annual Farm Income ($)
Present     Future
0.25                  72           160
0.5                  125           290
1.5                  320           740
However, even the few land owners who own farms of 1.0 to 1.5 ha would earn
at full development of the project per capita incomes of less than $110. The
majority of project beneficiaries would still be among the poorest 40 percent
of the population in Indonesia. The income of share-croppers, about 20
percent of farmers in these areas, would increase correspondingly, but at'
full development would still be only half of that of farmers who own their
land. Such farmers would have to continue to rely heavily on off-farm sources
of income. In the Sampean Baru area the increases in farm income would be
even more pronounced because of the very low incomes existing there at
present.
40.       All three project areas suffer from chronic unemployment and
underemployment. The project would improve the situation considerably by
creating the equivalent of some 45,000 additional full-time agricultural
jobs by 1985.
41.       Finally, the project would further strengthen the management of
PROSIDA and would introduce improved agriculture development services which
could serve as a prototype for development elsewhere in Indonesia. The
introduction of effective monitoring is also an important innovation, which
should help the Government obtain reliable economic and social data needed
to formulate more effective development strategies in the future.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Cr. No. 127    Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$5 Million Credit of
September 6, 1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This project includes the supply of earth-moving equipment and
machinery to rehabilitate three irrigation systems in Java and the con-
struction of a fourth in South Sumarta.  All the equipment supplied under
the credit is being well utilized and disbursements are 98 percent of
appraisal timetable. Completion of the project is expected to be delayed
in order to complete much needed additional drainage work, the financing
of which was not provided for under the credit. These additional costs
will be met by the Government.  The revised economic rate of return on the
project, which was calculated at 50 percent at appraisal, is now gxpected
to be about 25 percent. The closing date has been postponed to Dfcember 31,
1975.
Cr. No. 154    Highway:  US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This project included the rehabilitation of 3,000 km of high
priority roads in five provinces, procurement of maintenance equipment and
a substantial training program. Rehabilitation work was substantially
completed prior to the original closing date. However, it was neressary
to postpone the closing date by one year to December 31, 1975 to complete
procurement of a small amount of equipment and materials.
Cr. No. 155    Agricultural Estates:  US$16 Million Credit of
June 20, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This credit is for the rehabilitation of two Government owned
estate groups (PNP V & VII) in North Sumatra. With recent improvements
in management and much higher international prices the financial situation
of thie estate group is improving. The field and factory standards have
now been raised to a good technical level and the management has been
advised to concentrate on cost control in order to prepare for the time
when produce prices are less attractive than they are today. The combined
efforts of the management, consultants and IDA supervision missiops are
yielding good results.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projeets in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 165    Electricity Distribution:  US$15 Million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
See comment for Credit No. 334. The closing date has been post-
poned by 18 months to June 30, 1975.
Cr. No. 193    PUSRI Fertilizer:  US$35 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970 (as amended May 1973); Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
The urea plant has successfully passed its performance test and
is operating at close to rated capacity. The gas gathering and transmission
system is also completed and sufficient gas is being delivered to the
plant. Disbursements are expected to be completed by the closing date of
December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 194    Second Agricultural Estates:  US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
After initial delays, there have been considerable improvements
in management and these, combined with high prices for palm oil tnd rubber,
have resulted in a much stronger financial position, particularly for the
oil palm group (PNP VI). On the rubber group (PNP IV) more effort is
necessary to improve fertilizer application and tapping methods. With
the rapid expansion of investment on both estate groups, there is a need to
employ expertise in financial planning and management, which are now the
main constraints on efficient development.
Cr. No. 195    Second Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$18.5 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date: November 30, 1976
Problems of quality and progress of construction still exist,
but the consultants are tackling these vigorously, and the situation is
improving, although not sufficiently to make up for earlier delays. Costs
are likely to double the overall appraisal estimate, due to infl4tion, but
the Government will provide any additional funds required, Compl]etion of
disbursements will be about two years behind the original schedu.e. The
economic rate of return is however still more than 20%.
Cr. No. 210    Telecommunications Expansion:  US$12.8 Million Credit of
July 13, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Contracts for all equipment have been awarded. The closing date
has been postponed by 18 months due to delays in delivery of goods. The
Government has increased the tariffs to achieve the required rate of return
and a new charter for PERUMTEL has also been published.

Cr. No. 211    Fisheries:  US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project supplies funds for the construction of 30 fully
equipped skipjack boats and technical assistance. It is about 24 months
behind the original schedule due to delays in engaging the consultants
and in executing the contracts for the shore facilities. No further
delay is anticipated. There have been very substantial project cost
increases (from $4.3 million to $8.5 million). Because of the greatly
increased skipjack prices, however, the project is still expected to be
financially viable.
Cr. No. 219    Education:  US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Project implementation is generally satisfactory. Civil works
are progressing well and will be completed before the end of 1975. Con-
tracts for about 60 percent of the equipment have been awarded and deliver-
ies will take place before the technical training centers start operations
in 1975. The remaining equipment has been retendered because incomplete
bids were received. All equipment will be delivered by September, 1975.
Technical assistance is provided by Overseas Development Administration
(ODA) of the United Kingdom. Cost overruns on construction, furniture
and equipment and savings on technical assistance will probably Result in
a total cost overrun of about 30 percent above the appraisal estimate. The
Government will provide funds to meet this overrun.
Cr. No. 220    Third Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$14.5 Million Credit of
November 6, 1970; Closing Date:  December 31, 1975
This project includes rehabilitation and re-introduction of an
O&M organization in three irrigation systems, two in Java and one in South
Sulawesi. Construction remains about two to three years behind schedule
partly because of problems with preparation of contract documents and sub-
sequently due to inflation. These have now been mostly overcome. While
no further delays are expected, it is unlikely that the time losi could
be regained. There has been a considerable increase in overall project
costs, wihiclh is being met by the Government. The economic rate of return
for the project is still over 21 percent.
Cr. No. 246    Seeds:  US$7.5 Million Credit of May 14, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1977
Project implementation is behind schedule due to initial delays
in organization, management and procurement. The latest supervision
mission has reported that: development of the seed farm is hampered by the
slow execution of a contract to develop irrigation infrastructure and the
seed processing plant. lhe contract for irrigation infrastructure is being
renegotiated. The establishment of rice-seed research facilities at the



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 11 pages
project site is progressing slowly due to difficulties in recruiting
qualified local staff and delays in providing the required facilities and
the equipment. The seeds certification service is performing well and
development of the Klaten Seed District is progressing satisfactorily.
This project is being kept under frequent supervision.
Cr. No. 259    Tea:  US$15 Million Credit of June 14, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
This credit is for the rehabilitation of two groups of Government-
owned tea estates in West Java. Revised cost estimates for factory rehabili-
tation and expansion are substantially above appraisal estimates and project
consultants are reviewing them.
Cr. No. 260    Second Highway:  US$35 IMillion Credit of June 24, 1971;
CElosing Date: September 30, 1975
This project in Sumatra consists of construction of about 200 km
of highway, detailed engineering of further highway sections and a regional
development study. All construction work is now satisfactorily under way.
However, the delay caused initially by slow progress in mobilizing con-
tractors, difficulties in equipment delivery, heavy rains and land slides
will result in the project being completed about one year behind schedule.
Design standards for the road sections have been slightly lowered and some
savings will therefore be achieved. These and other savings are expected
to offset construction cost increases.
Cr. No. 275    Third Technical Assistance:  US$4.0 Million Credit of
December 29, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on this project is satisfactory. The closing date has
been postponed to complete disbursements for ongoing studies.
Cr. No. 288    Second Education:  US$6.3 Million Credit of
March 9, 1972; Closing Date:  December 31, 1976
Working drawings and furniture and equipment lists for all
project institutions have been completed. Physical facilities will be
completed and all project institutions will begin operations by the end of
1976. The government has agreed to provide additional funds to meet the
cost overruns (about 78 percent of the appraisal estimate) due to inflation.
Postponement of the closing date by about one year is likely to be required.

Page 7 of 11 pages
Cr. No. 289    Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$12.5 Million Credit
of March 9, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Civil works and equipment purchase for the main project, Pekalen-
Sampean, are proceeding but completion of civil works will be about two
years behind schedule. Due to inflation, project costs are likely to be
substantially higher than appraisal estimates. Consultants for the various
studies are at work with their counterparts. Groundwater investigations
have been delayed due to procurem,nt difficulties.  The rehabilitation and
storage feasibility studies are on schedule.  Disbursements are also on
schedule.
Cr. No. 300    Population:  IJS$13.2 Million Credit of April 20. 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Although progress is being made under this project, implementa-
tion continues to be hampered by management weaknesses. Lack of clear
administrative direction has resulted in overall delays in securing budgetary
funds and problems of program coordination. Procurement contract$ have
been let and civil works construction is underway.
Cr. No. 310    Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO I1):  US$10 tMillion Credit of
June 7, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
This credit is fully committed. Disbursements are expected to
rise rapidly.
Cr. No. 318    Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation:  US$8.5 Million Credit
of June 28. 1972; Closing Date: September 30. 1976
Progress on this project is satisfactory and disbursements are
expected to rise.
Cr. No. 319    Fourth Agricultural Estates:  US$11 Million Credit of
June 28. 1972; Closing Date:  June 30, 1981
This project includes the rehabilitation of a Government-owned
estate group in southern Sumatra. The physical progress of the project is
ahead of the appraisal schedule and the financial position of the estate
group is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 334    Second Electricity Distribution:  US$40 Million Credit of
September 29, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The Jakarta distribution program financed from Credits 165-IND
and 334-IND (together $55 million) has encountered substantial foreign
cost increases ($7.0 million) and implementation delays due to procurement
problems and cumbersome management procedures. Many of these difficulties
have been resolved but it is unlikely that the project can be completed
before mid-1978, two years behind the original schedule.

Cr. No. 355    Beef Cattle Development:  US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1980
Progress on this project for development of beef cattle production
in the outer islands has suffered from serious delays caused largely by
problems in securing Government funds and in clearance of documents by
Ii.donesian Government departments and consequent lack of essential equipment.
Land acquisition and procurement of cattle are proving more difficult than
expected, and there has been a substantial increase in total project costs.
The means of improving project performance are currently being discussed
with the Government.
Cr. No. 358    North Sumatra Smallholder Development:  US$5 Million Credit
of February 14, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This project has suffered from severe financial and organizational
difficulties due primarily to the lack of experience of project management,
the remote location of the project and inadequate Central Government support.
The Resident Staff has been following the project closely. Government has
taken a number of steps to overcome the problems and accelerate project
implementation. Project progress will continue to be closely monitored.
Cr. No. 387    Third Education:  US$13.5 Million Credit of
June 1, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Manuscript preparation and testing are on schedule and the first
year's staff training programs will be completed in sufficient time to
enable the mobile teacher training teams to start operation as planned.
Equipment procurement is now under way. Because of the sharp increase in
worldwide paper prices and shortage of supply, difficulty will be experienced
in obtaining sufficient paper under the Canadian loan included in the project
financing for the 1975 printing schedule. The Government has therefore
undertaken to release supplies from its stockpile. The expected cost overrun
arising from increased paper prices will be met by the Indonesian Govern-
ment. Project management is good and the team of technical assistance
specialists is operating effectively.
Cr. No. 388    Third Highways:_ US$14 Million Credit of June 1. 1973;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1977
This credit is for the construction of 124 km of highway and two
bridges in North Sulawesi and the study and detailed engineering of further
highways in Java. Construction bidding and consultant selection have been
proceeding on schedule. Some cost increases, due to inflation, are expected.

Cr. No. 399    West Java Thermal Power:  US$46 Million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Bids received in November 1974 for the first two 100 mw units at
Mfuara Karang were about 65 percent higher than estimated at the time of
appraisal. This, together with construction cost increases, has resulted
in an increase in the total project cost of more than 100 percent. The
Government will finance the additional cost.  PLN has satisfactorily met
the first year targets in its financial recovery plan provided for under
the terms of the credit agreement.
Cr. No. 400    Smallholder and Private Estate Tea:  US$7.8 Million Credit
of June 22, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1982
This credit is for the rehabilitation and replanting of smallholder
and private estate tea areas, and rehabilitation and construction of tea
factories in West and Central Java. The progress is generally satisfactory.
Cr. No. 405    Sugar Industry Rehabilitation:  US$50 Million Credit of
Jtine 26, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This credit is for rehabilitation of the Government-owned sugar
industry. Bids for equipment required for first phase major rehabilitation
have been received; a substantial cost overrun is expected, which the Cov-
ernment has agreed to finance. Some organizational problems are now being
resolved and disbursements are expected to rise.
Cr. No. 428    Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate:  US$16.5 Million Credit
of September 14, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Despite recent increase in construction costs, the project remains
financially viable because revenues from the sale of plots has risen propor-
tionately. Construction has fallen behind schedule due to land acquisition
problems, but developed land is being occupied as fast as it is made avail-
able. While there is still a backlog of applications for industrial plots,
tihe rate of new applications has fallen off during recent months and the
estate is intensifying its promotional efforts.
Cr. No. 436    Private D)evelopment Finance Company of Indonesia (?DFCI):
US$10 Million Credit of November 2, 1973; Closing Date:

Loan No. 1005  Railway:   US$48.0 Million Loan of June 4, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The procurement of material and equipment for the project, is
being organized by procurement agency engaged by the Railway. Proposals
for other technical assistance included in the project are currently being
evaluated. The Railway has proposed additional investments to meet a pro-
jected substantial increase in traffic during the next four years result-
ing from increases in the production of cement, fertilizers and coal. With-
out significant tariff increase the financial position of the Railway will
remain weak. This matter is being discussed with the Government.

ANNEX III
Page 4 of 4 pages
Procurement:   (a)  Vehicles, materials and equipment, costing about
$3.5 million would be procured after international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guide-
lines. For purposes of bid comparisons qualified
domestic manufacturers of these goods would be given a
margin of preference of 15 percent or the level
of actual customs duties, whichever is less. Small
off-the-shelf items of less than $10,000 each, up to
an aggregate limit of $100,000 would be purchased
through normal Government procurement procedures, which
are satisfactory to the Bank.
(b)  Civil works for the Rentang Barrage estimated at
$13 million would be awarded as a single contract
after international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group Guidelines. For the purpose of bid
comparison, qualified local contractors would be
accorded a margin of preference of 7-1/2 percent of
the contract value. The other civil works (total
estimated base cost $54 million) would be awarded
on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally
and in accordance with Government procedures, which
are satisfactory to the Bank.
Consultants:        The Government would engage an advisor to assist the
General Manager of PROSIDA; consultants to help carry
out the project, assist in the preparation of
feasibility studies and implementation of the local and
overseas training programs; an advisor to the Ministry
of Agriculture to help monitor project benefits; and
advisors to help prepare and develop soil conservation
and agricultural development programs and to solve
delta irrigation problems.
Economic Rate of
Return:             The economic rates of return would be 38 percent for
Cirebon, 44 percent for Rentang and 18 percent for
Sampean Baru.
