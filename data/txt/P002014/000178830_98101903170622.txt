INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOI2E3DATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR A TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $25.0 million to
the Federal Republic of Nigeria for a transport rehabilitation project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank/IDA has had 11 lending operations in Nigeria, beginning
in 1958.  Total lending amounts to $252.1 million, of which $99.6 million
has been for six transportation projects covering railways, ports and
highways.
3.        With the ending in early January 1970 of the civil war, the
Government embarked upon a rehabilitation and reconstruction program,
aimed initially at restoring communications and essential services, and
requested financial assistance of the Bank. A Bank mission, led by Mr.
Roger Chaufournier, Director of the Western Africa Department, visited
Nigeria for one week in early March for discussions to determine how the
Bank might most effectively assist in Nigeria's rehabilitation.
4.        The Nigerian Government presented to the mission a program of
permanent rehabilitation of infrastructure amounting to about $58 million
equivalent and asked the Bank to consider financing half of its foreign
exchange cost (approximately $25 million) the remaining half to be financed
from bilateral sources. The mission considered that finance from the Bank
should be for the rehabilitation of ports, roads and the railway.
5.        Negotiations were conducted in Wlashington from April 16-22,
1970. The Government was represented by Hr. Adeyeye, Deputy Secretary,
Ministry of Finance, Mr. Usman, Chief Engineer, Ministry of Public Works,
Mr. Ajose, Deputy General manager, Nigerian Railways and Mr. Williams,
Legal Adviser.
6.        The following is a summary statement of Bank Loans and IDA
Credits to Nigeria at March 31, 1970:

7.        Withdrawals against Credit 72 have been considerably delayed and
the Closing Date has been postponed to December 31, 1972. Initial design
work wras prolonged and the civil wJar and jurisdictional and administrative
problems arising from the reorganization of Nigeria into 12 States caused
further delays. Tenders for the majority of furniture and equipment have
now been called for; some construction contracts have been awarded and it
is expected that contracting should be completed by the fall. Disbursements
to date have been largely for consultants and architects fees, but beginning
in the second half of 1970, disbursements for equipment and construction
should increase rapidly. The use of $2.3 million allocated for schools in
Eastern Nigeria and frozen by action of the Federal Government will be
reviewied uith the Government in the light of the rehabilitation and develop-
ment program for Eastern Nigeria.

8.        Construction of the Apapa Road (Loan 426) was considerably
delayed by the necessity of substantial design changes. Work is now
accelerating and the rate of disbursement has improved. However, a
postponement of the Closing Date beyond October 1, 1970 will be required.
The redesign and the delay have also resulted in a considerable cost
overrun.
9.        The roads being constructed in Western State under Loan 427 are
open to traffic and almost completed. The undisbursed balance reflects
a number of factors: delays in payments to contractors, delay in submis-
sion of withdrawal applications, outstanding deliveries of maintenance
equipment, retention money held, and contingencies. This situation is
under review wfith the Government.
10.       The effectiveness of Loan 640 has been delayed pending the
passage of legislation authorizing the Government to borrow for this
project. Such legislation is expected to be passed in the near future.
11.       A second loan to the NIDB is expected to be presented for
consideration in July. The recent appraisal of the cocoa project in
Western State is likely to lead to a loan proposal this fall and a
similar project in Mid-West State will probably follow a few months
later. Further road construction projects in the north, west and
possibly in the east are in course of preparation for FY 1971 lending;
and in the power sector, further lending is proposed after reforms
leading to the setting up of a single power authority have become
effective.

PART III - THE PROJECT
13.       An Appraisal Report entitled, "Transport Rehabilitation Project"
(PTR-55) is attached.
14.       The extent of the war damage, both direct and indirect, has not
yet been fully assessed. This assessment and the measures proposed to re-
habilitate the economy will form part of Nigeria's long-range development
program now being prepared. In the meantime, emergency repairs to restore
essential services, which are not suitable for Bank financing, are being
carried out by government civilian forces, the armed forces and contractors
and are being financed by the Government, partly with bilateral aid. The
Government has also prepared a list of the most urgent permanent rehabilita-
tion requirements consisting of projects likely to be completed within the
next 12-24 months, for which preparation has already been completed or for
which little preparation is required.
15.       The project proposed for Bank financing relates to some of these
requirements in the field of transportation.
16.       All forms of transportation throughout Nigeria were seriously
affected by the 30-month civil war which ended in mid-January 1970. Al-
though the war was for the large part confined to a comparatively small
area in the Central-Eastern State, it resulted in the closing of Port
Harcourt and the Eastern line of the railway leading to the port, as well
as the roads and river navigation in most of the Eastern area. Roads in
the rest of Nigeria were not damaged in the fighting, but nevertheless,
suffered from the rerouting of traffic, overloading of vehicles and lack
of maintenance, compounded by the unusually heavy rains of 1968.
17.       The closing of Port Harcourt meant that Lagos had to carry vir-
tually the whole overseas trade of the country, with the result that the
port facilities were considerably overloaded and vessels now have to wait
3 to 4 weeks for a berth.
18.       The project consists of (a) the rehabilitation of up to 500
miles of highways and the purchase of pre-fabricated bridges to replace
damaged bridges in Eastern, Central and Northern Nigeria; (b) the procure-
ment of railway locomotives, rolling stock, rails, sleepers, steel girders
and related track materials to repair a total of about 35 miles of track
and replace or repair damaged bridges; and (c) the repair of dock sheds
and warehouses in Port Harcourt, mainly roofing, and the procurement of
port handling equipment and spare parts for this and other ports.
19.       The proposed loan would cover the estimated foreign exchange
cost of imported equipment and materials (approximately $13.2 million)
and the estimated foreign exchange component of the civil works (approx-
imately $11.2 million), and provide about $0.6 million for consultants'
fees in connection with the implementation of the road projects.



20.      The list of items to be financed and the cost figures are provi-
sional and are likely to vary during the implementation of the project.
However, all expenditures will fall wqithin the basic categories defined
in the :rfoan Agreement, and will be undertaken only after their justifica-
tion has been reviewed and agreed by consultants and the Bank staff.
21.      Tender documents have already been issued for some equipment,
and the procedures employed satisfy the Bank's requirements for inter-
national competitive bidding. In respect of road construction where
tenders have been invited, bidding was restricted to firms already
registered in Nigeria, but the number of expatriate firms already in
the country ensures a wide degree of international competition. For six
locomotives, port handling equipment and spare parts, where standardizing
with existing equipment is desirable, limited competitive bidding will be
employed. Bidding for Bailey bridges would necessarily be restricted
to the fewf licensed manufacturers, and the roofing required at Port Har-
court can best be bought from the manufacturer of the original roofing.
22.      Consultants will be employed to review engineering and supervise
construction to the extent that the Bank considers it necessary.
23.      No economic rate of return has been calculated for this project
as a whole or for any of its individual parts, since the purpose of the
project is rehabilitation of existing facilities which have proven their
need in the past and whose value in the future wTill be even greater.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUI1JATS OF AUTHORITY
24.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Federal Republic of Nigeria
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a
draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
25.      The draft Loan Agreement contains the standard provisions nor-
mally common to Bank's loan agreements and provides for necessary flex-
ibility in respect of the allocation of the proceeds of the Loan.
PART V - THIE ECONOMY
26.      The most recent Bank report on economic conditions in Nigeria,
"Interim Report on Nigeria's Economic Position and Prospects" (AlW-lOa),
dated September 8, 1969, was circulated to the Executive Directors on
September 15, 1969.  A December 1969 updating mission concurred with the
conclusions of the Interim Report. A Bank I4ission is now in Nigeria to
review the economy and the draft development plan. Its report is expected
to be issued in late summer.



-6-
27.      The civil war in Nigeria ended without significant damage to the
country's long-term productive capacity. Because of its vast natural
resources and extensive, although largely untrained, manpower Nligeria's
future economic prospects are very promising. If there are no further
major political disturbances, Nigeria should soon become one of the
world's eight largest oil exporters.  The prospects for expanding agri-
cultural exports are also favorable. As a result of higher producer prices
now being offered by the marketing boards and the introduction of im-
proved production techniques, output of cocoa is expected to increase
substantially. Although a significant payments backlog arose on account
of non-military imports (equivalent to two months' imports as of November
1969) and remittances of profits and dividends, Nigeria apparently
managed to pay the foreign exchange cost of military imports without re-
sorting to long-term foreign borrowing.  External long-term public debt
outstanding actually declined in 1969.
28.      The Bank's latest economic report on Nigeria discussed economic
developments through December 1968 and concluded that the Nigerian
economr - outside the Eastern States - had shown remarkable resilience
in absorbing the strains of the wJar. The Bank mission in December found
that during 1969 these strains had become more evident. The impact of
the war differed from sector to sector and wzas most pronounced in its
direct or indirect effects on the balance of payments, government finances,
and domestic prices. Although there are no figures for GNP in 1968/69
(latest available figures are for 1966/67), the limited information avail-
able suggests that real output in those areas not directly affected by
the hostilities may have increased modestly during the past year. Petro-
leui production recovered substantially after falling off sharply at the
height of the war and manufacturing output increased. Production of
domestically consumed foodstuffs may have also increased, but not as
rapidly as domestic demand.
29.     INigeria's balance of payments deteriorated somewJhat further
during 1969. Gross official reserves were maintained at approximately
LW 40 million to which they had sunk in late 1967, but short-term trade
credits rose significantly. Thus, the net foreign exchange position
declined from £LI 30 mil'lon to EN 18 million or to the equivalent of only
one month's imports.
30.      Government (Federal and State) current revenues were virtually
unchanged in 1969 from the previous year's level of EN 159 million, but
combined recurrent expenditure rose by 30 percent to £M 228 million,
thus leading to a fourfold increase in the government current account
deficit. Government investment expenditures were cut back more than
25 percent to EN 36 million in 1969. The overall deficit rose nearly
EN 40 million to EN 116 million and was, for the most part, financed
through sales of Treasury bills and certificates - principally to the
commercial banks. Commercial bank lending to the private sector ac-
tually declined, reflecting the embargo on remittances of investment
income and lack of investment opportunities. Thus, the banks continued
to be very liquid, and money supply increased only moderately.



- 7 -
31.      The past year's deficit financing may foreshadow even more infla-
tion in 1969. The 11 percent rise in the consumer price index which oc-
curred during the year ending September 1969 was, however, a specific
problem, not directly related to monetary developments. Higher prices
for domestically produced food was the principal element affecting the
consumer price index.  Despite some increase in domestic food production,
distr-bution difficulties, coupled with increased purchases by the Armed
Forces, the government's obligation to feed civilians in recaptured
areas and the scarcity of imported foods, resulted in sharply rising
prices.
32.      Although there was apparently little actual damage to the oil
fields and installations, petroleum companies, worried about the safety
of their personnel, suspended some of their operations and, consequently,
petroleum production did not increase as much in 1969 as the Bank's 1968
mission expected. Petroleum exports rose from Ell 37 million in 1968 to
LN 133 million in 1969; net foreign exchange receipts from petroleum,
including new investment from abroad, amounted to £INj 69 million last year,
compared to LN 28 million in 1968. Production has expanded rapidly in
the weeks since the end of the civil war, reaching 1,000,000 barrels
per day on April 8, 1970 (compared with 605,000 barrels per day in
December 1969 and an average of 534,000 barrels per day for 1969), and
it is noat expected to exceed 1.25 million barrels per day before the end
of 1970.
33.      In the immediate postwar period, the government must deal with
the threatening inflationary situation and provide relief to the war-
affected areas. Foreign governments and international agencies have
offered assistance. The Federal authorities have, however, assumed the
main responsibility for relief. This means that for some time resources
released by the military are likely to be used for relief rather than
for reconstruction and development.   A limited selective relaxation of
import restrictions for purposes of curbing the inflationary trends may
be expected, but significant relaxation is unlikely in the near future
in view of continuing pressure on the balance of payments.
34.      Fortunately, Nigeria's longer-term prospects for increasing
foreign exchange earnings and government current revenues are bright,
due primarily to the favorable outlook for petroleum receipts. A re-
newed inflow of private investment and foreign aid may also be expected.
Nigeria emerged from civil war with a low and favorably structured ex-
ternal public debt. To satisfy the demands of reconstruction and or-
derly development during the next few years, substantial - but presently
undetermined - foreign resources will be required to supplement Nigeria's
own effort; indeed, immediate rehabilitation requirements are likely to
impose new strains on the balance of payments even as export earnings
begin to rise. However, in view of the favorable outlook for export
earnings - especially those associated with petroleum - and the low debt
service ratio (approximately 6 percent), Nigeria is now in a position to
borrow substantial amounts abroad on conventional terms.
