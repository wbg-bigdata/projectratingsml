1. INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY AND MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS
Industrial Development
1.01      The manufacturing sector plays a major role in the development of
the Philippine economy and accounts for 25% of GDP. The sector is highly
dualistic.  The unorganized sector, defined as manufacturing establishments
with less than ten workers, employs about two thirds of the manufacturing
work force, but produces less than 5% of total manufacturing output. The
organized, or factory sector, employs the remaining one-third of the manu-
facturing work force and produces 95% of total manufacturing output.
Although nontraditional manufactured exports grew rapidly during the 1970s,
industries producing primarily for the domestic market (home industries)
account for about 75% of total manufacturing output. The regional distri-
bution of industries is very uneven. In 1975 (latest available data), more
than 70% of manufacturing value added and 65% of manufacturing employment
originated in the Greater Manila area. Only the resource-based food and
wood industries have a wide geographical dispersion. Small and medium-
scale industries, on which much of the future of economic and social devel-
opment depends, generally use simple technologies. Much of their equipment
is outmoded. Technological know-how is largely outdated. These factors are
major causes of low labor productivity.
1.02      Employment creation in the manufacturing sector has been slow
because of the relatively low growth rate of the sector and the capital
intensity of home industries and commodity export processing. Employment in
manufacturing has expanded at an average annual rate of about 3.1% in
1975-80, creating approximately 50,000 jobs per annum but absorbing less
than one-tenth of the annual increase in the labor force. Accordingly, an
extremely high proportion (more than 80%) of the additional labor force has
been absorbed by the agriculture sector and the services sector. Under-
employment has remained high, and was estimated to be around 25% in the
mid-1970s.
Industrial Development Issues and Strategy for the 1980s
1.03      The Government's industrial development strategy, as outlined in
the Five-Year Development Plan (1978-1982) and the subsequent Industrial
Development Strategy, aims at accelerating manufacturing output, sustaining
the high growth of manufactured exports, processing of domestic raw materi-
als, increased employment generation, particularly within small- and medium-
size enterprises/l, investment in selected large-scale projects, and promo-
tion of regional dispersion of industry.
/1 Defined as less than 200 employees.

1.04      The Government has begun to implement policies emphasizing
regional development, but progress has been constrained by lack of skilled
manpower, remoteness from markets, lack of experienced entrepreneurs,
insufficient infrastructure and inadequate tax incentives. In the major
regional centers (Cebu, Northern M4indanao, Central Visayas), where
industrial development has progressed, inadequate infrastructure and the low
level of industrial skills constrain further development. Plans are
underway to develop 12 industrial estates, as well as export processing
zones and smaller industrial villages throughout the major islands. Export
promotion policies will encourage dispersion of export-oriented industries
to benefit from the low labor costs outside Manila.
1.05      The Government's industrial development strategy focuses on:
(a) nontraditional manufactured export industries (e.g., garments,
electronics, leather and leather products, travel goods,
relatively simple mechanical engineering items),
(b) selected labor intensive industries which could be assisted as
part of the small industry and regional dispersion program
(furniture and small-scale power loom weaving); and
(c) industries requiring new investment and rehabilitation with the
aim of improving capital efficiency, labor utilization and
production costs (mechanical engineering, steel rolling, and
textiles and cement rehabilitation).
1.06      In 1973, the Government began a major industrial reform program,
under which manufacturing employment is expected to increase by 4.8% per
year over the medium-term. At this rate, the manufacturing sector would
generate an average of 100,000 new jobs per year during the 1980s and
account for about one sixth of the job creation in the economy as a whole.
This would be two times the number of jobs currently added in manufacturing
each year. Domestic market oriented industries and nontraditional export
industries would each generate about half the projected increment in
employment growth.
1.07      The most important SMI subsectors, in terms of number of firms
and employment, are food processing, the garment industry, footwear and
furniture making, and mechanical engineering. The small and medium-scale
industries also include many small service workshops. SMIs and the cottage
sector will continue to play a significant role in employment and in
regional diversification of development. The Government seeks to relate the
activities of the SMIs more closely to the general industrial development
program, particularly in industries where SMIs complement large-scale firms.
To counteract the technical, financial and organizational problems facing
the SMI sector, the Government has established an institutional framework
for technical assistance in the establishment and operation of small and



- 3 -
medium-scale industries. The Government is also providing increased access
to financing, assistance in the organization of cooperatives (for
acquisition of common facilities such as pool purchasing of raw materials,
pool marketing of finished products) and promotion of subcontracting, to
link small and medium-scale enterprises with larger industries for better
operating and production efficiency. The success of these measures will to
a large extent depend upon the availability of adequately trained skilled
manpower.
The Labor Force and Employment
1.08      The working age population in the Philippines is growing by 3.5%
per year, which is the highest rate in East and Southeast Asia. The growth
of the labor force is the result of the high fertility rate in the 1960s
and an increase in the labor force participation rate. The labor force is
expected to continue to grow by 3.5% p.a. between 1980 and 1986, from
18.5 million to 21.6 million persons. As a result, an average of
670,000 new jobs are needed annually.
1.09      Export of Skilled Manpower.  Export of skilled manpower is an
increasingly important characteristic of the Philippine labor market.
Demand from abroad for trained manpower grew rapidly from 12,500 persons in
1975 to 142,000 in 1980, an average increase of 64% p.a. During the
six-year period, a total of almost 355,000 persons were employed abroad; of
these, more than 80% went to the Middle East. Seventy five percent were
professional and technical workers, craftsmen, production process and
similar workers (Table 1.1).
1.10      While demand has rapidly increased in the past six years, it is
unlikely to continue to grow at the same pace due to variations in the
earnings of labor importing countries in the Middle East. Between 1980 and
1986 the increased demand for overseas workers will stabilize at approxi-
mately 147,000 workers per year (Table 1.3).
1.11      The outflow of workers has some positive aspects.  It reduces
unemployment and underemployment. It also contributes to foreign exchange
earnings (some $664 million in 1980), which, in turn, create domestic
purchasing power. Additionally, there will be long-term benefits to the
economy from an influx of well experienced manpower when the temporary
emigrants return to the Philippines. However, manpower export creates a
serious skill-drain, particularly among professionals, technicians and
skilled workers, who accounted for about three quarters of the total man-
power export (or over 266,000 persons) from 1975 to 1980. The construction
sector has been especially hard hit by this exodus. As a rule, Filipino
overseas contract workers are recruited from among the employed rather than
from among the unemployed and usually belong to the core group of workers
having acquired specific skills and high levels of work experience over a
period of several years, often working in the same occupation and in the

same firm. Their loss poses problems to the sector, affecting quality and
competitiveness. Replacing them by other workers, through lengthy and
unorganized learning on-the-job, is costly and slow. Efforts to organize
specialized, nonformal training are called for, not only for the construc-
tion industry, but also for other industries such as metals and engineering,
and wood products, which are increasingly hard hit by the manpower export
drain.
Skill Requirements
1.12      The average skill level of the Philippine labor force is very low.
In the 1975 population census, as little as 8% of the labor force, or 1.2
million out of 15 million persons, were registered as having undergone some
kind of formal or non-formal vocational education or industrial training at



the technician level and below (Table 1.2). About 2.5% of the labor force,
or 374,000 persons, possessed industrial skills relevant to the mining,
manufacturing, construction and utilities sectors. By 1980, an estimated
11% of the labor force, or 1.9 million persons, had undergone formal or
nonformal skills training. Of these, however, only 0.5 million (3% of the
labor force) possessed industrial skills.
1.13      The regional distribution of skills is uneven, with particularly
low levels of industrial skills in Regions II, Northern Luzon (1.3%), VIII,
Eastern Visayas (1.4%); IX, Western Mindanao (1.6%) and X, Northern Mindanao
(1.6%). Whereas the other nine regions have regional manpower training
centers (RMTCs), no centers have been established in these four regions.
1.14      Demand.  Implementation of the new industrial development strategy
requires modernization of equipment and provision of modern technical know-
how, and, as a result, that an increasing proportion of the workforce be
equipped with industrial skills. The lack of adequately skilled workers is
a major bottleneck to industrial development, especially in machine
construction and maintenance, construction, automotive and transport
industries, and textile and garment making. Employers in these industrial
subsectors are experiencing difficulty in finding and retaining suitably
skilled workers. The overall manpower requirement (employment growth plus
attrition and emigration) in the industrial and services sectors is
estimated at 681,000 persons per year between 1980 and 1986 (Table 1.3).
Approximately 120,000 new entrants would require training each year. In
addition to new entrants, about 360,000 workers already employed would
require skills upgrading each year. The total training demand is
approximately 480,000 persons p.a (Table 1.3). The training of these
individuals would increase the number of persons in the labor force
possessing industrial skills from 500,000 in 1980 to about 2.4 million in
1986, bringing the overall industrial skill ratio up to 10% (Table 1.2).
1.15      Supply.  The country's overall output from all kinds of formal and
nonformal vocational education and industrial training courses has increased
rapidly in recent years, from 27,000 persons in 1975 to 765,000 persons at
the end of the 1980 school-year (Table 1.4), reflecting the Government's
growing concern for skill training. The output from industry-oriented
courses rose from 12,000 persons in 1975 to almost 345,000 persons by 1980.
However, only 66,000 persons (20%) acquired employable industrial skills.
Most of those with employable skills were new entrants to the labor force.
The gap between demand and supply for job entry training is therefore about
54,000 persons per year. At present, there is no organized in-plant train-
ing for employed workers. Demand for upgrading is 360,000 workers per year
(para. 1.17). Employers therefore have to engage unskilled workers and need
to embark on a program of on-the-job training.

1.16      The Government has decided to focus initially on the development
of small and medium size firms and on nontraditional, export-oriented,
growth industries in the manufacturing subsector. Four manufacturing
industries have been selected for assistance: metals and engineering;
garments; shoes and leather goods; and wood products. In addition,
Government has identified the construction, automotive, and hotel and
restaurant industries as growth industries which have a large proportion of
small firms and for which training of skilled manpower is a prerequisite to
further expansion.

1.17      Individuals Requiring Training for the Seven Priority Subsectors.
Three basic groups require training: (a) registered apprentices, for whom
job entry level and advanced skills training are required; (b) employed
adult workers, for whom advanced skills training is required to increase
their productivity and promotion possibilities; and (c) supervisors, who
require instruction in pedagogical techniques (in order to effectively carry
out on-the-job training) and refresher skills training courses. Table 1.5
shows the estimated numbers of workers requiring training in each category
during the period from 1980 to 1986.

2. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING: AN OVERVIEW
2.01      Vocational/technical education, public and private, experienced
tremendous growth in the ten years from 1969/70 to 1978/79. During this
period there was an overall 100 percent increase in enrollments; a 47 per-
cent growth in the number of private institutions; and a 10 percent growth
in the number of public institutions. While the growth in institutional
capacity has been impressive, the system has not responded to the changing
needs of the economy, and qualitative aspects have been neglected. The main
problems have been identified as: (a) management weakness in the planning
and organization of training; (b) the lack of relevance of training programs
to current industrial needs; and (c) the low quality of trainees produced by
the system.
Vocational Education and Training Agencies
2.02      The Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) offers four-year trade
technical secondary courses in 129 National Schools of Arts and Trades. In
addition there are 1,163 vocational schools in the private sector. Output
from both public and private schools in technical courses (mechanical,
electrical and construction trades) in 1980 was 24,700 (Table 2.1). Through
the Office of Nonformal Education (ONFE), MEC offers short vocational courses
to out-of-school youth. Output reached 172,000 in 1978. Courses are oriented
towards household skills (dressmaking, tailoring, weaving, woodwork and cement
craft) and it is estimated that some 90% of trainees would be self employed
after graduation.
2.03      The National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC) was created in 1969
as a tripartite /1 policy making authority responsible for manpower planning
and development, and it was later (1974) given a mandate to establish
training institutions and ensure efficient development of the nation's
manpower and out-of-school youth. It is an agency within the President's
Office and operates 10 Regional Manpower Training Centers (RMTCs) and 14
Regional Manpower Development Offices. RMTC training courses focus mainly
on the needs of out-of-school youth, and total output in 1980 was about
110,000 (Table 2.1), of which 36,000 were in industrial skills. Courses
vary in length from a few weeks to nine months duration. The dropout rate
is about 10%.
/1 Council members include representatives of the Ministries of Labor and
Employment, Education and Culture, Trade and Industry, Agriculture, The
National Economic and Development Authority, employers and labor.

2.04      NMYC, through th2 Industrial Manpower Development Division  is also
responsible for managing the industry board and tralning tax incentive
schemes. Industry boards were organized to encourage employer participation
in the planning and organization of industrial training. Six industry
boards, nominally composed of representatives of government, employers and
workers, were established by NMYC between 1976 and 1980 in the automotive,
textile, land transportation, power, construction and hotel and restaurant
subsectors. Responsibilities of the industry boards include the planning
and organization of training in their subsectors. To provide financial
incentives for employer participation in training, a tax rebate scheme was
introduced in 1978 permitting the deduction of half the cost of training
from taxable income.
2.05      Other NMYC activities include:
(a)  Development of Training Materials.  This activity is centralized
in Manila where occupational analyses are carried out, training
modules developed and field tested and support material such as
film strips and slides produced.
(b)  Trade Skill Standards.  Development of standards for various
trade skills is the responsibility of a National Committee on
Trade Skill Standards Testing and Certification. Subcommittees of
experts are appointed to advise the National (Gomittee on the
content of the standards and appropriate trade tests. Trade skill
standards are divided into three classes, and testing is
regionalized. A division of NMYC provides technical secretarial
services for the committees.
(c)  Vocational Guidance.  This activity is regionalized and is carried
out with the objectives of channelling unemployed manpower to
appropriate occupations and of ensuring optimum use of existing
training facilities. In order to publicize NMYC's services and
the training schemes available to employers, a periodical entitled
"Industry Manpower Network" is published quarterly.
(d)  Research Studies,  Work has been done on the role of women in the
labor force and their income-generating skills. NMYC has also
completed a manpower resource inventory and an ind-ustry
occupational survey of employment and wages. Research tends to be
divorced from operational activities.
2.06      The Bureau of Local Enployment - BLE (formerly the Bureau of
Apprenticeship) of the Ministry of Labor and Employment is responsible for
organizing the Apprenticeship System, which was established in 964.  Since
then 536 occupations have been declared apprenticeable by the lfinis Cry of
Labor and Employment.  Of the total of 17,785 certificates awarded in 1980.
50% were in industrial trades. The Apprenticeshnip Agreement negotlated with
the employer by the Bureau of Local Employment specifies duration.

theoretical study, on-the-job training requirements and the graduated wage
rate.  Registration and supervision are the responsibility of the Bureau.
Due to resource constraints, no field supervision is carried out nor are
advisory services provided to employers. Thus apprenticeship has become a
source of low cost labor for employers, rather than a skills development
program for young workers.
2.07      Other agencies offering industrial training programs (handicrafts)
include the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Social Services
and Development.
Financing of Vocational Education
2.08      The increasing government concern for occupation-oriented human
resource development is reflected in the growth of expenditure from
P 314 million in 1978 to P 923 million (20% of the total education
budget) in 1980 (Table 2.2). The maior increases have been a doubling of
the budget from P 155 million to P298 million (6% of total education
budget) for agricultural education and extension (Ministries of Education
and Agriculture) and a twenty-two fold increase from P 21 million to
P 458 million (10% of total education budget) for community development
and self-employment (MEC, MSSD, MOT and the Ministries of Human Settlements
and Local Government and Community Development). Resources provided for
industrial vocational education and non-formal training are channelled
through MEC, NMYC and the Bureau of Apprenticeship (now the Bureau of Local
Employment), which had budgets of P 130 million (14% of the occupation-
oriented human resource development budget), P 37 million (4% of the
budget) and P 0.78 million (0.001% of the budget), respectively, in 1980.
While MEC's industrial education and training budget experienced a 30%
increase (in nominal terms), the budgets of NMYC and the Bureau of
Apprenticeship remained static during the three year period. Expenditure of
the available resources on community development and on the training of very
large numbers of out-of-school youth in household skills left inadequate
resources for industrial education and training. The resulting shortage of
funding is a major factor contributing to the prevailing low skill
attainment of the industrial labor force.
Management Weaknesses
2.09      Manpower Planning.  Although the National Manpower and Youth
Council is responsible for overall manpower planning, its present capability
for policy oriented planning needs strengthening. While the Planning
Division within the Office of Manpower Planning and Development of NMYC is
professionally qualified to undertake manpower planning, it is understaffed,
is insufficiently assisted by data processing services and lacks the political
support required to make an impact on human resource policy and planning.
Analysis of the National and the Regional Manpower Plans 1978-82, prepared
by NMYC, shows that manpower planning in the Philippines is still rudimen-
tary. Plan figures are straight-line projections of 1970 or 1975 census

data (based on sectoral and occupational structures of the labor force and
employment), applied to estimated population growth and assuming an increase
in the labor force participation rate. Unemployment is assumed to be con-
stant and low throughout the plan period. Thus, the plan is little more
than an aggregate forecast of labor supply, not categorized by education or
skill attainment. It neither provides forecasts of manpower demand, nor
addresses the issue of underemployment. Only recently have the NMYC Council
and NMYC senior management given priority to the development of manpower
planning as a tool to implement national and regional economic and social
development policies, including the new industrial development strategy.



- 15 -
2.10      There is a serious lack of data, both on requirements for and on
supply of skilled manpower. Inadequacy of the data base is, to a large
extent, due to insufficient coordination and cooperation of the Government
services directly concerned with human resources development, including
NMYC, the National Census and Statistics Office (NCSO), and the Ministries
of Labor and Employment, Education and Culture, Social Services and
Development, and Trade and Industry. The Government intends to improve
NCSO services, including employment statistics, but this will take some
time.
2.11      Agency Coordination.  Coordination is limited under the present
framework, with competition among agencies, duplication of effort, and
geographical and functional overlap. The National Manpower and Youth
Council (NMYC), which is responsible for manpower development policies, has
been unable to coordinate the activities of the relevant government entities
involved in training. This is due, in part, to a lack of clear definition
of the area of responsibility of each of the principal agencies involved, in
part to the preoccupation of NMYC with out-of-school youth and in part to
the absence of a central administrative authority for vocational education
in the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) with which NMYC could inter-
act. To rationalize activities at the national level, the Government must
clarify the responsibilities of the agencies involved and improve coordina-
tion among them.
Relevance of Programs to Current Industrial Development Strategy
2.12      Target Groups.  Greater emphasis on the training of employed work-
ers is required. The four-year secondary vocational courses organized by
the Ministry of Education and Culture have the twin objectives of preparing
students for job entry and for the next level of education. Because of
their desire for higher levels of education, however, 90% of the output go on
to further education, while only 10% (2,500 per year) enter training-related
employment. The nonformal vocational training system (MEC Office of Nonformal
Education, NMYC and others) focusses mainly on the needs of out-of-school
youth, stressing development of household skills. Only recently has attention
turned to job entry training in employable skills. There has been no program
for the training of employed workers. In order to meet the manpower
requirements of the small and medium scale, labor intensive, export oriented
industries, the industrial education and training system will require
refocussing on specific categories of employed workers (para. 1.17).
2.13      Curricula.  NMYC is in a better position to respond to changes
required in training curricula than is the MEC vocational system. Course
offerings at MEC vocational/technical schools are biased towards the needs
of large-scale enterprises and have not begun to respond to the emphases of
the new industrial development strategy. Lack of curricular flexibility is
inherent in the school system, where there is very limited opportunity for



- 6 1
employers to exert influence.  The short-term nonformal courses organized by
MEC's Office of Nonformal Education are mainly in household skills and are
oriented to self employment. Follow-up courses have not been developed. By
contrast, industrial courses developed by NMYC are based on skill analysis
at the job site and are arranged in short modules of employable skills aimed
at easing entry into the job market. Further skill development along alter-
native paths is possible, as the need arises, by taking more advanced
modules.
2.14      Employer Participation.  To ensure that industry specific needs
are met, it is important to have the active participation of employers in
the planning, organization and implementation of training. The industry
board scheme (para. 2.04), started by INMYC in 1976, aimed at promoting
employer participation and coordination with the apprenticeship scheme of
the Ministry of Labor and Employment.  NMYC provided start up funds, expect-
ing the boards to organize their own finances, but the employers gave little
support and no steps were taken to cooperate in the apprenticeship scheme.
Thus, the impact of the boards has been minimal. To further promote
employer involvement, the tax rebate scheme (para. 2.04) was started in
1978. However, the incentives were too small/l, as over 75% of the training
costs were borne by employers, thus discouraging their participation.
Additional financial incentives will have to be provided and training
services improved if active involvement of employers, particularly in the
small and medium scale industry sectors, is to be obtained.
Quality of Trainees Produced by the System
2.15      In the formal school system, vocational/technical education has
retained a second class status vis-a-vis academic secondary schools,and the
nonformal system caters to dropouts. Thus less able students enter the
vocational/technical programs with consequent lower achievement levels. The
situation is exacerbated in the formal system due to a shortage of technical
teachers. There are about 7,000 technical teachers and the class size for
practical work is about 30. This is too high for effective instruction in
trade skills, where a group of 12 to 15 is more appropriate. Furthermore,
most schools have inadequate equipment and insufficient funds for consumable
materials.
2.16      The job entry skills of trainees from the system are varied and
in general low, with only 20% of the output from industrial training
courses in 1980 sufficiently skilled to enter formal employment (Table 1.4).
Employers do not consider that certificates issued by individual schools are
a guarantee that graduates have the skills for the particular trade for
which they were trained. The skill testing system established by NMYC in
/I  Training costs are shared equally between Government and employers in
many countries.



- 17 -
1975 covers only 13 trades, with a modest 920 workers certified in 1979 and
has not yet been accepted by the other uraining agencies.  Furthermore no
strategy exists for advanced training after entering employment. Apprern-
ticeship is time serving, adult workers have few opportunities for trainlrp:
and supervisors and foremen do not consider training to be their
responsibility.
2.17      In order to achieve a permanent improvement in the skill attainment
of the labor force, a series of policy and management actions are required.
At the policy level, a long-term strategy for the promotion of on-the-job
training in enterprises should be established. At the management level, the
NMYC's training activities should be expanded and made more relevant to key
industry needs; the apprentice training scheme should be restructured; and
the NMYC skills testing and certification system should be strengthened and
expanded into a national system with increased coverage of occupations.
Recent Developments and Training Strategies for the Future
2.18      In 1979, the Government, conscious of the inadequacies of the
present system of vocational education and training, set up a Presidential
Commission to analyze the structure and operation of the existing system.
The Commission's recommendations emphasized three basic areas: (i) the need
for changes in training courses; (ii) the need for alterations in the
organizational structure of vocational/technical training; and (iii) the
need to establish new institutions to overcome weaknesses in the present
system. With respect to item (i) the Commission recommended that (a)
long-term formal courses at the secondary level be replaced by prevocational
courses and (b) short, job-entry level courses, to be taught in the
nonformal system, be established to meet the skilled labor requirements of
small- and medium-scale industries. Regarding changes in the existing
organizational structure, the Commission endorsed increased involvement of
employers in the management of training, the organization of group schemes,
and the provision of incentives for training. The Commission's proposal for
the establishment of a Bureau of Technical and Vocational Education in the
MEC has recently been implemented. In order to alleviate existing
weaknesses it was also recommended that a nationally accepted skill
certification system be developed to address qualitative problems and that a
labor market information and placement service be established to provide
training needs information for the training agencies.
2.19      The replacement of vocational courses by prevocational courses
should enable improved and expanded occupational orientation to take place at
the secondary level. Greater flexibility and better resource utilization
should result from the transfer of job entry training to the nonformal system.
Such courses should be linked with apprentice training and form the basis of
structured career development in employment. The establishment of a Bureau of
Technical and Vocational Education in the Ministry of Education and Culture
will provide a focal point for the industry boards, NMYC and the other
agencies and facilitate program development and implementation.



- 18 -
2.20      Within the broad context of the strategy outlined by the Presiden-
tial Commission, NMYC plans to (a) restructure and strengthen the training
management system with the objective of making manpower planning an effective
tool for the organization of training and fulfilling the mandate for the
coordination of industrial training at the national level; (b) expand and
improve the relevance of training to the industrial development strategy by
organizing sector specific training schemes which would also provide incen-
tives for employer involvement and improve facility utilization; and (c)
address qualitative aspects by promoting on-the-job training schemes, the
expansion of the skill testing and certification system into a fully
recognized national scheme, and providing additional equipment to existing
RMTCs for skill testing.
2.21      The Government will be assisted in the attainment of some of these
goals through external financing. Table 2.3 summarizes the main strategies
and sources of assistance.  Past assistance was provided by UNDP/ILO
(US$3.7 million) between 1969 and 1979 to establish NMYC, organize the
secretariat to provide planning, coordinating and evaluating services at the
national level, and to promote trade standards and testing. The project
complemented IBRD Credit No. 349-PH which assisted the establishment and
initial operation of 10 RMTCs. In addition NMYC has received technical
assistance from the Colombo Plan and the Japanese Government.
The Bank's Role
2.22      The Bank's lending to the Industrial Sector (channeled through the
Development Bank of the Philippines, Private Development Corporation of
the Philippines, Philippines Investments Systems Organization, the Industrial
Guarantee and Loan Fund and the Central Bank of the Philippines) has amounted
to fourteen loans totaling $837.4 million, including $242 million specifically
for small- and medium-scale industry (SMI) financing.
2.23       In 1979, the Bank reviewed its operational program in the industrial
sector in the Philippines and reached the conclusion that, while the Bank's
past lending to individual development finance companies had largely achieved
its institution-building objectives, industrial and financial sector policy
improvements should be the major objectives of future Bank lending. llajor
changes in industrial and trade policies were subsequently supported by the
first Structural Adjustment Loan (Loan No. 1903-PH). In addition, the
Government in 1980 and 1981 introduced far-reaching policy and institutional
changes in the financial sector. These were supported by the Bank through
the Financial Sector (APEX) loan.

2.24      The Bank's future lending program would assist Philippines indus-
trial development through: (a) further structural adjustment lending,
associated, inter alia, with industrial policy reforms in such areas as
investment incentives, tariffs, and export promotion measures; (b) indus-
trial finance projects to support complementary financial policy and
institutional reforms; (c) individual subsector loans that would assist in
the development and restructuring of major industries including support
initially for textiles and, possibly the mechanical engineering subsectors;
(d) broadened institutional support for employment-creating activities,
including particular attention to SMI; and (e) training.
2.25      The Bank has financed seven education projects in the Philippines
for a total of US$208.7 million. Of these, one project (Credit 349-PH,
dated 1973) was aimed at the industrial sector, emphasizing pre-employment
training for skilled workers and technicians. Assistance was provided for
the establishment of 10 Regional Manpower Training Centers and three
Technical Institutes. The project was completed in December 1978. After a
slow start, due to inadequate recurrent cost financing and construction
delays, the RMTCs trained 20,000 persons in 1980.  The three technical
institutes initially experienced difficulties in recruiting candidates for
admission because of the unclear role of technicians in the industrial
sector. However, enrollment is increasing slowly, and an output of 516 was
achieved in 1980. Target output is 840 per year.
2.26      The Project Completion Report on Credit 349-PH identified the main
problems encountered during implementation as inadequacy of operating bud-
gets, insufficient staff incentives and absence of detailed project engin-
eering before negotiations.  The proposed project includes provisions which
would mitigate these problems (paras. 4.19 and 6.01(c) and (f)).

3. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Scope
3.01      The proposed project is an integral component of Bank assistance in
support of the Government's industrial development program (para. 1.03) and
would address the major policy and management issues affecting industrial
training (paras. 2.09 to 2.17). Its main thrust would be to broaden and
strengthen the infrastructure of national industrial training. In particular,
it would: (a) strengthen the NMYC management system, enabling it to improve
both manpower planning and the organization and administration of training
schemes at the national level; (b) establish a system of contracting for sec-
tor specific training to serve the needs of employed workers in seven priority
subsectors; and (c) expand the skill testing and certification system.
3.02      To achieve these objectives, the project provides for civil works,
furniture, equipment, technical assistance and operating costs to:
Management of industrial Training
(a) Reorganize and strengthen the NMYC Secretariat
(b) Improve NMYC manpower planning and training evaluation
(c)  Establish a Management Information System and an Equipment
Maintenance Service.
Strengthening Industrial Training
(a) Establish and implement a Sector Specific Training Scheme to
provide training for 76,000 industrial employees
(b) Expand training facilities.
Trade Testing and Certification
(a) Develop additional training standards and a data bank
of trade tests
(b) Establish trade testing facilities
Management of Industrial Training (Proposed outlay US$2.5 million,
including technical assistance)
3.03      Reorganization and Strengthening of NMYC Secretariat.  To improve
NMYC's capacity to plan, coordinate and direct the development of industrial
manpower at the national level, the project would assist NMYC to reorganize
its management system and strengthen its Secretariat. The staff of the
Industrial Manpower Development Division would be increased and Sectoral
Training Units would be established for seven industries and in all of
the Regional Manpower Development Offices. A Training Contracts Committee
would be set up by NMYC. The staff of the Trade Skills Standards Division



22 -
would also be increased.  NMYVC's manpower planning and training evaluation
would be improved, and a Management Information System and an Equipment
Maintenance Service would be established. The project would finance local
consultants, consultancy contracts, and overseas fellowships.
3.04       To improve NMYC's capacity to manage i-ndustrial training at the
national level, its organization and management system would be evaluated to
determine communication weaknesses and overlapping of functions. A new
structure would be formulated, positions identified and Job descriptions
prepared under a consultancy contract administered by the Project Director,
who would submit reconmendations to the Director General of NMYC.  The NMYC
would then be assisted in establishing the new structure. The project would
finance the consultancy contract (equivalent to about two man-years of
foreign specialist services and two man-years of fellowships). The
Goverrneent gave assurances during negotiations that it would submit
to the Bank for review. (a) the proposed terms of reference for the
contract; (b) the proposed contract; and (c) the recommendations of the
consultants.
3.05       To enable NMYC's Industrial Manpower Development Division to man-
age a new program of sector specific training, ttie Division would be assis-
ted in establishing seven Sectoral Training Units composed of training
officers, together with local consultants drawn from experienced technical
personnel in each of seven industries: metals and engineering, shoes and
leather goods, wood products, construction, automotive, garments, and hotel
and restaurant. Unit staff would be responsible for developing annual
training action plans (para. 3.12) and negotiating draft training contracts
(para. 3.18) in consultation with employers, industrial organizations and
training entities (para. 3.19). They would also supervise implementation of
training (Chart 2), provide advisory services to enterprises and participate
as required in the training of supervisors. The Industrial Manpower Develop-
ment Division would maintain liaison with the Ministries of Trade and Indus-
try, Labor and Employment, Education and Culture, the industry boards, the
industrial and trade associations and the recently established Construction
Manpower Development Foundation. Technical staff in the Division would be
increased from 6 to 21 with a consequent increase in support staff. The
project would finance the salaries of 42 man-years of local consultants and
two man-years of fellowships to strengthen the Division (Table 3.3). The
Government gave assurances at negotiations that the Technical Staff in the
Industrial M1anpower Development Division would be increased by about
15 qualified trainirng officers in accordance with an agreed timetable.
3,06       In order to insure objectivity in awarding training contracts
(para. 3.18), a Training Contracts Committee has been established, with the
responsibility for approving training contracts and awarding them to training
entities (para. 3.19) on behalf of participating employers.  The Committee
comprises representatives of employers, labor, NMYC, and the Ministry of
Labor and Employment, and will be assisted by the IRAYC Secretariat.



- 23 -
3.07       To enable NMYC to develop and administer an expanded system of
National Trade Skills Standards (para. 3.25) and an increased number of
testing facilities and trainees tested (para. 3.26), the professional staff
of the Trade Skills Standards Division would be increased by 30, with
appropriate additional support staff. At negotiations the Government gave
assurances that the Technical Staff in the Trade Skills Standards Division
would be increased by about 30 in accordance with an agreed timetable.
3.08      Mlanpower Planning and Training Evaluation.  To improve manpower
planning and the evaluation of training, the project would assist the NMYC
to:
(a) collect data on the existing stock of skilled manpower, install a
system for the continuous assessment of training needs, and devise
means of channelling information to all training agencies for use in
their planning. Data would also be collected on the present
capacity and output from the vocational education and training
system;
(b) study the effectiveness of the present system of monitoring and
evaluation of training so as to assist NMYC in developing a
low-cost scheme to measure the internal and external effectiveness
of all training, with special emphasis on the project components.
All aspects of the industrial training program (paras. 3.10-3.24)
would be evaluated.
The project would finance two consultancy contracts (equivalent to about
five man-years of foreign specialist services and three man-years of
fellowships). The Government gave assurances during negotiations that it
would submit to the Bank for review: (a) the proposed terms of reference for
the consultancy contracts; (b) the proposed consultancy contracts; (c) the
consultants' recommendations; and (d) the evaluation reports as of December
31, 1984 and by each December 31 for three years thereafter during the
project.
3.09      lManagement Information System and Equipment Maintenance Service.
To assist NMIYC to administer its training programs, a management information
system and an equipment maintenance service would be established. The
management information system would provide electronic processing of data on
manpower planning, training programs, trade testing, inventory control,
procurement and maintenance of equipment, personnel and financial management.
The equipment maintenance service would reduce machine breakdown time and
improve utilization. The project would include: (a) technical assistance
consisting of 3 man-years of foreign specialists, 12 man-years of foreign
fellowships and 6 man-years of local consultants (Table 3.3); (b) a mini-
computer with software and related training; (c) tools and spare parts for
maintenance of training equipment; and (d) contracts with contributors to
the N1YC quarterly publication entitled "Industry 'Manpower Network," to
enable it to disseminate more extensive information on employment
opportunities, salaries and training activities.

Strengthening Industrial Training (Proposed outlay US$21.2 million,
including technical assistance)
3.10      Sector Specific Training Scheme.  To improve the quality of the
work force in key industries and the relevance of training, the project
would assist NMIYC to establish and implement a Sector Specific Training
Scheme. The Scheme would be administered by the Sectoral Training Units set
up in NMYC's Industrial Manpower Development Division (para. 3.05) and would
be carried out through a system of training contracts under which approved
training entities would provide specified training for employees of partici-
pating enterprises. Training courses would be improved by restructuring and
by development of additional training modules. Training facilities would be
expanded by establishment of five new training centers and provision of
additional equipment to nine existing centers. Additional mobile training
units would be provided. Management and financial responsibilities for the
Scheme would be shared between Government and employers.
3.11      NMYC has prepared four-year outline training plans (Table 3.1), in
consultation with representatives of the respective industrial organizations
and taking into account the skilled manpower requirements of the industrial
development strategy. Under these plans, training would be provided for
25,000 apprentices, 28,000 adult workers and 16,150 supervisors, in seven
specific sectors (para. 3.05). This training would meet 13% of the need for
apprentice training, 10% of the need for training adult workers and 43% of
the supervisor upgrading needs in these sectors over the four year period
(para. 1.17). The additional training needed to reach the projected skill
ratios by 1986 (Table 1.2) would be achieved through on-the-job training
carried out by the supervisors and foremen trained under the project, and
through other training schemes.
3.12      To serve as the basis for implementation of the Sector Specific
Training Scheme, annual training action plans for each subsector would be
developed by training officers in the Sectoral Training Units, in consulta-
tion with employers and training entities (para. 3.19). These plans would
be developed within the framework of the four-year outline plans (Table 3.1).
Each annual plan would specify (a) the participating enterprises/industrial
associations and training entities; (b) the numbers of persons to be trained
by category, specialty and geographic location (courses would not be
organized for less than 12 trainees); training objectives, courses proposed,
duration, tuition fees and stipends payable; and (d) the schedule of the
various training activities. The Government gave assurances during
negotiations that NMYC would submit the annual training action plans to the
Bank for review and approval, commencing on or before April 1, 1983 and by
each April 1 thereafter until project completion.
3.13      To improve apprentice training, the courses at present under the
Bureau of Local Employment of the Ministry of Labor and Employment would be
restructured by the Sectoral Training Units (para. 3.05).  To assist the
restructuring, the project would finance two man years of foreign specialist
services and four man years of fellowships.

(Table 3.3). Periods of off-the-job training would be integrated with
organized on-the-job training to promote career development within the
subsector.  The Bureau of Local Employment would retain responsibility for
the administrative arrangements with employers for the registration of
apprentices, while the Sectoral Training Units would implement the training
by arranging training contracts. A memorandum of agreement between the
Ministry of Labor and Employment and NMYC dividing responsibility for
apprentice training has been signed.
3.14      In order to upgrade adult workers identified by their employers as
lacking appropriate skills, off-the-job training courses would be arranged
by the Sectoral Training Units. All courses would aim at upgrading the
worker to the next level of competence established in the training standards
(para. 3.25). In addition, on-the-job training would be provided for adult
workers in factories. This training would be provided by supervisors.
3.15      In order to equip supervisors to provide on-the-job training for
apprentices and adult workers, an extensive program of supervisor training,
emphasizing their training responsibilities, would be undertaken. Courses
for this training would be developed and arranged by the Sectoral Training
Units. The objective would be to provide a network of on-the-job trainers
in each industry.
3.16      In the garment and hotel and restaurant industries, training would
be limited to supervisors. In the garment industry, due to the dispersion
of firms and the desire of employers to conduct training on factory premi-
ses, mobile units represent the most efficient means of training delivery.
The proposed project would provide seven mobile units comprising equipment,
trailers and traction units. Each unit would have a capacity for 12 train-
ees and an annual output of about 190. The units would be based at Regional
Manpower Training Centers (RMTCs) at Manila (2), Guiguinto (2), Davao (1),
Cebu (1) and Batangas (1) where employment in the garment industry is
concentrated. Management of the units and their itineraries would be the
responsibility of the Sectoral Training Units described in para. 3.05. The
Hotel and Restaurant industry subsector is in the process of developing an
appropriate training strategy.  To help this subsector identify its training
needs and structure an appropriate training scheme, a foreign specialist for
1-1/2 years a one man fellowship have been provided in the project (Table
3.3).
3.17      All off-the-job courses would be arranged in short modules to
facilitate attendance by employees and promote flexibility in horizontal
movement within a group of occupations, as needs for skilled workers change.
NMYC is already using the modular system and has a stock of 204 modules,
mainly in the construction, metals and engineering and automotive fields.
An estimated additional 448 modules would be required to satisfy further



- 27 -
needs in the existing fields, plus modules for sec-ors where none presently
exist.  These would be developed and reproduced under the project by NMYC's
Curriculum and Training Aids Division.
3.18      To implement the Sector Specific Training Scheme, an innovative
system of training contracts would be established. These contracts would
obligate approved training entities to provide specific kinds of training
for specified periods, to specified numbers and kinds of trainees; while
participating employers would be obligated to pay stipends to trainees and
tuition costs (para. 3.20). The contracts would be negotiated by training
officers of Sectoral Training Units (para. 3.05) on behalf of participating
employers and would be awarded to approved training entities by the Training
Contracts Committee (para. 3.06). The contracts would be signed by the
training entity and the emnpleyer, and endorsed by the Nirectnr Generql of
NMYC.
3.19      Contracts for training would be negotiated by the Sectoral
Training Units with approved training entities. Such entities could include
public and private trade schools, training centers and colleges, public
agencies such as the Metals Industry Research and Development Corporation,
and industrial enterprises. Selection would be based on: (a) the existence
of suitably qualified and experienced staff to organize and implement the
training; (b) the availability and suitability of equipment for training;
(c) the existence of a training program and the acceptance of national
standards where applicable; and (d) the establishment and maintenance of
training records. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that
training entities would be selected in accordance with criteria satisfactory
to the Bank and that a list of these entities would be attached to the annual
training action plans (para. 3.12).
3.20      The employers would be responsible for the full cost of stipends
and tuition fees on behalf of their trainees during off-the-job training.
Stipends would be paid for time spent off-the-job on full-time training
(6 hours per day). For periods of less than six hours, payment would be
proportionately reduced. Attendance at evening or weekend courses would not
qualify for stipends. The NMYC would subsequently reimburse employers for
the tuition fees paid for trainees who pass the specified trade test. The
amount of reimbursement by NMYC for tuition fees would be reduced during the
project as employers assume an increasing share of the cost. The percentage
to be reimbursed by NMYC would be negotiated annually and reflected in the
training contracts (para. 3.18). By project completion, it is estimated
that the few larger structured enterprises in the SMI sector would be
financing about 50% of annual training costs. However, it is not expected
that the smaller firms would contribute more than the cost of the stipends
(30% of training cost). As the projected increasing share of training costs
to be paid by employers is experimental, its effect on participation by
employers would be closely monitored, and would be taken into account in
subsequent contract negotiations. As an incentive to employers in small and
medium-scale enterprises (less than 200 employees) to participate, the NMYC
would, in addition, finance for such employers 100% of stipend costs for
apprentices and supervisors in the first year of the project and 50% in the
second year. By project completion it is estimated that the few larger
structured enterprises in the SMI sector would be financing about 50% of
annual training costs. However, it is not expected that the smaller firms



- 28 -
would contribute more th,an the cost of stipends.  Over the project period,
employers would thus finance about 30% of the cost of off-the-job contract
training, while the project would finance the remaining 70% by means of
IZMYC's reimbursements to employers.
3.21      Expansion of Training Facilities.  To complete the existing net-
work of training centers and increase the range of courses available and the
quality of training in existing centers, the project would include the con-
struction, furnishing and equipping of four new Regional Manpower Training
Centers (RMTCs) and additional equipment for nine existing RMTCs (Table 3.2).
Because of transportation problems and the need to extend the catchment area
of the four new RMTCs, boarding accommodation would be included for about
40% of their trainees.  The project would also include the construction,
furnishing and equipping of (but no boarding accommodation for) a
Construction Industry Training Center (CITC) in Manila (Table 3.2). The
location of the new centers is based on needs assessments carried out by
NMYC (para. 1.13). All the centers would be administered by NMYC and would
give priority to contract training of employed workers under the Sector
Specific Training Scheme (para. 3.10). In addition, except for the CITC,
they would provide regular courses for out-of-school youths.  CITC would be
fully utilized in training personnel employed in the construction industry.
Training would be available in the fields of machineshop, welding,
sheetmetal, plumbing, electricity, auto mechanics and farm equipment repair,
cabinet making, refrigeration, electronics and construction. The minimum
requirements for admission would be to have reached 15 years of age and be
able to read and write. The total capacity of the 14 new and expanded
training centers would be 2,955 (Table 3.2). Assuming two-shift operation,
their annual output would be about 20,000 trainees. All the centers would
be administered by NMYC in cooperation with Local Manpower and Youth
Committees (para.  3.23).  Placement of graduates from the regular courses
would be the responsibility of the Bureau of Local Employment of the
Ministry of Labor and Employment.
3.22      The new training centers would require about 106 trade instructors
(50 in 1983 and 56 more in 1984).  Candidates would be recruited from among
skilled workers and foremen in industrial occupations with preference given
to those who have successfully passed a first class trade test. They would
attend the instructor training course of 720 hours given at the RMTC Taguig,
Manila. This course includes 440 hours of skills upgrading and 280 hours of
methodology, and costs pesos 6,200 per participant.  The cost of instructor
training has been included in the project.
3.23      The NMYC has established in each region, Local Manpower and Youth
Committees composed of industrialists and local Government officers to provide
a forum for the discussion of local manpower trainirg needs, course relevance,
training finance, placement problems and any other pertinent matter. The
Local Manpower and Youth Committee will also provide planning information to
the training officers from the Sectoral Training Units (para. 3.05) and
operational advice to RMTCs both established and new. The Government gave
assurances that it would maintain established Local Manpower and Youth
Committees and establish new committees as required to provide operational
advice to existing and new RMTCs.

/a Mission estimates.
3.24      To extend training to rural areas on an experimental basis, the
project would assist NMYC to establish a pilot rural mobile training pro-
gram. The project would provide equipment for nine units, four vehicles
and a boat. The units, each consisting of a container of equipment and an
instructor, would be based at the existing and proposed RMTCs, which would
organize and administer the program in conjunction with the Local Manpower
and Youth Committee assisted by the Municipal Manpower Officer who would
determine the training needs of out-of-school youth in the locality.
Instructors required to implement the program would be assigned from an
existing roster. The itineraries of the mobile units would be planned on
the basis of the training needs. Elementary courses would be given in the
use of tools in the electrical, carpentry, auto repair and food processing
fields and would last about four weeks. Each unit would have a capacity of
12 places and train about 100 persons per year.  Output would reach about
1,400 in 1986. Admission requirements to courses would be a minimum of



- 30 -
15 years of age and an ability to read and write.  A certificate would be
issued at the end of each course, and graduates would be urged to take a
trade test. The program would be evaluated to determine the viability of
extending it to other regions (para. 3.08).
Trade Testing and Certification (Proposed outlay US$3.2 million)
3.25      Development of Training Standards and Data Bank.  In order to
improve the quality of production and the productivity of workers, the project
would assist NMYC to expand the existing trade testing system into a
nationally recognized and accepted scheme. The number of National Trade Skill
Standards would be increased from 13 to 55 and a Data Bank of Trade Tests
developed during the same period. The additional 42 Standards would be in
these industries: metals and engineering (7); garments (3); shoes and leather
goods (3); wood products (1); construction (11); automotive (13); and hotel
and restaurant (4). About ten new Standards would be developed in each
project year. The project would include 14 man-years of local consulting
services and 5 man-years of overseas fellowships to assist NMYC to develop
the standards and expand the skill testing system (Table 3.3).
3.26      Establishment of Testing Facilities.  To expand trade testing, the
project would include the construction, furnishing and equipping of two
Trade Test Units in Manila and Davao (75 and 45 places respectively) and
provide equipment for establishing independent testing places in seven RMTCs
located in Mariveles, Pili, San Fernando, Iligan, Talisay, Cebu and Batangas
(15 places per center = 105 testing places). The new testing places at
these nine locations would total 225 and would make possible an increase in
the number of workers tested each year from 14,700 in 1982/83 to 20,200 in
1983/84; 26,500 in 1984/85; and 30,000 in 1985/86.
Technical Assistance.
3.27      Each project component above gives a description and the the
cost of the technical assistance to be provided. The aggregate of 6-1/2
man-years of foreign specialist services, consultancy contracts equivalent
to about 7 man-years of foreign specialist services, 29 man-years of
overseas fellowships, and 62 man-years of local consultant services is shown
in Table 3.3.
Support to the Project Management Unit (Proposed Outlay US$0.3)
3.28      The project would include equipment, local specialist services
and recurrent costs for preparation of future industrial training projects
by the project management unit in NMYC.

4.03      The cost of civil works was determined by: (a) estimating the
required teaching and communal facilities for planned enrollment and staff;
(b) assessing minimum boarding requirements as a function of planned
enrollment, trainee catchment areas, area requirement/trainee, and the
availability of alternative lodging; and (c) establishing the appropriate
area unit cost of recently constructed facilities under the Fourth Education
Project and other comparable facilities.
4.04      Base costs per square meter of gross floor area are estimated at
an average of US$154 for covered sheds, US$280 for teaching and communal
facilities and US$321 for boarding facilities. These unit prices are
reasonable for the intended purpose of the buildings. Cost adjustments for
location have been added to the building cost of individual project items.
Estimated site development costs range from 10% to 15% of building costs and
are based on costs at comparable sites under previous Education Projects.
4.05      The cost of professional services has been determined by using
the applicable fee scale of the Philippine Institute of Architects, which
amounts to about 8% of construction costs. Supervision costs amount to an
additional 3%. Furniture costs are based on analyses of recent bid results
in comparable teaching institutions and estimated at 6% of the building
costs. Equipment cost estimates are based on detailed equipment lists.
Foreign fellowship costs have been estimated at about US$1,650 per man-month
and foreign specialist costs at US$6,000 per man-month inclusive of
allowances, benefits and international travel. Local consultants costs
range from $830-$1,350 per month, depending on the length of assignments.
4.06      The cost of the facilities of the four Regional Manpower Training
Centers (RMTCs) compares well with the cost of similar training facilities
under earlier Bank-financed projects (RMTCs under the Second Education
Project, Credit 349-PH).  The teaching and communal areas per training place
would range from 17.3 to 19.1 sq. m. in each of the four new RMTCs, compared
to the areas per student place of the 10 RMTCs built under the Second
Education project, which range from a low of 10.00 to a high of 23.5 sq m
per place.  The cost per place ranges from US$10,600 to $12,100 for the four
new RMTCs, and US$8,762, $5,781 and $6,552 for the Construction Industry
Training Center, the Taguig Trade Test Station and the Davao Trade Test
Station respectively.
4.07      Customs Duties and Taxes.  All items specifically imported for
the proposed project would be exempted from direct customs duties and taxes.
Materials acquired locally would, however, be subject to taxation. Major
levies include the following: (a) 20% customs duty on c.i.f. prices for
imported items; (b) 3% on the gross value of construction as the con-
tractor's tax; (c) 4% on payable wages as the employer's contribution to



- 35 -
social security; and (d) 5% sales tax on imported and locally produced
items. On the estimated civil works cost, therefore, about 14%, or
US$1.3 million equivalent, would represent customs duties and taxes. The
total customs duty/tax component of the project is estimated to be about
US$1.4 million.
4.08      Contingency Allowances.  The contingency allowance of US$14.0 mil-
lion includes: (a) physical contingencies estimated at an average of 12.7% of
the base costs of the project; and (b) price contingencies estimated at an
average of 39.0% of the base cost. Estimated price increases from the base
cost date (April 1982) are based on the implementation schedule shown in
Chart 3 and the annual escalation rates shown in the following table:

4.09      Foreign Exchange Component.  The foreign exchange component of the
various categories of expenditure has been estimated by determining the
foreign exchange content of each of the following subcomponents of locally
procured goods and services: taxes, profits, overhead, materials, equipment
and labor. The resultant foreign exchange content of each category of
expenditure is as follows: (a) civil works, 34%; (b) furniture, 34%;
(c) equipment, vehicles and materials, 100%; (d) local design services,
10%;(e) foreign technical assistance (specialist services, consultancy
contracts, and fellowships) 100%; (f) local technical assistance and
recurrent expenditure included in the project, 0%.

Project Financing
4.10      The total project cost of US$41.7 million, including the front-
end fee of US$0.4 on the Bank loan, would be financed as follows:
(a)  the proposed Bank loan of US$24.4 million (60% of total project
cost net of taxes and duties) would meet 100% of the foreign
exchange cost and US$7.0 million equivalent (30%) of local cost;
and
(b)  the Government would finance the remaining cost of US$17.3 mil-
lion.
Retroactive financing up to a maximum of US$300,000 would be allowed after
December 31, 1981, to permit establishment of the PMU (para. 4.13),
preparation of architects briefs, schematic drawings, preliminary drawings,
equipment and furniture lists and the five of seven sectoral annual training
plans. Details of the financial plan are given in Table 4.4.

equivalent (including contingencies) (Table 4.7). These costs represent a
110% increase in NMYC's 1980 budget, but only a 4% increase in the total
budget for occupation oriented human resource development. In addition to
this the employers would finance about US$2.0 million (including contingen-
cies) of operating costs annually in connection with the project, through the
proposed cost sharing scheme (para. 3.20).

Project Implementation
4.13      Administration.  NI4YC would be responsible for the implementation of
the project and would provide the required administrative and technical
support through its central and regional services. A project management unit
(PMU), headed by the Deputy Director of NMYC, has been created in the
central N1MYC office (Taguig) in metropolitan Manila. This unit forms an
integral part of the administrative structure of NMYC. An accounting system
satisfactory to the Bank would be established in the PMU with the assistance
of the Commission on Audit. The PMU would coordinate all activities
concerning the implementation of the project.  It would be responsible for
implementing all physical aspects, exercising financial control during
implementation and maintaining liaison with the Bank. In addition, it would
maintain the indicators of educational outcomes (Annex 4).  Training
activities organized under the project would rely heavily on existing
technical support services of N4YC, the Bureau of Local Employment and the
Ministry of Labor and Employment. Due to uncompetitive salary scales, key
staff are being lost to better paying entities, both public and private. To
mitigate this problem Government provided assurances at negotiations that an
incentive package sufficient to ensure retention of personnel would be
provided to NI4YC and the Bureau of Local Employment.
4.14.     Physical Design Services.  The design of the buildings of the
project are being carried out by private local architects under the super-
vision of M1YC. Construction supervision would be carried out by the same
architects. Design and cost planning guidelines and criteria as well as
architects' briefs for each of the project buildings were developed by
NMYC with the assistance of a local consultant.



- 39 -
4.15      Sites.  Suitable sites for construction of all project buildings
have been acquired.
4.16      Maintenance.  A maintenance plan and cost estimates would be pre-
pared by the consultant architects for each building to be constructed under
the project. The proposed project would also include the establishment of
an equipment maintenance service (para. 3.09). The Government confirmed at
negotiations that an adequate budget would be provided for maintenance of
project buildings and equipment.
4.17      Implementation Period.  The memorandum of agreement between the
Ministry of Labor and Employment and NMYC has been signed, and the Training
Contracts Committee established. Detailed lists of equipment have been
prepared, tendering of equipment will begin in October 1982 and procurement
is expected to end in Mlarch 1984. Tendering for construction is planned for
January 1983 and the buildings are expected to be completed by November 1984
(Chart 3). The project is scheduled for completion by December 31, 1986.
4.18      Procurement.  Contracts for civil work in an aggregate of
US$8.5 million (92% of the total value of civil works) and equipment total-
ling US$11 million (90% of the total value of equipment), as well a con-
tracts for furniture, materials and vehicles, would be grouped to the maxi-
mum extent possible to form attractive bid packages. All contracts for the
above would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement except for:
(a)  civil works contracts (aggregating about US$0.7 million or 8% of
the total value of civil works) costing less than US$500,000
equivalent (which are unlikely to arouse the interest of
international construction companies); and
(b)  bid packages for equipment (aggregating about US$1.2 million or
10% of the total value of equipment), and furniture and
teaching materials estimated to cost less than US$100,000 each.
Contracts for items procured under (a) and (b) could be awarded on the basis
of local competitive bidding procedures in accordance with government pro-
curement practices which are acceptable to the Bank. Foreign bidders would
be allowed to participate. In addition, miscellaneous items under (b)
above, in contracts not exceeding US$25,000 equivalent and subject to an
aggregate total of US$500,000 equivalent, could be purchased on the basis of
a minimum of three price quotations. A preference margin of 15% of the
c.i.f. price of imported goods or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is
lower, will be extended to eligible local manufacturers when comparing
evaluated bids obtained through international competitive bidding.



- 40 
4.19      Bank Review and Approval.  Design criteria, architects' briefs,
preliminary drawings, and tender documents have been approved by the Bank.
Tender evaluation documents for civil works contracts estimated to cost more
than US$250,000 and furniture, equipment, vehicles and teaching materials
contracts exceeding US$100,000 equivalent would be reviewed by the Bank
prior to the award of contracts (see Implementation Schedule).
4.20      Accounting and Auditing.  The PMU would establish and maintain
separate project-related accounts at NMYC headquarters. These would be
operational from the commencement of project implementation. Accounts would
be maintained in accordance with sound and generally recognized accounting
principles and practices satisfactory to the Bank to enable the PMU to
provide interim and annual financial statements to reflect the financial
performance and position of the project. These accounts, together with
disbursement documents, would be audited annually by the Commission on
Audit, in accordance with standard government practices. In addition,
separate accounts, a separate audit and a separate report would be provided
for expenditures on account of which disbursements are requested on the
basis of statements of expenditure (para. 4.21(f)). A physical audit would
take place to determine the amount of training accomplished and spot checks
would be made to verify payment of stipends to trainees. Unaudited annual
financial statements would be provided to the Bank within four months of the
close of each fiscal year, and an opinion and report of the Commission on
Audit on such statements would be provided within seven months of the close
of the fiscal year. The foregoing accounting, financial reporting and
auditing arrangements would provide adequate and timely information to the
Bank for supervision of the disbursements and general project
implementation.
Disbursements
4.21      The proposed loan of US$24.4 million would be disbursed over a
period of five years. Disbursements would be made as follows:
(a)  40% of the cost of civil works and professional fees;
(b)  100% of foreign expenditure for directly imported equipment,
vehicles, furniture and materials;
(c)  100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment,
vehicles, furniture and materials;
(d)  65% of the invoiced cost of locally procured equipment, vehicles,
furniture, and materials;
(e)  100% of the total cost of specialist services, consultancy
contracts, and overseas training;



- 41 -
(f)  50% of Government expenditures for tuition fees, stipends, staff
training, preparation of teaching materials, and salaries of PMU
technical staff.
Withdrawal applications would be supported by full documentation except for
operating expenditures incurred in respect of Item (f) above, which would be
reimbursed subject to submission of statements of expenditure. Supporting
documents would be retained by the implementing agencies and made available
for inspection by Bank supervision missions. To ensure cash flow, claims
would be submitted quarterly (Chart 2). Disbursements are expected to be
completed by June 30, 1987. The schedule of disbursements is shown in Table
4.8.  This table is based upon the average disbursement profile of other
projects in the education sector in the region.  It projects relatively slow
implementation during the first years, due to changes in NMYC and the new
project management unit's lack of previous experience with Bank projects.

Benefits
5.01      The proposed project forms an integral part of the Government's
industrial development strategy focussing on regional diversification and the
training needs of small- and medium-scale export oriented industries. It
would strengthen the national management of training, improve the relevance
of training to industrial needs, and improve the skill profile of the labor
force.
5.02      The institutional developments proposed would reorganize and
strengthen the management of industrial training, broaden the data base for
overall planning, improve coordination at the national level and reduce
management costs. Manpower planning would be revitalized to enable NMYC to
fulfill its mandate and exert a greater influence on the national planning
of technical education and vocational training. The evaluation system would
be strengthened, external effectiveness of training measured and the
findings fed back into the training system.
5.03      Relevance would be improved by the participation of employers in
the planning, organization and financing of training. Incentives built into
the cost sharing scheme would attract the smaller enterprises. Responsi-
bility for training costs would then be transferred gradually from the
Government to the employer. Initially the employers would finance 30% of
training costs.  By project completion, the larger structured enterprises in
the SMI Sector would be financing about 50% of costs.  Interaction between
the sectoral training units (para. 3.05) and the employers would ensure
flexibility, guarantee the technical relevance of courses and improve the
utilization of existing facilities in schools, training centers and
enterprises.
5.04      Targetted mainly on employed workers in the smaller enterprises,
the project would train about 76,000 persons, meeting 43% of the needs for
supervisor training, 10% of the needs for worker upgrading and 13% of the
needs for apprentice training. Supervisor upgrading would establish
on-the-job training as a permanent management tool for improving quality and
output on the factory floor. An additional 160,000 workers could benefit
from this strategy. Restructured apprenticeship would promote industry
based career development for job entrants.  Increased opportunities for
trade testing and the availability of a wide range of trade standards
developed in consultation with the industries concerned would have a major
upgrading and standardizing effect on the industrial labor force in the
seven selected subsectors, enabling employers to identify their needs more
easily, and would provide a yardstick for workers in negotiating wage
differentials.
5.05      Out-of-school youth would also benefit under the project from the
additional industrial training opportunities in the four new RMTCs, as well
as the expanded pilot rural mobile training scheme. Furthermore, they
would benefit from improved teaching materials and expanded trade testing
opportunities.

Risks
5.06      Employers have been somewhat reluctant to finance the training of
workers on a scale necessary to meet current and future demands. The
underlying rationale for the project is to demonstrate to employers the
benefits to be derived from training; and additional incentives to partici-
pate are provided to employers in small and medium size enterprises, in the
first two years of the project. Nevertheless, the success of the proposed
project depends on the employers' perceptions of the benefits to be derived
from training and the adequacy of the financial incentives incorporated in
the training contracts. Little difficulty is anticipated in obtaining
participation by large and medium size enterprises.  Employers in the
smaller enterprises, however, may be less eager to participate after the
initial subsidy, because of the cost and the fear that better trained
workers may demand higher wages or leave for better paying jobs elsewhere.
5.07      The proposed system of contractual training is new in the
Philippines and may not find as great an acceptance as projected.
5.08      Among the various conditions for the success of the project, the
availability of competent professional staff is most important. Recently
NMYC has been losing a tew competent staff to other better paying employers.
The implementation of the project will rely heavily on existing units of
NMYC. Should NMIYC continue to lose key personnel, project implementation
may be impaired.
5.09      As the project implementation unit would be a new one, some diffi-
culties due to lack of experience with Bank procedures could occur. Due to
the innovative nature of the proposed project, initial training of project
staff and frequent supervision may be necessary.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED
6.01      The Govermnent gave assurances during negotiations
that it will:
(a) cause MIYC to increase, in accordance with a timetable
satisfactory to the Bank, the technical staff (i) in the
Industrial Manpower Development Division by about 15 training
officers (para. 3.05) and (ii) in the Trade Skills Standards
Division by about 30 testing officers (para. 3.07);
(b)  cause NIAYC to submit to the Bank for review the evaluation
reports as of December 31, 1984 and by each December 31 for
three years thereafter during the project (para. 3.08).
(c) cause NMYC to submit the annual training action plans to the Bank
for review and approval commencing on or before April 1, 1983
and by each April 1st thereafter during the project (para. 3.12),
to whiclh would be attached a list of training entities satis-
factory to the Bank (para. 3.19);
(d) cause 1iMYC to maintain established Local Manpower and Youth
Committees at existing training centers and create new Committees
as required within six months of the commissioning date of new
training centers (para. 3.23).
(e) provide an incentive package sufficient to ensure retention of
personnel of NMYC and Bureau of Local Employment (para. 4.13);
and
(f) make sufficient budgetary allocation for full utilization and
maintenance of project buildings and equipment (para. 4.16).
6.02      With the above assurances, the project constitutes a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$24.4 million equivalent (including a front-
end fee of US$0.4 million) to the Goverrment of the Philippines for a term
of 20 years including a 5-year grace period.
