REPORT AND RECMDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOIRS ON A PROPOSED DEVEIOPNT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDON SIA FOR AN INTER-ISLAND FLEET
REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Repib.i4c of Indonesia for the equivalent of
US$8.5 million on standard IDA te ros to help finance an inter-islanX
fleet rehabilitation project.
PART I - THE ECON01Y
2.        The most recent Bank economic report on Indonesia (EAP-27a) is
dated November 30, 1971.   A suzmqary of its main 'conclusions, appropriately
updated, was included in my Report No. P-1074 dated May 17, 1972
(Development Finance Company PrQject).  For easy reference th, economic
section of that report is included in Annex II, which sets forth Basic
Data for Indonesia.   An economic mission Is currently in Indonesia and
its report will concentrate on developmernt issues and prospects,
particularly as related tothe prepara.tion of the Second Five Year Plan
(1974-79).
PART II - BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS
3.        Indonesia's continuing economic development will require, in
addition to substantial external support, some change in emphasis from
rehabilitation and improvement in infrastructure to the expansion of
capabilities for sustained production in agriculture, minerals, forestry
and manufacturing.   It will alao require continued strengthening of the
institutions for the planning of development and *anagement of the economy.
Welfare and income distribution, including family planning as well as regional
development and related patterns of employment and population movement,
will be iportant in Indonesia's development strategy.
4.        The economic work and the lending activities of the Bank Group,
at both the Resident Staff in Indonesia and at Headquarters, have been
oriented toward these development objectives.  The focus of the Bank's
economic work in providing assistance to the Government in the current
preparation of Indonesia's next five-year plan is along these lines.



-2-
5.        The emphasis in Bank Group financing is shifting from infrastructure
to projects more closely related to direct production in agriculture and
industry.   The latter would include industrial estates and industrial
credits.   Transport and other infrastructure will, of course, continue to
be part of the financing program as will operations in education and family
planning.   The proposed project, conceived about two years ago, fills an
important gap in the Bank Group's lending for infrastructure.   Project
possibilities are also likely in water supply, urban development and tourism.
6.        Consistent with Indonesia's large external resource requirements,
and difficult balance of payments problems, the Bank Group's assistance to
Indonesia (aside from IFC investments) has been and will continue to be in
the form of IDA credits.   In recognition of .the urgent need for institutional
reforms, most IDA projects have included major steps to reorganize existing
institutions,or to establish new ones.   At the same time, to supplement the
Government oforts in administration and management, credits have included
appropriate provisions for consultants'services and other technical assistance.
7.        Priority projects commonly involve a high proportion of local
expenditure, and it is not possible to meet Indonesia's need for external
capital if external capital lenders lend only for the import component of
projects.   The Bank Group has therefore covered some local expenditure in
its financing and will have to continue to do so in the future, in cases
where the foreign exchange component of project expenditure is low.
8.        Indonesia has received twenty-one IDA credits amount to US$273.4
million.   Annex I contains a summary statement of IDA credits and IFC
investments as of Bay 31, 1972, and notes on the execution of on-going
projects with particular reference to those which are encountering problems
in execution and giving rise to delays in disbursement.   The composition of
this lending reflects the priorities for rehabilitation and development
established by the Government.   Indonesia's First Five-Year Plan (1969-74)
gives highest priority to agriculture.   The Association has already extended
three credits to help rehabilitate and develop plantations in the Government
estates sector.   Other credits for agriculture include four to assist
rehabilitation of irrigation systems, one' for fisheries and one to help
increase rice yields throughout Indonesia by establishing a seed multiplication
program for high-yielding rice varieties.   The Association also organized a
consortium of lenders to finance a major expansion of the PUSRI fertilizer
plant.   These ten credits account for more than half of the Association's
lending to Indonesia.
9.        In order to accelerate rehabilitation in other sectors, credits
have also been extended for highways, power, telecommunications, industrial
financing, education and population.   Ih addition, three technical assistance
credits have been made to help finance pre-investment studies undertaken by
the Government, which have helped to establish investment priorities over a
wide range of activities.



-3
10.       The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in September 1968.
Thirteen of the twenty-one credits have been made since July 1, 1970.
The program is thus relatively new, and largely for this reason the
undisbursed portion of the credits is large.  Another contributing factor
is that virtually every credit has introduced extensive institutional
reform, involving the creation of new project authorities, drafting of new
charters, and enactment of new legislation, all of which have taken much
time. Several credits - including the first two for agriculturalestates
projects - have experienced pronounced delays in disbursement because of
management problems (Annex I).
11.       Two other credits are being presented to the Executive Directora
this month: a second power distribution project and an agricultural estates
project.   In addition, two other projects in hitherto unassisted fields -
livestock and smallholder rubber and oil palm - have been appraised and credit
negotiations will be scheduled shortly.
PART III - THE SHIPPING SECTOR
12.       The Indonesian ocean-going merchant marine consists of 102 general
cargo vessels totalling 532,000 dwt which operate on foreign routes beyond
Singapore and Malaysia.   These are supplemented by a fleet of specialized
cargo ships carrying oil, bauxite, salt and other bulk products both within
the archipelago and to foreign ports.   Indoneaian coastal navigation law,
like that of most countries, reserves domestic trade for vessels owned and
operated by Indonesian shipping companies; in addition, the Government has
reserved half of the trade between Indonesia and Singapore/Malaysia for
Indonesian ships.   Domestic shipping services are divided into inter-island
and coastal.   The inter-island fleet consist of 355 ships each of over 350
dwt, totalling 450,o000 dwt.  Of these, 277 veasels accounting for 320,000
dwt are licensed to operate on Regular Liner Service (ELS) routes and the rest
are tramp ships. At the end of 1970, only 187 RLS ships (242,O00 dwt) were
in service and even these are in poor condition.  Approximately 17,000 sailing
and small motorized craft, ranging in size from 50 to 350 dwt, operate in the
coastal trade, providing feeder services between small island ports.  These
compete, in certain instances, with RLS services, as do a number of vessels
owned by the Government and the military.
13.       RLS fleet productivity (measuredin terms of originating freight
tons per year per deadweight ton of available shipping space) has somewhat
improved but is still very low.   Port time is high (70-80% of total operating
time) and speeds are slow.   Sipping management and financial control are poor;
lack of maintenance results in frequent breakdowns, lack of shipboard spare
part8 increases breakdown delays, and sailings are delyed to' accumulate
additional cargo.



- 4 -
14.       The Ministry of Communications is responsible for the maritime
sector.   Within the Ministry there are two directorates general concerned
with maritime matters, one for Marine Production and Services (PRODJASMAR)
and one for Sea Communications (SEACOM).
15.       PRODJASMAR undertakes capital dredging and maintenance of the
dredging fleet and supervises the operations of the major Government-owned
shipyards, which are expeoted to undertake most of the iepair and re-equipment
work under the proposed project.   Maintenance dredging is a responsibility
of the ports.
16.       SEACOM is divided into directorates of shipping, ports, inspection,
regulations and registration, navigational aids and communications, and
training.   The Director General of SEACO4 and the directors of the various
branches are able and experienced.   Since the present Director General took
office in eszly 1971, the agency has begun to attack the problem of
increasing4 the productivity of the RLS.  A Dutch technical assistance team
which has been advising SEACOM for the past three years has provided much
needed assistance in planning and analysis of RLS.operations.   SEACOM has
set up a Coordinating Committee to coordinate the rehabilitation of the
maritime sector and the use of technical assistance.   The various Government
departments concerned - Trade, Finance, Communications and Planning - and
the Bank Group's Resident Staff are represented on this committee.   This
body will have the ultimate responsibility for coordinating the actions of
the various agencies in the implementation of the proposed project and the
Association is satisfied that it can fulfill this task efficiently..
17.       Any Indonesian shipping company can join the Indonesian National
Shipowners' Association (INSA) and all RLS companies are members.   The
organization's primary function is to represent its members' interests
in discussions with the Government and with other trade associations. In
addition, it may take disciplinary action against a member for an
infringement of RLS regulations, although this is rarely done.
18.       The Joint Operational Body of Inter-Island Shipping (BOPBERPAN)
formerly a SEACCM agency, now administez the RLS regulations under the
authority of INSA.   It establishes RLS routes and sailing schedules and
issues operating licences, subject to SEACOM's approval.   At present, the
real responsibility for regulating the RLS rests with SEACOM, and BOPBERPAN's
role is limited to administrative details.
19.       Indonesianlaw requires that every ship over a certain tonnage and
with specified equipment be registered with the Indonesian ship classification
society, Biro Klasifikasi Indonesia (BKI), and meet its standards;  effectively
all ships except small coastal motor and sailing craft must be so classified.
However, BKI standards are not recognized by organizations outside Indonesia
and consequently, re-insurance abroad is very expensive or unobtainable.
The technical personnel of BEKI are naval architects, adequately trained but
lacking experience.   To rectify this the Federal Republic of Germany is to provide
four technical experts from the ship classification society, Germanischer
Lloyd (GL), to assist in training personnel and in carrying out the classification
needed in connection with the rehabilitation program.   It is intended that
both BRI and GL classification be granted to ships financed under the proposed
credit in order to assure reasonable insurance accommodation.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
20.       The proJect comprises the following elopents:
a)  a three-year program to repir and re-equiip vessels
engaged in Regular Liner Services and to asaign them
to routes and'services in accordance with the
demand for inte,r-islad traff tc;
b) A program to retire over-age vessela or those presently
operating on liner rovices wW.ch 1Xto would be uneconomic
to repair.
Q)  the provision Of consulting services and experts as
required to improve the efficiency of the four
Shipyards to be engaged in repair work, to assiot the
ship classification agenoy, to improve the operations
and accounts of shipping companies and to assist in a
study by the Government of the long-term development
of the Regular Liner $ervices.
21.       The first part of the project - the repair and re-equipment of
vessels, for which the major part of the credit, will be used - will only
be economically worthwhile and financially practicable if it is accompanied
by the elimination of over-age vessels and those not worth repairing.   The
productivity of the remaining vessels will thereby be increased and they
will have an opportunity to operate at a profit.
22.       A detailed survey covering nearly'90% of the fleet has already
been made to determine the number andtype of ships which warrant rehabilitation.
The total cost of the repair'and rehabilitation of these vessels is estimated
at US$11.4 million.   The foreign exchange component i8 US$7.0 million which
would be provided by the IDA credit and would be re-lent to shipp,ng companies
by BAPINDO, the principal Indonesian development bank (see para 26 below).
The remaining US$1.5 million of the credit would be used for technical
assistance to various agencies included in the project, which cannot be
financed from other sources.
23.       Ship repairs and re-equipment would be carried out in four
shipyards, already selected by the Government in agreement with the Association.
The Dutch Government is providing new equipment for these shipyards.    Japan
is providing technical and managerial staff for one of the yards and provision
for additional experts for the other yards has been included in the proposed
credit.
24.       Assistance is required for the BKI, to bring its classification
standards to internationally acceptable levels, so as to enable Indonesian
shipowners to obtain international reinsurance.   This assistance will be
rendered by Germanischer Lloyd.
25.       The study of the long-term development of RLS services which is
included in the Project, ig designed to produce a program for the development
of the inter-island transport system network and will include the preparation
of traffic forecasts and the study of the costs and revenues of the various
services and, hence, of the tariff structure.   It will also cover the
necessary shore facilities and services and the regulatory measures at sea and
in ports which need to be taken to reduce the cost of inter-island transport.
It is expected that technical assistance for this study will be provided by
the Netherlands.

The Role of BAPINiDO
26.       The financial intermediary for the proposed credit would be
the Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (BAPINDO), for which a credit of US$10
million was signed on June 7, 1972 for medium and long-term loans to
industry.   BAPINDO is establishing a separate Maritime Credit Department,
the Managing Director of which has been appointed.   The UNDP has been
asked to provide BAPINDO with three experts in maritime lending.
27.       BAPINDO's shipping portfolio as of December 31, 1971 amounted
to Rps. 535 million in long-term and Rps. 94 million in short-tenn loans.
Nearly all of these loans were in arrears.    This reflects the previously
less thaLn stringent appraisal standards of BINDO and the poor financial
condition of the shipping industry.   In the past other state banks have
also made loans for shipping and BAPINDO may have to take over some of
these loapp in order to obtain suitable security for ite own lending.
EBPINDO will also review its own portfolio with a view to re-scheduling
loans where appropriate.   It has been'agreed that Bank Indonesia will
provide assistance to BAPINDO for these purposes if necessary.   Ultimately
it is expected that BAPINDO will serve as a channel for all external aid
to the maritime sector.
28.       BAPINDOTs success in making repairs &nd rehabilitation loans to
shipping companies will be considerably influenced by the financial
prospects for shipping which will depend upon the progress made by the
Government with the program.for eliminating surplus capacity. This will
in turn depend upon the enforcement by SEACOM of classification standards
which mast be met by Indonesian ships.   Moreover, the shipping companies
whose ship. qualify for repairs must be able to demonstrate their credit-
worthiness by proper accounts and financial information.   To assist the
companies to do thia, the Government of Indonesia has asked the Norwegian
Government for three experts who would be made available through INSA to
provide accounting and operationil assistance.   Funds for this assistance
have been included in the credit in case Norway or UNDP should be unable to
provide it.
29.       The interest rates for onlending by the Government to BAPINDO and
relending by BAPINDO to .-its elients would be the same as for the credit
recently approved to BAPINDO for industrial financing.   They provide for a
minimum interest rate of 7-1/is% per annum on the loan from the Government to
BAPINI0 and a minimum spread of two percentage points on relending by BAPINDO
to oub-borrowers.   The agreed terms also provide that BAPINDO's spread
should not exceed four percentage points, so that if BAPINDO's relending
rate exceeds-l-lls%, the Government would make a corresponding increase in
the rate chatged to BAPINDO.   A term not to exceed 5 years with one year of
grace has been agreed for ship repair loans.   The Government will supplement
BAPINDO's local currency resources if that should become necessary to make
full use of the foreign exchange provided by the proposed credit. As in the
previous credit for BAPINDO, the foreign exchange risk wil_l be borne by the
Government.. The first 10 subloans will be referred to the Association for
review and approval. ' Thereafter, a free limit of $50J000 will apply.

Economic Evaluation
30.       Usable traffic data for inter-island trade are available for only
one year, 1969.   Since no analysis of past trends is possible, there is
no firm statistical base for traffic projections.  In order to provide a
working hypothesis for assessing future RLS fleet needs, cargo traffic
has been forecast to grow at from 5% to 10% per annum to 1979 in terms of
ton-miles with the most likely rate estimated to be 7% per year.  Passenger
traffic has been forecast on the same basis.  An assumption of an overall
growth in traffic of from 5% to 7% annually in inter-island trade is
reasonable in view of the probable annual growth rate of Indonesia's GDP
for 1970-80.
31.       Most of the project costs are related to the repair and re-equipment
of RLS ships.   From these, several benefits would ensue.  The most
immediate and obvious would be a reduction in ship operating costs.  There
would also be an increase in ship productivity stenming from increased speeds
and reduced in-port time for running repairs.  Finally, ship rehabilitation
would increase safety, with economic savings from reduced loss and damage
to traffic, and reliability, with obvious though somewhat intangible
economic and social benefits.
32.       This economic evaluation includes only ship operating cost reductions
as quantifiable benefits.   The rate of return thus calculated is, therefore,
extremely conservative.  While the calculation reflects the results of
reducing the RLS fleet and thus increasing the productivity of the remaining.
ships, no attempt has been made to quantify other benefits arising from
increased productivity.   The reasons for this limited approach are threefold.
First, traffic data for the RLS services are not sufficient to provide
reliable estimates of results from fleet rationalization or vessel improvements.
Secondly, vessel and fleet data can provide only a very generalized estimate
of increased productivity.   Thirdly, many complex business and economic
factors will influence the numbers and types of vessels which will be withdrawn
from service and the manner in which the composition of the fleet will change
as a result.
33.       The economic return for the project, with quantified benefits
limited to operating cost reductions, is estimated at 24%, declining to 17%
if a less favorable rehabilitation mix is assumed.  These returns are
satisfactory, particularly since it may safely be assumed that they will be
supplemented by substantial other benefits relating to improved ship productivity
(higher load factors coupled with increased sailing time) resulting from
fleet reduction and rationalization, and reductions in cargo damage and loss.
34.       The net benefits from lower operating costs and increased vessel
productivity would accrue to the shipowners and probably would not be passed
on to the users of the RLS in the form of lower tariffs.  The present tariffs
are unprofitably low and even substantial improvement in productivity will
do no more than permit a marginal return on capital.  Tariffs may ultimately
have to be increased and, to the extent that rebating is discontinued as part
of the rationalization program, the effective costs to the consumer may actually
rise.   This would not, however, be an economic cost but simply a transfer
payment reflecting the elimination of the subsidly enjoyed by the consumer at the
expense of the shipping industry which has resulted in the deterioration of the
RLS system.   The consumer would, of course, realize benefits from improved
reliability and safety.



Procurement
35.       The specialized nature of the specific ship repairs, the small
number of parts items required to be secured from specific manufacturers
at anyr one time, and the limited size of each repair job (averaging less
than U9$100,000 equivalent per ship, as against an average ship replacement
value of about US$720,000 eqtivalent) would make international copetitive
bidding procedures impracticable.  Procurement of material and equipment
wil, be undertaken.by shipyards and shipowers in accordance with commercial
criteria.   A review of procurement will be undertaken by BAPINDOts MD
prior to disbursement in order to ensure that cost8 are competitive.
Disbursement
36.       The Assoeiation will disburse 60% of each BAPINDO loan for
ship rehablitation undertaken in Indonesian shipyards.   This is estimated
to appromnate the foreign exchange. component of the work, assuming that
BAPINDO lends the full cost of rehabilitation.  For rehabilitation undertaken
outside of, Indonesia) the Association will disburse 100% of each BAPINDO loan.
Disbursement will only be made against itemized documents indicating that
the loan funds had been fully disbursed by BAPINDO and that the repair or
re-equipment work has been completed. It is estimated that the average
repair or re-equipment job will take 2-3 months.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRiENTS
AND AUTHORITY
37.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between BIP'INPO
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit, are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
38.       1 am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOODATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

III.  Credits Experiencing Delays in Disbursement
The first and second agricultural estates projects (Crs. 155
and 194-IND), have had problems in appointing boards,.executive manage-
ments, and consultants for various servioes.. The Government has been
informed of the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation,
and has undertaken to do so.   Similarly, initial delays have been
encountered on the telecommunications project. (Cr. 210-IND), but all
major contracts have now been awarded exoept for the tropospheric scatter
system for which the consultants have just completed'the survey and
prepared specifications. Disbursements on, two projects electricity
distribution (Cr. 165-IND) and education I (Cr. 219-IND15, have been
delayed because of problems in the seleotion and appoinjtment of
consultants by the Government; for the electricity project, however,
orders are now being placed for equipment and disbursements are expected
to rise satisfactorily.   As to the education project, negotiations
with consultants were protracted partly because of uncertainties regarding
the liability of foreign consultants and contractors to Indonesian income
tax, but the contract is now signed.
Work on the first irrigation rehabilitation project is proceeding
well, and disbursements are on schedule.   The second such project was
delayed by three months due to difficulties in establishing the new
project authority, and further delays occurred because of procurement
difficulties, but construction contracts are now being awarded and dis-
bursements are expected soon to rise sharply.   On the third project,
planning and design are progressing, but there are possibilities of cost
overruns and delays, which are currently under reiiew;> meanwhile,
construction is under way.   Design and construction of the fisheries
project (Cr. 2l1-IND) have been delayed by about one year, pending
completion of a master plan to develop the project site, and disbursements
have been accordingly set back; the master plan is now ready' and prospects-
for successful project implementation now look good. XIn the case of the
PUSRI fertilizer expansion project (Cr. 193-IND), though disbursements
will not rise appreciably until the second half of 1972 ,when financing
of equipment contracts will commence, the project is proceeding well and
the borrower's performance on this complex project can be considered
satisfactory.

THE FOLLOWING IS A REVISED MNDSHORTENED VERSION OF PART, II
OF THE REPORT MAD RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRMIDENT FOR A
DEVELOPMENT'FINANCE COMPANY PROJECT (REPORT No. P-1074)
Indonesia's economic progress continues to be satisfactory.
The economy appears to be growing at around 6-7 percent, while price
stability is being m aintained and exports are"increasing.  Production
of rice, the basic commodity, has increased substantially for the
fourth successive year. In the industrial sector, especially in tex-
tiles, there is further substantial growth.   With private foreign
investment accelerating and the rehabilitation and expansion of damestic
enterprises being fostered under official programs, the prospects of
industria). growth from' the present small base are good.
Economic progress is at an early stagej however, and the
problems which remain to be tackled are large.   The population
project (Credit 300-IND)    represents a first step in dealing with
high birth rates in densely populated areas and marks an important
reversal of earlier'attitudes. Advances have been made in formulating
plans, programs and projects and in starting to implement them, but the
limited managerial and financial resources still present a serious
obstacle.   The pressure on financial-resources is evidenced by
continuing high rates of interest and by the necessity for a devaluation
in August 1971, designed in part as a precaution in the face of interna-
tional uncertainties and in part to restrain import demand following a
loss of foreign exchange reserves. In 1972 there are prospects of a
significant increase in both foreign exchange earnings. and Government
revenues, as a result principally of sharp increases in oil production
and,in the volume and value of oil exports.   The demand for resources
is so great, however, that the need for aid will continue at a high
level, even after allowance for increased earnings from oil, as a
supplement to domestic resources available for public and private invest-
ment and improvement of essential services.
Bank Group assistance to Indonesia'is a part of the interna-
tional support being given in increasing amounts through the .Inter-
Governmental Group for Indonesia (IGGI).   Aid cammitments have risen
from $200 million in 1967 to well over $600 million for 1971/72.   The
proportion of project aid has steadily increased over this period, but
substantial program aid remains essential as support for the balance of
payments and - in spite of strong domestic revenue efforts - as a
source of additional funds for the development budget.   Fbr 1972/73
the Government requested IGGI aid of $670 million, of which $350 million is
for project aid and $320 million for program aid, including $110 million
in food supplies.   At its meeting in Amsterdam in December 1971, the
IGGI accepted this request, endorsed by the Bank and Fund, as appropriate



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 5
in relation to Indonesiats requirements; at the subsequent pledging
session on April 25-26, express or implied commitments by IGGI members
in fact amounted to some $724 million, approximately meeting the
request for food and non-food program aid and substantially exceeding
the amount sought in proJect aid.   In addition, it was announced at
the meeting that Japan would be providing outside the IWGI framework
a further $200 million of untied aid on conoessi aal terms for the
development of the oil sector.  The specific projects for which this
amount would be used have not yet been determined.
The rescheduling arrangements for pre-1966 external debt
which culminated in April 1970 in an agreement on a long-term settle-
ment of the debts held by Wbstern creditors and Japan, and a subsequent
agreement on similar lines with several Eastern European countries,
resulted in a low ratio of external debt service to exports of about 11
percent of exports.   It will rise appreciably throughout the 1970's
as grace periods expire on aid received after 1966, but should remain
manageable during the decade if exports increase, if restraints on
medium-term borrowing are maintained and if new aid remains available
on concessional terms similar to those at present obtained from the
mGI.    All aid from the 1GI members has been given on concessional
terms approximating the standards set by the Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) of the OECD.
