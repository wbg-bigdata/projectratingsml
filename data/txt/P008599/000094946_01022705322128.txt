3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The main objective of the project was to support and speed up the modemization and transformation of the
transport sector with special emphasis on the national road network and its administration, the General
Directorate of Public Roads (GDDP). Specifically the project supported:    (i) improvement of the
national road network; (ii) development of management tools in GDDP started under the First Transport
Project;  (iii) introduction of competitive bidding for civil works;  (iv) improvement of the road traffic
safety situation; and (v) development of modem combined transport systems.
The project has focused on two topics: (a) policy and institutions, including the development and
implementation of policies covering adequate maintenance and strengthening of high-priority roads and
bridges, planning and project evaluation techniques and competitive bidding procedures for carrying out
work, and road safety; and (b) investments in rehabilitation, upgrading, realignment and/or resurfacing of
priority roads sections, bridge reconstruction and repair, road safety measures, technical assistance, studies
and training of highway staff, and a pilot project for the development of combined transport.
The objectives of the project were clear, realistic and important for the country, by achieving faster, safer,
and less expensive transportation of goods and people; and for the sector by sustaining the privatization of
the construction and consulting industries, by introducing a systematic competitive bidding process and a
modem management system (thus improving governance), and by improving traffic safety. The project
supported the 1994 CAS objectives as well as the 1997 CAS objectives to facilitate private sector growth
and competitiveness and to support EU integration, by ensuring the provision of quality infrastructure.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The components were:
(i)   Improvement of the national road network-Road and Bridge Works (US$284.8 million);
(ii)    Development of modem management tools in GDDP - Project Management (US$0.8 million);
(iii)  Improvement of the road traffic safety situation - Road Safety Program (US$7.6 million);
(iv)   Institutional development - Introduction of competitive bidding for all road works and among
domestic industry (US$1.6 million); and
(v)    Development of a Combined Transport System (US$2.0 million).
The design of the project was properly related to achieving its objectives, and its components were well
suited to the administrative and financial capacity of the two implementing agencies, GDDP and the Project
Monitoring Unit in the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Economy (MTME). The project took into
account the outcome of the First Transport Project (Ln. 3193-POL and Ln. 3194-POL) which included a
small component for the establishment of a Pavement Management System (PMS) in GDDP. The First
Transport Project also recommended the establishment of a commercial enterprise (named Polkombi),
functioning as a marketing and sales organization for existing transport companies and its support through
an inexpensive pilot project.
3.4 Revised Components:
The components were not revised, with the exception of the pilot project for the development of combined
transports. This component was designed to support Polkombi, a joint-stock company established under the
previous project by thirteen transport companies. It originally included provision of technical assistance
and equipment through an inexpensive pilot project because of the uncertainties surrounding the
-2 -



development of combined transport in Poland. In fact, the favorable market conditions allowed the thirteen
companies to operate without real Bank support and to finance their equipment themselves and it became
necessary to tailor this component to the fast changing circumstances. Thus, the Government decided to
revise this component to the acquisition of intermodal pocket-wagons for the Polish railways. As mentioned
in para 3.2 the objectives were not revised and this minor component modification was not reported to the
Board and approved by Bank management in a letter dated March 16, 1998.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at Entry was satisfactory. The objectives were consistent with the objectives of the CAS and
Government priorities, the quality of the design was appropriate for a country at that time emerging from
the Soviet influence, the preparation took into account the Bank's safeguard policies with special relevance
to environmental considerations, and the risks were appropriately assessed and addressed in the project
design. The economic analysis was done competently, and the final results are consistent with those
expected before the project began. There was no Quality Assurance Group assessment of this project.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The objectives of the project were achieved. The qualifications that follow must be viewed against the
perspective that Poland was one among the first countries of Central and Eastern Europe to reestablish
democracy and implement decisive economic transformation policies.
All the physical investments were successfully completed with works widely spread out in every region of
Poland. The civil works contracts enabled a recently commercialized domestic construction industry to
modernize its technology and to strengthen its managerial, administrative and commercial practices.
Domestic construction companies, partly through joint ventures, won most of the contracts.
Competitive bidding was successfully introduced and applied for the first time in Poland under this Project
and continues to be used by domestic contractors. GDDP and the contractors are now familiar with ICB
and NCB which are used not only for Bank financed projects, but for all works contracted out by GDDP.
The independent "Engineer" for the supervision of works has been successfully introduced. It helped to
create an independent consulting industry through the conversion/privatization of several state owned
institutes mainly pioneered by young professionals and former GDDP staff, thus avoiding too much staff
down-sizing.
Through technical assistance, the Road administration (GDDP) was modernized. GDDP staff were trained
in the economic and financial evaluation of projects, procurement, supervision of works, modem asphalt
techniques, and pavement and bridge design. Most of the new private consulting firms attended these
courses. Construction sector professionals also attended several training courses on preparation of bids and
on the management and administration of enterprises.
Achievement of the Traffic Safety objective is satisfactory. Designing and implementing a road safety
policy is a difficult and lengthy process and achievements need to be assessed on a long term period. The
project successfully implemented important steps like the creation of the National Road Safety Council, the
establishment of a Road Safety Unit under the MTME as its secretariat, the formulation and initiation of
the GAMBIT road safety program, and the enforcement of laws (compulsory use of seat belt and daytime
running lights in winter). However, insufficient local funding hampered further achievements. From years
1993 to 1998, statistic records show a constant rate of traffic accident (killed or injured by 1,000 vehicles)
which is rather positive since in the meantime road traffic (vehicles per km) has increased by nearly 50%.
-3-



In absolute value, statistics indicate that the number of fatalities and casualties caused by traffic crashes
has started to decrease steadily since 1997 after a 15% increase in fatalities and an 18% increase in
casualties from 1993 to 1997 to be compared with an increase of 38% in motorization. The trend needs to
be confirmed but the positive development could be explained as the first results from: (i) enforcement of
new traffic regulations on January 1, 1998; (ii) implementation of programs for elimination of "road traffic
accident black spots"; (iii) increased road traffic safety publicity and campaigns with financial and/or
advisory support from NGOs and private firms; and (iv) improved quality and increased use of horizontal
road markings. However, compared to other countries in Western Europe, Poland is still a place where the
risk of a traffic accident is high and where the total annual socio-economic losses due to traffic crashes is
very high (about 2% of GDP).
Achievement of the objective in regard to the development of a Combined Transport System is satisfactory
even if (or especially because) improvement of this sector was market driven rather than Bank supported.
Polkombi was established as suggested in the First Transport Project to promote a budding combined
transport sector. However, it requested little support because the needs of combined transport happened
faster than expected. The revision of the component to provide equipment for the Polish Railways was
appropriately decided and contributed to the improvement of the sector.
The Borrower complied with the covenants of the Loan.
4.2 Outputs by conponenits:
(i! Improvement of the national road network - Road and Bridge Works (US$284.8 million!:
The number of civil works (new construction, rehabilitation, and road improvement) contracts was 48.
They included financing the longest (1,250 m) bridge in Poland over the Vistula river at Wyszogrod and
several important bypasses (cities of Bialystok, Swiecie, Nowa Sol, Radzymin and Zielona Gora). They
were all successfully executed mostly before the deadlines, usually within the original budget (excluding
price escalation) and the works are considered of good quality. When quantity increases took place, they
were moderate (with the exception of two contracts, for which the increase of traffic led to additional works
and a 100% increase). The value of the contracts ranged from US$500,000 to US$20 million and were
widely spread out throughout Poland. Most of them were awarded to Polish companies, or to joint ventures
including a Polish company. This was particularly important for the domestic construction industry which
had been recently commercialized/privatized. The project allowed them to operate on a commercial basis
with a long term viability, considering the important amount of funds dedicated to road construction for
several years. In this respect, the ongoing Roads II Project, strengthens this long term viability.
The component also included technical assistance for civil works design ($7.5 million). In fact, the design
was contracted out to local consulting industry and was funded by the national budget. The local consulting
industry did a good job and delivered on time so turning to the foreign consulting industry did not seem
necessary.
The works generated about 10,800 job-years and further employment (estimated at 4,000 job-years) in the
material and transport sectors. This was an important direct - though temporary impact on alleviating
poverty in areas where 10% of the population was surviving under the US$2/day poverty threshold. In the
longer run the project has contributed to economic development throughout Poland.
All works were executed following strict environmental regulations namely on air pollution (use of
scrubbers at asphalt plants), noise (use of noise deflection screens), and water and soil pollution (use of
appropriate dumping sites).

(ii! Development of modem management tools in GDDP - Project Management (US$0.8 million!:
GDDP is now operating with modem practices. GDDP's management tools have been improved and new
tools introduced with the help of an intemational firm of consultant engineers appointed since the start till
the end of the project. The major outputs are the contracting out of the works through competitive bidding
and the introduction of the concept of an independent supervision of the works which was done by an
independent "engineer" who was also contracted out. The concept of arbitration was introduced and every
contract included the appointment of an independent expert to settle disputes (and this helped to settle a
couple of disputes). These achievements implied a major transformation in the management of GDDP as
well as for the construction industry and were supported by intensive training designed for local
consultants, contractors and/or GDDP staff. Laboratories were also improved and a quality control process
in the works was introduced. Finally, cost/benefit analysis was instituted and is now widely used to support
the selection of projects.
The Pavement Management System, introduced during the First Transport Project (Ln. 3193-POL) was
completed and became fully operational. It became the basis of the maintenance budget since 1998.
However, at the moment, GDDP is not allocating enough budget to maintenance, deferring works needed to
reduce the backlog. The HDM III, calibrated for the first time to a cold climate in the district of Bialystok
(close to Belarus border), is providing valuable information for other cold climate regions.
(iii) Improvement of road traffic safety situation - Road Safety Program (US$7.6 million):
This project component was the first Bankwide project emphasizing the inter-agency specificity of traffic
safety issues, involving jointly the Police and the MTME. The Loan financed equipment and technical
assistance to strengthen a rising traffic safety policy. The National Road Safety Council was established as
well as a Road Safety Unit, acting as its secretariat. Seminars to increase public and staff awareness and
education and media campaigns were successfully implemented. Several items of equipment were procured
for the Police to supervise and enforce traffic regulations (hardware and software for an accident data
bank, safety kits, speed radars, service vehicles and alcoholimeters) or for GDDP (electronic weather
stations, salt spreaders, and cat's-eyes).
(iv) Institutional Development - Introduction of competitive bidding for all road works and among domestic
industry (US$1.6 million):
Competitive bidding was introduced and successfully applied for the first time in Poland under this Project.
Training of GDDP/DODP staff, consultants and contractors (about 400 people) were organized in several
regions. Important topics such as project evaluation, bid preparation, bid evaluation, supervision, litigation,
arbitration and financial management were addressed. The independent "Engineer" for the supervision of
works was introduced on a regular basis.
(v) Development of Combined Transport Systems (US$2.0 million):
Originally the component was designed to provide assistance through training and procurement of
equipment to Polkombi, an association of public and private companies established with the purpose of
functioning as a marketing and sales organization. As mentioned above, the need for support was moderate
and about US$22,000 was spent for technical assistance. Thus the Government requested to modify this
component to acquire 30 intermodal pocket-wagons for the Polish railways (PKP). Because of reallocation
of project savings and very competitive offers, 38 wagons were in fact delivered to the Railways during the
first semester of 2000. It was agreed that PKP would manage these intermodal pocket-wagons through a
specialized commercial unit, providing the adequate marketing in this highly competitive area. They are
now in operation and used for transport to Germany, Austria and Italy, taking trucks off the road. The
results of the first months of use showed significant increase in transport of semi-trailers. Currently
discussions are underway to provide a block train (for semi-trailers) connection between Brzesc (eastem
-5-



border) and Rzepin (western border). Operations are supported by large-scale promotions and information
campaigns targeting international and local combined transport operators and forwarders. Additionally
PKP used its own funds to procure another 30 wagons of that type. The results will have to be monitored
and reported as agreed with the Bank.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Economic re-evaluation has been done for the 31 road sections. At appraisal the road
rehabilitation/strengthening works, and the new construction works provided ERRs between 12.3% and
507%, always above the opportunity cost of capital in Poland considered at 12%. At completion
(end-2000) the ERRs of the 31 road sections vary between 12.1% and 567% with most of them having
ERRs subtantially higher than estimated at appraisal. Differences between ERR obtained from analyses
done before and after finishing the contracts are explained as follows:
"Before execution" analyses were based mainly on 1993 prices, whereas "after execution" analyses were
based on mainly 1995 and 1996 prices. At that time, unit price of both passengers and drivers time and
accident cost increased significantly in comparison to other unit costs. In addition, this method of cost
calculation was adjusted to European practices. It affected ERR which included savings on travel time and
investments improving traffic safety.
Traffic forecast for before execution analyses was based on 1990 traffic measurements, whereas for after
execution analyses, data from 1990, 1995 and the first half of 2000 was used. In most cases the real
volume of traffic exceeded the forecast, thus significantly increasing ERRs. Some analyses show that the
increase of traffic even exceeded the selected variant road capacity which appears ex-post not to be the best
choice.
Costs in before execution analyses were calculated on the investor's preliminary estimation with an
estimated annual distribution. In after analyses, real cost with real annual distribution was taken into
consideration. Differences between assumed and real cost resulted not only from evaluation mistakes, but
also from social and economic price changes in the Polish market at that time.
In conclusion, it appears that all road sections realized in the project were economically justified and social
benefits from investments significantly exceeded inputs. No ERRs have been calculated for the road safety
component, combined transport system, consultant services, technical assistance and training components
because their benefits cannot be readily quantified in monetary terms.
4.4 Financial rate of return.
No financial rates of return were calculated during project preparation since none of the borrowing
institutions were revenue-producing entities (with the exception of PKP/Polkombi).
4.5 Institutional development impact:
As mentioned above, the institutional development impact achieved in the project is high. However, the
work is not yet completed. Institutional development is being broadened and continued, especially for
traffic safety, under the ongoing Roads II project (Ln. 4236-POL).
At project completion the organization of the road sector has changed dramatically. Initially, GDDP
executed all works through 238 state-owned companies which were part of and within the structure of
GDDP. All the companies were commercialized, many of them merged, and most of them got privatized
during the period of the project. Now works design, supervision and laboratory controls are contracted out
to independent firms. Competitive bidding was successfully introduced with substantial savings (bids were
- 6 -



substantially below the engineer's estimate, which used to be the contract value when works were
negotiated with the state-owned companies). Now nothing but competitive bidding is used. Modem
management tools like PMS and economic analysis are now used to support decisions on investment and
maintenance projects, contributing to a more efficient allocation of GDDP's budget. The consulting
industry has been successfully and durably commercialized and mostly privatized. Traffic safety is now
emerging as a major concern among Government entities involved in the road sector and the establishment
of the National Road Safety Council was a first and decisive step.
The project also indirectly supported the bank and insurance sectors. At the start of the project, contractors
experienced problems with performance and advance payment guarantees issued by local Polish banks.
Rates and collateral demands were so high that firms could not afford to take the Advance Payment
because local banks did not fully understand the procedures to be adopted. This problem was eventually
overcome as the banks became more familiar with international banking procedures and costs are now in
line with those used in other countries. A similar situation arose with contractor's insurance. Foreign
insurance companies were not allowed to operate in Poland and local insurance companies had no
experience in providing construction insurance as required in the contracts. It was only after the
introduction of legislation allowing foreign insurance companies to operate in Poland that construction
insurance became available and now it conforms with intemational standards.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
There were no adverse factors outside of the Government's control that had a negative impact on the project
with the exception of the national currency. At the beginning of the Project, up to year 1995, the weakness
of the Zloty in the international market resulted in significant difficulties in the implementation of the works
and the financial situation of the domestic contractors. Once the Zloty reforms (PLN) took place (1995)
with a relatively stable currency, the situation changed radically. Furthermore, the favorable PLN/US$
exchange rate generated about US$ 2 million savings which permitted enlargement of the project through
acquisition of 38 pocket wagons (instead of 30), a whole set of 161,342 cat's-eyes, 35 salt spreaders and a
system of 26 weather stations.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Environmental clearances were properly managed, except in one case for the bridge over the Vistula river.
The works for one of the three awarded contracts, pertaining to the river regulation, had to be interrupted
because of lack of authorization from the local government (Skierniewice). The works resumed soon after
clarification.
Coordination among road safety agencies took a long time to develop. The integration of the traffic police
in this context was not easy. Since 1998, and mainly through the chairmanship of the NRSC, the situation
is now satisfactory. A professional road safety coordinator, who is an international expert, is responsible
for this coordination and is finally funded under the Roads II Project.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implenmenting agency control:
The two implementing agencies were GDDP for all road works and equipment, and the MTME PMU for
road safety and intermodal transport. There were some factors which could have been improved. MTME
PMU should have been more careful regarding allocation of funds between the Special Accounts (SAs) of
GDDP and MTME PMU, since the operation of the MTME SA was slow and sometimes hindered
allocation of funds to the GDDP SA where most of the funding was required. The agreement on the
revision of the combined transport component took too long, even after it was clear that Polkombi would
not procure the intended equipment. This led to the situation where the project (US$ 295 million of US$
- 7 -



297 million) was nearly completed but pending one component (US$ 2 million, less than 1% of the project).
At the beginning of the project, the expropriation process was not fully mastered by GDDP and implied
some delays. It was, however, quickly improved and it did not hamper the implementing schedule any
further.
5.4 Costs and financing:
There were no significant changes in costs or financing. The engineering design of road projects was based
on appropriate geotechnical studies and a rather good knowledge of the possible complications involved in
the acquisition of right-of-way. Availability of counterpart funds by the Government was always
satisfactory. The cumulative disbursement curve shows that the project was basically implemented as
originally scheduled (many civil works were even completed 6 months before the original closing date) and
would have been completed on time if the implementation delay of the Combined Transport Component had
been diagnosed earlier.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainabilitv rating:
Sustainability of the project is highly likely. This is because the project was instrumental in introducing
successfully competitive bidding for contracting out of works. The new sector organization framework has
gained acceptance, and the new management concepts are being adopted and absorbed. Sustainability is
also helped through the ongoing Roads II Project, prepared with this project's funds, that continue technical
assistance and training to sector officials and the construction and consulting industries, and provide
business and employment opportunities for the new private firms. However, more attention should be paid
to deficient road maintenance, carried out through force account or by contract but still insufficiently
budgeted.
The state-owned companies were commercialized and in some cases privatized, allowing a budding private
sector to emerge as a provider of consulting and construction of civil works. Local companies won most of
the contracts and some of them (mostly subsidiaries of EU firms) are now competing in the EU in joint
venture with their parent company. This shows the sustainability of the general improvement of the sector
and its progress towards the requirements of EU accession to compete and survive in the EU market.
As a consequence of the general improvement of the road sector, further involvement of the Bank in another
"classic investment project" beyond the ongoing Roads II Project (expected closing date June 30, 2003) is
probably unlikely. However, cooperation is still strongly needed for road maintenance and traffic safety.
This would be the opportunity to focus mainly on improving budget allocation between maintenance and
investment (as mentioned below) and introducing new management methods such as performance-based
maintenance contracts.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Roads are a substantial asset built and rehabilitated year after year and, in this respect, maintenance is a
priority in order to keep this asset at the quality level needed to fulfill its role in the economy. The Road
Funding Law of August 29, 1997 allocates to GDDP a fraction (30%) of taxes levied on gasoline for
maintenance. GDDP now masters economic analysis and can plan an effective use of its resources. GDDP
can make the optimal choices of road sections to be improved and of the type of pavement to be selected
using the Pavement Management System improved through this project. Therefore it is expected that
GDDP will carry out the appropriate maintenance. However, at the moment, GDDP is not allocating
enough budget to maintenance, deferring works needed to reduce the backlog. In addition, and looking
ahead to Poland's accession to the EU, to avoid rapid deterioration of the network particular attention will
have to be paid to the harmonization of axle-load regulations since the Polish standard axle-load has to be
- 8 -



increased from lOT to the European standard of 11.5T (which was taken into account in this project).
GDDP's Josefow training center was supported and improved through the project. The location of this fully
residential training center, hardly 30 minutes from downtown Warsaw, is ideal for meeting most of GDDP
future nationwide training requirements, thus allowing dissemination to all GDDP staff of the knowledge
acquired through the project.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Bank staff appraised the project thoroughly and in close cooperation with the Borrower. The project
objectives were clear and specific and the development-stage appropriate. The components supported the
project objectives and addressed the most timely topics.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision of the physical and institutional project components was conscientious and professional.
Skill-mix and continuity of the team were satisfactory. There were initially some troublesome delays with a
few expropriations and a missing environmental authorization which stopped one of the three contracts at
the Vistula bridge, but all were soon satisfactorily resolved. Team members were involved in three training
sessions providing lectures (mostly question and answer sessions) mainly on project management, leasing
and Bank policy on procurement.
The Bank supervision team could, however, have paid more attention to the implementation of the
Combined Transport component. If the lack of interest of Polkombi in implementing this component had
been assessed and agreed on earlier, the revision of this component would have not needed an extension of
the closing date to procure the intermodal pocket wagons for PKP. Agreeing with MTME PMU on how to
revise the intermodal component also took additional time. Nevertheless, the change in the intermodal
component was eventually well implemented and this extension allowed procurement of additional traffic
safety equipment with saved funds.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Bank performance was satisfactory for the reasons outlined above.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Project preparation was led by the Bank under an efficient and intense collaboration and contribution from
the Government which provided all required information under the difficult conditions of rapid change in
1991 and 1992. The continuity, adaptability and competence of Government staff providing documentation
according to modernized and western-like procedures and format should be highly commended.
7.5 Government implementation perfbrmance:
The Government implementation performance was highly satisfactory for the construction component. The
decisions were taken in an appropriate and timely way. Regarding the traffic safety component, it took
some time to build momentum because of the complexity of the subject (mainly inter-agency coordination),
but the outcome was satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
GDDP was impeccable in the implementation of the project components. One minor shortcoming in
overlooking the local environmental permit in one contract was quickly resolved. It did not happen again.
9-



Overall, works were completed on schedule.
The MTME was somewhat slow in taking decisions, particularly on road safety, but traffic safety is known
to be a difficult issue that needs to be addressed with a long term view. Difficulties to assess the
implementation of the intermodal component required an extension of the closing date, leading to a one-year
delay in the completion of the project. Although eventually the decisions were rightly taken, the
achievements on road safety and intermodal transport could have been reached more expeditiously.
7.7 Overall Borrowerperformance:
Borrower performance was satisfactory for the reasons outlined above.
8. Lessons Learned
There are several lessons to be learned from this project, many of which have been observed in similar
projects and are reinforced by this additional experience. They include:
(i) Good projects are usually the result of working with good counterparts.
In this case, the counterparts were competently trained, willing and able to learn fast and dedicated
individuals who could and did benefit from additional financial resources and exposure to new technical
and managerial methods. It is a lesson which is not new for those who have worked in development, and
which is broadly applicable to virtually all sectors and projects.
(ii) Road Administrations should keep in mind the following guidelines:
- Planning for the use of resources should be based on economic analysis that identifies the optimal
choices of road sections to be improved and the type of pavement improvement to be carried out, through
the use of the HDM computer program or similar system.
- Contracting on a competitive basis decreases cost and improves efficiency; it should be used for
every investment contract.
- Perforning expropriations in a timely manner avoids any unexpected delays in the start of the works.
This is a difficult issue, as decisions on expropriation are often beyond the direct control of the project
implementation unit, but it should be cleared before work starts.
- Being careful regarding environmental assessments and their inter-ministerial and local endorsement
avoids any unexpected and costly work disruptions or breaks.
- Careful supervision of contractor performance is needed to assure adequate quality of works, with
payments tied to fulfilling the quality requirements.
(iii) Designing and implementing a Road Safety Policy is a difficult and long term process. From all the
involved agencies as well as other government bodies, it requires:
- increasing awareness of traffic safety issues,
- good coordmation,
- strong ownership, and
- adequate funding.
(iv) European integretion and particularly EU accession play an accelerating role in institutional reforms if
a good partnership is established among all partners. In the road sub-sector, the following key issues lend
themselves for comprehensive cooperation (including potential grant financing). In this respect, the
following should be considered:
- Establishing an adequate and EU compatible system of Road User Charges (included in the follow-up
project Roads II),
- 10 -



- Improving traffic safety (this was taken into account in this project); and
- Designing new pavements and strengthening existing pavements in accordance with the EU standard
axle-load (11.5 T). This was taken into account in this project.
In fact, these principles apply to virtually all road administrations in Central and Eastern Europe.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The borrower provided a draft ICR (see Annex 8) which is reflected in the final ICR.
(b) Cofinanciers:
There were no cofinanciers.
(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
There were no other partners.
10. Additional Information
An analysis of the cost per km is provided in this section. It gives a range of cost incurred during the
execution of the project but with variations from one to threefold for the construction of a single
carriageway (often including shoulders) or for the improvement/resurfacing of a single carriageway
including construction of shoulders. This wide range should be explained mainly by the differences in each
contract (number of bridges, of interchanges, etc...). The type refers to the main category of the works.
More information on the scope of work for each section is available in the project files.
Basically the different types are identified as follow:
2x2             construction of a dual carriageway including shoulders
7m              construction of a single carriageway often including shoulders
bridge          mostly construction of bridges, may include some pavement
improvement     resurfacing of a single carriageway including construction of shoulders
urban           same as improvement but in an urban area.

*  Development of modem management tools in GDDP
A total of 14 civil work schemes were identified originally in the SAR for execution under the project and as the
project progressed this figure was revised and reassessed and a total of 48 civil works contracts received funding
from the project. The selection was to be based on economic criteria , requiring a minimum ERR of 12 % and
provided also that other criteria regarding environmental protection and safety were met.
Key sections of national highway were to be earmarked for strengthening and improvement, and in certain cases
for by-passing of congested urban areas. Elimination of accident blackspots, difficult passages through towns,
safety barriers and reflectorised road markings were also to be included. As a result of the serious backlog in
Poland of major bridge repairs the program was also to include the repair and reconstruction of high priority
bridges, and in some cases, the construction of new permanent structures to replace existing.
To assist GDDP with its ability to manage and plan its activities a Technical Assistance and Training component
was envisaged, which included the appointment of an international firm of consulting engineer's and the
preparation and implementation of a training programme. Overseas study tours and visits were also to be
included for selected staff as well as continued assistance and equipment for the development of the Pavement
Management System begun under the First Transport Project.
Another important aspect of the project was aimed at the privatisation and commercialisation of the local Road
and Bridge construction sector. Local contracting firms were to be encouraged to undergo restructuring and to
form joint ventures with foreign firms. The loan proceeds and the Government's contribution to the cost of the
project would be an important source of revenue for local contractors and would help to generate local
employment.
2.      ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
A total of 48 civil works contracts were successfully procured and completed under the project and are
summarised as follows:-
-22-



* New bypasses -                                                    13 No.
* Bridges (modernisation/new) -                                     11 No.
* Rehabilitation/modernisation of existing sections of road -       25 No.
Important sections of national highway have been improved and made safer and will as a result reduce traffic
congestion, accidents and will improve the burden of inconvenience placed on road users as a result of the
deterioration of the road network that has taken place in Poland over recent years.
A list of the Contracts undertaken together with their Contract and Final values is given in table 1. The revised
economic rates of return together with the originally forecasted and new traffic volumes are given in table 4
...... (nalezy dolqczye).
It should be mentioned that 2 Contracts, with World Bank acceptance, have had the original scope of their work
increased by almost twice their original value. The first of these Contract 11.1 Czestochowa - Katowice required
a redesign and a reassessment of traffic safety and management of local and transit traffic as a result of the
unexpected increase in traffic. The second Contract 27 Radzymin bypass involved a change from single to dual
carriageway.
The introduction of the World Bank Roads project has been an important boost to the road contracting industry
in Poland during a period which has seen the transformation of many state owned contracting enterprises into
independent commercial entities, many of which have been or are being privatised. The introduction of
international competitive bidding and international conditions of contract as those adopted by the World Bank
and ]FIDIC has achieved greater competition and a consequent fall in tender prices. The appearance of
international contracting organisations in the Polish market have affected the strategies and operation of local
contracting organisations and many have now incorporated modern management techniques, have become better
comrnercially orientated and are competing successfully against foreign competition. Figure 1 below depicts the
level of participation of the various contracting organisations involved in the Roads Project.

Over the years of the project there has been a steady increase in the number of privately owned local consulting
companies. These firms have been involved in design and supervision of Works.
- 23 -



Another important effect of the project has been the employment it has generated. It is estimated that the civil
works component has generated 130,000 man/months of work. This figure comprises of operatives and
supervision staff employed directly on site, however, it should also be remembered that further employment has
been generated indirectly in the administration, materials, production and transport sectors.
The GDDP TA and training objectives have been quite extensive. An international firm of consulting engineers
Scott Wilson from UK were hired through ICB to provide consulting services by way of two permanent resident
advisors and visiting specialists as and when required. The two resident advisors provided advice and training to
counterpart staff on all matters of the project pertaining to management, procurement, and financial issues
including also site management and contract management. Visiting specialists have advised on ways to improve
contract and specification documents, the causes of rutting problems and environmental management of road
surface run off.
The resident advisors have actively participated in support and training for staff of the PMU, GDDP, DODP,
private local consulting firms, local contracting organisations and adjudicators. Training courses and seminars
have been held for supervision staff together with practical on site training follow up visits, which have over the
years helped to improve the general level and concept of engineering supervision on site. Similarly a need was
established to help local contractors and adjudicators and training courses and seminars were held covering
modern contracting techniques and contract interpretation.
The courses have been attended by over 400 people and as a result of the knowledge and experience gained on
the project many have achieved promotion within GDDP. A large number have moved from GDDP/DODP to
the private sector and are now employed in consulting firms and contracting organisations.
Under this component in 1994 the Finnish Institute for Highway and Maritime Education in conjunction with
Warsaw Polytechnic and the Road and Bridge Research Institute prepared a study report on the Establishment of
a training system for the Road Administration and Road Enterprises in Poland. This report included a very
extensive training needs assessment for the entire road sector.
A network of regional training centres has been used for training purposes owned and maintained by the
Regional Directorates. In January 1997 following an extensive refurbishment programme a national Training
Centre in J6zef6w near Warsaw was opened, under the management of Warsaw DODP. The centre is equipped
with modern conference facilities and equipment, lecture rooms, classrooms and can accommodate up to 45
people for overnight stays. Since its opening in 1997 the centre has become the main venue for all World Bank
training courses and seminars.
Site Supervision Training
At the start of the project nearly all of the site supervision was carried out by staff of the Regional DODP but due
to lack of resources and staff this was found to be insufficient. A large emphasis was, therefore, placed on the
promotion, establishment and training of private local consultants capable of supervising road and bridge
contracts to international standards. This has now led to the situation where the majority of site supervision is
now being carried out by private consultants. This is reflected in a higher degree of quality in the Works, and an
important creation of consultancy industry capacity in the country.
The first supervision training courses began in January 1995. A training course manual was prepared by the
advisors. The intention of the courses was to host up to 20 engineers per session over a period of a week. The
course covered various topics such as international forms of contracting and bidding, World Bank
prequalification and bid evaluation procedures, site administration and supervision procedures, and the World
Bank Smaller Works Conditions of Contract. Workshops were also introduced covering assessment of
Contractors programmes, payments, valuations of variations and claims. A total of 12 courses were held attended
by a total of 234 delegates. A total of 12 two day follow up seminars were held after the courses to discuss any
further practical problems the delegates may have encountered in the day to day running of their sites.
-24-



Following the success of the first supervision courses a need was established to prepare a second updated course
that would cover changes to the existing World Bank Conditions of Contract, the World Bank NCB procedures
for the flood relief contracts of the second Roads project and more advanced site supervision techniques and
contractual problems. As with the first set of courses a training course manual was prepared and 3 courses were
held attended by a total of 63 delegates.
Training of Contractors
Two training seminars were held for local Contractors on the topic of bidding and cost management techniques.
Representatives from over forty contracting companies were invited to attend. The delegates were mainly staff
involved with estimating and bid preparation from small companies with little or no experience of World Bank
Contracts. The aim of the course was to introduce them to international procedures and practices for bidding and
management of Works under the 1995 edition of the World Bank Procurement Procedures. During the course
guest speakers were invited from various international companies to give talks on construction insurance, the
formation of joint ventures and plant leasing arrangements.
Training of Adjudicators
Following a number of contractually incorrect decisions and awards made by local adjudicators it was decided to
prepare a seminar on the topic of adjudication and arbitration. The seminar was prepared and delivered by Mr
Gordon Bathgate, an Arbitrator of the UK's institute of Civil Engineers, and was translated by the two advisors
into Polish. The aim of the seminar was to familiarise the delegates with dispute resolution procedures. The
following subjects were covered:
* The introduction and analysis of claims
* Litigation
* Arbitration
. Adjudication
* Conciliation
* Expert determination
* Dispute Review Boards
* The Essential Features of an Arbitral Decree
* UNCITRAL Model Law
* Contractual Claims
Tutorials were also held where the delegates were required to analyse and resolve practical contractual problems.
The seminar was attended by 20 delegates.
Training of Finance Staff
Counterpart staff within the GDDP's PMU have been trained in World Bank disbursement techniques, Special
Account management, control of Contract payments to suppliers and Contractors, computer processing and in
the area of Bank Guarantees, Insurance Bonds and Letters of Credit.
Furthermore, several, seminars have been held for both GDDP and DODP finance staff on World Bank finance
related topics such as funding, project performance, contractual payments and obligations, cash-flow planning
and forecasting, and contract insurance requirements.
Overseas Training
Delegations of Engineers from the GDDP and DODP's involved with the Roads Project have travelled to the UK
and visited SWK's offices in Basingstoke. An extensive series of visits and talks on road construction,
management and safety were arranged and included visits to the Highways Agency, Hampshire County Councils
- 25 -



Highways Department and a visit to the Transport Roads Research Laboratory. The visits also included a site
visit to a major UK Road construction Contract where the delegates were shown how UK site supervision and
Contract administration were being implemented.
3.     PROBLEMS AND LESSONS LEARNT
As a result of the diversity in the quality and type of bidding documentation and as a result of World Bank
requirements it was necessary to try to standardise bidding documents, specifications and bills of quantities. As
this project was the first of its kind the documents used were found to be of use on other internationally funded
projects and eventually were also incorporated in a similar format on nationally procured projects.
Errors and omissions contained in Bidding Documents have on a number of occasions given rise to claims for
additional costs. Greater care should therefore be given in preparing Bidding documents and design consultants
should be made to account for their mistakes.
The proportion of work that could be subcontracted has on a number of contracts affected performance and for
future contracts this level has now been revised.
It has been observed that the over assessment of contract durations is often the cause of slow contract start up
and new contracts should address this problem.
Cash flow forecasting has often resulted in an overestimation of funding requirements. Measures will have to be
introduced to reduce such problems on future projects.
At the start of the project problems were experienced with Performance and Advance Payment guarantees issued
by local Polish banks. Rates and collateral demands were so high that four of the six firms awarded the first
contracts could not afford to take the Advance Payment. At the time such guarantees were new to Poland and
local banks did not fully understand the procedures to be adopted. This problem was eventually overcome as the
banks became more familiar with international banking procedures and costs are now in line with those used in
other countries.
A similar situation arose with contractor's insurance. At the start of the project foreign insurance companies
were not permitted to operate in Poland. Local insurance companies had not previously provided construction
insurance cover of the type required by the World Bank conditions of Contract and in common use
internationally, and the policies offered by them did not comply with Contract conditions. It was only after the
introduction of legislation allowing foreign insurance companies to operate in Poland that a market was formed
for construction insurance and the level and type of cover now given conforms with international standards.
As a result of large staff turnovers the GDDP is finding that many of the staff that achieved experience and
training under the Project have now moved over to the private sector. New people now have to be trained as not
all staff had the opportunity to participate on the previous training courses. The training component introduced
into the Roads II project is intending to address this problem.
There are few young engineers working in the industry. This is mainly as a result of the difficulties in obtaining
construction supervision licences, which require experience to be gained on building work and not civil
engineering road and bridge projects. Major changes in the rules and regulations for the issue of construction
supervision licences is required in order to encourage young engineers to join the industry.
4.   BORROWER AND BANK PERFORMANCE
-26-



The GDDP is very appreciative of the help, work and advice given to them by the Bank's staff during the
implementation of the Project. The contribution and work of the Task Manager's Mr Jeremy Lane and Mr Luis
Revuelta, and their supervision missions, have contributed greatly to the final success and achievements of the
Project. There were, however, at times, problems with timely replenishments of the Special Account. This was
particularly noticeable during busy construction periods where many payments were having to be processed and
paid. The method of Direct Payments did help in overcoming some of these problems.
In accordance with the terms of the loan agreement budgetary expenditures for national road maintenance have
been satisfied and have seen steady annual increases. The funding for national investment in roads is now firmly
in place and should continue to increase over the coming years in order that the required improvements to the
road network may be met.

ROAD SAFETY COMPONENT
EXECUTING AGENCY - MTMEIPOLICE
1.     PROJECT OBJECTIVES
As stated in the SAR for the Roads Project of February 11, 1993, the purpose of the Component was to provide
support for diminishing the number of road accidents in Poland. This objective was to be achieved through
adoption of adequate administrative measures and procurement of appropriate technical assistance, equipment
and materials. Within that context the following actions to be taken under the Road Safety Component were
identified:
* designating a member of government with overall responsibility for road traffic safety;
* establishment of the post of Road Safety Coordinator and establishment of the Road Safety Unit;
* technical assistance and training for the Road Safety Unit to develop a coherent plan to reduce road
accidents;
*  major public awareness and education campaigns;
* equipment for the traffic police to supervise and enforce traffic regulations;
* accident black spot elimination projects.
It was decided that an amount in the order of USD 5 million would be allocated to the Road Safety Component.
Based on the Road Safety Action Plan understanding was reached regarding ToR for technical assistance and
training and the list of equipment to be procured. The administrative arrangements to handle road safety issues
were agreed and the appointment of a member of the Government as Road Safety Coordinator with overall
responsibility for traffic safety, to be assisted by a high rank level civil servant was confirmed.

2.     ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
2.1.   Administrative measures
2.1.1. Establishment of the Road Safety Council
In order to provide guidelines and coordinate activities aimed at improvement of road safety, in accordance with
SAR requirements, the Road Safety Council was brought into being on October 21, 1993, chaired by the Deputy
Prime Minister and then by the Prime Minister himself. The Secretary of State in MTME was appointed the
National Road Safety Coordinator. On October 6, 1998 the Road Safety Council was reanimated and has been
headed by the Minister of Transport and Maritime Economy ever since.
The Council is represented by and acts through The Secretariat of Road Safety Council, which is located in the
MTME. The Secretariat deals with recommendations of measures, preparation of materials, organization of
sessions and current cooperation with all bodies active in the area of Road Safety.
2.1.2.  Actvities of the Road Safety Council
Actions of the Council have focused mainly on creating administrative framework at both national and local
levels, coordinating and streamlining road safety activities implemented by various institutions and widespread
promotion and increasing of the road safety awareness in the society. Basis for the activities of the Road Safety
Council were set out in 1996 in the Integrated Program for the Improvement of Road Safety in Poland -
GAMBIT prepared by Joint Authors Team led by Gdansk Technical University. In that context several tasks
aimed at establishing foundations road safety improvement in national magnitude were undertaken.
In each of 49 former Voivodships Provincial Road Safety Councils have been established and Communal Road
Safety Units and Road Safety Councils in Presidential cities started to operate under their authority. The new
country administration division since January 1, 1999 resulted in the necessity to reactivate and adjust the
structure accordingly.
Implementation of the Road Safety Component and establishment of the Road Safety Council at MTME enabled
to obtain financial support of polish Government. An amount of USD 2 million equivalent was allocated from
the State Budget as a kind of "special fund" set up purposefully for financing of the Council's actions (by means
of annual allocations). These budgetary resources accompanying the Loan were used to promote the concept of
Road Safety by supporting initiatives in the following areas:
*  patronage over publicity and information campaigns, preparation and distribution of educational materials;
*  sponsorship of conferences, seminars and public ceremonies;
*  commissioning and financing of studies and research works;
*  financial support to NGOs and foundations organizing competitions on various aspects of road safety
addressed to minors
The Road Safety Council has also played important part in implementation and promotion of the Black Spots
Program launched in 1998. The Council is also present in several international bodies and associations dealing
with road safety: ECMT, OECD, Nordic Road Safety Council and, last but not least, Global Road Safety
Partnership under the auspices of World Bank.
2.2.   Procurement of equipment for the Road Police
On 11 May 1994 the Road Safety Council approved and recommended for implementation a list of the most
urgent needs of the Road Police regarding procurement of road safety equipment. Financing of the equipment
was to come from the Project. On 25 October 1994 the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Economy decided to
allocate 3 MUSD under the Loan for this purpose.

In the meantime Police authorities prepared technical and operational specification for the equipment and
expected results of its application in daily operations of road brigades.
On 19 December 1995 the Minister of Transport and Maritime Economy, the Minister of Internal Affairs and the
Chief Commander of Police signed an agreement on cooperation in implementation of the road safety
component under the Loan. Thereunder, on 29 December 1995 issued a decision establishing obligations of units
involved in procurement of the equipment. The decision called for procurement of the following equipment in
1996:
*  50 microcomputers,
*  60 terminals,
*  50 speed radars hand gun type,
*  50 electronic sobriety testers,
*  50 accident site securing kits,
*  50 pcs. of equipment for disclosing and recording road safety offences on magnetic medium,
*  8 pcs. of equipment for disclosing and photo-recording red light violations.
After initial tenders it was found that generated considerable savings enable to procure additional 75 pcs. of
equipment for disclosing and recording road safety offences on magnetic medium (video-radars). Remaining
funds under USD 3 mnillion allocation were used to procure 4 vehicles for Police training center in Legionowo.

2.2.   Procurement of Technical Assistance and training
- 31 -



Apart from the actions of the Road Safety Council listed above, in view of improving the ability of GDDP to
deal with the problem of safety on roads it was decided to procure various appliances and Loan proceeds in the
amount of USD 2 million have been allocated to the purpose of the Road Safety Component within MTME. In
specific terms the following equipment has been procured:
*  150,000 reflecting road studs have been supplied and installed by ROAD SERVICE for the contract amount
of USD 560,024.43. The contract was signed on May 31, 2000.
*  26 weather stations have been supplied by SIGNALCO and installed as part of road weather information
system for the contract amount of USD 650,433.51.
*  30 salt spreaders have been supplied by EPOKE for the contract amount of USD 520,647.00, signed on
march 30, 1999.
Additionally, the following events were financed or co-financed as part of training under the MTME Road
Safety Component:
*  ECMT Seminar in J6zef6w on October 2 and 3, 1997 for the amount of USD 32,146.65;
*  participation of the Secretary of RSC in a Road Safety Conference in Pretoria in 1999 for the amount of
USD 2,500.00.
2.3.   Reducing the number of accidents
The activities described above were indented to diminish the number and mitigate the aftermath of road
accidents. Although the overall figure of accidents rose by 12,69% between 1993 and 1999, which was
unavoidable given a heavy growth of motorization by over 38% and the increase in share of passenger cars
64,87% to 71,21%. Due consideration must be given to the fact that the number of accidents is steadily
decreasing sincel997 and the rate of fatalities shows the same course (see figure 1 below and attached table).
Preliminary data for the first half of 2000 prove those diminishing trends are maintained with a total of 26,051
accidents and 2,269 fatalities.

Equipment procured for the road Police enabled to intensify controls of traffic though application of most
modern devices and in many cases reduced the time needed to respond to road accidents or incidents.
Thanks to procurement of breath analyzers Police was able to launch regular checks of road users behavior and
disclose drinking-and-driving offenders. Application of intensified and concerted efforts in this respect gave
fruits in systematic decrease of accidents involving alcohol in last three years (1997 - 12,426; 1998 - 10,956;
1999 9,319).

Ex-post evaluation of application of viedeo-radars in operating units (JAI made video-radars were put into
service gradually between end of August and end of October) concluded that as of 12 November 1998 (so very
shortly after delivery) total distance travelled by vehicles wih vedeo-radars was 488,651 km. During this time
18,512 penalty notices were issued for the total amount of PLN 2,906,710 and in 632 cases court actions were
initiated.
The following table shows recorded accidents in 1997-1999:

Causes of road accidents do not change too much. Principal causes again include: speeding, right of way
violation and incorrect maneuvers (passing, overturning). Thanks to the equipment Police is now able to record
dangerous behavior of road users. Information campaign, which supported application of the equipment
evidently disciplined drivers and resulted in decrease in number of accidents caused by drivers.

Procurement of road accident securing kits largely increased safety of Police officers operating on sites of
accidents through adequate signing and marking of the sites.
3.     PROBLEMS AND LESSONS LEARNT
Because of numerous duties regarding implementation of the Project and related commitments of various nature
incumbent upon the Secretariat of the Road Safety Council, the initial staff (two persons), although well
qualified, proved very soon to be insufficient and unable to complete all of the required tasks on time. As a
consequence certain delays occurred in implementation of the Road Safety Component
Although the Secretariat, despite many efforts, did not succeed in increasing its personnel throughout the live of
the Loan, on October 16, 2000 the Unit status was upgraded to Department staffed by eight people including 5
civil servants, 2 local experts and one International Road Safety Coordinator.
4.   BORROWER AND BANK PERFORMANCE
The Road Safety Council is very appreciative for assistance, advice and cooperation extended by the Bank
during the implementation of the Project. Supervising missions of WB experts were an opportunity to distribute
numerous comments and recommendations to concerned politicians, Government and Parliament members and
representatives of local administration and played major part in increasing the nation wide road safety
awareness. The outcome was a substantial extension, reinforcement and tightening of cooperation with NGOs,
research institutes, foundations and other bodies involved, which in turn contributed to achievement of additional
fall in number of casualties between 1998 and 2000.
Contribution of WB staff and resources made available under the Loan have largely fostered various
developments in the area of road safety. In line with the provisions of the Loan Agreement budgetary
expenditures for the road safety have been secured and together with Bank's financing will continue to support
the required improvements of road safety under the Roads II Project.

COMBINED TRANSPORT COMPONENT
EXECUTING AGENCY - MTMEIPKP
1.     PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Following recommendations of the transport system study implemented under the First Transport Project a pilot
program for combined transport development was included as the third and final component under the loan. The
idea of the pilot program was to establish organizational structure, which on a daily basis would deal with the
combined transport and act in the capacity of marketing and sale agent for existing transport companies.
Consequently on 17 November 1992 Combined Transport Association "Polkombi" S.A. was registered. The
component was to support Polkombi through technical assistance (procedures for operations, quality control
plan, standard contracts for assignments, quality standards and liability in operations) and procurement of
equipment (for terminals mainly). For this purpose an amount of USD 2 million was allocated (USD 1,500,000
for goods and USD 500,000 for technical assistance).
2.     ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Since Polkombi was a joint stock company there was a need to agree on the on-lending conditions for the
available funds. Several drafts of the on-lending agreements were prepared, however one issue was not settled -
a form of collateral for funds to be onlent. In the meantime Polkombi proposed new allocation of the funds: (a)
procurement of equipment USD 1,650,000 (a gantry crane, terminal development, swap bodies, container
cleaning facility), (b) technical assistance USD 350,000.
The proposal proved economically not viable and Polkombi suggested to use available funds only for
procurement of pocket wagons (24 pocket wagons to be used in block trains between Duisburg and Pruszk6w;
Udine and Gliwice). Procurement of pocket wagons found strong support in PKP, which due to shortage of funds
limited purchases of specialized rolling stock. In March 1996 Polkombi submitted to MT&ME legal opinion on
possibilities to establish collateral for funds to be onlent. All Polkombi's options were rejected and the Ministry
decided to onlent funds to PKP.
In November 1997 PKP produced cost and benefit analysis for the procurement of pocket wagons and in May
1998 related Business Plan (priority was given to relation Pruszk6w - Duisburg). In March 1998 the Bank
approved draft onlending agreement with PKP for USD 2 million. The Agreement was signed on 9 June 1998.
ICB was organized by FERPOL (trade office of PKP) and the contract for delivery of 33 pocket wagons with a
consortium TABOR POLSKI was signed on 30 June 1999. The following table gives details on the contract.

Wagons were delivered in stages between 8 February and 30 June 2000 and subsequently used by PKP Cargo in
relations to Germany, Austria and Italy. Between February and September 2000 38 wagons made 320 round trips
which gives a turnaround factor of 8.42 per wagon on average. Wagons are used to transport semi-trailers and
- 34 -



swap bodies only in international traffic to Duisburg and Hamburg (147 round trips), Villach and Vienna (93
round trips), Udine and Verona (80 round trips). Average loading factor for a wagon is 11 t per swap bodies and
32 t per semi-trailers.
Results of first months of use showed significant increase in transport of semi-trailers. Previously Gliwice
terminal only occasionally served such traffic (one semi-trailer a month). Currently discussions are held to
provide a block train (for semi-trailers) connection between Brzesc (eastern border) and Rzepin (western
border)/. Additionally PKP used own funds to procure another 30 wagons of that type. Operations are supported
by large-scale promotions and information campaigns targeting international and local combined transport
operators and forwarders.
3.     PROBLEMS AND LESSONS LEARNT
Implementation of this last minute component encountered numerous constraints and problems. Institutional
issues played major role in delaying implementation until last year of availability of funds. Lack of commitment
and clear responsibility for the pilot program remained major issue throughout the Project's life. We feel that
most of the issues might have been avoided if only institutional issues were settled at the appraisal.
Nevertheless, procurement of pocket wagons by PKP (although not considered during appraisal) brought very
positive results as far as development of combined transport operations is concerned.
4.   BORROWER AND BANK PERFORMANCE
We compliment actions of the World Bank missions and in particular Enn Vasur, his successor Graham Smith,
not to mention Luis Revuelta, who all personally got involved in execution of this component. Unfortunately
their Borrower's counterparts failed to meet this high standard.
