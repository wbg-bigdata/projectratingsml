                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is approaching closure: all loan proceeds have already been disbursed but implementation of a few remaining activities will continue till June 30, 2013. Almost 148 km of

                         new component - have been rehabilitated. As a result water losses in the selected main canals were reduced from 114 million cubic meters (MCM) to 17 MCM under the original
                         Project and from about 40 MCM to 6 MCM under AF and in tertiaries from 14.5 MCM to 4.9 MCM. Works on the remaining sections of tertiaries will be completed by June 30, 2013.
                         As of mid-May 2013, rehabilitation activities created 17,135 man-months compared with the target of 16,000 man-months. The value of wages paid to construction workers up until
