                         2011, is proceeding well with almost 89% of the loan proceeds already disbursed. Given that rehabilitation activities envisaged under the project could only be carried out during the
                         irrigation off-season, from November to May, advanced procurement was implemented prior to project effectiveness. Currently, construction works are on-going under both
                         components of the project on all identified sections of the main, as well as the tertiary canals (new component). Almost 31 km (in addition to 89.5 km under the original project) out of
                         the planned 50 km - 61.2% - of the main canals' sections and more than 39 km out of the planned 50 km (revised from 63) of tertiary canals (new component) - 78.2% - have been

                         rural project areas. This is compared with the target of 7,000 man-month temporary jobs. The procurement of a consulting firm for carrying out feasibility study and revisions of EMP
                         and RPF for the Meghri Gravity Scheme to be included under the new irrigation project - Irrigation Systems Enhancement Project (ISEP), has been completed and the contract has
