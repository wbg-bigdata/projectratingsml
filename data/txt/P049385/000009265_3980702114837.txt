A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
As in most Indian states, development expenditure in Andhra Pradesh (AP) has been crowded out in the last 15 years by costly
and poorly targeted subsidies, by a rapidly expanding civil service and by interest payments. As a result, critical public
spending on social development and the maintenance of the essential irrigation and road networks has fallen far short of the
state's needs. This is a major reason for the low level of social development in the state, the high incidence of poverty and the
relatively slow rate of economic growth.
As a result, most social development indicators in AP are below the national average. Infant mortality rate is 73 (per thousand
of live births). Population below the poverty line is almost 30 percent. Malnutrition among children aged 0-6 years is
estimated at about 30 percent. The literacy rate is only 44 percent, significantly lower than the national average. At 33 percent,
the female literacy rate is one of the country's lowest. The poor health and educational status of the population is largely
explained by declining budgetary allocations for these services. From 1986-87 to 1997-98, total combined public expenditure
on health and education declined from 4.7 percent of state's gross state domestic product (GSDP) to 3.6 percent.
Against this background, the AP Economic Restructuring Project (APERP) would provide resources to meet priority needs in
human development (nutrition, primary health and primary education) and in the maintenance of economic assets affecting the
rural poor (irrigation, rural roads and core access roads). This investment would be linked to a program of fiscal reform aimed
at bringing about a permanent shift in public expenditure towards these priorities, while maintaining tight control over total
public expenditure and debt. This shift is essential if the state is to increase its growth rate and to maintain the capacity to
finance much-needed human development programs in the longer term. The link between the proposed investments and the
fiscal reform p:rogram would be established by means of covenanted fiscal benchmarks to be monitored throughout the project
period. Specific sectoral objectives and key performance indicators are as follows:
Nutrition. Objective: to improve the nutrition and health of young children, women (particularly pregnant and lactating
mothers) and adolescent girls by increasing the quality and cost-effectiveness of the Integrated Child Development Services
(ICDS) prograim in the State. Key performance indicators: reduction in the prevalence of severe malnutrition among children
aged 0-6 years from the current 6 percent to less than 4 percent by project end; and reduction in the prevalence of moderate
malnutrition among children aged 0-6 years from the current 24 percent to less than 18 percent.
Primav Hea lilk Objective: to improve the health status of the population in the State through improvements in the quality and
coverage of services in selected Primary Health Centers (PHC). Key performance indicators: increase in outlay for supply of
drugs, institutional deliveries, outpatient attendance; adoption and implementation of staffing norms at upgraded PHCs;
establishment of project management unit; number of institutions utilizing Health Management Information System (HMIS);
training of medical and paramedical staff; and NGO and community-based activity in tribal areas.
Primary Education. Objective: to assist the Government of AP (GOAP) to build and strengthen institutional capacity in the
State to ensure that more children, especially from socially disadvantaged groups, complete a five-year primary education cycle
of appropriate quality in districts with a low level of literacy. Key performance indicators: increase in enrollment rate to 90
percent of the 5 to 9 year old children; reduction in overall drop-out rate from about 50 to 10 percent; increase in the average
achievement levels; and reduction in differences in these indicators among gender and other social groups to less than 5
percent.
Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance. Objectives: to improve the quality of life of the rural population through provision of
basic all-weather road access to villages in the three selected districts; and to improve the management of road maintenance
throughout the State. Key performance indicators: completion and continued maintenance of all-weather road access to about
1.5 million people in the three selected districts; corresponding reduction in vehicle operating costs.
IrTigation Rebabilitation and Maintenance. Objectives: to place the irrigation sector on a sustainable basis through involvement
of farmers in irrigation management and cost recovery; to reverse the decline in the State's irrigated area that has resulted from
past poor maintenance and management; and thereby to improve the productivity of irrigated agriculture. Key performance
indicators: 70 percent of Water Users' Associations (WJUA) functioning by the end of the project period; strengthened cost
recovery for O&M; expansion of effectively irrigated areas on existing systems; yield increase in irrigated crops.
Public Enterprise Reform. Objective: to reduce the fiscal burden of public enterprises and cooperatives by supporting GOAP
in implementing the first phase of reforms and strengthening institutional capacity to design and implement further public

enterprise reforms. Key performance indicators: privatization (bringing to the point of sale) and/or closure of 12 companies in
the Phase I Action Plan; preparation of a Phase II Action Plan; and improvement of institutional capacity for privatization.
State Finances. Objectives: to maintain a stable debt/GSDP ratio; to improve the development impact of public expenditure by
shifting its focus towards the social sectors and operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditure; and to enhance revenue
mobilization. Key performance indicators: lower fiscal deficit, significant change in expenditure composition in favor of social
sectors and O&M, lower untargeted subsidies, smaller and more efficient public sector, and improved delivery of essential
social services.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 17241-IN   Date of latest CAS discussion: January, 1998
Reducing malnutrition, increasing the level of educational achievement, improving access to and quality of health services,
reversing the deterioration in inrigation and roads, and putting state finances on a sustainable path, are all identified goals in the
CAS. The proposed operation would be a coordinated effort to meet these goals in one reforming state. As such it would also
support a key strategic objective of the CAS, which is to focus Bank resources on states that have embarked on a
comprehensive program of economic and structural reform. The CAS aims to initiate 2-3 such programs in selected states in
India over the next two years to support this objective. APERP would be the first of these operations, supporting the State of
AP, which is not only among the poorest states in India but which has emerged as one of the leading reforming states in the
past 3 years.
2. Main Sector Issues, Government Strategy and Issues to be Addressed by the Project:
AP's sector and fiscal reforms were reviewed and the policy agenda was discussed in a Bank Report "Andhra Pradesh: Agenda
for Economic Refoms" (Report No. 15901-IN, January 16, 1997). The main sector and fiscal issues addressed by APERP are
based on the policy dialogue facilitated by this report.
Nutrition. Since the Third Five-Year Plan, India has consistently accorded high priority to reducing malnutrition. A National
Nutrition Policy, approved in 1993, sets forth a comprehensive, multi-sector strategy to reduce poverty, unemployment, and
malnutrition, which includes - besides ICDS - food subsidies via the Public Distribution System (PDS), school feeding
programs, food-for-work programs, poverty alleviation efforts and health programs. In spite of this, malnutrition remains a
fundamental problem throughout India, affecting child development and educational achievement and impacting on the health
services and on the productive potential of the population. In the public sector, nutrition efforts are seriously under-funded, a
situation made worse by inefficient use of funds. The focus of nutrition programs is overwhelmingly on quantity rather than
quality in nutrition spending, the targeting of beneficiaries is completely inadequate.
The APERP would address all the issues discussed above through support for the ICDS program throughout the State. Support
for this program was considered during project design to be the best means of reducing malnutrition in the State because: (a) it
focuses on young children and pregnant and nursing women; (b) it promotes a holistic approach to child development; (c) it
concentrates on the poor; (d) it uses community workers; (e) evaluations show it to be relatively better-targeted, more efficient
and having greater impact on nutritional status of beneficiaries than alternatives (for example, the Public Distribution System).
Primary Health. Health is one of the six priority areas identified in the Ninth Plan (1997-2002). GOI has determined that
public investment in health is critical for development and poverty alleviation in India. The Plan emphasizes successful
preventive and promotive activities, better control of communicable and non-communicable diseases, improved surveillance
and improved systemic efficiency. Significantly, the Central Council of Health and Family Welfare has noted the importance
of linking preventive and promotive care with selective aspects of curative care, which is provided at first referral hospitals. At
the state level there are serious issues limiting the effective delivery of health care. Management and institutional problems
faced by the primary health care system include: (a) a lack of coordination of activities undertaken by the Directorate of Health
Services (DHS); (b) a lack of coordination between the DHS and the Department of Family Welfare (DFW) in the delivery of
primary health and family welfare services; (c) a lack of managerial training; (d) a lack of strategic planning capacity; and (e) a
lack of autonomy of the PHC medical officer in service delivery.
Beyond the problems of management, systemic and technical weaknesses are found in the following areas: (a) there is no clear
definition of services provided at PHC facilities, and norms for clinical and diagnostic services have not been rationalized; (b)
the referral system at the primary level does not function well because of the low confidence of the public in the services



Project Appraisal Document                                                            Page 4
Country: India                                                                        Project Title: APERP
available at the PHCs; (c) the Health Management Information System (HMIS) provides fragmented information on a range of
health programs in the State, resulting in ineffective monitoring, irregular information flows and slow feedback mechanisms;
(d) the system for surveillance of major communicable diseases is rudimentary and suffers from inadequately trained staff, lack
of materials and equipment for data analysis and poor use of information for feedback, program response and policy
development; and (e) non-medical services such as procurement of civil works, drugs and other supplies, and financial
management and audit, are weak. In addition, public sector health programs have not performed the community outreach
functions as had been envisaged by the Government. There is a lack of involvement of the community, including with regard
to information on health and medical care, and there are few mechanisms which facilitate community participation.
The APERP would address these problems in a coordinated way. The project would strengthen the existing DHS structure and
the joint functioning of the DHS and DFW. The Strategic Planning Cell set up under the AP First Referral Health System
Project (APFF'HSP) would be merged with the Evaluations Cell presently under the DHS. The project would also strengthen
the PHC medical officer's authority to implement strategic improvements in service delivery at the PHC, and it would aim to
enhance the outreach function of the PHC to the sub-center and community levels, as was originally intended when the primary
health care system in India was set up. Emphasis would be placed on rationalizing service norms, improving the referral
system, improving health management information and disease surveillance and upgrading non-medical services. The project
would also enhance the outreach function of the PHC to the sub-center and community levels, as was originally intended when
the primary health care system was set up.
Primarv Education. Education is recognized by GOAP as a key component of poverty reduction. Low levels of educational
achievement are critical constraints to social and economic development. The priority for GOAP, as for all other states in
India, is to move rapidly toward universal primary education. As in many other states, the key issues in primary education are:
(a) poor participation (nearly two million or about 20 percent of children aged 5 to 9 are out of school); (b) poor retention and
low achievement (about 47 percent of students who enter primary school do not complete class 5); and (c) weak educational
management structures (high levels of teacher absenteeism reduce coverage of the primary school curricula to significantly less
than the mandated 180 days of instruction). In the early 1990s, enrollment in primary education began to grow. This led to an
increase in the teacher pupil ratio to an average of about 1:52 and to an acute shortage of schools and classrooms. As the
State's fiscal crisis deepened during the last decade, education's share of total public expenditure declined (to about 14 percent
in 1997/98), and the share of expenditure on elementary education also declined (to 40 percent of the education budget).
By supporting measures to increase Government revenues and efficiency improvements in the public sector, APERP would
allow a re-prioritization of state expenditure in favor of increased real per student expenditure on primary education.
Specifically, the project would: (a) address the issue of poor participation by funding improvements in physical and
instructional capacity and through community mobilization; (b) increase retention and achievement through Early Childhood
Education (ECE) centers, back to school enrollment drives, in-service teacher training, provision of instructional materials and
other quality improvement measures; and (c) strengthen management by empowering school committees to participate in
planning for (Ievelopment of physical sites and for improving the quality of education in their schools.
Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance. The key issues in the road sector in AP are: (a) inadequate funding for maintenance;
(b) outdated planning, programming and budgeting methods; (c) outdated design and construction standards; and (d) limited
implementation capacity, giving rise to delays in decision making and in project completion. More than 80 percent of roads in
the State are in poor condition, with only 40 percent of the funds needed for maintenance being provided during the last two
decades. The impact of this neglect has been especially severe in rural areas, where poverty is at its most acute. Of the 27,000
villages in A]', 11,000 are without all-weather road access and are cut off each year for long periods during the rainy season.
GOAP policy is to provide all villages in the State with all-weather access. Recently, substantial increases in funding for rural
roads have provided sufficient total resources for proper maintenance of the network. However, the underdeveloped condition
of the network and the weak institutional set-up for maintenance has caused diversion of maintenance funding to upgrading
projects. GOAP policy is clearly aimed at ensuring appropriate maintenance of a core rural road network necessary to provide
access to all villages, and at strengthening the capacity of the Panchayat Raj Engineering Department (PRED) to execute rural
road upgrading and maintenance, especially at the district level, through introduction of proper maintenance planning systems
and execution of works by contract.
The APERP would support this policy. Its major focus would be on road maintenance: (a) to clear the maintenance backlog on
a core network of arterial roads in three districts; (b) to upgrade and maintain an associated rural road network in the districts;
and (c) to address the weak institutional set-up for sustained management of rural roads by strengthening of PRED (staff
training, introduction of modern road management tools and increased use of the private sector for design, supervision and
execution of maintenance works).

Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance. In irrigation, state expenditures have traditionally been focused on capital
investrnent, allowing for little attention to maintenance and system management and minimal involvement of farmers. In the
40 years from 1951-90 an additional irrigation potential of about 2.4 m. ha was created in the State, and in the Eighth Plan
(1992/93 to 1996/97) expenditures on irrigation amounted to 24 percent of total Plan expenditure (second only to the power
sector). In spite of this, the irrigation sector is in serious trouble, and with it the entire rural economy. In recent years there has
in fact been a net reduction in the State's effective irrigated area, from 4.3 m. ha in 1992 to 3.9 m. ha in 1995. Currently, the
gap between the potential created and the gross area actually used for irrigation is about 40 percent. The critical issues are: (a)
poor maintenance; (b) low system efficiency; (c) limited user involvement; (d) weak links between the Irrigation and
Command Area Development Department (I&CADD) and the Agriculture Department; (e) inadequate cost recovery; and (f)
inefficient operation and maintenance (O&M) allocations (budgetary allocations are made on the basis of a uniform flat rate of
Rs. 147/ha, about 30 percent of actual needs).
GOAP is fully aware of these problems. A "White Paper" was issued in 1996 with a diagnosis of the situation and, after debate
in the State Assembly, a comprehensive reform agenda was adopted with the involvement of the people in irrigation
management as its central theme. It was decided to launch a state-wide campaign to launch WUAs, with parallel actions on
scheme rehabilitation, maintenance and cost recovery. Subsequent dialogue with the Bank led to a refinement of this approach,
culminating in a policy statement, "Reforming the Irrigation Sector for Sustainable Management and Development", which was
approved by GOAP in May 1998. This policy statement is the basis for the actions proposed under APERP. To date, the
following steps have been taken: (a) a three-fold increase in water charges was ratified in April 1997; (b) The AP Farmers'
Management of Irrigation Act was enacted in April 1997 providing for the creation and functioning of WUAs as independent
legal entities; (c) in June 1997, 10,292 WUAs were constituted, covering the State's entire surface irrigation area of about 4.9
million ha; (d) in November 1997, 197 Distributory Committees (DCs) were constituted; (e) a massive campaign was started to
make the WUAs functional: farmers' conventions and district level workshops with WUA presidents and I&CAD revenue and
agriculture departments followed by a state-level convention of all 10,292 WUA presidents were taken up in May 1998
towards building understanding and commitment; and (f) the Water Charges Review Committee (WCRC) was constituted by
Government Order No. 225 of December 8, 1997, providing a permanent body for annual review and recommendations on all
aspects of water charges and maintenance funding levels.
The APERP would support these new policies. In place of new construction, the project would prioritize maintenance,
rehabilitation, investment in hum an capital and technology. The priority would be to restore the productivity of existing
irrigation systems, ensuring their sustainable management by putting the sector in the hands of users and on a sound financial
footing. This would require: (a) follow-up support to make the recently created WUAs fully functional; (b) training and
extension support for WUAs; (c) investment through the WUAs to rehabilitate and maintain the systems; (d) continued
improvement in cost recovery; (e) improvement in cost-effectiveness of O&M through annual planning and review of O&M
adequacy and costs by the WCRC; (f) capacity building in public sector institutions to support these objectives; and (g) WUA
access to better agronomic and water use technologies.
Public Enterprise Reform.. AP has 39 public enterprises (PE) and over 60 cooperatives in which the State Government is the
dominant shareholder. They receive direct and indirect subsidies of over 1 percent of GSDP. In the past three years, GOAP has
taken important steps to reform the sector, including establishing a Working Group (WG) to recommend a reform program for
each enterprise and setting up a C'abinet sub-committee to review the recommendations of the WG and submit them to the
Cabinet for approval. The WG has already reviewed most of the PEs and cooperatives. Its recommendations include
privatization of several units, closure of unviable ones, and merger and restructuring of the others. Two companies have
already been privatized and four closed. Others are at various stages of processing. A. strategic options study for Singareni (a
large coal mining company) has been completed by consultants under DFID funding. The results would be presented to GOAP
in late May. A State Renewal Fund was established in 1995 to finance severance pay under a voluntary retirement scheme
(VRS) and other retrenchment benefits. Over 2,000 employees have already been separated under this scheme. Weaknesses in
the institutional framework for privatization and lack of resources to finance severance costs are two factors which are likely to
hinder progress in implementing the reforms in future. GOAP's reform strategy focuses particularly on these issues to
accelerate the reform process.
GOAP is adopting a gradual and phased approach to PE reform in order to build both institutional capacity and public support
for the reform process by demonstrating the benefits of reform as well as the Government's ability to contain and mitigate
social trauma that sometimes accompanies reform. Accordingly, the PE reform program would have three components to be
implemented over a period of five years: (a) implementation of the Phase I Action Plan which includes privatization (bringing
to the point of sale) and closure of twelve medium-size/small companies, and a social safety-net program for the affected
workers; (b) strengthening of institutional capacity to plan and implement the PE reform program under technical assistance;
and (c) preparation of the Phase II Action Plan for the remaining companies and cooperatives. APERP would support Phase I
through financing part of the severance cost. The social safety-net program and an institutional capacity building program

would be supported with technical assistance under parallel financing from the Department for International Development
(DFID) of the UK Government.
Fiscal Issues. With a population of 72 million, AP is one of India's largest states. Despite its rich resource base, economic
development has been substantially below its potential. An annual growth rate of 4.6 percent in gross state domestic product
(GSDP) in the past 10 years has been below the national average (5.6 percent), and correspondingly the State's social
indicators have also lagged. At 33 percent, the female literacy rate is one of the lowest in the country. The poor performance
is the result of large public resources being absorbed by poorly targeted subsidies and public sector employment. Until
recently, total explicit and implicit subsidies amounted to about 7 percent of GSDP, with power and food subsidies (two-thirds
of the total) being the costliest. Salaries and pensions amount to about half of total state revenue (8.3 percent of GSDP).
Expenditure on education, health, and essential O&M have fallen substantially in the past ten years. AP's fiscal problems have
been exacerbated in the recent past by the introduction of an enhanced rice subsidy scheme and full prohibition on the sale of
alcoholic beverages, both introduced in December 1994. The State's debt to GSDP ratio increased from 19.5 percent in 1991-
92 to 27 percent: in 1995-96, and interest payments rose from 12 to 16 percent of state revenue.
The new Government, which took office in December 1995, has taken several difficult decisions to reverse these trends,
including reductions in the rice subsidy and in public sector employment, partial relaxation of prohibition on the sale of
alcoholic beverages, introduction of a public enterprise reform which has so far achieved privatization of two public enterprises
and closure of four unviable companies, a threefold increase in irrigation charges and enactment of a Power Sector Reform Bill
which would trigger a series of reforms in the sector. These measures are summarized in Annexes 11 and 12. They were a
sharp break from earlier populist policies and a significant step towards redefining the role of government - reducing it where
it can be efficiently replaced by the private sector, and increasing it in essential public services such as primary education,
primary health, and road maintenance. As a result, the overall fiscal situation has improved markedly in the past three years.
The fiscal deficit has been brought down from 3.8 percent of GSDP in 1994-95 to an estimated 3.0 percent in 1997-98. The
revenue deficit and the primary deficit have also been reduced from 1.2 percent and 1.8 percent of GSDP to 0.3 percent and 0.7
percent, respectively, in the same period. The business community has reacted positively to these measures; AP has emerged
as one of the top states in India for location of new investment in the country. The economy has responded positively; the
growth rate of GSDP has accelerated to about 6 percent per year
GOAP's fiscal restructuring program for the next five years aims to broaden and deepen the reforms already introduced. The
objectives of the program are: to stabilize the ratios of debt to GSDP and interest payments to revenue, which would require the
fiscal deficit to be reduced to generate primary surplus; to change the composition of expenditure markedly towards growth-
enhancing expenditure and improve its management; and to strengthen revenue mobilization through tax simplifications, base-
broadening, adrninistrative improvements and stronger efforts at cost recovery. The specific measures include: further
reduction in staff in State Government, better targeting of rice subsidies; improvement in expenditure management; preparation
for introduction of a value added tax (VAT); and strengthening of cost recovery in irrigation. The annual fiscal targets and the
policy benchmarks are presented in Annex 11 and 12.
C: Project Description Summary
1. Project Cony7onents (see Annex 2for a detailed description and Annex 3for a cost breakdown):
The total investment proposed under the APERP would be $830 million. It would cover six components: (a) Integrated Child
Development Services --Nutrition (US$103.3 million); (b) District Primary Education (US$168.5 million); (c) Primary Health
(US$70.2 million); (d) Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance (US$179.5 million); (e) Irrigation Rehabilitation and
Maintenance (US$282.3 million); and (f) Public Enterprise Reform (US$26.2 million). These six components would be
financed by IBRD, IDA, GOI, GOA.' and beneficiaries. The Public Enterprise Reform component would also be supported by
a parallel Technical Assistance Grant of US$3.8 million from the Department For International Development (DFID) of the
UK govemment. DFID would also finance TA for the introduction of VAT, up to US$4.1 million.

2. Key Policy and Institutional Reforms Supported by the Project:
Fiscal Reforms, The fiscal targets for the project period of five years are to: (a) reduce the fiscal deficit by 0.5 percentage
points in the program period from the estimated 3.0 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 according to the following annual targets; 3.0
percent in 1998-99, 3.4 percent in 1999-00, 2.9 percent in 2000-01, 2.7 percent in 2001-02, and 2.5 percent in 2002-03; (b)
achieve positive revenue balance of 0.4 percent of GSDP in 2000-01 and keep it at least at that level thereafter; (c) keep the
guarantees/GSDP ratio at or below the present average 9 percent; (d) reduce employment in the State Government (excluding
primary education) by 1.9 percent a year; (e) reduce the salary/GSDP ratio from the estimated 5.3 percent in 1997-98 to 5.0
percent in 2002-03; (f) increase total combined expenditure in primary education and primary health from the estimated 0.9
percent GSDP in 1997-98 to 1.8 percent in 2002-03 (approximately 0.18 points per year); (g) increase expenditure on non-
salary O&M from the estimated 1.2 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to 2.0 percent by the Mid-Term Review (September 2000)
and maintain it at least at that level; (h) increase expenditure on capital outlays (excluding net loans and advances) from the
estimated 1. I percent of GSDP to 2.0 percent by Mid-Term Review and maintain it at least at that level thereafter; (i) improve
targeting of the rice subsidy by eliminating illegally held ration cards; and (j) increase the collection rate of irrigation charges at
least to 90 percent by March 2001. The project would also support institutional strengthening of expenditure management and

Country: India                                                                           Project Title: APERP
improving administrative capacity for introduction of VAT, both under technical assistance.
A Mid-Term Review would be held in the period following the AP state elections (expected in November 1999) and would
allow the Bank and the newly-formed Administration to undertake a fundamental review of the policy framework and of
specific measures needed to maintain the thrust of fiscal reform during the remaining period of the project. At that time,
GOAP would be committed to present to the Bank a detailed set of fiscal measures, and continued implementation of the
project would be contingent on these proposals being satisfactory to the Bank.
Prima  Education. Policy objectives include: (a) preparation of annual work plans and budgets; (b) reduction of the state-wide
student teacher ratio from 52:1 to 45:1 by 2002; and (c) deployment of teachers according to state norms, particularly in rural
areas. Associated institutional goals include: (d) strengthening mandal resource centers (MRC) and teacher centers (TC); (e)
training school committee members; (f) empowering school committees to enhance teacher performance and student
participation; and (h) improving staff numbers and quality in state and district offices.
Primary Health.. Key policy issues related to financing and cost recovery are being addressed under the APFRHSP. The main
additional policy objectives under the APERP would be to strengthen the primary health care delivery system and to integrate it
with the first referral health system. To achieve these objectives, the project would support the following institutional goals:
(a) establishment of an institutional structure to coordinate activities of DHS, DFW and APVVP; (b) establishment of district
health committees (DHCs) to coordinate and monitor all primary health activities at the district level and below; (c)
strengthening capacity for planning in the health sector; (d) improved fimancial management capacity within the DHS; (e)
strengthening and rationalization of the referral system between sub-centers, PHCs and secondary hospitals; (f) setting up a
health management information system (HMIS) within the DOHFW; (g) strengthening the disease surveillance system; and (h)
greater participation of community- based organizations in delivery of outreach services.
Nutrition. The central policy goal in the ICDS component would be to enhance the financial norms for ICDS training
throughout the State. Associated institutional needs would be: (a) a systemic approach to training needs assessment; (b)
increased training capacity for induction and refresher training; (c) revision of curricula, with an emphasis on technical
training; (d) extensive training for all field staff; (e) formation of quality improvement teams; (f) continuous social assessment
and impact analysis; and (g) greater coordination of services provided by different ministries and departments (Health,
Education, Nutrition).
Rural Road Up,grading and Maintenance. The policy framework for the roads sector is already being addressed through the AP
State Highway Project. This would be reinforced under the APERP with the issuance of a new Rural Roads Policy Paper. The
basic policy goals are to: (a) concentrate resources by defining a core network of rural roads based on district master plans; (b)
adopt functionaLl standards restricting black-topping only to roads where traffic has reached an economically justifiable
threshold; (c) allocate adequate funding for maintenance of the core network through rural roads maintenance (RRM) budget;
and (d) legalize voluntary land contributions for road construction. Associated institutional goals of the project would be to:
(e) set up an Inter-Agency Road Coordination Committee linking the Finance Department, RBD, PRED and other agencies
active in the sector; (f) introduce systematic road management; (g) strengthen PRED's contract management capacity; (h)
improve quality control, including the use of consultants for supervision; and (i) create community road associations for
development of non-core roads.
Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance. Policy goals in the irrigation sector are to: (a) strengthen revenue collection and
increase efficiency of operations for greater financial self-sufficiency for WUAs; (b) form a Water Charges Review Committee
(WCRC) to review and (eventually) determine water tariffs and to determine needs for O&M (timing of full autonomy still to
be decided); (c) agree on indicative targets for revenue collection by March each year; (d) introduce 15 percent beneficiary
contribution to rehabilitation works in areas covered by WUAs (this would amount to an average contribution of 8 percent
measured over the entire system); (e) prepare annual maintenance plans by March each year, and separate allocations for
maintenance to cover 100 percent of maintenance costs; (f) make progress (on a pilot basis) towards introducing volumetric
charges to be collected by WUAs. Associated institutional goals would be to: (g) support the WUAs, including state-wide
training of WUA officials, NGOs and Government staff; (h) strengthen I&CADD and Agriculture Department to provide more
effective technology transfer to small farmers through WUAs; (i) establish modern communication and management
information systems linking WUAs with district, regional and state authorities; and (j) carry out an institutional study which
inter-alia would determine further options for evolution of I&CAD and WCRC.
Public Enterprise Reform. APERP would support: (a) implementation of the Phase I Action Plan which includes privatization
or closure of 1:2 enterprises; and (b) preparation of the Phase II Action Plan for additional enterprises and cooperatives. Local



Project Appraisal Document                                                              Page 9
County: India                                                                           Project Title: APERP
institutional capacity would need to be strengthened to carry out both programs successfully. A technical assistance program
has also been developed for capacity building, which includes establishment of an implementation unit (IU) within the Public
Enterprise Management Bureau (PEMB). Supported with a core team and consultants, the IU would serve as a technical
secretariat for the Cabinet Sub-Committee which is responsible for the design and implementation of the PE reform and
privatization program.
3. Benefits and Target Population:
The benefits of the APERP would be heavily concentrated on socially disadvantaged groups and the rural poor. While the
whole State would benefit from faster economic growth, arising from greater fiscal discipline in the public sector, the primary
objective would be an infusion of resources into human development and into removing the key bottlenecks to enhanced rural
growth. More specifically, direct benefits and target population can be defined for the main components as follows:
Primary Education. The project would benefit approximately 7.9 million children aged 5 to 9 residing in 14 educationally
disadvantaged districts of AP, a state which stands twenty-fifth in literacy among 31 states and union territories. Socially
disadvantaged groups which have low rates of school participation and attainment would be the main beneficiaries, particularly
girls and SC and ST children. The potential benefits of improving the quality and quantity of primary education can be
summarized as follows: (a) economic: the strong positive correlation between primary education and economic achievement is
well documented; (b) poverty alleviation: differences in educational development across Indian states have been shown in Bank
poverty studies to be a major cause of variations in poverty; the benefits of increased access and retention in APERP would be
concentrated on children of the poorest families; (c) public health: health and family welfare surveys for India suggest that
across all states primary schooling of mothers is associated with reductions in child mortality of 40 percent, fertility of 25
percent and severe child malnutrition of 33 percent; and (d) cost reduction: documentation for the District Primary Education
Projects II (28760-IN) and III (30120-IN) and the Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Project 11 (30130-IN) demonstrated that
halving dropout and repetition rates would result in a reduction of cost per primary school graduate of around 35 percent;
currently, completion rates in AP average only 53 percent for the five-year primary cycle.
Primarv Health. A major benefit of the proposed project is that it would assist AP to put in place a coherent and effective
health system at the primary level and to complement the investments already made at the first referral level under the
APFRHSP. This would indirectly benefit the State's population as a whole by reducing mortality, morbidity and disability and
thus increase the earning potential of the poor. Improvements in management effectiveness, health planning capacity, and a
larger role for the private sector at the primary level would enhance the effectiveness and quality of services. There would also
be substantial post savings through the implementation of streamlined service norms and rationalization of services since
treatment for many conditions would now be provided at lower level facilities. In addition, there would be other qualitative
benefits which would have a significant impact on the health system at the primary level. For example, an adequately
functioning referral mechanism would improve the effectiveness of the primary health care level and encourage a greater
participation of the private sector in health care. Moreover, there are considerable externalities associated with reducing public
health hazards through improvements in the surveillance system for majority communicable diseases.
Nutrition. Direct beneficiaries of services at nutrition centers would be children aged 0-6 years, women of reproductive age
and adolescent girls from deprived households. The total number of ICDS blocks to be covered during the project period
would be 250 (108 old, and 142 new) out of a total of 330 blocks in the State. The project would cover approximately 25,000
anganwadi centers and would provide services to over 2.1 million direct beneficiaries. The potential benefits from nutrition
programs in India can be summarized as follows: (a) economic: impact of reduced frailty and mortality on labor productivity;
(b) poverty reduction: ICDS centers are mainly located in rural areas where over 40 percent of the population are defined as
being below the poverty line; (c) fbcus on women and children: the project would improve access to centers for around 40
percent of young children and pregnant and lactating mothers in AP; (d) public health: a study by the National Institute of
Nutrition across four states demonstrated higher immunization rates for children in ICDS blocks than in non-ICDS blocks.
while the health-seeking behavior of mothers from ICDS blocks in cases of common childhood illnesses was more effective;
and (e) educational achievement: studies of the impact of the ICDS program in AP and in other states show higher cognitive
development and learning achieveiment in primary schools, lower school dropout rates and higher performance in recognition
and perception tests.
Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance The main beneficiaries would be the population of 2,677 villages (estimated at about
1.5 million people) in the three selected districts which are currently not accessible by motorized transport during the monsoon
season. The potential benefits to be derived from the project can be summarized as: (a) economic: better connectivity with
national highways and lower freight and passenger transport costs, impacting fares, the price of goods, the marketing of

Country: India                                                                       Project Title: APERP
products; (b) improved quality of life for the rural population in the selected districts: access to education, health services and
commercial facilities; (c) economic integration: better access to jobs for rural population, better use of existing assets including
existing vehicle capacity; and (d) cost reduction: better value for money in state spending on roads through improved
contracting, management and planning.
Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance. The Minimum Rehabilitation Program would benefit all major and medium
irrigation schemes, with a combined total command area of 2.45 m. ha. The Recurrent Maintenance Program would benefit all
major, medium, and minor irrigation schemes, with a cornbined command area of 3.7 m. ha. Institutional support under the
project would benefit all public irrigation schemes of the State totaling about 4.9 m. ha. In all, the project would benefit about
2.45 million farming units corresponding to a rural population of about 12 million people, mostly poor. The potential benefits
would be: (a) expansion of irrigation in the command areas, resulting from greater efficiency of water use and reduced losses;
(b) agricultural intensification on irrigated land resulting from more reliable water supply and upgraded extension services to
WUAs; (c) more equitable distribution of water, resulting in significant poverty reduction among tail-end users; (d) improved
fiscal performance by the State, resulting from the hand-over of routine maintenance to WUAs, increased cost recovery and
more needs-based fiscal allocation for rehabilitation; and (e) improved sustainability, resulting from up-graded management,
planning and technical skills in I&CADD and the WUAs. In the longer term, progress towards more generalized
modernization of irrigation infrastructure and technology in the State would result from the pilot operation (Scheme
Improvement and Farmer Turnover), which would involve more intensive investment, initially on a very restricted area.
4. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
Overall Project Management A Project Management Unit (PMtJ) would be established in the Finance and Planning
Department, GOAP. This unit would be responsible for all interaction between the Bank and GOAP and for coordination
between government departments and other agencies responsible for project implementation. A key function of the PMU
would be to monitor the progress of policy reforms, fiscal and sector, that are fundamental to the successful implementation of
APERP. Except in the area of financial management (see below) the work of the PMU would be coordination. The executing
departments are all experienced in implementing Bank projects, and (with some considerable strengthening of these
departments) the day-to-day management of the project components would be in their hands.
Financial Management. The PMU would be responsible for providing consolidated accounts, including the accounts of all
project components. This would be a financial management function and not simply an accounting function. The PMU would
have a full-time financial management professional as Finance Controller, who would be responsible for managing the flow of
resources to the project components and for ensuring timely submission of withdrawal requests to the Bank. He/she would be
assisted by appropriate accounting staff and would provide guidance to Pay and Accounts Officers (PAOs) and the Director of
Accounts (DOA).
All participating departments, except the Primary Education Department, would follow the PAO system for making payments
and accounting. Given the scale of the investments, and the need to generate timely and reliable financial reports, the PAO
system would be computerized. The computerized system would be capable of providing component-wise and category-wise
expenditures, actual versus budgeted expenditures for the current period and to-date, the system would also capture and process
information regarding the method of procurement so that limits of procurement laid down in the procurement schedule are
properly monitored. The computerized system would, in addition, capture physical progress so as to map the financial data
with the physical data for measuring the performance of the project. The PMU would prepare and submit to GOAP and the
Bank quarterly Financial Management Reports in a format to be agreed with the Bank.
Flow of Funds, and Departmental Accounts. The PMU would be responsible for release of funds to each implementing
department. It would release funds on a quarterly basis, at the beginning of the quarter, on the basis of requirements estimated
by the implementing department. A separate budget head with appropriate sub-heads would be created in the annual budget of
GOAP to capture all project related expenditures. As regards the Primary Education component, separate project accounts
would be maintained by the AP State Implementation Society. Each implementing department would have a full-time finance
and accounts professional. He/she would be responsible for financial reporting, monitoring district/block expenditures, audit
follow-up, and funds management. Each department would submit monthly project financial statements to the PMU for
monitoring, consolidation and submission of withdrawal applications to the Bank. Considering the number of WUAs (in
excess of I 0,000) involved in the irrigation O&M works, which would receive funds in advance and submit expenditure
statements for works carried out by them, the Irrigation Department would develop a suitable financial monitoring system to
keep track of advances released to WUAs and expenditures incurred.
Audit. Financial statements for each project component would be audited annually by the Auditor General in accordance with



Project Appraisal Document                                                           Page I1
Country: India                                                                       Project Title: APERP
standards of auditing acceptable to the Bank. The audit of project accounts would include an assessment of the adequacy of
accounting and internal control systems, ability to maintain adequate documentation for transactions, eligibility of expenditures
for Bank financing. The audited project financial statements including a summary of SOE disbursements together with the
auditor's opinion on it would be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the close of each fiscal year. The audit
report on the Special Account imaintained by the Government of India would include a summary of SA transactions and the
closing balance held by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The audit report on SA would be submitted to the Bank not later
than six months after the close of each fiscal year.
Procurement A complete summary of procurement arrangements is given in Annex 6. All procurement of goods and services
would be in conformity with standard Bank guidelines, and procurement planning and advance bidding documents for all
components would have been agreed before negotiations. Each component would manage its own procurement in accordance
with provisions agreed during appraisal.
Fiscal Reforms. The Finance Department would be responsible for managing the fiscal reform component. It would
coordinate closely-with the other departments (Revenue, Irrigation, General Administration) to ensure that all agreed measures
are taken on a timely basis.
Primary Education. The component would be managed by AP State Implementation Society, AP Prathmik Vidya Parishattu
(APPVP). This Society, registered as an autonomous organization, is already managing the DPEP investment in 5 districts
being supported by the UK Department for International Development (DFID). Monitoring and evaluation arrangements
would include PMIS and EMIS reports, third party evaluation of civil works, annual review of district and state AWPBs, bi-
annual joint supervision missions by the Bank and GOI, and other district-based multipurpose surveys, including learning
achievement of class V students in the final year of the project, and other project research and studies. In addition, periodic
classroom observation studies would document the introduction and impact of improved teaching methods in schools in project
districts. The District Primary Education program (DPEP) Bureau of the Department of Education (DPE) at the Ministry of
Human Resource Development, GOI, would provide the necessary technical support.
GOI would make the proceeds of the Credit available to GOAP, and GOAP would provide funds to APPVP in accordance with
standard arrangements for devel.opmental assistance to the states of India. If and when the primary education component of
APERP was accepted as a CSS, GOI would make the proceeds of the Credit available on a grant basis to APPVP under a
memorandum of understanding to be entered into between the GOI and APPVP
Primary Health. The component would be managed by a Project Director located in the DHS who would coordinate all
activities of the DHS, the DFW and APVVP relating to the Project. He/she would report administratively to the Secretary,
Medical and Health. A Project Governing Board (PGB), including high-level representation from all relevant parts of the State
Government associated with the project would be chaired by the Chief Secretary, GOAP. Periodic review of the
implementation of the project would be done by a Project Implementation Committee (PIC), charged with coordinating
programs under the administrative purview of different departments. In each district, a District Health Committee (DHC)
would coordinate national health programs, family welfare programs and nutrition programs; the functioning of the referral
system; maintenance of equipment; training of staff; quality assurance; surveillance of communicable diseases; and the
monitoring and supervision of alll project activities. The DHC would be chaired by the District Collector and would include the
District Medical and Health Officer (DM&HO), DCHS, other district level officers in charge of national programs and
representatives from other relevant departments.
Nutrition. The Executing AgenciJes would be the GOI Ministry of Human Resources Development, Department of Women and
Child Development, and the Directorate of Women Development and Child Welfare, GOAP, which would also exercise project
oversight. Project coordination on the ground would be carried out by the Department of Women and Child Development, and
the State Project Management Unit (PMU).
Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance. The Executing Agencies in GOAP would be the Roads and Buildings Department
(RBD) for arterial roads and the PRED for connected rural roads. Oversight and policy guidance would be provided by an
Interagency Coordination Committee. RBD has already established a separate unit (APERP sub-unit) under the supervision of
the Engineer-in-Chief, responsible for planning, budgeting, procurement, implementation, coordination and monitoring of the
component. In addition, at Secretary level, an Implementation and Tender Committee (ITC) constituted by GOAP under
APSHP would sanction contracts based on the recommendations of the APERP sub-unit and facilitate high level Government
decisions whenever required. The existing divisions of RBD would be responsible for bidding and contract supervision, but
consultants would be used for detailed engineering surveys and designs. The PRED would establish a Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) with a management cell at PRED headquarters and one each in the three selected districts staffed with about 50

percent (125) of the current staff of the road wing of PRED in the three districts. The PIU would be assisted by a Project
Management Technical Assistance Consultant (PMTA). Design and supervision consultants would be employed for the
upgrading work. The maintenance work would be implemented by the PIU. A technical auditor would be employed to
provide feedback on the results of the maintenance component. For Financial Reporting and Auditing on the rural roads the
PMTA would assist the PIU to establish and maintain a computerized financial management system. The PIU would include a
budget officer responsible for the preparation of project accounts, preparation of SOEs and withdrawal applications. The PIU
would also prepare quarterly progress reports in an agreed format covering the physical and financial progress of the project.
Irrigation Relhabilitation and Maintenance. The Executing Agency would be the I&CADD, headed by a Principal Secretary.
The Agricultare Department (AD) would be responsible for all activities related to agricultural production. The Revenue
Department is responsible for the collection of water charges based on the irrigated areas assessed in liaison with the I&CADD.
Within the I&CADD, the Commissioner for Command Area Development (CAD) would be responsible for implementation of
the project. 'The Engineer-in-Chief Administration, Budget and Planning (ENC, ABP) would be responsible for the
coordination of the Minimum Rehabilitation, Recurrent Maintenance, and SIFT components. The Irrigated Agriculture
Intensification work would be implemented by the concerned district agriculture staff. Institutional support would be managed
by two new units: (a) the Project Monitoring Unit (PMU) coming under the ENC, ABP, responsible for setting up, inter alia,
the computerized MIS and satellite communication systems, and (b) the Human Resources Development Unit (HRD) coming
under the jurisdiction of the DG Water and Land Management Training and Research Institute (WALAMTARI), responsible
for the PIM awareness campaign and the training of I&CADD staff and WUA office bearers.
Public Enterprise Reform. At present, the Cabinet Sub-Committee for the Public Enterprise Reform has the responsibility to
implement the reform program. GOAP has agreed that, once it is established, the Implementation Unit (IU) would be
authorized to deal with the day-to-day implementation issues. IU would be placed in PEMB. It would have a core staff
specialized in public enterprise reform and privatization and would hire short- and long-terin consultants as needed. It would
also oversee the implementation of the social safety-net program by a local NGO. Operation of IU and implementation of the
social safety-net program would be supported under technical assistance funded by DFID of the UK Government.
Proiect Supervision. Each component of the project would be supervised by a joint GOI/GOAP/Bank team twice a year.
These supervision missions would be coordinated with the GOAP PMU and with the implementing department involved in
each component. At each supervision, a review would be carried out of financial and physical progress, procurement, audit and
compliance with legal covenants. On the fiscal side, regular monitoring of the State's fiscal progress would be carried out by
the Bank, and a formal review of the fiscal situation would be carried out at least once a year, to evaluate progress related to the
agreed benchmarks. The second of these annual reviews (in September 2000) would be a Mid-Term Review (MTR), at which
the progress of the entire operation would be evaluated and decisions made with regard to possible adjustments in funding,
management arrangements and the fiscal reform package. Before the MTR GOAP would submit its proposals for the use of
investment resources during the remaining project period, and it would provide details of policy measures to be enacted to
maintain the momentum of fiscal reform. The purpose would be to reevaluate the commitment of GOAP to the process of
reform. The Bank's continuing support would be contingent on the policy proposals being satisfactory to the Bank.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project Aliternatives Considered and Reasonsfor Rejection:
General Project Design. The dialogue with GOAP over the last 15 months contained a clear understanding that investment in
the social sectors and in the State's infrastructure is a necessary condition for rapid economic growth. At the same time, it was
recognized that setting the State's finances on a stable path was essential to the long-run sustainability of each of the sector
investments. This close linkage between fiscal reform and priority investment is the key to the design of the APERP.
At the outset, it was also recognized that the reform of the power sector was the single most important aspect of structural and
fiscal reforn in the State, and it was decided to proceed with the preparation of two operations in parallel, a Power Sector
Reform Loan and a broader investment loan, the APERP. Taken together, these two operations would make a major
contribution to modernizing the State's infrastructure and social sectors, and they would be fundamental to the restructuring of
the State's finances. It was clearly understood that satisfactory progress on each of these operations was a necessary condition
for proceeding with the other.
In designing the APERP, considerable flexibility was retained in determining the size of each component, which would be
dependent on the needs and absorptive capacity of each sector as they emerged during project preparation. The chosen sectors
were identified at an early stage, in light of on-going operations of the Bank in AP and of the priorities identified for the State

during the next five years. In the social sectors, it was agreed that support should be concentrated on on-going programs in
health, nutrition and primary education, where the emphasis would be placed on up-grading systems, reducing costs and
improving management capacity, all activities with a high institutional reform content, direct impact on poverty and a
potentially high economic return. In irrigation and rural roads, it was agreed that the critical needs were in rehabilitation and
maintenance, which have beenr seriously deficient in the past and from which very high economic returns could be expected.
During project preparation, extensive debate took place on the optimum linkage between the investment program and the fiscal
reform. The strategic choice vwas focused on how far long-term investment programs can be tied to fiscal policy conditions,
which may fluctuate over relatively short periods. The outcome of this debate, agreed by the Bank, GOAP and the GOI, was to
recognize that the APERP is a comprehensive investment program, which must be justified up-front by an on-going fiscal
reform program, and which must continue to be justified by the achievement of fiscal and sector benchmarks over time. The
Mid-Term Review would be a critical feature of the project, at which time the entire program would be reevaluated in the light
of the success of the fiscal reforms and the achievement of sector objectives. At the Mid-Term Review, there would be the
possibility of restructuring the fiscal reform program, of reallocating resources between components, or of reducing the rate of
disbursement. In any event, continued disbursements would be contingent on: (a) satisfactory progress to date in the
management of the fiscal reforms; and (b) agreement being reached on satisfactory measures for the continuation of the fiscal
reform program. This understanding is embodied in the legal agreements for the project.
Within the context of this overall project design, each sector proceeded with its own preparation and appraisal, focusing on
investment needs and policy/institutional reforms. The following paragraphs summarize the specific sector alternatives which
were considered during project design.
Primary Education. Technical alternatives considered for the education component included establishing Block and Cluster
Resource Centers to provide in-service teacher training and technical support to schools, as has been done in other DPEP I and
DPEP 11 states. However, lessons learned from the implementation of DPEP 11 activities in five districts as well as from the
UK-supported AP Education Project (DPEP PHASE I) from 1985 to 1995, favor establishing resource centers at the mandal
level and relying on teacher centers (TCs) managed by experienced headmasters for most follow-up technical support. The
possibility of maintaining the present teacher pupil ratio of 52:1 was also considered, but it was rejected as inadequate to
achieve quality improvements, which require the introduction of new teaching methods and continuous assessment of student
performance.
Primarv Health. One option co:nsidered and rejected was to build an additional 800 PHCs which would be needed to bring AP
up to the standard norm as determined by population alone. Building these additional PHCs (while reaching established quality
norms) would require an investment two-and-a-half times larger than currently planned and would not be sustainable in the
long term. Moreover, this would not be a cost-effective approach, since it would not provide for prioritization based on
differences in basic health indicators, the poverty level or the presence of the private sector. Other options considered and
rejected were: (a) strengthening PHCs only where doctors are present (those areas which have the greatest need are also the
areas which tend to be under-served by doctors); and (b) strengthening primary care delivery wholly through contracting out.
The availability and quality of private sector services is uneven across the State; the private sector is less involved in
preventive and promotive care; the capacity of the Government to monitor and regulate the quality of private services is
limited.
Nutrition. The following alternatives were considered: (a) better targeting of the food distribution system (PDS) to improve
nutritional status: this would not focus on 0-6 year olds, the most nutritionally vulnerable; (b) combating micro-nutrient
malnutrition: this has relatively low GOI interest, and the multiplicity of agencies involved poses a major barrier to effective
implementation; and (c) privati2ation of ICDS services: this was not found to be feasible beyond the current training role and
limited service provision from NGOs.
Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance. Roads are the only possibility of providing access to rural areas (other modes of
transport such as railways and water transport are not feasible). Therefore the main strategic choices concerned cost
effectiveness. At the outset, the option of improving all existing rural roads in the project area was considered, but this was
judged to be beyond the financial and managerial capacity of GOAP. A choice was therefore made to focus on upgrading and
maintaining a minimum core rural road network essential to provide all-weather road access to all villages.
Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance. The main options considered were: (a) to carry out the full rehabilitation of all the
major, medium, and minor schernes in AP; (b) to carny out full rehabilitation of only the most needing schemes; or (c) to carry
out a minimum rehabilitation program of the largest number of schemes possible with the assistance of the WUAs. The first

option was far too costly in the short run, and would provide lower economic returns than minimum rehabilitation. The second
option would likely result in widespread failure of many WUAs and would not satisfy equity requirements. The third option
was selected, based on minimum rehabilitation in all the major and medium irrigation schemes of AP and support to the WUAs
in minor schemes and progressive upgrading by the WUAs through their annual operation, maintenance and management
activities. This decision would in itself be highly taxing for I&CADD and the other Government departments, and a decision
was therefore made to limit the agenda for institutional reform in the short run while the ambitious support for WUAs is
successfully implemented.
Public Enterpise R-eform Restructuring of the AP State Electricity Board (APSEB) would be supported under the power
sector operation. APERP would cover the rest of the public enterprises and cooperatives. The alternative to the present
program of 12 medium and small companies selected by GOAP for privatization/closure at the initial stage would be a
larger prograrm which would include the larger companies such as Singareni and AP State Road and Transport Corporation
(APSRTC). The present design was preferred to this alternative because AP has very little experience in public enterprise
reform and privatization. With the experience gained during implementation of the present program and with public
support created by demonstrating the benefits of the program, AP would be in a better position in a few years to take on
more complex and larger companies.

3. Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design:
Primary Education. The primary education component has incorporated lessons learned from ongoing projects financed by the
Bank and other donors aimed at universal primary education. Specifically, it recognizes the importance of: (a) anticipating
enrollment growth and ensuring that it does not lead to an increase in drop-outs; (b) expanding access, coupled with
enforcement of attendance and abolition of child labor; (c) providing access to early childhood centers for younger siblings of
girls attending primary school; (d) community participation in micro-planning, classroom construction, choice of physical

Country: India                                                                            Project Title: APERP
inputs and designs, monitoring teacher attendance and other aspects of school management; (e) linking AWPBs to priorities
defined at the Mandal and community levels; (f) articulating the roles of head teachers, headmasters, TC and MRC staff with
district level authorities to better implement school policies especially regarding number of days of instruction; (g) bringing in-
service training and technical support closer to the school; (h) providing more focused, frequent training to teachers, MRC
coordinators, DIET staff and also to School Committee members and others critical to the successful implementation of project
activities; and (i) strengthening institutions that support management and pedagogical reform.
Primary Health. Lessons from the implementation of the two recent State Health Systems Development projects are: (a) the
importance of maintaining continuity in project management and the key project actors; (b) the importance of empowering the
Project Implementation Committee and the Project Administrator appropriately to ensure timely and adequate flow of funds,
especially when the project is implemented by a government line department; (c) the importance of strengthening management
aspects by providing greater autonomy with regard to management and supervision, adequate staffing of key project
management personnel and strengthening management procedures; and (d) the importance of paying attention to quality
through the development of staffing and technical norms, referral mechanism, clinical and management training programs and
the development of performance indicators prior to appraisal. Key lessons from international experience: The WDR (1993)
based on cross-country comparisons of burden of disease and other data, identified an essential primary care package for low-
income countries as one which provides five clusters of highly cost-effective interventions: prenatal and delivery care; family
planning services; management of the sick child; treatment of tuberculosis; and case management of sexually transmitted
diseases. The proposed project would focus on delivering a similar package of interventions adapted to the specific situation in
AP.
Nutrition. The design of the current project has taken into account a number of key constraints that have affected the whole
social sector portfolio in India, such as: delays in the appointment of project management staff; delays in release of funds by
the State Government to project authorities; inadequate provision of funds by the State Government for supplementary feeding;
a large number of vacancies in project institutions; poor quality and management of training; slow procurement; delays in
submission of audits; and insufficient attention given by implementing agencies to improving the quality of services. Over
recent years, numerous evaluations of ICDS have been conducted, and more specific lessons have emerged, as follows: (a)
better worker training is key to improving the impact of the program; (b) better coordination of health, family welfare and
nutrition services is an essential prerequisite for ICDS strengthening; (c) focus on the biologically vulnerable is critical; (d)
better monitoring and supportive supervision for the AWWs is needed; (e) pre-school nutrition is a key factor in early
childhood development and enhances enrolhment and impact of primary education; (f) all aspects of the program perform better
in states with greater technical and managerial capacity (e.g. Tamil Nadu). Program impact has generally been higher in the
more-advanced, southern states (e.g., AP in ICDS I) than in more backward, northern states (e.g., UP and Madhya Pradesh).
Rural Road U2pgradinn and Maintenance. The following lessons are reflected in the project design: (a) intensive inputs over a
manageable area are more effective and carry a wider impact than inputs spread over a wider area; (b) comprehensive master
plans for rural road development are necessary to increase the effectiveness of the investment; (c) commitment of the State
Government for the maintenance of rural roads is an essential element of success and sustainability, as is the preparation of
annual maintenance plans and monitoring arrangements; (d) a clear policy framework for sustainable rural road development
was lacking in most of the earlier projects and is now an integral part of the proposed project; and (e) coordination between
various agencies dealing with roads is essential, and a coordination committee for all road related matters in AP would be set-
up as part of the proposed policy framework.
Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance. Irrigation projects appraised before the India Irrigation Sector Review (1991) were
primarily enclave construction projects with minimal focus on irrigation and water resources management issues and minimal
farmer involvement, institutional strengthening, policy reforms or cost recovery. Most performed unsatisfactorily, as
evidenced in AP itself where the AP Irrigation II project was a chronic poor performer, exacerbated by weak initial project
design. The need for strong preparation and design and the need to tackle management and financial issues are lessons learned
by AP and embodied in the AP Irrigation III Project. Under the APERP, project design is based on detailed consultant studies,
and all tertiary level investment would be based on detailed walk-throughs with WUAs. Both AP III and APERP have drawn
significant lessons from recent water resources management projects (WRCPs) in Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Haryana. These
recognize that reforms are needed at the state level with the project assisting its implementation. The best experience in this
respect has also been incorporated from other countries such as Mexico. The most important features are: (a) the piloting of
WJUAs, (b) the engineering features of the WRCP rehabilitation programs; (c) the need to articulate state objectives and
expenditure priorities; and (d) the importance of up-front actions before project implementation, especially procurement
procedures for farmer implemented works and institution strengthening features.

4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Fiscal Reform Program. Strong commitment to the fiscal reforms is demonstrated by a number of measures taken in the past
two years. First, GOAP issued a number of white papers in June 1996 to inform the public about the pressing fiscal and sector
difficulties the State was facing. These papers were widely discussed in the State creating awareness of the issues and reform
options. Following these discussions, GOAP took several politically difficult measures to reverse the deteriorating fiscal
situation (see Annex 11 and Annex 12). Second, the Bank's Economic Report for AP was prepared at the request of and in
close cooperation with the state authorities. Full agreement has been reached with GOAP on the report's main
recommendations for fiscal and sector reforms (January 1997). Third, GOAP issued two policy statements to describe its fiscal
and power sector reforms to be implemented in the next few years. The fiscal program supported by APERP and the power
sector reform program supported by a parallel power sector loan are based on these policy statements.
Primary Education. GOAP has undertaken the following actions which reflect the strong commitment to the goal of universal
primary education: (a) initiated a comprehensive "bottom-up", micro-planning project planning exercise in all villages and
urban slums in the project districts; (b) promulgated the AP Community Participation in School Education Act 1998 to
empower school committees and local bodies for school improvement initiate the process of filling vacant teaching posts in
project districts; (d) undertaken studies to guide re-deployment of teaching staff to reduce the present wide variations in teacher
pupil ratios particularly between urban and rural districts which it would implement; (e) appointed core project staff at the state
and project levels; and (f) undlertaken many community mobilization and preparatory training activities as well as taken steps to
rapidly implement MRC and school construction.
Primary Health. GOAP has expressed its commitment to health sector development by furnishing a Letter of Health Sector
Policy Development as part of the APFRHSP, the key elements of which are being implemented. In addition, AP has
participated in several workshops organized jointly by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) and the
Bank on broad-ranging health sector development issues, and has developed this project on the basis of many of the
recommendations from the on-going discussions and dialogue.
Nutrition. The commitment of GOAP and other stakeholders to strengthening ICDS in the State is demonstrated by: (a)
extensive participation in project preparation by central and State Government officials, NGOs, academic institutions, field
managers and workers, local government representatives and clients; (b) GOAP willingness to substantially increase spending
on service quality improvement, as well as to expand coverage; and (c) commitment by GOI of about 28 percent of project
costs, a substantially higher proportion than for most Bank-fmanced projects in India.
Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance. In the framework of the APSHP, GOAP has already taken a number of initiatives to
revitalize the road sector. Regarding rural roads, GOAP is committed under the project to adopt a new policy framework for
rural roads. Project preparation was carried out in a very short time. All concerned persons, including politicians, planners,
engineers and government officials, are eager to implement the project, and GOAP has already started project preparation work
for upgrading the state of rural roads in the remaining 19 districts of the State.
lrrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance. GOAP commitment has been demonstrated over the past two years, first with its
candid diagnostic of irrigation sector problems in 1996, then by preparation of the policy statement "Reforming the Irrigation
Sector for Sustainable Management and Developmenft in May 1998 and by actions already undertaken to get the program
under way. These actions include passing the AP Farmers Management of Irrigation System Act (Act 11 of 1997) (FMIS) the
tripling of water charges, the election of state-wide of WUAs, the preparation of WUA and staff training modules, completion
of the first round of training for all WUA Presidents, and completion of joint walk-throughs of the irrigation systems with
farmers. Project preparation has also been rapid, involving detailed work by I&CADD and AD staff with assistance of
consultants and NGOs. The most encouraging feature has been the political leadership behind these efforts, including rural
workshops chaired by the Chief Minister and involving the combined efforts of the full State Administration.
Public Enterprise Reform. Measures taken so far show strong commitment by GOAP. These measures include: setting up a
Working Group (WG) and a Cabinet Sub-Committee to prepare a reform program for the public enterprise sector; approving a
'strategic options study" for Singareni (a large coal mining company); setting up a State Renewal Fund to finance the severance
payments; and completing privatization of two companies and closure of four enterprises.
5. Value Added of Bank Support in this Project:
The APERP exemplifies the comparative advantage of the Bank. The linkage of major poverty-oriented investment with an
overarching fiscal reform would not have been conceivable without the intervention of an outside agency such as the Bank. In



Project Appraisal Document                                                               Page 18
Country: India                                                                           Project Title: APERP
this particular case, the Bank received the full support from GOI for its general strategy of focusing its resources on reforming
states. The message is quite simple. Scarce Bank resources can be put to maximum effect if they are applied in a concentrated
way in support of state governments which have already demonstrated their commitment to reform. The linkage of investment
with reform in such a comprehensive manner is a unique approach.
Within the individual sectors, there are also circumstances, derived from historical associations, which give the Bank a
comparative advantage. These are (a) in Primary Education, the Bank has become the key source of technical support and
external funding for universalizing primary education in India; (b) in Primarv Health the Bank's dialogue with GOI over the
past six years has made it possible to engage in areas of institutional reform which are important to systemic and broad-based
health sector development; (c) in Nutrition, the Bank has assisted GOI and GOAP in re-focusing ICDS by a transfer of
experience from ICDS I and II and TINP II, and has encouraged innovation, decentralization and participatory approaches to
project preparation and implementation; (d) in the Roads Sector, Bank support has already enabled GOAP to focus on the most
cost-effective way to upgrade its highways and rural roads, by concentrating its resources on a core network, preparing
comprehensive master plans and improved quality control and contract management; (e) in Irrigation, the Bank has a large
portfolio of projects in India which provide an understanding of the issues affecting efficiency and productivity of irrigation
schemes and overall growth of the sector. The most recent sector work in Water Resources Management documents this
understanding and has been a key input during preparation of the AP State irrigation policy and the APERP.
E: Summary Project Analysis
i. Economic and Cost-Effectiveness (supported by Annex 4):
Each component has been subjected to economic and/or financial analysis. For roads, irrigation and public enterprise reform,
economic rates of return have been calculated. For the social sectors, greater reliance has been placed on more generalized
evaluations of the economic returns to investment in human resources, while project design has been focused on issues of cost
effectiveness.
Primary Education, Differences in educational development across Indian states have been shown in Bank poverty studies to
be a major cause of variations in poverty. There is evidence to suggest that the major gains in reducing child mortality, fertility
and severe infant malnutrition occur once the spread of education across the population has crossed a threshold of around four
years per person (AP is currently well below this level, suggesting the potential for major gains in the most critical indicators of
social welfare). Unfortunately, there have been no detailed studies of rates of return to education in AP since 1978. However,
at that time studies suggested rates of 13 and 15 percent for primary and upper primary schooling respectively. More recent
evidence of the strong relationship between educational and economic growth in India has been documented in Bank sector
work on Primary Education in India. This includes analysis of long-run data on rural households and a desegregation of the
sources of economic growth. Cost effectiveness criteria have been of central concern during project design. The guiding
principle has been to maximize access and to minimize repetition. There are strong indications of efficiency gains in the
delivery of primary education resulting from reducing the rates of drop-out and repetition (currently, completion rates in AP
average only 53 percent for the five-year primary cycle). The concern for cost-effectiveness is also embodied in the proposed
use of para-teachers, recruited locally on lower pay scales than regular teachers and under the supervision of the communities.
Evaluations of such schemes in Rajasthan in particular, and in Madhya Pradesh, have demonstrated the effectiveness of the
approach provided that effective training and supervision is given. In particular, teacher attendance of this cohort is higher.
Primarv Health, The background data for the analysis of potential economic returns to primary health care delivery are
contained in Policy and Finance Strategies (Report No. 13042-IN, 1995) and in New Directions in Health Sector Development
(Report No. 15753-IN, 1997). Specifically, for AP, assessments were undertaken during the preparation of the APFRHSP of:
(a) financia]L and fiscal impact, including an assessment of potential cost recovery mechanisms; (b) institutional capacity and
risks; and (c) performance criteria. Finally, the AP Burden of Disease and Cost-Effectiveness Study, which was undertaken
during the lpreparation of the APFRHSP, provides a detailed analysis of the cost-effectiveness of interventions by level of
service, and ranks them by the degree of cost-effectiveness. Most of the services which would be offered at the primary and
outreach levels under this project have been evaluated against those criteria and judged to be to be highly cost-effective. A
detailed exercise has been included in the PIP disaggregating budgetary allocations to the health sector and making it possible
to monitor future allocations to the different levels of the health system.
Nutrition.ik A recent study has attempted to measure the economic returns to the feeding component of the ICDS program by
assessing its impact on improving nutritional status (deaths averted and reduced levels of frailty) and the consequent effect of
this on aggregate labor productivity. This study, adopting an all-India focus, used survey data on the decreased prevalence of
malnutrition among ICDS beneficiaries and best estimates from the international literature on the effects on productivity of

Country: India                                                                          Project Title: APERP
malnutrition. Using conservative assumptions of income and life expectancy, and historical costs, the net benefit stream
resulted in an internal rate of return of 20 percent. Cost-effectiveness criteria were applied in considering whether the APERP
should support ICDS or other supplementary nutrition programs supported by GOI throughout the country (the Midday Meals
Program in primary schools and the Public Distribution System). The effectiveness of the former has not yet been assessed but
an evaluation of the PDS has been recently completed by the Bank and judged it to be inefficient, both in terms of targeting and
of cost. Analysis carried out for the proposed Bank-supported Woman and Child Development project suggests that the cost of
delivering one unit of food uncder ICDS to at risk groups is less than one third of that required by the PDS. The ICDS program
reaches a much higher proportjion of young children and pregnant and lactating mothers (who attend the anganwadi centers),
and it is better targeted towards more vulnerable groups than the Midday Meals Program. The ICDS program itself could be
more cost-effective if, instead of providing supplementary nutrition for all who attend the centers, it placed more emphasis and
resources on growth monitoring and promotion, and concentrated additional supplements to the youngest children and those
found to be growth faltering. This approach has been followed in Tamil Nadu, and a number of studies over the past decade
have demonstrated its greater cost-effectiveness in improving the communities' nutritional status. These principles would be
applied in the proposed APERI? nutrition component.
Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance. The rural roads component would comprise three types of road works: (a) provision
- of minimum standard all-weather motorable access roads; (b) black-topping of existing earth, gravel, or WBM roads for
accommodating current and future traffic where economically justified; and (c) major bridges with length over 30 meters.
Cost-effectiveness analysis was applied to basic accessibility road work. The number of rural population served per unit of cost
was used as the primary cost-effectiveness measure for assessing the benefits and prioritizing proposed road works. Cost-
benefit analysis was used for black-topping road works and the construction of major bridges; in addition, the number of rural
population served per unit of cost was also used as an assessment of benefited population. A total of 1.5 million rural people
would benefit from this sub-component at a total cost of Rs. 150.8 crores (US$37.7 million), or 132 persons per lakh
Rs.(US$2,500). The cost-effectiveness of these road works range from 50 to 180 persons per lakh Rs. The unquantified social
benefits, which are significant, are discussed in detail in Annex 4 of the roads appraisal document. For black-topping and
major bridges, quantifiable benefits were determined from savings in road users costs due to improved road condition and, in
the case of major bridges, to shortened travel distances for both motorized vehicle (MV) users and non-motorized transport
(NMT) users. The Bank's HDM-VOC model was used to determine the user cost savings for MV users, and a simple method
was devised to estimate the user cost savings for NMT users. Total investment for this sub-component is Rs. 101 crores
(US$25.0 million) for all three districts combined, covering 1,300 km of roads. The analysis showed ERR of 12 to 90 percent
with an overall ERR of 24 percent and NPV at US$10.0 million. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic viability of
this sub-component is robust.
Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance. The irrigation component has been subjected to detailed cost-benefit and risk
analysis. Full details are contained in the project files (Irrigation Component Appraisal). The overall economic rate of return
calculated for the irrigation component is 38 percent, a level not uncommon in major rehabilitation and maintenance programs.
There are significant variations between the constituent parts of the program. To provide an indication of this variability,
calculations were made for a representative sample of major, medium and minor schemes, including .the Nagarjunasagar major
scheme, Coastal Region (428,434 ha), a Coastal Region medium scheme (6,000 ha), a Telangana Region medium scheme
(4,100 ha), a Coastal Region minor scheme (100 ha) and a Telangana Region minor scheme (110 ha). The Coastal and
Telangana medium and minor schemes represent farm areas with the highest and lowest productive potential in the State. The
ERRs for these different schemes range from 34 percent for the Telangana Medium Scheme to about 100 percent for the
Nagarjunasagar major scheme and the Coastal Region minor scheme. Beyond these representative areas, the more intensive
investment in the SIFT pilot area was calculated to have an ERR of 25 percent. By piloting it during the APERP, opportunities
for further increasing benefits and reducing costs could be gained, and thus serve as an input into the next investment plan in
AP. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic rates of return of the irrigation component and for the sub-projects are
robust to wide-ranging deviations from the base case assumptions. The major risks associated with the component pertain to:
(a) less than 100 per cent operational success of the WUAs, a key building block of GOAP's irrigation strategy; (b) delays in
implementation; (c) slower than projected farmer response to the investment program resulting in delayed accrual of benefits
and (d) implementation inefficiencies leading to higher investment costs. Overall, the project is robust to these risks. An
implementation delay combined with 30 percent shortfall in WUA performance that would provide a reasonable assessment of
downside risks, still results in an overall ERR of 23 percent.
As regards cost-effectiveness, the most important strategy is the move towards full cost recovery for O&M combined with the
devolution of responsibility for planning and implementation to the WUAs including 15 percent contribution by WUAs in cash
or in kind to WUA level investments. For those works which would remain within the planning and financing control of the
I&CADD (for example, main system works) beneficiary sharing of O&M, combined with user representation on key decision-
making bodies, should also exert significant pressure on I&CADD to seek the cost-effective solutions and to prioritize in

accordance with potential benefit.
Public Enterprise Reform. The economic benefits of the severance program include the marginal productivity of the laid-off
workers elsewhere in the economy and the marginal productivity of the foregone labor cost of enterprises. The former is the
product of the probability of finding alternative work and the net income produced by such activity, taking into account:
employment attributes (age, skill level); labor market conditions; and location of the enterprise. The marginal productivity of
the foregone labor cost of the enterprise represents the opportunity cost of the outlays that would be saved by the program and
is estimated as equivalent to the annual wage savings to the enterprise from reducing excess staff. The costs of the severance
program include severance payments and the training costs. Severance payments include only the ex-gratia or incentive
component of the total severance package. Terminal benefits or legal entitlements (including gratuity, balance in the provident
fund, notice payments and earned leave) are not included. Training costs have been calculated on the basis of an average cost
per employee based on the national experience with similar training programs.
The severanlce program covers 7,246 surplus employees in 12 enterprises in the initial Action Plan for the PE reform for a total
estimated cost of Rs. 1 ,115 million including contingency of 10 percent (US$26.2 million). For the program as a whole, the net
present value (NPV) is estimated at Rs. 140 million (US$3.3 million) at a 12 percent discount rate, and its economic rate of
return (ERR) is estimated at 17.4 percent (using the standard conversion factor of 0.9). The financial rate of return is 35.3
percent with a payback period of 2 years.
2. Fiscal Impact:
The financial analysis of components of APERP has been focused on the project's fiscal impact and sustainability. The
following paragraphs summarize the analysis for the project as a whole and that of the individual components.
Overall Fiscal Impact. The budgetary impact of the project (i.e., local funds needed for implementation of all components)
would amount to 0.2 percent of GSDP during the project period and 0.3 percent after the project was completed. The main
contributors to this budgetary demand would be: primary education which would significantly increase the number of teachers;
food costs under the nutrition component; and increased budgetary allocations for O&M in the irrigation and road sectors
needed to raise norms under the project. The increased budgetary burden would be manageable in the context of the fiscal
reform program. It could be met entirely from the budgetary savings from rationalization of the rice subsidy and staff in the
state government, which would jointly constitute about 0.7 percent of GSDP at the end of the project period.
Primary Education. Primary education in AP is seriously under-financed and on a declining trend, and a meaningful economic
restructuring program must include a reversal of this trend. Between 1990/91 and 1997/98, education expenditures fell from
2.9 percent to 2.5 percent of GSDP. Elementary education receives around 44 percent of total education expenditure, which is
five percentage points below the average for the major states and considerably below the share in other educationally backward
states. The proposed project would have a total cost of US$168.5 million, of which GOAP would be responsible for US$3 1.1
million. Over five years this contribution would be relatively small as a percentage of current expenditure on education
(approximately 3 percent). However, as a condition for the project, GOAP has also agreed to fill all existing primary teacher
vacancies and sanction the additional posts necessary to reach, by the end of the project, a pupil teacher ratio of 45:1 with a
gross enrollment ratio of 90 percent in the districts covered by the DPEP - 14 new districts and 5 districts already covered
within the DPEP program. To implement this agreement would eventually add around 20 percent to existing expenditure, or
around US$39.0 million. Allowing for growth in the school-age group, an increase in the gross enrollment rate from 80
percent to 91) percent and a reduction of the pupil:teacher ratio to 45:1 in project districts would require a further 37,000
teachers, in addition to those being employed through DPEP I and II. This would add around US$44.0 million a year. In total,
by the final year of the project, increased teacher salary costs (outside of the project) would be around US$83.0 million,
compared to total elementary expenditure in 1997-98 of US$192 million. Achievement of this requirement implies a growth of
almost 8.0 percent in real annual expenditures during the project period, or three times the rate achieved in recent years. With
the expected increase in public revenue of 1.7 percent GSDP and the combined expected savings from reduction in salary bill
and rice subsidy of 0.7 percent of GSDP, this objective would be feasible.
Primary Health, A detailed analysis of public expenditures on health is provided in Annex 3 of the Staff Appraisal Report of
the APFRHSP (Report No. 13402). In summary, the public health care system in AP operates within the confines of a very
restricted budget. Between 1990-91 and 1997-98, total expenditure on health and family welfare fell from 1.2 percent to 1. I
percent of GSDP. Primary health constitutes only 10 percent of total health expenditure. The health component would have a
total cost of $70.2 million, of which $58.4 million is financed by APERP. About 30 percent of the total cost is recurrent
expenditure. GOAP's share of the total project cost is $2.4 million a year, which is about 10 percent of the total primary health

Country: India                                                                        Project Title: APERP
budget. Under the government fiscal restructuring program, expenditure on primary health is expected to increase from 0.1
percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to 0.5 percent in 2002-03 (see Annex 12).
Nutrition, Overall, the fiscal im]pact of the project on GOI would be small. More important would be the impact on GOAP
from increased food expenditures in the supplementary feeding program. The new centers to be opened during the project
would require Rs.62 crores (USIS 15.0) per year for food costs, on the basis of the GOI feeding norms. Since CARE has agreed
to maintain but not to increase its current allocation of food (about Rs. 12.0 crores), all of the increased costs would fall on the
State Government which currently spends around Rs.27 crores a year on this item. In addition, the State Government has
agreed to provide the funding required to fully meet the GOI feeding norms in all existing centers. The total obligation by the
third year of the project would be around Rs.125 crores requiring an overall increase of around Rs.100 crores (US$25.0
million). This would amount to a fourfold increase in state expenditure on supplementary feeding. The increased budgetary
burden would be manageable in the context of the fiscal restructuring program.
Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance. The project would have an overall counterpart funding requirement during the five
years of implementation for the State of US$66.9 million, of which US$23.0 million (about US$1.9 million per district per
year) would be earmarked for the rural road maintenance component in the three districts. Currently, annual available funds
for rural road maintenance amoumt to about US$2.4 million per district per year from the rural road maintenance (RRM)
budget. The balance US$43.8 million (or US$8.5 million per year) required for heavy maintenance of state roads and
upgrading of rural roads would also be arranged from the State's budgetary sources. In the medium-term, GOAP intends to
create a State Renewal Fund and fmnance it with an earmarked portion of the Vehicle Tax and the Sales Tax on fuels. This
would ensure a long-term mechanism to generate adequate funding both O&M and capital expenditure in the sector.
Irrieation Rehabilitation and Maintenance. The irrigation component would aim to eliminate dependence on fiscal transfers for
O&M by: strengthening the collection of water charges; reducing the budgetary costs of rehabilitation and maintenance by
devolving responsibility to the WUAs; and by expanding the net irrigated area through more efficient use of available water.
GOAP aims to achieve budget neutrality in the third year of the project. This requires significant improvement in revenue
collection from water charges. Over the project period, revenue collection from water charges is expected to be $96 million,
about one-third of the component cost. In addition, capital cost sharing will be introduced as a standard requirement for WUAs
from project initiation. WIUAs will contribute 15 percent of the minimum rehabilitation and the SIFT works within their
jurisdiction in cash or in kind.
3. Technical:
Primary Education. Achievement of increased participation and retention is particularly sensitive to the issue of teacher
availability and deployment as well as to the provision of necessary inputs. Previous experience in AP and elsewhere has
shown that enrollment growth in government schools cannot be sustained without increased investment in staff and physical
inputs and better community involvement in school management. Improving teacher:pupil ratios is critical to keeping children
in schools and encouraging them to learn. A second critical condition for project success, especially for improving student
achievement, has to do with the coverage, focus and quality of the instructional materials, in-service training and technical
support to be provided to schools. Changes in classroom practices and learning outcomes can be produced by comprehensive,
periodic interventions focused on new curricular, instructional and assessment techniques which can be readily adopted by
teachers working in poor learning environments. Finally, community and teacher empowerment is essential to the achievement
of project objectives. GOAP has made a good start by encouraging community and school participation in project planning,
devolving more responsibilities on to school committees. During implementation, this would need to be followed up by
training of school officials and community members and by ensuring that AWPBs reflect priorities established at the local
level.
Primarv Health. A multi-tier health delivery system combining preventive and curative care works efficiently when the various
tiers of the system are linked through a referral mechanism with clearly defmed norms of service. Under the APERP, norms at
the primary level have been defined, incorporating norms for reproductive and child health as well. This, together with the
norms for clinical and diagnostic services for secondary hospitals which were developed as part of the APFRHSP, would help
establish a coherent system of service delivery from the community to the district administration, with the district hospital
acting as the nodal point under which the system of secondary and primary care delivery would function. The PHCs in the
State are now being divided into two groups, and appropriate norms of service have been developed for each group: (a) 500
PHCs out of the State's network of 1,335 PHCs would be upgraded to perform enhanced services based on norms developed by
the DHS; and (b) technical norms for the provision of basic primary care at the remaining PHCs have been developed. About
450 of these PHCs would be strengthened under the project through the provision of civil works, equipment and other inputs.

Country: India                                                                        Project Title: APERP
The role of the paramedics at these PHCs would be crucial and would be strengthened by providing them with adequate
training and support.
Nutritio  The APERP would carry the potential for increasing the effectiveness of the ICDS program in AP by addressing
existing weaknesses, including: (a) improved targeting, focused on the under-threes and families most at risk; (b) improved
task and time management of front-line workers; (c) strengthened growth monitoring and promotion; (d) refornned
supplementary feeding programs; (e) improved collaboration with the health department; (f) rationalized purchase and
distribution of drugs; (g) improved referrals of malnourished children; and (h) enhanced pre-school stimulation. Important
innovations would include: adding creches to AWCs; total quality management; enhanced community participation; nutrition,
health and education inputs for adolescent girls; independent performance audits; and linkages with primary education.
Rural Road lJpgrading and Maintenance. In the past, quality problems have been encountered in road projects in India with
regard to surveys, pavement design, detailed engineering, contractor capability, workmanship, and strict adherence to technical
specifications. A major emphasis of the project is therefore the introduction of international best practice to the AP road sector.
The quality of engineering preparation has been addressed by appointing an international standard consulting engineering firm.
Bid packages would be sized, and qualification criteria prescribed, so as to be of interest to well-qualified contractors.
Construction supervision would be the responsibility of RBD engineers under the oversight of internationally-experienced
consultants. None ofthe ruralroadworks, exceptthe35 majorbridges (span largerthan 30 meters), require complex design
or implementation methods. The technical standard for the basic access roads is set at the level sufficient to ensure basic,
minimum road accessibility, which is defined as accessible by motorable traffic throughout the year with interruptions less than
12 hours per event and cumulatively less than 15 days per year. The technical specifications for gravel/WBM and BT are
recommended based on both traffic requirement and local implementation experience. PRED would be assisted by the PMTA
consultants to implement the project. Design and supervision of the upgrading component would be done by experienced
consultants. On the connecting state roads, the heavy periodic maintenance would not require complex design or construction
methods. Under APSHP substantially higher standards of project design, implementation and quality control are being
introduced.
Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance. Better water management would be generated by the minimum rehabilitation of the
irrigation and drainage systems and by improved O&M with the participation of the users. The technology required is
relatively simple, and a strong sense of ownership would be derived from the devolution to WUAs. Improved water control
would be made possible by installing measuring devices at the head of the distributory and minor canal systems and
proportional modules at the head of the chaks to facilitate water control to the Distributory Committees, the WUAs, and the
individual users. This latter measure would also contribute to better cost recovery by enabling I&CADD and the WUAs to
move to charging water on a volumetric basis. Annual planning of maintenance activities, monitoring of costs, and an annual
review by the WCRC would improve the overall effectiveness of O&M. The Scheme Improvement and Farmer Turnover
(SIFT) (on 1 percent of the project area) would pilot a higher level of modernization expected to be relevant for the next phase
of investment in AP. The more intensive modernization, leading to higher farmer incomes and water control, would be a
suitable investment for irrigation schemes managed by farmers. All minimum rehabilitation and SIFT works require detailed
diagnostics of the systems by the WUAs and I&CADD working together, including participatory walk-throughs of the systems
to define critical needs. On that basis, tailored rehabilitation plans would be prepared for each system and agreed between
I&CADD and the WUAs, including the works and cost-share (minimum 15 percent) to be borne by the WUAs. This would be
essential to ensure that the improvements responded to local needs and were cost-effective.
4. Insttutional:
Executing Aenies The arrangements for project execution (overall project management and separate component execution)
are described in Section C.4 above (Institutional and Implementation Arrangements). This section does not repeat those
arrangements but presents an evaluation of their effectiveness and points to areas of potential weakness.
Pimarm Education. There are four Project Management issues of particular concern. First, the continuity of senior national
and state prqject management staff is central to effective implementation. Frequent rotation of these staff often has adverse
effects on implementation as experience in DPEP I & II attests. Second, it is necessary to staff the SCERT, DIETs, MRCs and
other apex institutions responsible for training and curriculum development with highly motivated personnel experienced at the
primary school level. In AP, DIETs and the SCERT have been engaged in primary school improvement under APPEP for
about ten years and have recruited many qualified, experienced staff. Nevertheless, expansion to 14 districts would pose a
challenge as far as staffing is concerned. Third, to improve project effectiveness and sustainability, there is a need for careful
coordination of DPEP implementation structures at the district and sub-district levels with those of the Department of
Education. This issue is now being addressed directly by GOAP, particularly as it concerns the roles and responsibilities of

Countiy: India                                                                            Project Title: APERP
school inspectors, MRC coordinators, and TC staff for managerial and academic supervision of schools. Fourth, most DPEP
states, even DPEP 11 districts in EOPEP I states, have experienced slow project start-up. One cause is a hiatus in activity
between appraisal and effectiveness despite the availability of retroactive financing. However, GOAP has already made funds
available to districts for start-up activities, including MRC and school construction, which commenced in early 1998, and this
bodes well for APERP activities.
Primary Health. Specific measures are planned at the state, zonal and district levels to increase the efficiency of project
implementation, based on lessons learned from similar projects and institutional risks in AP. These include: (a) empowering
the PGB to facilitate interdepartmental coordination and to authorize the Project Implementation Committee in day-to-day
project implementation matters; (b) establishing DHCs to facilitate implementation and coordination of project activities at the
district level; (c) setting-up a mechanism to empower the Project Director to incur project-related expenditures; (d)
empowering the DOHFW in the implementation of the civil works program and equipment management system; (e) setting-up
a new drug procurement arrangenment which adopts, with minor exceptions, an open tender system, in which purchase orders
are centralized at the state level; and (f) setting-up a computer-based fmancial management system for use and operation by the
PIC which would be capable of providing timely and reliable information to the PIC to facilitate effective monitoring of the
project's progress.
Nutrition. Institutional capacity for nutrition in AP is substantial, having benefited from 7 years of Bank support under ICDS 1.
Further enhancement of Project Management under APERP would include: (a) creation of a PMU integrated with the existing
ICDS program office, and including additional technical staff for nutrition, training, IEC, monitoring and evaluation; and
financing of additional technical support posts at the district level; (b) implementing institutional development plans for
existing ICDS worker pre-service training institutions; (c) creation of additional pre-service training institutions to reduce the
training backlog and establishment of a new in-service training system at district and block level; and (d) reducing the
managerial complexity of ICDS, by allowing the State to adopt simplified schemes for women's empowerment and adolescent
girls, which fit their needs and capacities, and by focusing field workers on a limited number of priority tasks.
Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance. Limitations in the capacity of PRED, responsible for the rural roads, have been the
principle factor limiting the project initially to three districts. The PRED is responsible for implementation, not only of rural
roads, but also water supply, buildings and minor irrigation. It has a total staff of 17,700 people, out of which 5,100 are
technical staff (engineers), distributed hierarchically from the headquarters, to district level, and to division level operations.
Roughly half of the staff work in the road sector. Under the APERP, 50 percent of those would be dedicated exclusively to the
project. A detailed institutional analysis has been made in the framework of the preparation of the rural road component (see
Roads Component Appraisal). It is concluded that the arrangements planned under the project would be within the capacity of
PRED, subject to the substantial institutional strengthening proposed as a part of the project. As for the RBD, responsible for
the connecting state roads, the implementing capacity would be considered adequate, following the institutional strengthening
built into the project.
Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance. The I&CADD is already implementing a number of Bank-assisted projects and is
well familiar with Bank procedures. The extent and complexity of the proposed irrigation component in this project is such
that a dedicated PMU is essential for day-to-day management under the Engineer-in-Chief, Administration, Budgeting and
Planning. In order for the PMU to monitor all project activities and to maintain consolidated project accounts, dedicated MIS
modules would be prepared at the beginning of project implementation. The project would include strengthening of I&CADD
in particular as regards implementation of the WUA support program and the minimum rehabilitation and O&M program.
While no major staff restructuring; is envisaged at this stage, effective decentralized management would be needed. Intensive
training programs would be a feature of the project, not only for WUAs, but also for I&CADD staff, NGOs and for staff in
other departments such as the Agriculture Department. These activities would be coordinated by a newly created unit within
I&CADD, the Human Resources Development (HRD) unit. Significant consultancy support and study tours would also be
included in the project. In Project. Year 3, an institutional study would be undertaken to provide a basis for further institutional
change in I&CADD and WCRC.
5. Social:
Fiscal Reform Program. The social impact of fiscal reforms is expected to be positive: (a) faster growth arising from greater
fiscal discipline in the public sector; (b) expenditure in primary education, primary health, and nutritional services is planned to
increase substantially under the project and to remain at a high level thereafter, which would improve social conditions,
particularly in the rural areas; and (c) better targeting of the rice subsidy to the poor is a critical objective of the fiscal reforms;
measures to achieve this objective include: new multiple criteria to be used in both urban and rural areas to identify the
population below the poverty line, and women groups to be involved in monitoring the implementation of the reform program.

Prim, Ecation. Each village in the 14 DPEP expansion districts has carried out micro-planning exercises to generate
demographic data and information on the proportion of girls, schedule caste and tribal children attending formal schools,
alternative school or ECE centers. Information has also been collected on the number and characteristics of drop outs and
about the incidence, employment and educational needs of child labor. Analysis of these data has been used to devise
intervention strategies and prepare the first year AWPBs. During project implementation, targets would be set for improving
participation, retention and attendance, based on continually up-dated micro-planning data, to guide preparation of AWPBs,
monitor progress, and allocate funds. Insofar as child labor and girls' participation are concerned, the project would encourage
affected children to attend formal school through back-to-school drives, establishment of ECE centers, employment of teachers
from the community, and other interventions. AS centers are conceived as a transitional device necessary for eventually
mainstreami[ng out-of-school children particularly those involved in non-household, non-agricultural employment.
Prima  Health, A social assessment and a burden of disease study were undertaken in preparing this component. Several
issues were identified as responsible for the poor quality of services provided at PHCs: lack of on-the-job training for medical
officers; poor infrastructure facilities; poor HMIS; lack of motivation among PHC staff; lack of interdepartmental coordination
between health and family welfare departments, which resulted in wastage of resources; and poor outreach services, resulting in
decreased access of beneficiaries to primary health care services. Women are particularly impacted by the lack of access to
emergency obstetric care. The project would address these issues by (a) setting up a mechanism at the state and district levels
to coordinate programs of the health and family welfare departments; (b) providing timely access to emergency obstetrics care
through the strengthening of the referral system from the community to the referral hospital; and (c) targeting the poor,
particularly tribal populations, to increase their access to primary health services free of cost. A beneficiary assessment study,
undertaken as part of project preparation to identify the health care needs of tribal communities and constraints in provision of
these needs, recommends plans for delivering adequate and quality health care for members of these communities. The
projecfs tribal strategy aims to increase the demand for primary health services by improving the quality of services and
providing elfective IEC to better inform tribal populations of the benefits of using government health services. In addition, the
project would provide an incentive package to doctors and other medical staff to encourage them to accept assignment in these
areas and increase access to primary health care services for the tribal population.
Nutrition. T'he Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) carried out a preliminary social assessment for the ICDS and
health components of the APERP. The main findings were: (a) the physical infrastructure of the ICDS system is inadequate,
equipment is limited, medicines in short supply and staffing insufficient; some of these shortfalls could be met through better
convergence of services, but inter-departmental co-ordination was noted to be particularly weak; (b) training is particularly
deficient, especially at the AWW and supervisor level; community awareness/participation is lacking on issues such as
pregnancy related complications, safe delivery, and feeding practices; (c) ICDS service delivery and project management are
particularly weak in tribal areas; the APERP would support an increase in mini AWCs in 29 tribal blocks, and close
convergence with the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) would be sought; GOAP has already recruited MOs in
every tribal block in the State; (d) AP has the highest prevalence of child labor of any state. A survey conducted in 1996 under
the instruction of the Supreme Court of India suggested poor school enrollment, especially for girls. The survey also indicated
that more girls than boys were engaged in hazardous trades in the State. APERP would address this issue through improved
pre-school education. It would also support an intensive girl child education project through funding a bridge course for those
in child labor, especially girl children in hazardous trades.
Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance. The roads improvement program would yield substantial social benefits to the rural
population, particularly in the improvement of access to education, health care, and other social services. A village and rural
household t-ansport survey was conducted in Adilabad and Karimnagar. Preliminary analyses of the survey data suggested that
the levels of road accessibility explain in part the differences in social development indicators between villages with and
without ade,quate road accessibility. No new roads (formation), widening works or realignment are planned, hence there is no
resettlement: work associated with the implementation of the roads component.
Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance. The main beneficiaries of the project would be farmers with holdings averaging
less than 2 hectares (about 1. I ha in the Coastal Region, 1.7 ha in the Telangana Region, and 2.1 ha in the Rayalaseema
Region). The project would lead to a substantially more equitable distribution of water, benefiting particularly tail-end farmers
who are generally in the poorest group. Based on Participatory Rapid Appraisals (PRAs) done during appraisal, the first impact
of the WUA. formation process would also have a positive impact on equity. WUA presidents tend to be from the same social
and economic background as the majority of farmers (predominantly small to medium farmers and without bias according to
caste). The WUA committee elections, based on territorial representatives for different areas in the WUA command and use of
secret ballots, has resulted in balanced area representation and election of leaders. This is an important change from previous
community development efforts, where representatives tended to be large landowners. Another positive feature has been the

election of a few women as W[JA leaders, but this is still not common. To focus on the greater integration of women in WUA
management, a sociological study on Opportunities for Women's Participation would be mounted in early PY2.
Public Enterprise Reform. Implementation of the VRS program would affect over 7,000 employees. A social safety-net
program has been prepared to address the social issues, which would include adequate severance pay, counseling, financial
advice and retraining of the affected workers. DFID has agreed to finance and assist GOAP to implement the social safety-net
program under technical assistance.
6. EnvironmentalAssessment:   Environmental Category  [ A    []B    [x ] C
Primarv Education. The project would not raise any environmental issues. Construction of new schools and additional
classrooms would be on the land donated by the community. At negotiations, GOAP would confirm to the Bank in writing that
no involuntary resettlement would arise from implementing the civil works.
Primary Health. The project would not raise any environmental concerns. Due to the outreach nature of PHC functions, health
care waste generated at the PHC would be small, with very little infectious and negligible quantities of hazardous waste. The
project would, however, improve the present status of health care waste disposal through appropriate disposal methods. A plan
has been developed under the APFRHSP for the disposal of health care waste at different levels of the health system, including
the PHCs. A detailed plan has been worked out for the provision of K-wells at PHCs, designed according to WHO standards.
Nutrition. The project would not raise environmental issues, and no resettlement is anticipated as a result of the project.
Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance. The rehabilitation and maintenance proposed under APERP would not include any
land acquisition or change in alignment of the existing roads. Very marginal land may be acquired, if necessary, for curve and
flattening. Strict adherence to dlesign and construction practices would be followed to mitigate environmental impacts. The
component is therefore categorized as Environment Category C. There are some sections which require bridges with spans
longer than 30m. Of these, for sections requiring approach realignments, limited Environmental Analysis would be carried out
at the time of detailed engineering design. The purpose would be to identify relevant mitigation measures with respect to
construction impacts such as erosion from fresh road cuts and temporary sedimentation of drainage ways, contamination by oil,
grease and fuel in the equipment, creation of stagnant water bodies in borrow pits and quarries. This mitigation plan would be
prepared by consultants for the detailed engineering design. This in turn would be incorporated in the project contract
document. With respect to priority options, cross drain works would be given high priority to avoid stagnation of water and
hindrances to access.
Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance. The proposed works would comprise cleaning up silted canals and drains and
repairing existing hydraulic structures with no expansion of the command areas, construction of additional storage facilities or
alteration of alignments. No land acquisition would be required. Any materials such as silt and weeds would be deposited on
the banks of the canals and drains or used by the farmers for spreading over the fields to improve the physical condition of the
soil. An environmental overview concluded that no adverse environmental impacts would result from the project. Rather, it
would be expected to have positive environmental impacts through more efficient and equitable water use and conservation and
through the improvements of the drainage systems which would decrease water-logging and salinity. The only part of the
program with any potential impact on the environment is the pilot SIFT program which would cover about I percent of the
project area. This program would include more intensive modernization works on the existing systems. Again, the
environmental impact is expected to be positive (reduced water-logging and salinization), but as a precaution a limited
environmental impact assessment (EIA), under terms of reference approved by the Bank, would be carried out for each of these
pilot schemes as part of their detailed preparation. Project supervision would approve each detailed design and EIA to ensure
that environmental mitigation aspects and detailed designs were appropriately carried out. Project costs and financing include
the funds needed for this purpose.
Z Participatory Approach
Fiscal Reform Program. The fiscal program supported by APERP is the result of extensive state-wide discussions. In 1996,
GOAP issued a series of white papers to inform the public about the fiscal difficulties the State was facing. These papers were
widely discussed in the State creating awareness of the issues and reform options. These papers were also discussed in the
State Assembly before the fiscal reform program was announced in a Fiscal Policy Statement issued by the Cabinet.
Primary Education. As in other DPEP projects, activities have been planned and would be implemented by both district and
sub-district authorities, including Village Education Committees and Panchayati Raj institutions. Each village in the project
districts has carried out micro-planning and produced a plan and request for funding. The school committees would be
significantly empowered for school management and financing under the AP Community Participation in School Education

Act 1998. NGOs have also played a strong role under DPEP PHASE I in local capacity building, producing low cost designs
and building techniques for schools and classrooms, developing textbooks, workbooks and other learning materials, organizing
and evaluating in-service teacher training, and assessing student performance. They would continue to be involved in these
activities during project implementation. The DIETs, Institutes for Advanced Studies in Education (IASEs) and the State
Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) have had a key role in project preparation and are the apex
institutions for implementing quality improvement activities such as the design of new textbooks, supplementary texts, and in-
service teacher training modules. Mainstream academic institutions have so far had a marginal role in project preparation, and
that mainly with respect to organizing and analyzing baseline achievement studies. Significant benefits may be obtained by
increasing the participation of academics and academic institutions not only in large scale survey research but also in
qualitative longitudinal case studies, evaluation of specific interventions and project monitoring.
Primarv HealiLh, The private and voluntary sectors, panchayats and communities have an important role to play in enhancing
the quality of and access to services envisaged at the primary level. The rationale for the streamlining of services provided at
the primary level has been developed on the basis of extensive consultation with medical personnel working at all levels of the
DOHFW. Several components planned have community participation as an integral part, including the surveillance system,
the tribal strategy and the NGO/community participation component. In addition, DHCs would be put in place to monitor and
supervise project implementation activities at the district level, and would include community leaders as members.
Nutrition. The component preparation was carried out in a participatory process with a social assessment that included
stakeholder analysis. The component design for decentralized participatory management of ICDS services in the State
involves: (a) creation of mandal ICDS units (2-3 mandals correspond to one development block); and (b) continuous social
assessment to be carried out throughout the project period with the State Institute of Rural Development (SIRD) acting as the
nodal training/resource center. Training for stakeholder participation in the project would be extended to members of village
women's committees, panchayat members and ICDS program functionaries at all levels. The village women's committees
would monitor key project outcomes and participate actively in civil works construction.
Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance A two-day objectives-oriented and participatory workshop was held in June 1997
jointly with more than 30 PRED and local government officials. Through the participatory process during the workshop, rural
road problems were identified and analyzed, project objectives discussed and prioritized, and an overall description of the
project established. The participants evaluated the process and outcome of the workshop very favorably. In November 1997,
district level workshops were held in three districts, respectively, jointly with district government officials, district politicians,
and PRED staff, to discuss the proposed district level programs. Further workshops were held with selected PRED staff from
headquarters and the districts, to define the detailed scope of the project.
Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance. Over the past 12 months; there has been a major outreach program with farmers
through rural rallies and workshops at the district and state levels. The views of farmers, the academic community and NGOs
have been integrated in the Irrigation Policy Statement, which also went through detailed review at Government levels and by
the Cabinet. As part of the preparation of the AP Irrigation III project, two pilot participatory irrigation management (PIM)
operations were launched covering an area of 16,000 ha, the objective being to develop a suitable model for PIM through the
creation of WUAs. In all, 32 WUAs were formed covering an area of about 16000 ha. At the end of the pilot operation,
farmers were able to resolve conflicts between head and tail-end farmers, distribute water more equitably among themselves
and, consequently, irrigate about 25 percent more land. On the basis of this experience GOAP enacted the AP Farmers
Management of Irrigation Systems Act (Act 11 of 1997), 1997, which elaborates on the structure, composition, formation,
function, and duties of farmers organizations at different levels, and their relationships with I&CADD. Under the APERP the
WUAs would: plan the distribution of water; maintain an inventory of the irrigation and drainage systems; maintain the
irrigation and drainage systems; and maintain accounts. The objective would be to integrate farmers in all aspects of decision
making. The other two key stakeholders are the I&CADD and the NGOs. Both have been fully involved in project preparation
and would have a key role in implementation. Under the AP Farmers Management of Irrigation Systems Act (Act 11 of 1997),
the primary finction of I&CADD would be to assist the WUAs in the discharge of their responsibilities and to provide
technical support. The primary functions of the NGOs would be to assist the WUAs in their day to day operations, in close
liaison with the I&CADD. In sum, the APERP would support a partnership between the farmer organizations, staff of
I&CADD and the Agriculture Department, and NGOs.

F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainabii(v.
Fiscal Sustainabilitv: Fiscal sustalinability lies at the heart of the project concept. Putting state finances on a sustainable path is
a critical objective of APERP, which GOAP aims to achieve by: (a) stabilizing the debt/GSDP ratio at about 24 percent to
contain the interest burden at 18 percent of total revenue (both below the average of all Indian states). This requires a reduction
of the fiscal deficit from the present 3.0 percent of GSDP to 2.5 percent by the end of the program period; (b) improving
development impact of public exlpenditure by changing its composition to shift resources from salaries and untargeted subsidies
into social sectors and infrastructare; and (c) simplifying the tax system and improving cost recovery to strengthen revenue
mobilization (See Section B.2 and Annex 11 and Annex 12 for specific annual targets and policy benchmarks).
Fiscal sustainability of the project components is equally important. The budgetary impact of the project (i.e., local funds
needed for implementation of all components) would amount to 0.2 percent of GSDP during the project period and 0.3 percent
after the project is completed. This increased budgetary burden would be manageable in the context of the fiscal reform
program. It would be financed entirely from the budgetary savings expected from rationalization of staff and the rice scheme,
which would jointly constitute 0.7 percent of GSDP at the end of the project period.
Institutional Sustainability. Each project component would include substantial training and capacity building activities, which
have been outlined in earlier sections of this document and are detailed in the component PIPs. For the most part, the project
would rely on existing institutions with a proven track record in previous Bank operations in AP. The most significant
departure from an institutional point of view would be in the irrigation component, which would be applying an entirely new
principle of WUAs. As referred in Section E7 above, this approach is already tested on a pilot basis in AP with impressive
results, and it also has extremely strong political support in the State. The other area where institutional risks may exist is
public enterprise reform, which is both politically and technically demanding. To meet the challenge, three intensive TA
programs would be funded by DFID: institutional strengthening for privatization, safety-net program for retrenched employees,
and introduction of VAT (see Annex 2). Several workshops and seminars have already been held with the technical staff of the
concerned departments to disseminate information on best practice and other countries' experiences in implementing similar
programs. More are planned.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
The progressive removal of subsidies, the emergence of a tighter control over the fiscal situation and the devolution of
operational and fiscal responsibility to water users would obviously remain potentially controversial until the associated benefits
of the program are firmly established and recognized by the beneficiaries. Nevertheless, the extent of consultation that has taken
place between GOAP and civil society and between the Bank and GOAP provides an assurance that the reforms are politically
feasible and that the investments are manageable. With regard to the internal conditions of the project, the long dialogue between
the Bank and GOAP on the nature and content of the APERP, especially the need to link investment with fiscal reform, gives
confidence that, after allowing for political risks, there are few, if any, outstanding issues which could be of serious consequence
during project implementation.
G: Main Loan Conditions
All conditions of negotiations were met. These included: (a) requirements for establishing management structures for all sectoral
components and project as a who le; (b) receipt by the Bank of satisfactory PIPs for each component; (c) passage of the Power
Sector Reform Bill in the State Assembly; (d) receipt by the Bank of the agreed Letter of Development Policy; (e) approval of an
Irrigation Sector Policy Statement; and (f) approval of technical assistance for preparation for introduction of a VAT in the State.
The basic condition for the project implementation is the continuation of the fiscal reform program which has been in effect since
1995 and which has already seen a significant reduction in fiscal deficit. This condition is elaborated in a series of fiscal
benchmarks set out in Annex II and recorded in the Minutes of Negotiations. These benchmarks are divided into two groups:
the first related to overall fiscal performance (annual fiscal targets and a number fiscal measures to be taken during the project
period); and the second to sector objectives implicit in the investment components of the project. At the Mid-Term Review a
detailed evaluation of progress would be conducted, and continued support from the Bank would be contingent on satisfactory
performance to date and on agreement on a package of continued reform measures.
There are no conditions for Board Presentation or Effectiveness.
Assurances Received at Negotiatrions:
Fiscal Reforms. GOAP shall: (a) reduce the fiscal deficit by 0.5 percentage points in the program period from 3.0 percent of
GSDP in 1997-98 according to the following annual targets: 3.0 percent in 1998-99, 3.4 percent in 1999-00, 2.9 percent in 2000-
01, 2.7 percent in 2001-02, and 2.5 percent in 2002-03. [These targets do not reflect the budgetary impact of the power sector
reform program, in particular the fmancial restructuring plan for APSEB under preparation in the context of the proposed power
sector operation. The fiscal impact of this plan would be considered separately when it is completed and agreed upon with the
Bank. The expected pay increase is incorporated in the projections on the basis of assumptions summarized in para 15 of the aide
memoire of the appraisal mission dated May 6, 1998. If the conditions of the actual pay settlement are fiscally more comfortable
than have been assumed, the fiscal targets would be adjusted accordingly during annual reviews. If the actual disbursement of the
loan was faster than the agreed schedule and the primary education and/or the nutrition components of the project were not
approved as centrally sponsored schemes, the fiscal targets would be adjusted accordingly during the annual reviews]; (b) achieve
positive revenue balance of 0.4 percent of GSDP in 2000-01 and keep it at least at that level thereafter; (c) keep the
guarantees/GSDP ratio no higher than the present average of 9 percent; (d) reduce employment in State Government (excluding
primary education ) by 1.9 percent a year; (e) reduce the salary/GSDP ratio from the estimated 5.3 percent in 1997-98 to no
higher than 5.0 percent in 2002-03 (this ratio may increase slightly in 1999-00 when the salary increase is expected to be awarded
to the State Government employees); (f) increase total combined expenditure in primary education and primary health from the
estimated 0.9 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to 1.8 percent in 2002-03 (approximately 0.18 points per year); (g) increase
expenditure on non-salary O&M from the estimated 1.2 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to at least 2.0 percent in 2000-01 and

Andhra Pradesh Economic Restructuring Project
Project Description
Introduction.
AP Economic Restructuring Project (APERP) would provide resources to meet priority needs in human development
(primary health, nutrition and primary education) and in the maintenance of economic assets affecting the rural poor
(irrigation, rural roads and c,ore access roads). This investment would be linked to a program of fiscal reform aimed at
bringing about a permanent shift in public expenditure towards these priorities, while maintaining tight control over
total public expenditure and debt. This shift is essential if the state is to increase its growth rate and to maintain the
capacity to finance much-needed human development programs in the longer term. The link between the proposed
investments and the fiscal reform program would be established by means of covenanted fiscal benchmarks to be
monitored throughout the project period. These covenants are spelled out in detail in Section G and Annex 11.
The total investment proposed under the APERP would be $830 million. It would cover six components: (a) District
Primary Education (US$168.5 million); (b) Primary Health (US$70.2 million); (c) Integrated Child Development
Services (Nutrition) (US$ 103.3 million); (d) Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance (US$179.5 million); (e) Irrigation
Rehabilitation and Maintenance (US$282.3 million); and (f) Public Enterprise Reform (US$26.2 million). These six
components would be financed by IBRD, IDA, GOI, GOAP and beneficiaries. The Public Enterprise Reform
component would also be supported by a parallel Technical Assistance Grant of US$3.8 million from the Department
For International Development (DFID) of the UK government. DFID would also finance TA for the introduction of
VAT, up to US$4.1 million.
Component 1. District Prim,arv Education (US$168.5 million)
The Primary Education component of the APERP would supplement an increase in state government expenditure on
primary education and increase the geographical scope of previous Bank interventions (DPEP Phase I) and the
District Primary Education Program). The project would assist the Department of Education (DOE) of GOI to
extend The District Primary Education Project (DPEP) into 14 educationally disadvantaged districts in AP. The
project would finance constraction of new schools and additional classrooms, recruitment of additional teachers,
establishment of school improvement funds, provision and development of learning materials and recurrent in-
service training of additional teachers. It would also aim to build state, district, and sub-district managerial and
professional capacity for the sustainable development of primary education and would support district-based
activities aimed at ensuring that more children, especially from socially disadvantaged groups, complete a five-year
primary education cycle in low literacy districts.
There would be three sub-components: (a) expanding access to primary education, particularly for disadvantaged
groups; (b) increasing retention and improving learning achievement in primary schools; and (c) improving state
and district capacity to manage primary education.
Expanding Access to Primary Education - US$54.7 million. The following activities would be carried out:
School construction. The preject would fund construction of 6,500 new schools, and 3,500 additional classrooms.
Incremental salaries for approximately 13,000 teachers (about 4000 teachers and 9000 para-teachers) would be
funded to meet the requirement of additional enrollment and reduce the pupil teacher ratio.
Micro-planning and school mapping: Districts have prepared lists of villages that require new schools and of
existing schools that require additional classrooms. The location of new schools would be based on the micro-
planning and school mapping exercises carried out by School Committees. Schools would be built on existing
community land owned by Panchayats. Construction work would be implemented by the communities under
technical supervision. incorporating lessons leamed during the implementation of the community construction sub-
component in the DPEP PHASE I project.
Improving Learning Achievement in Primary School - US$69.6 million.
Teaching-learning materials and school improvementJfunds: The project would fund materials and books for new



Annex 2
Page 2 of 13
schools. To reinforce student learning, children would also be provided workbooks to supplement the revised
textbooks. As in DPEP I, II and III, all teachers in schools in project districts would receive Rs.500 per year to
purchase materials to make teaching aids for use in the classroom. In addition, each school committee would be
provided with a grant of Rs.2,000 as a school improvement fund. School Committees would make their own
decisions on investing this amount for school improvement.
In-service training: The project would fund a ten day residential training program for all teachers every year. In
addition, community teachers would receive fifteen days of induction training. The training would include an
introduction to child-centered teaching and active learning methods, application in multi-grade settings and
possibilities for teacher preparation of teaching aids. Schools under each Teacher Center (TC) would facilitate and
monitor use of improved methods of teaching learned during the training. Key to the success of the program would
be the development of good training materials and the training of effective master trainers and resource persons. All
Mandal Resource Coordinators (MRCs), providing in-service training and technical support, would receive 42 days
of training annually. Master training teams would test materials and approaches on a trial basis in districts using the
facilities o' the District Institutes for Education and Training (DIETs).
Developing, learning materials: Learnig materials for both teachers and students would be developed under the
project. Integrated training packages based on successive cycles of in-service training for existing teachers
completed under DPEP Phase I would be developed for new teachers. Self-learning materials for students and
workbooks to supplement the revised textbooks would be funded from the project. The State Council for
Educational Research and Training (SCERT), DIETs and academic resource groups are being strengthened to
implement these activities.
Teacher and school improvement grants: Teacher grants to purchase teaching materials and school improvement
grants to VECs would be funded from the project according to the procedures agreed between the Bank and GOI.
The expenditures would be disbursed against statements of expenditure (SOE).
Innovative approaches to improve primary education: GOAP has proposed a number of innovative approaches to
improve primary education. A number of these interventions, including Early Childhood Education (ECE) and
back-to-school bridge courses, would require pilot testing. NGOs are already involved in various innovative
activities such as bringing working children into formal schooling, working with women's groups and carrying out
non-formal and alternative education programs. Provision to fund some of these initiatives would be made within
the project.
Improving State and District Capacity to Manage Primary Education - US$44.2 million.
Building and strengthening state and district program management structures: GOAP would implement the
approved state and district Annual Work Program and Budget (AWPBs) investment proposals through its State
Implementation Society (SIS). The SIS through its State Project Office (SPO) would review and supervise the
implementation of state and district AWPBs. The SIS would also coordinate with other state agencies, NGOs,
consulting companies and individuals to carry out project related tasks. The day-to-day implementation of the
project would be managed by the District Project Office (DPO). The DPO would be staffed by a small team of
specialist staff appointed and financed by the SPO. In addition to managing the flow of project funds to project
activities and supervising their implementation at the mandal, school and village levels, key responsibilities of DPO
staff would be awareness building activities, school mapping, management of school statistics and project
management information systems (EMIS and PMIS) and preparation of AWPBs.
Establishing and strengthening state and district resource institutions and/or groups: The project would finance the
strengthening of SCERT's capacity to provide technical support for curriculum revision, improvement of textbook
and instructional material development, development of improved classroom teaching models and in-service teacher
training. This would be carried out with support from national technical assistance programs developed for DPEP I,
II, and III, and from the experience acquired from the DPEP PHASE I project. The DIETs and the SCERT have
been engaged in primary school improvement under DPEP PHASE I for about ten years and have recruited many
qualified and experienced staff. Further, in an attempt to improve project effectiveness and sustainability, GOAP is
redefining the roles and responsibilities of school inspectors, Mandal Resource Center (MRC) coordinators, and TC
staff with greater orientation towards managerial and academic supervision of schools.



Annex 2
Page 3 of 13
Strengthening state and district capacity for carrying out monitoring, research and evaluation activities: With
training and technical support from the national program on program evaluation, research and studies financed
under DPEP I, II and III, SCERTs would be strengthened and expanded to conduct or contract program evaluation
and research studies pertaining to the attainment of the project objectives, as well as the effectiveness of the
innovations implemented for such purposes. To carry out these studies, the State Project Office (SPO) may consider
contracting out the services of NGOs, universities and other apex institutions. In addition, the project would
develop the capacity of the State, district and sub-district level staff to manage the improved management
information systems (EMIS and PMIS), carry out school mapping exercises, consult with parents and community
leaders, prepare annual work programs and monitor project implementation.
Component 2. Primarv Health (USa70.2 million)
The Primary Health component would have three sub-components: (a) upgrading primary health care services; (b)
capacity building; and (c) enhancing community participation.
Upgrading Primary Health Care Services - US$49.4 million
Primary Health Centers (PHC). The PHC is the central health institution at the primary level, providing basic
services. The project would strengthen the functions of PHCs. Specifically, it would: (a) renovate and extend 500
upgraded PHCs and renovate and/or construct 450 PHCs; and (b) upgrade the effectiveness of clinical, outreach and
support services and quality of services at PHCs.
To optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of the primary care, it is proposed that 500 PHCs out of the State's
network of 1,335 PHCs would be upgraded to perforn enhanced services based on norms developed by the
Department of Health and Family Welfare (DOHFW). As a first step in determining which 500 PHCs are to be
upgraded to provide this level of service, districts were categorized using the following criteria: (a) demographic
indicators, including crude birth rate, infant mortality rate and total fertility rate; (b) input indicators, including
availability of government beds per 1,000 population, percentage of rural population covered by government health
services, and percentage of PHCs with permanent buildings; (c) output indicators such as contraceptive prevalence
rate and percentage of institutional deliveries; and (d) socio-economic indicators, including female literacy rate,
percentage of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe population, gender ratio and per capita income.
All 23 districts were scored and ranked according to their performance on these indicators. Category I, comprising
those districts which performed poorly on all groups of indicators, or poorly on three groups of indicators and
average on one group, would be allocated 85 percent of the upgraded PHCs. Category II, comprising districts
performing poorly on two groups of indicators out of four, would be allocated 10 percent of the upgraded PHCs.
Category III, comprising districts which scored average to well in at least three groups of indicators, would be
allocated 5 per cent of the upgraded PHCs. The outcome of this exercise is presented in the PIP. The location of
upgraded PHCs within individual districts has also been determined based on a similar analysis. Of the proposed
500 PHCs to be upgraded, about 425 are in the 15 Category I districts (about 28 PHCs in each district); about 50 are
in the 4 Category II districts; and about 25 are in the 3 Category III districts. It is estimated that about 20 percent of
the 500 selected PHCs would involve new construction; the rest would require only renovation/extension.
In addition, the DHS has 835 PHCs functioning in the State. The quality of services provided at these facilities, and
their utilization rates, are low for a variety of reasons, including doctor absenteeism, lack of adequate infrastructure,
and lack of drugs, materials and supplies. It is proposed that about 450 of these 835 PHCs, which are currently
operating out of rented premises, would be provided with infrastructure and other inputs under the project. These
PHCs would be selected on the basis of indicators similar to those used for choosing the 500 PHCs to be upgraded,
as discussed above. It is proposed, based on the service norms developed, to strengthen the capacity of these PHCs
to provide basic primary care. The role of the paramedics at these PHCs would be crucial and would be
strengthened by providing them with adequate training and support.
Clinical, Outreach and Support Services. Upgraded norms and standards for clinical and support services would be
applied at the 500 selected PlHCs discussed above. Staffing norms conforming to services provided would be
adopted, a system for monitoring improvements in the quality of clinical care would be established and the capacity
of support services would be expanded. Staff skills in clinical and technical areas would be enhanced through
training to improve the quality and range of services.



Annex 2
Page 4 of 13
The focus would be to strengthen service delivery. The DOHFW would take the necessary steps to rationalize the
role of the medical personnel at the PHC, and improve recruitment procedures so as to recruit appropriate personnel
and fill job vacancies promptly. This would include introducing incentives to retain staff in remote and tribal areas.
To this end, the DOHFW in AP would: (a) establish clarity of goals, objectives and procedures with regard to
institutional technical and quality issues; (b) enhance clinical and technical training for: (i) about 800 Medical
Officers at E'HCs, to be trained in a range of clinical services, including essential obstetric and neonatal care and
emergency care; and (ii) about 2,800 Auxiliary Nurse Midwives, Lady Health Visitors and Multi-Purpose Workers
at PHCs, to be trained in reproductive and child health issues.
Capacity Building. - US$15.5 million
Capacity-building activities would include: (a) improving the systems for referral, health management information
(HMIS), disease surveillance, and procurement and distribution of materials; (b) enhancing the management skills
of staff; and (c) improving project management.
Improving 5vstems. Under the project: clinical skills at primary level facilities would be updated and upgraded;
technical support for the primary level of care and community hospitals would be strengthened; and referral
mechanisms between sub-centers, PHCs and secondary hospitals would be strengthened. The project would seek to
ensure that a much higher proportion of patients coming to first referral hospitals had been seen at PHCs and
referred upvvards. This would be accomplished by: (a) defining the services to be provided at the PHC and
dovetailing them with those provided at the first referral hospitals; (b) enhancing the quality of services provided at
the primary level; (c) strengthening the management of the referral system; (d) implementing the referral protocols
that specify the "what", "when" and "how" of referrals; (e) implementing clinical management protocols; (f)
creating public awareness of the types of services available at different institutions; and (g) establishing an incentive
system. The project would establish links within the primary care level and with the first referral level. The first
referral hospitals, supported by Bank-assisted APFRHSP, would provide clinical and technical support to the PHCs.
A comprehensive HMIS would be developed which adopts the method of information warehousing.
Comprehensive databases on personnel, drug and equipment inventories, and health statistics would be developed
for all programs managed by the DHS, and made available to the department to facilitate policy development and
planning. The HMIS would incorporate parameters to serve as indicators of the quality of care and of the
implementation of the various national programs. Phase I would focus on developing systems to monitor the
functioning of the PHCs and sub-centers. Performance indicators (developed under Phase I) would be monitored in
Phase II when the HMIS would be extended to cover all other operations of the DHS, including inventory
management, bio-statistics, equipment procurement and maintenance and general accounts.
An improved surveillance system proposed under the project would cover the identification of cases through
education of health workers and community involvement; indexing or isolation of cases and treatment; and tracing
of contacts for monitoring and evaluation. To accomplish this, the system would be strengthened with equipment
and supplies and the setting up of efficient systems of analysis and feedback.
It is proposed that civil works procurement would be managed by the APHMHIDC in a manner similar to the
arrangement: under the APFRHSP. Drug procurement and distribution would be managed departmentally by
enhancing staff and strengthening key functions, and equipment procurement and maintenance would be managed
departmentally but transferred to a suitable unit created for this purpose. Medical officers would specify the norms
for drugs, equipment and other material procured. Allocation of these items would be based on actual requirement
calculated on the basis of the performance of individual units assessed through the HMIS. This system would
replace the current system of block allocations and indents with one which relies on performance indicators. All
quality standards would be reviewed continuously.
Staff Training. The project would support a Health Manpower Development Cell at the state level; upgrade four
Regional Training Centers; and establish 23 district training teams along with 23 field practice/demonstration PHCs.
A training needs assessment for management training has already been completed. Training would cover: (a) about
800 medical officers at PHCs, who would be trained in a range of management services, including referral services
and medico-legal work; (b) DM&HO and Additional and Deputy, DM&HOs, who would be trained in general
management, financial management, operational management, public health care and inventory management; and
(c) District Program Officers, who would be trained in program management, team building, MIS, inter-sector

coordination and operational management. About 200 officers would be trained in categories (b) and (c). Provision
has also been made for local and international fellowships.
Project Management. The primary health component would be managed by a Project Director (reporting to the
Secretary, Medical, Health and Family Welfare, and located in the Directorate of Health), who would coordinate all
activities of the Directorate of Health (DOH), the Directorate of Family Welfare (DFW) and the AP Vaidhya
Vidhana Parishad (APVVP) relating to the Project. A Project Governing Board (PGB) would be chaired by the
Chief Secretary and would include high-level representation from all relevant parts of the State Government
associated with the project. The PGB would mainly consider issues relating to interdepartmnental coordination
including release of budget and sanction of staff and it would monitor the overall implementation of the project.
Periodic review of impleme:ntation would be done by a Project Implementation Committee (PIC), which would be
responsible for coordinating programs under the administration of different departments. The Secretary, Medical,
Health and Family Welfare would be the Chairman of the PIC.
In each district, a District Health Committee (DHC) would be set up to coordinate national health programs, family
welfare programs and nutrition programs; the functioning of the referral system; maintenance of equipment; training
of staff; quality assurance; surveillance of communicable diseases; and the monitoring and supervision of all project
activities. The DHC would be chaired by the District Collector, and would include district level officers in charge
of national programs and representatives from other relevant departments. The DHC would evaluate the
functioning of the PHCs, the establishment of HCs and other health institutions in the district as well as assess the
performance of the district in relation to the various national programs. The project would also strengthen the PHC
medical officer's authority to implement improvements in service delivery. A contingency grant would be made to
each PHC on an established scale to be used for non-salary recurrent costs, such as repair of electrical and surgical
equipment, stationery, diagnostic material, toilet maintenance and building maintenance.
Under the APFRHSP, a strategic planning cell (SPC) has been set up to address strategic planning issues in the
health sector and provide management with policy options. There is, within the DHS, an Evaluations Cell which
has the responsibility for analyzing data from different health programs being administered by the DHS. Under the
proposed APERP this cell would be merged with the SPC, and would report to the Secretary, Medical, Health and
Family Welfare. The SPC would be provided with additional funding and charged with the responsibility of
defining technical and quality problems faced by the primary health care delivery system. It would undertake
operational and policy research at the primary level, in addition to the work it is already undertaking in the
APFRHSP. The findings of such research would be used to reform systems and practice at the primary level, and
disseminated to the appropriate functional level by the PMC.
Enhancing Community Participation - US$5.3 million
Enhancing the willingness of beneficiaries to seek health care is a key to improving health care outcomes, especially
among the poor. This would require better knowledge and awareness of available services and a greater emphasis
on community mobilization to strengthen the links between different sub-components such as the referral
mechanism, disease surveillance, information, education and communication (IEC) and the tribal strategy.
Specifically, the project would (a) enhance the quality and coordination of the Information, Education and
Communication (IEC) programs; and (b) involve NGOs and community-based organizations in the delivery of
outreach services
IEC Programs. There is no coordination at present between different departments with regard to the development
and dissemination of IEC messages (TB, malaria, AIDS, cataract blindness and leprosy, maternal and child health
and nutrition), even though there is a great deal of overlap with regard to the content of the messages and the target
audience. The project would set up a coordination mechanism for these messages through the DHCs. Among other
functions, the DHCs would serve as the nodal body at the district level to coordinate the activities of the health,
family welfare and women and child development departments. The IEC program would also be used to
disseminate information on thte functioning of the referral mechanism and reduce wastage of time and resources by
directing patients to the appropriate level of care. The IEC component would also form links with the surveillance
system and the health management information system proposed under the project. This would provide the IEC
agency access to vital information regarding the prevalence of communicable diseases and utilization of services.

Involving NGOs and Community-based organizatioiys in the Delivery of Outreach Services. Under the project a
fund would be set up to facilitate the development of innovative schemes for promoting the involvement of key
stakeholders in project implementation. The purpose of this fund would be to pilot new schemes or build upon
previous pilots to devise ways through which to mobilize the community to promote health service access and
effectiveness.
Component 3' Nutrition (Integrated Child Development Services) (USS 103.3 million)
The focus of the ICDS component would be to strengthen service delivery. There would be eight sub-components,
as follows: (a) service quality improvement; (b) women's empowerment; (c) staffing and infrastructure
development; (d) management and institutional development; (e) training; (f) information, education and
communications; and (g) monitoring and evaluation.
Service Quality Improvement - US$14.6 million.
The project would support improved operations at 32,727 nutrition centers with additional provision of creches,
during the first three years of the project. Specifically, support would be provided for staff salaries for the new
blocks and for the village community nutrition fund created to sustain the creches, on a declining basis over the
project period. It would also support establishment of 2,700 additional mini-nutrition centers in hilly tribal blocks
for hamlet coverage and provision of weighing scales, utensils, community growth charts, pre-school materials and
drugs at nutrition centers.
Women's Empowerment - US$3.9 million.
The would provide training and capacity building for women's groups and thrift societies. Nutrition and health
education training (NHED) and awareness campaigns for women and adolescent girls would be supported under
this component. It would also support a bridge course, for adolescent girls between I I and 16 years-old, and
procurement of iron-foliate and deworming drugs for adolescent girls.
Staffing ancl Infrastructure Development - US$65.7 million
The project would support expansion of ICDS in 143 blocks, thereby universalizing the program in the State. This
component would help AP decentralize ICDS according to its own administration structure, replacing the ICDS
block structure. This requires financial support of additional staff created at the mandal level. The project would
also support civil works for nutrition centers, CDPO office-cum-godowns, and hand pump installation.
Procurement of equipment for the new centers such as furniture, utensils, and pre-school materials would also be
provided. Greater community involvement is expected to be achieved through masonry training provided for
women and subsequently participation of these women in the construction program in the project.
Management and Institutional Development - US$2.3 million.
The project would assist in capacity-building by creation of a state-level management unit integrated with the
existing ICDS program. It would also support implementation of institutional development programs such as
training management staff in "quality circles".
Training - lUS$10.8 million.
Improved worker training is crucial to the success of the ICDS program. The project would support this by making
improved training the centerpiece of the project design, through enhanced financing norms for training, increasing
training capacity, supporting state-wide training and IEC functions and emphasis on technical capacity and delivery
of quality services. The project would support pre-service, in-service and state-specific orientation training for
ICDS functiionaries with enhanced financial norms across the State. The project would also support the
establishment of a state training-cum-IEC resource center at state headquarters.
Information, Education and Communications - US$4.6 million.
The project would support ongoing fixed-day advocacy strategies such as the "mother and child" health days,
communications workshops for all levels of functionaries and preparation of materials and media services.



Annex 2
Page 7 of 13
Monitoring and Evaluation - US$1.4 million.
The project would support improvements to the state ICDS MIS operations and operational research on the
feasibility of community-supported supplementary nutrition programs, continued social assessments, Participatory
Rapid Appraisal (PRA) training for ICDS functionaries and the Mid-Term and final evaluation surveys.
Component 4. Rural Road Upgrading and Maintenance (US$199.8 million)
State Roads: Heavy Periodic Maintenance - US$75.6 million
Primary Core Network. During preparation of the ongoing Bank-financed AP State Highway Project, a primary
core network of 10,000 km of state highways and selected heavily-trafficked major district roads was identified for
priority attention under the maintenance management component. In order to analyze periodic maintenance
requirements, this network was stratified by functional class, traffic flow and road condition, and indicative
treatments were proposed for each case. Part of this network (1,200 km in three districts) would be financed under
the APERP with a view to reducing the backlog of heavy maintenance and to removing the deficiencies in the core
network. Road stretches would be selected according to condition and traffic volume, with due emphasis on
economic returns. The choice of the primary network to be financed under the project was aimed at ensuring full
connectivity for a secondary core of rural roads serving some 1.5 million rural population in the same three districts.
Secondary Core Network. The secondary core network would provide basic all-weather access to every village in
the three selected districts. The network is classified into main roads and link roads and is directly interlinked with
roads in the primary core network (above). After extensive field reconnaissance, traffic surveys, village
connectivity data and adoption of the functional design standards (e.g. using blacktopping only for roads connecting
more than 3,000 populatiorn etc. in tune with the draft policy), deficiencies in the network roads were identified and
cost estimates for their removal prepared. Main roads and links were then separately ranked according to the cost
per km per thousand population connected. While selecting roads within the limited funds (US$20 million per
district) available under the project, first priority was given to main roads. Also weight was given to some specific
problems such as missing links and unbridged crossings, and a judicious mix of cost effectiveness and practical
solutions was arrived at. To minimize environmental issues in the final selection, roads passing through the forest
area were not considered. To maximize the efficiency of project management and to enhance the impact of the
project generally, roads smaller than three km. in length were not considered.
Upgrading - US$76.9 million
This would include: (a) upgrading about 2,800 km of seasonal roads to all-weather standard, including the
construction of an estimatecd 650 drainage works; (b) the construction of 35 bridges with spans larger than 30
meters; and (c) the employnnent of design and supervision consultants. Links proposed for upgrading to bituminous
standard would be subject to cost/benefit analysis in each individual case. All other works would be related to the
provision of minimum access and would be ranked and selected according to cost-effectiveness criteria.
Design and supervision of the upgrading program would be carried by consultants to be employed by the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU). Average contract size for the upgrading works would be between Rs.2.2 and 3.6 crores
(US$600,000 to US$ 1.0 million). Preparations for a Phase I Program amounting to about Rs. 100 crores (US$28.0
million) should commence immediately after the list of selected works is cleared by the World Bank.
Maintenance: - US$43.3 million
Maintenance of the secondary core network would be an integral part of the project, to be executed as proposed in
the Rural Roads Policy Framework. Estimates for the yearly maintenance of the entire core road network (12,500
km in the three districts) cover ordinary (routine) and periodic maintenance for a period of four years. Provisions
for emergency maintenance and maintenance of structures have been made. The estimates are based on detailed
analysis of the different work items required for the routine and periodic maintenance of the entire core network
based on unit rates of basic work categories. Details are given in the PIP.



Annex 2
Page 8 of 13
Capacity Biiiilding - US$4.0 million
Institutional capacity building would be aimed at enhancing the capacity of Panchayat Raj Engineering Department
(PRED) (Roads) and ensuring smooth project implementation. It would consist of: (a) Technical Assistance to the
PIU at PRED) headquarters; (b) training for the involved staff of PRED (an estimated number of 125); (c) provision
of means of transport for supervision purposes (19 vehicles and 50 motorcycles), refurbishing of old vehicles and
hiring of additional vehicles; (d) provision of office equipment for the PIU and involved district offices; and (e)
external technical audit.
Component .5. Irrigation Rehabilitation and Maintenance (US$282.3 million)
The irrigation component would have four sub-components: (a) Scheme Performance Improvement, consisting of
minimum rehabilitation of major and medium irrigation schemes (2.45 m. ha) and recurrent maintenance of major,
medium, and minor irrigation schemes (3.70 m. ha); (b) Scheme Improvement and Farmer Turnover (SIFT)
covering pilot schemes in each of the three AP regions (46,756 ha); (c) Irrigated Agriculture Intensification Program
(IAIP) in all project irrigation schemes; and (d) Institutional Support to the Irrigation and Command Area
Development Department (I&CADD) and the Water Users Associations (WUAs) including the setting up of a
Project Management Unit (PMU) and a Human Resources Development (HRD) Unit for training and WUA support.
Scheme Performance Improvement - US$240.8 million
Minimum Rehabilitation Works (US$101.7 million). Minimum Rehabilitation is different in scope from
modernization or full rehabilitation. To keep costs to a minimnum, only essential repairs and improvements would
be undertaken. The program would cover most of the public sector major and medium irrigation schemes directly
managed by I&CADD, but would not include minor irrigation schemes due to their large number and wide
geographical distribution. The works would be confined strictly to areas which can reasonably be irrigated taking
into account the amount of water available and the current cropping pattern. No new areas would be irrigated under
this program., except for what can be achieved through improved canal conditions and water management by the
I&CADD and WUAs.
The areas to be covered by Minimum Rehabilitation are described in detail in the PIP (Annex 16). In total, they
would amount to 2,172,018 ha in major irrigation schemes and 276,336 ha in medium irrigation schemes. Priority
would be given to deferred maintenance and special repairs works in headworks, canals, drains, and hydraulic
structures. The rehabilitation of some service roads may be considered when these are essential for O&M of the
systems. In principle, no modernization or improvement works would be carried out except in exceptional cases
where they are considered absolutely essential for scheme operation. However, the remodeling of control structures
at the head of distributories, minors, and outlets may be undertaken to provide the required discharge and enable the
Scheme, Distributory, and WUA committees to control irrigation water efficiently. The minimum rehabilitation
works would include desilting of canals and drains, repair of canal linings, cross regulators and their gates, drop
structures, ciross drainage structures, outlet structures, etc. The detailed list of works eligible for financing are
indicated in the PIP (Annex 4).
Recurrent Maintenance Works (US$139.1 million). The project would deal with regular maintenance to be carried
out by the I&CADD and the Project, Distributory, and WUA Committees. These works would be carried out
systematically, as stipulated in the O&M manuals. Recurrent maintenance would include annual desilting of canals
and drains, annual maintenance of canal linings, cross regulators and their gates, drop structures, cross drainage
structures, outlet structures, etc. The detailed list of recurrent maintenance works to be carried out under the project
is given in the PIP (Annex 4). Coverage would include all public sector major, medium, and minor irrigation
schemes directly managed by the Irrigation Department, except for those currently being constructed or financed by
the Bank or other financing agencies. The exact areas to be covered by this sub-component are detailed in the PIP
(Annex 16). In total they would amount to: Major Irrigation Schemes 2,172,018 ha; Medium Irrigation Schemes
276,336 ha; Minor Irrigation Schemes 1,252,536 ha.
Costs of O&M have been estimated: (a) for the project, distributory, and minor level of irrigation systems; (b) for
each type of scheme whether major, medium, or minor; and (c) for each region. These O&M costs would serve as a
basis for estimating the amounts to be spent by the I&CADD and the WUAs to enable them to carry out recurrent
maintenance works regularly. These estimates would also enable the Water Charges Review Committee (WCRC) to



Annex 2
Page 9 of 13
fix the level of irrigation and other water charges to bridge the gap between the amounts collected by the Revenue
Department and the actual amounts spent by the I&CAD. The project would finance only the works portion of this
sub-component over a period of two years and on a declining basis.
Scheme Improvement and Farmer Turnover (SIFT) - US$25.6 million
The project would modernize a limited number of pilot medium and (portions of) major irrigation schemes to serve
as a demonstration on how overall scheme performance could be substantially improved to facilitate the
management and turnover of O&M responsibilities to project and distributory level committees and WUAs. It
would include: (a) detailed studies for scheme improvement and canal automation; and (b) the modernization of the
irrigation, drainage, and road systems including lining of canals, installation of measuring devices, motorized or
automatic gates, long crested weirs regulators and improvements to outlets, and any other equipment or structures
required for modernizing the systems. Cost estimates have been prepared based on preliminary designs. Detailed
investigation, design and cost estimates would be carried out by consultants during the first project year. Coverage
would include one medium and part of a major irrigation scheme in each of the three regions of AP. The selection
of the schemes has been made where there are no pending issues regarding the dam and headworks and the schemes
are easily accessible for demonstration purposes. The PIP (Annex 16) details the areas to be covered. In total, the
area to be covered would be: 22,581 ha in Coastal AP; 10,057 ha. in Rayalaseema Region; and 14,118 ha in
Telangana Region. The total coverage would be 46,756 ha.
In addition, it is proposed to introduce canal automation in one scheme, expected (subject to feasibility analysis) to
be the Nagarjuna Sagar Right Canal, to provide a basis for extending this technology to other schemes later.
Detailed studies and cost estimates would be prepared with the assistance of international consultants during the first
Project Year.
Irrigated Agriculture Intensification Program - US$2.5 million
The low performance of surface irrigation schemes in AP is partly due to a lack of proper extension work by the
Agriculture Department (AD) on irrigated agriculture and on-farm water management. The Irrigated Agriculture
Intensification Program (IJAIP) under the project would cover the whole State and would include: (a) sourcing and
consolidation of irrigated agricultural technology and dissemination, to increase knowledge of irrigated agriculture
throughout the AD, by creating an agricultural intensification cell in the AD; (b) training of AD Staff on land
preparation for irrigated crops and irrigation methods, with selected field staff becoming trainers of the Mandal
level DA Motivators, and the WUA contact farmers at the field level; (c) improvement in Irrigated Agricultural
Services, using the Training and Visit principles to extend improved irrigated agricultural practices to farmers in
irrigated areas; (d) training of WUA Motivators in the existing 22 District Training Centers; (e) on-farm
demonstrations in irrigated agriculture to be carried out in the fields of the WUA members under the leadership and
supervision of the Motivators; and (f) partnership building among farmers, AD and I&CADD staff through
formation of joint committees for irrigated agriculture at the Mandal, village and distributary levels with the
concerned AD Motivators, I&CADD staff, Distributary & WUA Presidents and contact farmers.
A detailed description of this sub-component is provided in the PIP (Annex 6).
Institutional Support and Development - US$13.4 million
The irrigation sector reform program requires a partial reorganization of the I&CADD and the creation of two new
units: (a) Project Monitoring Unit (PMU); and (b) Human Resources Development Unit (HRDU).
Project Monitoring Unit. The existing Planning & Monitoring Cell under the Engineer-in-Chief (Administration) of
the I&CADD, would be restructured to include a PMU to monitor all I&CADD activities relating to the proposed
Irrigation component. Project monitoring would be implemented through the establishment of a computerized
Management Information System (MIS) and an extensive communication system to facilitate the flow of
information. In addition, several studies, baseline surveys, study tours, fellowships, transport, and equipment would
be carried out (see PIP, Amiex 7). The PMU would include the following cells to be set up or strengthened under
the project: (a) Planning an(d Budgeting, (b) Procurement; (c) Financial Management; (d) MIS; and (e) Monitoring.
Each cell would effectively coordinate and monitor the implementation of the various project components through a
computerized MIS. In partiicular, the PMU would be responsible for carrying out specific studies and surveys,



Annex 2
Page 10 of 13
organizing study tours and fellowships, and procuring transport and equipment. Finally, the PMU would serve as
Secretary of the WCRC.
A Central MIS cell would be established within the PMU in communication with the District offices through
NICNET or similar private satellite communication systems and within the Districts by P&T telephone lines. Thus,
each I&CADD office from the Engineer-in-Chief down to Executive Engineer level would be able to communicate
and transfer data and reports irrespective of the location of their office. In addition, within each major irrigation
scheme, a dedicated monitoring system (DMS) with VHF communications would be established. The main
objective of these DMS would be to facilitate the management of each major irrigation scheme by the Project,
Distributory., and WUA committees from the administrative, financial, and technical points of views. The DMS
would be linked to the main MIS system via satellite through NICNET or similar private satellite communication
systems.
Details of equipment required under the project for MIS, weather monitoring, flow measurement, offices and
transport, and of specific activities and studies handled by PMU, are given in the PIP (Annex 7).
Human Resources Development Unit (HRDU). This new Unit would be established under the Director General,
Water and Land Management Training Institute (WALAMTARI) to train all the I&CADD staff, WUA office
bearers, and NGOs as well as to provide support to the WUAs through newly created District Training Units
(DTUs) and support organizations. The project would also finance office space, several studies, surveys, study
tours, fellowships, transport, and equipment (PIP, Annex 8). The main focus of irrigation sector reform is on
participatory irrigation management, for which WUAs have been formed in the entire State. To build up the
WUAs' capacity to assume their new responsibilities, a Task Group has been set up under the overall supervision of
the Director General WALAMTARI to prepare a very large training program. The Task Group is headed by a
Director at headquarters and DTUs would be set up in each district headed by an Executive Engineer (EE) (PIP,
Annex 5). In all, about 100,000 WUA representatives and various departmental officers would be given continuous
training. Training of senior government officers and trainers would take place at WALAMTARI, while that of field
staff and WUA functionaries would be carried out in DTUs, or sub-centers of the district, or in strategic places in
the major project command areas.
Participatory Irrigation Management, as considered under the Farmers Management of Irrigation Schemes Act,
1997, implies the involvement of various departments such as Agriculture, Revenue, Cooperation, and Marketing
apart from the I&CADD and the WUAs, NGOs, social workers/organizations, and other public representatives.
Intensive training in the reform program would thus have to be imparted to each one of these agencies. Full details
of the extent and subject matter of the training programs is included in the PIP (Annex 5).
Component 5. Public Enterprise Reform (US$26.2 million)
The APERP would provide resources to assist GOAP in meeting the cost of severance pay as part of an on-going
reform of public enterprises. Under this program GOAP has already privatized two companies and closed four. A
number of sugar and spinning mills are also in the initial stages of privatization. A "Strategic Options Study" has
been completed for Singareni by consultants funded by the United Kingdom Departmnent for International
Development (DFID), the results of which will shortly be presented to the Government. The process of public
enterprise reform would require funding for voluntary retirement, combined with technical assistance for
institutional support.
Essentially, the reform program would have three parts, which would be implemented over a period of five years:
(a) implementation of the Phase I Action Plan; (b) strengthening of institutional capacity; and (c) preparation of a
Phase II Action Plan. The APERP would provide support for the first of these. Parallel DFID grant funding would
support all three.
Implementation of the Phase I Action Plan - US$26.2 million
Phase I would focus on twelve small and medium enterprises that operate in competitive markets and whose
restructuring, and privatization would not involve complex institutional and social issues. This approach would be
more likely t:o demonstrate the feasibility of the reform process and help build public acceptance. The Government
has chosen twelve units (Table 1 below) which offer potential for easy disposition and are relatively unobtrusive in
terms of social impact. These enterprises have nearly 14,000 employees, of which GOAP estimates about 7,250



Annex 2
Page 11 of 13
would be surplus as a result of restructuring, privatization, and closure. About 1,450 employees are in the five firms
that are to be wound up (AE'SSIDC, APHDC, APTEX) or downsized through the closure of unviable assets (Agro-
Industries, Meat and Poultry). The remaining 5,550 are in the four cooperative spinning mills and the PE that are to
be restructured and privatized, including NSL, APSIDC, and Allwyn Watch (which together account for about 60
percent of the surplus). The surplus estimates were derived on the basis of earlier studies at the enterprise-level (as
in NSL), comparisons with industry norms (as in the spinning mills), and information gathered by the Government
from the companies. Based on these figures, it is estimated that the total ex-gratia cost of Voluntary Retirement
(VRS) for these twelve enterprises would amount US$26.2 million.
These figures provide an estimate of the scope and cost of the VRS program to be supported under APERP. The
actual surplus would be determined on a case-by-case basis at the time of restructuring and privatization, taking into
account detailed manpower assessments, the privatization approach that is adopted, and negotiations with the
buyers. For example, some enterprises could be sold on an "as is" basis with the existing employment intact (as
occurred in the case of the l[indupur unit of NSL). In others, the buyer might be willing to take on a larger
proportion of the existing lalbor force than is anticipated in view of expected increases in capacity utilization and/or
expansion. In others, the buyers might be willing to take only the assets free of any employees.

Neither GOAP nor the enterprises have the resources to finance the up-front costs of the VRS program. APERP
would thus help finance 70 percent of the total VRS cost. Utilization of Bank funds for VRS would be limited to
the twelve companies listed under Phase I and would be subject to the following conditions:
*  Bank funds would be used only for the ex-gratia component of the overall VRS package as specified
in Section 6 (b) of the existing VRS scheme (Memo No. 1038, January 1996). Terminal benefits and
other legal dues as provided for in Section 6 (a) of the Memo would not be covered by Bank financing.
Wage arrears would also not be financed.
*  Bank funds would be used only for employees who meet the eligibility criteria for VRS as specified in
Sections 3 and 4 of the existing VRS scheme and for employees who are compensated under the
Industrial Disputes Act.
*  All VRS submissions involving Bank financing would be pre-audited as per present practice by the
Treasury and Accounts Department.
*  The Government would make explicit provision for the counterpart funds for implementing the costs
of the severance program.
*  The Government would ensure that employees who have taken VRS are not re-employed in other
parts of the PE sector, State Govermment, or any other public organization.
The VRS program would be financed through the State Renewal Fund (SRF) which was created in January 1996
(G.O. No. 25) with an initial contribution of Rs.5 crores (approximately US$1.25 million). As per the guidelines for
the administration of the SRF (G.O. No. 429), the amounts from the SRF would be released to the enterprises as an
interest-free loan for complete closures and at 15 percent interest rate for ongoing concerns. The loans would be
repaid from the proceeds realized through the sale of assets. More generally, as per G.O. No. 25, proceeds from the
disinvestment of any equity or sale of any assets of PEs and cooperatives would be deposited in the SRF to meet the
VRS costs of PE reform and privatization. Proceeds from the Bank loan for the VRS program and the government
counterpart funds would also be deposited into the SRF. The SRF is maintained by the Finance Department.
Once a VRS program is submitted by the concerned Administrative Department in consultation with General
Administration (PE) Department and Finance and approved by the Government, the concerned enterprise is
responsible for implementing the VRS program. Since there would be twelve enterprises in the VRS program under
APERP, responsibility for overall coordination and monitoring of the program would rest with the Implementation
Secretariat (see Institutional Strengthening below). More specifically, the Secretariat would develop a time-bound
Action Plan for the VRS program and monitor progress in each enterprise and in the program as a whole, including:
(a) the nurnber of employees who have taken VRS, the VRS payments made (ex-gratia and legal dues), and the
source of funds that have been used; (b) the number of employees who are still to take VRS, the payments to be
made, and the financing sources to be used; and (c) changes in aggregate employment in the enterprise during the
reporting period.
TA Compoj2ent: Funded by UK Department For International Development (USS 7.9 million)
Critical to the success of the PE Reform Program would be the institutional strengthening and technical assistance to
be financecd by DFID in parallel with APERP. There are three parts to this assistance:
Institutional Strengthening - US$3.2 million.
The institutional framework for implementing PE reform would consist of: (a) Cabinet Sub-Committee (CSC) on
Public Enterprises and Cooperatives, and (b) Implementation Secretariat (IS) to the Cabinet Sub-Committee. The
CSC would have responsibility for setting broad policies and guidelines and for overseeing implementation.
However, it would delegate its implementation responsibility to a technical unit to be established within the
Department of Public Enterprises through a Government Order (GO) as the Implementation Secretariat (IS). The IS
would plan and recommend the reform program to the CSC and implement it on its behalf once approved.



Annex 2
Page 13 of 13
The core team of the IS would include: (a) a Chairman;(b) two Transaction Managers; (c) a Legal Consultant; (d) a
Financial Consultant; (e) a Media Expert; (f) a Labor Expert; and (g) a Research Associate and Computer Specialist.
The TORs along with responsibilities and authorities of the Chairman and each of the core technical staff is
provided in the Aide Memoire of the Appraisal Team for the Fiscal Reform Component of APERP (Attachment '11'
to Annex B). The IS team would also include a minimum number of civil service personnel (including the Assistant
Advisors currently working with PEMB) to work closely with the core technical staff on transactions and to perform
liaison and other functions required under the Government's business rules. External advisors and investment
banks would be hired on a short-term basis to assist in specific transactions as needed. At any time, the size of the
core staff would be determined by the size and scope of the program being implemented. A detailed description of
the proposed institutional framework is given in Annex B to the Aide-Memoire referred to above. Draft TORs have
already been prepared for the TA program, as shown in Annex C of the Aide-Memoire. Under the present plan, the
IS is expected to be fully operational with all core staff in place by December 31, 1998. All other procurement
under the DFID TA program would also have been completed by this date. The recruitment of financial advisors, if
any, would have been completed for the units to be privatized according to the privatization schedule in Table 3 of
the Aide-Memoire.
Preparation of the Phase IlAction Plan. Phase II would include preparation of an action plan for the remaining
public enterprises including the larger ones and cooperatives. As a first step, a team of industry, regulatory and
transaction experts would be recruited for each of the larger enterprises. These experts would conduct a 'due
diligence' process covering financial, legal, technical and regulatory issues and would present to the Government a
'Strategic Options Paper' on the possibilities available for restructuring, privatization, and disinvestment of each of
these enterprises. The Government would scrutinize these options, and consider the one which provides maximum
benefits with least resistance.
Social Safety Net Program - US$ 0.6 million.
To minimize the social impact of reducing surplus manpower, APERP support the development of a social safety
net program for the Phase I Action Plan. The program, which would be financed by DFID, would: (a) provide
technical assistance to prepare and implement the program; and (b) cover the costs of implementing the program.
The main components to be included would be counseling services (general counseling and financial counseling),
retraining support, and limited follow-up services to assist workers in integrating into the labor market or becoming
self-employed. The safety net program as a whole, and the retraining/follow-up services in particular, would be
designed to ensure that it is demand-driven with participation on a purely voluntary basis; carefully targeted to
workers for whom such services are likely to be most cost-effective, in particular younger workers; and kept as
institutionally simple as possible by contracting out day-to-day implementation to a specialized institute that would
work in close coordination wiith and under the supervision of the Government. Draft TOR for the program are
presented in Annex D of the Aide Memoire of the Appraisal Mission.
Introduction of Value Added Tax - US$ 4.1 million
The sales tax provides about two-thirds of the state's own tax revenue. In spite of the efforts made during the past
few years to improve the sales tax system, it remains a highly complex and distortionary tax. The government
intends to replace it with a full-fledged VAT after adequate preparation. The issues related to the design of VAT
and the strategy of introduction of VAT in AP in a federal structure were discussed with the government and
agreements were reached on the main principles. The preparation period which will involve preparation of the VAT
legislation, training of the staff and taxpayers, computerization, and development of the software and the
management information system, will be two years to be supported by technical assistance under parallel grant
financing from DFID. Draft TOR for technical assistance which was prepared in collaboration with DFID, are
presented in Annex F of the Aide Memoire of the Appraisal Mission.

Summary of Benefits and Costs:
1.     The benefits of the severance program include the additional contribution to the economy that the surplus
workers would be able to deliver by working where there is a demand for their services and by the marginal
productivity value of the foregone labor costs. The marginal productivity value of laid-off workers elsewhere in the
economy is the product of the probability of fmding-alternative work and the net income produced by such activity,
taking into account: employee attributes (age, skill level); labor market conditions (average unemployment
duration); and location of the enterprise. In some cases the laid-off employee may get ajob at the expense of
someone else's job and his net contribution might be zero. However, it is assumed that such cases are relatively
rare. The economic benefits also include the marginal productivity of the foregone labor cost of the enterprises,
which represents the opportunity cost of the outlays that would be saved by the program and that could be used by
the enterprises for more productive purposes. It is estimated as equivalent to the annual wage savings to the
enterprise from staff reduction.
2.     The economic costs of the severance program are given by: (a) the severance payments (which include
only the ex-gratia or incentive component of the VRS package); and (b) counseling and training costs. Severance
payments would not be labeled. economic costs in an environment without budget constraints or price distortions as
under these conditions the outlays would be considered as income-efficient transfers to redundant employees.
However, AP does have a budgiet constraint and a tax system which results in price distortions. Severance payments
were thus included to recognize the importance of the costs of public funds as every dollar of public resources used
to finance severance has an equivalent economic cost which needs to be taken into account. Training also entails
economic costs as the training agency has an alternative use for its resources. Training would be provided by a
government or semi-government agency. An additional economic cost would be the marginal productivity value of
the retrenched employees, or the value of services not rendered by the enterprises because of the retrenchments.
However, the marginal productivity of surplus workers is assumed to be zero since the remaining personnel is
sufficient to carry out current production levels.
Main Assumptions
3.     In estimating the costs of the program, it is assumed that surplus workers have zero marginal productivity
and that there is no loss of service to the enterprise resulting from labor reductions. The average severance cost is
assumed to be Rs. 1.4 lakhs (about US$3,500) per employee based on the existing severance formula, actual
calculations for surplus staff in three companies, and the employment profile of staff (average wages and years of
service) in the other nine enterprises. However, some variations can be expected as actual severance payments
would be made according to the profile of individual staff.



Annex 4
Page 2 of 8
4.     In estimating the marginal productivity of workers elsewhere in the economy, it is assumed that not
everyone would be re-employed and that the probability of fmding work depends on the average age and skill level
of employees (white-collar, skilled and semi-skilled, unskilled), conditions in the AP labor market (unemployment
rate, poverty levels) and the assumption that many surplus workers are already aware that displacement is inevitable
and would have to find work as they cannot afford to remain unemployed. Based on the experience in other parts of
India (Gujarat, Kamataka, U.P.), at most 25 to 30 percent of workers are expected to find employment in the
organized sector while the rest are expected to find work in the informal sector or become self-employed. The
probability of finding work represents a weighted average for both the organized and unorganized sectors and
ranges from 0.74 to 0.87. Based on the staff profile of the surplus workers and labor market surveys of comparative
wages for different categories of workers, laid-off workers would most likely accept a wage cut ranging from 40
percent (for skilled workers) to 70 percent (for unskilled and white-collar workers). The probabilities are expected
to increase as a result of the training and counseling services provided.
Results
5.     The net present value (NPV) of the VRS program as a whole is estimated at Rs. 14 crores (about US$3.3
million) at a 12 percent discount rate. Its internal economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated at 17.4 percent,
reflecting the higher marginal productivity of workers outside the public enterprises even after reductions to
compensate for those unable to find work. The financial rate of return (based on the total cost savings) is 35.3
percent witlh a payback period of 2 years.
6.     These results are based the conservative assumptions discussed above. Sensitivity analyses show that if the
probability of fnding work goes up by 10 percent as a result of providing effective retraining, the estimated rate of
return would be increased to 19.5 percent. Increasing the probability of finding work within a year to 100 percent
on the asswnption that workers cannot afford to remain unemployed increases the ERR to 23.3 percent. Assuming a
further reduction in the wage coefficient, the ERR is still at an acceptable 15 percent.
7.     In summary, the program has a clear economic value under conservative assumptions. This value does not
stem from the fact that the workers are laid-off but rather because the redundant workers can be better used in other
sectors. The severance program also results in significant wage savings and better utilization of assets, releasing
scarce public resources that can be more productively used for social and other purposes.

Summay_of Benefits and Costs:
8.     The provision of minimum all-weather road accessibility is expected to yield substantial social and
economic benefits, which are not quantified. The empirical results from a village and rural household transport



Annex 4
Page 3 of 8
survey provide strong social and economic justification. Road closure during the heavy rainy season causes
produce wastage, delay of freight delivery, labor unemployment and lower school attendance. Road investments to
ensure all-weather passability are expected to benefit rural households through improved access to social, more
seasonal work outside villages, higher intensity of cultivation, and expansion of cultivated land. The sub-
component, at the total cost of Rs. 150.8 crores, would cover approximately 3,000 km of rural roads and directly
benefit about 2 million people, or 132 persons served per lahk rupee expenditure.
9.     The major benefits of road upgrading to black-top would be savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC) and
value of time (VOT) for both motorized and non-motorized transport (NMT). Both VOC and VOT savings are
expected to result from the improvement of road surface condition, which is measured by international roughness
index (IRI). Economic analysis shows that the proposed upgrading road works (a total of 1,300 km) would produce
an ERR ranging from 12 percent to 90 percent, averaging 20.0 percent for Adilabad, 24.1 percent for Karimnagar,
and 26.4 percent for Warangal. Total upgrading costs are estimated to be 101 crores, with an estimated total NPV
40 crores.
Main Assumptions:
10.    The traffic forecast for each road is based on data obtained in recent traffic counts (November to
December, 1997). A 5 percent annual growth rate is assumed for the entire project life of 15 years. It is based on
the actual income growth rate recorded for the last 5 years in the project area. Lower growth rates are assumed in
sensitivity analysis. No modal split changes are assumed for future years.
i1.    Total financial costs for each proposed road work are estimated by the Panchayat Raj Engineering
Department, based on most recent cost information. A standard conversion factor of 0.90 is used to convert the
financial costs into economic costs for the purpose of economic analysis.
12.    The road roughness based VOC estimates for motorized vehicles are obtained using local motor vehicle
basic cost information and the HDM-VOC model. The road roughness based VOC for NMT vehicles are also
estimated using local basic cost data and known parameters from relevant studies. The road roughness based travel
speeds for both motor vehicle and NMT vehicles are estimated by the Panchayat Raj Engineering Department based
on field experience.
13.    The value of travel tiime for an average rural road user, Rs.2.5 per hour, is based on recent year local per
capita income information. It is a conservative estimate.
Cost-effectiveness Indicators
14.    Rural population served per thousand dollars of investment is used as the primary cost-effectiveness
measure. In addition, empirical results from a village and rural household transport survey are used to assess the
socio-economic impact of rural road accessibility. In sum, 2.8 million population would benefit from the project,
representing an average cost-effectiveness of 1 1 1 persons per lahks rupees.
Sensitivity Analysis
15.    Sensitivity analysis was performed for the road works that were subject to a cost-benefit analysis. The ERR
estimates under alternative scenarios for three districts, shown below, indicate that the economic viability of the
road upgrading works is generally robust.

Distribution of Benefits
16.    There are three groups of beneficiaries: the road users, truckers and bus services. In AP, trucking is entirely
in the private sector, and passenger transport is mainly provided by a state-owned bus company. The rural trucking
services are reasonably competitive, and therefore road improvement is expected to benefit service users in lower
charges. The operation of the state bus company is currently subsidized. The road improvement would not likely
lead to a reduction of bus fares, but would benefit the company in reduced operating costs and the passengers in

shorter travel time, improved travel comfort, and perhaps expanded services.
3. Irrigation Component
Summary of Benefits and Costs
17.    The Irrigation Component would support irrigation rehabilitation, operation and maintenance (O&M) and
Water Users Associations (WUAs). The economic analysis quantifies the combined economic impact of the
irrigation cormponent, consisting of:
a) Scheme Performance Improvement consisting of minimum rehabilitation works in 10 major irrigation
schemes and 63 medium schemes and ensuring full financing and execution of recurrent operations and
maintenance (O&M) in the same major and medium irrigation schemes and in an additional 12,294 minor
irrigation schemes.
b) Irrigateid Agricultural Intensification Program (IAIP) including dissemination of information about
irrigated agriculture technology, training and skill development of the Agriculture Department extension staff
and upgrading of the irrigated agriculture extension service directed at WUAs.
c) Institutional Support consisting of the upgrading of skills of the Irrigation and Command Area Development
Department (I&CADD) and the newly created WUAs in the management of the irrigation systems.
d) Scheme Improvement and Farmer Turnover (SIFT) of O&M responsibilities as a pilot operation to Water
User's Associations (WUAs) and Project/Distributory level committees in three medium irrigation schemes and
portions of three major irrigation schemes in the three regions of the State.
18.    Increased agricultural output would be derived from: (a) the expansion of irrigated area in the irrigation
command areas and (b) improved yields. The reduction in water conveyance losses and the more equitable
distribution of water within the schemes (e.g. head-end vs. tail-end) would permit the expansion of the net irrigated
area. They would enable farmers to irrigate previously unirrigated farm plots as well as to increase the irrigated
cropping intensity. The total irrigated area in the project area, presently standing at 2.67 million ha, would reach 3.0
million ha at project completion augmenting production on some 0.33 million ha of presently unirrigated land. The
contribution of increasing net irrigated area is larger in the Coastal major, Rayalaseema minor and all schemes in the
Telangana region, reflecting the current limited water conveyance ability of canals in these areas. It is estimated
that, with the project, the total irrigated area would increase by about 15 percent in major schemes, about 10 percent
in medium schemes and about 5 percent in minor irrigation schemes.
19.    The gain in irrigated area is expected to be the highest in the major schemes since these are subject to
larger water losses resulting from poor management than medium and minor schemes. They are also more difficult
to maintain (leading to greater conveyance losses and inequities between head- and tail-enders), and they are prone
to water logging and poor drainage, particularly along the main canals and in the low lying areas. The participation
of WUAs in the management of these schemes is expected to generate lower management-related water losses
whereas the rehabilitation of the canal and drainage systems is expected to reduce water losses and water-logging
and to enable servicing of the tail reaches in a more significant manner than in smaller schemes.
20.    Project inputs would result in incremental agricultural production mainly consisting of paddy, cotton,
groundnuts, pulses and sugarcane, generating an annual value added to the local economy estimated at Rs.4.2 billion
(about US$118 million) in November 1997 prices. It is estimated that as a result of the project, the incremental
marketable agricultural production, mainly paddy, would generate sales tax revenues of about Rs.95 million per
year (US$2.7 million).
21.    It is estimated that a total of 2.5 million farm families or about 12 million people would directly benefit
from the project. The increased demand for farm labor at project completion would amount to about 15 million
man-days per annum equivalent to some 50,000 full time jobs. About two thirds of the manpower demand would
be supplied by hired labor, the majority of which consists of landless workers. Other positive employment impact
resulting from the expected increased agricultural production, which the mission was unable to quantify, would
include off-farm activities in the transport, marketing and agricultural processing sub-sectors. Construction of civil
works as foreseen under the project would generate a temporary five-year increase in local employment
opportunities since a large number of skilled and unskilled laborers would be employed by WUAs and I&CADD in
the rehabilitation works during project implementation.

22...   The impact of irrigation investments on production would occur gradually, allowing for a probable lag in
farmer response. Total incremental production has been estimated on the basis of crop budgets per ha by region and
by irrigation scheme. Incremental production has been calculated over current levels. If the current poor
management continued over the long term, it is in fact more than likely that agricultural production would follow a
declining trend. Thus the current analysis is based on very conservative estimates of agricultural impact.
Methodology and Main Assumnptions
23.    Impact. The economic impact of the irrigation component as a whole was quantified, covering the total
project area of some 3.0 million ha, including 2.3 million ha in the Coastal Region, 0.2 million ha in the
Rayalaseema Region and 0.5 rnillion ha in the Telangana Region. Representative models of farms in the major,
medium and minor irrigation schemes for each of the three regions were developed, as the basis for estimating
economic impact at the scheme and at the aggregate levels. The combined economic impact the first three irrigation
sub-components (Scheme Performance Improvement, Institutional Support and Irrigated Agricultural Intensification



Annex 4
Page 6 of 8
Program) was also estimated on five representative schemes in different regions of the State (the Nagarjunasagar
major scheme in the Coastal Region-428,434 ha-; the Coastal Region medium scheme-6,000 ha-; the Telangana
medium scheme-4,100 ha-; the Coastal Region minor scheme-100 ha-; and the Telangana minor scheme-l 0 ha-).
The Coastal amd Telangana medium and minor schemes are regionally representative models of schemes designed
to illustrate examples of farm areas with the highest and lowest productive potential in the State. In addition, the
vast majority (87 percent) of the medium and minor irrigation schemes are located in the Coastal and Telangana
Regions. The value of incremental production for these schemes was estimated using crop budgets per ha expressed
in economic terms.
24.    The economic analysis of the SIFT component was performed separately to examine the impact of the pilot
operation. The analysis was based on the assumptions that: (a) the total irrigated area at project completion would
increase by about 20 percent in the SIFT over the without project situation; and (b) the net value of production per
ha would be 10 percent higher than those used for the project as a whole. These assumptions were made because of
the effort that would be undertaken under the SIFT component to introduce new technologies (e.g. canal
automation) as a pilot operation in selected major and medium schemes covering a total of about 46,756 ha. SIFT
investment costs (excluding agricultural intensification and institutional support) per ha were estimated at about
Rs.24,200 per ha, well above the corresponding figure (i.e., rehabilitation) of about Rs. 1,860 per ha for the project
excluding SIFT. The value of the incremental agricultural production for the SIFT was estimated using crop budgets
per ha expressed in economic terms.
25.    Costs The cost of on-going civil works, technical assistance for the preparation of the PIP, the training
modules required for initiating the MIS, and the purchase of computers and office equipment required for project
launching were based on the actual tender costs. The costs of new civil works for both the rehabilitation and
recurrent maintenance works were based on best estimates and detailed engineering work conducted by ESCI
consultants. The cost of the minimum rehabilitation works was converted to economic costs by using a specific
conversion factor of 0.86, while the recurrent maintenance works, which require a mixture of equipment, material,
fuel, skilled and unskilled labor, were converted to economic costs by using a specific conversion factor of 0.88. A
Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.90 was applied to the remaining cost items. Incremental O&M in economic
terms were derived from the project cost tables. These were separately listed in the ERR analysis along with the
cost of the rehabilitation works.
22.    ReplLacement costs, estimated at Rs.450/ha, Rs.315/ha and Rs. 180/ha for the major, medium and minor
schemes respectively, were included in the analysis in line with the following schedule: 20 percent in year 11, 30
percent in year 12, and 50 percent in year 13. To approximate the required investments after year 20 to sustain the
life of the irrigation system further, an average replacement cost per year was included in year 20.
23.    The cost streams were based on the economic costs as calculated in the project cost tables (See Annex 12
of the Project Implementation Plans for details) and exclude taxes and price contingencies. In estimating the ERRs
for the specific irrigation schemes as indicated above, the costs of the agricultural intensification and the
institutional support components of the project were allocated proportionally according to the area of each sub-
project on the basis of the average cost per ha in economic terms as derived from the project cost tables.
24.    Yield Assumptions. Increases in yield derive from the improved reliability and timing of water delivery
and improved delivery of agricultural extension services. The yield of paddy, the most extensively cultivated crop
in the project area (over 90 percent of the total cultivated area), was conservatively assumed to increase by about 3
percent. The yields of other crops were projected to increase on average by about 5 percent to 10 percent. Crop
yields vary by crop and across regions to reflect differing productive potential in different locations. Yield
assumptions for the without project situation were based on data collected from the farmers by the Directorate of
Economics and Statistics (GOAP). Average yields for the last five years were used. For the with project situation,
the yields are best estimates of crop scientists based on experience in the State. Overall, the increased output
generated by the project largely derives from increased irrigated area with a smaller contribution of increasing
yields.
25.    Prics-traded ouut. The economic prices of paddy, sorghum, sunflower, groundnuts, cotton and
sugarcane were based on projected 2005 import/export parity prices (excluding taxes and duties) derived from the
November 1997 World Bank Commodity Price Projection and expressed in 1997 constant prices. The economic
price of paddy, following recent analysis carried out for India, was considered to be somewhere between export and



Annex 4
Page 7 of 8
import parity levels. Cotto:n was treated as exportable as recent data indicate that India is a net exporter of both
cotton lint and cotton seed meal. An import parity price was taken for sugarcane. The economic price of groundnuts
was estimated taking into consideration that India exports groundnut meal but imports oil.
26.    Prices-non-traded output. Other crops produced in the project area, for which no specific world market
reference price is obtainable (i.e. vegetables, pulses) and/or because of their limited representation in the project
area cropping pattern (i.e. sunflower), were considered as non-tradable. To derive their economic prices, their
financial prices were multiplied by the SCF of 0.9.
27.    Prices- inputs. Urea, DAP and MOP, the main fertilizers used in the project area were priced at import
parity taking into account the November 1997 World Bank Commodity Price Projections. A SCF of 0.9 was
applied to pesticides, other chemicals, organic manure and draft animals. The financial prices of seeds, which are
not subsidized and do not differ significantly from their respective economic values, were used in the economic
analysis.
28.    Labor. Average wages, by season for the Coastal, Rayalaseema and Telangana Regions were set at
Rs.32/day, Rs.27/day and Rs.30/day respectively. An overall average of Rs.30/day was used in the financial
analysis. There has been no detailed study of the shadow price of rural labor in AP. For the economic analysis
unskilled labor wages were converted to their economic prices by using a SCF of 0.90.
Results
29.    The ERR for the whole irrigation component is 38 percent, generating net benefits of Rs.9 billion. The
ERR for the different schemes range from 34 percent to 99 percent. As expected the ERR for a major scheme
Nagarjunasagar (98 percent) is significantly higher than for the medium schemes. The ERRs for the medium and
minor schemes are all above the opportunity cost of capital (assumed to be 12 percent) and exhibit regional
differences--reflecting regional variation in production potential. It should be noted that the ERRs for the medium
and minor schemes in the Telangana region provide an indication of returns in areas with lower production potential
in the State. A representative medium scheme in the Coastal Region would generate net benefits of about Rs.20
million and those of the Telangana Region about Rs.8 million over the 20 year project period. The economic rate of
return for a representative minor scheme in the Coastal Region is 99 percent generating net benefits of about
Rs.335,000, while those in the Telangana are 44 percent and about Rs.129,000 respectively.
30.    The ERR for the SIFT is 25 percent, but this derives from the higher level of investments involved in this
pilot operation. The present value of net benefits, computed at the discount rate of 12 percent, is positive and
indicates that the project as a whole as well as the individual schemes would be justified. As this would be a pilot
operation, opportunities for further increasing benefits and reducing costs would be explored during the process of
implementation. One potential source for reducing costs could derive from the demonstration effect of the pilot.
Sensitivity Analysis and Project Risks
31.    Sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic rates of return of the irrigation component and for the sub-
projects are robust to wide-ranging deviations from the base case assumptions. The switching value analysis for the
irrigation component as a whole shows that it would take a 55 percent decrease in benefits or a 146 percent increase
in investment and replacement costs to lower the economic rate of return to 12 percent. Similarly, for the SIFT
component, a 66 percent decrease in benefits or a 36 percent increase in costs would lower the economic rate of
return to 12 percent.
32.    The major risks pertain to: (a) less than 100 percent operational success of the WUAs, a key building block
of GOAP's irrigation strategy; (b) delays in implementation; (c) slower than projected farmer response to the
investment program resulting in delayed accrual of benefits and (d) implementation inefficiencies leading to higher
investment costs.
33.    The success of GOAP's irrigation strategy rests on the successful performance of the WUAs, particularly
on O&M. The impact on ERRs if only 80 percent, 70 percent and 60 percent of the WUAs become operational was
therefore investigated. The results indicate that at 70 percent and 80 percent WUA success rate, the project and its
sub-components would retain ERRs greater than the cost of capital. However, at 60 percent WUA success rate, the



Annex 4
Page 8 of 8
ERR of the SIFT would decline to 12 percent. Of the various sub-components, the SIFT pilot operation exhibits the
greatest sensitivity to WUA performance.

34.    Implementation delays could arise as a result of weak implementation, difficulties in the transition into
joint I&CADD and WUA management, and/or inadequate or delayed provision by GOAP of the counterpart
funding. The impact of possible delays in implementation was examined by spreading the investments over seven
years instead of five years and lagging benefits I year over and above the base case. The ERR results indicate that
the whole irrigation component would decline to 28 percent. The ERR of the SIFT would decline to 15 percent,
while the ERRs of the various schemes would decline to 33 percent to 80 percent.
35.     The combined impact of a 70 percent WVUA success rate and implementation delays indicate that the
whole irrigation component and its various schemes maintain their good economic standing. The ERR for the
irrigation component as a whole would be 23 percent and the individual schemes ranging from 16 percent to 51
percent. The SIFT component, however, would decline to 9 percent.
36.    The impact on ERRs of delayed farmer and farm output response to the investments as well as increasing
investment costs was investigated. The whole irrigation component, the SIFT and the various irrigation schemes
would holcl up well to delaying benefits by I or 2 years. The ERR of the whole irrigation component would decline
to 27 percent as a result of a I year delay and to 21 percent as a result of a two year delay. Despite increasing
investment costs by 25 percent and 50 percent respectively, the ERRs of the whole irrigation component as well as
the individual schemes are all above the cost of capital. It is only in the serious case when benefits are lagged 2
years and investment costs are increased by 25 percent that the SIFT component ERR (11 percent) would fall
slightly below the cost of capital. The whole irrigation component would still have an ERR of 18 percent.
37.     Overall, the project is robust to expected risks, as indicated by the results of the various scenarios examined
above. The base case ERR is itself based on modest increases in irrigated area and yield impacts. Recognizing that
a state-wide program such as this would entail varying performance by WUAs and irrigation schemes, average
estimated benefits have already accounted for expected mixed performance. The state-wide estimates are
significantly lower than results obtained under pilot programs. A 30 percent shortfall in WUA performance
combined with implementation delay, that would provide a reasonable assessment of downside risks, still results in
an overall ERR of 23 percent.

implemented by the I&CAD Department and Farmers Organizations without the assistance of the project. As
Farmers Organizations would be required to contribute 15% of the cost of civil works and 100% of O&M works,
these works would normally be implemented by these Organizations with their own labor force or through local
masons, or any other method on the basis of implementation plans approved by the I&CAD Department. In special
circumstances, such as a special request by the WUAs or when WUAs are unable to implement the approved

ANNEX 12
THE FISCAL FRAMEWORK
1.     Since the mid-1980s AP has been under substantial fiscal stress created by (a) declining own revenue of the
State as a share of GSDP, and (b) sharply rising public expenditures on subsidies, salaries, and poorly targeted
welfare programs, which have crowded out productive expenditure on infrastructure, social sectors, and non-wage
O&M. The situation were aggravated in 1994-94 and 1994-95 by introduction of total prohibition of sale of
alcoholic drinks and increased subsidization of rice distribution under the 2-rupee rice scheme. These two schemes,
which have imposed a burden of about 3 percent of GSDP on the State's budget, led to an unprecedented fiscal
crisis in 1994-95 and 1995-96. The spending plans of the Government were forced to fall in line with the resource
constraint. The burden of adjustment fell on productive expenditure while subsidies and salaries were largely
protected.
2.     The present Goveniment which took office in December 1995, has taken several politically difficult fiscal
and sector measures to reverse these trends including reduction in rice subsidy and staff in the State Government,
partial relaxation of prohibition on the sale of alcoholic beverages, introduction of a public enterprise reform which
has so far achieved privatization of two public enterprises and closure of four unviable companies, threefold
increase in irrigation charges, and enactment of a Power Sector Reform Bill which would trigger a series of
fundamental reforms in the sector. These measures constitute a sharp break from the earlier populist policies and a
significant step towards redefining the role of government in AP - reducing it where it can be efficiently replaced
by the private sector, and increasing it in the provision of essential public services such as primary education,
primary health, and road maintenance.
3.     The fiscal restructuring program of the Government for the next five years, supported by APERP, is a
continuation of the measures already taken in a broader fiscal framework. This framework is summarized after a
brief description of the main fiscal developments since the early 1990s. More detailed description and analysis of
the fiscal developments in a longer perspective can be found in the following documents on the project file: (a)
White Papers and the Fiscal Policy Statement of GOAP; (b) Bank's report "AP: Agenda for Economic Reforms"
(Report No: 15901 -IN, January 16, 1997); and (c) Aide memoire of the appraisal mission (April 6, 1998).
A BRIEF' REVIEW OF THE RECENT FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS
4.     From the point of vitew of fiscal stance, the 1990s can be divided into two periods. The first period (from
1990-91 to 1994-95) is characterized by serious fiscal deterioration. The second period (from 1995-96 to present)
shows signs of fiscal recovery. In the first period, most fiscal indicators deteriorated (Table 1); the fiscal deficit
increased from 3.3 percent of GSDP in 1990-91 to 3.8 percent in 1994-95, the revenue deficit and the primary
deficit rose from 0.5 percent and 1.1 percent of GSDP to 1.2 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively, in the same
period, and composition of expenditure deteriorated (The share interest payments, the salary bill, and subsidies
increased at the expense of productive expenditure on O&M, capital expenditure, and education and health). The
deterioration can be ascribed to the structural weaknesses in state finances (inelastic revenue system, rapid increase
in employment in the State Government, proliferation of subsidy programs, etc.) and, particularly, introduction of
total prohibition of sale of alcoholic drinks and increased subsidization of rice distribution by the previous
Government.
5.     The fiscal situation has improved markedly in the second period. The fiscal deficit has been brought down
from 3.8 percent of GSDP in 1994-95 to an estimated 3.0 percent in 1997-98. The revenue deficit and the primary
deficit have also been reduced from 1.2 percent and 1.8 percent of GSDP to 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent,
respectively, in the same period. Successful revenue mobilization has been a key factor in bringing about this
consistent improvement in fiscal situation. Both the State's own revenue and transfers from the Central
Government have increased in this period; 0.6 percent of GSDP in the case of own revenue and 0.4 percent in
transfers. The resulting increase in total revenue of I percent of GSDP enabled the Government to achieve a 0.8
point reduction in fiscal deficit while increasing total expenditure by 0.2 points.
6.     The own revenue increase of 0.6 percent of GSDP was a result of a 0.8 point increase in tax revenue and a
0.2 point fall in non-tax revenue. The revenue efforts such as introduction of a turnover tax and an increase in the



Annex 12
Page 2 of 9
motor vehicle entry tax are responsible for the own tax increase'. Decline in non-tax revenue is explained by the
fact that charges for many public services are on ad valorem basis, which are not adjusted frequently to keep pace
with nominal GSDP.

and Health
7.      Several steps have been taken in the second period to restructure the composition of expenditure. The rice
subsidy has been reduced by 41 percent from Rs. 1125 crores in 1995-96 to Rs.660 crores in 1997-98 (or, from 1.6
percent of GSDP to 0.7 percent). This was achieved by a large increase in the sale price and some reduction in the
entitlement per family in July 1996. Strong measures have also been introduced since 95, including freeze on
hiring, to contain sharp increase in employment in the State Government. It is estimated that these measures have
reduced employment by about 3 percent in the past three years and changed its composition in favor of social
sectors. As a result, the salary bill was reduced from 6.2 percent of GSDP in 1994-95 to 5.3 percent in 1997-98.
8.      A worrying development is that the budgetary savings from the reduction in rice subsidy and employment
have been absorbed by other unproductive expenditure. In particular, interest payments have increased from 2.0
percent of (iSDP in 1994-95 to 2.4 percent in 1997-98, reflecting higher real interest rates following partial
liberalization of the lending rates and a fall in inflation in recent years2. Pension payments have also increased from
1 A sharp fall in tax revenue in 1995-96 and an equally sharp recovery in 1997-98 is explained by introduction of
prohibition on the sale of alcoholic beverages and partial reversal of this policy in 1997-98.
2 The average real interest rate on government debt was estimated at 0.5 percent in the period from 1990-91 to
1993-94 and 3.4 percent since then. The average nominal rate in year t was estimated by dividing total interest
payments in year t+l by the outstanding debt in year t. All India CPI was used to calculate the real rates.



Annex 12

1.2 percent of GSDP in 1994-95 to 1.4 percent in 1997-98 partly offsetting the savings from employment reduction.
In addition, net loans and advances to APSEB have increased from 0.7 percent of GSDP in 1994-95 to 1.3 percent
in 1997-98. These loans are, in effect, indirect subsidies because they are used to finance the operating losses of
APSEB and, in later years, converted into grant or equity. An increase in these loans crowds out public investment
in infrastructure, because they are part of the capital expenditure of the budget.
9.     These developments indicate that containing the power sector subsidies and interest payments is critical in
achieving a notable change in expenditure composition, and that state finances cannot be made sustainable unless
the power sector is reformed and the fiscal deficit is further reduced to a sustainable level. The Government reform
program for the next 5-6 years -- described in the Letter of Development Policy (Annex 13) -- aims to address
particularly these two issues, while broadening and deepening the fiscal and sector reforms already initiated. The
proposed APERP and the power sector operation, which are being processed in parallel, are the main instruments
with which the Bank supports the Government to achieve these objectives.
10.    Fiscal Outturn in 1997-98. Fiscal improvements continued in 1997-98. The fiscal outturn was markedly
better than expected. With a revenue increase of 1.1 percent of GSDP lead by excise and sales taxes as a result the
relaxation of prohibition, and an expenditure increase of 0.7 percent of GSDP, the fiscal deficit declined by 0.4
percentage points to 3.0 percent against the budgeted 3.5 percent. Both the revenue deficit and primary deficit also
declined markedly.
11.    The 1998-99 Budget. Against this background, the 1998-99 budget aims to consolidate the earlier gains in
fiscal adjustment while maintaining the reform momentum. The fiscal deficit is budgeted to stay at the present level
of 3.0 percent of GSDP1. The expected revenue increase of 0.7 percent of GSDP (0.4 percent in own tax revenue
and 0.3 percent in transfers fromn the center which partly reflects the inflow of APERP funds) would finance partly
capital outlays and partly interest payments. The salary bill is projected to remain at 5.3 percent of GSDP despite
the planned reduction of employment in the State Government (see below) because the Government intends to fill
27,000 vacancies in the primary education sector in 1998-99. Expenditure on O&M is budgeted to increase from
1.2 percent of GSDP to 1.3 percent supported by APERP. Net loans to APSEB in 1998-99 is budgeted at 0.9
percent of GSDP, down from 1.3 percent in 1997-98, reflecting expected improvement in APSEB's financial
performance under the ongoing reform program. Capital outlays is budgeted to increase from 1.1 percent of GSDP
to 1.3 percent. The revenue deficit is estimated to remain very low at 0.4 percent of GSDP in 1998-99 (slightly up
from 0.3 percent of GSDP), and the primary deficit would fall further from 0.7 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to 0.4
percent in 1998-99.
THE FISCAL PROGRAM
Fiscal Objectives
12.    The fiscal restructuring program of the Government for the period 1998-99 to 2002-03 builds on the
progress already made in the past three years. It has three main objectives:
* Changing the composition of public expenditure, which would involve a fall in the share of untargeted
subsidies, the salary bill, and interest payments in total expenditure and an increase in the share of expenditure
on operation and maintenance, social sectors, and infrastructure. This would significantly improve the
development impact of public expenditure and ensure that adequate budgetary funds are available to implement
the investments APERP supports. Quantitative targets for expenditure composition have been worked out and
agreed upon with the state aiuthorities (see below). Restructuring of public expenditure also signify a new
antipoverty strategy based on acceleration of growth and employment creation, with smaller but better targeted
subsidy programs for the very poor.
* Containing the growth of GOAP' s debt and guarantees. This would require stabilizing the debt/GSDP and the
guarantees/GSDP ratios at about the 24 percent and 9 percent, respectively. This would, in turn, help stabilize
the share of interest payments in revenue at about 18 percent (These three ratios are below the average of all
The impact of APERL is estimated and incorporated in the 1998-99 Budget presented in Table 1.



Annex 12

states). The main fiscal implication of this objective is a further reduction in fiscal deficit from the present 3.0
of GSDE' to 2.5 percent by the end of the program. Annual deficit targets have been projected for the program
period atid agreed upon with the state authorities. Reduction in fiscal deficit would not be smooth and
continuous. In fact, the deficit is projected to deteriorate in 1999-00 when pay increase is expected to be
awarded (see below). Projections show that fiscal deficit would gradually fall to 2.5 percent of GSDP in 2002-
03 after going up to 3.4 percent in 1999-00.
*  Enhancing the revenue efforts, including an improvement of the tax system that broadens the revenue base and
increases buoyancy and efficiency through simplification and other administrative measures, and stronger cost
recovery. The specific measures include: preparation for a VAT to replace the present sales tax under technical
assistance funded by DFID of the UK Government, and enhanced cost recovery in canal irrigation.
Policy Measures
13.    The Government intends to take the following measures during the program period to achieve these
objectives.
* Staffreduction: The Government would continue reducing employment in the State Government and changing
its composition. To be able to accommodate the expected increase of about 52,000 new teachers in primary
education under DPEP and others which may be created by the Central Government under the centrally
sponsored schemes, the primary education sector would not be included in the staff reduction program. For the
rest of the sectors, an annual staff reduction target of 1.9 percent has been agreed. This would enable the
Govermnent to reduce employment in these sectors by 76,000 in five years (from 834,000 in 1997-98 to
758,000 in 2002-03), with natural attrition (Table 2). The rate of natural attrition is estimated at 2.1 percent.
Under this plan, total employment in the State Government is estimated to fall by 2.5 percent over the next five
years (about 0.5 percent a year). In addition, the composition of employment would change significantly. For
example, the share of primary education teachers in total employment would increase from 15 percent in 1997-
98 to 24 percent in 2002-03. In view of the rapid increase in pension payments, a paper would be prepared to
explore the options for a pension refonn in AP.

*Rice subsidy: The Government has already reduced rice subsidy by 41 percent from Rs.1,125 crores in 1995-
96 to Rs.660 crores in 1997-98 (or, from 1.6 percent of GSDP to 0.7 percent) by raising the sale price and
reducing the entitlement per family. The program now covers about 70 percent of the population. Further
rationalization of the scheme and better targeting are planned for. In particular, (a) to improve targeting, the
bogus (illegal) ration cards would be eliminated; (b) the design and implementation of the scheme would be



Annex 12
Page 5 of 9
improved to better target the subsidy to the poor; and (c) the existing food committees at all levels would be
strengthened to increase representation of the women's groups in order to better monitor the program from the
perspective of beneficiaries. In addition, a study would be undertaken to assess the impact of controls on rice
sales on the AP economy in general and on farmers in particular.
*   Irrigation: Irrigation charges were increased threefold in January 1997. They cover about 70 percent of the
required O&M costs. However, the collection rate is 60 percent. The Government intends to strengthen
revenue collection. The reform agenda includes: (a) the collection rate would be targeted at achieving at least
90 percent by March 31, 2001; (b) the Water Charges Review Committee (WCRC) would be fully
operationalized to make annual recommendations regarding the water rates to be levied and expenditure
requirements for O&M, (c) cost sharing of 15 percent for investment costs in minimum rehabilitation and SIFT
works in the area of operation of WUAs in cash and or kind, would be introduced; and (d) progress would be
made, on a pilot basis, towards introduction of volumetric charges for water and collection of water charges by
WUAs.
*   Tax measures: The Government intends to modernize the general sales tax system which accounts for about
two-thirds of the total tax revenue, by introducing a VAT after adequate preparation of about 2 years.
Preparation would be supported under a technical assistance program to be funded by DFID. A 5-day
workshop on VAT would be held in Hyderabad in late June 1998.
Replacement of the sales tax with a VAT would significantly improve the efficiency in resource allocation in
the State. By broadening the tax base, it would also have a positive impact on revenue. However, in conducting
fiscal projections for the program period (see below), it was assumed that introduction of VAT would be
revenue neutral. That is, the fiscal benefits of the improved tax system would be passed on to the tax payers in
terms of lower rates.
*   Expenditure management: The Government intends to improve the expenditure management. The following
would be the main elements of the program: (a) emphasis on better maintenance of the existing assets in
preference to starting new projects; (b) completion of the ongoing projects through critical balancing
investment before making fresh commitments; (c) selection of new projects and schemes on strict cost-benefit
criteria while taking into account both positive and negative externalities; (d) zero-based budgeting to evaluate
every scheme and phasing out ineffective ones; and (e) budgeting based on a realistic estimate of resources so
as not to overstretch comnmitments. Technical assistance would be identified to support the Government efforts.
Fiscal Impact of the Expected Pay Increase
14.    Pay policy in AP Government is not formally linked to the Central Government policies. Therefore, pay
adjustment in AP normally follows a different timetable and rate increase. Past practice indicate that roughly in
every five years, based partly on the recommendations of a state-level Pay Commission, a major increase has been
given. In between, salaries are adjusted for inflation with a structural increase of 1-2 percent in real terms. The last
pay increase in AP was about 115 percent in 1994. Following the recent large salary increase at the Center, the State
Government set up a Pay Commission to determine what additional increase would be needed. The Pay
Commission is expected to submit its recommendations by the end of 1998. Based on these recommendations and
negotiations with the staff, it is expected that the Government would announce the increase in 1999 before State
elections in November. The size of the increase and the way it is financed would have important implications for
the fiscal program.
15.    At this time, it is not possible to determine what the size of the increase would be. In fiscal projections,
conducted jointly with the Finance Department, it is assumed that (a) the increase would be 20 percent (to ensure
relative parity with the increase in Central Government); (b) it would be made effective from January 1, 1998; and
(c) all payments including arrears would be paid in 1999-00. This scenario which is considered by the authorities as
the worst case scenario, is adopted to have conservative projections in the first two years of the reform program.
The projections indicate that the wage bill including pensions would increase from 6.7 percent of GSDP in 1997-98
to 8.4 percent in 1999-00. It would then gradually fall to 6.5 percent at the end of the program period (Table 2).
16.    To mitigate the impact, the Government is considering several measures including spreading the payment
over a period of time particularly after 1999-00, introducing new revenue measures or VRS in departments where



Annex 12
Page 6 of 9
excess employment is high. These decisions would have to be made at the time the pay award is negotiated with the
staff and be part of the final agreement. It was agreed however that the 1999-00 Budget should be prepared and
resources to fnance the pay increase be identified very carefully to ensure that the priority expenditure is protected
in that year. The fiscal projections show that the expected revenue increase and further savings in other expenditure
categories would not be sufficient to fully finance the assumed pay hike, and that new borrowing would be
necessary. Irhis implies that a temporary deterioration in fiscal situation in 1999-00 is unavoidable (see below).
Impact of the Fiscal Program and APERP
17.    The main measurable impact of the fiscal measures would be: (a) revenue increase from improved cost
recovery in irrigation (as noted earlier, the actual revenue increase would be marginal); (b) budgetary savings from
reduction of rice subsidy (the rice subsidy would fall from 0.7 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to 0.3 percent in 2000-
01 if the coverage is reduced to 40 percent of the population); and (c) budgetary savings from staff reduction
program (the salary bill including pension payments would fall from 6.7 percent of GSDP to 6.5 percent at the end
of the program period after increasing to 8.4 percent in 1999-00. APERP itself would have three main effects.
First, APERP would increase total expenditure by the expected disbursement each year (0.34 percent of GSDP).
Second, it would increase revenue (0.2 percent of GSDP) in terms of grants from the Central Government because
some of the sector components are planned to be centrally sponsored schemes and the others passed on to the State
Government in 30:70 ratio of grant to loan. Third, it would change the composition of expenditure in a major way
through the sector projects it finances. The fiscal projections reported in the next section incorporates these effects.
Fiscal Projections
18.    Fiscal projections have been conducted in collaboration with the Finance Department to estimate the
impact of the policy measures included in the program, and determine monitorable fiscal targets for the program
period. The projections also reflect various assumptions related to inflation, GSDP growth, revenue buoyancy, etc.
(See the aid memoire of the appraisal mission for these assumptions and detailed projections). A summary of the
main results is presented in Table 1.
19.    The projections do not reflect the budgetary impact of the power sector reform program, in particular, the
financial restructuring plan for APSEB, under preparation in the context of the Bank's power sector operation.
Completion of this plan, discussion with all concerned parties, and agreement on the plan with the Bank and the
creditors is expected to take 10-12 months. The fiscal impact of this plan would be considered separately when it is
completed and agreed upon. However, to have realistic fiscal projections until the power sector reform is in place, it
is assumed in these projections that the net loans and advances to the power sector would be kept at 0.7 percent of
GSDP, down slightly from the budgeted 0.9 percent in 1998-99 in anticipation of the positive impact of the
measures being considered in the power sector.
20.    The financial restructuring plan for APSEB would estimate the funds needed for new investment by
APSEB and servicing its outstanding liabilities in a reformed power sector, and identify sources of finance. Some
of these funds need to be provided by the State Government which may be large in the initial 2-3 years of
implementation of the power sector reform program. Therefore, the fiscal deficit and some other fiscal indicators
such as the debt/GSDP ratio and the interest payments/GSDP ratio, are expected to deteriorate initially. But if the
fiscal sustainability of the power sector is attained, the positive medium-term fiscal impact of the power sector
reforms would far outweigh the initial negative impact. In fact, as noted earlier, fiscal sustainability in AP cannot be
ensured without radical power sector reforms.
21.    The pay increase is incorporated in the projections on the basis of assumptions summarized in para. 15. It
was agreed with the Finance Department that if the conditions of the actual pay settlement is fiscally more
comfortable than what is assumed (for example, the increase is lower than 20 percent, and the payment is spread
over a period of time), the fiscal projections would be adjusted accordingly during annual reviews of the program.
22.    The projections show that, with the exception of 1999-00, the overall fiscal situation would continue to
improve in the program period. In particular, after going up to 3.4 percent of GSDP in 1999-00 (reflecting the
impact of the expected pay hike), the fiscal deficit would gradually decline to 2.5 percent. If it is sustained, a 2.5
percent deficit would be one of the lowest among Indian states. The revenue balance and the primary balance would



Annex 12
Page 7 of 9
turn positive in 2000-01 and remain positive thereafter. AP would be the first state in India to achieve positive
revenue and primary balances.
23.    A key factor affecting fiscal performance is the expected revenue increase of 1.7 percent of GSDP which
would facilitate a 0.5 point reduction in fiscal deficit and a 1.2 point increase in total expenditure (mainly in the
social sectors and infrastructure). The revenue increase would come largely from the State's own taxes (one percent
of GSDP) reflecting the full impact of partial elimination of prohibition on the sale of alcoholic beverages on sales
tax and excise particularly in the first 2 years. The combined sales tax and excise revenue is projected to go up from
5.9 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to 6.6 percent in 1999-00. Transfers from the Central Government are also
expected to increase by 0.6 percent of GSDP on account of the grant element in the APERP funds and the expected
implementation of the new devolution formula for the central taxes recommended by the 10th Finance Commission.
24.    The 1.2 points increase in total expenditure is projected to be divided equally between the revenue and
capital expenditure. In particular, capital outlays (capital expenditure minus net loans and advances to public
enterprises) show an expansion from 1I.1 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to 2.5 percent in 2002-03, indicating
substantial increase in budgetary funds available for investment in infrastructure.
25.    The projections show that the debt/GSDP ratio and the interest payments/GSDP ratio would increase
slightly in the first four years of the program period because of higher fiscal deficit generated by the assumed large
pay increase. However, both rates would start declining in the final year. If the fiscal deficit is maintained at 2.5
percent of GSDP in later years, the debtWGSDP ratio would stabilize at 24 percent and the interest payments/GSDP
ratio at 2.9 percent, both below the average of the major states of India.
26.    The main impact of the program is on the composition of expenditvre. Allocations for non-wage O&M
would increase from 1.2 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to 2.2 percent in the fourth year of the program and remain at
that level thereafter while expenditure on salaries, transfers and subsidies decrease (Table 1). Similarly, capital
outlays (investment in infrastructure) would go up from 1I.1 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to 2.2 percent in 2000-01
and 2.5 percent in 2002-03. In terms of sectoral classification, the combined budgetary allocations for irrigation,
roads, primary education, and primary health would increase from 2.5 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to 4.3 percent
by the end of the program period (Table 3).
The Fiscal Targets
27.    Based on the fiscal projections, agreement has been reached on the following fiscal targets for monitoring
the overall fiscal performance during the program period.
I. Reduce the fiscal deficit by 0.5 percentage point in the program period from the estimated 3.0 percent of GSDP
in 1997-98 according to the following annual targets; 3.0 percent in 1998-99, 3.4 percent in 1999-00, 2.9
percent in 2000-01, 2.7 percent in 2001-02, and 2.5 percent in 2002-03.
2. Achieve positive revenue balance of 0.4 percent of GSDP in 2000-01 and keep it at least at that level thereafter.
3. Keep the guarantees/GS]DP ratio at or below the present average 9 percent.
4. Reduce employment in the State Government (excluding primary education) by 1.9 percent a year.
5. Reduce the salary/GSDP ratio from the estimated 5.3 percent in 1997-98 to 5.0 percent in 2002-03.
6. Increase total combined expenditure in primary education and primary health from the estimated 0.9 percent of
GSDP in 1997-98 to 1.8 percent in 2002-03 (approximately 0.18 points per year).
7. Increase expenditure on non-salary O&M from the estimated 1.2 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to 2.0 percent in
2000-01 and maintain it at least at that level thereafter.
8. Increase expenditure on capital outlays (excluding net loans and advances) from the estimated 1.1 percent of
GSDP to 2.2 percent in 2000-01 and maintain it at least at that level thereafter.



Annex 12

9. Improve targeting by eliminating the illegally held ration cards.
10. Increase the collection rate of irrigation charges at least to 90 percent of the collectable demand and maintain it
at least at that level thereafter.

Fiscal Sustainabilitv
28.     In designing APERP, fiscal sustainability was considered at both the state and the project level. At the
state level, putting state finances on a sustainable path is a critical objective of APERP. The Government aims to
achieve this objective by (a) stabilizing the debt/GSDP ratio at about 24 percent to contain the interest burden at 18
percent of total revenue (both below the average of all Indian states). This requires a reduction of fiscal deficit from
the present 3.0 percent of GSDP to 2.5 percent by the end of the program period; (b) improving development impact
of public expenditure through changing its composition to shift resources from salaries and untargeted subsidies into
social sectors and infrastructure; and (c) simplifying the tax system and improving cost recovery to strengthen
revenue mobilization.
29.     Fiscal sustainability of the project components is equally important. A project of this size would have
significant budgetary implications both during and after the project period. For example, the primary education
component would increase the number of teachers, salaries of which would have to be paid fully from the budget
after the project is completed; food costs of the nutrition component need to be provided from the budget; and
budgetary allocations for O&M in the irrigation and road sectors which would be raised to the required norms under
the project, would need to be kept at that level in real terms in the post-project period. The question is whether
adequate budgetary funds could be made available both during and after the project period to meet the required
expenditure to sustain the investment supported by APERP without crowding out other priority expenditure.
30.     The budgetary impact of the project (i.e., local funds needed for implementation of all components) would
amount to 0.2 percent of GSDP during the project period and 0.3 percent after the project is completed. This



Annex 12

increased budgetary burden would be manageable in the context of the fiscal reform program. It could be met
entirely from the budgetary savings from rationalization of the rice subsidy and staff in the State Government,
which would jointly constitute about 0.7 percent of GSDP at the end of the project period.

CHIEF  LIISTER
ANDHRA PRADESH :"
D.O.Lr.No.l 15 1S/Fin/CMP/98
Dated May 14, 1998
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,
1.    When I met you in October 1996 in New Delhi, I explained to you our
Government's vision of putting Andhra Pradesh (AP) on a path of sustainable growth and
development withi a clear focus on enhancing the quality of life of the poorest segments of
the people. I briefed you on our agenda in this regard which, you will please recall,
included wide rarging reforms in public finance management, emphasis on education and
health, infrastructure building, and providing a rational, credible, and transparent
macroeconomic environment. The Government of Andbra Pradesh is doing all that is
possible to mobilize resources, reorient expenditure priorities, and enhance the levels of
efficiency and productivity. The purpose of this letter is to request support from
IBRD/IDA for this reform agenda. Please allow me to give you a brief background before
I proceed to discuss the various components of the reform program.
Public finance management
2.    Despite its rich resource base and physical and geographical advantages, the gross
state domestic product (GSDP) of AP has grown only by 4.6 percent a year since the early
1980s compared to the national average of 5.2 percent. This has widened the disparity in
the living standards between AP and the rest of the country. At the heart of this economic
under-performance has been the deteriorating public finance situation. The main
characteristics of this have been:
*  Falling public revenue caused by inadequate cost recovery, and a tax system
characterized by low buoyancy and complex procedures;
*  Rapidly growing salary bill and interest charges;
*  Inadequate budgetary provision for physical infrastructure and for operation
and maintenance (O&M);
contd...

page 2 Of 11
* Inadequate allocations of funds for humnan resource development, especially
primary education and public health; and
* A rapid increase in loosely targeted subsidies.
Reforms already initiated
3.    Our Government is deeply conscious of the need to reverse these trends, for failure
to do so will pull the state down in a vicious circle of poverty and stagnation. On the
other hand, a credible fiscal reform package and sector reform programs, effectively
implemented, will push it up in a virtuous circle of growth and development.  In
formulating our reforn package, we were guided by three concerns. First, there should be
a harmonious balance between welfare and development expenditure so that the income
earning; capacity of the poor is enhanced even as the truly indigent are provided social
security. Second, we must move decisively towards making government more responsive
and accountable. In this direction, we have instituted moves towards social audit, public
disclosuire of information and time limits for decisions by government. Third, we must
reckon with the fact that most adjustment programs, across the world, have failed because
of opposition from vested interests and misapprehensions of the vulnerable segments of
the population. Enlisting people's participation and support has, therefore, been a crucial
element of our strategy. Towards this end, the Government has facilitated the formation
of community based organizations in every sphere. Over the past three years, self-help
groups, watershed management committees, village development committees, village
education and village health committees, joint forest management associations, water
users' associations (WUA) etc. have been involved in decentralization of development
initiatives.
4.    Furthermore, we published a series of white papers in June 1996 explaining to the
people as simply as possible the true state of our economic and financial situation and the
maladies afflicting our public finances. The white papers generated  an extremely
rewarding debate at public fora and in the media on the options available to the
Governrment. The white papers were also discussed in a special session of the Legislative
Assembly. Based on the feedback so received, our Government initiated a number of
fiscal and sector policy measures to contain further deterioration of the fiscal situation.
These measures include:
Fiscal measures
* A policy statement describing the fiscal restructuring strategy for the state was
issued by the Government in February 1996 to initiate discussion and build
consensus on the reform program. The strategy places particular emphasis on

page 3 of 11
changing the composition of public expenditure to improve its development
impact.
  Rice subsidy scheme was revisited and streamlined resulting in reduction of
subsidy as a percentage of GSDP from 1.6 percent to 0.7 percent in 1997-98.
*  We also rationalised the State excise policy to arrest smuggling and illicit
distillation (which incidentally contributed to increase of State revenue by
about 2.0% of GSDP).
* A staff review committee was established to examine the staffing issues in the
main Government departments. Strong measures, including a strict control on
hiring, were introduced to contain expansion of employment in the state
government. As a result of these measures, the employment declined and the
salary bill as a percentage of GSDP has come down. The composition of
employment has also changed in favor of the social sectors.
*  A broad public enterprise reform program has been initiated in the past three
years covering the state's 39 enterprises and over 40 cooperatives. A working
group was established lo recommend a reform program for each company. The
working group has already reviewed most of the small and medium size
enterprises. Its recommendations, which include privatization of several units,
closure of unviable ones, and merger and restructuring of the others, are at
various stages of approval and implementation. We have also introduced
voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) in some Public Sector Undertakings.
* Other revenue enhancing measures were taken in July 1996 including
introduction of a 1 percent turnover tax, a luxury tax on tobacco, and an 8
percent enitry tax on motor vehicles.
Power sector policies
*  We increased power tariffs considerably across all sectors.
*  A policy statement on the power sector was issued by the Government in
March 1997 to generate discussion and build support for the reform program.
The program has been widely discussed in the state with all concerned parties
including trade unions.
* Work on the preparation of a financial restructuring program for Andhra
Pradesh State Electricity Board (APSEB) has been initiated. This work is
expected to be completed in the summer of 1998.

* A Power Sector Reform Bill was approved by the State Assembly in April
1998, which will trigger a series of reforms including establishment of an
independent regulatory authority for the power sector.
Irrigation sector policies
t Water charges for irrigation were upscaled in August 1996. The new rates
would now cover about three-quarters of the required O&M needs. However,
the revenue collection rate, which is presently only 60 percent, needs to be
further improved.
! The Andhra Pradesh Farmers Management of Irrigation System Act was
legislated by the State Assembly in June 1997 to introduce participatory
management in the sector.
iO Over 10,000 WUAs were constituted in August 1997 covering the entire
surface irrigation sector. State-wide elections were held for the membe-s of
WUAs. A trining program for the managers of WUAs was started in October
1997. The WUAs will progressively take over the responsibility for the
mannaement and maintenance of the irrigation distribution network in the
state.
- A Water Charges Review Committee (WCRC) was constituted in December
1997. It will, on an annual basis, review and make recommendations on all
aspects of water charges and maintenance funding on an annual basis.
;  A policy statement for the irrigation sector, "Reforming the Irrigation Sector
for Sustainable Management and Development" was approved in May 1998 to
initiate discussion on the reform strategy and provide a fiamework for the
irrigation sector reforms.
Other sector policies
5.    We have launched a variety of new initiatives to take advantage of the emerging
opportunities following from economnic liberalization. Important among these are the
following:
*' We have streamlined the policies and procedures to attract private investment,
both domestic and foreign, into the state. I am personally chairing a high
powered State Investment Promotion Board, which acts as a one-stop shop for
according all approvals and clearances required by potential investors.

page 5 of 11
Recognizing the role of information technology as a new growth engine, we
have endeavored to create a policy and operational environment that would
attract entrepreneurs from across the world. The Software Development Park,
which will be commissioned in Hyderabad by October 1998, is attracting
interest from leading international software companies. Microsoft has already
decided to open a Software Development Centre in the park, the first of its
kind outside the USA.
* We are actively encouraging private sector participation in infrastructure
development. The first two private power projects in the country that have
gone on stream are located in AP. We have entrusted development of a new
port and the management of an existing port to private initiative. In the roads
sector, management of some existing roads and construction of new stretches
have been given to the private sector.
Impact of the r eforms
6.    The impact of these reforms has been positive. The fiscal deficit has been brought
down from 3.8 percent of GSDP in 1994-95 to 3.0 percent in 1997-98. The revenue
deficit and the primary deficit have also been reduced from 1.2 percent and 1.8 percent of
GSDP to 0.3 percenit and 0.7 percent, respectively, in the same period. The business
community reacted positively to the policy initiatives. AP has become one of the leading
states in attracting new investment. Growth has accelerated. The state's GSDP has
recorded an average 6.0 percent growth in the past 3 years compared to 4.1 percent in the
first half of 1990s.
Reform agenda aheasd
7.    The above measures have made a significant positive impact on revenue
mobilization, expenditure restructuring, and efficient provision of infrastructure services.
Even so, our Govemrnent recognizes that this is only a beginning and that much more
needs to be done. Accordingly, we intend to widen and deepen the process of fiscal
adjustment and sector reforms to restore the state finances to robust health, to put the
state on a high and sustainable growth path, to accelerate poverty alleviation, and to close
the gap between AP and the rest of the country in economic and social development. The
reform program, which will be implemented over the next 5 years, has the following six
main components:
a) Fiscal deficit reduction,
b) Expenditure restructuring;
c) Expenditure management;
contd...



- 6 -                            Annex 13
page 6 of 11
d) Revenue augmentation;
e) Public enterprise reform; and
f) Growth enhancing sector policies.
Fiscal deficit reduction
8.    A key component of our fiscal reforms is to keep the state's debt and interest
payments at a sustainable level. To achieve this objective, we plan to reduce the fiscal
deficit by 0.5 percentage points in the program period from an estimated 3.0 percent of the
state's GSDP in 1997-98 according to the following annual targets: 3.0 percent in 1998-
99, 3.4 percent in 1999-00, 2.9 percent in 2000-01, 2.7 percent in 2001-02, and 2.5
percent in 2002-03. This, we expect, would keep the debt/GSDP ratio at about 24
percent, which is below the average of the major states in India. We will also restrict
exteniding Government guarantees for debt raised by public enterprises to maintain the
guarantees to GSDP ratio around the present average of 9 percent. In addition, we plan
to achieve a positive revenue balance of 0.4 percent of GSDP in 2000-01 and keep it at
least at that level thereafter.
9.    As the above annual targets show, reduction in the fiscal deficit will not follow a
smooth trend because of the expected salary increase for the state government employees,
which has become inevitable following the large pay revision by the Central Government.
The fiscal deficit may actually deteriorate in 1999-00, the year the pay award is expected
to be implemented. However, the Government will make every effort to ensure that the
salary bill stays at a sustainable level in the budget and the expected increase does not
adversely affect priority expenditure. The Government will consider all necessary
measures to mitigate the impact including spreading the payment over a period of time and
introduction of VRS in some departments in the course of time. After the second year of
the reform program, we expect the fiscal deficit to decline to 2.5 percent as indicated
above.
10.   The planned reduction in the fiscal deficit will come 'mainly from an increase in
revenue rather than a reduction in expenditure. We expect the revenue/GSDP ratio to
increase by 1.7 percentage points over the next 5 years, which would enable the state to
increase total expenditure by 1.2 points (mainly to improve the social and physical
infrastructure) while reducing the fiscal deficit by 0.5 points over the program period.
11.   The above fiscal correction targets do not reflect the budgetary impact of the
planned financial restructuring of APSEB. As a part of the power sector restructuring
program, we are preparing a financial restructuring plan for APSEB, which, we expect,
will have significant implications for the budget in the initial years of implementation of the
power sector reform program. This impact and its financing will be separately considered
when the details of the APSEB's financial restructuring plan is prepared and discussed
with the Bank in the context of the proposed power sector loan.

page 7 of 11
Expenditure restructuring
12.   At about 17-18 percent of GSDP, public expenditure in AP is not excessive. What
is, in fact, required is not a reduction in public expenditure, but a radical change in its
composition aimed at reducing the share of interest payments, untargeted subsidies, etc.,
in total expenditure with corresponding increase in expenditure on operation and
maintenance, social sectors and infrastructure. This restructuring would significantly
improve the development impact of public expenditure and ensure that adequate budgetary
funds are available to complete and maintain priority projects. The following are the main
elements of our expenditure restructuring package.
13.   Rice subsidy: As noted earlier, the Government has already reduced the budgetary
impact of the rice scheme. The program now covers about 70 percent of the population.
Further rationalization of the scheme in both design and implementation to better target
the subsidy to the poor is under contemplation. In particular, the Government intends to:
(a) eliminate the bogus cards and keep the rice subsidy at current level as far as possible;
and (b) strengthen the existing food committees at all levels to increase representation of
women's groups to better monitor the program from the perspective of beneficiaries. In
addition, a study will be undertaken to assess the impact of controls on rice sales on the
AP economy in general and on farmers in particular.
14.   Government staffsize: Employment in the Government grew by about 3.7 percent
a year in the 1980s and early part of 1990s. As a result, the salary bill has been consuming
about half of the state's revenue. The measures taken in recent years have already made a
significant impact in containing this unsustainable growth. Reforms will continue to reduce
the size of government staff and to change its composition. Taking advantage of the
natural attrition rate of about 2.0 percent a year, employment in the government will be
reduced by 2.5 percent over the next 5 years, after allowing for a significant increase in
employment in the primary education and health sectors. This will be achieved by a 1.9
percent annual reduction of employment in all sectors excluding primary education. The
planned staff reduction is expected to reduce the salary bill/GSDP ratio from the present
5.3 percent to 5.0 percent by the end of the project period, although some increase is
expected in the next two years as a result of the salary increase referred to above. We are
also planning to initiate a study for reforming the pension system-L
15.   Allocationsfior operation and maintenance (O&M) works: Budgetary allocations
for non- salary O&M declined from 1.4 percent of GSDP in 1990-91 to 1.2 percent in
1997-98. This has substantially reduced the efficiency of public assets in physical and
social infrastructure. Inadequate O&M spending is a conmmon problem in all subsectors
but particularly acute ir. irrigation and roads. Actual O&M allocations are far short of
established norms. Moreover, a large proportion of these funds is spent on salaries. The
Government plans to bifurcate the O&M budget into works and salaries and to raise the
contd...



-8-                             Annex 13
page 8 of 11
works component to the required norms to enable efficient utilization of public
investrnent, particularly in irrigation and roads. The Government intends to increase total
non-salary O&M expenditure from 1.2 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to 2.2 percent in the
next 3-4 years and to keep it at least at that level thereafter.
16.   Allocation for education and health:  Social development indicators in AP,
particularly in education, are presently below the national average.  Allocations,
particularly for teaching and health material, are below the required norms and declining.
Total expenditure on education and health, for example, declined from 4.1 percent of
GSDP in 1990-91 to 3.6 percent in 1997-98. The reform program includes a substantial
increase in allocations for education and health with particular emphasis on achieving
universal primary education, girls' education, and strengthening primary health care
services. The Government is planning to increase public expenditure on primary education
and primary health from 0.9 percent of GSDP in 1997-98 to 1.8 percent by the end of the
program period. This will be supported by policy reforms in both sectors to increase the
quality, reach and effectiveness of the service.
17.   Capital investment: Expenditure on capital outlays (mainly direct government
investment in infrastructure) declined from 1.6 percent of GSDP in 1990-91 to 1.1 percent
in 1997-98. This has created a large infrastructure gap in the state and has become a
serious obstacle for economic and social development. The required investment in power,
roads, irrigation, and ports would be about Rs. 11,000 crores a year over the next 5-6
years. The present capital budget of the state is about 15 percent of this amount. The
Government is planning to increase the capital outlays from 1.1 percent of GSDP in 1997-
98 to 2.2 percent by 2000-01 and to further increase it to 2.5 percent by 2002-03. It is
clear, however, that public funds alone are not sufficient to meet the needs. Accordingly,
policies governing the infrastructure sectors arei being reformed to encourage private
investment, particularly in the power, road and port sectors.
Expenditure management
18.   The following will be the main elements of the program for improvement in
expenditure management:
*  Emphasis on better maintenance of the existing assets in preference to starting
new projects;
*  Completion of ongoing projects before making fresh commitments;
*  Selection of new projects and schemes on strict cost-benefit criteria, while
taking into account both positive and negative externalities;
*  Zero-based budgeting to evaluate every scheme and phase out ineffective ones;
and
* Budgeting based on a realistic estimate of resources so as not to overstretch
commitments.
contd...



- 9 -                          Annex 13
page 9 of 11
19.   The Government will seek technical assistance to improve the budgetary process
and expenditure management to achieve these objectives.
Revenue augnentation
20.   The pressing problem on the revenue side is the declining revenue to GSDP ratio.
The state's own revenue to GSDP ratio came down from 9.1 percent in 1990-91 to 8.8
percent in 1997-98. Transfers from the Center also declined from 5.6 percent of GSDP
to 5.2 percent, in the same period. The Govermment is determined to raise the state's own
revenue to GSDP ratio to a sustainable level through reformring the tax system and
strengthening the cost recovery efforts, particularly in the infrastructure sectors. Transfers
from the Center are also expected to increase because of the expected implementation of
the new devolution formula recommended by the 1 0th Finance Commission.
21.   The tax reform strategy will concentrate more on systemic changes (simplification,
base broadening, and rnore effective administration) rather than on rate increases. A key
tax reform under consideration is the introduction of a VAT to replace the general sales
tax, which accounts for about two-thirds of the state's total tax revenue. This would
require wide public discussion and adequate preparation for about 2 years under a
technical assistance which will include administrative reforms and training of staff and tax-
payers.
Public enterprise reform
22.   To reduce the budgetary cost of public enterprises, a privatization and reform
program is urgently needed. The Government wiMl continue irnplementing the program it
has introduced earlier. To ensure success, the administrative and institutional
arrangements lo design and imnplement the public enterprise reform will be substantially
improved. The Goverranent has set up a Cabinet sub-committee to be responsible for
irnplementing the progran. An Implementation Unit has been established in the Public
Enterprise Managemernt Bureau (PEMB) to support the Cabinet sub-committee. The
Implementation Unit and the PEMB will be strengthened under technical assistance to
perform the new broader role effectively.
23.   The Governmenrt is adopting a gradual and phased approach to the public
enterprise reform so as to build not only the institutional capacity for reform
implementation but also to generate public support for the reform process by
demonstrating the benefits of reform as well as the government's endeavor to contain and
mitigate social trauma that sometimes accompanies reform. As an initial step, 12 medium
and small size companies will be restructured and privatized in the next 3-4 years. A
safety-net program has been prepared to minimize the possible social imnpact of this
program, which includes counseling, financial advice, and retraining support. In the second

phase, ari action plan will be prepared for the rest of the enterprises and cooperatives in
the sugar and spinning sectors.
Growth enhancing sector policies
24. Power sector: The medium-term reform program of the Government includes
establishnent of an independent and transparent regulatory body, unbundling of
generation, transmission  and distibution, privatization of distrbution, if necessary,
corporationalization of companies that remaain in the public sector and managing them as
commerc:ial entities, and financial restructuring of APSEB. The Government is separately
discussing the strategy for the power sector reforns with the Bank.
25.   Irrigation: The Government will continue improving the policy and institutional
environment in the irrigation sector. In particular, (a) the efficiency of collection will be
increased to at least 90 percent by March 31, 2001; (b) WCRC will be fully
operationalized to make annual recommendations regarding the water rates to be levied
and expenditure requirements for O&M; (c) cost sharing of 15 percent will be required for
rehabilitation and system improvement works at the WUA level; (d) responsibility of
collection of water charges will be progressively transferred to WUAs; (e) on a pilot basis,
collection of water charges on volumetric basis by WUAs will be introduced; and (f)
transfer of O&M responsibility to WUAs will be completed.
World Bank support
26.    The Government is committed to the above program, and will make every effort
to raise the necessary resources to implement it effectively. The World Bank support
through the Andhra Pradesh Economic Restructuring Loan is requested to supplement the
Government's own resources. The Bank funds will be utilized for the following purposes:
(a) Primary education: significant progress towards universal primary education with
particular focus on the girl child through expansion of the DPEP program; (b) Primary
health: Improving the quality, reach and effectiveness of the primary public health
services; (c) Nutrition: improving the nutrition and health status of young children and
women by expanding the Integrated Child Development Scheme, and improving service
delivery; (d) Roads: Increasing expenditure on non-wage O&M works in the roads
sector, upgrading selected rural roads and improving the management of road
maintemnnce; (e) Irrigation: Raising O&M expenditures in the irrigation sector, to the
required levels and rehabilitating selected schemes; and (a) Public enterprise reform:
Financing VRS in enterprises that are proposed to be privatized or restructured.
27.   Technical assistance will also be needed to support implementation of various
components of the programn. The following three areas have already been identified for
technical assistance: (a) introduction of VAT: to assist the Government to formulate a
VAT preparation plan, (b) public enterprise reformn and privatization: to support the

Government's on-going public enterprise reform and privatization program by creating a
transparent and effective institutional framework and financing the preparatory work and
implementation of the reform program; and (c) a safety-net program to finance retraining
of the employees affected by the public enterprise reforms.  The Department for
International Development (DFED) of the British government has agreed to fund these
technical assistance programs. In addition, I request the World Bank help identify
technical assistance for improving the budgetary process and expenditure mnagement.
Expected impact of the reform program
28.   The Govermnent expects the economic impact of fiscal restructuring to be
substantial. The fiscal situation will become sustainable with increased revenues, radically
changed composition of expenditure and a reduced fiscal deficit. We expect the
restructuring program will create a virtuous circle, in which fiscal and accompanying
sectoral reforms will enable the state to rebuild its infrastructure, stimulate private
investment, accelerate growth, create employment for a larger segment of the population,
and raise incomes at all levels. The growth rate of GSDP is expected to exceed the
average growth rate of the nation, gradually reducing the gap between AP and the country
as a whole in economic and social development.
29.   The Government of AP, therefore, requests approval of $543.5 million of support
from IBRD/IDA to complement and support its economic restructuring strategy.
