        URBAN III - PHASE II AND LABOR INTENSIVE PUBLIC WORKS

                                   RESTRUCTURING PAPER




SUMMARY
1.       The proposed restructuring is necessitated by recent changes in the project
implementation environment, including the overall governance structure for solid waste
management (SWM) in Conakry, and accumulated increases in prices of materials and
other construction inputs with no additional funds available to meet resulting financing
gaps. The changes proposed are aimed at concentrating efforts on a priority program of
coherent activities to be funded by the remaining project proceeds. Project restructuring
for the Urban III – phase 2 includes: (i) cancellation of SWM activities and reallocation
of the corresponding proceeds within the project; (ii) extension of project closing date
from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013 to provide enough time for full completion of
the revised program of activities; and (iii) revision of the project results framework to
better account for realistic results attributable to the restructured project. The
restructuring was formally requested by the Government of Guinea on November 25,
2011. Since the project is in problem status, which is primarily due to the country
context, Regional Vice President’s approval for the closing date extension is required.

2.      The restructuring will be used as an opportunity to formally integrate the Labor
Intensive Public Works Program (LIPW) to the Urban III – phase 2.1 As a result, the
outcomes and outputs expected from the LIPW will be included into the results
framework of the parent project to create the conditions for reporting as one project,
including through a single Implementation Completion Report once all activities will be
completed. Also, the closing date of LIPW will be extended in order to align with the
parent project.


PROJECT STATUS
3.      The US$15 million Urban III – phase 2 operation aims at improving (i) the
provision of infrastructure and services in Conakry and secondary cities, and (ii) the
financial and organizational management of municipalities in support of the
decentralization process. The financing was approved on August 14, 2007 with an
original closing date of December 31, 2011. Urban III – phase 2 was reactivated in April
2011 after over two years of freeze following the 2008 coup. To date, the project
disbursement rate is about 38 percent against a commitment rate of 47 percent. The

  While the Labor Intensive Public Works (LIPW), funded under the Global Food Crisis Response
Program, was prepared as an AF to the Urban III – phase 2 (the parent project), its reporting has been done
so far through a separate ISR from the parent project. The proposed restructuring is formally integrating the
AF to the parent project, henceforth both will be reported as one project both in terms of ISR and ICR.
                                                     4
US$2.5 million additional financing (AF), aimed at providing an emergency urban labor-
intensive works program to increase the purchasing power of the poorest, was reactivated
on February 14, 2011 with retroactive extension of its closing date from September 30,
2009 to December 31, 2011.

4.      The Urban III – phase 2 is currently rated marginally unsatisfactory (MU) on both
Development Objective (DO) and Implementation Progress (IP). All municipal contracts
foreseen between the State and the project cities were signed in mid-2008. The
implementation of the Conakry municipal contract (component 1) has resulted in an
additional 91,000 people provided with access to improved roads in Conakry before the
freeze of project activities. However, the quality of SWM services2 has deteriorated due
essentially to the lack of regular financing of collection and transfer activities, combined
with parallel and uncoordinated initiatives at the institutional level. This eventually
resulted in privatizing all SWM activities. With regard to the municipal contracts for
secondary cities (component 2), no substantial outcome has been achieved so far. As part
of institutional strengthening (component 3), the project has reported substantial
increases in municipal revenues, but this remains to be confirmed by analysis of data and
their attribution to project’s interventions. Implementation of the LIPW has been
marginally satisfactory with about 70 km of neighborhood drains cleaned and roads
rehabilitated. Also, 4,098 jobs were created (against a target of 5,300) and wages
distribution to workers represented GNF 5.6 billion (against a target of GNF 7 billion). In
addition, about 625,000 additional people, as project’s indirect beneficiaries, have been
provided with protection against flooding, improved environmental livelihoods or
improved accessibility to urban services against an initial target of about 300,000
additional people. The project management is rated MU following the departure of the
project coordinator. The recruitment of the new project coordinator is underway.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and safeguards compliance are also rated MU due to
inadequate collection and treatment of data and the deterioration in the SWM with some
negative environmental and social impacts. Procurement and financial management are
both rated marginally satisfactory and continue to improve since the reactivation of
project’s activities. Annual audits have been timely undertaken. There are no overdue
audits and the internal control and management system remain sound.

5.      Implementation of the Urban III – phase 2 has started to pick up pace since the
relaunch of project’s activities. Work on road rehabilitation in Conakry has resulted in the
rehabilitation of 6 km of roads against a target of 16 km because of lack of funding. Ten
new work sites have been opened in five of ten secondary cities, with works expected to
be completed in early 2012.3 The institutional strengthening activities are starting with
planned visits to all secondary cities by the PCU. With regard to the AF, satisfactory
progress has been made in the last few months in project implementation.

6.      Following the September 2011 restructuring mission and workshop attended by
all relevant parties (including all participating project municipalities), it was agreed to
2
  Quality of SWM was relatively good at the end of the phase I of the Urban II project in 2005, but has not
been sustained over time because of a difficult country context.

  All ongoing works are related to construction and equipment of about 78 classrooms, including
administrative offices as well as latrines in such schools, where needed, in the cities of Boké, Kankan,
Kindia, N’Zérékoré and Siguiri.

build on the existing SWM system, based on an autonomous public entity (SPTD) in
charge of waste transfer, and to drop all activities related to disposal due to a planned
privatization of land filling. Subsequently, the government opted for an approach built on
full privatization of transfer and disposal, and a second restructuring mission was
undertaken in November 2011 to revisit the initial restructuring proposal. The resulting
restructuring approach presented in this Restructuring Paper was agreed with the
Borrower and all participating municipalities. A time bound action plan has been agreed
with the government to improve project’s performance and ensure satisfactory
completion at exit, including a performance-based management of the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) and the hiring of a consultant to support environmental and
social aspects. The Bank is also strengthening its implementation support to the PCU
through quarterly assessment of project’s implementation progress with targeted field
visits and virtual meetings based on comprehensive progress reports.


PROPOSED CHANGES

•   Results/indicators

7.      The proposed changes consist of: (i) revision of PDO indicators; (ii) revision of
the target values for some indicators; (iii) incorporation of core indicators when relevant,
and (iv) integration of the intermediate results of the AF to the parent project’s results
framework. This will allow reflecting both objectives of the PDO and their monitoring,
the cancellation of SWM activities, the scaling back of activities for all three components
to focus on those that can be implemented as a coherent program, and integrating
reporting for the two operations, including Implementation Status and Results Reporting
and Implementation Completion and Results Reporting. Also, the restructured results
framework will place focus on outcomes and outputs that can realistically be achieved
over the duration of the restructured project and are attributable to the project.

8.      The PCU has experienced some challenges for accurate and timely reporting of
project results, which can be partially explained by the country context and lack of recent
data on population, but also by a weak coordination of M&E activities within the PCU.
Substantial work has been carried out in the context of the restructuring exercise to revise
baselines and set realistic targets and to present a clear M&E methodology to be used for
the remainder of the project. The restructured results framework is presented in Annex 1,
including detailed notes on data sources and methodology. The French translation of the
restructured results framework and M&E methodology has been discussed in detail with
the PCU during restructuring missions and is fully agreed upon. It will be incorporated
directly into the project implementation manual and should greatly improve the PCU’s
ability to report accurately and regularly on project results. Project outcomes will be
measured against the revised and new indicators and new target values.

•   Components




                                             6
9.       The three components remain the same, but the scope of activities for all of them
will be reduced as a result of concentration of efforts on a priority program of relevant
activities likely to foster successful implementation of the project as restructured.

10.     For Component 1 (Municipal Contract for Conakry), the Priority Investment
Program will retain investments in: (i) neighborhood upgrading, but with a reduction in
the number of km of roads rehabilitation to be financed under the project from 16 to 7.6
km, and (ii) administrative, socio-public, commercial, and environmental facilities, but
with a reduction in the number of municipal sub-projects from 10 to 4. All activities
related to SWM will be dropped, since the changes to the governance structure of SWM
and the resulting impacts of this change have not been sufficiently clarified for the Bank
to continue provide funds for any part of the SWM system. For the Municipal
Adjustment Program for Conakry, activities related to support the establishment of a
solid waste management system will be cancelled while the remaining categories of
activities will be maintained but their scope reduced and refocused on realistic activities
to be carried out by the municipalities.

11.      The scope of Component 2 (Municipal Contracts for Secondary Cities) will
similarly been reduced. The Priority Investment Programs for Secondary Cities will
retain the activities in infrastructure and administrative, socio-public, commercial, and
environmental facilities. However, only 20 sub-projects out of a planned 40 sub-projects
will be retained, with each city benefiting from at least one investment sub-project. The
Municipal Adjustment Programs for Secondary Cities will retain activities in all areas
foreseen under the original project, but with their scope reduced and refocused on
realistic activities to be carried out by the municipalities.

12.     Component 3 (Institutional Strengthening) will focus on critical activities that
have a strong likelihood to be effectively implemented during the lifetime of the
restructured project and with potential impact on municipalities for budget management.
Therefore, the following activities will be dropped: (i) street addressing activities in all
communes but Dixinn, Kaloum and Matam; (ii) improvement of fiscal registers in all
communes but Dixinn, Kaloum and Matam; (iii) support to the National Directorate of
Taxes; (iv) all activities related to urban management; and (v) the study on
intergovernmental transfers since it has been financed from other sources. The
restructured project will continue to support local government budget documentation
through training to municipal staff, provision of IT to the National Directorate of
Decentralization and support to updating the financial ratio guidebook. Finally, the
project’s closing date extension will result in increased costs for the PCU and the project
will continue to finance communication and information dissemination activities,
technical assistance to project implementation, technical and financial audits, and support
to safeguard implementation.

13.     The reduction of project’s scope will not affect its capacity to contribute to
improving urban infrastructure and services quality in the targeted cities. The same level
of resources will remain available to cities as initially granted in their municipal contract
agreements. In addition, decentralization remains a major reform agenda for the
authorities; hence the relevance of the proposed restructuring which will be resulting in
targeted amendments to the existing municipal contracts.

•     Safeguards

15.      Under the restructuring, the category of the project will remain the same
(Category B) and O.P. 4.01 and 4.12 will still be triggered. The current MU rating for
safeguards is due to lack of adequate monitoring of safeguard issues from the PCU and
the ministry of environment as well as limited ability to manage the social and
environmental impacts of the degraded SWM system. With the cancellation of SWM
activities and the hiring of a consultant by the PCU to support monitoring and reporting
on the implementation of environmental and social aspects of the project, management of
environmental and social aspects should improve to ensure full compliance with
safeguards requirements.

•     Institutional arrangements

16.    As a result of the decision to concentrate the project on a priority program, the
municipal contracts for all participating municipalities will be amended to reflect the
reduced scope of investment activities and to provide improved information on the
                                              8
criteria set for evaluating municipalities’ performance. The staffing of the PCU will also
be revised to drop the position included in support of SWM. The project implementation
manual will be amended to incorporate all these changes.

•   Financial management

17.     The proposed cancellation of activities related to SWM will entail changes to the
project funding. Specifically the following three existing accounts will be dropped from
the project: (i) SPTD operating costs account funded by the City of Conakry; (ii) SPTD
assets depreciation; and (iii) SMEs equipment guarantee, with both accounts funded by
the National Budget. The financial management, currently rated MS, has improved since
the project resumed activities. Annual audits have been timely performed and no audit
report is overdue. The independent auditor issued an unqualified opinion on 2010
financial statements and the internal control system remains adequate.

•   Closing date

18.     The closing date for the Urban III – phase 2 is proposed to be extended from
December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013 to allow for full implementation of the project as
restructured. Accordingly, the closing date for the AF to the Urban III – phase 2 is
proposed to be extended from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013 to allow alignment
with the parent project.

A detailed calculation of indicator values is available in the project file. The comments below provide information as background to the restructured results framework.

(1) Direct project beneficiaries includes all persons benefiting from project interventions, including those counted under access to roads, water, and sanitation in the results framework,
plus beneficiaries benefiting from other investments in secondary cities and not separately accounted for in the results framework, such as health centers, schools, and market
infrastructure. Direct project beneficiaries further includes the beneficiaries of the Labor Intensive Public Works Program as AF to the Urban III – phase 2.
(2) The original PAD indicator related to SWM measured percentage of the population having access. Original baseline does likely not reflect the actual situation at appraisal, due to
use of outdated population data. The total number of households was set at 158,198, based on the 1996 census, and 113,903 households were served, giving 72 percent, as in the PAD.
A more realistic 2005 baseline, taking into account 4% population growth, is 56 percent, based on 113,903 households served out of an estimated total of 195,705 households in 2005.
Since then, access rates have fallen, due to lack of regular financing of solid waste collection, with a reversal of the negative trend in 2011.
(3) The indicator is to be dropped. The project has reported substantial increase in municipal own revenues as well as issuance of tax rolls and collection of fiscal revenues, but this is
not confirmed by analysis of data and also not attributed to project interventions (due to the project freeze). The remaining project period will not allow the project to attain measurable
and attributable results regarding increase in municipal own revenues and fiscal revenues.
(4) Efficient system to manage commercial infrastructure is defined as evaluated and chosen by the municipal council and for which the type is clearly identified: (a) specifying
management « in house » but with nomination of a manager accountable to the council and with clearly defined and contractual minimum objectives; or (b) concession of management
to a private entity (e.g. association of stall holders, professional operator), with regular payment of specified amounts, for which the intervals and procedures for revision are agreed and
clearly spelled out in a contract. Such system shall in any case include a public hygiene component regarding solid waste management and operation of latrines. A management system
is set in place based on the following principles: (i) Inventory of assets and numbering of market stalls and stands, and parking spaces in the case of transport infrastructure; (ii)
Negotiation between the council and traders/transport operators on the use of proceeds; (iii) Estimate of the financial situation of each category of assets (tables, stalls, shops, parking
spaces) and growth projection over three years; and (iv) Evaluation, negotiation and adoption of the system of management most beneficial to the commune. All of these principles are
to be respected if the system is to be considered efficient in terms of the indicator, whether option (a) in house or (b) concession is chosen.
(5) Issues regarding this indicator are similar to note (2). The original PAD baseline does likely not reflect the actual situation at appraisal, due to use of outdated population numbers.
The total waste generated in 2005 was estimated at 321,200 cubic meters at appraisal, based on the on the 1996 census (population of 1.1 million) and an estimate of 0.4 cubic meters
(0.8 liters) of waste generated per person per day. This gives a collection rate of 80 percent (256,960 cubic meters collected by SMEs in 2005). A more realistic 2005 baseline, taking
into account 4% population growth and slightly denser population (8 persons per household, as estimated by the National Statistics Department), is 56 percent, based on the same
256,960 cubic meters reported as collected by SMEs out of an estimated production of 457,168 cubic meters in 2005 (estimated population of 1,565,643 times 0.8 liters per day). Since
2005, collection rates have fallen, due to lack of regular financing of solid waste collection, and the amount of solid waste collected by SMEs has decreased. The revised estimate
(2010) is 19 percent of total waste generated collected by SMEs. This is based on 102,784 cubic meters collected out of an estimated production of 556,214 cubic meters in 2010.
(6) In line with other SWM indicators, the original 2005 baseline and annual performance has been revised to take into account projected population growth and related increased waste
generation. SPTD is currently only transferring about 20 percent of the waste produced, compared to a total transfer rate of 62 percent by all transporters. This is due to a number of
emergency operations during 2011, during which other operators than SPTD have been paid to transfer accumulated waste. In preceding years (and especially in 2009), solid waste
transfer has also been carried out by other operators than SPTD, in the absence of regular financing for SPTD.
(7) Original indicator commingled construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance. The project originally targeted rehabilitation of 16 kilometers of roads.
(8) For the restructured project, it is specified that 3 percent of budgets of the City of Conakry and the 5 communes corresponds to GNF 728,148,651 in 2010 (3 percent of GNF
24,271,621,725, total revenues for Conakry and the 5 communes in 2010). This is set as the minimum amount to be spent annually on routine maintenance by the City of Conakry and
the 5 communes for the duration of the project. A definition and positive list of infrastructures for which maintenance is to be credited is to be promulgated during a workshop in
Conakry, and further included in as an annex to the revised municipal contracts.
(9) The indicator measures the number of programs effectively prepared and implemented by the City of Conakry and the 5 communes, based on an inventory of assets and analysis of
maintenance needs. In order to be considered as implemented, at least 80 percent of activities contained in the PMP has to be implemented, corresponding to at least 80% of the budget
allocated. A definition and positive list of infrastructures for which maintenance is to be credited is to be promulgated during a workshop in Conakry, and further included as an annex
to the revised municipal contracts.

(10) Original cumulative target was 40 infrastructures in secondary cities, revised down to 20 infrastructures cumulative, due to cost increase. Maintenance activities will be accounted
for separately, under the indicator on maintenance budget and maintenance programs implemented.
(11) Not a core indicator, as the “Improved Sanitation Facilities? core indicator specifically excludes public or shared facilities.
(12) For the restructured project, it is specified that 3 percent of budgets of the secondary cities corresponds to GNF 154,882,120 in 2009 (3 percent of GNF 5,162,737,335 total revenue
for the 10 municipalities in 2009, last year of fully available data). This is set as the minimum amount to be spent annually on routine maintenance by the secondary cities, for the
