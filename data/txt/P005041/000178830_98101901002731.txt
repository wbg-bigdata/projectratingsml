I. MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT FOR INDUSTRY AND CONSTRUCTION
The Industrial and Construction Sectors
1.01     Egyptian industry has a large potential for growth given its
proximity to promising markets in Europe and the Middle East and a large and
rapidly growing domestic market. Since Egypt's agricultural prospects are
limited, and the service sector is already overstaffed, it is to industry that
the Government looks to provide stimulus to growth through continued
expansion, efficient import substitution and increased exports, as well as to
absorb the growing labor force. Starting in 1974, the performance of industry
has improved considerably and the sector's output has grown at an average rate
of about 8% annually during 1974-81. In FY81, industry accounted for about
15% of the GDP, was responsible for 13% of commodity exports, and employed
about 1.5 million people or nearly 13% of the domestic work force. The
1982/83-86/87 Plan includes growth targets averaging about 10% annually for
industry. In order for Egypt's industry to play a more dynamic role and thus
provide the momentum for sustained economic growth, it will be necessary to
overcome several existing constraints, prominent among which is an inadequate
supply of skilled manpower. The development of an efficient vocational
training system to complement an industrialization strategy is, therefore, an
essential ingredient of Egypt's economic development process.
1.02     The construction sector is also vital to the Egyptian economy.  The
development of virtually all sectors including industry, power, transporta-
tion and, in a period of rapid urbanization, housing, is affected by the
capability of the construction sector. And the performance of the sector, in
the 1970s has been an impediment to the achievement of the Government's
development goals. The 1982/83-86/87 Plan includes growth targets averaging
about 7% annually for construction. As in the case of industry, a sizeable
shortage of skilled manpower is among the key constraints faced by the sector;
therefore, there is an immediate need to rapidly build up a supply of
well-trained construction workers and simultaneously work towards creating a
strong cadre of construction management personnel.
Training of Skilled Manpower for the Industrial and Construction Sectors
1.03     In attempting to meet demand for semi-skilled and skilled manpower,
the Ministry of Education (MOE) has made commendable efforts to increase
enrollments in the three-year, grades 10-12, secondary technical schools
(Annex 1, Table 2).  These schools are divided into industrial, commercial and
agricultural schools and are intended to prepare trained manpower for these
sectors. While total enrollments have grown by about 76% since 1976, the
quality and relevance of the instruction provided by the secondary technical
schools is severely affected by their poor physical state, outmoded and
inadequate practical equipment, outdated curricula and the poor qualifications
of the technical instructors. The MOE three-year program will be included in
the study of technician and skilled worker training programs to be conducted



- 2 -
under the ongoing second education project during 1983.  In order to meet
critical manpower needs, ministry-organized training outside the formal
education system has, with Bank assistance, expanded and diversified
dramatically over the last five years. The major ministries involved in
training are the Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources (MOIMR), the
Ministry of Development, Housing and Land Reclamation (MDHLR), and the
Ministries of Health, Agriculture, and Social Affairs. Of these ministries,
MOIMR and MDHLR dominate in terms of numbers of trainees, centers, and
expanded capacity. Between 1978 and 1981, enrollments in MOIMR and MDHLR
vocational training centers (VTCs) increased by 23% and 105%, respectively.
1.04      Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources (MOIMR).  This ministry,
through its Productivity and Vocational Training Department (PVTD), has
specific responsibility for training employees in the major industrial skill
areas for the large public enterprises which dominate the industrial sector.
These companies provide employment for approximately 60% of the total labor
force in manufacturing industry.  In addition, the PVTD provides skilled and
semi-skilled labor for private industry, and private sector firms participate
in the PVTD program. The PVTD was established in 1957 with assistance from
the International Labour Organization (ILO). To carry out its training
responsibilities, the PVTD maintains a country-wide network of 37 VTCs, 10
in-plant training centers, and an Instructor Training Institute (ITI). It is
directed from Cairo (with a branch office in Alexandria), and some curriculum
development, instructor training and related services are provided by the ITI,
also in Cairo. In an attempt to organize its training system more
effectively, the PVTD recently divideci the country into ten regions and
established in each a Regional Consultative Council composed of
representatives of the employers and educators in the region, and PVTD
officials. These Councils provide guidance in the operation of the training
centers.
1.05      Through its network of training centers, the PVTD conducts three
types of programs: (a) apprenticeship--a three-year program in which trainees
are full-time in the training center i-n the first year, two days per week in
the center (the remainder on-the-job) during the second year, and one day per
week in the center (the remainder on-the-job) in the final year. Trainees are
admitted to this program after successfully completing the preparatory level
of the formal system; (b) accelerated courses of various duration for persons
between 15 and 30 who can read and wri'te; and (c) upgrading courses for
workers.
1.06      Over time and for various reasons the number of students attending
the accelerated and upgrading courses has diminished considerably. Today,
over 90% of all PVTD trainees attend the three-year apprenticeship program,
which covers 15 trade areas (metal, electrical, electronics, automotive,
mining, metallurgy, maintenance, heat treatment, printing, precision
mechanics, textiles, chemicals, air-conditioning and refrigeration, leather
processing and glass processing). Skill-training is provided in 72 different
fields of specialization within these general trade areas. This list reflects
the diversity of Egyptian manufacturing industry and indicates the heavy
burden placed upon the PVTD to meet the skilled manpower requirements of all
these sectors.   Enrollments in the PVTD VTCs were about 8,400 in 1981 and are
planned to increase to about 17,000 by 1990.

1.07      Ministry of Development, Housing and Land Reclamation (MDHLR).
Within this Ministry, the Training Organization (TOMOHAR) is attempting to
meet the manpower needs of the entire construction industry.  TOMOHAR provides
basic training for the building and construction trades and supervises some
training which private companies provide internally. It offers three types of
courses; (a) six- to eight-week management courses for site supervisors; (b)
special courses of one or two weeks for technician type training; and (c) a
six-month program of basic construction skill training, which comprises four
months instruction in the training centers followed by two months of
supervised work experience. TOMOHAR's main effort is in this latter type of
training. Training is provided in 10 specializations, namely: masonry,
tiling, plastering, steel reinforcement, formwork, carpentry, painting,
plumbing, metal work, and electrical work. In addition, there are three
instructor training centers, of which two are presently operational while the
third will become operational in 1983. In 1981, TOMOHAR centers enrolled some
7,500 trainees. When TOMOHAR completes the construction and development of
its VTCs, annual enrollment will rise to about 53,000.
1.08      The link between training and employment is very close for both MOIMR
and MDHLR, since training is tailored directly to particular industries and a
proportion of the training period is spent on-the-job in a sponsoring
institution. Both MOIMR and MDHLR are major employers of the output of their
own training centers and maintain liaison with other employers to ensure the
continuing relevance of the training. Staff in both MOIMR and MDHLR are
confident that training center graduates are finding ready employment in their
trades, a finding which has been substantiated by a recent study for the MDHLR
carried out using technical assistance (TA) provided by the Federal Republic
of Germany. Both Ministries wish to have improved information on the
employment of their graduates and TA will be provided for this purpose in the
proposed project (paras. 2.16 and 2.17).
Major Issues in the Training of Skilled Manpower
1.09      The major issues which relate specifically to the training of skilled
manpower for the construction and industrial sectors are; (a) skilled manpower
shortages; (b) provision of instructors; and (c) manpower planning and
coordination of technical and vocational education.
(a) Shortages of Skilled Manpower
1.10      Shortages of appropriately trained technicians, skilled and
semi-skilled labor, coupled with a surplus of poorly trained labor, have beset
the Egyptian economy since the early 1970's, when higher rates of economic
growth were achieved and when labor migration occurred among these skill
groups. Since 1974, the Government has made a major effort to alleviate this
problem by increasing the amount of vocational and technical training provided
in the country. However, during the period 1950-73, very little training of
this type was provided and, as a result, the stock of teaching facilities,
technical teachers, teaching materials, and suitable buildings is still very
low, despite the various efforts of government and development agencies. The
Bank has been assisting in this effort since 1977 and the ongoing projects,
together with the proposed project in the sector, would, when completed, make
a significant contribution towards alleviating some of the manpower
deficiencies.



- 4 -
1.11     According to Bank mission estimates (based on government data),
taking emigration into account, the supply of skilled and semi-skilled workers
from TOMOHAR training centers for the construction sector will meet some 85%
of annual demand by 1992. In the industrial sector, the planned output of the
MOIMR VTCs together with the output of the MOE secondary technical schools
will meet 59% of the annual demand for skilled and semi-skilled workers by the
same year, as Table 1 shows. Neither of these estimates takes account of the
upgrading requirements of the existing labor force, which are substantial.
The shortfall between the demand for skilled labor and its available supply
has several causes. One of these is low wage rates in the public sector,
which are determined by government regulation. Equally significant is the
limited training capacity of the MOIMR which will take time and substantial
effort to build up.
1.12     In the face of this shortfaLl, the construction and industrial
sectors will continue to recruit frorm the substantial numbers of dropouts from
the formal education system (Annex 1, Table 2) whose programs do not provide
adequate job skills.

(b) Provision of Instructors
1.13     The Bank has assisted with the development of instructor and teacher
training facilities in various ministries under the first, second and third
education projects. The project completion report (under preparation) for the
first education project has highlighted the urgent need to increase the supply
and quality of instructors for the VTCs. The MOIMR ITI (para. 1.04) was
established in 1964 with ILO assistance to prepare instructors for the VTCs
and training officers for industry. However, its equipment is now obsolete
and in urgent need of replacement and the curricula needs to be revised
accordingly. The ITI is included in the proposed project (para. 2.12). In
the construction sector, the supply of instructors for the TOMOHAR VTCs will
come from the three instructor training centers (para. 1.07) supported under
the first education project. The duration of the existing instructor training
course is inadequate and assistance will be provided in the proposed project
to expand it from three to six months (para. 2.06). The following table shows
the anticipated demand and supply of instructors in MOIMR and MDHLR during the
periods 1982-87 and 1987-92;

1.14     While increased provisions are being made for instructor training,
the Ministries are also tackling a second problem--low motivation amongst
instructors. For example, technical school graduates of the formal system who
are instructors are unenthusiastic about their employment, preferring to
proceed to university. Skilled craftsmen, on the other hand, who, with
additional training, could work as instructors are in high demand both within
the domestic economy and abroad and can earn up to four times more in the



- 6 -
private sector as craftsmen than as instructors. The result is that
instructors tend to be poorly motivated and inexperienced. Practical
instruction also suffers as a result of the bias towards theory in the
education system and the physical absence of materials and equipment. A major
constraint to instructor training at the MOIMR ITI in Cairo, which would be
addressed in the proposed project, is the high cost of lodging for
participants from outside Cairo. To make employment prospects more
attractive, MDHLR has introduced an incentive system, and MOIMR is preparing
to follow suit. Both ministries are also examining various options for
recruiting new instructors, including the use of part-time instructors from
industry for practical instruction.
(c)  Manpower Planning and Coordination of Technical and Vocational Training
1.15     The Bank and other agencies, including the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) and ILO, have supported government efforts
to plan human resource development in Egypt. This support has been necessary
because human resource planning is in its infancy, despite the country's
experience in central planning. Recent efforts to undertake manpower planning
have been hampered by the rapidity of social and economic change, a general
lack of functional data, a lack of coordination between ministries and
different agencies, and the particular environment created by government
recruitment policies. The Government recently set up a task force of leading
Egyptian economists who are currently examining this and other issues.
1.16     In the last seven years, the relationship between education and
training policy and economic developnient has not been clearly articulated.
Enrollments have increased at all levels (Annex 1, Table 2), the proportional
share of secondary technical education has been increased, and the system has
become more diversified and flexible. At the same time, ministry and
project-related training has grown rapidly. The Government has recognized the
need to improve the coordination of technical and vocational education by
creating in 1981 a Central Committee for Orientation and Supervision chaired
by the Minister of Education, whose members are drawn from the ranks of
professional educators, education administrators and planners and
representatives from public and private sector industries. It is anticipated
that this difficult and complex issue will require a great deal of time and
perseverance by the Central Committee before it can be satisfactorily
resolved. The MOIMR is guided by a Consultative Council for Training in
Industry comprising representatives of the Government and the public and
private sector industries whom the MOIMR training centers serve.
Finance of the Education and Training System
1.17     In 1981, educational/training capital expenditures, as a percentage
of total central government capital expenditures, were 2.7%, while
education/training recurrent expenditLures were 11.0% of the total government
recurrent expenditure. During 1975-1980 the total education expenditure was
about 3.1% of GDP, slightly low compared with other countries of similar
development in the region.  Within the overall education/training budget,
there is a disproportionate emphasis on general secondary and



-7-
university education, to the detriment of basic, vocational and technical
education. In 1979/80, university enrollment accounted for only 3% of all
enrollment in the formal education system, but received 29% of all resources
allocated to the formal system. This uneven distribution of resources has
been much commented upon in Bank documents and by such agencies as USAID, but
there is no sign of new policies that will change the position. The practice
of providing government jobs to university graduates, combined with an open
admission policy to higher education, encourages students to pursue university
studies, thereby maintaining or elevating the already disproportionate
emphasis on higher education.
1.18     Training budgets for the MOIMR and MDHLR have been rapidly increasing
in recent years. During 1975-81, the MOIMR's recurrent expenditures increased
at an annual rate of 17.1%, while capital expenditures rose 59% per year.
Similarly, the MDHLR's recurrent and capital training budgets have been
increasing by 23% and 40% per year, respectively, during 1978-82.  During the
next five years the training budget for MOIMR will increase at an average
annual rate of about 22% for recurrent costs and about 25% for capital costs.
During the same period the MDHLR budget will increase at about 29% for
recurrent costs and about 24% for capital costs per year. These increases for
both Ministries indicate the rapid expansion of industrial and construction
training programs and the high priority placed on them by the Government.
The Bank's Role in Education and Training
1.19     The main theme of the Government's education and training strategy in
the 1982/83-1986/87 Plan is the rapid development of skilled manpower to meet
the economy's needs. Emphasis is to be placed on: distributing training
opportunities equitably with special attention to the needs of the regions;
correcting the imbalance between the demand for and supply of manpower with a
major focus on industrial training; improving the quality and relevance of the
skills of the new and existing labor force; and strengthening the
institutional base for manpower development.
1.20     The Bank's support for education and training in Egypt has been
consistent with the Government's priorities, prime among which are the
establishment of a stock of skilled manpower, a better balance between the
demand for labor and its supply, and equity in the distribution of
opportunities.
1.21     In support of the sector, the Bank has lent a total of US$105 million
for three projects.  The main focus of these projects is to expand and upgrade
the training of managers, technicians, and skilled and semi-skilled workers in
industrial, agricultural, construction and commercial trades; improve and
expand teacher and instructor training in selected areas; achieve modest
improvements in education and manpower planning; and provide limited support
for health education. The project completion mission for the recently
completed first project has concluded that the project succeeded in achieving
its main objectives. Enrollments and annual outputs of project institutions
are expected to meet project targets by 1984. The studies on education and
manpower planning did not, however, result in improved manpower planning.
Accordingly, a more focussed effort in this area is planned for MDHLR and
MOIMR in the proposed project. The second and third projects are ongoing, and
the overall progress is good.



--8-
1.22     In view of Egypt's continuing need to prepare manpower to carry out
the high levels of investment planned, the Bank proposes to build upon the
ongoing support for the vocational training programs in priority sectors.
Construction and industry would be emphasized and special efforts would be
made to ensure that training programs support the Government's objective of
achieving a more balanced regional distribution of industry. As experience is
gained under the third project, agricultural training could be developed
further. Separately, assistance planned for the construction sector will help
develop a strong management cadre. Over the years, a good rapport has been
established between Bank staff and the agencies responsible for training; this
should prove very helpful in our continuing cooperation in the sector.
II. TiHE PROJECT
Introduction
2.01     The proposed project was prepared by the Government following a Bank
project identification mission in December 1981 and a subsequent Bank
preparation assistance mission in February 1982. The project was appraised in
June 1982.
Objectives and Scope
2.02     The project would assist the Government in implementing priority
vocational training programs which are fully consistent with its economic
development strategy. The project objectives are as follows.
(a)  to increase the quantity and quality of trained manpower in the
construction sector by establishing 22 new VTCs for the construction
trades, and thereby completing the program begun under the first
education project, and to establish a new training materials
production center to develop new and improve existing instructional
materials;
(b)  to increase the quantity and quality of trained manpower and
instructors in the industrial sector by establishing one new VTC, by
extending and/or re-equipping five existing VTCs and one existing
ITI, and by developing new and improving existing instructional
materials; and
(c) to improve the planning, management and evaluation capacity of the
training departments in the MDHLR and MOIMR by providing TA.

2.03     The project would include provision of construction/extension, and/or
equipment and furniture for:

a/  Four VTCs (Alexandria, Tanta, Mansura and Sohag) will operate on a
double-shift basis and therefore enrollment and outputs from these centers
will be doubled. The estimated annual output figure of 730 includes the
doubled output from the 4 VTCs.
In addition, the project would provide TA; (a) related to the above project
components (232 man-months of specialists' services and 340 man-months of
fellowships); and (b) for institution building (66 man-months of specialists'
services and 62 man-months of fellowships) to improve the capabilities of
MDHLR and MOIMR to plan, manage and evaluate vocational training programs.
Vocational Training Centers--Construction Trades (MDHLR)
2.04     This component would include construction, equipment, furniture and
TA for 22 new VTCs.  The 22 new centers would, together with the 43 centers
established under the first and second education projects, complete the
TOMOHAR Five-Year Plan (1982-86) to establish a national network of 65
4        construction trades training centers and meet some 85% of the demand for
skilled and semi-skilled workers. The 43 centers provided under the first
(completed) and second (ongoing) education projects are successfully meeting
major project objectives (para. 1.21). The new centers would provide urgently
needed skill training opportunities for low income groups and would reduce
regional inequalities in the availability of vocational training opportunities
through the dispersed locations of the training centers among various outlying
Governorates (see Map).



- 10 -
2.05     The 22 new VTCs would offer initially six-month basic vocational
training courses for 10 construction trades (carpentry, masonry, painting,
tiling, plastering, plumbing, formwork, metalwork, electrical, and steel
reinforcement). Each center would have a capacity of 300 trainees (30
trainees per course). The 22 centers would have a total annual input of
19,800 trainees and an estimated annual output of about 18,000 from the
six-month courses (four months in the VTC and two months in on-the-job
training). While there are no formal education entrance requirements for
TOMOHAR trade courses, trainees have to be literate and at least 15 years of
age. Trainees currently receive a daily allowance of LE 0.75 and a daily food
ration and, in addition, receive a basic tool kit before leaving the centers.
Employment prospects for graduates are excellent. Based on the experience
with the 43 centers provided under the first and second education projects, no
difficulties are anticipated in receiving adequate numbers of qualified
applicants. As the supply of graduates begins to meet the immediate and
urgent manpower needs of the construction industry for basic skills, the
duration of the training courses will be increased to 8 months and to 10
months for some of the more complex trades with a resulting increase in the
level of skills. The new expanded course structure will permit an increase in
theoretical instruction (from the current 10% to 20% of training time) to
reflect the higher level of skill .in the new courses.  TOMOHAR long-range
plans also include provisions for introducing skill-upgrading courses at the
VTCs for the existing work force and this will be a topic included in the
Bank's ongoing dialogue with the Ministry.
2.06     The 660 instructors required for the 22 new VTCs would be supplied
from the estimated 300 annual output of the three instructor training centers
established under the first education project (para. 1.07). Currently, the
duration of the instructor training course is only three months but the course
will be expanded and its duration increased to six months by June 30, 1986 in
order to increase the quality of instructor output.  Assurances to this effect
were provided during negotiations (March 1983). The TA component would
include the services of an instructor training planning specialist (three
man-months) to assist TOMOHAR in planning and organizing the expansion of the
instructor training course (para. 2.17). The TA component would also include
66 man-months of fellowships for onae senior instructor from each of the 22
VTCs to assist in updating and upgrading their technical and teaching skills
for improved teaching performance. Twenty-two man-months of fellowships would
be provided for the new VTC directors to update and upgrade their planning,
organization and management skills.
Instructional Materials Center (MDHLR)
2.07      This component would include equipment, furniture and TA to establish
an instructional materials center at the existing VTC at Tenth of Ramadan City
to meet the needs for audio-visual aids and printed instructional materials
and to supervise and coordinate the curriculum development activities in the
other VTCs. This VTC is designated as TOMOHAR's future headquarters and
adequate space is available for the instructional materials center which will
include sections for audio-visual aids production, maintenance of audio-visual
equipment, a print shop, a technical reference library and a curriculum
development coordinating unit.



- 11 -
2.08     TOMOHAR has already commenced revising and updating its conventional
training materials for the 10 trade courses into a modular, performance-based
format with bilateral assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany. This
project is being executed by the ILO utilizing the ILO "modules of employable
skill" approach. However, this effort includes only 2 (electrical and
masonry) of the 10 trade areas and additional TA is required to complete this
major curriculum effort. The TA component for the instructional materials
center would, therefore, include 124 man-months of expert services and 16
man-months of fellowships to complete the preparation of modular,
performance-based training materials for the remaining eight TOMOHAR
construction trade courses (carpentry, plumbing, painting, tiling, plastering,
formwork, metal work, and steel reinforcement). In addition, 24 man-months of
expert services and 18 man-months of fellowships would be provided for the
audio-visual aids sections. Staffing of the proposed instructional materials
center with qualified personnel would be a critical factor in its success.
Therefore, the Government has agreed to appoint at least three full-time
personnel (for audio-visual aids production, audio-visual equipment
maintenance and printing) on a permanent basis to the instructional materials
center to coincide with the arrival of the audio-visual aids specialists
(scheduled for June 1984) and to be their counterparts.
Vocational Training Centers--Industrial Trades (MOIMR)
2.09     To alleviate the severe shortage of skilled workers in the industrial
sector, the project would provide construction/extension and/or equipment,
furniture and TA for one new and five existing VTCs. Eleven of the MOIMR's 37
VTCs were assisted under the first education project and were successful in
meeting major project objectives (para. 1.21). The one new VTC to be
established under this project would be located at Sohag (population about 2
n4ll14n) in Middle Egypt where the regional expansion of small-scale industry
is severely constrained by the acute shortage of trained workers. The five
existing VTCs are located in well-established and expanding industrial areas
(Alexandria, Assiut, Aswan, Mansura and Tanta). The project would provide
extension and/or additional new equipment and replacement of old equipment in
the five existing centers and construction and new equipment and furniture for
the Sohag center. The six VTCs would have an estimated enrollment (with
double shifts at four VTCs) of about 2,440 (12% women) with an annual output
of about 730 skilled and semi-skilled workers for the automotive, electrical,
metal, chemical, air-conditioning, maintenance and printing trades. The
apprenticeship trades program consists of one year of formal trade training
with equal time allocated to theory and practice followed by two years of
on-the-job training in selected local industries with additional theory
instruction for two days and one day per week in the second and third years,
respectively. This program, which has been in existence for more than 10
years, requires updating (para. 2.16). For admission to the apprenticeship
program, trainees must have completed preparatory school and be over 15 years
of age. The drop-out rate from the apprenticeship program is currently about
10%.
2.10     The existing training materials for four apprenticeship courses
(automotive, fine mechanics, metals and electrical) need to be updated and new
training materials need to be prepared for three additional courses (chemical,
printing and marine engines). This project component would, therefore,



- 12 -
include 114 man-months of fellowships for 25 senior instructors and 18
man-months for 3 curriculum specialists to update existing and prepare new
training materials for the seven courses. Selected instructional materials to
be developed at the ITI (para. 2.14) would, with minor modifications, also be
utilized in the VTCs. A total of six man-months of fellowships would be
provided for the directors of the six VTCs to update their knowledge of
organization and management of VTCs.
2.11     The estimated 140 instructors (70 practical and 70 theory) required
for the new VTC and for the new courses to be added to the five existing VTCs
would be selected from the estimated 200 annual output from the MOIMR ITI.
Instructor Training Institute (ITI)--MOIMR
2.12     This component would provide:  (a) additional equipment and furniture
and replacement of old equipment and furniture for existing courses; (b) new
equipment and furniture for five new courses; (c) construction of a new
dormitory building; and (d) TA for the existing MOIMR ITI at Cairo. The
objective of the component is to increase the supply and quality of industrial
trade instructors for the MOIMR's VTCs. The ITI has a current capacity of 150
trainees. The one-year instructor training program includes trade theory and
practice, pedagogy and practice teaching. The program requires expansion and
updating (paras. 2.13 and 2.14). Trainees are selected from technical
secondary school graduates and graduates of the three-year apprenticeship
program. All trainees are expected to have a minimum of three years
industrial trade experience. Graduates work as assistant instructors for
three years in the VTCs under the supervision of senior instructors and are
then appointed as instructors for classes of 8 to 15 trainees according to
area of specialization. Employment prospects for ITI graduates in the VTCs
and in industry are excellent.
2.13     The capacity of the ITI would be expanded from 150 to 225 trainees by
adding five new courses in television, electronics, air-conditioning,
automatic control and instrumentation. Adequate space is available within the
ITI for the additional laboratories and workshops required for the new
courses. Additional classroom space for theory instruction would be provided
on the second floor of the new dormiltory building for 100 resident trainees,
to be constructed under the project. The provision of a dormitory building at
the ITI will improve enrollments as the high cost of lodging in Cairo is a
major constraint to recruitment of trainees.  The provision of boarding
facilities would also increase the vocational training opportunities for
students from remote areas.
2.14     The TA to be provided to the ITI would include the services of 8
specialists (tool and diemaking, metals, electrical, automotive,
air-conditioning, mechanical measurement, television and electronics) for a
total of 66 man-months to assist with the updating of existing and development
of new instructional materials, the installation of new equipment and training
ITI staff in its use, and assisting staff in the implementation of the new
curricula.  Ninety-six man-months of fellowships would be provided for 16
senior instructors to improve their capabilities in advanced instructional
methodology and to visit ITIs abroad to upgrade their knowledge of the
state-of-the-art in instructor training in their respective fields.



- 13 -
Additional Technical Assistance
2.15     In addition to the provision of the technical assistance (232
man-months of specialist services and 340 man-months of fellowships) for the
project components above, the project would also include a total of 66
man-months of specialist services and 62 man-months of fellowships for staff
development in the MOIMR and MDHLR. The specialist services would also cover
the preparation of a possible follow-up project.
2.16     For the MOIMR, this component would provide 9 man-months of
specialist services and 36 man-months of fellowships to upgrade the ministry's
apprenticeship system. An additional 12 man-months of fellowships would be
provided for project management staff to strengthen the capability of the PVTD
staff in planning, management and evaluation of vocational training programs.
This limited TA for staff development at MOIMR would complement a substantial
TA program financed by USAID for institutional strengthening.
2.17     For the MDHLR, this component would include the services of 5
specialists (training systems, administration, financial planning, data
systems and instructor training planning) for a total of 51 man-months and 2
man-months of fellowships to upgrade and expand TOMOHAR's planning,
organization, management and data systems. An additional 12 man-months of
fellowships would be provided for project management staff to further
strengthen TOMOHAR's capabilities in planning and management of vocational
training programs.
2.18     The Government would assign at least one counterpart for each
specialist included under the TA program. The counterparts would be assigned
on a full-time basis upon the specialists' arrival in the country.

3.03     Basis of Cost Estimates.  Estimated civil works costs for the
proposed project are based on unit prices derived from current contracts for
similar institutions and from construction industry cost data and were
adjusted for regional cost differences. Furniture and equipment costs are
X         based on current CIF unit prices and on standard costs per place in similar
institutions and are adjusted upward to include local transportation and
installation. Project cost estimates do not include any identifiable import
duties or taxes as goods imported for use by government ministries are not
subject to these taxes. Costs for professional services are based on current
rates being charged by local architectural firms. In line with recent
experience, the estimate of TA costs is based upon average costs per man-month
of about US$11,000 and US$6,000 equivalent for expatriate and local
specialist's services, respectively (consisting of salary, fees, overhead and



- 16 -
international travel and subsistence) and about US$3,500 for fellowships,
inclusive of international travel. Baseline cost estimates have been adjusted
to reflect prices at negotiations (March 1983).
3.04     Contingency Allowance.  The project cost includes a contingency
allowance for unforeseen physical conditions equal to 10% of the estimated
cost of civil works, furniture and equipment, and professional services and 5%
of the estimated cost of TA. The project cost also includes price escalation
contingencies calculated for the period beginning at negotiations and in
accordance with an appropriate schedule of implementation (Annex 1, Schedule
1). Annual rates of price increase for various categories of expenditure are
indicated in para. 3.01. Prices are expected to increase during the project
implementation period by a total of about 59% for civil works, 57% for
furniture, 37% for equipment, 49% for professional services, and 21% for TA.
Accordingly, aggregated price increases are estimated at about 46.0% of
baseline cost plus physical contingencies. Total contingencies are estimated
to be about 59.9% of the baseline cost.
3.05     Foreign Exchange Component.  The estimated foreign exchange component
is US$42.5 million or about 53.8% of the total project cost. Calculation of
the foreign exchange component is based on the assumption that; (a) all civil
works and related professional services contracts will be awarded to local
firms; (b) all furniture contracts will be awarded to local suppliers; and
(c) all equipment will be directly imported. The resulting foreign exchange
content of each category of expenditure is as follows; (a) civil works, 30%;
(b) furniture, 35%; (c) equipment, 90%; and (d) TA, 80%.

Project Financing
3.06     The proposed loan of US$38.0 million would finance about 89% of the
total estimated foreign exchange cost of the project plus the front-end fee.
The Government would finance the balance of the total project costs. The
proposed financial plan is summarized below:
Government        IBRD
US$M     x      US$M      %     Total
Civil works                     18.9      84     3.5      16      22.4

Total financing required  41.3       52    38.0       48     79.3
Recurrent Expenditure
3.07    When fully operational in 1989/90, the project institutions are
expected to require about LE 3.2 million annually in recurrent costs (in 1980
prices), corresponding to about 34% and 5% of the projected recurrent
expenditure on training for that year by the MDHLR and MOIMR, respectively.
In view of the high priority given to the proposed project, the Government can
be expected to meet these expenditures (para. 1.18).
Implementation
3.08    The construction, furnishing and equipping of all institutions is
expected to be completed by March 31, 1990, while the TA component would be
completed by December 31, 1986 (Annex 1, Schedules I and 2). To alLow
sufficient time for submission of the final withdrawal applications, the
Closing Date would be September 30, 1990.

3.09    Administration.  The existing project implementation teams in the
MDHLR (TOMOHAR) and MOIMR (PVTD) which are currently implementing the second
and third education projects would be responsible for implementing their
respective components in the proposed project. Both teams have performed
effectively during implementation of the previous projects and no additional
implementation staff is required. However, in view of the rapidly expanding
scope of TOMOHAR vocational training activities, the staff of the new TOMOHAR
headquarters at Tenth of Ramadan City will need to be increased by at least
three new full-time posts by June 30, 1984, including a coordinator of
curriculum development, an instructor training supervisor, and a data system
supervisor, all with adequate qualifications and experience, and the
Government provided assurances to this effect during negotiations.
3.10    Architectural Services.  A prototype design for MDHLR's construction
trades VTCs has been developed under previous education projects and will be
adapted by TOMOHAR staff for use in this project. Designs and tender
documents for the MOIMR VTC at Assiut are already under preparation by a
consultant architect/engineer and additional consultant architects/engineers
will be appointed to prepare designs and tender documents for the remaining
MOIMR institutions. Preliminary designs for MOIMR institutions, including the
ITI, were presented to the Bank for review and approval at negotiations and
are satisfactory.
3.11    Sites.  All MDHLR construction trades VTCs are to be located on sites
already owned by the district Governorates. Twelve sites have been turned
over to TOMOHAR for this purpose and TOMOHAR expects that the remaining 10
will be turned over to them by the time of Board presentation. Previous
project experience with TOMOHAR indicates that site acquisition is not likely
to be a problem. The site for the new MOIMR VTC at Sohag has been turned over
to the PVTD by the district Governorate. Existing MOIMR institutions which
are to be extended have sufficient land to allow for their expansion.
3.12    Furniture and Equipment Lists.  Preliminary furniture and equipment
lists for both Ministries were presented to the Bank for review and approval
at negotiations and are satisfactory.
3.13    Technical Assistance.  Draft job descriptions for the specialists and
draft outlines for the fellowship program were discussed and agreed during
negotiations. Before December 31, 1983, qualified training agencies abroad
would be contracted to provide both the required specialists and fellowship
training within the proposed TA program and the TA would be carried out
substantially as scheduled in Annex 1, Schedule 2. Assurances to this effect
were provided by the Government during negotiations.
3.14    Procurement.  In view of the widely dispersed nature of the works and
the relatively small cost of individual items financed under the loan
(averaging US$1.6 million including contingencies), all civil works contracts
for the MDHLR items (amounting to US$34.3 million including contingencies)
would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding under normal
government procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank and do not exclude
foreign bidders. The local construction industry is well-developed and
competitive, and it is expected that all contracts would be awarded to local
firms. As the furniture manufacturing industry is also well developed and
competitive, it is expected



- 19 -
that 100% of furniture contracts would be awarded to local suppliers.
Furniture and equipment items (amounting to about US$33.4 million including
contingencies) would be grouped to the extent possible in large packages to
permit bulk procurement. Contracts for furniture and equipment in excess of
US$100,000 would be awarded in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for
international competitive bidding (ICB). Small items or groups of items
estimated to cost less than the above figure, items of a specialized nature
for which ICB would not be practical, or items which must be compatible with
other equipment procured under ICB would be procured under normal government
procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank and would include, to the extent
possible, quotations from at least three manufacturers or suppliers; the total
value of furniture and equipment so procured would not exceed US$3.0 million
equivalent which would represent about 9% of the estimated furniture and
equipment costs including contingencies. For the purpose of comparing foreign
and local bids under ICB, local manufacturers of furniture and equipment would
be allowed a margin of preference equal to the existing rate of customs duties
applicable to competing imports or 15% of the CIF price, whichever is lower.
Draft tender and contract documents for furniture/equipment and civil works
would, on completion, be forwarded for Bank review and approval; Bank approval
of tender evaluation documents would be required prior to the award of all
contracts for furniture and equipment under ICB and for all civil works
contracts financed under the loan. Bank reimbursement for all other contracts
would be contingent upon Bank approval of tender evaluation documents
subsequent to contract awards. TA and other consultancy services financed by
the Loan would be obtained in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the
use of consultants (August 1981).
Disbursements
3.15    Disbursements (Annex 1, Schedule 3) would be on the basis of:
(a) civil works: 12% of total expenditures;
(b) furniture and equipment; 100% of the foreign cost of directly
imported items and 100% of ex-factory costs of locally manufactured
goods procured through ICB; 80% of costs of goods procured through
local shopping or local bidding; and
(c) TA: 100% of foreign expenditures for fellowships; 100% of total
expenditures for experts.
3.16    Disbursements from the Loan would be fully documented and are
estimated to take place six months after the incurring of the expenditures,
and the Estimated Schedule of Disbursements (Annex 1, Schedule 3) has been
calculated on this basis. Implementation schedules have been drawn up on the
basis of the periods required for the implementation of the three previous
education projects. In a comparison with the country-wide disbursement
profile for Egypt, the end of the implementation period falls at the point
where about 98% of the average loan/credit has been disbursed. The 7-1/2-year
disbursement period is about average for Bank education projects in the EMENA
region.

Accounts and Audits
3.17    Both TOMOHAR and the PVTD maintain separate project accounts for
Bank-financed projects and will do so for the proposed project. Accounts for
the previous education projects at both Ministries have been kept in an
orderly, systematic fashion and recommendations for awards, copies of
contracts and withdrawal applications have been submitted to the Bank in a
-imely and complete manner. It is expected that these methods will continue
under the proposed project. No additional accounting personnel is necessary.
3.18    Project accounts would be audited annually by the Central Accounting
Agency in Egypt and the audited accounts submitted to the Bank within six
months of the end of each fiscal year. The Government provided assurances to
this effect during negotiations.
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01    The proposed project would make a valuable contribution towards
meeting the critical skill shortages which constrain Egypt's efforts to
achieve substantial economic growth by increasing the supply and upgrading the
quality of skilled manpower in the key industrial and construction sectors.
The new VTCs would provide badly needed skill training opportunities for
low-income groups and would reduce regional inequalities in the availability
of vocational training opportunities through the dispersed location of the
training centers among various outlying Governorates. The provision of
boarding facilities for about 50% of the trainees at the ITI in Cairo would
also increase the vocational training opportunities for students from remote
areas.
4.02    An important aspect of the proposed project would be the strengthening
of the Government's planning capability for vocational training and for the
management and evaluation capacity of both Ministries.
4.03    The new and updated training materials developed under the proposed
project would be utilized in all 65 MDHLR. and all 37 MOIMR VTCs. Furthermore,
the project would capacitate the MDHLR to develop and produce its own training
materials.
4.04    The major quantifiable benefits of the proposed project, when fully
operational, would be an annual output of:  (a) about 18,000 workers for 10
construction trades; (b) about 200 industrial trade instructors; and (c) about
730 skilled industrial workers.
Risks
4.05    In view of the satisfactory implementation of previous similar project
components by the project implementation units in the MDHLR and MOIMR, no
undue risks are anticipated with the proposed project. As the TA component is
large (para. 2.03), efficient management will be required to ensure timely
recruitment of specialists and placement of fellows in appropriate training



- 21 -
institutions abroad. Therefore, the Government will again use the training
agency contract method so successfully used under the first, second and third
education projects and an above average amount of supervision by Bank staff
will be provided during the start-up phase (FY84) to further reduce the low
level of risk associated with this project.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01    During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:
(a) the instructor training course for MDHLR will be expanded and its
duration increased to six months by June 30, 1986 (para. 2.06);
(b) the staff of the new TOMOHAR headquarters at Tenth of Ramadan City
will be increased by at least three new full-time posts by June 30,
1984 (para. 3.09);
(c) by December 31, 1983, qualified training institutions abroad will be
contracted to provide both the required specialists and fellowship
training within the proposed TA program and the TA will be carried out
substantially as scheduled in Annex 1, Schedule 2 (para. 3.13); and
(d) project accounts would be audited annually by the Central Accounting
Agency in Egypt and the audited accounts submitted to the Bank within
six months of the end of each fiscal year (para. 3.18).
5.02    Subject to the above conditions, the project provides a suitable basis
for a Bank loan of US$38.0 million equivalent to the Arab Republic ot Egypt
for a term of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years.

Co-parutl- Ed-tcation Data arc useful in the evaluation of various education systems and analysis of relative stages of educational development between various
countries.  However, on the basis of the present data, cross-national  -npariso. should be appr-ached with great caution.  Data preseited in the above table have
seco cnll-cted largely by Bank missions from government sources; the remainder are staff estimates or data from Unesco. Effort. have been made to standardize
befInitinon  and, within lioit., ta chenk the annurany of the data.  Nevertheless, such data are still imperfeot in several respects and the Rank is working to
cprroe then progressively on the occasion of its operational work. In the use of these data, the following qualificatioss should be kept iO mind:
(1)  "Eduation" as defined in the table includes all education and training, both formal and non-fsrnal.
(2) 'Frnary" education refers to education at the first level and "secondary" education refers to sll education at the secondary level regardless of type
(e.g., geoeral, techoical, agricultural).
(3)   Literacy rates" (co. 6) are often obtained frne coantry censuses.  Io many coo-tries they are only appromimatioss and it is doubtful that any uniform
definition of "literate" has been followed consistently.
(4) "Publin expenditore in education" (cols. 4 and 5) refers to all capital and recurrent expenditures devoted to education by public and qoasi-public
agencien..
(5)  "Enrolnent ratio" (coln. 7, 12 and 14) refer to school year and are the percentage of eligible children enrolled fall-time in the appropriate school,
public and privaec by level. They are often nubject to a wide nargin of error in the developing cnuntries owing to variations is the accuracy of basic
data (i.e., age-spenific population and enrolinents). Enrollse.t figures frequently are higher than the unhber of students actually in school. Over-aged
students whose inclusion is indicated by footnotes also can inflate the ratios.
