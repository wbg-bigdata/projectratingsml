APPRAISAL OF THE
MEDIUM CITIES WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project which initiates a
reform of sector policies in Mexico through the financing of construction
for water supply and sewerage works in eight medium-size cities in Mexico
and a training program with a total cost of US$100.0 million appraised by
Bank staff. A Bank loan of US$40 million is proposed, covering the estimated
foreign exchange cost of the Project including interest during construction.
ii.       There are numerous deficiencies in the sanitation systems in Mexican
cities, many of which stem from the traditional sectoral financial and insti-
tutional practices. The situation has been recognized by the Federal
Government which has enacted a National Water Law to regulate water resources,
but has been facing important problems in its implementation, and requested
and cooperated with an IBRD/WHO sector mission whose draft report has recently
been issued. Separately, work was concluded in July 1975 on a National
Hydraulic Plan in which the Bank played a significant role.
iii.      The Bank objective in making this loan is to initiate some of the
needed changes in sector policies while the Mexican Ministries discuss the
two reports, thus helping in the implementation of the National Water Law.
The principal changes will be in the areas of sector financing, where the loan
provisions would substitute debt financing for the present practice of grant
financing and in institution building by the creation of a Project Appraisal
Unit.
iv.       The Bank loan will be channeled through a Federal Development Bank,
the Banco de Obras y Servicios Publicos (BNOSP). The loan proceeds and the
Federal Government counterpart will be relent to individual water undertakings
through an Investment Fund which will be developed as a major lending mechanism
for the sector. There will be separate subloan agreements with each beneficiary
and guarantee agreements from each of the State Governments concerned. Use
will be made of provisions in the subloan and guarantee agreements to improve
management practices, particularly in specifying the responsibilities of each
institution.
v.        Financial covenants will be used to provide a mechanism for
substantial tariff increases with the objective of making the local
administrations financially viable in the short-run and able to generate
cash for future investment. This is a significant change from the present
situation where revenues barely cover operating expenses.



- ii -
vi.       The executing agent will be the Secretaria de Recursos Hidraulicos
(SRH) which has national responsibilities for urban water supply in towns
with populations of 2,500 or more. SRH will design and supervise the con-
struction of the projects and monitor the supervision of operations. The
projects for the eight cities have been appraised by Bank staff and Bank
consultants.  SRH staff also participated in the appraisal and was trained
by the Bank in an effort to develop its capacity to carry out most future
appraisal work.
vii.      This will be the second Bank loan for water supply in Mexico,
the first being a loan of US$90 million for the Mexico City metropolitan
area--a project in which SRH is the executing agent (through its Comision
de Aguas del Valle de Mexico). During the last two years, the retail price
of water has been tripled as a result of Bank participation in this project
and this encourages the belief that the needed price increases can be made
in urban centers, so that the provision of water supply is made on a finan-
cially self-sustaining basic and the water demand is limited by an apprecia-
tion of the cost of supply.
viii.     The Federal Government of Mexico will guarantee the loan and will
make funds available to the Investment Fund, the initial contribution being
US$60 million equivalent as a counterpart to the Bank loan. The Mexican
Government will place additional sums in the Investment Fund as sector
financing plans are developed and implemented.
ix.       All contracts for the construction work and procurement of materials
will be let in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines. Other than
procurement orders for some pipes, almost all contracts are expected to be
won by Mexican companies.
x.        Providing that the conditions set out in section 9 are met, the
project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$40 million equivalent for a term
of 20 years including a 4-year grace period.



MEXICO
APPRAISAL OF THE
MEDIUM CITIES WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Publicos (BNOSP), a Mexican
Federal Development Bank, has requested a Bank loan to help finance a
US$100.0 million equivalent water supply and sewerage program in 8 medium-
size cities in Mexico. This will be the second Bank loan to Mexico for water
supply, the first being a loan of US$90 million made in 1973 to help finance
bulk supply for the Mexico City metropolitan area which is now under construc-
tion.
1.02      BNOSP will be the Borrower.  Funds for the Project will be relent
through an Investment Fund to the local water and sewerage administrations
in the project cities with guarantees from the Federal and State Governments
under terms acceptable to the Bank.
1.03      This project has evolved from discussions between the Mexican
Secretaria de Recursos Hidraulicos (SRH) and Bank staff initiated during
an IBRD/WHO Sector Study of February 1974 for which a draft report has
recently been issued and is now being studied by various Mexican Ministries.
The sector study emphasizes that urgent attention is needed to improve
sector policies, practices and institutions.
1.04      The principal objectives of the project are to help to begin
reforms in sector policies while discussions are taking place on the wider
institutional issues and, by so doing, to provide useful experience for
future changes along the lines of the National Water Law. These changes
are in themselves of greater long-range significance than the physical
improvements to water supply and sewerage systems in the eight cities
selected. Nevertheless, the project will improve the living conditions of
about one and a quarter million people who, at present, have no water supply
or sewerage services, as well as contributing to health and environmental
improvement. The major sector goals to be attained are:
(i) changing the present pattern of financing new works largely
by grants to sound loan financing through the discipline
of a development bank;
(ii) changing a policy of low prices for water services to one
in which tariffs will cover operating costs, debt service
and generate income for future investment;



- 2 -
(iii)  improving the capacity of SRH to undertake project appraisal
to ensure that all sanitation development schemes meet least
cost concepts and make the best use of money available; and
(iv) specifying the responsibilities of various institutions
involved at central and local levels and so assist in the
long-term reform of those whose functions overlap.
1.05      The report is based on the appraisal mission of June 1975 composed
of Messrs. A. Zavala, R. Costa, C. Fernandez, E. Pogson of the Bank and
G. Yepes, a consultant.
II. THE SECTOR
2.01      The water supply and sewerage sector of Mexico has been studied
and reported on in an IBRD/WHO sector study recently published in draft
form. In many of the more populated parts of Mexico water scarcities and/or
conflicts among users are reaching a degree of severity that will increasingly
constrain economic and social development. The principal features of the sector
are:
Service Levels
2.02      Service levels compare favorably with other Latin American
countries but are still less than desirable; of the total urban population
of about 36 million, 70% (25 million) are served with water (house connections)
and 40% (14 million) by sewerage. Of the total of about 21 million rural popu-
lation, about 20% (4 million) are estimated to be served through public systems
mostly in the form of standpipes. Only 3% (0.6 million) have any sewer facilities,
and these are mainly latrines. The situation could deteriorate rapidly because
of high population growth in Mexico (3.5% average for the country as a whole;
5 to 6Z in urban areas).
Institutional Aspects
2.03      By the National Water Law (1972), the SRH is responsible for all
hydraulic activities in Mexico and in particular planning, project pre-
paration and construction of water supply and sewerage systems in communities
having over 2,500 inhabitants. However, SRH has been facing real difficulties
in the Water Law implementation. At present, SRH is only active in about
500-600 out of a total of 2,179 localities, covering only about 20% of the
total urban population. Consequently, information covering the entire sector
is very difficult to obtain. In a similar way, the Ministry of Health,
which is responsible for rural water supply (i.e. for communities with
populations below 2,500), is not covering the entire subsector. Both state
government and municipal authorities control operations and make investments.



- 3 -
An additional source of funds for the sector is the Banco Nacional de Obras
y Servicios Publicos (BNOSP). BNOSP lends for water supply and sewerage
projects, and imposes a stricter financial regime on the localities than do
SRH and the Ministry of Health.
2.04      There is no overall sector policy in Mexico.  A National Hydraulic
Plan (PNH) has recently been completed. This UNDP financed project, for
which the Bank was the executing agency, is under SRH. This study along
with the IBRD Sector Study is under review by the Mexican authorities with
the Bank participating in these discussions. Both reports recommend sector
targets and objectives. In order to facilitate implementation of the recom-
mendations contained in these studies, assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations that SRH will complete an inventory of all water supply and sewerage
systems in Mexico urban communities with more than 2,500 inhabitants within
3 years of loan signature.
Financial and Managerial Aspects
2.05      In general, the financial and managerial aspects are unsatisfactory,
with the exception of a few well managed local administrations. The
fragmented structure of the institutions as well as the over-centralization
of SRH in Mexico City have led to weak managements. Because of the belief
that water is a social good, tariffs are increased infrequently--usually
only when new capital expenditure is envisaged. Since new capital works are,
in effect, grant financed, existing tariffs are far below their economic
level.  This is particularly critical in Mexico where mounting water shortages
related to unbalanced urban and regional growth are rapidly increasing the
cost of water.
2.06      Substantial progress has been made in the past to increase service
levels both in urban and rural areas.  However, the Santiago goals l/ appear
unattainable by 1980. SRH estimates that the investment necessary solely
to keep the percentage of the population served from declining would amount
to over 6 billion pesos (in 1975 prices) over the 1976-1980 period (125
million dollars/year) with more than 80% being allocated to the larger cities.
This is a substantial amount given the present keen competition for public
funds in Mexico. In the 1971-75 period about Mexican 8.8 billion pesos
(141 million dollars/year) (in current prices) were invested in the sector.
The sector study estimates that more than 15 billion pesos (about 1.25 billion
dollars) (in 1975 prices) would be needed in the 1976-1980 period in the
urban sector to achieve the Santiago goals. Such a program is feasible only
if average sector revenues are increased substantially (at least 50% in
real terms) so as to be sufficient to cover operating and capital costs.
1/   The following targets were agreed upon by all Ministries of Health in
Santiago in October 1971: to serve 80% of the urban population and
50% of the rural with water and 50% of the urban population and 30%
of the rural population with sewerage or latrines by 1980.

Sector Objectives to be Achieved through the Project
2.07      The proposed project will facilitate introduction of new policies
into the sector along the lines of the National Water Law. These changes
will include:
(i) A departure from past methods of investment financing--
(effectively grant financing) by introducing loan financing
supported by a policy of adequate internal cash generation;
(ii)  Increases in tariff levels to ensure that the revenues pay
for operation and maintenance and debt service payments;
(iii)  Definition of responsibilities at central and local levels
to facilitate major institutional reforms.
III. THE BORROWER
BNOSP Organization
3.01      The Borrower will be the Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios
Publicos SA of Mexico (BNOSP). BNOSP, founded in 1933, is a wholly owned
Government institution with a paid up capital at December 31, 1974 of
Mex$1,000 million (US$80 million). BNOSP is a development bank specializing
in public and social works (sanitation, urban development, market places,
housing and transportation). It provides loans to federal, state and
municipal governments and agencies, and obtains its funds from the Mexican
and international markets (bond issues and bank lines of credit). BNOSP
is also a financial agent of the Federal Government (Ministry of Finance),
and as such operates various earmarked funds. BNOSP is a well-run entity.
It realized a net profit of US$11 million in 1974, i.e., a return of 4%
on its total assets. It has a tight control over all its financial operations
which are guaranteed by Federal or State taxes. BNOSP either evaluates
and supervises the execution of projects it finances or relies on other
executive agencies whenever they exist (e.g., SRH). This will be the first
occasion BNOSP has acted as a Bank borrower. The Bank loan will be handled
by the Economic Development Department (see organization chart - Chart
15111). BNOSP is legally empowered to act as a Bank borrower.
Revolving Investment Fund
3.02      The intention of the Mexican authorities is to progressively
eliminate Federal budgetary allocation for the sector.  As a first and
essential step towards this objective, an Investment Fund has been estab-
lished. The fund has been placed, as a trust fund, under BNOSP. During
negotiations the Mexican Government provided the Bank with a copy of the
structure, management, scope and financing of the proposed fund. These



-5-
arrangements are satisfactory. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the accounts of the Investment Fund will be subject to an annual audit
by qualified independent auditors. The fund will begin operation by lending
for the sub-projects selected for the proposed loan. The fund will receive
about US$100 million; US$60 million from the Federal Government on an equity
basis and US$40 million from the proposed Bank loan on a reimbursement basis.
The Government will bear the risk of any exchange rate variations.
Operation of the Loan
3.03      BNOSP will not itself evaluate or supervise the execution of
projects (which will be done by SRH). It would act with respect to this
loan as a financial agent of the Federal Government and as such will
present disbursement requests to the Bank and will repay debt service to
the Bank. Payments to contractors and suppliers for work done, as certified
by SRH, will be made by the fund which will also be responsible for the
collection of timely payments of debt service from the beneficiaries.
Subproject Loan Agreements
3.04      The Investment Fund will relend to the beneficiaries, who will
be the local water and sewerage administrations (Juntas) in each subproject
city (Chapter 5 describes the Juntas). Each loan will be secured by a
contractual agreement between the Investment Fund and (a) SRH; (b) the
Government of the State; (c) the Junta, and in certain cases, (d) the
municipal authority. The State Government will guarantee every loan for a
Junta (or municipal body) in its state and will give the Investment Fund a
lien on the state's share of federal taxes. Should a beneficiary fall
behind with debt repayments, the National Treasury could deduct the amount
overdue from its monthly distribution of Federal Taxes to that State. This
method is a standard practice and is acceptable to the Bank.
Obligations of the Parties
3.05      Each agreement will contain certain common conditions including
conditions of effectiveness and each Junta would have to comply with
specific conditions. SRH, acting through the Project Unit (see paras. 4.04
to 4.08) would be responsible for construction and procurement as well as
the supervision of technical and administrative functions during and after
construction. The function of SRH is described in more detail in Chapter 4.
During negotiations BNOSP provided the Bank with a draft of subloan agreements.
It was agreed that Bank approval of every subloan agreement will be a condition
of Bank disbursement for the corresponding subproject. All subloans will be
made in accordance with the policies and procedures outlined below (see
paras. 5.03, 5.04, 5.05, 6.03 and 6.12).
3.06      The Junta will be the beneficiary of the subloans and will be
responsible for debt service repayments and for the discharge of certain
management obligations: for example, reducing amount of outstanding billings.



-6-
3.07      The Municipal Anthority will in certain cases be a signatory
when the Junta has no authority for certain responsibilities such as making
timely increases on charges to new customers for connections.
Terms for Onlending
3.09      The Investment Fund loans to the beneficiaries are assumed to
have a term of about 18 years, including a period of grace equal to the
construction period of the subprojects, usually 3 to 4 years, and to carry
interest rates at 9% on the total loan. Although 9% is lower than the cost
of capital in Mexico, and negative at current rates of inflation, this is
justified as the first and major step away from Government grant financing.
Long-term objectives of the Government on this matter will be discussed with
the Mexicans on the basis of the recommendations made in the sector study
report (see para. 2.04). There will be a small spread between the terms of
funds received by the Investment Fund and the terms at which it relends,
i.e., a shorter amortization period. The shorter repayment period has been
selected to more rapidly generate the funds required in the sector, and to
cover the Investment Fund administrative costs.
3.10      Until now, Federal investments have been made as loans from budgetary
allocations, but the Juntas have been required to repay the loan with the
surplus cash, if any, remaining at the year-end after meeting operating costs.
Frequently, the whole outstanding debt has been forgiven after some time.
The operation of the Investment Fund will bring a financial discipline to the
Juntas through the project loan agreements. The subloan mechanism discussed
above offers a satisfactory arrangement.
IV. THE EXECUTING AGENT
The Ministry of Hydraulic Resources
4.01      The Mexican Ministry of Hydraulic Resources (SRH) will be the
executing agency for the proposed loan. The Ministry has principal legal
responsibility for water resources in the country (see para. 2.03), although
other ministries operate in the sector. Chart 7164 (2B), showing the main
structure of SRH, illustrates the division of activity into four sub-Secre-
tariats, viz. (1) Planning, (2) Construction, (3) Operation, (4) Support
Services.  SRH has offices in the States which are controlled by the SRH
State General Managers who report directly to the Secretary independently
of both the operation and construction sub-Secretariats.
4.02      The strengths of SRH as an executing agency are in the separation
of responsibility for water and sewerage projects from other hydraulic
activities and in the competence of its engineering staff in design and
construction. The weakness lies in the separation of construction and



- 7 -
operation activities, the centralization of control activities of these
departments in Mexico City, and the lack of training in project analysis.
Chart 15109 shows the activities of the Director General of Water Supply
and Sewerage, is in the Construction Subsecretariat. Chart 15110 shows
the Operation Subsecretariat. For water supply and sewerage operations,
the quality of supervision is good for construction work but poor for
operation. The existence of a "General Manager" in the States diffuses
responsibility further because of poor liaison between the departments in
Mexico City and those in the State.
4.03      During the last 18 months, a number of proposals for ins-titutional
reform have been under discussion within SRH with the dual aims of clarifying
management lines of responsibility and providing a measure of decentralized
operation. These proposals include:
(1) Unifying the field offices of the Construction Subsecretariat
and State General Managers, and
(2) Forming a Water and Sewerage entity (possibly a national Water
Commission) separate from the other activities of SRH.
It is not thought appropriate that the proposed loan agreement should contain
requirements for sector institutional reorganization because the draft sector
report has been issued so recently, and the government is in the process of
reviewing possible alternative institutional arrangements.
Project Unit
4.04      In August 1974, a special unit (DCE) was formed in the office of
the Director General of Water Supply and Sewerage. It was intended to
operate as the project unit, particularly to prepare feasibility studies
for Bank review during appraisal of the project. It did not function
properly because of lack of competent staff and lack of coordination of the
Departments involved.   Moreover, the unit was not given authority for the
supervision of operational activities.
4.05      During appraisal, the Bank stressed to the Mexican authorities that
the creation of an adequate Project Unit would be a condition of the loan.
Since then SRH has established such a unit (Gerencia de Proyectos Especiales
de Agua Potable y Alcantarillados). It reports, in an advisory capacity,
directly to the Minister. The unit has the necessary authority to monitor
project preparation, appraisal, design, execution and administration of sub-
projects financed with the proposed Bank loan. The organization structure
of the unit, which was discussed during negotiations, is satisfactory (see
Chart 15382). It provides for five departments: Project Evaluation, Super-
vision of Construction, Supervision of Operations, Training and Administration.
A competent engineer, hitherto director of small water supply systems within
SRH, has been appointed as the head of the unit and participated in the nego-
tiations. Unit staffing is underway: already 13 engineers and 7 financial
analysts have been recruited.



- 8 -
4.06      The unit's role is to appraise existing and further feasibility
studies for subprojects prepared by other SRH departments which are being
considered for Bank financing. One of its first tasks will be to draw up
guidelines for the use of SRH engineers in designing subprojects.  It will
monitor the construction of the subprojects and will act as a training ground
for SRH staff.
4.07      The unit will also monitor the subprojects' system operations.  It
will participate in the preparation and implementation of adequate guidelines
for the operation and administration of subprojects and will monitor the
financial performances of the local authorities in correlation with the
Directorate of Operations, BNOSP and the Investment Fund.
4.08      In order to ensure a better efficiency of the unit, the following
assurances were obtained during negotiations from the Federal Government:
(1)  That the unit will be maintained within SRH with its present
responsibilities;
(2)  That, at all times, suitable qualified staff in adequate numbers
will be assigned to the unit;
(3)  That guidelines for preparation of subproject feasibility
studies and designs would be prepared by SRH within six
months of loan signature and implemented within the following
six months. The Bank will be afforded a reasonable opportunity
to exchange views on these guidelines.
4.09      The creation of a Project Unit is recognized to be only an inter-
mediary solution intended to ensure adequate management of the Project within
a complex and enormous organization. This set-up should, however, be revised
within the context of a possible SRH reorganization (see para. 4.03).
Conclusion
4.10      SRH is competent in the engineering field but its capacity in
management and project appraisal require improvement. With the understanding
that the Project Unit will continue to be provided with qualified staff and
sufficient authority, SRH is suitable as the Executing Agent.
V. THE BENEFICIARIES
Organization
5.01      The beneficiaries will be the water and sewerage 1/ administrations
of the subproject cities (the Juntas). A Junta is established by a state or
1/   For detailed characteristics of Juntas see Annex 1.



- 9-
municipal decree. There are several types of Juntas but these are variations
of three basic types: (1) "Juntas Federales" are administered by SRH and
supervised by staff in the sub-Secretariat of Operation; (2) "Juntas Estatales"
are legally dependent jointly on the respective State Government and the SRH
State organization (General Manager) but in practice tend to be treated as
subsidiaries of the State Government; and (3) "Juntas Municipales" are
dependencies of the local municipal authorities. Other than the composition
of the managing body, the bylaws generally follow a standard pattern. Each
of the Juntas for the project cities has legal personality and could contract
for a loan with BNOSP. 1/
Local Management
5.02      The direction of a Junta is carried out by a number of representative
members-five is the typical number--who are nominated by or elected from
specified bodies, including representatives of SRH, the State Government,
the municipal government and consumers. In general, the Juntas are not well
managed, and there is a diffusion of management authority between the Juntas,
SRH and the State Government. The Juntas in smaller towns frequently do
not employ qualified staff; it is unusual for a Junta to have its own
engineer. This is reflected in the poor standard of maintenance and
particularly the excessive water losses.
Tariffs
5.03      The Juntas do not possess the power to set tariffs.  This right
is held by the elected Congress of the state. In practice, and in the belief
that water is a social good, tariffs have been increased principally, often
solely, as part of an agreement under which SRH provides additional capital
work. In many cities tariffs have not been raised in ten years. In order
to make the Juntas financially self-supporting, the terms of the proposed
loan mechanism are designed to focus attention on the need for timely tariff
increases. Each subproject loan agreement will contain a guarantee by
the State Government to present timely requests to the Congress for tariff
increases to meet the financial covenants (see para. 8.04).
Administration
5.04      The Juntas maintain cash accounting records, and, in general, have
deficient billing and collecting procedures. Other weaknesses, such as poor
organization, lack of qualified engineers and accountants, etc., have been
identified in each individual city. The proposed training program described
in para. 6.05 will be directed to improve personnel qualifications, and
specific proposals for improvement of administration (including monitoring
indicators) will be contained in the subproject loan agreements.
1/   For detailed characteristics of Juntas see Annex 1.



- 10 -
5.05      The accounts of all the Juntas are subject to audit by the staff
of audit departments of either SRH, the State Government or the Municipal
Authority. Actual practices vary, but in some Juntas audits have not been
made for several years. The subproject loan agreements will require an
annual audit, and where one is overdue an audit prior to disbursement of the
loan. The Mexican authorities agreed during negotiations that the audits
will be carried out by qualified and experienced auditors independent from
the Beneficiaries appointed by SRH (with terms of reference acceptable to
the Bank).
Other Water Suppliers
5.06      In some cities, water is produced and distributed by other
organizations--particularly the State-owned petroleum company PEMEX and
the Federal Power Authority, CFE. TheIprincipal use of water is for industrial
purposes, but the companies also supply water free of charge to employees who
reside in company houses. While the Federal Water Law permits the SRH both
to license any private use and to charge for the license, this has not been
done with any consistency. SRH proposes to negotiate terms with the companies
for the takeover of their systems by the Juntas. The Federal Government has
agreed during negotiations to use its best efforts to reach such an arrangement.
VI. THE PROJECT
Scope of the Project
6.01      The project will cover eight subprojects, each designed to improve
or extend water supply (and in six cases sewer systems) in eight medium-size
cities in Mexico with a training program for SRH and the Beneficiaries' staff.
Project Preparation
6.02      Detailed evaluation reports for the subprojects were prepared by
DCE with considerable assistance from Bank staff and consultants (see para.
4.04). The location of the cities is shown on the enclosed map.
Existing Facilities
6.03      Details of the existing facilities are given in Annex 2.  The eight
cities have a total population of 1.5 million in 1975. Service levels and
incremental population served by the Project are shown in the following Table:

Unaccounted-for water averages 42%, and may be higher since reliable
statistics on revenue from non-metered water connections are not available.
Causes include water leakage in old pipes of the distribution system, poor
maintenance, damaged house connections, free water distribution to official
institutions and lack of water meters. In total, about 29% of house con-
nections do not have water meters. It was agreed during negotiations that
annual targets showing the reduction of unaccounted-for water will be incor-
porated in the subsidiary loan agreements between the Investment Fund and the
local authorities.
Construction
6.04      A detailed description of the proposed works in each of the eight
subprojects is given in Annex 3. Features common to all projects include
the extension of water service to new users, the installation of meters on
unmetered sources, repair of meters and a leak detection and repair
program.  About 39,000 water meters will be installed during the con-
struction period, and the total to be ordered is around 75,000. SRH will
have the benefit of bulk purchasing. About 44,000 new sewerage discharges
will be installed.



- 12 -
Training Program
6.05      The training proposed, while essentially for the benefit of
people associated with this project, will also be used to develop a nation-
wide training plan. The proposed loan would finance 40% of the training
cost, including the correlated studies.
The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) has been assisting
SRH with training and has developed a number of programs for both operational
and administrative staff which will be the basis of the training for SRH
and Junta staff associated with this project. As far as possible, training
will be held at local or regional centers, and a good proportion of the
operator training will be within the Junta. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations on the terms of the SRH training program for the subproject
cities. This training will help SRH to prepare, on a limited scale, a
nationwide training program and to submit this for Bank approval before
December 31, 1977.
Cost Estimates
6.06      The total investment for the Project is estimated to be around
US$90 million as shown on page 13. Interest during construction on Bank
and local funds amounts to US$10 million. An analysis of the construction
cost for the eight cities is given in Annex 4.
The estimates are based on prices of January 1975, using the
Unit Prices Catalogue-1975 prepared yearly by the Sub-Secretariat for
Construction of SRH. The Bank reviewed the Catalogue and found it sound,
and unit prices justified.
The direct and indirect foreign exchange component would be about
26% of the construction cost if locally manufactured asbestos pipe were
used exclusively. However, experience suggests that pipe will have to be
imported since the local manufactures do not have capacity to meet all demands.
Thus Mexico can be regarded as a net pipe importer, and on this basis the
total foreign component has been estimated as 40% of project cost.
Physical contingencies amount to 15% of the estimated project
construction costs, reflecting potential additional costs which may arise
during detailed design and construction of some of the project components.
Engineering and administration costs have been estimated at 10% of the
construction costs.
6.07      The exchange rate has been stable in Mexico for many years at
Mex$12.50 for 1 US dollar. Increases in prices due to inflation have been
calculated using the Mexican Retail Price Index for civil works, namely 17%,
15% and 12% for the years 1975, 1976 and 1977 respectively; and 10% thereafter.
For imported equipment, inflation has been estimated on the basis of construc-
tion cost indices for the United States. The resulting inflation rates for
equipment are 14% in 1975, 12% in 1976 and 10% in 1977. It is expected that
most of the imported equipment will originate from the United States.

6.08      Assurances were obtained from the Government during negotiations
that the Investment Fund will promptly provide or be provided with the
necessary additional funds to meet cost overruns.
Procurement
6.09      Contracts for civil works and equipment and materials would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank guidelines for procurement. Mexico has a well developed and
competent contracting industry, capable of doing all types of civil works
at competitive prices, and only rarely is a bid submitted from a non-
Mexican firm. However, in order to facilitate the participation of inter-
national contractors, civil works would, insofar as possible, be grouped
into contracts having a minimum value of Mex$20 million (US$1.6 million).
For contracts in lesser amounts, local bidding procedures which are acceptable
to the Bank will be followed. Similarly, equipment and materials of less
than Mex$1.875 million (US$150,000) would be procured under local bidding
procedures. Since the project will have to be executed in eight different
cities, it was agreed during negotiations that procurement procedures should
leave some flexibility for force account and restricted bidding procedures
for small works, as shown below:

The Project Unit through its Department of Supervision of Construction (see
para. 4.05) will control procurement and act as liaison agent with the Bank
in procurement matters.



- 15 -
6.10      At present none of the equipment to be procured is subject to
preference under the Latin American Free Trade Agreement (LAFTA), but
Mlexican suppliers of equipment and materials will be eligible for preference
equal to the amount of customs duties and other import taxes which a non-
exempt importer would have to pay for the importation subject to a ceiling
of 15%. It is expected that all of the civil works contracts and most of
the equipment supply contracts (with the exception of specialized treatment
plant equipment) will be won by local firms.
Project Execution and Supervision
6.11      The project will be executed in four years, 1976 through 1979.  Due
to the significant investments included in the project for water treatment,
it was agreed during negotiations that no withdrawal shall be made from the
loan amount in respect of works to increase the water supply systems of
Mexicali, Tampico-Ciudad Madero and Morelia until the Bank shall have been
furnished a satisfactory optimization study to increase the capacity of the
existing treatment plants in these cities.
6.12       A construction schedule of each city included in the project is
contained in the feasibility studies. Detailed designs, bidding and con-
tract documents preparation, and construction supervision will be the
responsibility of SRH. The project is expected to require extensive Bank
supervision, on the order of 30 manweeks, in 1976 and 1977. During negotia-
tions it was agreed that a project implementation schedule will be prepared
for each city and included in the corresponding subloan agreement. A project
implementation schedule is shown in Chart No. 15159.
Disbursement
6.13      The loan will be disbursed for the foreign exchange cost equivalent
of 40% of civil works, equipments and materials locally procured. The loan
will also be disbursed against 40% of expenditures for the training program.
It will also cover interest during construction on the part of the project to
be financed by the Bank. A disbursement schedule is given as Annex 5.
Environmental Aspects
6.14      The project will increase the water supply in the cities concerned
by improving service, and consequently, environmental conditions; this impact
is maximized by the fact that population to be served belong to the lower
income group. As a result of the project, sewerage services provided to
poor areas of the cities in question will be an important factor in control-
ling diseases caused by land excreta disposal and improving environmental
aesthetic aspects. Water pollution abatement will be particularly important
in the estuaries of the Panuco River in Tampico, the Bravo River in Reynosa
and the Nuevo River in Mexicali.



- 16 -
Technical Studies
6.15      It was agreed during negotiations that during the course of project
execution, studies for water pollution control and a national water metering
study will be conducted by SRH. The water pollution control surveys will
consist of detailed feasibility studies of projects to be carried out in areas
to be determined by the Government on agreement with the Bank. The water meter-
ing study will be carried out on all the systems operated by SRH. The Bank
will be afforded a reasonable opportunity to exchange views on the terms of
reference and conclusions of such studies.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Objectives of the Project
7.01      A major objective of the project is to help establish and implement
policies for the national water supply and sewerage sector. This is to be
attained in two ways. First, the establishment of sound investment financing
policies by means of the Investment Fund, acting as an agent of Federal Govern-
ment to raise and reallocate funds for the sector. Second, the improvement
of the institutional structure in the water sector, both in the undertakings
in the subproject cities and SRH in its capacity as a central review body for
project evaluation. These institutional reforms are intended as a first step
in a movement to better the planning policies and procedures at the center,
and in the cities to make better use of available financial resources by
introducing realistic tariff policies.
7.02      The Investment Fund (which is discussed in Chapter 3), will begin
operations by lending for the subprojects of this loan. It is intended to
become one of the main sources of sector finance and in this way will be an
agent of sector reform in bringing the discipline of efficient lending prac-
tices to the sector.
7.03      The objective to be attained is that each Junta of a Bank-financed
subproject should be financially self-supporting for its water supply and
sewerage activities. It is a fundamental step away from traditional policies
of grant financing. The institution of frequent reviews of tariff levels
will by itself be of great significance in changing the sector policies,
and the use of a sector Revolving Fund as the source of sector finance will
help establish sound lending policies.
7.04      By the use of loan covenants which will specify the respective
obligations of (1) the Juntas, (2) SRH (central and local offices) and the
(3) State and municipal Governments, the execution and supervision of this
project will help establish clear guidelines on authority and responsibility
where, at present, there is uncertainty. Improved management practices



- 17 -
will be implemented by means of the training program; the efficiency of
operation will be improved--particularly maintenance. The establishment
of project guidelines and the review activity of the Project Unit should
check the present tendency to overdesign systems and so permit finance to
be used economically and serve a larger number of people.
It is clearly recognized that even if these objectives were
fully attained, the extent of improvement in overall sector policies would
be small but not insignificant. The experience gained will be valuable
in the implementation of desirable and fundamental institutional changes
in SRH (see Chapter 4).
Project Selection and Demand
7.05      The selection of subprojects was made after consideration of a
number of factors including the application of least-cost concepts and the
desire to expand services in medium-size towns as one of the many measures
needed to check exceptional growth in large cities.
In most of the cities the new consumers will be predominantly of
the low-income groups who have often settled in sub-standard accommodation
on the edges of the cities. In 1975 service levels among the 40% urban
poor in the cities varied between 0% and 50%. After 1982 when these projects
are completed the corresponding levels are expected to be from 50% to 90%.
Tariff structures are to be created, designed to charge for water-and sewerage
services with regard to the ability to pay.
Choice of the sewerage components of the project was made after
examination of demand as shown by existing service levels (24% to 69%)
of total population, and by establishing the least-cost solution to enhance
these levels to between 60% and 80% by 1982.
Average 3montly consumption of water per connection (which ranged
in 1974 from 25 m per month to 48) is expected to fall because of the
combined effects of higher tariffs and the addition of low-income consumers,
and this is reflected in the financial projections.
In several cases the proposed designs were modified to remove
water and sewerage components which were not considered essential or
necessary at this time, and reach least-cost solutions.
Return on Investment
7.06      The incremental financial rate of return on the proposed investments
in water supply ranges from 0.7 to 10.7. '0' has been used as a cut-off rate
for inclusion of projects in the project.



- 18 ,
Benefits have been calculated on 1976 prices and measured by the
incremental net revenue to 2007. The rates of return are lower than those
obtained in other cities outside Mexico for a variety of reasons. Common
causes for these lower rates include the relatively high service levels
(see para. 6.03) which limit the incremental sales, as well as the practical
difficulty of increasing tariffs to theoretically desirable levels.
This position arises because of the policy of subsidizing water
and sewerage supplies. The investments and projections which are now
presented represent a substantial improvement in the position since many
previous investments would have had a negative incremental rate of return.
It is recommended that these projects be accepted in view of the
significant changes in sector policy which could be attained through the
project.
A set of monitoring indicators is given in Annex 6.   Proposed
percentage increases in average water tariffs from the present level are
shown below:

rates because no value has been computed for benefits not reflected in water
revenues to community environment as well as for improvements in living

conditions and general health due to improved water quality and service.
Nor has any calculation been made of the additional public revenue which can
accrue from higher land taxes. Five of the subprojects include works to
improve water quality, and a part of this benefit could be said to accrue
to existing consumption and is thus not reflected in the incremental rate
of return. Because it is difficult to obtain accurate data, no attempt has
been made to quantify these factors.
Project Risk
7.08      There are a number of untested features, such as:
(i)  the ability of the staff of the SRH Project Unit to review
future feasibility studies--this risk is rated less than
moderate and can be overcome by close and frequent Bank
supervision;
(ii) the extent to which the Project Unit can act as an
agent of change in the present institutional situation
in SRH when it will be responsible for less than 10%
of the number of cities where water supply works exist
or are planned--probably an average risk and acceptable,
given the present desire of the authorities to make
changes;
(iii) the willingness of consumers to pay and the willingness
of the various State's Congresses to raise tariffs
frequently and by large amounts. This should be rated
as average to high but acceptable because the problem
arises from the political constraints in raising
tariffs substantially and frequently. It is not due to
the consumers' inability to pay;
(iv) the strength of determination of the Mexican authorities
to initiate financial and organizational reforms on a
nationwide basis (other than Bank projects) is probably an
average risk and acceptable given the present impetus
for change, and the measures already taken.
VIII. FINANCES
8.01      This chapter reviews the past financing policies for the develop-
ment and operation of water supply and sewerage systems in the urban sector
and outlines the changes to be proposed in conjunction with this project.
Annex 7 gives the assumption on which financial projections are made. A
set of Financial Tables is available for each subproject. A set for one
subproject is included for illustration as Annex 8.

Past Finances
8.02      The outstanding characteristics of the financial picture is the
low level of revenues and a laxity in the repayment of capital debts. The
Juntas are supposed to set tariffs at a level sufficient to raise enough
income to meet all operating costs and debt repayment. However, the debt
repayment to the Federal Government is made at the year end if there is
any difference between income and expenditure (not including depreciation).
Tariffs are usually increased only when the local administration
negotiates with SRH for new capital works and at infrequent dates afterwards.
As a consequence, revenues often barely cover operating expenses. The Juntas
maintain cash accounting records; by making adjustments to these records
the financial results for 1974 have been estimated and are shown in Table
4.
This shows a common pattern of inadequate revenues, low debt
service and low financial rates of return.
Financing Plan
8.03      The estimated Financing Plan for the project is as follows:

1,250.0         100.0       100.0
The Financing Plan is based on the following assumptions:
The Investment Fund
(i) IBRD will contribute to the Investment Fund approximately
40% of the cost of each subproject and the training program
up to a total amount of US$40 million. This loan will have
an assumed rate of interest of 8-1/2% and be repaid over 20
years including a four year grace period.



- 22 -
(ii)  The Mexican Government will provide counterpart finance
to the Investment Fund on an equity basis for approximately
60% of the total cost of the subprojects, and the training
program.
Details of the terms of the Federal Government counterpart funds
were reviewed and agreed upon during negotiations.
The Juntas
It was agreed during negotiations that the subloans from the
Investment Fund to the Beneficiaries:
(iii)  Will be made in an amount equivalent to up to 100% of the cost
of construction plus interest during construction;
(iv)  Will carry an interest of 9% and a term of 18 to 19 years
including the grace period (3 to 4 years).
Individual Financing Plans for each subproject are given in Annex 8.
Tariffs
8.04 (a) Agreement was reached during negotiations on the following basis
for setting future tariffs. Each individual subloan agreement will
provide for:
(i) In the first calendar year following the date of the
subloan agreement, tariffs will be increased in order
to cover one-third of the difference between the levels
of the present charges and the levels required in para.
(ii). In the second calendar year, tariffs will be
increased at a level at least equal to the level of
present charges plus two-thirds of such a difference.
(ii)  Effective from the third calendar year after the year
of signature of the subloan agreement, the annual
gross revenues would be at least sufficient to meet
the sum of:
(a) operating expenses;
(b) the total amount of either (1) interest and
debt repayments or (2) the annual depreciation
charge on revalued fixed assets--whichever is the
higher;
(c) changes in working capital and the financing of
minor investments (expressed as 3% of net revalued
fixed assets plus works in progress).



- 23 -
(b)  Tariff Structures
In many of the cities tariff structures are inadequate
since there is no discrimination between types of consumers.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that each
subproject loan agreement will contain a provision for the
implementation of an acceptable tariff structure which
will aim at charging a lower price per cubic meter for
low volume consumers. This will help low-income sectors
of the population to obtain benefits from the project.
(c)  Sewerage Tariffs
In some cities no charge is made for sewerage services.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that charges
for sewerage service would be introduced wherever they do
not exist and estimated in accordance with the specific
recommendations of the feasibility study for each subproject.
Connection Charges
8.05      The local administrations generally eharge connection fees to new
consumers for both water and sewerage service in two parts: a charge for
the right to have water, "connection fee", and a charge for part or all
of the cost of connecting the consumer to the distribution system, "a
coanection charge". Because the Juntas have the right to vary these charges,
they are increased more frequently than tariffs. The total payment required
from a new water consumer might equal 36 months water bills and represents
a significant part of the income of the Juntas.
The experience so far has been that consumers are willing to pay
these connection charges, but it is possible that as water and sewerage
services are extended to lower income consumers the high initial charge
might deter some users. It was agreed during negotiations that the Investment
Fund will also provide for the financing of connection costs in ol4er to help
the Juntas to offer longer payment periods to low income consumers.
Fair Value of Fixed Assets
8.06      The Mexican authorities have calculated assets values on the
records of the Juntas as of December 31, 1972, and revaluation has been
calculated from that date. In some cities the values are thought to be
too low and the inventory incomplete. To enable a calculation to be made
of revalued assets, SRH has been asked to make a revaluation of fixed assets
in use in the subproject undertakings as of July 1975. Agreement was reached
during negotiations that these inventories will be provided prior to any Bank
loan disbursement for each subproject.



- 24 -
Future Finances
8.07      Details of the assumptions made for the financial projections are
given in Annex 7. Annual financial rates of return for the subproject cities
have been calculated on roughly estimated revalued net fixed assets and typi-
cally are between 4% and 6% with extremes of 2.5% and 11%.
8.08      The main financial and associated subproject provisions will provide
each city with a set of financial targets which will direct the local adminis-
tration towards sounder operating practices and good financial management.
The use of the agreed financial covenant should enable the local administration,
in the short-run (1976-1981), to finance minor capital works and, in the long-
run (1982 and thereafter), to make a contribution to major works as soon as
the annual depreciation becomes higher than debt service payments.
IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      The following assurances were obtained during negotiations:
(a)  From the Federal Government:

8.04 and 8.05);
(ii) on the terms and conditions for annual audits of the
Juntas' accounts (para. 5.05).
9.02      The following events would be conditions of disbursement-for the
proposed Bank loan:

Morelia, the Bank shall have been furnished with a
study regarding the increase in capacity of the
existing water treatment plants in these cities (para.
6.11);
(ii) for all cities, the Bank shall have approved each
subloan agreement (para. 3.05);

Medium Size Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project
Existing Water Supply and Sewerage Facilities
1.   CIUDAD VICTORIA
Its water supply sources are groundwater infiltration galleries
and deep wells located in the San Marcos river basin and several deep
wells within the city. The safe yield of the existing San Marcos development
is 222 1/sec and of the city wells 96 1/sec. Water from these sources is
chlorinated and its quality is good.
Water from the San Marcos basin is drawn by pumping and gravity
to a collection box and sent to a distribution tank of 2,000 m3 capacity
through a 75 and a 85 cms diameter 2.0 kms long gravity aqueduct. Water
from the deep wells is pumped directly to the distribution network.
The distribution network includes 126 kms of pipes from 2-1/2'
to 14" and two storage tanks with a total combined capacity of 5,000 m3.
The network is divided into two pressure zones, and is limited in capacity
and coverage. Unaccounted-for water averages 37% of production.
The sewerage systems are separated, and the sanitary network
comprises 114 kms of pipes. The system discharges without treatment
to the San Marcos river and to a creek whose waters are used for irrigation.
The sanitary sewer system is limited in coverage.
The water and sewerage systems are operated by the "Junta Federal
de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de Ciudad Victoria" (Ciudad Victoria
Water and Sewerage Federal Board).

The source of water supply is the Colorado River, diverted by the
Morelos dam to the Mexicali valley irrigation district. Diversion structures
for Mexicali water supply have a design capacity of 3.0 m3/sec. Raw water
is pumped and then treated in two plants; one, with a design capacity of
106,000 m3/day, has conventional treatment of rapid mix, flocculation-
sedimentation, filtration and chlorination; the other plant provides only
sedimentation and chlorination, and satisfies about 25% of total demand.
The distribution system includes 572 kms of pipes from 2" to 54",
three storage tanks with a total combined capacity of 15,900 m3, and two
main pumping stations after the treatment plants with a total capacity of
1950 1/sec. The distribution system is adequate but needs to be expanded
to meet increasing growth. Unaccounted-for water averages 30% of plant
production, water uses for plant operations represent 12% of total pro-
duction.
The city has a sanitary sewer system, and sewage is treated in a
stabilization pond system before it is discharged by pumping to the Rio Nuevo
River. Wastewater is pumped by three pumping stations to the stabilization
ponds. The sewerage system has 377 kms of pipes and provides service to
50% of the population through 22,000 connections.

Lagoon on the Tamesi River estuary by a pumping station which delivers
the water through two (24" - 30") pipelines, 200 mts. long, to the water
treatment plant.
The water treatment plant was designed for 1,150 1/sec flow
when built in 1952, but it has not operated since shortly after its con-
struction. Water plant treatment processes include rapid mixing, flocculation-
sedimentation, filtration, open cationic exchange units, chlorination and
chemical stabilization. Only the chlorination and sedimentation processes
are at present functioning, although rather poorly.
The water distribution system is divided into six pressure zones
(three for each city) and includes 470 kms of pipes 4" to 24" in diameter,
one main pumping station at the water treatment plant as well as two
additional pumping stations within the city, and four storage tanks with
a total capacity of 31,890 m3. The distribution system is limited in capacity
and coverage, and unaccounted-for water averages 50% of water delivered by
the water treatment plant.
There are three private water systems that provide service to
1,880 house connections and several private industrial water supplies, the
most important being PEMEX (1.0 m3/sec), Comision Federal de Electricidad
(1.2 m3/sec) and Petrocel (0.5 m3/sec).

Assumptions for Financial Projections
The financial projections have been made using the ECOFI computer
projection system. For each subproject, there is a data file showing the
basis of all assumptions. The following are the significant assumptions
which apply to all the projections.
Table A lists the main financial tables produced for each set of
projections.
Assumptions Common to all Subprojects
Base Years
The financial statements for years 1973, 1974 and 1975 are best
estimates prepared by SRH. The value placed on fixed assets is almost
certainly too low and will need to be corrected when the asset revaluation
excercise is completed, consequently the assumed accounts of depreciation
are thought to be too low.
Inflation
Internal inflation is measured by the (estimated) Mexican National
Retail Price Index for the interior.  The projections assume rates of:
1975      1976       1977      1978       1979      1980-82
17%       15%       12%        10%        10%        10%
Operating Costs
(a)  The increases in operating costs are based on these figures
and the volume of water produced.
(b)  The estimates of the construction costs of the project have
been increased using the same figure.
(c)  The estimates of the cost of imported materials have been
increased by a price inflation factor equal to the estimated
change in the construction cost index of the USA.
Asset Value
(i) To revalue fixed assets, 85% of the known and expected increases
in consumner prices has been used since this has been found to
approximate the Mexican construction cost index:



ANNEX 7
Page 2
1975      1976       1977       1978      1979-82
14%       12%        10%        8%          8%
(ii) Assets are assused to depreciate at 3% per annum.
Devaluation
The Mexican peso is presumed to maintain its present relationship
of 12.50 to the US dollar.
SuPplies to Govermnent Departments and Educational Bodies
The free supply of water is presumed to end in 1977.
Taxes
The Juntas are exempt from taxes other than social security and
are assumed to remain in that status.
In some cities the State raises a development tax on property owners
in areas to which a new service is to be provided. No account has been taken
of this in the revenues of the Juntas. When such sums are determined, the
value of any of such specific tax will be counted as revenue for the purpose
of calculating the financial cash generation covenant.
Financial Covenant; Tariffs
A projection of likely tariffs has been made on the basis of
the financial covenant (para. 8.03).
Connection Fees and Charges
Income from connection fees has been treated as "other operating
income". Income from connection charges has been treated as "non-
operating income".
