MANILA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT II
I. THE SECTOR
Background
1.01      The Philippines is endowed with abundant water resources.  Not only
does the country have an average annual rainfall of about 300 cm, but it also
has nine major river basins, many lakes and streams, and extensive groundwater
resources sufficient to cover foreseeable needs in most areas of the country.
However, public investment in the water supply sector has traditionally been
very low with the result that the infrastructure for water supply, sewerage,
and drainage is currently inadequate throughout the country.
Population Served and Service Levels
1.02      It is estimated that only about 17.0 million people (38% of the
estimated 1977 population of about 44.5 million) are served by public water
supply systems. Of these 3.2 million are in the Metropolitan Manila Area
(MMA), 3.7 million in other urban areas, and 10.1 million in rural areas.
In MMA, 53% of its 5.8 milion population has access to public water supply
and in other urban areas and in the rural communities about 53% and 32%,
respectively, obtain a relatively safe supply through piped systems, artesian
wells and springs. In Manila and also in other communities with piped water
systems, insufficient investments, growth in demand, advanced age of the
facilities and high leakage rates arising from inadequate maintenance have
reduced water main pressures. Many systems are operated to supply water for
only a few hours a day to avoid loss of water during the off-peak hours.
The remaining 27.5 million (or 62% of the population) manage with water
which is often of doubtful quality from sources such as open wells, handpumps,
rain water cisterns, lakes, rivers, and streams.
1.03      Sewerage and drainage facilities are also in great need of improve-
ment. The most recent National Health Plan (1975-85) cited poor environmental
sanitation as a major factor in the high incidence of communicable diseases
in the country. In Manila, typhoid, cholera and gastroenteritis are endemic;
in 1972 morbidity and mortality from these diseases were about 1,800 and 80,
respectively, per 100,000 population. Most cities rely principally on
individual septic tanks, pits and the direct discharge of untreated wastes
into nearby water courses.
Development of the Water Supply Sector
1.04      The National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NWSA) was created
in 1955 to own and operate all of the water and sewer systems then existing
in the Philippines. Almost from its inception, however, NWSA was plagued by
severe managerial and financial problems. The organization suffered from
weak top management, a lack of staff discipline, financial weakness exacerbated
by low tariffs and inadequate financial planning, and recurring disputes with
contractors and suppliers which often resulted in time-consuming court
proceedings. In 1964, the Bank made a loan of $20.2 million (Loan 386-PH) to
NWSA to expand and improve the water supply system serving the Metropolitan
Manila Area. The problems noted above, however, seriously affected project
implementation. After the closing date for the loan was postponed twice, the



-2-
undisbursed balance of $0.6 million was cancelled in 1970. Most of the
project components were completed in 1972, although some works continued
until 1975.
1.05      During the 1970s, the Government has taken a number of important
steps to improve the organization of the water supply sector. NWSA was
dissolved in 1971 and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS)
was created under a new charter to be primarily responsible for water supply
and sewerage in the MMA./1 Since that time the management of water supply
operations in Metropolitan Manila has improved significantly. The financial
position of MWSS has also been improving steadily. In May 1974, water
tariffs were increased, MWSS' capital was restructured and its past loans
were converted into equity, all of which helped MWSS earn surpluses in FY75
and FY76.
1.06      The creation of MWSS had no effect on the water supply problems of
provincial cities, whose needs had traditionally been neglected by NWSA.
Consequently, the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA), a semi autono-
mous government corporation, was established in September 1973 to (a) assist
in the formation and development of technically sound and financially viable
locally-controlled water districts (WDs); (b) provide loans to the WDs for
the improvement and expansion of water supply and waste water disposal systems;
(c) provide technical assistance and personnel training for the WDs; and
(d) establish and enforce standards of water quality and service. Currently,
LWUA helps cities with population of 30,000 and more. There are about
300 such communities in the Philippines of which 60 had formed WDs as of
December 31, 1977. To extend further the water supply benefits, the Government
is considering the formation of WDs in communities with populations exceeding
20,000. Since the establishment of LWUA, significantly greater attention has
been directed to the needs of the provincial cities and with the assistance
of international and bilateral aid agencies, water supply projects are under
execution in a number of WDs and feasibility studies are being made for
projects in other WDs.
1.07      Responsibility for water supply in the urban centers, which are not
covered by MWSS and LWUA, as well as in the rural areas, rests with the local
authorities. Several government departments: the Bureau of Public Works,
the Environmental Sanitation Division of the Department of Health and the
Department of Local Government and Community Development assist the local
governments, but coordination is lacking. A water supply and sewerage study
carried out in late 1976 at the Government's request by staff of the IBRD/WHO
Cooperative Program identified serious deficiencies in the provision of basic
water supply services to these communities mainly because of poor institutional
arrangements, lack of trained staff and inadequate operational and maintenance
practices. These deficiencies are being addressed by the government with the
assistance of the Bank and other bilateral agencies.
/1 MWSS still provides support to 82 provincial water supply systems.
The Government has approved the transfer of these systems to local
authorities. The local authorities will be encouraged to form Water
Districts and become eligible for assistance from LWUA (para. 1.06).



-3-
Investment Program
1.08      To remedy the past neglect of this sector, the Government has
embarked upon an ambitious water supply program in the country. In Manila,
the proposed project to be financed partly by the Bank and partly by the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) (para 4.03), will about double the water supply
to 2,500 Mld and by 1987 provide safe drinking water, at adequate pressures,
to about 4 million additional residents as well as improve the present
unsatisfactory service to about 3 million. A sewerage and sanitation improve-
ment project is also included in MWSS' construction program for 1980-1983.
But for these investments the water supply and sanitation services in MMA
will deteriorate further, and the danger to public health will increase.
MWSS' proposed investment in the 6 years 1978-83 would, in nominal terms, be
about 20 times its capital expenditures in the immediately preceding 6 years.
Consequently, MWSS' managerial capabilities will be over-stretched end will
need to be supplemented.   Management and engineering consultants and advisors
financed under the project (paras. 2.08 and 4.20) will help MWSS to implement
the project and upgrade its operational, financial and maintenance capabil-
ities. LWUA's program for assisting WDs in the 5 years 1977-81 would amount to
about $140 million, an average of $28 million per annum as against $12 million
in 1976. For the rural areas, the Five Year Plan envisages an investment of
$155 million, an average of $31 per annum compared with about $2 million per
annum in 1973-76. Despite the efforts of the Government and assistance from
the Bank and other agencies, this target will only be partially achieved
because of the delays in deciding upon a suitable organization to coordinate
the rural water supply sector.
The Bank's Strategy
1.09      The Bank's strategy in the water supply and sewerage sector is to
support the Government's investment program for improving water supply,
sewerage and sanitation facilities and to provide technical assistance and
training for institution building and staff development. A loan of $23 mil-
lion (Loan 1415-PH) made to the Government in 1977 is currently financing
(a) improvement of existing and construction of additional facilities in 6
WDs; (b) feasibility studies for 10 more WDs; (c) feasibility studies and
design for sewerage and sanitation project in Manila; and (d) staff training.
A loan of $85 million is now proposed for Manila Water Supply Project II and
$3.0 million for feasibility and design studies for water supplies in addi-
tional provincial cities and rural areas. The Bank's lending program for
FY80 includes a loan of $85 million for sewerage and sanitation for MWSS; a
loan of $35 million for water supply in 10 additional provincial cities and
in rural areas. Water distribution and sanitation systems for low income
groups provided through integrated packages of housing, roads, and other
infrastructure improvements, are also included in the Bank's FY79 and FY81
programs for urban and rural development. Other multilateral and bilateral
agencies such as ADB, United States Agency for International Development
(USAID), Danish International Development Agency are also assisting the
Government in this sector.

II. THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARIES
The Borrower
2.01      The Borrower will be the Republic of the Philippines and the
beneficiaries will be MWSS and LWUA. The Government will relend, on the same
terms and conditions as the Bank loan, the bulk of the proceeds of the loan
($85.0 million) to MWSS to finance a part of the Manila Water Supply Project
and $2.5 million to LWUA for feasibility studies and detailed design for
water supply projects in provincial cities; it will utilize the balance of
$0.5 million to prepare a rural water supply project.
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System
2.02      MWSS is a wholly government-owned public utility corporation.
Prior to its creation in 1971, responsibility for all water supply and
sewerage systems then existing in the country devolved on the National
Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NWSA), which had been established in June
1955 under the Republic Act 1383. NWSA was a failure and was abolished in
September 1971 (paras. 1.04 and 1.05). MWSS was created in its place under a
new charter (Republic Act No. 6234), primarily to serve the needs of MMA.
Immediately on its creation, MWSS Board reorganized the system, evaluated
each member of the staff, dispensed with the services of some 800 (of the
defunct NWSA's 2,700 employees) and assigned others to positions for which
they were qualified. This helped instill discipline and boost staff morale as
well as improve their efficiency and productivity.  Other major steps taken
in 1974 to strengthen MWSS' financial position were the restructuring of its
capital and raising of water and sewerage tariffs.  Since then MWSS has been
developing steadily and shows signs of becoming a reasonably good utility.
Organization
2.03      MWSS is organized and functions as a modern public utility with
a fair degree of autonomy. Overall control and responsibility for policy
decisions and supervision is vested in a Board of Trustees consisting of
5 members: a Chairman, 3 Trustees and a General Manager (who is also
the ex-officio Vice-President of the Board), all appointed by the President
of the Republic of the Philippines. The Board formulates policies, approves
budgets, recommends tariff adjustments, determines the System's staff
pattern and the number of personnel, fixes their salaries and other emoluments
(subject to government's general directions in these matters) and defines
their powers and duties. It issues necessary regulations for conduct of
business.
2.04      The day-to-day management is vested in the General Manager who
is assisted by four Assistant General Managers (appointed by the Board
subject to the approval of the President of the Philippines) one each for
engineering; operations; finance and administration; and commercial and
customers services; and 13 Heads of Department who work under the
Assistant General Managers. In addition, there are the Legal Assistance,
Management Services, Public Relations and the Provincial Services Offices.



- 5 -
2.05      The engineering de-irtment is responsible for the conception,
design and construction of new works. It also has the Office for Special
Projects (OSP)/1 which is responsible for the Manila Water Supply Project II.
The operations department consists of divisions of sources, treatment,
distribution and sewerage. The commercial department has divisions for
customer services, meter reading, billing and collection. The finance and
administration department is responsible for administration, accounting and
financial planning. This organizational structure is basically good and MWSS
has agreed that before any major changes are made in this structure in
future, it will give the Bank an opportunity to comment on the proposed
changes.
Management
2.06      The present Acting General Manager is experienced and qualified
and has the capability to satisfactorily manage MWSS. He has the stature
to work with the Government and MWSS Board in the making and implementation
of major policy. The Assistant General Managers are also well qualified and
experienced for their respective positions.
2.07      The OSP is headed by a competent manager/engineer who works har-
moniously with the expatriate consultants assisting with the design and
supervision of construction of the project. He is also the Assistant General
Manager (Engineering). The OSP is also responsible for planning the sewerage
project (para 1.09) and the next stage water supply project. It has been
recently strengthened by the addition of two Project Managers, one for water
supply and another for sewerage. The present management team is competent
and MWSS has agreed that before filling any future vacancies in the key
positions of the General manager, the Assistant General Managers and the
Project Manager (water supply), it will give the Bank an opportunity to
comment on the qualifications and experience of the proposed candidates.
2.08      Though MWSS has made steady progress since its creation in 1971, it
is still weak in its operations, maintenance and financial performance. Un-
accounted for water is high, metering is inadequate and inefficient, mainten-
ance of facilities is poor, and financial results are unsatisfactory. No
attempt has been made to decentralize the operations and maintenance of this
large system and though an increase of 1200 staff is projected over the next
7 years there is no staff development plan or a staff training school. The
heavy investment program on which MWSS will now embark is beyond any compar-
ison with its past achievements and therefore it will need expert advice and
technical and managerial assistance for implementing the program and deriving
its full benefits. For this purpose, the proposed project includes (besides
the engineering consultants for design and construction supervision) the
following management consulting services. Part A of the project will finance
internationally recruited: (a) a manager-adviser for 18 months to assist the
General Manager in coordinating and managing the project; (b) management
consultants for 18 man-months to review and recommend changes in the organi-
zation, and improvements in metering, meter-reading, billing, collections and
/1 Recently established by strengthening what was formerly called the
Project Management Office.

financial planning; (c) an adviser for 9 months to prepare and implement a
planned preventive maintenance program; (d) an adviser for 6 months for leak
detection and repair; and (e) an expert for 12 months to plan and coordinate
the work of the task force (which will be created out of the personnel of
engineering, operations and commercial departments) for installing 400,000
new metered service connections by 1985. The Bank financed Part B project
will help decentralize operations and maintenance functions to 21 offices
(13 in existing premises and 8 in new premises) and organize and equip the
urgently needed water supply staff training school. A water supply training
consultant for 24 months and a ground water consultant (who will also
assist in the construction of the 50 wells in the project) for 12 months
will help set up the training school and formulate and implement the training
program. With the assistance of the management consultants MWSS will also
prepare, by September 1, 1979, a staffing plan to adequately cope with its
expanded activities. This plan will be reviewed annually and implemented in
consultation with the Bank.

in broken lines (Chart No. 18559).

2.10      Billing is computerized and bills are issued to consumers on
monthly cycles. There are very little arrears in billing. Collections are
decentralized and are the responsibility of 15 Branch Offices. Collections
from domestic consumers are mainly through contract-collectors (numbering
about 120) who are remunerated on a graduated scale based on the number of
bills collected. Salaried collectors are employed for collections from
Government, industrial, commercial and other large consumers. As an incen-
tive for higher collection a scheme of monthly "performance bonus" payments
to the staff of top five Branch offices whose collections exceed the pre-
determined targets, was introduced in February 1976. The results of this
scheme have been encouraging. Collection efficiency (amount of collections
multiplied by 100 and divided by the amount of billings) was 98% in 1976
and about 100% in 1977. Current collections (i.e. collections within 3
months of billings) were about 85% both in 1976 and 1977.
2.11      Customers accounts receivable at the end of June 77 amounted to
P 80.8 million (about 7 months billings) against which MWSS had a bad debt
provision of about P 73 million (as of December 31, 1976). The agewise
breakdown of the gross receivables was as follows: due for not more than
4 months P 8.4 million; 4 to 6 months P 3.0 million; 6 to 12 months
P 9.1 million; 1 to 5 years P 41.8 million; 5 to 10 years P 16.7 million
and over 10 years P 1.8 million. Write off of the old irrecoverable bills is
being processed by MWSS and as a first step an amount of P 13.5 million
representing accounts that had remained uncollected for over 10 years (for
the period 1947-66) has been written off. During negotiations agreement was
reached that MWSS will take actions (a) to write off and remove from its
books the receivables which it considers uncollectible and (b) beginning
1980, receivables at the end of each year will not exceed 4 months billings.

Accounts and Audit
2.12      MWSS has adopted a commercial accounting system developed by the
consultants. Accounting is good and the staff which includes a number of
CPAs, are competent. The audit of the accounts is carried out by a resident
'Auditor of the Commission on Audit (COA) who certifies the annual financial
statements and reports to the Board. The audit is independent and is
generally satisfactory. It has been agreed that MWSS' accounts will be
audited by COA or other independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and the
annual audited financial statements and the auditor's report thereon will be
furnished to the Bank within 4 months of the close of each year.
2.13      Prior to 1976, the COA's staff also carried out internal audit
functions. In April 1976, the scope of COA's internal audit was reduced to
cover only certain specified types of transactions and the responsibility for
pre-auditing other transactions was assumed by MWSS. This is carried out
partly by the cashiers and the accounting divisions and partly by the manage-
ment services office. To discharge the internal audit functions efficienty,
MWSS has undertaken to establish and staff an internal audit division
directly responsible to the General Manager and lay down detailed procedures
for internal audit by June 1, 1979.

III. WATER DEMAND
Project Area
3.01      Manila is the capital of the Philippines, the main port of entry and
the industrial, commercial and cultural center for the nation. It is also a
tourist city and in recent times is growing into an international convention
center. MMA has most of the problems of a large metropolis (estimated
1977 population within MWSS service area: 5.8 million) and the need for most
public utility services has outstripped the efforts of the Government to
provide them. Nevertheless, the Government is deeply concerned about basic
needs such as water supply, sanitation and housing on which large investments
are planned for the next six years.
3.02      The project area encompasses (i) the current MWSS service area;
(ii) shore areas reclaimed from Manila bay; and (iii) Muntinlupa, a munici-
pality which was recently approved for inclusion within MWSS' service area.
MWSS' 1977 service area includes 5 major cities and 21 of the 22 munici-
palities that form MMA and 11 contiguous municipalities that are currently
not in MMA. Reclamation of the shore areas is expected to add 664 and 748 ha
in 1982 and 1987 respectively and Muntinlupa, another 4,670 ha. This would
increase MWSS' service area from the present 144,021 ha to 149,355 and
150,103 ha in 1982 and 1987 respectively (Map IBRD 13465). MMA's Human
Settlements Commission (HSC) has recently prepared a land use plan for 1982
to form the basis of zoning regulations to control development. This plan
differs only slightly from the consultants' land use projection which was
developed from a plan prepared by the government in 1975 for the Manila Rapid
Transit Railway Project.
3.03      HSC has designated areas in the north of MMA such as Valenzuela,
Novaliches, Caloocan City B, including parts of Quezon City and in the
south, Paranaque, Las Pinas and Muntinlupa, as areas of "controlled growth".
A relatively fast pace of residential development would be encouraged in
these areas. Some shift of government institutions to the north is taking
place and nonpollutive industries mostly arising from expansion of inner city
industry, would be permitted. In the existing industrial areas of Pasig,
Pateros, Taguig and parts of Paranaque only nonpollutive industries would be
permitted. Commercial activity is expected to expand generally in the same
areas of the city as at present. MMA's fringe areas to the east such as
parts of Marikina, Pateros and Taguig have been designated as "restricted
growth" areas to protect MWSS' future Marikina reservoir catchment and reduce
pollution of Laguna De Bay.
3.04      The concept and layout of the primary water supply distribution
system ring main in the project, (see para. 4.13) relative to MMA's land
use proposals for 1982 are satisfactory. This system has flexibility to
adjust to changes, especially in residential land use, since 75% of the
increase in residential land use in MMA during 1975-82, representing some
1.28 million additional people mostly in the lower income groups, is expected
to take place within the ring main in MMA's inner core areas of Manila,



-9-
Pasay, Quezon City, Caloocan, Navotas, Malabon, San Juan, Mandaluyong
and Makati (total 36,650 ha) with an increase of average population density
from 109 to 144 persons per ha. Outside MMA's inner core area, should the
pattern of land use, both residential and industrial, develop differently
from HSC's plans, the ring main will permit shifts towards the direction of
greatest water demand. There is no reliable land use plan for the period
after 1982. However the next stage project is not expected to be completed
until 1987 and HSC is expected to develop land use plans for the 1982-1990
period in the next 2 years.
3.05      The sparsely populated semi-rural and rural municipalities outside
MMA such as Montalban, San Mateo and Antipolo (1982 population densities of
1.2 to 3.1 per ha) lie outside MWSS' proposed 1982 central distribution net-
work and well systems have been provided in the project for these areas. Two
residential developments are however planned in Antipolo, namely the new town of
Lungsod Silangan and strip development on the highway to the new port of Infanta
on the east coast. Groundwater is available for these developments.
Population
3.06      The population projection for MWSS' service area was developed
by the consultants on the basis of the 1970 and 1975 census results.  The
consultants' projection for natural increase closely follows the medium
assumption made by the Government's National Census and Statistics Office
(NCSO). HSC has accepted the NCSO medium assumption. Because the consultants'
assumption regarding net-immigration is nearer historic levels, their 1985
projected population is about 3% greater than the NCSO medium assumption.
There are also a number of insignificant differences between the consultants,
NCSO and HSC population assumptions for some of the municipalities. As these
differences are too small to affect the design of the facilities to meet the
project needs, the consultants' projection is satisfactory. The population
of MWSS' service area as a whole is increasing at an average compounded
growth rate of 4.5% annually. Annual growth rates are projected to vary from
1.5% in densely populated Manila City to 6.1% in fast growing Valenzuela.
MWSS' service area population in 1975 was 5.3 million and is projected to
increase to 9.2 million in 1987. Population in the intermediate years is
shown in Table T-1 (Annex 1).
Water Supply Zones
3.07      The consultants' demand projections were based upon assumptions
of water demands to meet the needs of each municipality in MWSS' service
area. As this method did not readily provide information on the different
levels of service, a more detailed analysis was made during appraisal
to calculate the population served by the project. Because of the lack of
records several assumptions, sometimes based upon limited data, were made
in making the calculations, the first of which was to establish the part of
MWSS' service area which has piped water service at present and the additional
areas that will be served under the proposed project.



- 10 -
3.08      The MWSS service area has been considered as two zones - the
T'outlying zone" and "inlying zone". The outlying zone is defined as an area
within MWSS' service area boundary that is served by mains of less than
300 mm diameter, or not served at all by MWSS' piped water supply system; the
inlying zone is the balance. The inlying zone at present covers only 34% of
MWSS' service area. It will expand by 28% under the project and will cover
40% of MWSS' expanded 1987 service area. The two zones are illustrated in
Map IBRD 13465 and the areas are given in Table T-2. Details of the popula-
tion in each zone are given in Table T-3.
Domestic Service Categories
3.09      The resident population in both zones obtain water supply for
domestic use either entirely from MWSS, or both from MWSS (for drinking and
cooking) and private nonpotable sources (for washing and bathing), or
entirely through privately developed sources. Based upon three water use
studies made by the consultants and other data, five categories of water
users have been identified: (a) persons with direct connections installed in
their houses; (b) persons who obtain their water regularly from neighboring
households with direct connections who share the water; (c) persons who
draw water from public standpipes; (d) persons who obtain water entirely
from private sources; and (e) persons who obtain water from other sources
such as vendors or industrial supplies. This last category may be taken as
not having access to safe water.
3.10      It is estimated that 8.2 persons are directly served per domestic
connection and this is not expected to change up to 1987. In addition an
average of 3.0 persons per domestic connection obtain water from their
neighbors; such persons may or may not pay for their water and often supple-
ment their "borrowed" supply from nonpotable private sources. As additional
domestic connections are provided under the project, borrowers are expected
to decline to 2.0 persons per connection in 1982-84, but increase slightly
thereafter as the supply constraint is felt, up to the anticipated year of
completion of the next stage project, as shown below:
Year                1975-78   1979   1980   1981   1982-84   1985   1986   1987
Borrowers per        3.0      2.9    2.7    2.2      2.0        2.1   2.1    2.2
connection
3.11      For the category on public standpipes it is estimated that, on an
average, one public standpipe would serve an area of about one hectare. The
number of families served by each standpipe would vary considerably, between
100 and 200. All of the standpipes are located in the densely populated
areas of the inlying zone and it is assumed that the number served by one
standpipe will be about 600 persons and will be the same up to 1987.



- 11 -
3.12      Persons who obtain their water from private sources have been
calculated separately for the two zones. For the outlying zone this is
the difference between the total population in the zone less the number
served by MWSS. The served population is calculated from the number of
domestic service connections for both well and surface water sources. In
the inlying zone it is estimated that between 1975-1981 10% of the total
inlying population, living in subdivisions or living in homes with deep
wells, will be on private supplies. This percentage would reduce to 9% and
8% in 1982 and 1983 as owners having wells in a declining water table
would connect with MWSS. After 1982 because of the supply constraint a
slight increase to 8.3% in 1984 and 1985 has been assumed.
3.13      At present (1978) 91% of the total of 245,000 domestic connections
are in the inlying zone. This will increase to 94% on project completion in
1982. Of the total number of 515,000 services at that time about 8% would be
served from wells. The allocation of domestic service connections between
outlying and inlying zones and between MWSS' ground water serviced system and
MWSS' surface water serviced system is based on (1) historical growth trend
between 1978-1979 of well serviced connections (2) the projected increase in
connections between 1979-1982 from new wells in the project and (3) the shift
in number of wells (and related connections) from outlying to inlying zones
as the inlying zone served by the surface water system expands. The projected
number of domestic connections in each zone is listed in Table T-4.
3.14      MWSS records indicate that there were about 630 standpipes in 1977.
Standpipes are intended to be a temporary measure providing service primarily
in the most blighted areas of Metro Manila. Under the Zonal Improvement
Program (ZIP),/l 415 blighted areas have been identified, of which 380 are to
be upgraded and the remainder relocated. Assuming a minimum of one standpipe
per hectare, about 850 standpipes will be needed in the ZIP areas. As ZIP is
implemented and service connections provided, the number of necessary stand-
pipes will decline between 1981-1983 but will then increase beginning in 1984
as new blighted areas may develop and as the supply constraint limits the number
of new connections that can be made. Details are shown in Table T-5.
3.15      Because of the inadequate supply, the present low rate of new
industrial service connections will continue. Only about 2,200 new connec-
tions will be given between 1978-1980. From then on 1,000 new connec-
tions will be given annually until 1987. Commercial and institutional
connections will also show a sharp increase of 6,800 new connections in
1979-1980 followed by an annual rate of about 3,000 new connections up to
1987. It is assumed that all of the industrial, commercial and institutional
connections will be made in the inlying zone.
/1 This is an on-going program of the National Housing Administration.



- 12 -
3.16      The projected number of service connections within MWSS' service
area is shown in Table T-6. At the time of project completion in 1982 the
total number of connections would have increased from about 263,800 in 1977
to 556,000 - an increase of 292,200 connections representing an average
annual connection rate of 58,440.  Allowing one month for loss of time and
bad weather, MWSS will have to install about 250 connections per day.
Thirty-two service connection inspection crews will work out of the 21 branch
offices to supervise the work of contractors making these connections. This
will therefore be an achievable target for MWSS' proposed decentralized
operations.
Population Served
3.17      The population served is calculated by multiplying the number of
domestic connections by the number of users in each category of service.
Table T-7 gives details of population served in MWSS' Inlying Zone from wells
and surface sources in the different categories. About 3.3 million (74%) of
the 1977 population in the inlying zone are served either by direct connec-
tions, standpipes or private supplies. The remaining population which now
gets water from no easily indentifiable source, will have access (either from
standpipes or as borrowers) to safe water on completion of the project in
1982. Table T-8 gives details of population served in MWSS' Outlying Zone.
3.18      When MWSS' service area is taken as a whole, the population with
direct house connections will increase from 33% to 59% of the total popula-
tion between 1978 to 1983, representing an increase of 2,649,000 persons.
People who borrow water from neighbors, would increase from 735,000 to
1,144,000 in the same period, all of the unserved population of 1,273,000
in 1978, would by 1982, have access to safe water. Statistics of population
served under the project are in Table T-9.
Water Consumption and Sales
3.19      An analysis of the 1967-1975 service records of 400 metered
domestic connections in areas with continuous service and adequate pressure
is the basis of the following assumptions on domestic water consumption:
Consumers/
Annual Income Level                        Consumption   Connection
Upper Income        P 60,000 and above       525 lcd           6.6
Middle Income       P 6,000 to 60,000        235 lcd            7.4
Lower Income        P 6,000 and below        130 lcd           9.0
Weighted average         195 lcd           8.2



- 13 -
3.20      Such ideal conditions of pressure and service periods do not
presently exist in most parts of MMA and average consumption, by those who
are directly served, is lower than 195 lcd at about 180 lcd. With slight
changes to allow for the improved pressures and stepped increase in supply
with completion of the Balara plant improvements and two phased commissioning
of La Mesa plant, consumption is expected to peak at about 200 lcd in 1982 before
declining to 194 lcd in 1987.
3.21      Consumption per "borrower" is estimated at a range of 30-50 lcd
(average of 40 lcd). In the absence of reliable data, the same assumption
is made for persons who are indirectly served. This consumption rate is
consistent with MWSS' records of water consumption in 1975 and 1976. Persons
using standpipes use 35 liters per capita per day; this includes an allowance
for wastage at the standpipe.
3.22      Total annual domestic consumption is calculated by multiplying
the served population in each category by the estimated per capita consump-
tion as shown in Table T-10. Industrial consumption within the service area
was estimated from land use maps and a sample of selected industry. However
because of groundwater availability only a proportion of this (25% in 1982)
is assumed to be served by MWSS. In the absence of reliable information on
the types of industry likely to connect in each year, annual industrial
consumption is based upon actual total sales of 18 million cu m made to
industry in 1977, giving an average sale of 9,800 cu m per connection. From
1983-1986 some unutilized water (17, 28, 23 and 19 million cu m in each year)
is allocated to industrial sales to allow for decline in groundwater levels,
which will probably lead to the abandonement of some private wells. Construc-
tion of the next stage project is expected to commence in 1983 for completion
in 1987. Should commencement of the next stage project be postponed beyond
1987, the capacity constraint would require industrial sales to be held
level, as all available increments of water would be needed for domestic
use.
3.23      Commercial and institutional sales are calculated and projected
in a similar way as the industrial sales. Actual sales of 87 million cu m in
1977 gave a consumption rate of 4,240 cu m per connection per year. A rate
of 4,200 cu m per connection has been assumed up to 1987.
3.24      Field surveys indicate that actual domestic consumption exceeds
billings by about 15% (sales/consumption ratio of 0.87) because of under-
registration of meters and use of average consumption billings on accounts
with faulty meters. The calculation of water sales to industrial, commercial/
institutional connections has been proportionately increased to estimate
industrial and commercial/institutional consumption. The improvements to be
made in MWSS' metering and meter reading efficiency and the installation of
new meters are estimated to reduce the excess of consumption over sales
causing a gradual increase in the sales/consumption ratio to 1.0 in 1985.
Annual water sales and consumption are shown below:

Unaccounted for Water
3.25      In 1976 and 1977 unaccounted for water, (production less sales)
calculated as a percentage of production, was 50.0% and 48.0% respectively.
During 1977 about 8% of production i.e. 38 million cu m went unrecorded
because of under registration of meters and the use of average consumption
billing. Another 10% of production was taken by MMA in municipal use such as
fire fighting, watering of parks and roads and by MWSS in testing pipelines
and flushing mains. The bulk of the unaccounted for water, 30.0% of produc-
tion, was lost in leaks, illegal connections and theft. MWSS has set for
itself targets to reduce leakage and theft to 25% and 20% in 1982 and
1985 respectively and plans to charge, wherever possible, for water used in
watering of parks and roads to reduce unrecorded municipal use by half.
MWSS would also control its own use and by 1984 reduce municipal and MWSS
use to 5% of production. The supply capacity, production and water use in
the various categories is illustrated in Chart 18659.
3.26      With improved metering, leak detection and repair and more efficient
operations MWSS should be able to reduce gradually the unaccounted for water
to about 25% by 1986. MWSS has agreed to prepare, by January 1, 1979, an
implementation program, acceptable to the Bank, for reducing unaccounted for
water caused by leakage, theft, firefighting, watering of parks and roads,
testing of pipes and flushing of pipelines. The projected annual water
production sales and unaccounted for water from 1976 to 1987 are shown
below:

IV. THE PROJECT
Objectives
4.01      The proposed project was prepared by MWSS, with the assistance of
Camp Dresser and McKee International Inc. (CDM) of USA; project preparation
was financed by a loan from the Asian Development Bank. The project is in
conformity with Government's development strategy to improve access to safe
water supplies to the urban population, with particular emphasis on providing
this basic need to the lower income groups.
4.02      The primary objective of the project is to improve access to safe
water supplies to the population of metropolitan Manila by (a) developing
fully the present major source of supply at Angat river; (b) carrying out
rehabilitation and extension to the water distribution system; and (c)
assisting MWSS into becoming an efficient public utility. The proposed
project is a continuation of the work started by the Bank in the first stage
project. The project also includes feasibility studies and detailed designs for
provincial cities and the preparation of a rural water supply project.
4.03      The principal features of the project are summarized below:
Part A
(a)  source development to increase water production capacity from
about 1,300 Mld to 2,500 Mld including modification to the existing
Angat powerhouse, the construction of a dam, aqueduct, treatment
plant and miscellaneous rehabilitation works;



- 16 -
(b) construction of about 65 km of primary and secondary pipelines to
serve North Manila including bulk supply to Tondo and Dagat-Dagatan;
(c) construction of new reservoirs and pumping stations at Bagbag,
Bonafacio and Kawit including rehabilitation of existing pumping
stations; construction of meter maintenance facilities and
installation of service connections and meters;
(d) technical assistance for institutional development (63 man months);
and
(e) consultant services for project implementation.
Part B:
(a) construction of about 150 km of primary networks and about 520 km
of secondary networks, including river crossings, pipe rehabili-
tation, tertiary network and service connections;
(b) construction of about 50 deep wells including pumps and storage
reservoirs;
(c) acquisition and installation of 520,000 domestic and 18,000
industrial/commercial water meters;
(d) construction and provision of equipment, vehicles and tools for
8 operations and maintenance branch offices and upgrading of
13 existing branch offices;
(e) construction and equipping of a water supply training school;
and
(f) technical assistance for Project implementation (180 man months)
and staff development (36 man months).
Part C:
(a) detailed designs for water supply projects in provincial cities for
which feasibility studies are being carried out under Loan 1415-PH
of May 13, 1977; and
(b) feasibility studies for water supply projects in provincial cities.
Part D:
Preparation of a rural water supply project.

Existing System
4.04      The existing major surface source development consists of a
large multipurpose dam on the Angat river and a small downstream dam at Ipo,
diverting Angat hydropower tailrace releases from an auxiliary powerhouse
through two tunnels and three parallel aqueducts, conveying about 1,100 Mld
by gravity to Novaliches reservoir, situated 21.5 km south of Ipo. Novaliches
reservoir formed by La Mesa dam on the Novaliches river also receives water
from a diversion dam on nearby Alat river. The Novaliches-Alat system
additionally supplies an average of 160 Mld. Finally, a pump station on the
Marikina river contributes about 90 Mld, and the total supply of 1,350 Mld is
treated in two independently operated treatment plants at Balara, in Quezon
City, northeast of MMA. In addition, about 3 Mld is obtained from groundwater.
First Stage Project
4.05      The First Stage project financed by the Bank in 1964 included works
in source development, treatment and improvements to the primary distribution
system. A second new 6.4 km long 1,135 Mld capacity tunnel from Ipo dam to
Bicti, followed by the third 14.9 km Bicti-Novaliches and 3.1 km Novaliches-
Balara aqueducts, each with a capacity of 757 and 852 Mld respectively, were
provided. At Balara two sets of sedimentation basins, six basins to a set
and each set with a capacity of 379 Mld, and a bank of 8 rapid gravity
filters with a total capacity of 303 Mld were built. Chemical dosing and
chlorination facilities were also provided. The First Stage project did not
include secondary or tertiary distribution mains and in 1977 only 34% of the
population living in MWSS' service area had house connections. Because of
the age of the system and faulty service connections, leakage losses are
about 30% of production. The standard of maintenance of the pumping stations
and the distribution system has room for considerable improvement. Details
are at Tables T-11, T-12 and T-13 and the facilities are illustrated in IBRD
Maps 13465 and 13466.
Supply System Optimisation
4.06      A recent updating of the hydrological studies made when Angat dam
was built in 1962, not only confirms the earlier finding that an annual
average of 1,892 Mld (21.8 cums) could be released for water supply, but also
that adequate regulating capacity is available in Angat storage reservoir to
balance seasonal variations in MWSS' demand for raw water from a maximum of
2,470 Mld (28.6 cums) during the dry January-June months, gradually coming
down to a low 1,608 Mld (85% of 1,892 Mld) in the wet months. The other
components of the supply system - Ipo, Novaliches and Alat catchments with
the Marikina river pump station - would take up the difference to provide
a maximum day demand of 3,100 Mld, i.e., 1.25 times average day demand of
2,500 Mld.
4.07      The costs in present value terms of developing alternative water
sources to meet the needs of MMA are shown in Table T-14. The very large
Marikina-Kaliwa development (4,200 Mld incremental yield) would probably be
marginally the most economical, if MWSS were able to expand its services



- 18 -
rapidly enough to make full use of this source. However, MWSS' limited
financial resources and implementation capacity and the desirability of
restricting MWSS' initial capital investment (which would be P 1.5 billion
for developing Angat compared to P 5.0 billion for Marikina-Kaliwa) makes it
appropriate to develop the existing Angat source to its full capacity before
turning to another and much larger development. However, the development of
the Marikina source is now being studied in detail as the basis of the next
water supply project in MMA.
4.08      The change in reservoir operating patterns which will enable the
Angat yield to be utilized would have entailed a small loss of generating
capacity in the existing hydroelectric installations. To compensate for
this, a new 10 MW turbine will be installed in the auxilliary power house and
will utilize the releases made for water supply (para 4.06). The 10 MW
turbine is included in Part A of the project. The three major components of
the complex transmission system which conveys water from Angat to MMA, also
need extension and rehabilitation, to increase conveyance capacity to
2,470 Mld. Operational advantages, disruption of service and redundancy,
were important considerations in the final judgements between equal or close
alternatives, which were studied by mathematical modelling techniques. A new
30 m high mass concrete dam at Ipo, with a crest of El. 100 and lining the
crown of existing Tunnel No. 1, to improve its hydraulic efficiency is the
least cost alternative for transmitting water from Ipo to Bicti (see Table T-15).
A new fourth parallel 3.4 m diameter 14.9 km long aqueduct will convey water
from Bicti to the Novaliches treatment plant. Treating the water near Bicti
and building a treated water aqueduct to Novaliches, is not only more costly,
but also has some operational shortcomings. All the works in source develop-
ment and transmission are included in Part A of the project.
4.09      At Novaliches, the raw water will be treated in the existing Balara
treatment plant, which will be upgraded to produce 1,600 Mld, and in a new
treatment plant at La Mesa, with a capacity of 1,500 Mld making a total of
3,100 Mld, equivalent to maximum day demand. The new La Mesa treatment
plant is of conventional desigh with horizontal flow sedimentation basins.
Twenty four dual media anthracite filters rated at 14.5 meters per hour have
been proposed, as being the most cost effective. This design is based upon
long experience in treating Angat water and on pilot studies made at the
existing plant and is acceptable. The new plant and cost of upgrading the
existing Balara plant is included in Part A of the project.
Distribution System Alternatives
4.10      Based upon the land use studies, the areal distribution of demand
by administrative areas was aggregated into 10 new service zones according to
the location and type of supply provided, to distribute an average treated
water demand of 2,500 Mld to meet 1982 needs. In each zone, principal areas



- 19 -
of demand, identified on site, formed the basis of pipe layouts for prelim-
inary hydraulic analysis of the secondary distribution system. After refine-
ment, and finalization of the network layout, "nodes" of inputs and outputs
were identified for the computer analysis of the primary distribution system,
and the previously defined service zonal boundaries adjusted as needed during
design.
4.11      For the design of the distribution system MWSS has selected criteria
based upon service standards which are reasonable and acceptable to most of
the consumers. The selected maximum normal head of 70 m in the primary and
secondary distribution systems is suited to ground elevations in the service
area. The design minimum head of 6.0 m in the secondary distribution system,
for 1982, may not be high enough to altogether discourage residential storage
and booster pumping. However, because the network is designed for an average
per capita consumption of 215 lcd which is 10% higher than the 195 lcd esti-
mate made during appraisal, the average minimum head will be higher, at a
little over 7.0 m. This would help towards increasing peak hour flows,
since the selected peak hour factor of 1.8 for the secondary system would
also increase to about 2.25. The lower income groups served by the small
diameter tertiary network would therefore have a consumption at about the
design level of 130 lcd. An important design criterion which will affect
this consumption is the proposed laying of the secondary distribution system
pipes in alternate streets or at a maximum spacing of 150 m. This has the
advantage of allowing for infilling in the future, with pipes sized to meet
the actual demand, based upon a better knowledge of the rate of growth of
population and the per capita consumption than at present.
4.12      As far as possible maximum use is made of existing elements,
booster pumping kept to a minimum and the various storage options (stand
pipes, overhead storage, ground storage) weighed against pumping and gravity
supply to achieve the least cost distribution system.
4.13      Based upon the positions, elevations and capacities of La Mesa,
Balara and the future Nangka treatment plants and the need to transfer large
quantities of water to the south, three transmission alternatives were
compared for the 1982 and 1990 situations: (a) split flows at La Mesa;
(b) extend San Juan service area or; (c) provide a transmission ring main
connecting Balara and La Mesa. The transmission ring sized for 1982 needs,
is the least cost and the best alternative, because of its large capacity and
inherent flexibility to meet changes in needs because of land use planning
errors.  For example any unforeseen shift of demand to the north, up to about
200 Mld, can be accommodated with relative ease. Within the ring, the
existing system forms a distribution grid together with the Balara-San Juan
artery.  Three new reservoirs form part of the transmission ring system:
Pasig, 80 Ml; Fort Bonifacio, 30 M1; Bagbag, 200 Ml, and one standpipe at
Kawit of 11 Ml. At Pasig and Fort Bonifacio, 175 Mld and 170 Mld booster
pump capacities will be provided in two new pumping stations. In the exist-
ing pumping stations, the storage pumps at Caloocan, D. Tuazon, Makati,
Tondo, Algeciras and Ermita will be modified and additional booster pumping
will be provided at Espiritu, Pasay, Makati, Cubao and Balara. All this work



- 20 -
is included in Part A of the project together with 20 km of the primary and
45 km of secondary pipelines required urgently to serve the low income
areas of north Manila, Tondo and Dagat-dagatan. Part B of the project has
the following pipelines: about 700 km of the tertiary system, 50 mm and 75 mm
diameter; 520 km of the secondary system, 150 to 250 mm diameter and 150 km
of the primary system, 300 to 2,600 mm diameter.
Meters, Service Connections and Public Standpipes
4.14      Though 82% of MWSS' service connections are metered most of these
meters are either defective or in such an advanced stage of dilapidation as
to need replacement within the next few years. The project provides 140,000,
1/2" domestic meters in Part A and 520,000 in Part B. These are adequate to
meet MWSS' needs during the project period. Also included are related com-
ponents for the installation of these meters, in giving new service connec-
tions up to the property line, replacing approximately 130,000 existing
leaking service connections and providing public standpipes in selected
blighted areas. In addition 18,000 industrial and commercial meters are
included in Part B. The pumping stations in the proejct would also be
metered.
Well Systems
4.15      Based upon a comparison of the cost of extending the central piped
system with that of providing water from deep wells, well systems are found
to be economical in MWSS' outlying zone as follows: Valenzuela (3), San
Mateo (1), Montalban (2), Canta (3), Taytay (2), Antipolo (12), Imus (2),
Noveleta (2), Rosario (5), Muntinlupa (6) and Cavite City (12). Each well
system consists of the required number of wells, storage reservoir, distri-
bution pipes and service connections, all of which are included in Part B of
the project. In addition about 50 man months of consultants services are
included in the total of 180 man months for construction supervision (see
para 4.20) for making a groundwater survey of MWSS Service area and providing
conjunctive use of groundwater wherever feasible.
Institutional Development and Training
4.16      Part A of the project has a large technical assistance component
for developing MWSS into an efficient utility (para 2.08). Part B of the
project provides for the establishment of 21 offices (8 in new premises and
13 in existing premises including pumping stations which will be upgraded)
for operations and maintenance and a training school, all complete with the
necessary operational equipment and vehicles. The training program includes
not only classroom and on-the-job training, but also the overseas training of
about six trainers and other MWSS technical staff. A substantial part of the
training will be in ensuring project objectives for achieving new service
connection targets, improved maintenance and leakage reduction and developing
groundwater supplies. A special training division, the head of which will
report to the General Manager will be created to plan and implement the
training program. The objective of the training program is to enable MWSS to



- 21 -
become self-sufficient in identifying and meeting its manpower development
needs. A water supply training consultant is included in the project for a
period of two years to assist MWSS in achieving this objective. MWSS has
agreed to create and staff a training division not later than June 1, 1979.
Parts C and D of the Project
4.17      The feasibility and detailed design studies in these two parts will
be carried out by LWUA and the Government respectively. Part C includes
150 man months and Part D 40 man months of internationally recruited
consultant services with related equipment, groundwater investigations,
training and inputs by local consultants for (i) making detailed design for
12 cities and feasibility studies for 16 additional cities and (ii) prepar-
ation of a rural water supply project.
Cost Estimates
4.18      The summary project cost estimates are given below.  The detailed
cost estimates for Parts A and B are at Tables T-16, 17 and 18 and the

4.19       The costs for the works are consultants' estimates developed from a
study of recent bids received on some of the ADB and USAID financed water
supply projects. The foreign exchange costs include both direct and indirect
costs and are also based upon consultants' estimates. The total foreign
exchange cost of 47% is only a little lower than that in the smaller Provin-
cial Cities Water Supply Project (Loan 1415-PH) in which it was 49%. In Part
A, the foreign exchange cost is 52%, because of imported treatment plant
equipment, compared with 45% in Part B, in which most of the larger pipes
in the transmission ring are expected to be of noncylinder prestressed
concrete, which requires more local materials. The cost estimates do not
include duties and taxes on imported goods, since MWSS will be reimbursed
such charges (para 5.21). All prices are adjusted to a baseline of June 1978
and are reasonable.
4.20       CDM will, under their ongoing ADB financed contract with MWSS,
prepare detailed designs and contract documents, invite tenders and evaluate
bids for both Parts A and B. Supervision of construction will, however, be
financed for the two respective parts, by ADB and the Bank and carried out by
the same consultants. The amount of P 53.4 million provided for this in
Part B is 5% of the baseline cost and is reasonable. In addition twelve man
months of consultant services are provided for supervision of construction of
the wells in the project and training MWSS staff in developing groundwater.
The cost of land acquisition is included in Part A and no major problems of
land acquisition for the wells and pipelines are anticipated. During nego-
tiations agreement has been reached with MWSS that land acquisition will be
carried out in accordance with a timetable consistent with the construction
program, as shown in the implementation schedule (Chart 18658). Part B of
the project provides for a total of 180 man months of expatriate construction
supervision services at an average man-month cost, excluding transportation
housing and local costs, ranging from US$5,600 - $8,800 depending on quali-
fications and experience. This is reasonable. MWSS will employ engineering,
training and groundwater consultants, whose experience and terms and con-
ditions of employment are acceptable to the Bank. LWUA and Government will
also employ engineering consultants (para. 4.17) whose experience and terms
and conditions of employment are acceptable to the Bank.
Contingencies
4.21       The cost estimates for Part B are based on quantities derived from
preliminary designs prepared by the consultants. Most of the works in the
project are below ground and all of the work in Part B is in the construc-
tion of pipelines of varying diameters in or near built up areas. Though inves-
tigative trial holes have been made, the possibility remains of unforeseen
obstructions, corrosive soils and poor foundation conditions and a physical
contingency provision of 15% has been made in the cost estimates. This
provision is reasonable for work of this type. The estimates for Part A of
the project are largely based upon final designs and a reduced physical con-
tingency provision of 11% has been made. This is also a reasonable provision.
There are no physical contingency provisions for engineering, consultant
services, or land.

4.22      Price increases in water supply construction in the Philippines
are lower than estimated in 1977. At that time, 10% in 1978 and 1979 and
8% in 1980-81, was provided in the Provincial Cities Water Supply Project
(Loan 1415-PH). On the basis of discussions with the National Economic
Development Authority and with the agreement of ADB, the consultants have
made provision for price increases as follows: for local expenditures, 8% in
1979-83; for foreign expenditures, 8% in 1979-81, 7.5% in 1982 and 7% in
1983.  This provision is reasonable.  The total of US$23.4 million (P 173.0 mil-
lion) provided for price increases in Part B, is 14% of the baseline cost plus
the physical contingencies.
Financing Arrangements
4.23      For the Manila Water Supply Project II, ADB made a loan of
$51.3 million to MWSS in August 1974 and is currently considering a proposal
to make a further loan of about $49.0 million, to cover in full the foreign
exchange expenditures of Part A of the project. Of the proposed Bank loan of
$88.0 million, $85.0 million will finance the estimated foreign exchange
expenditures of Part B, or about 22% of the total project cost. The local
costs of P 1,545.5 million ($208.8 million) will be met by MWSS from its
internal cash generation and from the funds to be provided by the Government.
The balance of $3.0 million of the proposed Bank loan will finance the cost
of engineering consultants to be employed by LWUA and the Government for
detailed design and feasibility studies for water supply projects in pro-
vincial cities and for preparation of a rural water supply project.  Local
counterpart staff for these studies will be provided by LWUA and the Govern-
ment from their regular establishments and, therefore, no additional local
costs will be involved. The financing plan of MWSS for the project con-
struction period is in para. 5.07.
Procurement
4.24      Procurement of equipment and civil works contracts for Part B will
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with current Bank Group Guidelines. A preference limited to 15% of the c.i.f.
price of imported goods or the prevailing custom duty, whichever is lower,
would be extended to local manufacturers in the evaulation of bids. MWSS'
local procurement procedures are satisfactory and appropriate for contracts
covering installation of meters and construction of public standpipes
(P 37.8 million), construction of branch offices, training school and
purchase of related equipment (P 6.8 million) and well drilling
(P 13.6 million). These works, which represent about 4% of the Part B
project cost, will be advertised in accordance with local procedures which
are acceptable to the Bank. There is potentially adequate local competition
and foreign firms can participate. Off-the-shelf items, each costing less
than $20,000 equivalent urgently needed for the rehabilitation works, ensuring
that the metering targets are kept and for equipping the branch offices and
training school would also be purchased under MWSS' local procurement pro-
cedures which are acceptable to the Bank. The total cost of such items would
not exceed $500,000 equivalent.



- 25 -
Disbursements
4.25      Disbursements for civil works would be made at 100% of foreign
expenditures for mobilisation and at 40% of expenditures for other civil
works. For equipment and materials, disbursements would be at 100% of the
foreign exchange cost of directly imported equipment, 100% of the ex-factory
price of locally manufactured equipment and 65% of goods procured locally.
For costs of consultants and training, disbursements would be 100% of
expenditures. The quarterly disbursement forecast is shown in Table T-19.
Design, Construction and Supervision of Construction
4.26      MWSS will be responsible for carrying out the project.  CDM will
assist in preparation of detailed designs and bid documents, evaluation of
bids and supervision of construction. The Office for Special Projects will
provide the overall supervision and administration for project implementa-
tion. The Project Manager (Water Supply) will be responsible for the day-to-
day liaison with CDM and other consultants in the project, including approval
of technical proposals and all matters related to procurement.
Implementation Schedule
4.27      Implementation of Part B is expected to begin in September 1978,
with completion of all works in June 1983.  The closing date of the proposed
loan is six months later - December 31,1983, to allow for unforeseen delays.
Completion of the upgrading of Balara treatment plant, from 1,200 to 1,600
Mld in mid-1979, will bring some relief to consumers presently experiencing
low pressure. One half of the La Mesa treatment plant, is expected to be
ready in mid-1980 and will give additional supplies to the Tondo and Dagat-
Dagatan areas. However, appreciable benefits from the project will not
result until end 1982, with the completion of the ring main. The implementa-
tion schedule for the project is at Chart 18658.
Environmental Impact
4.28      The proposed project would directly improve the environment of
MWSS' service area. It will, however, increase the quantities of waste water
requiring disposal. A sewerage and sanitation project is therefore under
preparation and is planned for implementation beginning 1981. This project
would ensure that most of the waste waters are disposed of safely. Also, at
the La Mesa plant a provision is made in the design for lagooning treatment
plant wastes. Because of recent government policy to permit only nonpollutive
new industry within MMA no appreciable increase in pollutive industrial wastes
is anticipated. No unusual environmental hazards are foreseen because of the
project.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Results and Financial Position
5.01      NWSA, MWSS' predecessor was a weak organization and incurred losses
continuously until it was dissolved in 1971. In the first three years of its
operations, FY72 (July 1971-June 1972) through FY74, MWSS also incurred losses
of an average of about P 11.0 million each year. However, in May 1974.
Government took two major steps: (a) raising water tariffs by about 100%; and
(b) converting all previous loans into subscribed capital: which helped MWSS
turn the corner and produce net surpluses of P 48.0 million in FY75 and
P 46.3 million in FY76. Table T-20 shows, in an abbreviated form, the
financial results of MWSS' operations in FY72 through FY76.
5.02      In none of the years since its inception, has MWSS made a cash
loss. Its revenues fully covered the cash operating costs as well as depre-
ciation but in the first three years (FY72 through FY74) it failed to meet,
in full, the interest charges on its borrowings. The rate of return on the
book value of its net fixed assets in operation ranged between 1% and 4%.
5.03      Effective 1976, MWSS' financial year has been changed to coincide
with the calendar year. For CY76, the operating surplus was P 32.2 million
and net surplus (including interest earnings) P 48.0 million. The rate of
return on net fixed assets was about 2.8%.
Future Position
5.04      MWSS' investment program for water supply and sewerage facilities
in MMA during the six years 1978-83 is of the order of P 5 billion which
amounts to almost twenty times the investment it made in the preceding six years.
Water production will be doubled, water sales will rise by about 140% and the
number of water connections will increase from 268,000 to 612,000. Such a
huge expansion in its activities will demand a strict financial discipline
and monitoring of its performance. The management consultants (para. 2.08)
will assist MWSS in financial planning and achieving the objective of trans-
forming MWSS into a sound and financially strong utility capable of producing
satisfactory rates of return (para. 5.14).
5.05      MWSS' Charter limits its authorized capital to P 1.0 billion; local
borrowings to P 1.0 billion and foreign borrowings to $200 million.
Presently, about half the capital is paid up, there are no local loans and
the amount drawn and outstanding against foreign loans is about $18 million
(amount committed is about $70 million). In view of the large investment
program ahead, MWSS Board recently recommended that these limits be tripled and
raised to P 3 billion, P 3 billion and $600 million, respectively. It
also proposed that the Government's capital contribution to MWSS be not less



- 27 -
than P 250 million every year until the authorized capital is fully paid up.
These changes have been approved by the Government.
5.06      Financial projections: income statement, statement of sources
and application of funds, and balance sheets- for MWSS' water supply and
sewerage operations through 1985 are in Annex 2. The assumptions for the
projections are in Annex 3.

- 29 -
5.08       The capital expe-diture program of about $692 millior during the
six years 1978-83 includes Manila Water Supply project II; Manila sewerage
and sanitation project; first year's expenditure on the next stage water
supply project (Marikina project expected to begin in 1983); other minor
capital works; and interest during construction. Internal cash generation
will meet $216 million (31%); foreign borrowings $246 million (36%); Government
funds $216 million (31%) and consumers' contributions $14 million (2%) of the
estimated capital expenditures. Of the projected foreign borrowings of
$246 million, $85 million will be financed by the proposed Bank loan, $5 mil-
lion by the existing Bank loans and $97 million by the ADB loans; the source of
financing for about $60 million representing MWSS' currently estimated
foreign exchange expenditures on the Manila sewerage and sanitation project
has not been determined yet (that project is included in the Bank's lending
program for FY80). The financing plan assumes that the Government funds will
be made available to MWSS partly as equity contribution ($121 million) and
partly as loan ($95 million). The above financing plan envisages a reason-
able mix of internal cash generation, foreign borrowing and government
equity/loan and is satisfactory.
5.09      The financial projections show that for implementing the proposed
Manila Water Supply project only, MWSS will need an injection of the Govern-
ment funds of about $166 million in 1978-81 ($95 million as loan and $71 mil-
lion as equity contribution). The balance of about $50 million of the
projected Government equity contribution will benefit the Manila sewerage and
sanitation project.
5.10      During negotiations the Government has agreed that for the
successful completion of the proposed Manila Water Supply project II, it
will make available to MWSS adequate funds, as needed, including any
cost overruns and shortfalls in MWSS cash generation, on terms satisfactory
to the Bank. A condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan will be the
execution of a Loan Agreement between MWSS and ADB for an additional amount
of about $49 million.
Water Tariffs and Rate of Return
5.11      MWSS' current water rates which have been in existence since May
1974 are too low. Domestic consumers pay P 0.20 per cu m (10 cents per
1,000 US gallons) for the first 30 cu m of monthly water consumption (with a
minimum monthly charge of P6.50 including P 1.50 as service maintenance
fee), P 0.40 per cu m for the next 20 cu m and P 0.60 per cu m for consumption
above 50 cu m. For commercial consumers there is a uniform rate of P 0.60
per cu m and industrial consumers are charged P 0.80 per cu m. The average
revenue is P 0.5 per cu m. These rates are totally inadequate because MWSS'
operating costs have almost doubled since May 1974. The operating results
for 1977 show a surplus of P 25.7 million; a rate of return of about 2% on
the book value of net fixed assets in operation which will drop to about 1%



- 30 -
if the assets are revalued at current prices. On the existing rates, MWSS
would just break even in 1978 or show a small loss. MWSS' Board was seriously
-concerned about this situation and made proposals for raising the rates to
yield an average revenue of P 0.80 per cu m, while slightly reducing the
existing minimum charge for poor families (consuming up to 10 cu m per month).
The existing and the new rates are shown in Annex 1 - Table T-21. The
proposed rate increase of an average of about 60% is satisfactory. In view
of the poor and intermittent service to the consumers, a higher increase is
not warranted at this stage.
5.12      Under its charter, MWSS is competent to fix the rates but in
actual practice a Presidential approval is required. The new rates have been
approved by the President and will be made effective from October 1978.
5.13      The above rate increase will be the first step in the series of
management actions (metering, leak detection and repair, reducing unaccounted
for water, etc.) and further increases in rates would be needed in subsequent
years to ensure MWSS' financial viability. To reduce wastage and discourage
wasteful consumption of water, MWSS' future pricing of water would aim at
recovering full marginal costs of additional supplies while retaining the
current social rate structure. For this purpose, MWSS has agreed to (a) carry
out an annual review of its water rates in 1979 through 1982; (b) consult with
the Bank on the adequacy of water charges; and (c) implement expeditiously
recommendations arising from such reviews, including the revision of the
tariffs.
5.14      MWSS will, in the coming years, be called upon to meet its largely
increased debt service and also make heavy investments in water supply and
sewerage works to cope with the growing needs of MMA. Its objective is to
become a financially self-supporting utility, generating adequate cash
surpluses (after meeting its operating costs and maintenance expenditures) to
cover its debt service obligations, meet expenditures on normal expansion of
its activities and provide a reasonable part of funds required for its major
capital investments. During negotiations, MWSS has agreed to set and maintain
its tariffs at such levels as would be necessary to achieve a rate of return
of at least 8% on revalued net fixed assets in operation on completion of the
project in 1982. This rate of return will enable MWSS to provide from its
own resources about P 400 to P 600 million annually for capital works,
thereby reducing its dependence on the government funds for expansion of its
facilities. In the intervening years, 1979 through 1981, as the service
levels improve (resulting from additional supply of water and more efficient
management of the system), MWSS will earn a rate of return of at least 3% on
revalued net fixed assets in operation in 1979 (as against the estimated 1%
in 1977) and 5% in 1980 and 1981.



- 31 -
5.15      To achieve the above rates of return, tariffs will need to be
reviewed and adjusted as explained in para. 5.13. The financial projections
assume the following average revenue per cu m in the years 1978 through 1985:
January 1978 - P 0.50 October 1978 - P 0.80- January 1980 - P 1.00;
January 1981 - P 1.25  January 1982 - P 1.70 and January 1984 - P 1.80.
Abit4y to Poy
5.16      Domestic connections account for some 90% of the total service
connections in MMA and the remaining 10% are commercial and industrial. About
three-fourths of the domestic connections are of half inch size and one-fourth
are larger. On an average, the half inch domestic connection is billed about
40 cu m per month and the larger-than-half-inch about 70 cu m. In September
1977, about 19,000 families, or 8% of total domestic connections, were billed
15 cu m or less.
5.17      For a very poor family of 8 members, 15 cu m of water per month
(about 60 lcd) is an adequate consumption. The monthly water charge for this
level of consumption, at the new rates (para. 5.11) would be P 6.00 ($0.81).
Assuming that these families have an income of P 250 ($34) per month (half
the poverty level), the water charge will be about 2.5% of income. The
monthly bill of a domestic consumer who uses 30 cu m (or about 125 lcd)
will be about P 13.50. Assuming that all such consumers are at the poverty
level of P 500/1 per month, the water bill will be about 3% of income. These
charges are within the consumers' ability to pay. To help poor families to
obtain water connections, MWSS has decided that the cost of providing half-inch
service connections, including the cost of water meters (which will be financed
under the proposed project) will not be recovered from the new domestic
consumers and will be absorbed by the general tariffs. Domestic consumers
asking for larger-than-half-inch connections and the commercial and industrial
consumers will continue to pay such charges.
5.18      The projected average rate of P 1.80 per cu m in 1984, involves about
15% annual increase in nominal terms over the new tariff. Adjusting for
inflation of 10% (adopted for projecting operating expenses) and assuming a
growth of some 5% to 6% in real incomes, the 1984 projected tariff will not
involve a higher burden on domestic consumers than about 3% of income as in
para. 5.17.
5.19      Currently, consumers connected to the sewerage system pay an addi-
tional 50% of the water rates. The same percentage of the progressively
increasing water rates (para. 5.15) has been assumed in forecasting sewerage
/1 This is about $100 per capita per annum and is lower than the poverty
threshold stated in footnote 1 under para. 6.03.



- 32 -
revenues. A tariff study is included in the terms of reference of the con-
sultants for Manila sewerage feasibility study (financed from Loan 1415-PH)
which would form the basis for MWSS and Government to review and revise the
charges for sewerage services.
Projected Ratios
5.20      The financial forecasts for the years 1978 through 1985 are based
on the water production as in para. 3.26; a gradual decrease in unaccounted
for water from the current level of 48% to 28% by 1985; and water and sewerage
tariffs as in paras. 5.15 and 5.19. These forecasts show that MWSS' operating
ratio (after depreciation) will decrease from 95% in 1978 to about 50% in
1982 and thereafter. The rate of return on revalued net fixed assets will be
about 3% in 1979; 7% in 1980; 5% in 1981 and between 8% and 9% in subsequent
years. Debt service coverage will not fall below 1.6 times throughout the
projected period; current ratio will be 2.1 or higher and the debt will not
exceed 33% of capitalization in any year. These rates of return and ratios
are satisfactory. The realization of the financial performance as forecast
in the projections will depend on MWSS' ability to execute the project on
schedule, produce and supply the additional quantities of water, raise
tariffs, reduce unaccounted for water, install new service connections,
ensure efficient metering, meter reading, billing and collections, and
exercise adequate control over its operating costs. To measure MWSS' perfor-
mance, project supervision will include the reporting and monitoring, on a
regular basis, of performance indicators and their comparison with the
appraisal forecasts.
Duties and Taxes
5.21      Under its charter, MWSS is exempt from payment of all duties and
taxes. However, a recent Presidential Decree (No. 1177 of July 30, 1977)
requires that government-owned or controlled corporations shall pay income
tax, customs duties and other taxes and fees; provided that organizations
otherwise exempted by law from payment of such taxes/duties may ask for a
subsidy from the General Fund in the exact amount of taxes/duties due; and
provided further that a procedure shall be established by the Secretary of
Finance and the Commissioner of the Budget whereby such subsidies shall
automatically be considered both as revenue and expenditure of the General
Fund. The detailed procedure has not been announced yet but the Budget
Commission has clarified that the payments and the refunds under this decree
will be a paper transaction and no cash transfers will be involved. In the
financial projections estimated duties on materials to be imported for
the project have, therefore, been added to the "assets" (thereby raising the
assets base for rate of return calculation) by a corresponding credit to
Government subsidy under "Equity." Corporate taxes have been ignored since
the payment and refund will not affect the financial results.
Revaluation of Assets
5.22      MWSS last revalued its assets as of 1971 and incorporated the new
values in its books in 1974. It has recently appointed an internal committee



- 33 -
to make recommendations for revaluation of its fixed assets and expects to
receive the committee's report in July 1978. During negotiations it was
agreed that MWSS would revalue its assets annually commencing with the year
1978 and that the revaluation would be in accordance with a basis acceptable
to the Bank.
Debt Control
5.23      The present and forecast debt equity ratio and debt service
coverage are satisfactory throughout the projected period. However, to
safeguard against MWSS incurring additional heavy debt which may jeopardize
its financial position and involve unduly large debt service burden, agreement
was obtained during negotiations that without the Bank's consent MWSS will
not incur any long term debt unless its net income for the 12 months
immediately preceding the incurrence of such debt is at least 1.5 times the
maximum debt service in any future year. With a view to ensuring that during
the project construction period (1978-83), unduly large funds are not allo-
cated by MWSS to capital works other than the Manila Water Supply Project II,
MWSS has also agreed that during that period it would not undertake, without
the Bank's approval, any major capital works (estimated to cost $3 million or
more) and that expenditures for capital works other than the project will not
exceed $6 million in any fiscal year.
VI. JUSTIFICATION
General
6.01      Since about 1966, when implementation problems delayed the First
Stage project, water supply service to Manila has been steadily deteriorating.
Presently over 2.0 million people in one of the world's largest cities, do
not have safe or adequate quantities of water to maintain a reasonable
standard of personal hygiene and health and to enjoy a decent quality of
life. The justification for the proposed project is that it will stop the
deterioration and substantially increase access to safe drinking water to
most of the inhabitants of Metropolitan Manila. It is estimated that by 1987
the project will provide safe water at adequate pressures for an additional
4.0 million people in MMA as well as improve the service to some 3.0 million
who are inadequately served at present. The project will also strengthen
MWSS' management, its project implementation capacity and provide training of
staff.
Least Cost Solution
6.02      For each major project component alternatives were studied with
discount rates of 8%, 10% and 12%. The project, taken as a whole, is the
least cost solution for achieving its objectives.



- 34 -
Service to the Urban Poor 1
6.03      There are no reliable estimates, on the number of urban poor.
According to an estimate based on nutrition, they could be as high as 60%
(3.2 million) of the 1975 population of 5.3 million. Other estimates put
them at about 34% (1.8 million) of the population. Also, peculiarly to
Manila, except for the well known concentrations at the Tondo Foreshore /2
and Bagong Barrio, the urban poor are scattered throughout the city
either in small groups in blighted areas (see Map IBRD 13467), as squatters
on public land or as groups of one or two families living cheek by jowl
with middle and upper income neighbors, or beside industrial and commercial
areas. Under these circumstances, the only method of ensuring that most of
the poor benefit from the project, is to lay the network of pipes in the
distribution system in all of the populated areas of Manila and size the
pipes, not only to meet the needs of the poor, but also the middle and
upper income groups. Special provision is made in the blighted areas and
other densely populated low income areas, for public standpipes for the
very poor and a tertiary grid of small pipes, to reach as many low income
families as possible. It is assumed that roughly half the population (4.6
million) will belong to the urban poverty group in 1987.
6.04      A second peculiar feature in Manila, is the number of people who
borrow water from their neighbors, because they cannot get private connec-
tions themselves and find it more convenient to obtain water in this way,
rather than go to a public standpipe. In 1977 this consumer category was
12% of the total population in MWSS' inlying zone.
6.05      It is estimated that in 1987, of the 4.6 million urban poor
(para. 6.03), 3.3 million or 74% will have reasonable access to safe water;
0.7 million through standpipes, 1.3 million as borrowers and another 1.3 mil-
lion by direct house corrections. The remaining 1.3 million living in the
fringe semi-rural areas of the city will be mostly dependent on unsafe
private water supplies until piped water is provided to them in the next
stage project. About 2.2 million people or 55% of the additional population
of 4.0 million served by the proposed project would be the urban poor.
Assuming a per capita consumption of 100 lcd for the urban poor with house
connections, about 20% of the total domestic consumption in 1987 will be used
by the poor. It is estimated that about 12% of the project cost of $394 mil-
lion or $47 million is directly attributable to the urban poor. Of the loan
amount of $85 million for Manila water supply about $10 million will benefit
the urban poverty group.
6.06      Taking only the incremental number of persons served by direct
house connections and standpipes in 1987 (3.5 million), the capital cost of
providing the incremental service is about US$109 per person. As the

Barrio has 16,800 families on a smaller land area.

development of remote sources is involved, this is a reasonable cost. Also
the present supply will be improved, pressures will remain positive and the
water will not be contaminated.
Employment
6.07      It is estimated that an additional 10,000 jobs for 30 months will
be provided during project construction and MWSS operational staff will be
increased from about 2,800 to 4,000 because of the water supply and sanita-
tion program.
Economic Evaluation
6.08      The incremental economic rate of return for the project was calcu-
lated using water revenues as a minimal measure of the benefits. Currently,
water rates are very low and MWSS has proposed stepping them up while retain-
ing the social rate structure whereby the large domestic consumers and the
commercial and industrial consumers subsidize the residential consumers whose
consumption is low. As the service improves, further increases in water
rates will be made effective (paras. 5.11 and 5.15). Assuming that the
consumers will be willing to pay these increases, the rate of return, based
on 1978 prices, is about 12% (Table T-22). For calculating the IER, the
foreign exchange expenditures were shadow priced at 1.1./1 Sensitivity
analysis indicates that the return could drop to about 10% if the project
costs exceed the current estimates by 20% and could increase to 15% if such
costs were 20% lower than estimated.   The IER is not sensitive to increases
in operating expenses but a decrease of 20% in revenues or postponement of
the project benefits by two years would lower it to about 9%.
6.09      By using water revenues as a surrogate for the project benefits,
the IER of 12% does, in fact, understate the rate of return. It ignores the
consumer surplus or additional value of the total water consumed above the
amount paid for the water. Moreover, the health, fire-fighting and environ-
mental benefits that accrue to the community by improved water supply are not
captured by the water revenues. While it is impossible to quantify these
benefits, their exclusion biases the IER downwards.
6.10      The average incremental cost (AIC) of water to be produced by the
project adopting a discount rate of 12%, is P 1.00 per cu m, about   twice
the present average revenue per cu m realized by MWSS. The AIC is higher
than the top rate for domestic water use and the rate for commercial consumers
by some 66%; and for industrial use by 25%. However, after the October 1978
tariff increase (paras. 5.11 and 5.12), the average tariff will be about 80%
of the AIC tariff and the commercial and industrial users will pay equal to
/1 The traditional Bank shadow pricing approach is used instead of the
Squire-Vander Tak border pricing method so that the calculation of the
average incremental cost can be meaninfgully compared to current water
tariff levels (see GAS 14 EWT Department).



- 36 -
or higher than AIC. The projected average tariff of P 1.80 per cu m in
1984 will, in real terms, be just about equal to AIC. Thus, over the course
of the project, the economically efficient allocation of water resources will
be promoted through the tariff level for large users while cross subsidies
for small consumers are generated through the tariff structure.
Project Risks
6.11      There is adequate provision in the project for engineering con-
sultants to advise MWSS in the design and supervision of construction of
the project. Though much remains to be done, since the 1971 reorganization,
MWSS has come a long way in improving its organization and is reasonably
efficient. Also the economic climate, which contributed partly to the delay
in the implementation of the First Stage project, has improved considerably
in recent times. There is a strong enthusiasm, in the organization's staff
responsible for project implementation, to tackle the water supply (and
sanitation) problems of the metropolis. With the technical assistance
provided under the project (paras. 2.08 and 4.20) the risk of delays or
serious difficulties in the construction of the major project components is
considered small. However, the project would involve a substantial increase
in MWSS' services and there could be some doubt whether MWSS has the institu-
tional capability to efficiently expand its services as rapidly as projected.
The reorganization of MWSS into branch offices for operations and maintenance
will address this problem but that reorganization is yet to take effect.
This risk will be minimized by close and frequent project supervision both by
the Bank and ADB operating in close cooperation and taking advantage of ADB's
proximity to the project. Bank supervision missions will be alert to the
problem and recommend steps during project implementation to foresee and
correct any situation before it seriously affects the project. In order to
maintain its role in the long process of institution building the Bank should
continue its financial participation and accept the risk.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government,
MWSS and LWUA on the following main points:
(a) preparation of a staffing plan (para. 2.08);
(b) decrease in receivables (para. 2.11);
(c) program for reducing unaccounted for water (para. 3.26);
(d) establishment of a training division (para. 4.16);
(e) employment of consultants (para. 4.20);



- 37 -
(f) annual review of water rates (para. 5.13);
(g) rates of return (para. 5.14).
(h) revaluation of assets (para. 5.22);
(i) long-term debt and limit on other capital expenditures (para. 5.23).
7.02      A condition of effectiveness of the loan will be the execution
of a loan agreement between MWSS and ADB for an additional amount of about
$49 million (para. 5.10).
7.03      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of $88.0 million
for a term of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years.

ANNEX 3
Page 1
PHILIPPINES
MANILA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT II
METROPOLITAN WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE SYSTEM
Assumptions in Financial Forecasts
Income Statement
1.        Water and Sewerage Billings.  Water revenues have been forecast on
the projected volume of sales at the average rate of P 0.50 per cubic meter
in January-April 1978, P 0.80 in October-December 1978 and rising gradually to
P 1.80 in 1984. For consumers connected to the sewerage system, sewerage
revenues have been forecast at 50% of the average water rates.
2.        Maintenance Service Revenue.  The forecasts are based on the number
of connections at the current average rate of about P 22.0 per connection per
annum.
3.        Miscellaneous receipts are assumed to increase about 10% annually.
4.        Personnel Costs.  MWSS presently employs about 2,800 persons.  Its
manpower requirements are estimated at about 4,000 by 1985, i.e., an increase
of about 43% over seven years. The personnel costs are projected to increase
by about 12.3% in 1979; 14.5% in 1980; 10% in each of the year 1981 and 1982
and 8% annually in 1983 through 1985 due to hiring of additional staff and
normal increases in staff compensation; about 96% increase through 1985 at
1978 prices. In addition, a 10% annual increase is assumed for inflation.
Personnel costs for sewerage services are assumed at about 12% of the total
personnel costs during 1979 through 1981 and 15% thereafter.
5.        Chemicals.  The projections are based on the 1978 estimated average
cost of F 0.0389 per cubmic meter of water production (excluding production of
wells) escalated 10% annually for increase in prices of chemicals.
6.        Power.  The power requirements per cubmic meter of water production
are expected to decrease gradually from the 1978 level of about 0.1386 kWh/
cubic meter to about 0.078 kWh in 1983 and thereafter as a result of greater
use of gravity transmission. The cost projections are based on the increased
volume of production at the 1978 estimated average rate of F 0.308 per kWh
escalated 10% annually. Power costs for sewerage are based on the estimated
volume of sewage and are escalated 10% annually.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
7.        SuRipq_es Materials and Other Expenses.  These comprise materials-
office and medical supplies; postal, telegraph and telephone expenses, rentals,
insurance of property and other sundry expenses. These are projected to
increase at about half the rate of increase in the number of connections both
for water and sewerage and are escalated 10% annually.
8.        Provision for bad debts has been assumed at about 5% of water and
sewerage billings and maintenance service revenue.
9.        Depreciation has been assumed on straight line basis at 2.5% of the
gross value of revalued assets (excluding land) at the end of the year.
10.       Amortization of Deferred Organization Costs.  The deferred organiz-
ation costs represent expenses incurred at the time of abolition of the former
NWSA and setting up of MWSS. These costs will be fully amortized by 1983.
11.       Non-operating Income.  Mainly interest earned by MWSS on time
deposits.
Statement of Sources and Apllication of Funds
12.       Borrowings.
(a) Proposed IBRD loan for Manila Water Supply Project II- US$ 85.0 mil-
*
lion: rate of interest 7.5 %* grace period 5 years- maturity 20 years.
(b) ADB loans for Manila Water Supply Project II: (i) First loan of
US$51.3 million; rate of interest 7.5%7 grace period 5 years!
maturity 25 years7 (ii) additional ADB loan of US$49.0 million; rate
of interest 7.65%- grace period 5 years- maturity 25 years,
(c)  other loans - Manila Sewerage Project-  Amount US$59.4 million
rate of interest 8%- grace period 5 years- maturity 20 years: and
(d) Government Loan for Manila Water Supply Project II: Amount P 700 mil-
lion; rate of interest 12%Z maturity 20 years.
13.       Government Equity.  This represents the Government's paid up
capital.
14.       Consumers' Contributions.  Represent the projected recoveries from
prospective new consumers (other than 1/2" domestic connections) towards the
cost of providing service connections and the cost of water meters. To help
the poor families in getting service connections no such charge will be made
for 1/2" connections.
15.       Capital Expenditures.
(a)  Manila Water Supply Project - the projections follow the cost
estimates in para. 4.15-
Effective July 1, the interest rate has been revised to 7.9%. This
will not materially affect the financial projections.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
(b) Sewerage Project - projected to start construction in 1980. The
project costs will be revised after the consultants feasbility
report and cost estimates become available in 1979.
(c) Marikina Project. Next water supply project on which work is
estimated to commence in 1983.
(d) Other Capital Works - Water and Sewerage. These are the capital
works outside the project and include MWSS office building;
purchase of equipment; laying of water and sewer mains; and other
miscellaneous works.
16.       Debt Service.  This follows the debt service charges on the loans.
Attachments to Annex 2 contain the details.
Balance Sheet
17.       Fixed Assets.  The projections for 1978 assume an increase of
P 710 million (about 60%) in the value of net fixed assets on account of
revaluation of the fixed assets. In 1979 and each year thereafter the asset
values have been increased by 8% for escalation of prices by a contra credit
to Revaluation Reserve. MWSS' charter exempts it from payment of any duties
and taxes. However, in accordance with a recent Presidential Decree, the
estimated duties on materials to be imported under the project have been
added to the value of fixed assets with a corresponding credit to "Government
subsidy" under equity.
18.       Accounts Receivable (Net) are assumed at about two months billings
for water and sewerage revenues and service maintenance fees.
19.       Inventories are projected to increase about 10% annually through
1981 and thereafter be equal to about half year's expenditure on chemicals
and supplies and materials.
20.       Accounts Payable are assumed to gradually decrease to about two
months expenditures on chemicals, power, and materials and supplies.
