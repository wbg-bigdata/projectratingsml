TURKEY
APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
I.        The development strategy of Turkey aims at the creation of a modern
economy primarily by expanding industry and increasing the productivity of
agriculture. While agriculture remains the larger single sector, industry
has assumed the leading role in economic growth.
ii.       Industrial development is hampered by shortages of technical and
managerial skills. At the expected growth rate of industry, present short-
ages of technicians, craftsmen, semi-skilled workers and managers will per-
sist through the 1970's and will develop into serious bottlenecks if the
supply is not increased.
iii.      Technical training is undergoing reforms to make it more relevant
to the needs of an expanding and changing economy. Programs are being re-
vised and new teaching methods introduced. More equipment and better trained
teachers are needed to meet the demands of the increasing enrollments.
iv.       The proposed project would assist vocational, technical and manage-
ment training in: (a) meeting specific manpower needs; (b) improving the
quality and relevance of technical and management educationk; and (c) expand-
ing the use of new instruction media and the production of scientific equip-
ment. It would have emphasis on equipment (70% of the total cost) rather
than on buildings.
V.        Specifically, the project would comprise the following:
(a) construction and equipment for:
one management training institute, and
six adult training centers;
(b) equipment for:
thirty-two technician schools,
twelve practical trade schools,
one technical teacher training college,
the Science Equipment Production Center, and
the Educational Film, Radio and Television Center; and
(c) technical assistance for guidance on curricula development,
teaching methods and equipment production techniques.
vi.       The management training institute would offer residential courses
of up to three months in general and functional management areas to top level
practicing managers. The adult training centers are to give immigrants from
rural areas instruction in basic skills and an orientation to urban life.



- ii -
vii.      The project schools would be appropriately located in growing
industrial cities and in accordance with the government's policy to de-
centralize economic activity; 39 of the 52 schools would be in the prov-
inces outside Ankara and Istanbul. Links between the schools and industry
would be strengthened.
viii.     There would be adequate numbers of qualified candidates for admis-
sion to the project schools; teaching and administrative staff would be
available.
xi.       The Ministry of Education would be responsible for the implementa-
tion of the project. Accommodation schedules and equipment estimates are
economical and appropriate. The buildings would be designed by consulting
firms and government architects and would be constructed by private firms.
Contracts for civil works and procurement of furniture and equipment would
conform to the Bank's guidelines on international competitive bidding.
Domestic manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be accorded a pref-
erential margin equal to 15X of the c.i.f. costs of competing imports or
the existing rate of import duty, whichever is lower.
x.        The proposed project is estimated to cost US$17.9 million equiv-
alent, with a foreign exchange component of US$12.7 million equivalent.
Implementation of the project would be completed in about four years after
the loan becomes effective.
xi.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$13.5 million to
Turkey. The loan would finance all. foreign exchange costs estimated at
USS12.7 million and interest and commitment charges during construction,
estimated at US$0.8 million. It would be repayable over a 25 year period,
including a grace period of ten years.



I. INTRODUCTION
The Request
1.01      In July/August 1969 a Unesco mission visited Turkcey to identify
an education project which would be suitable for Bank financing. The find-
ings of the Unesco mission were discussed with the government by a Bank
mission in February, 1970. In July, 1970, the government asked the Bank's
assistance in financing a project which had been prepared with help from
Unesco. In September/October 1970, a Bank mission compris:Lng Messrs. S. Z7
Sung (technical educator), S. Futagami (ITV specialist), A. S. Kinawy
(architect), E. Sawaya (economist), R. Ganeff (general educator, Unesco),
M. Krohn (vocational training specialist, ILO) and R. Kerwin (management
consultant) visited Turkey to appraise the project.
1.02      During appraisal the proposed project was modified in agreement
with the Government: (i) to provide some flexibility in regard to future
development of the institutions involved, and (ii) to achieve better util-
ization of available and new capacity. The project would consist of:
a)   construction and equipment for:
- one new management training institute;
- six new adult training centers.
b)   equipment for:
- thirty-two technician schools;
- twelve practical trade schools;
- one technical teacher training college;
- the Science Equipment Production Center;
- the Educational Film, Radio and TelevisiorL Center.
c)   nine man-years of specialists' services and 24 man-
years of fellowships for providing guidance on cur-
ricula, introducing new teaching methods and modern-
izing production techniques.
Total cost of the project is estimated at US$17.9 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$12.7 million.
Socio-Economic Background
1.03      With 46 inhabitants per km2, Turkey is not densely populated.  Only
one-third of its total area is cultivated. The population of the country
has almost doubled in the last 25 years and is now growing at an annual rate
of 2.8%. Since 1950, migration of the rural population has tripled urban
population which is now growing by 6% p.a. and accounts for 35% of the
total population. Istanbul, Ankara and another half a dozen cities re-
ceive about three-quarters of the rural population outflow. Ankara, with
about one million inhabitants, is the main administrative center but the
Istanbul area, with a population of about three million, is the biggest



- 2 -
center of economic activity in the country. In addition, 14 cities have
populations in excess of 100,000. The rural population is scattered in
36,000 villages of which only 7% are supplied with electricity; many of
them are very small and far from the main transportation arteries. This
makes it difficult to provide equal educational opportunity and modern
amenities for the entire population, a fact which reinforces the flow in-
to the cities. With 41% of the population under the age of 15, the de-
mand for school places is high. Turkish is the spoken language and the
language of instruction in all schools.
1.04      Industry and construction were the faster growing sectors of the
economy in the last five years with industry playing the leading role; they
experienced an annual growth rate of 10% compared to 7.5% for GDP (Annex 1)
despite shortages of technically trained personnel. In agriculture, the low
productivity is shown by the fact that it accounts for only 29% of GDP while
it employs 68% of the total labor force.
1.05      A considerable number of Turks seek employment in Europe and over
400,000 were working abroad at the end of 1970. Besides the difficulties
in adjusting to a different climate and culture, economic fluctuations in
Europe make this solution to the unemployment problem less desirable in the
long run. In the short term, however, the country benefits from workers'
remittances (estimated at about US$250 million in 1970) and from the skills
and industrial discipline that the returning workers may have acquired abroad.
These factors, together with the continuous improvement of the Turks' educa-
tional attainment, are contributing to the development of a modern economy.
1.06      Urban unemployment and rural underemployment augment the economically
dependent population and the demand for social services financed by the govern-
ment. Population growth, urbanization and increased female participation are
increasing the number of job-seekers in urban areas and stress the need for
new employment opportunities. Government is aware of these problems and its
policy is to create new jobs in the non-agricultural sectors of the economy,
especially in industry.
II. THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND EDUCATION FINANCE
Educational Strategy and Recent Developments
2.01      The education system (Appendix I) is undergoing changes necessitated
by developments in the rest of the socio-economic system. While in the
past it met the requirements of the public administration and teaching, the
traditional general academic education is not now adequate for today's ser-
vice and industrial sectors; modern technology and management require employees
to have technical and prevocational background on which to build experience
and on-the-job training.



- 3 -
2.02      With assistance from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), ILO and bilateral sources, Turkey started in the early
1960's to relate its educational and training system to the manpower needs
of its changing economy. Although it has not yet drafted a long-term edu-
cational plan, the State Planning Organization (SPO) and the recently
established planning and coordination department of the Ministry of Educa-
tion have begun to update manpower requirement projections and initiate re-
forms in the education system. The most significant of these changes have
been: (i) revision of primary school curricula; (ii) strengthening of science
streams in secondary education; (iii) initiation of technician schools and
practical trade schools; and (iv) the establishment of new faculties and in-
stitutions to provide instruction in modern technology, science and management.
In September, 1970, the National Convention on Education recommended the in-
troduction of comprehensive secondary schools.
2.03      As in many other developing countries, there has been rapid en-
rollment expansion in recent years. Primary school enrollment (grades 1-5)
has almost doubled in the 1960's to reach nearly five million in 1969, repre-
senting 92% of the age group 7-11. Secondary education has expanded faster
than primary, with enrollments in 1969 representing 32% of the relevant age
group in the case of the lower cycle (grades 6-8) and 16% in the upper cycle
(grades 9-11). During the last four years, enrollment in higher education
was increasing faster (14.5% p.a.) than in any other level of education. En-
rollment targets are set in the five-year economic plans but are usually
exceeded.
General Education and Teacher Training
2.04      The Ministry of Education (Chart 1) exercises a highly centralized
control over policy, curriculum, supervision and teacher appointment; limited
authority is delegated to provincial directors. Private schools are licensed
and supervised by the Ministry of Education and are required to meet the
standards of public schools.
2.05      Primary Education is provided free in public schools.  It starts
at age seven (Chart 2) and is compulsory but, in practice, the law is not
fully enforced. Enrollment (Chart 3 and Annex 2) is increasing quickly and
a 100% enrollment ratio is the target for 1972. RepetitiLon and drop-out
rates are high with less than half of the pupils completiLng the five-year
course without repetition. The curriculum revision in 1962 put emphasis on
mathematics and natural sciences and introduced new teaching methods and
teaching aids in primary schools. The student/teacher ratio has improved
to 42:1, a reasonable standard for developing countries. Teachers are
trained in normal schools in a four-year program (grades 9-12). Consider-
able effort is needed to improve quality, especially in the rural areas
where standards are low.
2.06      Secondary Education has experienced rapid expansion and change.
The lower cycle (grades 6-8) which previously had three streams - general,
vocational, technical - is now changing to a preparatory cycle for grades



9-11, making no provision for those terminating their education at this level.
The upper cycle divides into two streams at Grade 10 - general and science -
and further divides into four streams at Grade 11. Although enrollment in
science courses has been increasing rapidly, a comprehensive type secondary
education would prepare students better for higher studies, employment and
on-the-job training.
2.07      Secondary education also requires quality improvement.  Facilities
and equipment are insufficient for effective teaching. Teachers for secon-
dary schools are trained in three to four year courses in colleges, insti-
tutes and faculties of education. There is a shortage of science and math-
ematics teachers since these graduates prefer well-paid jobs in industry.
The internal efficiency of the system is low in both the lower and upper
cycle; less than 20% of entrants complete the lower cycle without repeating
a class. There is a great disparity in the distribution of schools between
rural and urban areas but the government intends to improve the situation.
Private schools concentrate in the cities and enroll about 4% of the secondary
school students.
2.08      Higher Education is offered in eight public universities and 94
other institutions; 44 of the latter are private and account for one-fourth
of total enrollment. Enrollment has doubled since 1964 and reached 146,000
in 1969. In addition, about 6,000 Turks are studying abroad. In the absence
of a long-term plan, higher education has expanded in an ad hoc manner de-
veloping imbalances and poor quality. The situation is improving as the
Second Five Year Plan emphasizes planned development for higher education
by taking into account manpower requirements; to this end, an inter-university
planning unit has been set up. As intended, the proportion of students fol-
lowing courses in science and technology is increasing (22% in 1968/69) and
the target for 1972 is 36%.
Management Education
2.09      Eight institutions have undergraduate courses in management and
business administration with a combined annual output of about 500. The
Management Development Center of the Turkish Management Association offers
short courses for managers, mainly from the Istanbul area, as well as special
in-plant courses for private and state enterprises. There is at present no
provision for longer-term residential courses for top-level managers.
Technical Education and Vocational Training
2.10      The Ministry of Education is responsible for:  (i) 44 practical
trade schools (post-primary); (ii) 132 trade institutes (grades 9-11); (iii)
37 technician schools (grades 9-12) attached to trade institutes; and (iv)
three technical and commercial teacher training colleges (grades 12-15). In
addition, a number of other institutions offer vocational courses of different
length and orientation. Enrollment in all technical and vocational courses
almost doubled during 1965-1969. This branch of education and training has
undergone some changes during the late 1960's but requires further revision in
structure and quality.



- 5 -
2.11      Practical Trade Schools, established in 1969, enroll about 3,000
youths and adults in fitting, turning, tool and die making, welding, radio
repair and auto mechanics courses. These follow a modular system, each
module providing the skill elements required for a particular Job. The
only entry requirement is completion of primary education. A major weak-
ness is the lack of equipment.
2.12      Trade Institutes (grades 9-11) provide secondary technical educa-
tion. Boys receive training in mechanical, electrical, construction, tex-
tiles and other trades. Girls' institutes offer training in secretarial
work, home economics and other occupations for women. Considerable emphasis
is given to practical work during the courses and about 40% of the output
enter directly into employment in industrial and service sectors.
2.13      Technician Schools, introduced in 1969, fill the gap between pro-
fessional training at university level and skilled worker training. They
operate in 37 Trade Institutes with which they share facilities and equip-
ment. The Institute and the School offer a common first-year program (grade
9) after which students with higher grades in mathematics and sciences fol-
low the technician course (grades 10-12) and the rest a more practical two-year
course (grades 10-11). The curriculum of the technician course lays stress
on practical subjects (40% of the curriculum) but inadequate equipment ad-
versely affects its implementation. Teachers for the practical trade schools
are trained in a two-year course at Izmir. Trade institute teachers are
trained in a four-year course at the Men's Technical Teacher Training Col-
lege. The college is developing a five-year program for teachers for the
technician courses.
Educational Radio and Television
2.14      The Ministry of Education cooperates with the Turkish Radio-Tele-
vision Authority in the production and broadcasting of educational programs.
In addition to seven radio broadcasts a day, two instructional TV programs
per week are transmitted to 60 primary schools in the Ankara area. Along
with the development of the national television system, the Ministry of
Education intends to expand its television instruction to improve the
quality of teaching in schools and promote adult education, particularly
in the rural areas.
Education Finance
2.15      Financial responsibility for education rests primarily with the
central government. No tuition fees are charged. Local communities devote
part of their revenue to education; they accounted for 8% of the cost of
primary education in 1969. The bulk of the public funds for education is
channeled through the Ministry of Education but other government agencies
such as the Ministries of Agriculture, Health and Defense also finance
special educational and training schemes. In 1969, private schools ac-
counted for only 4.5% of total expenditure on education in the country.
Foreign aid to education is minimal and takes the form of technical assis-
tance; it comes mainly from multilateral agencies, Germany and the U.S.A.



-6-
2.16      Public expenditure on education increased from TL2.7 billion in
1965 to an estimated TL4.8 billion in 1970 or, by 12% p.a. (Annex 3) -
almost the same rate of increase as in GNP at current market prices. Since
government revenue was increasing faster (19% p.a.), the share of public
funds devoted to education decreased from 25% to 18% during the period.
Including private schools, total expenditure on education in 1970 accounted
for 3.5% of GNP, a relatively low figure for a country in Turkey's present
stage of development.
2.17      Recurrent public expenditure on education increased during the
last three years by 7% p.a. compared to 13% p.a. for government total re-
current expenditure (Annex 4). Since overall enrollment was expanding by
about 8% p.a. the funds spent on education could not allow for quality im-
provement. Primary education accounted for 47% of total recurrent expend-
iture during the period, secondary general 13%, higher 16%, vocational 10%,
teacher training 6% and administration and other activities 8%. Recurrent
cost per student remained almost constant during the last three years; in
1969 it stood at the low level of US$19 for primary, US$25 for secondary
and US$229 for higher education.
2.18      The Ministry of Public Works administers funds for new school
buildings while the Ministry of Education is responsible for purchase of
furniture and equipment and the maintenance of buildings. Capital expend-
iture on education has increased by 38% since 1967 and averaged 28% of
total expenditure on education during the years 1967-70. During the same
period education accounted for about 9% of total investment expenditure of
the government. Information on the amount spent on equipment and teaching
materials is not available but it seems that the greatest part was spent
on buildings. Since 1967 higher education has increased its share of cap-
ital expenditure from 18% of the total to 34%.
2.19      A recently approved personnel law establishes a standard work-week,
consolidates the remuneration of government employees, and abolishes the
practice of overtime work except in special cases of which teaching is one.
It also provides for considerably higher salaries. The total government
recurrent expenditure in the first year of implementation of the law is
expected to be about 40% higher than budget appropriations and the increase
in total recurrent expenditure on education about 30%.
2.20      The government plans to increase overall enrollment during the
next 5-7 years by about 5% p.a.; the relatively expensive secondary and
higher education will expand faster. It is estimated that recurrent expend-
iture on education will increase by 10% p.a. to reach TL8.3 billion in 1977.
Capital expenditure is estimated to average TL1.8 billion annually in the
coming years; slightly higher than the TL1.5 billion planned for 1968-72.
Thus, by 1977, total annual expenditure on education will be about TL10
billion or 4.3% and 20.5% of the projected GNP and government budgets re-
spectively, reasonable ratios in comparison with international figures.

III. MANPOWER AND EDUCATIONAL NEEDS
General
3.01      The labor force has increased by about 3% p.a. since 1965 and
this rate is expected to continue throughout the seventies. In 1969 about
9 million persons were engaged in agriculture with at least one-tenth either
unemployed or underemployed. New employment opportunities in agriculture will
therefore be limited. A growing industrial sector is all,eviating urban unem-
ployment but population growth, urbanization and increasing female participa-
tion keep the expansion of the urban labor force ahead of the creation of new
jobs. Lack of employment opportunities in Turkey for unslkilled labor and high
wages offered abroad encourage emigration to Western Euroipe and overseas.
3.02      The labor market is not well organized but the labor union move-
ment is gaining momentum. Information on wages and salaries is scanty;
they vary considerably between sectors and occupations. Extensive unemploy-
ment keeps wages for unskilled workers relatively low at about TL15 per day.
Shortage of skilled workers has caused an increase in their wages of about
4-1/2% p.a. in real terms in the last five years; they now range from TL45 to
60 per day.  About one million workers, most of them in the public sector,
enjoy social security benefits.
3.03      Preliminary manpower estimates (in thousands) for the non-agricultural
sectors in 1970 and 1977 are as follows:-

Need for Managers and Administrators
3.04      The growing number and size of private firms require more and bet-
ter qualified managers at all levels. Part of the problems of state enter-
prises is attributed by many observers to the lack of sound management. In
1968 a survey undertaken by the State Planning Organization showed that in
private and state enterprises (excluding agriculture, tourism and services)
only 5% of managers and executives had received any form of management train-
ing.
3.05      At the top level, the supply of managers cannot be easily increased
in the short-run because of the importance of experience in their training.
At the middle level of management and administration, however, formal train-
ing can alleviate shortages. Courses in modern administration of enterprises
provide the necessary background on which managers build experience and on-
the-job training. It is estimated that by 1977 some 17,000 managers should
be trained or retrained in modern management programs; it will be difficult
to achieve this goal since such programs are now inadequate in Turkey, and
residential courses for high level practicing managers do not exist.
Skills for Industry
3.06      In the last five years, industry has been growing at an annual
rate of 10% and this rate is expected to continue in the 1970's. This ex-
pansion generates an increasing demand for skills which the educational system
is ill prepared to satisfy. The gap is filled by employees with less than de-
sirable training, with obvious effects on productivity. Shortages have devel-
oped at all levels of technical skills but they are more acute in the case of
technicians, skilled and semi-skilled workers.
3.07      Shortage of Technicians is developing into a bottleneck.  In 1970
this shortage is estimated at 20,000 industrial technicians and it is expected
to reach 90,000 by 1977, if measures are not taken to increase the supply.
This large increase is a reflection of the need to improve the ratio of tech-
nicians to both professionals and craftsmen. During this period the educa-
tional system should increase the supply by some 15,000 technicians annually.
Technician training was only recently introduced in Turkey and so many tech-
nician jobs are filled by over-qualified engineers or under-qualified crafts-
men with adverse effects on the utilization of skills in the former case and
on productivity in the latter. Rapid expansion of technician training is
handicapped by the shortage of qualified technical teachers; quality improve-
ment suffers from inadequate equipment. Provision for an increased supply of
technical teachers and equipment has been included in the proposed project.
3.08      Skilled Workers or craftsmen are needed in ever increasing numbers
in all sectors of the economy and especially in industry; by 1970 a shortage
of some 390,000 had developed in the non-agricultural sectors and it is ex-
pected to reach 550,000 by 1977. The main source of skilled workers will
continue to be the trade institutes. They graduate about 40,000 annually
but only 16,000 enter in industry and services compared to 70,000 needed.



- 9 -
Lack of practical orientation and aversion of some of their graduates to
"blue-collar" jobs are the more serlous weaknesses of the trade institutes.
3.09      The recently established practical trade schools are expected to
increase the supply and to provide industry with skilled workers more suited
to its needs. The most urgent need is for equipment that will allow them to
implement fully a curriculum with 80% allocated to workshop instruction.
Other training schemes of governmental agencies, on-the-job and other inteLnal
training programs for various industries are expected to fill the gap between
the demand and supply of skilled workers and craftsmen.
Semi-skilled Workers
3.10      Improvement in the productivity of the lower level manpower is
necessary if the growth of the non-agricultural sectors is to be main-
tained. The majority of the almost 120,000 unskilled workers that enter the
non-agricultural sectors annually come from rural areas. Attracted into
the cities by exaggerated hopes for better living, greater employment oppor-
tunities and with almost complete ignorance of the social and psychological
problems they will face in the unfamiliar environment of the city and the
factory, they have low educational attainment, and possess no marketable
skills. There is an urgent need in all the big cities for a training and
orientation center to cater to these rural immigrants, to familiarize them
with modern tools and equipment, to form a source of semi-skilled labor, and
to introduce them to urban life and employment conditions.
Teachers for Technical Subjects
3.11      At all levels of technical training one of the most important weak-
nesses is a shortage of qualified teachers for technical subjects (Annex 5).
The supply is insufficient and highly-paid jobs in industry add to the short-
age by attracting technical teachers. The Men's Technical Teacher Training
College, the only institution of its type in the country, trains technical
teachers in a four-year course (grades 12-15).  It enrolls 1,000 students
and graduates some 200 annually. Enrollment expansion in trade institutes
will require some 2,000 additional technical teachers betwreen 1970-77. En-
rollment projections for the technician schools show that about 800 teachers
of technical subjects will be needed by 1977. The Men's Technical Teacher
Training College is expanding its present program to include a five-year
course to train these teachers.
Need for Science Equipment
3.12      Improvement in the quality of education and especially in science
teaching at all levels has been slow because of inadequate provision of
science equipment and teaching aids. Foreign exchange shortage limits pro-
curement from abroad and the private sector has not commenced producing
equipment and aids domestically. To cope with this problem, the government
established the Science Equipment Production Center which has demonstrated



- 10 -
its ability to produce science equipment of acceptable standards at reason-
able cost. To expand and diversify its production, however, the Center needs
additional equipment and materials, most of them imported.
3.13      While urban schools are large enough to ensure a high utilization
rate and adequate maintenance of expensive science equipment, this does not
apply to the rural schools. In a two-year pilot scheme, it was found that
the best solution is the use of mobile units. They visit the rural schools
regularly and, together with the teachers of the school, teach science, using
the equipment of the unit not available in the school. The unit also repairs
and maintains the equipment of the school and trains the teachers for that
work. With the completion of the pilot scheme, the Center plans to embark
on a large scale use of these mobile units.
Instructional TV for Quality Improvement and Adult Education
3.14      The use of television broadcasting offers an effective way to im-
prove instruction quality, particularly in primary schools and rural areas,
and therefore reduce repetition and "drop-out" rates. Further, there
is a need to expand adult education; if appropriate measures are not taken,
the number of illiterptes will continue to increase. At present, the use of
TV for educational purposes is limited. The government plans to expand the
television network nationwide and this will provide the Ministry of Education
with the opportunity to increase its educational programs. Its Educational
Film, Radio and Television Center, howgever, is insufficiently equipped for
additional program production and for training program producers.
IV. THE PROJECT
General
4.01      The objectives of the proposed project are to improve the quality
of educational programs and assist in meeting well-defined manpower needs
(Chapter III) in growing industrial areas. The project, at a total estimated
cost of US$17.9 million (Annex 6) would include the following new and existing
institutions and technical assistance for the project institutions (Appendix
II).

7. Educational Film, Radio and Television Center: equipment for additional
program production and for training program producers.
*    In addition, a dormitory for 30 servicing staff.
**   The Centers would operate on a double shift basis with a total
enrollment of 3,000; boarding facilities would accomm,odate only half
of the trainees.
The Project Items
4.02      Management Training Institute (paras. 3.04, 3.05).  The project
would establish a new management training institute under the State Planning
Organization, to be located at Gebze, near Istanbul. It would be governed
by a board with representatives from government and business organizations.
The Institute would offer short courses (3 weeks to 3 montlhs) at a post-
experience level, mainly for high-level practicing managers. Emphasis would
be placed on general management and functional management areas such as pro-
duction, marketing, financial control, computer use and personnel management.
The curriculum, however, would be flexible to allow for ad hoc courses on
special management problems of sectors and big firms.
4.03      The capacity of the Institute would be 200 student places and full
boarding is necessary because of the national character of the Institute,
the short length of the courses offered and the need to keep practicing man-



- 12 -
agers away from their daily routine. Some 1,000 managers from all over the
country are expected to attend its courses annually.
4.04      A full-time teaching staff of 15 recruited from among those with
some management teaching experience would be supplemented by visiting speakers
from business, government and university circles and by management consultants.
Twenty fellowships have been included in the proposed project for the 17 full-
time staff and 3 replacements. For development of specific courses, their
curriculum and teaching materials and the initial training of staff, tech-
nical assistance of 5 man-years of management specialists on short-term con-
tracts has also been included. Its proximity to the Scientific and Technical
Research Council Center would allow the Institute to use the computer facil-
ities of the latter; the government has provided assurances that these
facilities will be made available to the Institute after such facilities are
established. The proposed institute has the full support of business organi-
zations and a sufficient number of trainees will be available for enrollment.
4.05      Adult Training Centers (para. 3.10).  Six new adult training cen-
ters, each with a capacity of 240-260 places, are included in the proposed
project. Four would be located in Eskisehir, Izmir, Bursa, Adana and two
in Istanbul, all of which are growing industrial cities receiving a great
part of the rural population outflow. The operation of each center would
be the responsibility of a local committee in which industry and the labor
unions would participate; overall coordination would be provided by the
State Planning Organization. Government is to provide the recurrent expend-
iture but it is hoped that the chambers of commerce and industry will con-
tribute to the recurrent expenditure of the centers.
4.06      These centers would operate on a double-shift basis and offer a
variety of basic-skill training and industrial orientation courses to youths
and adults of an average four months duration. It is estimated that the six
centers would have an enrollment of 3,000 and would train about 10,000 semi-
skilled workers annually. Modest boarding facilities for one-half of the
total number of trainees, most of whom are rural emigrants, are necessary to
accommodate, for a short time, those that are not yet settled in the city
while attending the courses. Full and part-time instructors, provided by
the Ministry of Education and recruited from industry, would receive train-
ing at the Industrial Training Development Center established in Ankara
with UNDP assistance. The government has provided assurances that the Cen-
ter would be expanded and maintained within one year after signing the loan
agreement.
4.07      Technician Schools.  To allow for enrollment expansion and to im-
prove the quality of training, the proposed project would provide additional
equipment to 32 technician schools recently established in growing industrial
centers.  These schools would share facilities with the trade institutes.
Their intake would be selected from trade institute students who have com-
pleted the first year with better achievement in mathematics and science.
Three-year courses would provide technician level training (grades 10-12)
in mechanical, electrical, automotive, electronic or chemical engineering.



- 13 -
A total of 5,500 would be enrolled in 46 streams and about 1,100 would grad-
uate annually (para. 3.07). The government has provided assurances that,
within one year of signing the loan agreement, advisory committees including
representatives from local industries will be established for each techni-
cian school so that the training offered would be more relevant to the needs
of industry; and that, at the national level, an advisory committee with rep-
resentatives from the ministries concerned, state enterprises and chambers
of commerce and industry will be established to advise the Ministry of
Education on matters related to technician and craftsman training. Techni-
cal assistance of three man-years has also been included in the proposed
project to aid curriculum development and the preparation of equipment lists.
4.08      Courses are now instructed by the better-qualif'ied trade institute
teachers but highler quality teaching staff is neede(l. To provide this, the
Men's Technical Teacher Training College will open a 5-year course; addition-
al equipment For the College would form part of the proposed project.
4.09      Practical Trade Schools.  Many of the recently established prac-
tical trade schools for skilled workers and craftsmen lack equipment adequate
to implement their training programs. The proposed project would therefore
provide equipment to twelve of these schools. The twelve schools with a com-
bined capacity of 3,200 would offer day and evening courses and would supply
the economy with about 7,000 skilled workers annually (para. 3.08). Since
the law sets 15 as the minimum age for employment, the government has provid-
ed assurances that within one year after signing the loan agreement, all
practical trade schools will set 14 as the minimum age for admission.
4.10      Men's Technical Teacher Training College (para. 3.11).  Expansion
of the College from its present capacity of 1,000 students to 1,800 would
ensure that qualified teachers would be available for the technician schools
and the trade institutes. The College is introducing a five-year program
for technician school teachers with an enrollment of 300 and annual output
of 50; when in full operation, the College will have a combined annual out-
put of 400 technical teachers compared to 220 at present.
4.11      New facilities for the increased enrollment are under construction,
financed by the government. The proposed project would provide the necessary
equipment for the added student places and improvement in teaching quality.
Since the curriculum for the five-year program had not been finalized at the
time of appraisal, the government has agreed to submit to the Bank a satis-
factory curriculum for this program within one year of siLgning the loan agree-
ment.
4.12       Science Equipment Production Center.  The project would provide
equipment and materials to assist the Center to expand and diversify its
production of science kits, equipment for physics, chemistry and biology
laboratories and other teaching aids for primary and secondary schools. It



- 14 -
would also finance the cost of 10 mobile units to serve the rural schools
(para. 3.13). The Center, a state enterprise, operates on a commercial basis;
its products are of acceptable standards and are produced at competitive
cost. Its prices are, in many cases,, less than half of the c.i.f. cost of
similar imported equipment. One man-year of technical assistance and four
fellowships are provided to modernize production techniques.
4.13      Educational Film, Radio and Television Center.  To assist the
Center in expanding its television broadcasts, the project would provide
equipment necessary for expanding program production and training program
producers, other staff of the Center and teachers participating in the TV
programs. The Center, under the Ministry of Education, plans to expand its
broadcasting to rural schools and adult education schemes (para. 3.14).
4.14      Technical Assistance (Appendix II).  To assist the institutions
of the proposed project in implementing new curricula, introducing new
teaching methods, and modernizing production techniques, the project would
finance the cost of nine man-years of specialists services and 24 man-years
of fellowships abroad. In estimating the technical assistance to be included
in the project, other bilateral or multilateral assistance available to Turkey
has been taken into account. Suitable counterparts would be assigned to all
specialists. The implementation program would be agreed with the government
during the loan negotiations.

4.18      Construction cost estimates are based on unit building costs that
range from US$70 to US$80 per m2 gross area derived from recent contracts and
adjusted to include the expected cost increase caused by devaluation. Site
development is estimated at 12% of building cost. Furniture and equipment
costs are appropriate for the project institutions. Detailed lists would be
prepared during implementation of the project and would be approved by the
Bank before procurement.  The schedules of accommodation reflect high utiliza-
tion and austere standards of construction. Estimated costsg per place for Lile
new project institutions are reasonable; comparisons with unit costs for simi-
lar institutions in other countries are shown in Annex 7.
4.19      The project cost includes a contingency allowance (Annex 8) for
unforeseen factors as follows: 10% of estimated costs for buildings, site
development and professional fees, and 5% for furniture and equipment. The
estimates also include a contingency provision for cost escalation, 8% p.a.
for the local currency component and 5% p.a. for the foreign exchange com-
ponent. All contingencies amount to 16% of the total project cost or 19%
of total cost before contingencies.
4.20      Annual recurrent cost of the project institutions (excluding the
Science Equipment Production Center) is estimated at about TL75 million, less
than 1% of the estimated current expenditure on education in 1977.
V. IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENTS
5.01      Administration-Project Units.  The implementation of the project
would be under a full-time project director, responsible to an Undersecre-
tary of the Ministry of Education, with qualifications and experience ac-
ceptable to the Bank. His major functions would be the financial and admin-
istrative control of the project, communication with the Bank and coordination
of the work of the project unit to be established in the Ministry of Education.
The unit would include, on a full-time basis, a project deputy director, an
architect and a technical educator all with adequate qualifications and ex-
perience; and a qualified accountant, together with adequate supporting staff
and appropriate facilities. Appointment, after consultation with the Bank,
of the director, deputy director, architect and technical educator would be
a condition of effectiveness of the loan. The qualifications and job speci-
fications of specific posts in the unit are set out in Annetx 9.
5.02      Professional Services.  The buildings would be de!signed by archi-
tects of the Ministry of Public Works or by local private consultant archi-
tectural firms. Private architectural firms would be approved by the Bank
and employed on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.



- 18 -
5.03      Construction-Procurement.  Contracts for civil works and procure-
ment of furniture and equipment would conform to Bank guidelines on inter-
national competitive bidding. Invitation to bids for furniture would be
advertised only locally. Bid packages for civil works would be grouped in
such a way as to encourage international competitive bidding as well as to
have the most economical and efficient combination. It is expected that
civil work contracts will be won by local contractors, furniture contracts
by local suppliers, and equipment by foreign manufacturers. Domestic man-
ufacturers of furniture and equipment would be accorded a preferential mar-
gin equal to 15% of the c.i.f. costs of competing imports or the existing
rate of duty, whichever is lower. The implementation of the proposed proj-
ect is expected to be completed in 4 years (Annex 10).
5.04      Land.  All sites have been selected and are acceptable; but three
(two in Istanbul and one in Karabuk) are yet to be acquired. The government
has provided assurances that it would have title to all sites within one
year of signing the loan agreement, or such other later date as agreed be-
tween the government and the Bank.
5.05      Disbursement.  The Bank would disburse or reimburse (i) 100% of
the cost of equipment excluding expenditures on inland transportation; (ii)
100% of foreign expenditures of technical assistance; (iii) 15% of total ex-
penditure for civil works and furniture; (iv) 10% of the fees of consultant
architects; and (v) interest and other charges during construction (Annexes
11 and 12).
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During the loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the follow-
ing principal points:
(i) the availability of computer facilities to the Management
Training Institute (para. 4.04);
(ii)  the expansion of the Industrial Training Development Center
at Ankara (para. 4.06);
(iii)  a national advisory committee to assist the Ministry of
Education on matters related to technician and craftsman
training and local advisory committees for the technician
schools (para. 4.07);
(iv) the minimum age for admission to practical trade schools
(para. 4.09);
(v) the new curriculum for the Men's Technical Teacher Train-
ing College (para. 4.11); and
(vi) acquisition of project schools sites (para. 5.04).



- 19 -
6.02      As a condition of effectiveness of the loan, a project unii- in thl'
Ministry of Education would be established, staffed by a project director,
a deputy project director, an architect and a technical educator, all full-
time and with adequate qualifications and experience. They would be appointed
after consultation with the Bank (para. 5.01).
6.03      The project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$13.5 million to Turkey, for a period of 25 years includling a 10 year
grace period.

APPF.NDIX I
THE MUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
Administration
1.        The Ministry of Education (MOE), the organization of which is
shown in Chart 1, exercises a highly centralized control over policy, cur-
riculum, supervision and teacher appointment.  Little authority is delegated
to the provincial level. Local inspectorates at secondary level do not
exist at present but the government plans to decentralize gradually and es-
tablish a provincial secondary inspectorate system. Responsibility for edu-
cational planning is shared between the State Planning Organization (SPO)
and MOE. Enrollment targets are embodied in the five-year plans and revised
annually in the yearly implementation programs.
2.        Schools belonging to the private educational sector, representing
about 4-1/2% of total educational expenditure, are subject to government
licensing, inspection and supervision. Their standard is expected to be
the same as in the public educational institution; not all have reached it.
Structure
3.        The main features of the education system (Chart 2) are:
(a) primary education of five years (Grades 1-5);
(b) 3-year lower secondary education (Grades 6-8);
(c) 3-year upper secondary education, (Grades 9-11) inI general
and technical streams, and with 4-year courses (Grades 9-12)
in normal and technician schools 1/;
(d) higher education and teacher training from three ([institutes
of education) to six years (medical faculties in tniversities).
University courses are usually of 4-years duration (Grades
12-15); engineering courses require 5 years but are to be
changed to 4 years with the fifth year leading to an M.Sc.
degree.
Primary Education
4.        Enrollments in primary education (Chart 3 and Annex 2) rose from
2,866,500 in 1960-61 to 4,975,000 in 1968-69, or 92% of the age group (7-11).
The 100% target is planned to be reached in 1972.
1/   Grade 12 is, strictly speaking, post-secondary in Turkey.



APPENDIX I
Page 2
5.        The primary school curriculum was revised in 1962 and more emphasis
placed on mathematics and science. Improvement has continued with introduc-
tion of new teaching methods, materials and aids.
6.        The number of primary school teachers increased from 62,526 in
1960-61 to 117,900 in 1968-69, with the average student/teacher ratio re-
duced from 45.8 to 42.0. There are enough primary school inspectors (in-
spector/teacher ratio of 82 in 1968/69) with the necessary qualifications.
Secondary Education
7.        The lower cycle previously provided three streams of study:  general,
vocational and technical. The latter two have been phased out and the main
objective of the lower cycle now is to prepare students for the upper cycle,
with the exception of schools for the training of religious teachers, and
practical trade schools. The reform, although in the right direction in
that it removes too early specialization, would be even better if such subj-
ects as industrial arts and home economics were introduced to cater to
the interests of those students terminating their education after the lower
cycle. The upper cycle lycees provide general education giving access to
the universities. The certificates awarded in the upper cycle vocational
and technical schools, however, give access only to engineering academies,
technical teacher training colleges and equivalent institutions.
8.        Enrollments (Annex 2) in the lower cycle have increased by nearly
300,000 in the last five years, reaching 750,000 in 1968-69, or 32% of the
12-14 age group. In the upper cycle, enrollments including general, tech-
nical and vocational streams, increased from 10% of the 15-17 age group in
1964-65 to about 16% or 326,000 in 1968-69 with enrollment in vocational and
technical streams growing at a faster pace. The average pupil/teacher ratio
is now about 32 to 1 for all secondary education but 42 to 1 for lower cycle
only. Of the secondary level students, 4.3% are in private education.
9.        In the lower cycle, science and mathematics are emphasized but
industrial arts and home economics are not taught. The curriculum prepared
in 1958 had not been changed except in science where the experimental science
disciplines are now taught under one heading. In the upper cycle, science
occupies 44% of the whole curriculum of the science stream for three years
and is also as high as 31% and 19% in grades 10 and 11 respectively for the
literary streams. Except in the science lycee and in 9 pilot lycees, educa-
tion tends to follow the traditional lecture type method of teaching. To
modernize secondary education and make it more responsive to socio-economic
needs, the National Convention on Education held in September/October, 1970
recommended broadening of the upper cycle curriculum and reshaping the
schools into comprehensive types. The recommendation is expected to be
accepted by the government.
10.       Teacher qualification for the lower cycle is three years training
in institutes of education whereas upper cycle teachers are normally trained
at teacher training colleges or at a university.



APPENDIX I
Page 3
11.       The inspectorate is centralized in Ankara with about 100 central
inspectors with the necessary qualifications, i.e., universiLty graduates.
Twenty-one of them are supervising mathematics and science. The academic
subject teacher/inspector ratio is less than 200:1 and the science teacher/
inspector ratio, about 360:1.
Teacher Training
12.       Primary teacher training schools (normal schools)  provide a three-
year course which was recently extended to a 4-year course to include new
subjects, such as health and nutrition, school guidance and evaluation, for-
eign languages and more science. Electives include three choices for practice
teaching: pre-school education, special education as well as adult educa-
tion and community development. In general, the normal schools do not pos-
sess the necessary equipment and materials for effective teacher training,
particularly for practical subjects such as science education and handicrafts.
The total output in 1969 was about 11,500.
13.       The institutes of education train general subjects teachers for the
lower cycle secondary level. Entrance is open to graduates of the primary
teacher training schools and the upper cycle secondary schools. The courses
are of three years duration. The curriculum has changed in recent years due
to modifications in the lower cycle school curriculum but still requires to
be adapted more closely to the new approaches for science education. The
laboratory and workshop facilities are generally insufficient for proper
training. In 1968-69 there were about 4,800 student-teachers, among whom
nearly 42% were future science and mathematics teachers.
14.       Teacher training colleges offer four-year courses to graduates of
the upper cycle secondary schools and normal schools. In 1968-69, 54% of
the 2,314 students in the three colleges were enrolled in the science and
mathematics section. The annual output is about 400, adequate for general
subjects teachers of secondary schools.
15.       The Men's Technical Teacher Training College in Ankara, the only
institution in Turkey for training male technical teachers, offers four-
year courses in: (a) machine tools, (b) sheetmetal, forging and welding,
(c) foundry, (d) pattern-making, (e) automotive mechanics, (f) electric
power, (g) electronics, (h) carpentry, (i) building construction, and (j)
sanitary trades. It also operates in-service training and special courses
for teachers during the vacation period. The college is in the process of
building extensions to accommodate the planned expansion from 1,000 to 1,800
total enrollment. The Women's Technical Teacher Training College and the
Commercial Teacher Training College also supply technical subjects teachers.
The total enrollment of these three Colleges is about 2,000 and the annual
output nearly 400.



APPENDIX I
Page 4
Technical Education
16.       Phasing out of lower cycle secondary technical education was
recently completed but expansion continued at upper cycle secondary level
in trade institutes, girls' institutes, commercial lycees and hotel schools
with enrollment reaching 120,000 in 1968-69. The annual output was nearly
40,000; about 40% join industry and services.
17.       Craftsmen are now trained in 44 practical trade schools (started
in 1969) which work on a module system with each module providing the
minimum necessary skill elements for a job. Admission is at post-primary
level and without age limit but preference is given to boys of about 15
years. Students may proceed from one module to another or go to industry
to work after the completion of any number of modules. Enrollment has
reached 3,000 in 1970. The training manuals and programs of study with 80%
practical work are satisfactory but more equipment is needed.
18.       Training of industrial sub-professional personnel has been
neglected. Technician schools were first started in 1969 in existing trade
institutes in a 4-year course (grades 9-12). They share a common year I at
grade 9 with the 3-year courses in trade institutes but pupils with good
mathematics and science achievement are selected for the technicians 4-year
course. The first group of graduates will leave school in 1972. The cur-
riculum is acceptable; practical work is about 40% of the timetable but the
quality and the attitudes of graduates have not yet been tested. Teachers
would be trained by the Men's Technical Training College in a new 5-year
course. Additional equipment is urgently needed for both the technician
courses and technical teacher training.
19.       Engineers are trained in universities, engineering academies and
abroad. The output from a total enrollment of about 6,600 in 1968-69 was
about 1,200. Not all were absorbed by industry and, for those working in
industry, many are underemployed.
Management Education
20.       In 1954, a Graduate Institute of Business Administration was first
established at Istanbul University with Ford Foundation assistance. At
present, there are four university-sponsored programs of management or
business administration, two including post-graduate work. In Ankara, there
is an institute for public administration. Together with four university-
level academies of economics and commercial science and a number of private
schools, the total annual output is about 500.
21.       The Turkish Management Development Center (MDC) was founded by the
Turkish Management Association (TMA) in 1965 with UNDP/ILO, Ford Foundation
and USAID assistance. It organizes short courses averaging 5 days of 2-3
hour sessions in late afternoons or evenings for practicing managers in
Istanbul and occasionally other cities. Special in-plant courses are also
organized for specific industrial firms and state-owned enterprises. TMA-MDC



APPENDIX I
Page 5
gave 105 courses for 2,444 participants in 1969. It also offers consultancy
services and is virtually self-supporting through fees for this service.
The National Productivity Center at Ankara provides some training but its
major task is applied research. Some Ministries have their own staff train-
ing facilities.
22.       The only residential management course currently available in
Turkey is a 12-week middle management program organized by Istanbul University
for about 35-40 managers, mainly from state enterprises. Private business
considers the course theoretical.  Chambers of Commerce and Industry strongly
advocate the establishment of a new residential management irstitute not tied
to any university.
Education and Training Outside the Formal System
23.       The traditional apprenticeship system of the Guilds was broken
down after the revolution and not replaced. The Law for Vocational Train-
ing in Industry and Mines (1938) required all industrial establishments
with more than 100 workers to set up training programs but, with no facili-
ties for technical advice available to employers, its implementation through
the Ministry of Labor (MOL) was unsuccessful. However, relal:ed part-time
evening courses were organized in 1959 in several trade institutes in coopera-
tion with MOE to improve the quality of workers in industry. About 1,000
workers have attended these courses annually.
24.       The USAID project on industrial training in 1959 revealed the
weakness that employers in general lack clear understanding about indus-
trial training and it therefore concentrated on orienting management towards
training and upgrading needs. After training 633 training directors and
7,731 supervisors, the project terminated in 1967 but 16 MOL advisors con-
tinue to implement programs within enterprises. To arrange iLn-plant part-
time training courses for the improvement of working methods, the ILO pre-
pared with MOL in 1964 a program of assistance in upgrading itraining. The
enterprises provided counterpart/interpreters, classrooms and facilities for
producing lecture materials. Training consisted of some trade theory but
was mainly practical exercises and shop floor demonstrations, while the ex-
perts introduced improvements in the working methods. The number trained
was about 1,000 and, with the multiplier effect of the participants, many
other workers have benefited indirectly from this training. This project
terminated in 1970.
25.       The main target of a law now under preparation is to establish an
efficient system for on-the-job training based on the needs of the labor
market and technological development. A General Directorate of Training in
Industry in MOL will deal with the training policies, training standards and
instructor training. In the draft law, specific principles have been laid
out for in-plant training of workers and apprentices. Training will be car-
ried out according to a pre-established program approved by the new General
Directorate. Employers will be responsible for the establishment of train-



APPENDIX I
Page 6
ing units and for the designation of monitors who will be trained in the
monitor training centers. However, the new law will depend more upon
persuasion than compulsion.
26.       The Government has requested UNDP technical assistance in organ-
izing and developing a national industrial training scheme including the
establishment of an Industrial Training Development Center, which will
assess, on a continuous basis, the country's needs for trained technical
personnel in various trades, develop programs to meet these needs, and
establish training standards. This project would also assist in training
workshop instructors for the six proposed Adult Training Centers. The
request was appraised by a UNDP mission in September, 1970; its conclusions
were positive.
Educational Radio and Television
27.       The Turkish Radio-Television Authority (TRT), an independent organ-
ization, is responsible for all broadcast programs but collaborates with MOE
in the production of educational programs. The Ministry's Department of
Educational Aids and Technical Cooperation supervises the activities of an
Educational Film, Radio and Television Center (EFRTC). The EFRTC's pro-
ducers prepare all the educational television (ETV) program materials and
direct the production of programs at TRT studios; TRT is in charge of tele-
vision engineering operations. TRT has only one television transmitter
(2.5 kw) in Ankara, covering a circle of about 35 km radius but the system
is to be expanded by 1977. In addition to seven radio broadcasts a day,
two ETV programs per week are transmitted to about 60 primary schools in
the Ankara area.
28.       Although the scope of the present experimental ETV operation is
limited, the Ministry intends to expand its ETV production activities for
improving the quality of teaching in schools and promoting adult education
in rural regions. More program producers will therefore be needed in the
future and their training should comnence well in advance of requirements.
