                                     Rural Power Project
                     Implementation Review Mission—September 18-30, 2010
                                     Draft Aide Memoire

1.      A World Bank mission visited the Philippines from September 18-30, 2010, 2010 to conduct an
implementation review of the Rural Power (P066397) (RPP) and Additional Financing for Rural Power
(P113159) (RPP/AF) Projects.1 The Bank team worked with the Department of Energy (DOE),
Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the LGU Guarantee Corporation (LGUGC) and
expresses its deep appreciation to all of the above agencies for their cooperation and hospitality.

2.       Key issues and agreements

        The DOE will keep the World Bank informed, on a regular basis, regarding the resolution of the
         SSMP-1 (Sustainable Solar Market Package) contract which has been cancelled. The mission
         understands that discussions on a settlement between the DOE and the surety/bonding company
         (Phoenix Insurance) are on-going, while DOE in parallel intends to seek the Bank’s “no
         objection? to utilize the GEF grant to rehabilitate the public facility PV installations and train end
         user beneficiaries prior to turnover of the systems.

        The DOE will move forward with technical assistance to update the Missionary Electrification
         Development Plan (MEDP). The Bank team noted that it will be important, given the closing
         date of the GEF grant of Dec. 31, 2011, to undertake the procurement process as efficiently as
         possible. Comments on the revised terms of reference have been provided to DOE by the Bank
         team.

        The Bank’s procurement specialist will conduct procurement post review by mid-October, 2010.

        With the GEF grant closing December 31, 2011, the “winding-up plan? that has been developed
         will be revisited by the DOE Team, and a revised procurement plan prepared and submitted to the
         Bank for review.

        The Bank’s environmental and social specialists will make a field trip with DBP to two selected
         project sites; the site visits will be undertaken before end-November.

        DOE has requested Bank assistance in undertaking a study of possibilities for future, output-
         based approaches to expanding solar home system installations in the Philippines. The DOE and
         the Bank have identified GPOBA (the Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid) as a promising
         source of support to the proposed work, and GPOBA has signaled its interest in funding the
         study. It is understood that GPOBA at this point finances technical assistance and knowledge
         dissemination only, and does not finance connection grants. A draft application and terms of

  The mission was comprised of Alan Townsend (Task Team Leader, Senior Energy Specialist), Victor Dato
(Infrastructure Specialist), Beatriz Arizu (Senior Energy Specialist), Samuel Haile Selassie (Sr. Procurement
Specialist), Maya Gabriela Q. Villaluz (Senior Operations Officer), Victoria Florian S. Lazaro (Operations Officer),
Aisha de Guzman (Financial Management Specialist), and Gia Mendoza (Program Assistant).
           reference is under development, and DOE is preparing an official request letter for submission to
           GPOBA. The contract would be administered by the World Bank, and the consultants would
           work for the DOE.

          The Bank noted the considerable progress that has been made on implementing the pricing
           framework for renewable energy generation. ERC has issued the Feed-In Tariff (FIT) rules, and
           a workshop was held that included ERC, DOE and other agencies to discuss next steps, especially
           with regard to the work of the NREB in calculating the FITs, and also to DOE’s efforts to
           develop the renewable portfolio standard and the installation caps that will apply, by technology,
           to the projects that will qualify for the FITs. There is more work to do and the NREB is targeting
           November 4 for submission of recommended FITs to the ERC, which would then initiate a
           review and consultation process.

          Separately from the RPP work, DOE has requested Bank input related to questions about
           generation supply adequacy; accordingly, the DOE and the Bank agreed that the Bank would
           furnish a short-term consultant to provide some initial advice to Government on this subject. The
           consultant should be fielded in October and November, with the initial phase of work to finish in
           December. It is understood that some questions with regard to supply adequacy can only be
           answered with additional analytic work which will be identified in the course of the initial
           assignment.

 3.        Overall project performance as of June 30, 2010 is summarized here:

 4.       Procurement – There has been relatively little recent procurement activity, though procurement
 is expected to accelerate in coming months. Accordingly, the team agreed that the Bank’s procurement
 specialist would conduct procurement post-review in October, and use the opportunity to also provide
 advice, as necessary, on procurements under preparation. It was also agreed with DOE that, given the
 push to make good use of the GEF resources before closure of that component at the end of 2011, the
 DOE would submit the revised procurement plan to the Bank, for review and “no objection.?

 5.     Environmental and Social Aspects – as the pace of new loan approval at DBP has slowed, there
 were no new environmental and social issues that arose in the course of the mission. It was agreed that
 the Bank’s environmental and social specialists would undertake site visits, one each to a renewable
 energy generation project (which will likely be a mini-hydro) and an electric cooperative network
 investment project.

 6.      Bank loan disbursement: As of September 29, 2010, the cumulative disbursement for the
 additional financing (LN 7673) totaled US$6.89 million (JPY 622 million), representing 17% of the total
 loan amount of US$39.99 million equivalent (JPY 3,572 million). For the original loan (LN 7204), the
 entire amount of US$ 10 million was disbursed by the loan closing date last December 31, 2009.

 7.      GEF grant disbursement: As of September 29, 2010, the cumulative disbursement under the GEF
 grant (TF52188) totaled US$5.79 million or 64% of the total grant amount of US$ 9.0 million. The grant
 closing date is December 31, 2011.

 varies somewhat month to month depending on disconnections and reconnections). The installation of the biomass
 gasifier is awaited.
    a) Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) – All financial monitoring reports were submitted at the
       end of each quarter as required by the loan agreement.

    b) Audited financial statements –The 2009 audited financial statements for the project was
    submitted to the Bank on July 29, 2010 which was past the June 30, 2010 deadline. The
    Commission on Audit (COA) rendered a qualified opinion on the project financial statements
    mainly due to the project’s failure to reflect the residual gain on foreign exchange in the profit
    and loss account contrary to Philippine Accounting Standards (PAS) 21, 39 and the Framework
    for the preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements.

    The 2009 audited financial statements for the entity is still to be submitted to the Bank.


DOE: Compliance with grant covenants

    a) Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) – All financial monitoring reports for 2010 were
       submitted at the end of each quarter as required by the grant agreement. We note however that
       DOE still has to submit a number of financial reports pertaining to the 2010 second quarter FMR.

    b) Audited financial statements –The 2009 audited financial statements for the project was
       submitted to the Bank on August 27, 2010 which was past the June 30, 2010 deadline. The
       Commission on Audit (COA) rendered a qualified opinion on the project financial statements
       mainly due to the following:
         Understatement of the Property, Plant and Equipment Account by PhP 1,435,971
         Understatement of the government equity account by PhP 921,699 due to the double
           recording of payments made to Econ Analysis Norway.

      In addition, the Bank still has to receive a copy of the COA Management Letter including the
      status report on the issues raised by the auditors.

8.       Workshops on PV System Handover to Local Public Authorities – The DOE team is planning
a series of workshops related to handover of solar systems installed as public installations to local
authorities. A significant effort is planned; 13 workshops each targeting clusters of barangays with more
than 100 people to attend each workshop. The Bank team sees these workshops as a high priority item to
ensure a greater likelihood of sustainability in operation of the more than 2,000 systems that have been
installed in public facilities.

9.      Possible Study Tour – DOE has proposed to undertake a study tour (“exposure visit?) focusing
on the PERMER project in Argentina. DOE is advised to ensure 1) value for money; 2) relevance for
participants; and 3) low opportunity costs. The last point is critical – given the time pressure on the
project management staff to initiate new activities, complete on-going ones, and manage other work-in-
progress, it will not make sense to undertake an external study tour unless project implementation issues
are well under control.

10.    Status of Sustainable Solar Market Packages (SSMPs) – The Sustainable Solar Market
Packages were developed as a way to match programmatic money (from Government or from the private
sector) with private sector service providers for installation of PV systems in public facilities and private
households. SSMP packages were bid out. In the case of the pilot, SSMP-1, all four packages were won
by the Solar Electric Company, or Solarco. Two contracts under SSMP-1 had been previously closed,
one because of poor contractor performance while the other under the force majeure provision. The
remaining two contracts, managed by DOE, have now also been terminated. In April 2010, DOE called
the securities posted by Solarco and held by the surety company, Phoenix Insurance. The DOE-PMO is
presently following up the matter with the surety company. DOE is also considering the possibility of
hiring a contractor to renovate the PV installations in public facilities that Solarco installed and train the
end users, as most of them are today non-functional. The proposed contract will cover rehabilitation with
replacement of defective components, commissioning, training and one round of maintenance visits in a
total of 42 barangays, and will be included in the revised procurement plan for the Bank’s review. The
SSMP experience highlights the challenges in sustainability; it also underscores the difficulty in
marketing to private households, as in some SSMP packages, the contractor was faced with trying to
convince households to pay a portion of the PV installation cost while in parallel, in the same area, there
was a Government program installing PV systems at no charge to households.

11.      PV Mainstreaming – Sustainability issues are the key focus of the “PV Mainstreaming? effort.
The DOE’s consultant presented results-to-date of this pilot, which to demonstrate the utility fee-for-
service approach to expanding the market reach of solar home systems. Under the scheme, DOE and its
consultant will attempt to identify 4-6 willing electric cooperatives, and finance the installation of several
hundred PV systems per EC (for an overall target of 2,000). Households would pay the participating EC
for post-installation maintenance services and treat such customers, from the standpoint of repair and
maintenance, on par with network customers. The main point coming out of the presentation was that it
may be difficult to attract as many as 6 cooperatives; while there is some interest in the pilot scheme, so
far only a single EC has taken the step of signing the Memorandum of Agreement. Work will continue
with a target of signing up a full roster of EC’s by February 2011.

12.     Project closure issues – the DOE-PMO is taking proactive steps to ensure the timely closure of
various project components (such as the Market Development Support Facility, and the Incubator
Projects). A revised procurement plan has been drafted, and this will be provided to the Bank for review
and “no objection.? This plan covers some new initiatives, including the handover workshops and
proposed study tour mentioned above. It also includes a significant analytic effort to update the
Missionary Electrification Development Plan, which guides the Government’s efforts to provide power
services in non-electrified areas. The Bank has provided its comments on the proposed terms of
references and now awaits submission of the complete tender package for review. This is an important
consultancy and the Bank emphasized the importance of an efficient tendering process if the activity is to
be completed before the end of the GEF component.

13.      Request for support from GPOBA – complementing the MEDP work, the DOE also decided to
move forward with a request to GPOBA (the Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid) to support work
on subsidy design and regulation related to remote area electrification. This work will be important in
identifying possibilities for scaling up the penetration of solar home systems, and it will also provide
insights on the level of public resources that are likely to be needed given Government’s target of
electrifying over 3-million households by 2017.

Electric Cooperative Distribution Expansion and Efficiency

14.     The pace of new project lending has slowed somewhat, partly as a consequence of private sector
generation investors not being able to move on renewable projects until ERC approves the feed-in tariffs
(FITs). However, the pipeline remains strong and there is excess demand for the resources available
under the project (so in the event that something drops out of the pipeline, there are candidates waiting to
be considered for financing). It is important that DBP monitors progress of specific loans under
preparation very closely, since the project will close at the end of 2012. DBP should also continue to
ensure timely disbursement on already approved loans, and inform the Bank if there are any apparent
delays in sub-projects under implementation.

15.      The team met with DOE and ERC for an update on the implementation of the Renewable Energy
Act. The Feed-in Tariff (FIT) rules were promulgated by ERC on July, 2010. ERC requested the
National Renewable Energy Board to send proposed FIT levels and the allocation cap per RE technology.
The allocation cap establishes a target for capacity additions by technology and has the additional effect
of limiting the exposure of utilities somewhat, because when the cap is reached for a particular
technology, additional renewable projects of that type do not automatically qualify for the FITs (rather
they would need to obtain a sales contract with a utility, or, as applicable, sell the output into the
wholesale spot market). The deadline for submission was extended by ERC until November 4, 2010,
taking into consideration the time required to appoint and/or confirm the members of NREB. DOE is
preparing the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) rules, with USAID grant funding supporting this
activity. The DOE and ERC held a workshop during the week September 20 to discuss and coordinate
the implementation of the feed in tariff (FIT) rules to encompass the RPS rules. RPS rules may be
approved, after the consultation process, by March, 2011.

16.      DOE’s Renewable Energy Management Bureau (REMB) informed the mission that they continue
to receive new applications for renewable energy service contracts (these contracts obligate private sector
sponsors to undertake feasibility studies for specific renewable energy sites, with the private company
having the right to develop the site if the project proves to be viable). Until now, REMB has received
more almost 400 applications, mostly for feasibility studies of renewable sites. A new batch of contracts
has been signed recently, after the appointment of the DOE Secretary. REMB is monitoring progress of
committed work program of RE developers with operational service contracts.

17.     The team also met with ERC to discuss and agree the FY 11 work program covering technical
assistance and capacity building for the development of rules and regulations for renewables.

18.     Preparation of the proposed Philippines Renewable Energy Development project was discussed,
and the importance of mobilizing project preparation grants from the Clean Technology Fund was
highlighted. DBP agreed to advance the process under which the Government will formally request
assistance from the World Bank in mobilizing these funds.

** Additional loan, previously funded under US$10 M APL I.
1/ Computation based on Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines, Consultant & CDM Baseline Construction for The Electricity Grid in the Philippines published by IGES, Japan
2/ Previously released loan amounting to P20.5 Million lodged to APL I. Amount of loan represents unreleased balance to be lodged to APL I additional financing
3/ Kilowatt-hour (KWH) saved is based on the System Loss Reduced from the improvement in the distribution system.
4/ Emission Factor (E.F.) = 0.432 Tons of CO2/MWH for Luzon-Visayas Grid
5/ Emission Factor (E.F.) = 0.280 Tons of CO2/MWH for Mindanao Grid
6/ Emission Factor (E.F.) = 0.475 Tons of CO2/MWH for Luzon Grid
7/ Emission Factor = 0.76 Tons of CO2/MWH, equivalent diesel power plant
8/ The following were considered in the computation of the ERR: 1) FOREX savings on oil import, 2) CER equivalent (assumed at US$5/ton of CO2) and 3) Reduction in Subsidy
   The assumed number of years in the IRR and ERR computations were based on the term of the loan.
9/ Based on the Feasibility Study
Dubai Crude = US$52.15 per barrel (as of 11/14/08)
