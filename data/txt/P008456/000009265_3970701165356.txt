HUNGARY
POWER PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
1.01     The Resource Base. Hungary's energy resources consist mainly of
coal, natural gas and oil. Coal reserves amount to about 715 million tons of
oil equivalent (Mtoe) in relation to annual production of 6.6 Mtoe and consist
of lignite (230 Mtoe), brown coal (275 Mtoe) and black coal (210 Mtoe). With
the exception of the lignite deposits at Biikkibramy and Torony, all coal
basins are being mined. The quality of Hungarian coal is low and presents a
serious constraint to greatly increased production. The calorific value for
lignite is around 6.8 Gigajoules per ton (GJ/t)(1,600 kcal/kg), 12.4 GJ/t
(3,000 kcal/kg) for brown coal and 15.0 GJ/t (3,600 kcal/kg) for black coal,
compared to 27.2 GJ/t (6,500 kcal/kg) for internationally traded steam coal.
All Hungarian coals have high contents of sulphur (2M-4) and ash (201-302).
Although conditions for open pit lignite mining are good, brown coal and black
coal is mined underground under increasingly difficult geological conditions.
1.02     Proven reserves of oil amount to about 20 million tons and of natural
gas to 90 Mtoe, of which 15 Mtoe has a low heat value. Analysis by Bank and
Hungarian National Oil and Gas Trust (OKGT) staff has indicated that there is
an 802 probability that 130 million tons of oil and 325 Mtoe of gas could be
added to the resource base. Domestic production of oil and gas is
insufficient to meet demand, and 74Z of oil and 371 of gas requirements were
imported in 1984, mainly from the USSR.
1.03     Other energy resources are quantitatively insignificant and comprise
hydroelectricity (0.9 Mtoe), low temperature geothermal water (1.3 Mtoe),
firewood (0.6 Mtoe) and agricultural crop residues (0.5 Mtoe). Despite the
limited potential impact on total energy supply of these resources, their
economic exploitation can produce small but valuable savings in imported
energy which the Government is encouraging through its energy rationalization
program. Significant uranium deposits exist in southern Hungary which are
mined for export. Details of energy resources are given in Annex 1.1.
1.04     Energy Sector Institutions.  The energy sector is under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry (IpM). Within the ministry the
National Energy Authority (OEGH), under a deputy minister supervises and
coordinates energy sector activities (Annex 1.2). The main energy supply
enterprises are the Hungarian Electric Power Trust (MVMT), the Hungarian
National Oil and Gas Trust (OKGT), the eight coal mining companies and the
municipalities involved in heat supply.
1.05     A large number of other ministries and Government agencies are also
involved in the formulation of energy policy and the regulation of energy
sector enterprises, and some of the most important are described below. As
part of its mandate for preparing indicative national 5-year and annual plans
and restraining the overall level of investment, the National Planning Office



(OT) has considerable influence over investment levels in the energy
subsectors and in the selection of major projects. It is also responsible for
monitoring project implementation. The National Office for Materials and
Prices (OAM) is responsible for proposing changes in producer and cons er
prices of all fuels and electricity for approval by the Council of Ministera.
Energy prices are formulated in consultation with the economic ministries,
trade unions, political authorities and the energy enterprises. The Ministry
of Finance (PM) regulates taxes and other flows to the state and supervises
the finacing of investments decided at Government level by the State
Development Bank (AEB). Investments initiated and partly fiuanced by the
energy enterprises themselves (which in the case of the power subsector are
usually small) are financed through the National Bank of Hungary (MNB).
1.06     Energy Strategy.  During the 1970's the Government's energy strategy
objectives shifted away from increasing energy supply to meet the needs of a
capital and energy intensive industrial investment program, towards demand
m-nagement to reduce sector investment and restrain energy imports. During
the period 1970-78 abundant supplies of cheap oil and gas from the Soviet
Union encouraged their substitution for domestically produced coal, so that
the share of coal and solid fuels in gross domestic consumption of energy fell
from 532 in 1970 to 31X in 1978. During the same period, annual gross
consumption of energy and energy imports grew at average rates of 4.1X p.a.
and 6.62 p.a. respectively, while energy prices changed little from their
mid-1960's levels. By contrast, domestic production of primary energy
increased at only 1.32 p.a. The power and district heating subsectors became
increasingly dependent on imported hydrocarbons, as major new power stations
and district heating systems were fueled with oil and gas.
1.07     In 1976, the Bucharest formula which set prices of energy (and other
comuodities) traded within the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA)
countries was changed so that prices were set equal to a 5-year moving average
of prices in the convertible area.-' The hope of Hungarian planners that
Hungary could be insulated indefinitely from the increases in world energy
prices was shattered. Following the balance of payments crisis of 1979-80 and
limits to the supply of Soviet oil and gas at concessionary process, the
Government recognized that the economy could sustain neither the level of
investment needed to meet the rapidly growing demand for energy, nor the
associated increase in energy imports. A consensus began to grow that
structural adjustment was required in the energy sector.
1.08     The first element of the new policy was to cut energy investment and
imports by reducing the rate of growth in energy demand. This was achieved
primarily by increased energy prices to consumers other than households and
public services. This measure was supported by a line of credit for energy
rationalization investments, a system of permits for energy consumption,
improved inspection of consumers' facilities and an awareness campaign. The
1/ This has recently been changed to a 3-year moving average of prices,
calculated from prices during the past five years, but excluding the
highest and lowest prices. In addition, crude oil and natural gas imports
above 1981 levels are priced at international prices.



- 3 -
second policy element was to increase, or at least maintain, the production of
domestic energy, especially from coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear power.
1.09     Energy Balance.  The energy sector in Hungary is characterized by the
diversity of fuel use and supply. In addition, there in tight interlinking of
the energy subsectors; power stations supply district heating and process
steam, and coal fired power stations are usually linked to coal mines by
conveyors. In 1984 oil products accounted for the largest share of final
energy consumption (291), followed by natural and manufactured gases (201),
coal, coke, briquettes and other solid fuels (20X), district heat and process
steam (191). and electricity (131). Industry consumed about 46S of energy
(mainly process heat, natural gas, coke and electricity), households a further
291 (primarily oil products. solid fuels, and district heat) and the remaining
251 was consumed by other sectors (agriculture, transport, construction and
services).
1.10     Concerning energy supply, net imports, mainly crude oil, natural gas.
electricity, coking coal and coke, accounted for about 46.51 (13.7 Mtoe) of
gross energy consumption (about 30.3 Mtoe). Production of primary energy
(15.8 Mtoe) (para. 1.13) accounted for most of the remaining balance. Summary
energy balances are shown in Table 1.1, and a detailed energy balance is given
in Annex 1.3.
1.11     Past and Projected Energy Consumption and Supply. The Government's
energy demand management policies, together with the slowdown in economic
growth and a reduction in the share of heavy industry in industrial output,
resulted in the gross consumption of energy remaining almost constant during
the period 1978-84, compared to growing at 4.11 p.a. during the period 1970-78
(see Figure 1.1). Energy intensity - energy consumption per unit of GDP -
declined for most sectors after 1978, particularly for industry where
intensity declined at 3.71 p.a. during the period 1978-84, compared to a
decline of 2.5S p.a. during 1970-78. The consumption of energy decreased in
all sectors during the 1978-84 period with the exception of services and
households. This reflects (a) the growing importance of services in GDP; (b)
household energy prices substantially below economic cost and declining in
real terms until 1985 (see para. 1.17); (c) rising real incomes and higher
standards of housing and comfort; and (d) priority being given to energy
conservation in industry rather than buildings. The overall effect of these
trends was for the GDP elasticity of final energy consumption to be -0.03
during the period 1978-84, compared to 0.70 during 1970-78. The remarkable
turnaround is due to the introduction of effective demand management policies
for the productive sectors; a base of inefficient energy utilization in the
late 1970s; a shift in the structure of industrial output; and mild winters in
the early 1980s.
1.12     For the future, the Government projects energy intensity to continue
declining for sectors other than services and households. Despite this, based
on GDP growth rates in the order of 3.01 to 3.6Z p.a. after 1985, (compared to

Data for 1985-2000 are projections
to be about 0.29 during 1985-90 and 0.23 for 1990-2000. Because of the
increasing reliance on nuclear electricity, gross energy consumption, vhich
includes thermodynamic losses in power generation, would increase at about
1.41 during the period 1985-2000.
1.13     Production of primary energy increased during the 1970's to reach a
peak of nearly 16 Mtoe in 1978. Increases in oil and gas production more than
offset the decline of 221 in coal production. Production declined after 1978
because of financial, geological and manpower constraints in the coal
subsector, and reductions in gas production to absorb gas imports contracted
before the decline in energy consumption. In recent years natural gas
production has been allowed to increase and the first two nuclear units have
been commissioned at Paks so that production of energy in 1984 had almost
recovered to its 1978 level (see Table 1.1 and Figure 1.1). However, despite
investment of Ft 25 billion (US$714 million) out o' total energy sector
investment of Ft 133.1 billion (US$3.8 billion) during 1981-85. (measured at
1981 prices), coal production has fallen short of its targets. The shortfalls
in coal production are of concern to the power subsector, since electricity
generation accounts for about 67% of coal production, and introduce an element
of risk to the project (see para. 4.22).
1.14     The Government projects energy production to increase steadily in the
future so that in the year 2000 it would amount to 23 Mtoe, or 461 above the
1984 level, an annual increase of 2.41. Most of this increase would be
accounted for by nuclear electricity. A further 2x440 MW units are at an
advanced stage of construction at Paks and the Government has decided to
complete additional 4x440 MW units during the 1990's (see paras. 2.16-2.17).
Although it would be possible to maintain oil and gas production near current



-6-
levels until 1990, the Government projects that production would decline
thereafter as reserves are depleted. Further in;estment in coal mining is
projected by the Government to maintain coal production near its current
levels until 1990 and to allow expansion towards the end of the century as the
low cost Bikkibriny lignite deposits are exploited for power generation.
Production of renewables would double but would only amount to 21 of energy
consumption at the end of the century, due to limited biomass resources and
the low quality of geothermal water. Hungary's dependence on imported energy
would decline slightly so that imports would account for 40X of consumption at
the end of the century. The Government's energy balance projections are shown
in Table 1.1.
1.15     Energy Pricing.  Government policy has been to keep the prices of
energy sold to producers (i.e., all consumers other than households and
community services) in line with their economic cost and to gradually phase
out the distortions in consumer prices.
1.16     After being allowed to fall in real terms to levels below their
economic costs, producer energy prices were raised substantially in the mid
1970's and 1980's, and relative prices of fuels were changed (see Annex 1.4).
These increases, together with the falls in international prices in early
1986, have resulted in producer energy prices being above or at economic cost
for all forms of energy with the exceptions of coal and natural gas as a
chemical feedstock.
1.17     Consumer energy prices, with the exception of gasoline, have long
been substantially below their economic costs. In January 1985 the Government
took a bold step and increased consumer energy prices by 30S for petroleum
products; 25S for natural gas, coal and coal products and 16S to 331 for
electricity. As a consequence of these increases and the fall in
international prices, the prices of natural gas and petroleum products are now
at or above economic costs, with the exception of heating oil which is about
871 of its economic cost. Coal prices and electricity tariffs for most
consumers remain substantially below economic cost despite the recent action
by the Government to raise them (Table 1.2).  A consequence of distortions in
the absolute and relative prices of fuels has been a switch from petroleum
fuels to electricity, natural gas and solid fuels and the high growth of
household consumption relative to population and other sectors. Despite the
increases in consumer energy prices in 1985, real prices in 1985 were lower
than in 1970, with the exceptions of gasoline and heating oil (see Annex
1.5).
1.19     The project will support measures to eventually bring electricity
prices more in line with LRMC and increase the producer prices of fuels used
in electricity generation (paras. 2.23-2.24). A gas utilization study is
being carried out under the Petroleum Project (Loan 2398-HU) which will, inter
alia, review natural gas prices in relation to the economic costs of supply.
This study would be an input into a wider energy pricing study which would
assist the Government in implementing and revising its energy price strategy,
particularly in relation to falling energy prices, which immediately affect
only imports at the margin since the decline in the prices of the greater part
of energy imports would be delayed under the Bucharest formula (para 1.07).

Furthermore, in phasing out consumer price subsidies the Government wishes to
place the effect on household incomes and consumption and inflation in its
macroeconomic context and examine the possibilities of those living in public
housing to adjust to higher prices. The Government has agreed to carry out an
energy pricing study under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank by
January 31, 1987. This study would examine the impact of energy prices on the
national budget and the balance of payments, energy demand and investment and
incomes of consumers, with a view to achieving the Government's sector
objectives of energy demand management, conservation and efficient production
and utilization of energy. Thereafter, the Govern-cent would keep producer
energy prices in line with economic costs on the basis of the conclusions and
recoomendations of the study.1L-
1.20     Bank Assistance Strategy and Past Lending.  Bank assistance to
Hungary, agreed with the Government, has been designed to support the
authorities' efforts to implement their program for the structural adjustment
of the economy. Bank lending has had the objectives of: (a) increasing
foreign exchange earnings; (b) reducing foreign expenditures through selective
import substitution; (c) facilitating technology transfer; and (d) promoting
industrial restructuring. Non lending objectives have focussed on project
selection and design, economic and sector policy dialogue, and project related
and EDI training.
1.21     Within the energy sector, the Bank strategy is to support the
Government's objectives of reducing the intensity of energy use and the
economic substitution of domestic energy resources through a switch away from
oil towards coal and to some extent, natural gas. The Industrial Energy
Diversification and Conservation Project (Loan 2317-HU) aimed at achieving
both overall energy savings and the substitution of cheaper fuels for more
expensive oil, and producing these benefits quickly with low investment,
compared to increasing energy supply. The Petroleum Project (Loan 2398-HU)
had the objectives of saving oil and gas imports through maintaining domestic
production; technology transfer; institution strengthening, particularly in
program and project design; and the mobilizing of financial resources,
especially through co-financing.
1.22     Proiect Obiectives and Their Relation to the Sector.  The proposed
project is intended to support the Government's strategy through maintaining
the utilization of domestic coal, potentially saving oil and gas that would
otherwise be used in power generation. The project enables major new power
investments to be delayed through the reconstruction. rehabilitation, marginal
expansion and modernization of coal fired power stations, and the upgrading
and rehabilitation of the transmission and distribution systems. The project
aims to increase availability, reliability, thermal efficiency and useful life
of MVMT facilities, improve the efficiency of existing investment and provide
incremental output at a cost less than investment in new facilities. Such
measures to improve efficiency and reduce investment are at the heart of the
1/ The Government also intends to address the issues of coal production and
r.-icing during the 1986-90 5-Year Plan, taking the complex economic,
financial, geological, technological and sociological aspects into account.

Government's structural adjustment policies. The project also transfers
technology, particularly in power plant monitoring and control, planning and
ma"Agement. It furthers institution building through the rationalization of
the financial and regulatory system applicable to MVMT and the developing of a
capability within MVMT to use modern techniques of power system planning and
pricing. The project would also further improve air quality through the
reduction of particulates emissions. Thus the proposed project is in line
with both the Government's and Bank's objectives and fits well within the
Government's strategy for the development of the energy sector.

II. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
2.01     Overview.  The Hungarian Electric Power Trust (MVMT) is responsible
for public supply of electricity (see Chapter III). In addition, about 560
captive generating units with a total capacity of about 460 MW exist to
provide electricity and, in most cases, steam and hot water for industrial
process heat and space heating. MVMT accounts for 671 of gross electricity
generated, the remainder consists of imports (30%) and captive industrial
plants (3Z). In addition, MVNT power stations satisfy 30Z of industrial heat
and municipal heating systems requirements.
2.02     A thorough review of the subsector was carried out by the Bank in the
Power and Coal Subsector Review (Report 4766-HU). The main issues -n the
subsector (investment strategy, electricity pricing, and the regulatory and
tax system) are summarized below and in Chapter III.
2.03     Consumption of Electricity.  In 1984, industry accounted for 501 of
final electricity consumption, households for 231 (of which 38% was at night,
mainly for space and water heating) services 13X, agriculture and water supply
9X, transport 4X, and construction 11.
2.04     The consumption of electricity has grown faster than the consumption
of total energy. Since 1975, total final consumption of electricity increased
at an average rate of about 4.5S p.a., compared to about 2.0X for total
energy. Although the industrial sector is still she largest consumer of
electricity, its rate of increase in consumption and consumption per unit of
GDP has been declining. Industrial consumption grew at 4.11 p.a. during the
period 1970-75 and only 1.91 p.a. during 1980-84. Consumption by households
and services has been growing rapidly but at declining rates.  During 1970-75
household consumption increased at 11.91 p.a. and services at 16.5Z p.a., and
during 1980-85 the growth rates were 8.91 p.a. and 11.51 p.a. respectively.
Much of the increase in household consumption has been accounted for by
off-peak sales for space and water heating which increased at 17.41 p.a.
during 1980-84, compared to 3.91 p.a. for unrestricted sales. About 40% of
household electricity is used for space and water heating, 151 for
refrigeration, 15% for lighting, 8% for cooling and the remaining 221 for
other uses, including legal household productive activities in the "second
economy". While the shift in the pattern of consumption from industry to
services can be accounted for by changes in the economic structure, the
relatively high growth rates for households are strongly influenced by low
electricity prices (para. 2.21). The overall effect of these trends has been
for electricity consumption per unit of GDP to increase slowly during the
period 1970-84 (Annex 2.1).  Table 2.1 summarizes past and projected
electricity consumption.
2.05     Electricity Demand Forecast.  The forecast of electricity demand was
prepared by the energy sector operating agency of IpM, in consultation with OT
and was reviewed by the Bank during the Investment Review (Report No. 5585-HU)
and project appraisal and found satisfactory. Electricity consumption was
projected using a model of consumption by industrial subsector, other sectors



- it -
and end use. This model contains an input-outpuc macroeconomic model and
takes account of changes to the structure of the economy in detail. It is
based on energy demand models developed at the International Institute of
Applied Systems Analysis in Austria and is similar to the MAED model of the
IAEA.
2.06     During the period 1985-1990, the consumption of electricity in
Hungary is forecast to increase at an average annual rate of 3.3S, compared to
3.71 for the preceding five years. Industrial consumption is forecast to
increase at 1.25S p.a. as a consequence of improved industrial energy
efficiency brought about by economic pricing of energy, supported by other
energy conservation measures, and a shift in the structure of industrial
output away from energy intensive heavy industry. Thus industry's share of
consumption is expected to decline from 502 in 1984 to 45S by the end of the
century. By contrast, the share of households is projected to increase from
231 to 261 over the same period. The maximum demand for electricity is
forecast to increase at 3.5S p.a. during the period 1985-1990, compared to
4.1X p.a. during the period 1980-1985 (from-6,250 MW in 1985 to 7,420 MW in
1990). The demand forecast is shown in Annex 2.4 and snunarized in
Table 2.1
2.07     The growth of electricity consumption in the household sector
accounts for 54S of the increase in consumption during 1985-l90, but much of
this consists of night storage heating. While total residential consumption
would increase at 6.61 p.a. over the period 1985-1990, the unrestricted day
consumption is forecast to increase at only 3.31 p.a. Night electricity is
priced at only 551 of the current marginal cost of supply at night and is
relatively lower in price than oil and gas (Table 1.2). There are already
instances cf the rapid growth of night electricity sales leading to peaks on
branches of local distribution networks. Bringing the night rate in line with
marginal cost, (e.g. by offering only a tariff closer to LRMC for new night
storage installations) would be expet:ted to induce consumers to adopt other
forms of heating when they are availuble or convenient. There would therefore
be a strong possibility that night sales of electricity would not increase as
projected. However, this would ne. affect the requirements for additional
capacity from the project since peak demand would be unaffected. In addition,
the output of the reconstructed power stations would also not change since
the reduction in night load would affect mainly the oil/gas fired plant which
provides marginal supply in the medium term.
2.08     Past Supply. MVMT power stations accounted for 95.5Z of the national
production of electricity in 1984 and 97.01 of production on the
interconnected system. Net imports of electricity, mainly from the Soviet
Union, amounted to 10,269 GWh in 1984, or 301 of the national production of
electricity (excluding use within power stations) of 34,293 GWh. Imports,
which amounted to only 201 in 1970, have accounted for a growing share of
electricity supply. The increase in imports is related to the completion of a
750 kV interconnection with the Soviet Union in 1978 and Hungarian
participation in the Chmelnitsky 4xl,000 MW nuclear power station in the
Ukraine (USSR). Hungary purchases electricity from the USSR under several
arrangements ranging from agreements for emergency support in event of plant
failure to contracts for supply into the next century. Hungary is
interconnected with all other neighboring countries and trades electricity
seasonally, particularly with systems having a high proportion of hydro
plant.

2.09     At the end of 1984, installed capacity available to the
interconnected system within Hungary was 6,145 MW. With average December
working day peak imports of 1,485 MW, this enabled a margin of 31% over the
measured 1984 peak demand of 5,833 MW (Annex 2.3).

2.10     There has been a long term trend away from coal to other fuels;
first, towards oil until the mid 1970s, then to natural gas and finally to
nuclear energy during the past two years. The share of coal in MVMT fuel
consumption fell from 982 in 1955, to 822 in 1965 and to 46Z in 1984; oil
increased from 13S in 1965 to 242 in 1975 and decreased to 122 in 1984;
natural gas increased from 62 in 1965 to 312 in 1984; and nuclear material
accounted for the remaiuing 112 of the 1984 fuel consumption.
2.11     Supply Facilities.  MVMT's installed generating capacity (6,012 MW),
comprised steam plant (4,882 MW), two nuclear units (880 MW), three gas
turbines (202 MW) and a number of small hydro units (48 MW) (Annex 2.5). The
steam plant consists of two major stations fuelled by heavy fuel oil and
natural gas (Dunamenti 1,870 MW and Tisza 860 MW), one lignite fired plant
(Gagarin 800 MW), and a number of much smaller coal fired stations. The
Dunamenti, Tisza and Gagarin stations have units of 200-215 MW, while the
other stations have small units, of which more than 202 are over 20 years
old. Development of generating capacity is shown in Annexes 2.6 and 2.7.
2.12     The backbone of the Hungarian transmission and distribution system is
a 400 kV network which was commissioned during the 1970's. Secondary voltage
levels for transmission are 220 kV and 120 kV. Primary distribution voltages
are 20 kV and 10 kV and the low-voltage distribution is 400 V three phases, 50
Hz for the entire country. In 1978, a 750 kV interconnection with the Soviet
Union was commissioned which has a length of 481 km between the terminal
substations in the two countries. MVMT has a modern dispatch center in
Budapest which uses state of the art computer technology to control generating
unit output, maintain the reliability of the transmission system and control
electricity trade.
2.13     Development of the HV system (voltages greater than 120 kV) appears
to have kept pace with the growth in system demand (Annex 2.8). However,
shortages of finance have constrained investment in MV and LV distribution.
System losses for all Hungary (excluding electricity consumed within power
stations) were 9.81 in 1984, compared to 8.61 in 1975. System losses appear
low because roughly 602 of electricity is sold at MV and HV where losses are
inherently low. However, losses in supplying LV consumers are in the order of
142. MVMT through its rehabilitation program of the distribution system,
partly financed by the proposed project, is aiming to reduce losses through
network reinforcement and maintenance upgrading.
2.14     Proiected Electricity Supply and Power Generation Investment
Program. The third and fourth 440 MW nuclear units at Pak3 are the main
project currently under implementation. These units are planned to be
commissioned in 1986 and 1987, thus completing the first phase of the Paks
station. In addition, there are several reconstruction projects under
implementation (see Chapter IV).
2.15     Future options for power generation to meet the forecast demand in
the early 1990s include a 4x440 MW extension to the Paks nuclear plant, a
8x250MW lignite station at Biikkabrany and the joint 880 MW Czechoslovakia -
Hungary Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric plant on the Danub-.. Net
electricity imports are planned to stabilize for about 10 ye.rs at 10,400 GWh
(302 of supply in 1985) then decline to about 212 at the end of the century.
Additional imports have been ruled out by Hungarian planners b:-sause: (a)



- 14 -
supply would be from Soviet nuclear plant at a similar cost to generation in
Hungary; (b) line losses would increase this cost; and (c) the need for spare
transfer capacity would necessitate reinforcement of the 750 kV
interconnection.
2.16     Investment options for the l990's were analysed by the Bank in the
Power and Coal Subsector Review (Report No. 4746b-HU) which concluded that a
8x250 MW lignite fired power station near Biikkibrany was preferred to a
nuclear station of the Soviet type VVER 1,000 MW which is to be the CMEA
standard design for the 1990's. Since that study was carried out, the
Government decided that the 1,000 MW nuclear unit was inappropriate at present
for technical and economic reasons, and re-examined another nuclear option
consisting of a further 4x440 MW VVER nuclear units at the Paks station. In
addition, tighter environmental restrictions would now require flue gas
desulphurization at the Bukkabrany station, thus adding to the cost of the
lignite option. According to the Government's calculations, the 440 MW
nuclear and lignite options are of equal economic merit. Without doing
exhaustive studies it is difficult for the Bank to verify this conclusion
since: (a) it is difficult to establish the cost to the economy of nuclear
components imported under CMEA barter arrangements; (b) there is considerable
uncertainty about the construction time of the nuclear option (the first Paks
unit took 10 years to build, while the fourth is expected to take about six
years); (c) the availability of the 440 MW nuclear units is about 70X in
Hungary and abroad, compared to a worldwide average of about 60X for 1,000 MW
nuclear units; (d) recent operating experience at the existing Gagarin plant
suggests that the availability of the Buikkabrany plant might be lower than
that used in the planning studies; and (e) there are methodological
differences between the analyses used by the Government and the Bank (an issue
that will be addressed in the technical assistance component of the Project).
2.17     Although the Government has tentatively decided on the 440 MW nuclear
option, the lignite option has not yet been ruled out since the following
issues associated with the nuclear option need to be resolved: (a) changes to
the design to meet current safety standards; (b) the earthquake resistance of
the basic design; and (c) the unwillingness of the Soviet Union to be the
prime contractor and to supply certain components, since it has standardized
on the 1,000 MW design. Furthermore, there is an aspect of international
relations in the decision since the nuclear industry is held to be a
successful example of CMEA economic integration and CMEA countries have agreed
on a high nuclear strategy in the power subsector.
2.18     The Government has decided to implement the Nagymaros-Gabcikovo
multipurpose hydro project which would be completed in stages by about 1994.
The original contract was signed in 1977 and re-affirmed in 1983 after civil
works had been halted because of the need to scale down investment. The
project would cost Hungary about Ft 50 billion (US$1 billion). Power
production would be about 880 MW which would be shared equally between the two
countries; Hungary would receive 1,900 GWh annually.
2.19     In view of the magnitude of power investments and the complexity of
investment decisions, there is a need to strengthen MVMT's planning capability
so that decision makers in Government are presented with investment proposals
that are based soundly on economic principles and take accont of the risks of



- 15 -
alternative options. To strengthen the role of MVMT in planning and
investment decisions. MNUMT agreed to: (a) carry out a least cost power
investment study under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank by June 30,
1987; (b) after exchanging views with the Bank on the study prepare a least
cost investment strategy by December 31, 1987; (c) annually review and update
this strategy; and (d) recommend to the Government only alternative investment
programs that are in accordance with this strategy. For its part, the
Government has agreed that the future development of power generation would be
in accordance with any one or more of the alternative investment programs
prepared by MVMT. The technical assistance component of the project would
contain provision for strengthening MVMT's planning capability, through
training, expert assistance and acquisition of computer hardware and
software.
2.20     Electricity Pricing.  Electricity tariffs for industry and other
producers are on average about 1341 of long run marginal cost (LRMC) (Table
2.2). The tariff structure has time of day kWh prices and charges for
subscribed maximum demand in system peak and other periods (Annex 2.9). This
structure is broadly in accord with the structure of LRMC and provides strong
signals to shift consumption to off-peak periods.
2.21     Household electricity tariffs are differentiated by location with the
lowest price in Budapest at a flat rate of Ft 1.00/kWh (UScents 2.2/kWh) and
the highest in villages at Ft 2.20/kWh (UScents 5.9/kWh)(Annex 2.9). Regional
differences of this magnitude are justified by the Government not on cost
grounds but in order to meet the basic needs for electricity of poorer
families in cities. In addition there is a night rate of Ft 0.70/kw (UScents
1.6/kWh) which is about 55S of LRMC (the cost of fuel oil adjusted for
conversion, transmission and distribution losses).L'  Some of the decline up
to 1984 in the average real price of household electricity is due to faster
growth in night sales depressing the average price. Electricity expenditure
in 1983 ranged from 1.3X of total expenditure in two income and white collar
households to 1.82 for the economically inactive. Total expenditure on energy
was 4.0Z and 6.8% respectively.  The energy price increases of January 1985
may have raised these proportions, but they probably remain lower than in
Western Europe.
2.22     LRMCs are calculated in Annex 2.10 on the basis of the incremental
costs of generation from the lOx200 MW oil and gas fired units at the
Dunamenti and Tisza power stations which provide marginal supply at all times
of the day and year. The calculation assumes that insufficient natural gas ij
available to meet the incremental demand so that the marginal fuel cost
delivered to the system of US$21.7/MWh is related to the costs of operating
these units an residual fuel oil at a c.i.f. price of Ft ll0/GJ (US$93/t).
1/ Because of the rapid growth of night consumption, there is a possibility
that peaks will occur on branches of local distribution networks during
the night, in which case the LRMC would be higher.

2.23     Government policy is for electricity tariffs to fully reflect LRMC.
The main issues are the pace at which it is possible to raise consumer tariffs
to LRMC and the appropriate pricing policy for producer tariffs when oil
prices are falling. In order to prepare a timetable for restructuring tariffs
in line with LRMCs, it is necessary first to obtain firm estimates of LRMC by
tariff category that take account of detailed information available on
consumer load characteristics, international oil prices and the fuel supply
costs that will result from the current round of CMEA negotiations for the
1986-90 Five-Year Plan. MVMT agreed to initiate a LRMC tariff study under
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank by January 31, 1987 and complete
the study and submit it to the Bank for review by December 31, 1987.
2.24     Until the LRMC electricity tariff study and the other energy pricing
studies (para. 1.19) are completed, it would be necessary to set average



- 17 -
tariff levels to meet the financial targets outlined in para. 5.20. The
financial targets were set so as to promote financial autonomy for MVMT,
reduce its dependence on the State budget and to ensure that tariffs on
average remain close to LRMC. The financial targets imply that if the
producer prices of electricity are maintained at parity with LRMC then
consumer electricity prices would remain on average, about 601 of LRMC.
Because LRMC would increase during the period 1986-95, mainly because of
higher fuel prices, average consumer electricity prices would need to increase
by about 9S each year in real terms. This rate of adjustment would be
reasonable since most families live in publicly owned apartment buildings and
have limited opportunities for changing their pattern of fuel use, and the
Government wishes to avoid a precipitous decline in living standards. MVMT
and the Government are examining a number of measures affecting consumer
prices which would provide incentives to consumers for rationalizing
electricity consumption while enabling households to afford minimum standards
of heat and light. Measures being examined include a tariff with a high price
for consumption above a minimum level, supplying new consumers of night
electricity at a tariff close to LRMC, higher connection charges for new
unrestricted or night consumers and reducing regional price variations. Since
the marginal price would apply to incremental consumption and second economy
activities, most of the efficiency objectives of LRMC pricing would be
achieved, while at the same time safeguarding low income households locked
into a pattern of energy use outside their control.

III. THE HUNGARIAN ELECTRIC POWER TRUST
3.01     Organization.  MVMT, which would be the beneficiary of the loan,
comprises 22 member enterprises; 11 power stations, a power station
maintenance company, a national transmission company, six distribution
companies, and three companies for finance of investment, civil engineering,
and erection of power station equipment (Annex 3.1). Under the Electricity
Act of 1962, MVMT has the responsibility for ensuring an adequate and
continuous supply of electricity at a satisfactory standard of service.
3.02     MVNT is under a general manager, who is appointed by IpM.  Until
recently, IpM also appointed the two deputy general managers, but since 1983
the general manager has the right to appoint them. The general manager is
advised by a board of directors comprising the deputy general managers, the
directors of the member enterprises, representatives of the power industry
trade union, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and MUNT's employees.
MVMT's organization chart is shown in Annex 3.2.
3.03     Like all state enterprises, MRMT is subject to state supervision and
control, in accordance with the law on state enterprises. As the supervising
ministry for the subsector, IpM, through the OEGH, is responsible for ensuring
that MVMRT and its enterprises are operated in accordance with the objectives
of the national ener.y policy. All major investment plans and investment
proposals have to be submitted to IpM, the National Planning Office and the
Ministry of Finance for approval. The latter channels finance for State
investments to MVNT through AFB. The actual preparation of these investment
proposals rests mainly with outside engineering, consulting and research
institutions, EROTERV, EGI, VEIKI and the operating arm of IpM, AEEF.
3.04     According to the law on state enterprises, the member enterprises of
MVUT are supposed to have a large measure of autonomy and control over their
own affairs, particularly as regards investment, technological development,
employment policy, pricing, sales and procurement, organization and financial
and commercial arrangements. Directors of meer enterprises are appointed by
the general manager of MVMT. In an attempt to give them more freedom of
action, they have recently been given the right to appoint their own deputy
directors and greater freedom to determine wages and salaries (within the
nationally prescribed scales) and award bonuses as incentives to efficiency.
Nevertheless, the enterprises function essentially not as independent
companies, but as operating units of MVMT. They are well organized and
managed with competent and well qualified staff.
3.05     Manpower Planning and Training.  MVRT and its member enterprises have
72 training workshops for skilled workers throughout the country, and provide
specialized training for skilled workers with the necessary aptitude and
experience to become technicians. Twenty-two of the specialized secondary
schools in the national educational system provide special classes in subjects
specifically related to electricity supply. Overall the existing training
facilities are satisfactory. However, weaknesses have been identified in the
areas of planning and management, and would be addressed under the technical
assistance component of the proposed project (paras. 4.01 and 4.03).



- 19 -
3.06     Regulatory Framework. The organizational structure of MVMT has been
shaped to transfer activities that would normally fall within the realm of a
power utility to outside entities. The most striking example of this is in
the area of planning. In effect, while MVNT is fully equipped with human
resources to assume the full range of a power utility's operations, its role
has been reduced to that of producing and distributing electricity with little
say in the formulation of investment decisions or sector strategy. However,
this will change since it has been agreed that MVMT would prepare a least cost
investment strategy, with assistance made under the project (para. 2.19).
3.07     Hungary has embarked on a course of economic reforms based on the
philosophy that efficient allocation of resources is best achieved through
decentralization of decision-making by increasing the responsibility of
enterprise managers for both production and investment decisions. Reforms in
the investment decision process, pricing system, subsidies, wage and labor
regulations, taxation, managerial incentives and investment financing are
being introduced in the competitive sector at a very rapid pace. By contrast,
to date these changes have had a limited effect on MVMT.
3.08     Managerial Incentives.  A review of public investment in Hungary
concluded that, in general, State intervention in enterprise decision-making
has been pervasive and bureaucratic in character and promoted a risk - averse
attitude in enterprise managers. Another finding of the report was that
basing the managers' financial rewards and career advancement on the size of
their operation rather than profitability may have induced managers to seek
greater concentration of operations without due regard to efficiency. In a
situation where strategic decisions are taken outside the enterprise
(investment decisions, setting of financial policy, Government ad hoc measures
to withdraw funds from the company, pricing policy), there is little incentive
to assume risks, or for enterprise managers to pay greater attention to
profitability and efficiency.
3.09     In theory, these conclusions would be also valid for MVMI where the
general manager is under the tight controls exercised by supervising
ministries." The autonomy which MVMI is supposed to enjoy is strictly
circumscribed in practice. In particular, despite its responsibility under
the electricity law for ensuring an adequate and reliable supply of
electricity, in the key areas of load forecasting and system planning and
pricing, the lead is taken by IpM, OT and OAA.
3.10     It would be desirable to introduce clearly monitorable performance
indicators for MVMT and to limit the level of government intervention to only
key sector decisions, leaving more autonomy to MVMT' management. The
financial policy and planning measures under the proposed project were
formulated with this objective in mind (paras. 2.19 and 5.19-5.20).
1/ The management information system now in place has been designed primarily
to comply with reporting requirements of the many controlling bodies.

3.11     Wage Regulations and Labor Allocation.  In Hungary, the overall cost
of labor as an input is difficult to quantify; compared to other Bank member
countries the base salary is a smaller fraction of worker's income and is
supplemented by all kinds of fringe benefits (non-cash beneftts paid out of
the employer's Welfare and Culture Funds, such as food and recreational
subsidies) and substantial subsidies on most consumer's goods. However, a
comparison with manning levels prevailing in enterprises of similar size and
configuration within the same industrial branch can be made.  The Power and
Coal Subsector Review showed that there may be over-manning at MVMT power
stations compared to similar utilities in Western Europe.
3.12     The two factors contributing most to MVMT's above average employment
ratio are common to most Hungarian state enterprises: (a) an inefficient
workers' incentive system that has led to seemingly low direct cost of labor;
and (b) a system that deprives managers of responsibility for personnel
matters. The undesirable outcome is an inefficient use of labor.
3.13     The reward system that has prevailed until now has tended to penalize
superior performers since every MVMT employee is guaranteed a minimum reward
irrespective of his performance, while the Government puts a ceiling on the
total increase in the annual wage bill. These are some of the negative side
effects of a system where employment matters were overwhelmingly controlled by
workers' councils,1' and the Government's main concern in setting basic wage
levels and permissible wage increases has been to control purchasing power and
income differentials.
3.14     The Government is in the process of giving a freer hand to enterprise
managers in the competitive sectors to deal with employment matters with the
aim of eventually reducing redundant labor and redeploying it in sectors that
are supply constrained. Under this proposal, workers would be induced to
raise their productivity since their earnings would be predominantly
determined by the enterprise's profitability. MVMT has not been included in
these proposals, and its salary structure is still and will likely remain
centrally controlled. But even within this framework, a number of steps could
be taken to increase labor productivity, such as giving preeminence to MVMT
management over the workers council in making personnel decisions, awarding
higher bonuses to, and promoting better career prospects for outstanding
performers, and giving management the right to dismiss incompetent staff.
3.15     Taxation.  Until the end of 1984, the main features of the Hungarian
tax system were: (a) centralization of enterprise profits through an extremely
high level of enterprise taxation; (b) transfer of funds corresponding to a
substantial portion of annual depreciation to the state; and (c) regulation of
the use of enterprise funds through the creation of specific reserve accounts
with rigid delimitation of the utilization of the corresponding assets. Since
personal income tax and sales taxes were low. these profits and funds
constituted the main resources for the Government budget that were then
1/ Under the present system, it is virtually impossible for an enterprise
manager to fire an employee (even though he has the right in theory),
hence the security of tenure is as guaranteed as in the civil service.



- 21 -
reallocated to enterprises in the form of investment and operating subsidies.
This taxation system was an additional instrument that the Government used to
constrain enterprise autonomy over investment decisions, more recently as a
means of macroeconomic stabilization. Under the system, 401 of depreciation
was paid to the state budget, 20S of after tax profits had to be paid into a
Compulsory Reserve Fund largely unavailable to the enterprise. Of the
remaining profits, the enterprise was required to constitute a Development
Fund which, combined with the 60S of depreciation that stayed within the
enterprise constituted the resources internal to the enterprise for covering
debt service, working capital and planned investment requirements subject to
an investment levy and construction tax. Any remaining profits could be
placed into: (a) a Profit Sharing Fund whose size and distribution to workers
was regulated by a progressive taxw' on earnings, and (b) a Voluntary Profit
Reserve Fund to be taxed when used.
3.16     This tax system left enterprise managers with little leeway to
initiate investments other than those formulated and approved by the State,
rendered enterprises dependent on government resources and most importantly
greatly reduced enterprise accountability. Also by focusing mostly on
controlling investment, not enough emphasis was placed on improving the
efficiency of existing operations through cost savings, for which there may be
great scope.
3.17     The Government is making a genuine attempt to liberalize the economy,
and decentralize decisions. A number of changes in the taxation system have
already been introduced in 1985 and further modifications are targeted for
1986. The essence of these changes consists of: (a) the reduction in the
number of separate, obligatory transfers into special funds; (b) retention of
the full depreciation within the enterprise; (c) lowering the tax on profits
from 451 back to 40X; (d) assessing the municipal tax on the wage bill instead
of on profits; (e) greater discretionary uses of resources for investment
subject to an accumulation tax of 18S that replaces an investment levy and
construction tax; (f) distribution of profits to employees (subject to the
payment of the tax mentioned in para. 3.15); and (g) acquisition of financial
assets (bonds). These changes seek to encourage enterprise profit orientation
by making taxation more predictable-' and allowing enterprises more options
in the uses of their resources.
3.18     These reforms apply to enterprises operating in the competitive
sector, but were applied only partly to MVMT. This is particularly true of
the producer differential turnover tax, which for the competitive sector is to
decrease in line with the liberalization of price policy, but remains in full
force in the case of MVMT.'' The formula for calculating this tax is not
1/ Tax on the profit sharing distribution is as follows: zero (exemption)
for the profit sharing distribution up to 2Z of wages, 100% for the second
21 and 600Z for amounts above 4% of wages.
2/ To date, there has been no consistent pattern of taxation over time, its
annual determination was the result of intensive bargaining between
enterprises and the Ministry of Finance.
3/  This tax is intended to make domestic prices equal to international prices
in convertible currency markets.



- 22 -
specified in the case of MVMT, its amount, subject to negotiation each year
cannot be predicted and it has been used as a tool to take away from MVMT all
funds that are considered excessive. Other features of MVMT' £ tax system
were: (a) the exemption from the wealth tax (32 of previous year's assets);
and (b) an accumulation tax of 181 of enterprise initiated investments and
increments in working capital which does not apply to state initiated or
approved investments. The accumulation tax, which applies to all enterorises,
has encouraged MVMT to replace ageing assets with investments of identical
size, where in some instances, it would have been more economical to opt for a
different size, and may have induced enterprises to neglect maintenance. The
Government has given assurances, satisfactory to the Bank, that MVMTI tax
regime has been changed such that: (a) similar to the competitive sectGr, MVMT
would be charged the accumulation tax only in respect of investments decided
Dy the company; (b) MVMT's specific producer turnover tax would be abolished;
(c) MVMT will be charged with a tax on profits at the same level as the
competitive sector; and (d) MVMT would continue to be exempt from the wealth
tax.  This tax regime is now almost equivalent to the competitive sector, with
the exception of the wealth tax which is inappropriate for a public utility
with major investments decided by the Government. MVMT taxes are now more
predictable, enhancing the autonomy of the company in its financial affairs.
The Government is aware of the distortions induced by the accumulation tax,
which has been levied as a macroeconomic stabilization measure, and this tax
would be reviewed in the continuing process of economic reform.
3.19     Investment Financing.  Currently, Hungarian planners distinguish
between three investment categories in deciding on investments and sources of
financing. These are:
(a) State Investments: This category includes projects which dominate
the branches in which they occur or whose costs exceed Ft 500
million. In the power subsector, this category is concerned
exclusively with the construction of new power plants. The
decision-making process for state investment is vested in the State
Planning Comzittee, a committee of the Council of Ministers that
requires an opinion on the investment proposal from authorities
concerned with the decision (PM, Min'.try of Foreign Trade, MNB, OT,
OAA and the local municipality). Under the proposed economic
reforms, only investments in erergy and infrastructure will be left
in this category;
(b) Target-Grouped Investments: This category includes projects that are
individually small coapared to State Investments and whose project
implementation is less than 36 months, but which require State
coordination. In the power subsector, the power transmission and
distribution network falls into this category. The decision making
process for this category is shorter than for State investment and
rests mainly with the supervising ministry, i.e., IpM in the case of
MVMT; and
(c) Enterprise Investments: This category includes investments that do
not fit within the other two. Concerning power, this comprises
mainly reconstruction, rehabilitation and maintenance projects, and
office buildings and equipment.

3.20     Patterns of Investment Financing.  Up till now, State and target
grouped investments were financed from a combination of State grants and
government loans both of which were channeled through the AFB.-  The AFB
acts essentially as a window of the PM. Even though it is nominally a bank.
its banking functions in the traditional sense have been rather limited.
Banking reforms under consideration would ascribe an active role to AFB in the
financial intermediation process.
1/ Sources of funds for AEB loans exclusively have consisted of refinancing
from MNB, while investment grants were provided by the Ministry of Finance.

IV. THE PROJECT
4.01     Objective and Scope.  The objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a) support the Government's strategy aiming at increasing the share of
indigenous coal in Hungary's primary energy consumption, thus potentially
saving more expensive imported oil and gas; (b) assist MVMT in conserving
scarce investment capital through delaying major new nuclear and lignite
investments; (c) strengthen MVMT's institution building efforts; (d) reduce
atmospheric pollution; and (e) assist in the transfer of modern technology.
To achieve these objectives the proposed project has been designed to assist
MVMT in: (a) improving the firing conditions of poor quality domestic coal
used for power generation; (b) reconstructing, upgrading and rehabilitating
existing coal-fired power plants, and upgrading and rehabilitating its
transmission and distribution systems; (c) acquiring modern means and
techniques in investment and system planning, system operati%n, monitoring and
control, economic pricing, financial management, management information
systems and training; and (d) improving environmental monitoring and control,
including the rehabilitation and/or replacement of electrostatic precipitators
and the installation of desulfurizing units.  In addition, the pr-?osed
project would be a vehicle for the transfer of modern technology by providing
the opportunity to local manufacturers holding western licenses for machinery
to modernize and improve the designs of boilers and turbogenerators they
manufacture.
4.02     When successfully completed, the proposed project should enable MVHT
to use the low quality of domestic coal supplied to the power plants while
producing operational economies in power generation and heat supply, increase
the output, availability, reliability, and life expectancy of existing
coal-fired power plants and transmission and distribution systems, reduce
particulates emission, and improve its planning, managerial and training
capabilities.
4.03     Project Description.  In 1978 MVMT began a large program of
reconstructing in stages 12 existing coal-fired power plants, and upgrading
and rehabilitating the generation, transmission and distribution systems. The
reconstruction program is expe:ted to be completed by 1994 while the upgrading
and rehabilitation program would be a continuous effort aimed at maintaining
the systems in good operating condition. By June 1985 four power stations had
been reconstructed and work was either ongoing or scheduled to start in the
remaining eight plants. Thus the proposed project is a 7-year (1986-1992)
time-slice of MVMI's 1986-1994 reconstruction, upgrading and rehabilitation
program and includes the following three components:
(a)  Reconstruction.  Reconstruction of the power stations of Gagarin,
Ajka, Borsod, Pecs, Tiszapalkon, Oroszlany, November 7, and Tatabanya
consisting of, but not limited to, the reconstruction of boilers,
reconstruction of turbines and generators, izkstallation of a 60 MW
turbogenerator, replacement of high pressure pipes, valves, pumps,
insulation material, boiler, turbine and generator control equipment,
refurbishing and/or replacement of electrostatic precipitators,
installation of desulfurizing units, and refurbishing of heat
exchangers, coal handling and auxiliary equipment.



- 25 -
(b) Upgrading and Rehabilitation. Upgrading and rehabilitation of other
generating plants and of the transmission and distribution systems
consisting of, but not limited to, the replacement and/or
refurbishing of boiler, turbine and generator components, valves,
instrumentation, auxiliary equipment, protection and telecontrol
systeims, machinery and tools, laboratory equipment, computer parts,
insulators, and switching gear.
(c) Technical Assistance. Technical assistance consisting of consultancy
services, training and the provision of computer hardware and
software, aimed at supporting MVMT to enhance its planning,
management and operations. Under the technical assistance component
funds would also be provided for the purchase of a mobile pollution
monitoring unit for in-stack monitoring of sulphur dioxide and
nitrcgen oxides as well as ambient monitoring of nitrogen oxides.
4.04     Project Cost Estimates.  The estimated cost of the proposed project,
including interest during construction, is Ft 27,525 million (US$620 million)
of which Ft 8,685 million (US$193.9 million would be in foreign exchange. The
cost estimates do not include customs duties and taxes, which are not
applicable. The breakdown of the project cost is summarized in Table 4.1
while Annexes 4.2 and 4.3 give the yearly project cost estimates.
4.05     The base cost estimates are expressed in December 1985 prices and
were developed by MVMT based on prices quoted on contracts for equipment,
materials and works for ongoing programs. A physical contingency of 101 was
applied to the base cost and takes into account HVMT's experience in
implementing the 1978-1985 reconstruction program. Annual price contingencies
for the local cost components have been calculated at 7S for 1986, and 6.31
from 1987 through 1992. For the foreign cost components, price contingencies
have been calculated at 7.0S for 1986 and 1987, 7.5% for 1988, 7.71 for 1989,
7.61 for 1990 and 4.5% for 1991 and 1992. Interest during construction has
been calculated on the assumption that only the amount representing the Bank
loan would be onlent to MVMT at 11 interest rate equal to about the current
World Bank lending rate, plus, a 30X margin to cover the foreign exchange risk
(para. 4.11), and the remaining project cost will be financed by MVMT's
internal sources. Based on the regional power subsector project
implementation profile and MVMT's construction schedule the proposed project
is expected to be implemented over 7 years (1986-1992).
4.06     Status of Proiect Preparation.  As already mentioned (para. 4.03)
MVMT's power plant reconstruction program started in 1978 and would continue
until 1994. Thus the Bank's involvement in the power subsector occurs
mid-stream of the program's implementation. Of the eight power plants
affected by the proposed project, reconstruction in five of them on the basis
of designs prepared by MVMT with support from EROTERV started as early as 1978
and is scheduled to be completed by 1992. Thus the reconstruction design of
these plants is a "fait accompli" and very little could be done to change it.
Nevertheless, the mission made an ex post evaluation of the results already
achieved from the reconstruction. This evaluation revealed that at the time
of project decision, fiscal policies of the Government (para. 3.17) did not
permit MVMT to choose, what, in the mission's opinion, would have been

the optimal design in the absence of any financing constraints. The mission's
views were expressed both to the Government and MVHT and the mission was
informed by the Ministry of Finance that the Government is in the process of
revising policies affecting investment financing, and that MVMT is taking
measures to improve the design of the parts not yet reconstructed. MVMT"s
measures were reviewed by the mission and found acceptable. Reconstruction of
the remaining three plants would start in 1986. The mission reviewed the
proposed reconstruction designs and found them economic, technically sound and
satisfactory. However, the mission pointed out, and MVMT agreed, to the need
to resolve the issue of the quality of coal supplied to the plants (para.
1.01). Thus, MVMT agreed to: (a) initiate under terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank a study to identify the major causes of quality
fluctuations in coal supplies at all power plants; (b) submit to the Bank by
June 30, 1987 a copy of the study for review; and (c) adopt by December 31,
1987, and thereafter carry out a program to ensure flame stability at its
power stations based on the results and conclusions of the study and after
taking into consideration the Bank's views on the matter.
4.07     Project Implementation and M'nagement.  Except for the technical
assistance project component which will bc implemented and managed by MVMT,
the project components would be implemented, supervised and managed by each
member enterprise of MVMT concerned (para. 3.01). However, MVMT would be
responsible for co-ordination, overall project management and supervision, and
reporting to the Bank.
4.08     The project would be implemented over a period of seven years
starting from January 1, 1986 and ending in December 31, 1992. The project
implementation schedule is given in Annex 4.4, and it has been prepared on the
basis of MVNT's recent performance and the regional power subsector projeft
implementation profile. The closing date of the loan shall be March 31, 1993
(para. 4.17).
4.09     Loan Amount, Borrower. Beneficiary and Financing Plan.  The Bank has
been asked by the Government (the borrower) and MVMT (the beneficiary) to
assist in financing the reconstruction of the power plants of Gagarin, Ajka,
Borsod and Pecs, the upgrading and rehabilitation of the generation,
transmission and distribution systems, and technical assistance. The loan
amount would be the equivalent of US$64.0 million, which is equal to about 332
of the estimated foreign exchange cost of the proposed project and about 102
of the total project cost, including contingencies and interest during
construction.
4.10     Of the total financing required to implement the proposed project,
MVMT will provide about 902 and the balance will be covered by the proposed
World Bank loan. The financing plan of the proposed project is as shown
below.

4.11     The proposed loan would be made to the Hungarian People's Republic.
The beneficiary of the loan would be MVMT who would receive project funds
through the normal channels. The Bank would enter into Project Agreement with
MVUT to whom the Government would on-lend loan funds. The Government agreed
to on-lend loan funds to MVNT under the following terms: (a) repayment of
principal amount over a period of 15 years, including a grace period of three
years; (b) interest on the principal amount shall be equal to at least the
rate of interest applicable from time to time to the loan, plus, an additional
charge equal to 30Z of the amount of interest; and (c) MVMT shall pay all
amounts of conwitment charges paid by the Borrower. The foreign exchange risk
will be carried by the borrower (see para. 4.05). The conclusion of a
subsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank is
a condition of loan effectiveness.
4.12     Procurement.  MVMT procures for the supply of goods through two
different entities depending on the goods to be supplied. For equipment,
procurement is conducted by ERBE, while for materials procurement is conducted
by a state trading company. Procurement of items to be financed by the Bank
will be the responsibility of ERBE which will prepare the bidding documents
for Bank approval.
4.13     Most of the goods and works proposed for Bank financing (about 83S)
are suitable for international competitive bidding (ICB). Therefore, with the
exception of goods to be procured through limited international bidding (LIB),
or awarded by MVMT to foreign firms through direct contracting, all other
goods and works financed under the proposed Bank loan would be let through
ICB. Limited international bidding will be restricted to imported specialized
equipment manufactured by a small number of companies and not exceeding the
equivalent of US$250,000 (CIF basis) per contract, and in aggregate the
equivalent of US$3.0 million (about 5Z of the loan amount). Under LIB, MVMT
would seek bids from a list of potential suppliers broad enough to assure
competitive prices.  Direct contracting will be restricted to itex
proprietory in nature (i.e. items not subject to competition or available frori
more than one firm) and spare parts imported by MVMT not exceeding the
equivalent of US$300,000 (CIF basis) per contract and in aggregate the
equivalent of US$7.8 million (about t2S of the loan amount). In all cases,
contracts for goods and works financed under the Bank loan would be procured
in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines for Procurement, while
consultancy services will be awarded in accordance with the World Bank
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.
4.14     The manufacturing and installation of the turbogenerator at the
Borsod power plant would involve two contracts; one for civil works (estimated
at about US$400,000 equivalent and not financed under the loan) to be let
through LCB and the other for the supply and erection of the unit (estimated
at about US$14.4 million equivalent) to be let through ICB with Hungarian
participation. Since the civil works contract is small in value (less than
US$400,000) it is considered unlikely that foreign contractors would be
interested in bidding. Regarding the supply and erection contract, although
evaluation of bids would be made by comparing the quotations submitted for
both the supply and the erection of the unit, bidders would be required to bid
separately for the supply and for the erection part. Thus foreign bidders
would quote CIF prices for the supply portion, and prices in foreign and local
currency for the erection portion. Hungarian bidders would quote ex-factory
prices for the supply portion and prices in local currency for the erection
portion. For purposes of bid comparison a preference limited to 152 of the



- 29 -
CIF price of the supply portion of the turbogenerator, or the customs duties,
whichever is less, would be extended to responsive local manufacturers.

4.16     It is estimated that the number of bid packages for Bank financing
will approximate 150. Prior Bank review of the bidding and contract documents
of all packages estimated to cost more than the equivalent of US$500,000 CIF
(approximately 25S of the total packages) will be undertaken. Packages
costing less than this threshold value will be subject to post review by the
Bank.
4.17     Disbursements.  Disbursement from the proceeds of the proposed loan
would be made for: (a) 100l of foreign expenditures for equipment and
materials imported by MVMT; (b) 1001 of foreign expenditures, or lOO1 of the
ex-factory price and 301 of the erection (estimated to represent the foreign
cost component) of the Borsod power plant turbogenerator; and (c) 100l of
foreign expenditures for technical assistance and training. With the
exception of contracts valued less than the equivalent of US$20,000 all
withdrawal applications will be fully documented. Withdrawal applications for
contracts valued at the equivalent of US$20,000 or less will be submitted on
the bases of Statement of Expenditure (SOE). Documentation to support
disbursements against SOE's will be retained by MVMT and MNB will prepare and
submit to the Bank all withdrawal applications. This documentation in
addition to being held for one year after the Loan Closing Date, will be
audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank, correlated with the relevant
withdrawal application and made available for review by Bank representatives
upon request. To avoid delay in project execution due to lack of funds the
Government would open and maintain in dollars a Special Account (Revolving
Fund Account) of US$4,000,000 in its Central Bank on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. The amount of the loan is expected to be fully
disbursed by March 31, 1993 following the Regional power subsector
disbursement profile. The estimated disbursement schedule and profile are
given in Annex 4.1.
4.18     Reporting Requirements.  For the purpose of project monitoring MVMT
agreed to submit to the Bank quarterly, semi-annual and annual progress
reports. In addition MVMT agreed to prepare a project completion report
according to a format and content to be agreed during the s:pervision mission
scheduled for June 1986.
4.19     Environment.  A major aim of the proposed project is the reduction of
particulates emission levels at three of the power stations being
reconstructed (Gagarin, Ajka, Pecs) through the rehabilitation and/or
replacement of electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) and desulfurizing units.
This would result in emission levels falling from 1,000-1,900 mg/Nm3 to
100-150 mg/Nm3. Except for the completion report which will be submitted
within six months after the project closing date, all other reports will be
submitted within 45 days after the end of each reporting period. Although
Bank guidelines for dust emissions are 100 mg/Nm3, the levels after
reconstruction are acceptable because:  (a) emissions of 150 mg/Nm3 are what
reasonably can be achieved with state of the art ESP technology at high inlet
particulate loadings (60,000 mg/Nm3); and (b) a rehabilitation project lacks
the flexibility in design and physical layout of a new facility.
4.20     Because of the increase in station output resulting from the project,
sulphur dioxide (SOz) emissions would increase from 401 to 901 above current
levels. Maximum SOz emissions would be 20.3 tons/hour at the Gagarin plant,



- 31 -
which is within the Bank guideline. Hungary is a signatory to the United
Nations protocol of the 1979 convention on long-range transboundary air
pollution for the Economic Commission for Europe area which was signed in
1985. This requires signatories to reduce by 1993 sulphuc emissions or their
transboundary fluxes by at least 30S below their 1980 levels. In view of the
increased S02 emissions arising from the project, compliance with the United
Nations protocol would ensure that overall SOz emissions arising from MVMT
operations would be in accordance with environmental standards satisfactory to
the Bank. The aspects of the environmental controls are described in Annex
4.5.
4.21     Risks.  As indicated in paragraph 6.07 the economic viability of the
project is insensitive to changes in the capital costs of both the project
itself as well as the nuclear and lignite investments that would follow it.
Should electricity demand turn out to be lower than expected it would be
possible to delay the nuclear and lignite investments planned to follow the
project. The project incremental output is equivalent to about only one
year's projected increase in demand so that any excess capacity would be
temporary.
4.22     Potential fuel supply risks include coal costs being higher than the
figures used in the economic analysis and the supply of coal at mines adjacent
to the reconstructed power stations being insufficient to meet .heir
requirements. As Table 6.3 shows, the economic viability of the project and
its components is insensitive to a 35% increase in the price of coal delivered
to the power stations, equivalent to the estimated c.i.f. price of coal
imported to Hungary. All of the power stations included in the project have
rail links that would enable coal to be imported or moved from other mines in
the event of a shortfall. The power stations also have oil or gas burning
capability. In view of the past performance of the coal mining industry,
there is an appreciable risk that delays to mine reconstruction and
modernization, unexpected geological conditions, labor shortages, machinery
breakdowns or financial shortfalls could result in the production of coal at
mines adjacent to the power stations being insufficient to meet the demand of
the reconstructed power stations. In this event a complicated re-ordering of
energy supply in Hungary would be necessary. This could involve the import of
coal, possibly higher quality household coal, the transfer of coal from mines
to power stations throughout Hungary, increased use of oil and gas and changes
to the optimal running of power stations (merit order). Because of the risk
of coal shortfalls, the Government has agreed to ensure that MVMT is provided
with adequate. suitable and timely supplies of coal and other fuels, to ensure
the efficient and economical operations of MVMT facilities in accordance with
sound public utility practice.

V. FINANCE
Management Information System (MIS)
5.01     The MVMT information system was primarily conceived to provide
information to various controlling bodies whose objectives, though legitimate,
do not necessarily coincide with those of an efficient management of a power
utility. Like all government enterprises, MVMT follows strictly the national
accounting system prescribed by the Ministry of Finance. MVMT is also
required to prepare periodic statistical returns for the Central Statistical
Office. The main issue is not that the information/data collection is
time-consuming and unusually detailed - which it is - but rather that it is
not analyzed and presented in a meaningful fashion for effective decision
making. A number of symptoms points in this direction (e.g., lack of
corporate financial planning, inadequate cost budgeting and cost controls) and
lead to the conclusion that the information system as it is today needs to be
revised.
5.02     A case could be made for simplifying the reporting requirements
through a reduction in the level of detail and frequency of reports-1' and,
to the extent ?ossible, preparing a standardized report of highlights for the
various users.-
5.03     MVMT's MIS is partly computerized, but there is no integration
between its various components.  In a number of key functions, computerization
needs to be introduced, and there is need to enhance computerization in those
areas where applications have already started. The most urgent need for
computerization is in the areas of: Materials Management, Personnel and
Manpower Management, Financial Planning, Billing and Accounting, and
Investment Planning. '.he existing computer hardware and electromechanical
machines (used for accounting) are obsolete and unreliable. There are also
problems of compatibility between existing hardware.
5.04     The proposed project would finance expert assistance, hardware and
software, and training to implement an improved system.
5.05     To undertake the MIS study a consultant would be appointed who would
work with a task force consisting of representatives of MVMT's computing
department and of relevant departments using MIS subsystems. This group would
design detailed information systems and flows, data collection, recording and
reporting systems. The system design will be tailo'ed to local needs and
conditions, it will specify size of computer hardware and software in member
enterprises, training and implementation schedules, manuals, and briefing
programs fcr computer users staff. MVMT agreed to complete a study of MIS
1/ At present, there are monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and
annual reports submitted.
2/ Information required by the various controlling bodies is essentially the
same in substance but each requires a different presentation.



- 33 -
needs by Decembei 1987 and, to that end, to appoint consultants by January 31,
1987 in accordance with Bank guidelines for the employment of consultants.
Accounting System - Auditing and Insurance
5.06     Accounts: MVMT prepares its accounts following guidelines issued by
the Ministry of Finance. Annual accounts are closed and submitted to the
Comptrollers of the Ministry of Finance within three months after the end of
the fiscal year. Each member enterprise prepares its own accounts which are
then centralized and consolidated on an MVMT wide basis. Income tax
liability, allocation of profits among various funds including the employee
sharing fund, are established on an MVMT wide basis since some member
enterprises do not generate revenues. In line with MVMT's lack of financial
autonomy, its member enterprises have little financial responsibility, the
budget required for their operations being supplied by MVMT.
5.07     Salient features of the MVMT accounting system are the great number
of government regulated equity funds, and the frequent changes in accounting
rules over the years dictated by fiscal considerations. Assets are not
revalued and depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis in accordance
with a depreciation schedule set by the Ministry of Finance for different
asset categories. The average depreciation rate for all of MVMT's assets
works out to about 4% which is normal for a predominantly thermal system. The
law provides for setting aside a provision for technical research and
development (R&D) that is used to finance R&D expenditures. The various funds
are depreciated in accordance with the depreciation of the various assets they
finance.
5.08     Audit:  There is an internal auditing group within MVMT that reports
directly to the General Manager. MVMT is subject to financial controls by the
Ministry of Finance but such review is mostly focussed on tax collection and
would not meet the Bank's auditing requirements. MVMT agreed to have an audit
of its annual accounts carried out by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank (in previous Bank lending operations the Merchant and Trust Bank has been
considered an acceptable independent auditor); the audit report and accounts
will be submitted to the Bank within six mouths of the end of the fiscal
year.
5.09     Insurance:  MVMT insures with the State Insurance Company against
third parties liability but does not carry insurance against loss of
electricity assets or set aside provisions for self-insurance.
5.10     The following arrangements concerning such risks apply:
(a)  independent technical inspections to prevent risks such as boiler
explosion are carried out on a regular basis by the Energy
Supervision Institute (AEEF);
(b)  small to medium-size losses which MVMT is economically capable of
absorbing are borne by MVMT;



- 34 -
(c) major losses suffered by MVMT are made good by the Government.
These arrangements are satisfactory.
Past Financial Performance
5.11     As described below, past performance needs to be examined in the
light of existing government regulations pertaining to MVHT aimed at meeting
macroeconomic objectives through taxation, control of input ani output prices
and decisions on investment financing. Actual Income Statements, Balance
Sheets and Statements of Sources and Application of Funds for the years
1981-84 are given in Annexes 5.1 to 5.3, and show the impact of these
regulations on MVMT performance.
5.12     In the 1970's, a combination of subsidized fuel prices (coal, fuel
and natural gas), low cost electricity imports from the CMEA, low direct costs
of labor and insignificant financial charges (since existing assets had
largely been acquired in the form of equity), enabled MVMT to generate
substantial profits that would have translated into sizeable internal cash
generation had not the Government taxed away a substantial part of MVMT's
income.
5.13     The Paks nuclear power plant, which has dominated the investment
program in the power sector, has been the only "State investment"1'
undertaken in that subsector during the last 10 years. The original financing
plan for the project provided that 20S of the project would be financed by
grants and 80S by loans. However, a number of important factors have since
had an adverse effect on MVMT's ability to service the volume of debt involved:
(a) The project, which started in 1973, was to be implemented over 7
years but has yet to be completed;
(b) MVMT's profitability has decreased, because the Government has
increased the prices of energy products (para. 1.16) in an effort to
stabilize the economy and improve its efficiency, so that MVMT's fuel
costs have increased;
(c) Limited reforms in the Banking system were initiated that have led to
increased interest rates and shorter repayment periods; and
(d) As part of the macroeconomic stabilization, the Government has
increased the taxation of enterprise resources.
5.14     For these reasons, MVMT has not been in a position to meet its debt
service obligations on the Paks nuclear power plant, and the Government now
plans to convert the loan for this project into equity that would yield a
dividend to the Government which would be set at 81.
l/ See para. 3.19 for definition.



- ~35-
5.15     To keep any future assumption of debt obligations by MYNT under
review, MVMT agreed to obtain the Bank's prior consent whenever itu internal
cash generation is not sufficient to cover its debt service by at least 1.5
times in any future year. It also agreed to revalue all foreign debts in
accordance with the current rate of exchange and to calculate the debt service
obligations accordingly.
5.16     MVMT is one of the few utilities that does not experience problems of
overdue accounts receivable (they represent about 1.2 months of sales in 1984,
an outstanding performance) or accounts payable, the current ratio was
maintained at the satisfactory level of 1.3 in 1984.
5.17     An analysis of MVMT's financial data indicates that over the period
1981-1984, the amount of resources transferred to the State under various
taxation schemes would have covered about 45S of its investment expenditures
including the Paks nuclear power plant (the bulk of capital outlays for this
project took place during this period). The most logical approach in
addressing MVMT's financial problems would therefore be to modify the taxation
system and establish a financial policy under which the MVHT financial
structure would be established in a long term perspective, based on a policy
of financial autonomy and full responsibility for mobilizing resources needed
for the financing of investment, even though major investment decisions, e.g.,
on new power stations, would still require government approval, as is the case
in many other countries.
Future Financial PerformanceL'
5.18     As explained in Chapter III, the Government is in the process of
implementing economic reforms in the competitive sector. Most of the elements
of the reforms proposed for the competitive sector are being extended to MVMT
while leaving intact the Government's role in key sector decisions, e.g., on
major investment, or electricity trade with the CMEA countries. The financial
objectives proposed under this project constitute another step in the
direction of greater financial autonom3 for MVMT tirough the setting of
monitorable financial targets and rationalization of input and output prices
and elimination of Government investment subsidies.
5.19     A number of principles have to be followed in setting financial
targets for MVMT. The targets ought to be well understood, easily monitorable
and the possibilities of influencing actual results through accounting
manipulations should be minimal. At the same time. the targets ought to be
consistent with economic principles such as long-run marginal cost pricing,
setting of interest rates on funds borrowed at a level that reflects the
scarcity of resources, and a simple and predictable taxation based on a stable
tax base. As discussed in detail in paras. 3.15-3.18, the level of taxation
1/ Projected Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Statements of Sources and
Applications of Funds for MVMT for the years 1985-92 are given in Annexes
5.4 through 5.6.



- 36 -
of MVMT profits is equal to that of enterprises operating in the competitive
sector. beginning in 1986. Tax allowances currently in place such as
amortization of AEB loans from pretax profits or treatment of asset
replacement as operating expenditure, should be discontinued, and  MvrT should
be exempt from the differential turnover tax. The financial targets
established within this framework should enable MVMT to maintain a balanced
financial structure; satisfactory debt/equity ratio, current ratio, debt
service coverage ratio and internal cash generation.
5.20     A cash generation covenant is proposed, since a rate of return
covrenant would not be relevant in the absence of meaningful values for the
most important assets of MVMT, which have been procured through past CMEA
barter agreements. The level of cash generation would be computed after
taxes, debt service, dividend payments and working capital requirements and
would be related to the average construction requirements during the current
year and the preceding year. Beginning in 1987, the cash generation target
would be fixed at 35S, after a minimum dividend payment of Ft 3.5 billion in
1987 and Ft 4.4 billioa per annum thereafter to compensate at least partially
for the reduction of MVMrT's debt service for the Paks plant (see para. 5.14).
During negotiations MVMT agreed to these cash generation targets. MVMT also
agreed to furnish to the Bank by September 30 of each year a realistic
forecast of its estimated cash generation for that year and the next year, to
determine the prospects of MVMT achieving the financial target and the
measures required to be taken to that effect by MVMT and the Government.
5.21     In conjunction with the agreement with the Government to implement
its policy for keeping the producer prices of energy in line with their
economic costs (para. 1.19), the cash generation targets mentioned in the
preceding paragraph would imply that electricity tariffs would be maintained
on average close to LRMC. The project would thus support a move towards more
efficient input and output prices in the power subsector. Increases in
electricity prices for consumers would be required if the Government were to
allow producer electricity prices to fall in real terms to the level of their
LRMCs. Such increases in household electricity prices would be a continuation
of the Government's policy for eliminating the difference bet.ween price and
LRMC, as demonstrated by the 16-332 increases in household electricity prices
in January 1985, compared to inflation of about 8S. The LRMC pricing study
(para. 2.23) would provide the necessary information to enable MVMT and the
Government to draw up a detailed strategy for eliminating the distortions in
electricity prices for all groups of consumers. The other energy pricing
studies (para. 1.19) would enable similar strategies to be prepared for the
consumer prices of other fuels.
5.22     The financial projections shown in Annexes 5.4 - 5.6 assume that MVMT
fuel prices would remain constant in nominal terms, falling in real terms,
until they reach parity with economic cost, which would be maintained. The
exception is the producer price of coal, which is currently less than LRMC,
!nd which would reach parity with LRMC in 1990 and be adjustment for inflation
thereafter. Producer electricity prices would be adjusted for inflation,
which with increasing fuel prices, would ensure that real tariffs would fall
to parity with LRMC. The details of a strategy for eliminating electricity
price distortions would be worked out during the LRMC tariff study and energy



- 37 -
pricing impact study (paras. 2.23-2.24). For the financial projections it has
been assumed that the average household tariff level would increase at about
91 p.a. in real terms which, with increasing LRMC, would result in tariffs
being maintained at 601 of LRMC. However, the increases for certain
categories of domestic consumption (e.g. for consumption above a certain
level) could be higher (para. 2.24). Other details of the assumptions used
for the financial projections are given in Annex 5.7.
5.23     On the basis of the above assumptions and the level of investment
projected for the years 1986-1992, MT would be able to firance about
one-third of its investment requirements from internally generated funds. The
remainder of the investment financing requirements would be raised through
borrowings from AFB and from customer contributions and other sources. The
projected financing plan for the power facilities construction program for the
years 1986-92 is shown in detail in Annex 5.6.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Introduction
6.01     Since the project is a time-slice of MVMT's investment program, with
the reconstruction of four power stations accounting for about 60S of the
total project cost, the economic justification of the project involved two
analyses: (a) least cost analysis of the reconstruction component; and (b)
rate of return analysis on MVMT's overall investment program. The basis of
the economic justification of the reconstruction component is that
reconstruction is the least cost means of meeting the demand for electricity
during the period 1989-1995. The incremental output of the reconstructed power
stations, compared to their output without their reconstruction, enables the
large nuclear and lignite investments planned for the 1990s to be delayed.
Consequently, the least cost justification of the project involved estimating
the system capital, fuel and other operating costs for alternative investment
programs with and without the power station reconstruction project. A rate of
return analysis was also carried out using tariff levels as a proxy for
benefits, but this served mainly as a check of the relation of electricity
tariffs to LRMC. Rate of return analysis on a program containing a project of
this type is conceptually difficult because of the negative and positive
incremental output of the project during its construction and implementation
phases and the dominance of lumpy nuclear units on the investment program
during the period.
Least Cost Analysis
6.02     The effect of reconstructing the power stations of Ajka, Borsod,
Gagarin and P6cs is to produce about an additional 266 MW of expected net
capacity from them which, in conjunction with improved availability, provides
about a further 2,300 GWh/a. Higher station availability also reduces the
need for reserve capacity to maintain system reliability at peak.
Consequently, the power station reconstruction program allows the nuclear and
lignite investments to be delayed by about one year, generating savings in
capital and operating costs. Investment programs for the nuclear and lignite
scenarios, with and without the reconstruction program, are shown in Annexes
6.1 and 6.2.
6.03     The overall reconstruction program was justified by calculating the
present value of all system capital, fuel and operating costs for investment
programs with and without the reconstruction program. The reconstruction
program would be economically justified if the present value of these costs in
the case with reconstruction were lower than in the without case. This would
mean that the reconstruction program would be a lower cost means of providing
incremental output than new plant. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the
long term investment program, the project has been evaluated against both
nuclear and lignite scenarios. Since accurate data was not available on the
capital cost of the nuclear option, and to a much lesser extent for the
lignite option, the comparison between the with and without reconstruction
cases was made against a range of likely capital costs.

6.04     While this approach can show that the overall reconstruction program
is economically justified, it does not show whether all individual projects
within the reconstruction program are justified. In principle, each project
could be seperately evaluated by optimizing the long term system development
program with and without the project. Apart from being very time consuming,
this approach might produce misleading results since some projects are small
in relation to the annual increase in system demand and taken alone, would
affect the quality of supply (system reliability), which is difficult to
value, rather than the phasing of long term investment. A LIMC approach was
used by MVNT to justify each individual reconstruction project. The
difference between system capital, fuel and operating costs in the without
project and with project investment programs was calculated, excluding these
costs for the plants in the reconstruction program. The present value of this
saving in other system costs was divided by the present value of the
incremental output of the plant in the reconstruction program (GWh), to
arrive at the incremental value to the system of the output of the plants in
the reconstruction program. This unit avoided cost (Ft/kWh), was referred to
as the average incremental system saving (AISS) and used to value the output
of incremental output from each project. Since no valuation of the output of
the plant is made in terms of consumers' willingness to pay this is not
compsrable to the usual cost-benefit or rate of return analysis shown later in
para. 6.08. The electricity consumption of consumers, and consequently the
value they place on it, is constant in the with and without project cases so
that the analysis is still on the basis of least cost. Essentiall7, the
approach is one of allocating the system savings of the reconstruction program
among individual projects.
6.05     The results of the overall analysis of the reconstruction program,
based on detailed analysis shown in Annex 6.3, are shown in Table 6.1 below.
Since the present value of system costs for the with reconstruction case is
lower than in the without case, for the likely range of capital costs of the
nuclear and lignite investment programs, the reconstruction program would be
justified. Most of the savings from the project arise from the delaying of
later nuclear and lignite investment. As Table 6.1 shows, the savings
increase substantially as the capital costs of the nuclear and lignite
investments increase.

6.06     The least cost analysis for each of the four projects in the
reconstruction program, shown in Table 6.2 below, demonstrates that all of the
projects within this program are economically justified.
Sensitivity Analysis
6.07     The sensitivity analysis shown in Table 6.3 indicates that the
economic justification of the Project is not sensitive to likely changes in
key parameters. In particular, tests with a 50X increase in project capital
cost and increasing coal prices by 351 to the price of internationally coal
delivered to Hungary, Ft 113/GJ (US$60/ton), resulted in each of the four
power stations in the reconstruction program still having a positive net
system saving. This remains true in the unlikely case of the capital costs of
the lignite and nuclear plant falling by 20S.

A1 Costs are present values to 1985 at 12 discount rate.
/2 Incremental system saving is incremental output (GWh) of the power station
multiplied by the AISS. For lignite scenario AISS = 3.63 Ft/hWh. For
nuclear scenario AISS = 3.49 Ft/kWh. System savings are based on low
nuclear and lignite capital costs.
13 Incremental station cost is the incremental capital (cost of
reconstruction). incremental fuel and incremental operating costs of the
power station, i.e. the difference between these costs in the With
Reconstruction and Without Reconstruction cases.
/4 Net saving is incremental system saving, minus incremental station cost.

Rate of Return Analysis
6.08     The calculation of a rate of return for the project presents some
particular difficulties peculiar to a project of this type: (a) the power
station reconstruction component has negative incremental output during the
period when the units are withdrawn from service for reconstruction, thus
making the definition of the incremental output attributable to the project
difficult; (b) the reconstruction program is implemented over a period of
about 15 years, but MVMT does not consider it realistic to assume that all the
reconstructed plant will be in service after the end of the century; and (c)
the investment program is dominated by large lumpy nuclear uni s coming on
stream during the period of the reconstruction program, making the the rate of
return sensitive to the definition of the period of the time-slice of
incremental demand. Because of these difficulties the adequacy of tariff
levels was evaluated through a detailed evaluation in comparison to LRMCs,
rather than through rate of return analysis (paras. 2.20-2.22).
6.09     Despite the problems inherent in the calculation, a rate of return
was calculated on a time-slice of MVMT's investment program. This time-slice
consisted of investment to meet the incremental system demand during the
period 1989 to 1995 when the last reconstructed plant will be returning to
full service.
6.10     Measurable costs comprise:  (a) the capital costs of the
reconstruction program, the 5th and 6th Paks nuclear units, the
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydro station, transmission and distribution; (b)
incremental operating costs of this investment; and (c) the fuel cost to meet
the incremental demand. The March 1986 Bank oil price projections (in
constant 1984 prices) of $12/bbl in 1986 increasing to $18/bbl in 1995 were
used in the rate of return analysis, and in the least cost and financial
analysis. Measurable benefits were limited to the incremental revenue
associated with the incremental demand. calculated on the basis of tariff
projections shown in the financial analysis. No allowance was made for the
environmental benefits of reduced dust emisions, or the costs of increased
SOz emmisions, because of the difficulty of accurate measurement. Detailed
assumptions are given in Annex 6.4.
6.11     Under these assumptions the rate of return would be 12S, equal to the
opportunity cost of capital. This is indicative of the average level of
tariffs being greater than LRMC, which is offset by the prices of fuel for
electricity generation also being, on average, above their economic costs.

it to the Bank for review by December 31, 1987 (para. 2.23);
Cc)  the following:
ti) under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, initiate a
study to identify the major causes of quality fluctuations in
coal supplies at all power plants;



- 44 -
(ii)  submit by June 30, 1987 to the Bank a copy of the study for
review; and
(iii)  adopt by December 31, 1987, and thereafter carry out a program
to ensure flame stability at its power stations based on the
results and conclusions of the study and after taking into
consideration the Bank's views on the matter (para. 4.06);
(d) prepare and submit to the Bank quarterly, semi-annual and annual

the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year (para.
5.08);
(g)  obtain the Bank's prior consent to any borrowing it plans to
undertake whenever its internal cash generation is not sufficient to
cover its debt service on a yearly basis at least 1.5 times in any
future year, and revalue all foreign debts in accordance with the
current rate of exchange and to calculate the debt service
obl gations accordingly (para. 5.15); and
(h) beginning in 1987, generate internally for financing its investment
program, funds equivalent to at least 352 of the average construction
requirements during the current year and the preceding year, the
level of cash generation being computed after taxes, debt service,
working capital requirements and dividend payments (of a minimum of
Ft 3.5 billion in 1987 and Ft 4.4 billion per annum thereafter); and
furnish to the Bank by September 30 of each year a realistic forecast
of its estimated cash generation for the current year and the next
year, to determine the prospects of MVMT achieving the financial
target and any measures required to be taken to that effect by MVMT
and the Government (para. 5.20).
7.04     Subject to the foregoing, the project would be suitable for an IBRD
loan of US$64.0 million on standard terms. Apart from the conclusion of a
subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.1L), t ere are no
special conditions of loan effectiveness.

Electricity Tariffs and Long Run Marginal Cost
Long Run Marginal Costs
1.       LRMC has two components:  (a) the cost oi producing an extra kWh at a
particular time of the day or year, which is mainly the fuel consumed in
generation, adjusted for lasses; and (b) the capacity cost of bringing forward
(or delaying) investment to meet a sustained increase (or decrease) in
demand. In translating these marginal costs into tariffs, marginal fuel costs
are almost always represented as prices/kWh that may vary by time of day or
season, while the marginal capacity cost is charged either as a price per kW
of maYimum demand or as a kWh charge applied during peak periods.
Marginal Fuel Cost
2.       Studies carried out by the Bank using the RELCOMP computer program to
simulate hourly system operation during winter and summer seasons have shown
tha_ (a) the marginal fuel cost is equivalent to the incremental fuel cost of
the 215 MW steam units at Dunamenti or Tisza; and (b) the marginal fuel cost
does not vary significantly throughout the year. The constancy of the
marginal fuel cost is because the 2,150 MW of this plant can absorb all the
variation in demand after imports, which account for 30S of annual supply,
have been scheduled.
3.       There is some uncertainty about the appropriate fuel price since the
Dunamenti units at least are marginal gas consumers, i.e. consume what gas
remains after the requirements of other gas users have been met. As the
supply of gas is fixed in the medium term through 5-year trading arrangements
with the Soviet Union, fuel oil would need to be used to supply the
difference. At present natural gas has been imported at a price close to fuel
oil parity and in any case, fixed gas supply would imply an economic price
equivalent to the cost of the fuel oil used by the marginal consumer, i.e. the
Dunamenti power station, i.e. Ft llO/GJ ($93/ton) in March 1986. Although gas
prices in Western Europe fell below parity with fuel oil in 1985, it is not
clear whether gas suppliers would maintain this differential after the
upheaval in energy prices in early 1986.

4.       Based on an incremental net heat rate of 8,860 kJ/kWh (2,120
kcal/kWh) and a c.i.f. fuel oil price of Ft ll0/GJ (US$93/t), the marginal
fuel cost sent out from the power station would be
8,860 x 110 x 10-6 = 0.98 Ft/kWh
or US$21.71MWh. Adjusted for losses, the marginal fuel cost is as shown in

Marginal Capacity Costs
5.       The long run average incremental cost (LRAIC) was used as a proxy for
the LRMC of transmission and distribution capacity. The present value stream
of incremental investments for the years 1985 to 1990 was anuitized, added to
the present value of the stream of incremental operating and maintenance -osts
(estimated at 12 of the investment costs) and divided by the present value -
the annual increments in maximum demand.  Present values were calculated at a
discount rate of 12Z which is the opportunity cost of capital in Hungary. The
calculation is shown in Attachment 1.
6.       The marginal cost of generating capacity was obtained from the report
"EMENA - Marginal Costs for Electricity Pricing" (June 7, 1985) prepared by
EMPPE. It was calculated by re-optimizing a least cost generation investment

program (lignite scenario) with a sustained 200 MW increase in demand using
the WASP computer program of the IAEA. Bringing forward the investment
program to meet a sustained increment in demand would result in higher present
value investment and fixed operating costs. In addition, there would be a
higher cost of unserved energy (outages), particularly in the years before the
investment program could be adjusted to the increment in demand. Bringing
forward base load plant such as lignite results in lower system fuel costs.
These fuel savings were estimated by simulating the operations of the advanced
investment program with the original demand forecast and subtracting these
fuel costs from fuel costs of the base case. Using this methodology, the
marginal capacity cost of generation was estimated to be US$51.2/kW/a
(Ft 2,305/kW/a) at 1986 prices. The marginal capacity costs of generation,
transmission and distribution by voltage level are shown in Table 2.

Comparison of Tariffs to LRMC
7.       The MVMT tariff structure consists of up to three kWh rates for
consumption at peak, during the day and at night as well as up to two maximum
demand charges for system peak and other times. Average prices per kWh were
calculated for each consumer category using information on consumer demand
characteristics provided by MVMT, supplemented by information from other
countries and mission estimates. The results are shown in Attachment 2.
8.       A similar analysis was carried out to combine the LRMC data in Tables
1 and 2 with the consumer load data. Average tariffs are compared to the
LRMCs expressed as a price/kWh in Attachment 3. These estimates show tariffs
ranging from only 38Z of LRMC for households in Budapest to 582 above LRMC for
the LV II tariff for producers. These results are summarized in Table 2.2 of
the main text.

Environment
Dust Emissions
1.       A major impact of project implementation will be the overall
reduction of dust emission levels from three to four power srations under
consideration (Borsod already has high efficiency electrostatic precipitators
that do not require rehabilitation). A summary of current dust levels and
anticipated changes for all plants is given below:
Existing Emission         Post Rehabilitation Emission
Power Plant         Levels (mg/Nm  )                 Levels (mg/Nm  )
Gagarin                 1,000                  150
Borsod                     50 - 250            50 - 250 (no rehabilitation)
Ajka                    1,900/6,300 /1        100/6,300 /1
Paco                    1,325/  530 /1        150/  530 71
/1 Some older boilers, destined to be decommissioned, will not be part of the
current rehabilitation scheme.
A level of 150 mg/Nm3 is the Government requirement for new electrostatic
precipitators (ESP's). All plants replacing their ESP's will meet or exceed
Gover]ument requirements.  For Borsod the Government requirement is 225
mg/NmM - most of the time the station is in compliance and has never been
fined for dust emissions.
2.       World Bank Guidelines for dust emission are 100 mg/Nm3. However,
levels of 150 mg/Nm3 are considered acceptable for several reasons; (i) ash
loadings into the ESP's are so high that removal efficiencies corresponding to
emission levels of 150 mg/Nm3 reflect state-of-the art in ESP technology;
and (ii) a rehabilitation project does not have the same flexibility in either
design or physical layout as a new facility.

Sulphur Emissions
3.       Every station visited had sulphur emissions in excess of Government
allowances. In all cases the required retribution was estimated as 50% of the
assessed fine. The concession was offered because the Government felt that
sulphur dioxide emissions could not, as a practical matter, be reduced at
these stations.
4.       A summary of sulphur dioxide emission characteristics, and both World
Bank and Hungarian Government requirements are presented below:
Actual Emissions (Tons/Hr)
Maximum            Hungarian          World Bank
Power Plant    Present       (Post/Rehab.)    Allowance (Tons/Hr)       (Tons/Hr)
Gagarin          13-14           20.3                  8.5               21.0
Borsod           7.4             10.3                 4.4             4.2-21.0 /1
Ajka             3.7              7.0                  1.1               21.0
P&cs             7.4             10.6                  2.6               21.0
/1 Value depends on background level, data unavailable at Borsod.
There is a growing concern among many European nations about the impacts of
acid aid pollution (sulphur and nitrogen oxides) on their forests and lakes.
The disturbing feature about this pollution is that it is non-local: impacts
develop from distant sources.
5.       In an effort to curb the growing threat of "environmental
acidification", the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE)
recently issued (July 8, 1985) a directive for overall countrywide 30%
reductions of su.lphur dioxide emissions by 1993. Nineteen countries,
including Hungary, signed this directive.
Health and Emission Monitoring
6.       At both Ajka and Borsod, t'.Lere were indications of respiratory
problems among younger members of the neighboring population. The results of
these locations cannot, a priori, be identified solely with the power
stations. Both locations contain several other polluting industries which
could also contribute to this unfortunate situation.
7.       However, at Ajka the older boilers are only fitted with mechanical
collectors (75-80 percent removal efficiencies). This provides an intolerably

high level of dust emissions. MVMT should be encouraged to rapidly proceed
vith their plans for reducing these emissions.
8.       All plants only perform in-stack monitoring for dust, no stack
measurements of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are made. These emissions
are estimated by a combination of laboratory procedures and chemical
calculations.
9.       Ambient monitoring networks exist in the vicinities of all power
stations. Pollutions measured always include dust (both settleable and
suspended), in many cases sulphur dioxide and in some instances nitrogen
oxides. The networks are administered by regional organizations (KOJAL) whose
prime interest is public health. Consequently monitoring locations are
established to protect public health (population centers, schools, etc.)
rather than to characterize pollution sources.
10.      The project will enhance monitoring capability with a mobile unit
equipped to provide measurements which will supplement data currently
collected.
11.      Monitoring will provide in-stack measurements of sulphur dioxide
emissions important to complying with the ECE Directive. It will also provide
both in-stack and ambient levels of nitrogen oxides, an important pollutant
whose levels so far have only been estimated as minimal.

POWER PROJECT
Assumptions Used for the Financial Projections
1. Electricity sales have been based on the load forecast used for project
justification (Annex 2.4).
2. Electricity Prices
- For "producer" prices, an (actual) increase of 8.5Z in 1986 has been
taken into account; price increases thereafter are expected to equal
inflation.
- For households no increases have been assumed in 1986 and 1987; annual
increases assumed for 1988-1992 would maintain household tariffs on
average at about 60Z of LRMC.
3. Fuel Costs
- The fuel quantity per type of fuel has been determined by ME4T on the
basis of the planned generation program.
- The fuel oil price would remain constant in nominal terms until the end
of 1990. Beginning in 1991 it would be increased annually to maintain
parity with the border price.
- The ccl price would reach parity with LRMC in 1990 and be adjusted for
inflation thereafter.
- The price of natural gas would be maintained constant in nominal terms
during 1986 and 1987. Starting in 1988 it would be increased annually
to imaintain parity with its economic cost.
4. Purchases of Electricity - Increases in the prices of electricity imports
are expected to be of the order of 5% per annum.
5. Income tax for the years 1986-92 has been calculated at 40% of income
before tax and dividends.

7. Accounts Receivable represent 1 month of sales.
8. Long term debt of Ft 55,036 million relative to the Paks I nuclear power plant is
expected to be converted into equity as follows: Ft 27,036 in 1986 for Units 1 and 2.
Ft 14,000 in 1987 for Unit 3 and Ft 14,000 in 1988 for Unit 4. A dividend of 8S per
annum would be paid on the debt converted into equity. For debt other than the proposed
IBRD loan, it has been assumed that new borrowings will be obtained at the current terms
(interest rate of 131 and grace period of 7 years) during 1986, and at a reduced
interest rate of 121 for borrowings thereafter, in line with the declining rate of
inflation.

POWER PROJECT
Outline of Terms of Reference for the Analysis of
MVNT ManaRement Information System
1.       The objective of the study, based on a critical examination of MVMT's
existing systems, is to recoumend steps that should be taken to improve the
systems, particularly the transition from manual to automated data
processing. The areas of concern are in accounting, corporate financial
planning, materials management and control, critical path analysis,
maintenance planning and execution, manpower planning and control and data
base.
2.       A first attempt to survey the existing computer hardware and software
was made during the appraisal of this project with the help of a consultant.
It has been agreed that MVMT will form a task force for a detailed MIS study
and for preparation of a list of required hardware and software to be financed
under the loan. Consultancy services will be financed under the loan to
assist the MVMT task force in the study and provide regular advice both while
it is carried out and during the subsequent implementation phase.
3.       The study will look at the possibility of computerizing the
accounting system taking into account the accounting rules imposed by the
Ministry of Finance and the compulsory rules for all companies laid down by
the Central Statistical Office (KSH).
4.       The study will define implementation stages and training needs
required for staff involved in the design and implementation of MIS; this
would involve assessing the quality of manpower in the domains which will be
affected by the MIS.
5.       The decision on the choice of office technology will have to be made
bearing in mind the constraints under the trade embargo on sales of high
technology items to Comecon countries.

HUNGARY
POWER PROJECT
Least Cost Analysis
Methodology
1.       The approach adopted was to evaluate the canital, operating and fuel
costs of gen-ration investment programs with and without the power station
reconstruction program. The reconstruction program would be justified on
least cost grounds if the present value of these system costs in the with
reconstruction case were lower than in the without project case. Costs were
discounted using a discount rate of 12 equal to the oportunity cost of
capital in Hungary.
2.       This analysis would show whether the overall program were
economically justified, but it does not snow whether all individual projects
within the reconstruction program are justified. In principle, each project
could be seperately evaluated by optimizing the long term system development
program with and without the project. Apart from being very time consuming,
this approach .ijht produce misleading results since some projects are small
in relation to the annual increase in system demand and taken alone, would
affect the quality of iupply (system reliability), which is difficult to
w.lue, rather than the phasing of long term investment. A LIMC approach ws
used by MVMT to justify each .ndividual reconstruction project. The
difference in system capital, fuel and operating costs was calculated,
excludin these costs for the plants in the reconstruction program. The
present value of this saving in system cost was divided by the present value
of the incremental output of the plant in the reconstruction program (GWh),
to arrive at the incremental value to the system of the output of the plants
in the reconstruction program. This unit avoided cost (Ft/kWh), was nefered
to as the average incremental syster saving (AISS) and used to value the
output of incremental output from each project. Since no valuation of the
output of the plant is made in terms of consumers' willingness to pay this is
not comparable to the usual cost-benefit or rate of return analysis shown in
Annex 6.2. The consumption of consumers is oonstant in the with and without
project cases so that the analysis is still cm the basis of least cost.
Essentially, the the approach allocates the system savings of the overall
reconstruction program among individual projects within the program.
Key Assumptions
3.       All costs were in constant 1985 prices based on original data
provided by MVNT in constant 1981 prices. The data were escalated by first,
converting to US dollars at the 1981 exchange rate of $US1.00 = Ft 34.31.
second, increasing the US$ amount by the increase in the Unit Value Index of
manufactured exports to developing countries from five industrial market

economies published by the United Nations, and finally converting back to mld
1985 Forints at the exchange rate of *USl.00  Ft 51.08. This procedure gave
an overall adjusment of 1.393 to the 1981 Foriut price. Compterd to using the
Hungarian producer price index, this procedure resulted in project costs that
were generally compatible to costs in convertible currency markets.
4.       Capital Costs of the reconstruction program were calculated by MM6T.
There are some minor differences with the costs in the project cost tables
caused by small modifications to the program during appraisal, but these are
insignificant. Capital costs for the nuclear and lignite projects that would
follow the reconstruction pregram were based on data used in Eroterv long term
planning studies.
5.       Operating Costs, which comprise mainly salaries, workers benefits and
maintenance materials, were estimated by YMT.
6m       Fuel Prices. A coal supply model run by Eroterv estimated that the
marginal cost of coal for power generation in Hungary was Ft 60/GJ at 1981
prices, or Ft 84/GJ (US$45/tce) at 1985 prices. This is roughly equivalent to
the f.o.b. price of US coal at east coast ports. It is close to estimates of
the LRAIC of lias (black) coal presented in the Investment Review (Report
5585-KU). Because of increasingly poor geological conditions for mining
Hungarian coal from existing mining areas, the coal price was increased at 1I
p.a. in real terms so that the price of coal in 2000 was about 16S higher than
in 1985. A sensitivity study was run with coal being priced at the estimated
c.i.f. Drice of imported coal to Hungary of about US$60/tce, or Ft 113/GJ. A
base fuel oil price in 1985 prices of Ft 19O/GJ (US$150/t) was used in the
analysis, consisting of an international f.o.b. price of US$135/t, plus
freight to Hungary of US$15/t. Based on reported prices for recent contracts
for the sale of Soviet gas to West European countries and the reported price
adjustment formulae, a border price for natural gas of US$Z.84/GJ (US$121/toe)
was used, equivalent to Ft 145/GJ. Using information supplied by IMVT a gas
transmission price of Ft !9/GJ was added to yield a base price of Ft 17L/GJ
(in 1985 prices) for gas delivered to the power station. The prices of oil
and gas were assumed to increase according to the Bank's April 1986 oil price
projection, whereby the crude oil price in constant 1984 dollars falls from
US$27.4 in 1985 to US$15.5 in 1990 and then increases to US$17.9 in 1995.
Thereafter, oil a% A gas prices were assumed to increase at 31 p.a. Fuel costs
were simulated using Eroterv's production cost model. Because the results of
this simulation did not provide for seperate gas and oil costs (power stations
are dual fired) a weighted average fuel cost for gas and oil was used to
adjust the Er.Aerv data using a projected 1990 hydrocarbon fuel consumption of
80X gas and 2Q2 oil.
Results of Economic Analysis
7.       Because the long term generation investment program is not finalized
and because of uncertainties about the capital cost of the nuclear option, the
reconstruction program was evaluated against a background of both nuclear and

lignite scenarios. The reasons for this are discussed in paras. 6.03 and
2.17-2.18 of the main text. Tables showing the cash flows for the least cost
analysis for the nuclear scenario are shown in the following pages. Tables
showing the summary least cost analysis and calculation of the AISS for the
lignite scenario are also shown. The tables for each of the power stations in
the reconstruction program are identical to the nuclear scenario, except that
the system saving benefits are greater in proportion to the ratios of the
AISSs for the two scenarios.

Rate of Return Analysis
Introduction
1.       The additional output of the reconstructed plant is available to the
system from 1988 to about 1994 as the rehabilitated units are brought back to
service. Before 1988 the output of the units is less than in the without
project case, since the units are removed from service for reconstruction.
The incremental output also changes slightly after 1994 as the perforuance of
the units deteriorates due to wear and tear, but this is insignificant for the
rate of return analysis. The rate of return was therefore calculated on a
timeslice of system costs related to the increment in demand from 1988 to
1994. During this period the 5th and 6th Paks nuclear units and the
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros multipurpose hydro station comes into operation.
Key Assumptions
2.       Capital and operating cost data used in the rate of return analysis
are identical to the costs for the incremental plant used in the least cost
analysis (Annex 6.3). MVMT does not consider that the reconstructed plant will
be available beyond the end of the century, although the possibility for
further reconstruction would no doubt exist. No incremental output from the
reconstructed plant beyond 2000 was considered in both the least cost and rate
of return analyses. This presents problems for the rate of return analysis
since the nuclear, hydro, tranmission and distribution plant commissioned to
meet the incremental demand will exist far beyond 2000. This problem was
resolved by calculating residual values for these investments, equivalent to
the present value of the annuitized capital cost (at the opportunity cost of
capital of 121) over the remaining life of the plant.
3.       No reliable data was available on the cost of the small changes to
imports during the period of the timeslice. Accordingly it was assumed that
these imports would cost the same as generation in Hungary. Fuel costs were
therefore calculated by multiplying the incremental generation by the average
cost of generation in Hungary in the year.
4.       It is conceptually difficult to measure the willingness to pay for
public utility services in existing markets. The Bank therefore adopts the
approach of using incremental revenues as a proxy for willingness to pay,
recognizing that benefits estimated under this approach normaly underestimate
the true willingness to pay. Consequently, the rate of return analysis
provides information more on the adequacy of tariff levels than the economic
viability of the project. Accordingly, the real tariff levels implied by the

AMNEX 6.4
Page 2 of 2
financial analysis were used as proxy for benefits. With these tariff
increases the rate of return would be 122, equal to the opportunity cost of
capital. This is not surprising since tariffs are on average slightly greater
than LRMC and the average price of fuel is also greater than the economic
cost. Neither benefits from reduced emissions of dust to the environment were
considered, nor were costs of increased SO2 emissions, because of the
difficulty of measuring environmental impacts. The rate of return calculation
is presented in Attachbent 1.
