IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
HUNGARY
POWER PROJECT
(Loan 2697-HU)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Hungary Power Project
(Loan No. 2697-HU, US$64.0 million equivalent) approved on May 20, 1986. The Republic
of Hungary was the Borrower. The Beneficiary was the former Hungarian Electric Power Trust
(MVMT), reorganized effective January 1, 1992 as the Hungarian Power Companies Ltd.
(MVM Rt). The project was the Bank's first with the Beneficiary. Its implementation period
coincided with the fall of communism in Central Europe and the restructuring of the company.
It was successfully completed in spite of these circumstances.
The loan was closed on March 31, 1995, two years after the original loan closing date.
The delay was due mainly to the modification of an important project component from supply
and installation of a 60 MW turbogenerator at the existing coal-fired Borsod power plant to
supply and installation of a 150 MW gas-fired combined-cycle cogenerating unit at the existing
Kelenfold power and district heating plant at Budapest. This required an amendment to the Loan
Agreement and a change of project description, both of which were made in July 1991. It also
required negotiation of a 35 million ECU loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) to
cover the increased foreign costs of about US$43 million. The Bank loan amount was
unchanged and it was fully disbursed by end March 1995. The project was completed when the
gas-fired combined cycle unit at Kelenfold plant was commissioned on December 23, 1995.
The ICR was prepared by Messrs. Richard Hamilton, Wiegong Cao (Consultant) and
C. K. Chandran (Consultant), Energy and Environment Division, Central Europe Department.
The work began during February/March 1996. It is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Loan and Project Agreements, Supervision Reports, correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower/Beneficiary, internal Bank memoranda and a Completion Report prepared by MVM
Rt in March 1996. The report was reviewed by Mr. Franz Kaps, Project Advisor (EC2DR).






EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.    The project was one of the earliest Bank-financed projects in Hungary and the first in the
power sector. It was originally intended to: (a) increase utilization of domestic coal in primary
energy generation in accordance with Government policy at that time; (b) reconstruct and
rehabilitate 8 coal power stations (with some marginal expansion) belonging to Hungarian
Power Companies Limited (MVM1) and upgrade other MVM power stations, transmission and
distribution systems; and (c) improve MVM 's operational efficiency and management. In 1990
the worsening financial situation in the coal mining industry led the Government to establish the
Center for Restructuring of Coal Mining, which then began closing unviable mines. In
consultation with the Bank the project was modified in July 1991 to drop the coal-fired 60 MW
component at Borsod plus various small items and construct instead a gas-fired 150 MW gas
turbine generator and heat recovery boiler at Kelenfold in Budapest to provide both electricity
and heat. The rest of the project was unaffected.
Implementation Experience and Results
2.    The original project was defined as a time-slice of MVM's investment program from
1986-92. About 81 % of the US$620 million program was intended for reconstruction,
rehabilitation, upgrading and marginal expansion of 8 coal power stations. The actual program
amounted to US$591 million, of which 61 % consisted of expenditures at coal power stations.
The US$64 million Bank loan financed a diverse set of goods plus a small amount of technical
assistance. A summary breakdown is as follows: Kelenfold (US$25 million), coal power stations
(US$13.7 million), other power stations (US$5 million), transmission and distribution systems
(US$17.7 million), technical assistance (US$2.6 million).
3.    The expenditures at the 8 coal power stations increased availability of capacity, improved
thermal efficiency, reduced outages and greatly reduced emissions of particulates and nitrogen
oxides. The combined-cycle co-generation unit at Kelenfold entered service at the end of 1995
with satisfactory efficiency and cost results.
4.    Technology transfer through the project was impressive.  In least-cost investment
planning, Hungarians were able not only to successfully adapt Western models but to improve
them. Up to date management information systems were also introduced.
1/    On December 31, 1991, the MVM Trust (MVMT) - the Beneficiary at Loan Signing -
was incorporated as MVM Rt. Throughout this report, the Beneficiary will be
referred to as MVM .



-11-
5.    A factor which cast a shadow on the project was the trend of demand for electricity
which, for socio-economic reasons linked to the political upheavals in and around Hungary from
1989, declined instead of increasing. This was mainly due to decreased demand by industry.
Gross electricity consumption (including station use and losses) was 36.6 TWh in 1984. At
appraisal this figure was expected to increase to about 48.2 TWh at a minimum in 1995 and to
56.5 TWh by the year 2000. The actual consumption in 1995 was only 36.4 TWh. MVM's
1995 minimum demand forecast for the year 2000 was only 37.0 TWh. Hungarian experts and
Bank staff were aware of the large potential for energy conservation in Hungary at the time of
appraisal, and the possibility of a lower than forecast demand was also considered, but not the
large reduction which occurred. Fortunately the project was fairly robust with respect to
changes in demand since it involved mainly rehabilitation. Nevertheless, the ex post rate of
return was only 6% as compared to 12% envisaged in the SAR.
6.    Another problem was that coal-generated electricity turned out to be less competitive than
expected at the time of appraisal. This led to the change in project scope described in paragraph
1, and contributed to the lower than expected project rate of return.
7.    The project was completed in its entirety but with a delay of two years on Bank financed
project components. The delay was due to the change in project scope (para. 1) and to the
Hungarian institutions' unfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement regulations and procedures.
8.    The self-financing and debt service coverage targets were met through 1994 (the last year
for which data were available on a consolidated basis). In 1994, MVM's operating costs
exceeded revenue, but no target had been fixed for these indicators. The other covenants under
the Project Agreement were met.
9.    The covenants under the Loan Agreement were mostly met. The agreement (Section
4.03 (a) (iii)) to bring producer energy prices in line with economic costs was met for most
energy products but there were a few gas and electricity price exceptions.
10.   On December 31, 1991, MVM was reorganized as a Joint Stock Limited Company with
a rationalized group of fifteen subsidiaries - eight generating companies, a transmission grid
operating company, and six distribution companies. The first revaluation of assets in three
decades was carried out in 1992. In 1994, the Act (XLVIII of 1994) on the Production,
Transport and Supply of Electric Energy was approved by Parliament. By the end of 1995, the
State Privatization and Holding Company had sold minority shares in two generation and six
distribution companies to foreign strategic investors, thus starting the program of privatization
of the power sector.
Key Lessons Learned
11.   The key lessons learned are:



-iii-
(i)    more attention should have been given at appraisal to cost comparisons between
indigenous coal and alternative energy options, including environmental costs;
(ii)  it is important to take account of the risks of actual demand turning out to be
different from forecasts, and to adjust investment programs promptly to changed
demand information;
(iii) to avoid procurement delays under international competitive bidding the Bank
should provide to new borrowers and beneficiaries detailed information on its
procurement guidelines during project preparation (the Borrower found the
subsequent preparation by the Bank of standard bidding documents helpful); and
(iv)  financial covenants should be flexible enough to ensure financial soundness of the
enterprises through periods of falling as well as increasing demand.

PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT AND EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
The Project Objectives
1.1   The project was a 7-year (1986-1992) time slice of MVM's program for reconstruction,
rehabilitation, upgrading and marginal expansion of its facilities. It included the following three
components:
(a)   Reconstruction of coal-fired thermal power stations at Gagarin (later renamed as
Matra), Ajka, Borsod, Pecs, Tiszapalkonya, Oroszlany, November 7 (later
renamed as Inota), and Tatabanya, and installation of a 60 MW turbogenerator
at Borsod (Part A of Schedule 2 of Loan Agreement);
(b)   Rehabilitation of other generating plants and rehabilitation and upgrading of the
transmission and distribution systems (Part B of Schedule 2 of Loan Agreement);
and
(c)   A program  to improve MVM's capabilities in planning, management and
operations (Part C of Schedule 2 of Loan Agreement).
The increases in generating capacity and electricity generation expected from the project were
266 MW and 2,300 GWh respectively.
1.2   The Loan Agreement Amendment of 1991 introduced the following changes in the project
due to a Government decision at the end of 1989 to shut down the uneconomic coal mine at
Borsod. They were to:
(a)   Omit the 60 MW  steam turbogenerator at Borsod and the retrofitting of the
boilers at Ajka power station to fluidized-bed combustors from Part A of the
project; and
(b)   Add construction of a gas-fired co-generation plant, capable of combined cycle
operation at the existing Kelenfold district heating power plant at Budapest. It
involved replacement of oil-fired boilers supplying steam to six existing back-
pressure turbines by a 150 MW gas turbine and a heat recovery steam generator
capable of producing 196 MW of heat.
1.3   The objectives of the project at appraisal were to:
(a)   Support the Government's strategy to increase the share of indigenous coal in
Hungary's primary energy consumption, thus saving imported oil and gas
(expected to be more expensive than indigenous coal);



-2-
(b)   Assist MVM  in conserving scarce investment capital through delaying major new
nuclear and lignite investments;
(c)   Strengthen MVM's institution building efforts;
(d)   Reduce atmospheric pollution; and
(e)   Assist in the transfer of modem technology.
Evaluation of Objectives
1.4   All the objectives except (a) were sound. The strategy of increasing the share of
indigenous coal would have been reasonable if indigenous coal had been less costly than
imported energy and if environmental pollution from coal could be kept to acceptable levels.
However, by 1989 all 8 coal companies in Hungary were in serious financial difficulties despite
government subsidies, and it was recognized that some coal mines were economically
uncompetitive. The Government then modified its coal development policy and began to
restructure the coal mining sector and shut down some uneconomic coal mines. Coal's share
in total national energy supply fell from 27.5 percent in 1985 to 16 percent in 1995.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Physical Objectives
1.5   The original project was defined as a time-slice of MVM's investment program from
1986-92. About 81% of the US$620 million program was intended for reconstruction,
rehabilitation, upgrading and marginal expansion of 8 coal power stations. The actual program
amounted to US$591 million, of which 61 % consisted of expenditures at coal power stations.
The US$64 million Bank loan financed a diverse set of goods plus a small amount of technical
assistance. A summary breakdown is as follows: Kelenfold (US$25 million), coal power stations
(US$13.7 million), other power stations (US$5 million), transmission and distribution systems
(US$17.7 million), technical assistance (US$2.6 million).
1.6   The effect of the project on available generating capacity and electricity generation is
difficult to evaluate because of the problem of determining what would have been the
performance of the coal power stations in the absence of rehabilitation and because declining
electricity demand after 1989 resulted in a reduction in load at coal power stations.
Rehabilitation increased available power capacity at Gagarin and Orozlany (which absorbed the
bulk of the rehabilitation expenditures) by 268 MW and electricity generation by 1,525 GWh
in 1992-93 compared to the years just before rehabilitation. However, available capacity fell
over the same period at the other coal power stations; generation also fell but mainly because
of lower demand for electricity from these units rather than insufficient availability. The impact
of Kelenfold is clear - an increase of 150 MW in available electric power capacity and an
increase in electricity generation estimated at 720 GWh in 1996. In addition to increasing



-3-
capacity, the project contributed to improved efficiency and reduced forced outages at the 8 coal
power stations. The average increase in thermal efficiency was about three percentage points,
which is considered to be substantial.
1.7   A major objective of the coal power station reconstruction/rehabilitation program was
to reduce the levels of NO, and particulate emissions mainly through replacement of electrostatic
precipitators and conversion to fluidized bed combustors (not financed by the Bank). NOI levels
were reduced by 30 percent. Dust levels before and after rehabilitation at three power plants
are given in the table below.
Power Plant                       Emission Levels (mg/Nm3)
Prior to Rehabilitation       Post Rehabilitation
Gagarin                     1,000                         150
Ajka                        1,900-6,300                   100-600
Pecs                        530-1,325                     100-400
1.8   The Staff Appraisal Report estimated the rate of return on the 1986-1992 time slice of
MVM's investment program at 12%. The benefits were expected to come from increased
revenue due to additional demand relative to the supply capability that would have been achieved
in the absence of rehabilitation.  An ex-post estimate of the rate of return yielded a rate of
return of only 6%, mainly because of falling electricity demand from 1989-1993. Despite this
unfavorable result, the decision to proceed with the project at the time of appraisal may still be
considered to have been largely justified based on the information available then. The timing
and severity of the fall in demand which occurred after 1989 in the wake of the fundamental
political and social changes could not have been reasonably expected at the time of project
appraisal. Moreover the original project was mainly for rehabilitation of existing capacity and
pollution control rather than construction of new capacity. However, the appraisal decision may
be faulted for overestimating the competitiveness of indigenous coal.' In addition, MVM may
have erred after 1989 in not cutting back enough on its overall investment program when it
became clear that electricity demand was falling and the cost of electricity production at some
coal power stations was high.   Further, continued operation of uncompetitive coal power
stations also contributed to the unfavorable ex-post economic rate of return. In 1991, the fuel
and operating costs (excluding investments) were about US$0.044 per kWh at Gagarin,
Oroszlany. Pecs and Tatabanya, US$0.053 at Ajka and Borsod, US$0.065 at Tiszapalkonya and
US$0.127 at November 7. Since the electricity import price in 1991 was US$0.051 per kWh,
1/ Admittedly, the evaluation was difficult since international oil prices fell sharply towards
the end of project preparation, and their future evolution was not yet clear. The Staff
Appraisal Report's analysis was based on the new lower prices.
I



-4-
and prices in subsequent years have been as low as US $0.025 per kWh, it was less costly to
import electricity than to operate the most costly coal power stations. Despite this situation
MVM was required to use more coal than would be indicated on cost grounds in order to
alleviate the painful adjustments associated with downsizing the domestic coal industry. In the
early 1990's it negotiated annual coal purchase contracts with the miners' union and the Ministry
of Industry and Trade. In 1993 and 1994 some coal mines were integrated with MVM's coal
power station companies, but MVM was still obliged to purchase some coal from independent
mines at higher prices than it paid to the integrated mines.
1.9   A separate economic analysis was made of the Kelenfold investment. The original
investment decision was justified on the grounds (i) of the urgent need to replace aged heat
supply equipment; and (ii) that the electricity component was estimated to be in the least-cost
power generation investment program as a replacement for power stations needing early
retirement. The electricity component was also considered to be economic as a means to
displace more expensive imported electricity. An ex post calculation, using actual data for the
first four months of 1996 together with actual investment costs, yielded an estimate of the cost
of incremental electricity generation at Kelenfold of 7.3 forints per kWh (US$0.052). The
operating cost (excluding investment) was estimated to be 3.4 forints per kWh (US$0.024). The
cost including investment is higher than the US$0.045 per kWh originally estimated, mainly
since the actual investment cost was 36% higher than the original estimate, but it is still
acceptable. This analysis does not take account of the benefits at Kelenfold of prolonging the
lifetime of the heat supply facilities.
Institution Building
1.10  The program to strengthen MVM's institution building efforts in planning, management
and system operations included:
(a)   a long-run marginal cost (LRMC) pricing study;
(b)   a study to develop a detailed management information system (MIS) and data
collection, recording and reporting systems (MRS);
(c)   a study to identify the major causes of quality fluctuations in coal supplies at
MVM's power stations and to ensure boiler flame stability at such power stations;
(d)   a study to develop a least cost investment strategy for further development of
power generation facilities; and
(e)   staff training, computer hardware and software and a mobile pollution monitoring
unit.
1.11  In addition, the Government agreed to complete a comprehensive study of energy prices
by January 31, 1987 and thereafter keep producer prices of fuel in line with economic costs, as



-5-
defined. This study was carried out. During the disbursement period of the project, the
Government implemented several important price reforms including freeing oil and coal prices
from controls and establishing a regulatory agency, the Hungarian Energy Office (HEO). Most
energy prices (exceptions as of June 1996 included some gas, electricity and district heat prices)
have been raised to cover economic as well as financial costs, but the process has not yet been
completed because of social considerations and concerns over inflation.
1.12 LRMC calculations were not used in the power sector in Hungary before 1987. During
1988, MVM experts, in cooperation with the Argonne National Laboratories (USA) initiated the
first LRMC study using the WASP (III) planning model. It was completed in summer 1989.
A second study was completed by MVM in February 1991, with assistance from Electricite de
France, as part of a UNDP/World Bank program of studies for European and Arab countries.
The LRMC study was updated in 1992 and in 1995.
1.13 About 20 Hungarian specialists took part in the various modelling training programs
arranged by the Bank. Not only were models suggested by the World Bank and the International
Atomic Energy Agency - WASP III - taken over successfully by MVM, they were also adapted
to suit Hungarian conditions, for example through alterations to permit evaluation of electricity
imports and combined-cycle co-generation power stations as candidates. Besides taking part
in the improvement of WASP III, MVM experts participated in development of several other
LRMC calculation and generation expansion software packages. They are now being used
routinely by MVM in its decision making. This aspect of technology transfer was particularly
impressive.
1.14 MVM selected Ontario Hydro and Price Waterhouse in 1987 for its study to develop
appropriate management information and reporting systems. Foreign consulting firms working
with MVM experts set out the fundamental basis by 1989 and thereafter introduced a working
management reporting system (MRS). During 1990-1995, the MRS was improved and
modernized. It is now being used by MVM  and its subsidiaries for technical information, stock
control, energy invoicing etc. It was able to cope with the major institutional reorganization of
1992.
1.15 The study to identify the causes of flame instability at coal-fired power stations and to
eliminate them was carried out during 1987-1988 by MVM's local consulting engineers. Some
foreign experts were also utilized for specialized services at a few important stations such as
Gagarin. The study was completed and necessary corrective steps taken.
1.16  Regarding item 1.10 (d), the WASP III model, adapted by MVM, was used for
development of a least cost investment strategy commencing in 1987. The experiences are
described in paras. 1.12 and 1.13 above.
1.17   Most of the staff training and acquisition of necessary computer hardware and software
(item 1.10 (e)) took place under the parts of the program described in paras. 1.12 and 1.13
above.

Financial Performance Objectives
1.18 The Project Agreement required MVM to (a) produce funds from internal sources
equivalent to not less than 35 percent of defined investment needs and (b) to obtain concurrence
of the Bank before incurring debt whenever its internal cash generation was not sufficient to
cover its debt service on a yearly basis at least 1.5 times in any future year. MVM met the self-
financing and debt service coverage targets through 1994 (consolidated accounts for 1995 were
not available when the ICR was prepared). However, in 1994, MVM's operating costs exceeded
revenues, and the consolidated loss after interest payments and taxes was about HUF 11.7
billion. These unfavorable results were partly due to high coal costs and a delayed adjustment
of electricity prices to inflation between 1993 and 1995. The financial covenants under the
Power Project were superseded by those of the Energy and Environment Project (Loan 3705-
HU), which became effective on April 15, 1994. Under this project the self-financing target
was increased to 55 % and an operating ratio covenant was added. Because of continued reform
and privatization of the power sector, new financial covenants are expected to be introduced
under the proposed Quick Start Gas Turbine Project, which will replace those under the Energy
and Environment Project.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
1. 19 The major factors which affected the project were: (i) the major political and social
changes in Central Europe in the late 1980s; (ii) the associated decline in the demand for
electricity after 1989; and (iii) Government's decision in 1990 to reduce coal mining - a radical
modification of its previous policy of increasing the role of coal in the country's energy
consumption. The election of a non-communist government in Hungary in 1990 was followed
by the preparation of a new energy policy, restructuring of the energy sector, including MVM,
and a major initiative to privatize the energy sector companies. MVM's decision to request a
reallocation of funds under the Power Project to finance the Kelenfold combined-cycle unit was
due to the changed policy environment.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
1.20  The rehabilitated coal power generating units, except Matra, are expected to be retired
by soon after the year 2000, in line with expectations at the time of appraisal. Matra's lifetime
is expected to be longer: the attractiveness of this plant is evidenced by its sale to a foreign
strategic investor in 1995. Kelenfold's sustainability is probably assured by its high thermal
efficiency, low operating costs and secure supply of natural gas. Since the project was defined
as a time-slice of MVM's investment program, the question of sustainability really applies to the
whole power system. The power system's prospects are favorable due to the restructuring and
continuing privatization of the power sector and establishment of a new regulatory framework.
Membership in the Union for the Coordinated Production of Electricity (UCPTE) will also help
to ensure a continued high quality and reliability of electricity supply.

E. BANK PERFORMANCE
1.21 Bank performance can be considered satisfactory. The Bank maintained good working
relations with the Borrower, the Beneficiary and its consultants throughout. The Bank displayed
flexibility in resolving problems that arose on redefining the scope of the project when earlier
assumptions on coal availability, quality and costs were found to be wrong and required a change
in Government energy policy.
1.22 Delays occurred in the early years of the project in procurement of major equipment
through ICB - such as procurement of the 60 MW turbogenerator at Borsod. It took almost
three years for preparation of satisfactory bidding documents - too late to be issued! The delays
were primarily due to the unfamiliarity of the implementing agencies and their local consultants
with ICB procedures, but also to the inadequate efforts by the Bank staff to anticipate and
overcome the problems efficiently. In retrospect, it would have been better to familiarize the
Borrower and the Beneficiary in detail with the procurement procedures of the Bank during
project preparation.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
1.23. The project components were implemented by MVM and in the later stage by enterprises
separated from MVM proper. Their performance was commendable since they successfully
carried out the project during a period of major political and economic transition.  Since this
was the first Bank-financed power project, the implementation agencies were not familiar with
Bank practice, particularly on procurement. However, through the project implementation, the
implementing agencies gained substantial experience in international procurement. The credit
for the successful execution of the project as a whole is due to the organizational skill and
commitment of MVM's Directorate of Development. Through the project, MVM absorbed not
only modern construction and operation techniques for thermal power units, but also greatly
strengthened its organization.  During project implementation MVM  established in-house
capacity to develop the least-cost investment plans for power generation on a regular basis. The
unit was also active internationally, and contributed to improvements in the WASP III model,
which were accepted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The efforts towards
increasing internal efficiency in all parts of MVM were successful. MVM needs to be
commended for its role in the implementation of the reconstruction/rehabilitation program.
MVM has also made an important contribution by altering the project to fit new circumstances
through successfully introducing combined cycle co-generation technology into the Hungarian
energy system.
1.24 The performance of the Borrower was also satisfactory. It was highly commendable in
major policy matters such as the shutting down of uneconomic domestic coal mines, initiation
of privatization of the electricity subsector, and establishment of a regulatory framework. The
Borrower permitted sufficient electricity price increases to allow MVM to meet the financial
covenants under the project; however, these did not prevent MVM from incurring a financial
loss in 1994.

G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
1.25    The physical objectives were achieved and the power stations and systems are operating
satisfactorily. The technical assistance component of the project contributed to acquiring modern
means of system planning and economic pricing, improving the firing conditions of boilers using
poor quality domestic coal, and improving environmental monitoring. The institutional capacity
building effort was particularly effective. However, largely because of a steep fall in electricity
demand that could not have been reasonably expected at the time of appraisal, the project
economic rate of return was only 6 %. In addition some of the rehabilitated coal power stations
have high operating costs because of low thermal efficiency and high coal costs. Overall, the
project outcome is rated as satisfactory.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
1.26  The Project was followed in 1994 by the Energy and Environment Project (Loan 3705-
HU), which provides for a major expansion of the combined cycle co-generation program,
started under the first power project. It involves: (a) construction of a 235 MWe and 240 MWt
cogeneration unit at Dunamenti, (b) upgrading of MVM's existing Energy Management System
(EMS), (c) technical assistance aimed at reinforcing the environment management and
monitoring capabilities of MVM, and (d) upgrading MVM's training and institutional-building
capacity in the power sector. The Quick Start Gas Turbine Project is expected to be negotiated
in late 1996 or early 1997. It would involve the construction of 2xO1 0 MW gas turbines to
provide secondary reserve for the power system. Continued Bank assistance will help MVM
to develop an effective approach to pollution control in the electricity subsector and strengthen
its institutional capabilities to address environmental issues. The power generating and
distributing companies which benefited from the investments under the project have been
separated from MVM and are being privatized. The Hungarian Energy Office has been
established to provide regulatory supervision. These actions are considered to be sufficient to
provide for satisfactory future operations.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
1.27  The key lessons learned are:
(i)    more attention should have been given at appraisal to cost comparisons between
indigenous coal and alternative energy options, including environmental costs;
(ii)  it is important to take account of the risks of actual demand turning out to be different
from forecasts, and to adjust investment programs promptly to changed demand
information;
(iii) to avoid procurement delays under international competitive bidding the Bank should
provide to new borrowers and beneficiaries detailed information on it sprocurement



-9-
guidelines during project preparation (the Borrower found the subsequent preparation by
the Bank of standard bidding documents helpful); and
(iv)  financial covenants shoule be flexible enough to ensure financial soundness of the
enterprises through periods of falling as well as increasing demand.

Since this is the first power sector loan to Hungary, there are no Bank loans that fall
into this category. In the larger Energy Sector, the Industrial Energy Diversification and
Conservation Project (Loan 2317-HU of 1983), which aimed at economic substitution of
domestic energy resources through a switch from oil towards domestic coal, was a related
loan.

Notes
1.   All incremental revenue and cost estimates measure changes
with respect to 1987 levels, except for fuel costs, for which the
base year was taken as 1988.   The year 1987 was the last year
before rehabilitation had an impact.  Ideally the increments should
measure  changes  with  respect  to  estimates  with  and  without
rehabilitation. However, estimates of what would happen in the
absence of rehabilitation are very speculative.    The without
rehabilitation estimates made at the time of appraisal could not be
used since the figures for available capacity and generation of
coal   power   stations   exceeded   the   actual   results   after
rehabilitation. The year 1988 was chosen as the base year for fuel
costs  for  two  reasons.    First,  the  improvements  in  thermal
efficiency at the rehabilitated coal power stations came mostly
after 1988. Second, since the Paks nuclear power station reached
full operation during 1988, by selecting that year as base year it
was possible to avoid including in the benefits of the project fuel
cost reductions attributable to Paks.
2.   The investment estimates for the years 1986 through 1992 are
actuals.   The estimates for the years 1993 through 1996 are the
actuals for Kelenfold only.
3.   Fuel costs, 0 & M costs and imports were assumed to grow from
the 1995 level at the same rate as forecast sales.
4.   The large negative number shown in the investment row for the
year 2000 is a measure of the year 2000 value of the net benefits
of the investments for the remainder of their lifetimes, assuming
a 12% rate of return.  In order to be consistent with the Staff
Appraisal Report estimates, the same ratio of value to investments
was selected as was estimated in that report.
5.   The estimates are given in 1995 prices in order to facilitate
comparison  with  the  Staff  Appraisal  Report  estimates.    An
interesting finding revealed by this approach is that actual
average electricity prices throughout the disbursement period of
the project turned out to be about equal to those forecast at
appraisal - about 2 forints per kWh.

Implementation Completion Report
(Short form)
on the Power Project financed on the basis of Loan Agreement of HU-2697 between the (People's)
Republic of Hungary and the Intemational Bank for Reconstruction and Development and implemented
by MVM Rt. (former MVMT).
Budapest, June 1996
Prepared by:
MVM Rt.
Development Directorate
1.    INTRODUCTION
The Hungarian Power Companies Ltd. was founded on 1 September 1963 on the basis of Resolution
No. 10154/1963. (IV. 2.) of Economic Committee by Foundation Resolution No. 667/1963. (63. VIII.
28.) of the Minister of Heavy Industry.
The monopoly of the Hungarian Electricity Trust was of nearly exclusive in the electricity industry as it
had the right to direct 11 power plants accounting for the major part the electricity generation capacity,
the 6 electricity supply companies distributing the power in their local districts, the National Power Grid
Company operating the transmission grid, transmitting the high voltage electricity and providing
intemational connections and the 4 service companies serving the whole power system, supporting the
operation and development of the above mentioned companies and perfofming other services.
Besides electricity supply, the district heat supply is also a significant activity, carried out in the region
of certain power plants. The two-third of district heat supply in Hungary was provided by MVMTs power
plants.
Over the period with the trust organisation the following activities belonged to MVMT: (1) production -
including all the activity connected to the generation units - (2) transmission on the basic network
(grid), distibution - including the distribution network and all the associated activity and (3) the
consumer services. MVMT (i) directed through its intemal regulatory system; (ii) provided for the
continuos supply of electricity and (iii) managed the investment funds allocated for power plants
and the network and made decisions (except constructing new generating capacities).
The operation of MVMT was based on Act IV of 1962 on the Generation, Transmission and Distribution
of Electricity and regarding economic aspects the direct state control was determinant. MVMT made
every effort in its power to satisfy consumers' demands both in quantity and quality. The funds deemed
necessary were provided by the govemment through budgetary channels. These funds determined the
possibilities of development (wages and salaries) and, occasionally, also the strategy of operation.
In the 80s several power plants working under the management of MVMT became over-aged, the
technical standard became obsolete, they were in need of reconstruction or replacement. Based on the
investigations carried out according to different considerations, decisions were made on the
reconstruction of the coal fired power plants to ensure an adequate and continuos supply of electricity
at a satisfactory standard of service until new capacities were put into operation. Due to reduced
development funds and the fact that the equipment, materials and parts could only be procured through
imports from the industrialised countries there was a need for convertible financial funds. At that time
Hungary joined to the World Bank. This made it possible to take out a World Bank loan for the partial
financing from a reliable source of the up-to-date reconstruction of the power plants, called the Power
Project. This was also supported by the decisions of the Hungarian Govemment Authorities.

2.    PROJECT PRELIMINARIES
The reconstruction of the coal fired power plants - the Power Project - mentioned in the Introduction
was a chance of development in the power industry that was in line with the concepts of the World
Bank. Using a World Bank loan for the reconstruction raised the funds still missing for the financing of
the project, making it easier to buy modem parts and equipment from the industrialised countries.
In addition to the reconstruction of the power plants the World Bank accepted the improvement of the
technical level of the power sector and the rehabilitation of the old machinery a development sub-
project justified for being financed partly or in the whole from World Bank funds.
After preparatory activities lasting about one and a half years, the Loan Agreement between the
Hungarian People's Republic (Borrower)- and the Intemational Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (the Bank) and simultaneously the 'Project Agreement" between the Bank and the
Hungarian Electric Power Trust were signed on 17 June 1986.
3.    THE LOAN AND THE PROJECT
3.1    Characteristics of the Loan Agreement
The Loan Agreement dated 17 June 1986 was concluded between the Hungarian People's Republic
(Borrower) and the Intemational Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank): Its title is:
Power Project, No. HU-2697. The project was implemented by the Hungarian Electricity Trust (MVMT).
On the same day the so called Project Agreement was concluded between the Bank and MVMT and on
31 July 1986 the so called Subsidiary Loan Agreement was concluded between the Hungarian People's
Republic and the Hungarian Electricity Trust and that Agreement, or rather Contract, constitutes an
inseparable part of the Loan Agreement.
The characteristics of the three contracts are:
a)    A Loan Agreement between the Hungarian People's Republic and Intemational Bank for
Reconstruction and Development;
al)   The sum of the Loan Agreement is USD 64,000,000,- (say sixty-four million US dollars); to be
disbursed from quarter IV of 1986, with a term of 15 years and a grace period of three years
within this term;
a2)   The commitment fee is 3/4 % per annum on the unused part of the principal amount of the
Loan and the interest is to be calculated on basis of the principal amount of the Loan disbursed
and still outstanding with an interest rate equal to the Costs of Qualified Borrowings +1/2 % per
annum.
a3)   Closing Date: (originally 31 March 1993 then, after the modifications) 31 March 1995;
a4)   Repayment is done over the period from 15 February 1990 until 15 August 2001 cn the 15
February and 15 August of each year according to the Amortisation Schedule (Annex 1).
b)    A Project Agreement between the Intemational Bank for Reconstruction and Development and
Hungarian Electricity Trust (MVM Rt.);
b1)   The date of this agreement corresponds to that of the Loan Agreement;
b2)   The agreement was concluded with the same terms and conditions as the Loan Agreement;
b3)   MVM Rt. assumed the obligation to realise the project with proper care and efficiency.
c)    A Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Hungarian People's Republic and Hungarian
Electricity Trust (MVM Rt.):
c1)   The Subsidiary Loan Agreement is an inseparable part of the Loan Agreement;
c2)   The Hungarian (People's) Republic re-lent in forints (HUF) the World Bank loan to MVMT within
the framework of this Subsidiary Loan Agreement under the same terms and conditions as in
the Loan Agreement:

c3)   The Hungarian (People's) Republic entered into commissioning contract on the whole (i) foreign
completion of the project - with the Hungarian National Bank then (ii) domestic financial
management with the Budapest Bank Rt. (The assignment of Budapest Bank as a commercial
bank was concluded as a result of the introduction of the two-tier banking system.)
3.2    Sub-projects
The project consist of the following parts that can be modified from time to time by agreement between
the Bank and Borrower to meet the objectives of the Project:
Part A:
The reconstruction of eight coal fired power stations;
Part B:
Rehabilitation of MVM Rt's (MVMrs) other generating plants and upgrading MVM Rt's (MVMTs)
transmission and distribution systems;
Part C:
The improvement of MVM Rt's (MVMT's) capability in planning, management and system operation.
3.3    The Allocation of the Loan
The allocation of the loan amount according to each categories:
(1) Turbogenerator for the Borsod Power Plant               USO 8,000,000
(2) Other goods and materials                              USD 50,400,000
(3) Technical assistance (consultant services and training)  USO 1,000,000
(4) Unallocated                                             USD 4,600,000
Total:                                                  USO 64,000,000
At the end of 1989 a decision was made to stop the Borsod Turbogenerator Project due to the
uncertainty in the coal supply to Borsod Power Plant and the uneconomic generation of the
condensation type power in the power plant; bids to be financed from the Loan could not be invited and
further procurement- had to be stopped. The unused (undisbursed) part of the Loan was reallocated to
the Kelenfdld Gas-turbine Project.
After this reallocating, the categories were modified as follows:
(1) Budapest Power Plant . Kelenfold Power Station         USD 25,000,000
(2) Other goods and materials                              USD 35,660,000
(3) Consultant's services and training                      USO 2,834,000
(4) Unallocated                                               uso 500,000
Total:                                                  USo 64,000,000
4. THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
4.1   Forecast of electricity demands
Over the almost one decade passed since conclusion of the Loan Agreement the forecasts of
demand trends on the development of Hungarian electricity system have been reviewed and revised
several times. The demand trend forecasts prepared in 1986, 1989, 1989 and 1995 and sent to the



- 24 -
APPENDIX
Page 4 of 23
World Bank' are highly different from each other and predict an increasingly moderate rise in the
demand (Annex 3 - figures 1 and 2). The very big differences between the demand trend forecasts are
basically due to the great economic-social transformation and changes of economy structure that
started in 1988-89 and that have been in progress since then.
The estimate of electricity demand included in the Staff Appraisal Report and serving as a
basis for the taking out of the Loan was prepared by the Ministry of Industry in co-operation with the
Central Planning Bureau. The forecast was reviewed by the World Bank (report no. 5585-HU) and was
considered as well based and acceptable. These forecasts predicted an annual increase of 3.3 % in
gross electricity consumption for the period between 1985 and 1990.
The forecasts in 1989 (least cost power plant investment project, June 1989) calculated with a
much moderate rise in the overall demand. The long term forecast of electricity demand included in the
study titled 'Preliminary system analysis of the extension of the Hungarian power plant system' sent to
the World Bank already took into consideration the very significant drop of demand due to the
economic changes commenced in 1988-89. A common characteristic of the estimates in 1992 was that
they calculated with a rise in demand trend after 1995 and estimated a practically unchanged demand
trend between 1992 and 1995.
(Annex 3 - Figures 1 and 2 give a summary view of forecasts made in different times /in 1986, 1989,
1992 and 1995/ regarding the trend of gross electricity demands at system level and peak power
demands at system level.)
4.2    Energy policy, energy strategy
In the period between 1986 and 1995, due to the economic, social and political processes and
changes that began in the country, the policy and partly even the objectives of the energy policy and
energy strategy have significantly changed. At the time of the taking out of the Loan the main
objectives of the energy policy and the means to achieve them were summarized in report No. 5927-
HU (Hungary Staff Appraisal Report - Power Project, 23 April 1986). A part of the changes in the
Hungarian energy policy of the 90s can be related to the economic processes going on in the country
and to the changes in the world economy. The most important change occurred in the demand trend. At
the end of the 80s the decrease in energy demands began in each field resulting from the reduction of
consumption and of industrial production determining energy consumption. The absolute and relative
decrease of primary energy production and, as a result, the increased dependence on energy imports
became a trend. Sirpultaneously with the decrease of energy demands also the forecasts of long term
energy demand (energy consumption) became more and more moderate (see Annex 4).
Within the Hungarian electricity consumption the rate and volume of the imported electricity
dropped significantly. Whilst in 1986 the volume of the imported electricity was 10516 GWh accounting
for 27.5 % of the total consumption, in 1994 these values were 2034 GWh and 5.7 %, respectively.
Although system-level electricity demands dropped from 40 TWh to 35 TWh between 1989 and 1994,
the electricity generation of the domestic power plants increased more than ever, in 1994 32693 GWh,
compared to the 28647 GWh produced in the year of the maximum demand. The increase in the
domestic electricity production was a consequence of the major decrease of rate and absolute volume
of the imported electricity.
The economic recession and the gradual conversion of the price system of the energy carriers -
going on even at present - resulted in a major price rise of the energy caniers and the changes of price
ratios. By the early 90s it became clear, that the domestic brown coal mining and most of the mining
companies were permanently producing losses, and the brown coal produced was not competitive

compared with the imported hard coal either in short term or in long term. In 1990 the govemment set
up the Center for the Restructuring of Coal Mining (SZISZEK) with the task of gradually cut back coal
mining in accordance with the long term objectives of the energy policy. Within the framework of this
project a part of the domestic coal mines were closed down, some were integrated in power plant
companies and others were allowed to continue their operations for a limited period. The cut back of
electricity production on brown coal basis was justified by the stricter environment protection
regulations, too.
The comerstones of the development plan of the Hungarian power plant system in the mid-
eighties were the improvement plans of the Paks nuclear power plant, the reconstruction of the coal
based electricity production capacity and the expansion of the Dunamenti Power Plant with a combined
cycle unit. In the long term power plant construction project of 1989, already based on the system-wide
optimization program, the expansion of the Hungarian system with further nuclear power plant units and
with lignite fired base load power plant units was - partly due to the modifications in demand forecasts -
postponed, and the reconstruction project of coal fired power plants was stopped at this time. This
power plant construction project of least total cost envisaged the commercial operation of the combined
cycle power plant units to be constructed in the Dunamenti Power Plant by 1993 and the proposed gas
turbine expansion in the Kelenfold Power plant by 1992.
In the least cost power plant construction strategy prepared in 1992 the fluidized-bed firing
power plant units planned to be installed at existing power plant sites (Borsod Power Plant 80 MW,
Inota Power Plant 150 MW, Pecs Power Plant 80 MW, Matra Power Plant 150 MW) and to run on
imported hard coal fuel were new elements as compared with the earlier strategies. The program also
included the construction of a power plant unit for the firing of heavy residue fuel oil with greater unit
capacity (450 MW) as part of the so called high demand scenario. The program assumed a highly
reduced (300 MW, 1800 GWh) electricity import and counted upon the connection to the UCPTE. (For
detail see MVM Rt's Implementation Completion Report.)
4.3    Energy Prices (Tariff Policy)
General analysis
In principle, the production and consumer prices of the energy carriers were in harmony up to
the first oil price explosion in 1972.
Subsequently, basically due to social policy considerations, the consumer prices lagged behind the
level of production prices.
From 1983,. in their letters of intent given to the World Bank, the successive Hungarian
governments agreed to increase the consumer prices and asked for a postponement up to 1995 to
complete these actions. The World Bank noted the delay but with the reservation that up to 1992 all
state subsidiaries to consumer prices should be discontinued. This obligation was fulfilled. Since 1992
no state subsidiary is included in the household consumer prices.
The ongoing devaluation of the forint after 1992 continued to increase the difference between
the free market prices of the energy carriers and the fixed prices of the line-transported energy sources
in such a way, that the production prices were always adjusted, while the consumer prices were not.
Price adiustments uD to 1994
Global price adjustment was made in 1990 and only minor other price rises took place during
the investigation period.
Until to 31 December 1996 the determination of the highest official price (tariff) and the
conditions of its application were regulated by Act LXXXVII of 1990.
In 1993 a VAT of 10 % was introduced.
The production and consumer prices of the now officially priced energy carriers and the price
adjustments in the electricity sector carried out since 1 November 1990 are shown in Annex 5.

APPENDIX
Page 6 of 23
Since 1992 the majority of the group companies makes losses and the high loss of HUF 10.8
billion in 1994 clearly shows the need for price rises. The mostly loss-making tariff groups are the
household, the railway traction and the public lighting tariffs. The maximized official prices of heat
production did not cover the costs of production and supply, not even at the time they came into effect.
The corporation believes the main cause of loss-making operation is the failure to rise the
prices and to restructure the tariffs.
The Govemment increased the official price of the electricity several times since 1995 but
these corrected the existing problems only marginally. The Govemment partially raised the price of
electricity in September 1995 and in March 1996 to comply with its obligations towards the World Bank.
According to Govemment Decree No. 1074/1995 (VIII. 4.) cost-based prices should be determined by
October 1996 and should be maintained starting January 1997.  (For details see MVM  Rt's
Implementation Completion Report.)
5.    IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT
5.1 Procurements
The funds for the most important imports from industrialised countries were provided by the
World Bank Loan Agreement and the Project Agreement. Within the framework of the World Bank
Loan Agreement and the Project Agreement supporting the reconstruction program of the power plants
and the expansion of the lifetime of the power plants and the electrical networks the most important
imports from the industrialised countries were allowed to be acquired exclusively by bid invitations
according to the World Bank procurement rules. These regulations were significantly stricter than those
used in the former traditional foreign trading practice.
In addition to the more effective business management, a new way of thinking in technical and
trading issues and a new practice of procurements was required by the bidding procedure. The general
experience was the price level of the bids received for bid invitations issued according to the World
Bank rules was far more advantageous than the contract price level achieved through the conventional
foreign trade practice. Thus, nowadays this method is used more widely, consciously utilising the
stimulating effect of consistent foreign trading operations with strict rules and of systemizing.
After the initial difficulties, a period of about one and a half years, using the prepared and
approved standardNdocuments valid for the various types of procurement, the procurement process was
used in a relatively quick. manner and the set deadlines were met.
5.2 Part A - Reconstruction of Coal Fired Power Plants
Preliminaries, Introduction
The objective of the reconstruction of the coal fired power plants financed from the World Bank
loan was to increase the rate of coal within the use of domestic fuel to the detriment of gas and oil and
to delay the major investments in power plants, due to lack of capital, by developing certain capacity
surplus. Moreover, the reconstruction should result in a system of up-to-date, reliable and efficient
components; the equipment and facilities to be reconstructed should meet the technical level prevailing
at the time of their reconstruction. A major objective of the reconstruction was also that the main and
auxiliary equipment of the power plant could reliably operate for another 15 to 20 years.
The program made also great efforts - taking into consideration the financial possibilities of the
given period of time, too - to decrease the adverse effects of the coal fired power plants to the
environment.
Regarding the power plants, the development projects based on the World Bank Loan mainly
related to ongoing reconstruction projects and to those under preparation, as well as to upgrading and
rehabilitation programs.

APPENDIX
Page 7 of 23
At those times of foreign currency shortage it was a great chance for the power plants that in
addition to replacing the main equipment stipulated in their reconstruction program, they could get the
equipment for the auxiliary facilities, too, by the help of imports within a given technical limit.
Supplementary equipment of power plant technology, control instruments, machinery and tools and also
the necessary amount of spare parts enabling the continuous reliability have been purchased within the
framework of this program.
Procurement for the reconstruction of coal fired power plants
The funds for the procurement for the reconstruction of MVMT's power stations of Gagarn,
Ajka, Borsod, Pecs, Tiszapalkonya, Oroszlany, November 7 and Tatabanya   including the
reconstruction of boilers, the reconstruction and repowerng of turbines and generators, the installation
of a 60 MW turbogenerator, the replacement of high pressure pipes, valves, pumps, insulation material
and control equipment for boilers, turbines and generators, the rehabilitation and replacement of
electrostatic precipitators, the installation of desulphurization units and the rehabilitation of heat
exchangers, coal handling and auxiliary equipment were provided from categories 1 and 2 of the World
Bank Loan.
Due to a change of concept, the Borsod turbogenerator has fallen out. Thus, the categories
were reallocated as described in Chapter 3 'The Loan and the Project".
The allocation of the actual procurement items by companies and types of equipment is shown
in Annex 6.
5.3    Part B - Procurement by the Electricity Supply Companies and other Companies
Within the framework of sub project 'Modemisation and reconstruction' of Loan no. 2697-HU,
further to the power plants that had been reconstructed, the technical-technological modemisation and
rehabilitation of two other power plants, the power generating, transmitting and distribution systems of
the electricity supply companies of the Hungarian electricity system and other servicing companies
have been effected. This included the overhaul and/or procurement of boilers, turbines and spare parts
for generators, valves, instruments, auxiliary equipment, protection and remote control devices,
machines and tools, laboratory equipment, computer components, insulators and switchgears.
The World Bank loan was used to
purchase machinery and tools for;
increase the safety of;
modemise the operation and maintenance technology of; and
speed up the trouble shooting of
the networks and equipment of the MVM Rt., the Dunamenti and the Budapesti Power Plants, the
electricity supply, service, design and engineering companies DlDASZ, EMASZ, TITASZ, ERBE,
EROKAR, OVIT, VERTESZ, i.e. of the Hungarian electricity system.
This way these companies were able to increase the efficiency of their work, provide modem
working conditions, meet the increased safety rules in the installation operations, as well as to procure
spare parts for the imported equipment.
Within the framework of the program the companies purchased universal construction
machinery and tools, cranes, trucks, railway and road trailers, bulldozers, grabs, tools for work with live
circuits, tools for electric cable installation, a measuring van for location of cable fault, an
environmental measuring van, portable calibrating and control instruments, spare parts, etc.
The purchases of the companies are shown in Annex 6.

5.4    Part C - Technical Assistance (Consultant and other services)
The purpose of the technical assistance consisting of consultant services and computer
hardware and software purchases is that the MVM should be able to expand its planning, controlling
and operating activities and improve its environment protection activity.
Twenty contracts have been concluded for implementing the sub-project, a part of which was of
study character, another part aimed at elaboration of management and organisation systems through
consulting. In addition, experts were instructed within the framework of training on site and in study
tours abroad, as well as in the form of participating in intemational conferences.
MVM Rt. has implemented the following in the framework of this sub-project:
(i) a long run marginal cost (LRMC) pricing study;
(ii) a study to develop a detailed management information system (MIS) and data collection, recording
and reporting system (MRS);
(iii) a study to develop a least cost investment strategy for further development of power generation
facilities;
(iv) a study to identify the major causes of quality fluctuation in coal supplies at MVM Rt's power
stations and to ensure boiler flame stability at such power stations;
(v) staff training, computer hardware and software and a mobile pollution monitoring unit; and
(vi) an energy pricing study.
The use of World Bank Loan for Technical Assistance (consultant and other services) is shown in
Annex 7.
6.     RECONSTRUCTION OF KELENFOLD POWER PLANT
The preparation of the reconstruction of the Kelenfold Power Plant, a part of Budapest Power
Plant, began in 1989. The Investment Program (for the reconstruction, a sub-project of Power Project)
was approved by Budapest Power Plant Co. in 1993. The reconstruction was implemented on the basis
of this Investment Program also accepted by the Worid Bank.
The investment cost of the Program is the following:

Results of the reconstruction
The following units have been installed during reconstruction:
-   PG 9171 type gas turbine of 137 MW capacity, manufactured by General Electric;
-   A 09157 TS type generator of 156,5 MVA capacity, manufactured by ELIN;
-   Heat recovery steam generator with a thermal capacity of 196,5 MW, manufactured by Austrian
Energy Environment, together with a stack of 82 m height;
-   Main transformer of 180 MVA, 132/15,75 kV, manufactured by Ganz Ansaldo;
Additionally other related elements to serve the above mentioned main parts such as buildings,
high pressure (60 bar) natural gas pipeline between Szazhalombatta and the power plant for the fuel
supply to the has turbine, natural gas receiving station, oil pipeline, 2 pcs of oil tanks, provided with
double wall and floating cover and with a capacity of 2000 m3 each, steam- and hot water pipelines of
40 bar, 120 kV cable between the unit and the network substation.
The project was implemented according to the time schedule in 1994. The on-site erection
works were finished by June 1995 and operational tests started. The planned commissioning of the
gasturbine was delayed by the public protest against the construction of the high-pressure gas pipeline.
The gas supply commenced on 19 October 1995. The trial run was completed on 23 December 1995
and the unit was commissioned. The contractors completed the service systems according to the time
schedule. The Transelektro Company - who was responsible for the modemisation of the water
treatment equipment - was in a six-months delay but this did not delay the commissioning of the unit.
Environment-Drotection
To get authority permits an audited laboratory had to be hired to measure the emission of air
pollutants and noise level. The result of measurements in both cases confirmed that the gasturbine unit
operates within the specified emission limits. Because of the lower emission of air pollutants the
environmental condition of the Kelenfold Power Plant and its neighbourhood improved significantly.
Operation
The equipment running since 23 December 1995 are operated at a proper way by the
operators.
Summary
The new section of the Power Plant implemented under the reconstruction program has taken
over the production from the old plant, i.e. the major part of the of the production has been transferred
to the new unit. Four steam boilers were shut down in the old power plant. The new power plant section
works at a constant load during the heating season and on partial load during the off-heating season.
7.    REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ISSUES
The statements and the evaluation indicate current prices.
7.1    Financial situation over the loan period
The assets of the company increased from HUF 153 thousand million in 1985 to HUF 682
thousand million by the end of 1994. An amount of HUF 413 thousand million of the increase of HUF
529 thousand million is due to the assets revaluation with effect of 1 January 1992.
The increase in the assets was mainly financed from own funds. The debt ratio increased from
4 % in 1985 to 5 %.

7.2    Business results
The business results of MVM Rt. truly reflect the negative stagflation processes taking place in
Hungary.
-   Over the perod between 1985 and 1990, MVM Rt. operated under a special income regulation; the
state left every year a minimum profit for the company in case of the fulfilment of annually set
indices and the rest was withheld by the state in the form of a differential tumover tax of producers
(KUTEFA with Hungarian initials).
-   This special regulation was cancelled as from 1991 and MVM was governed by the general
business regulations.
-   From 1989 the costs considerably increased due to the inflation, but these effects could not be
recognised in the prices.
Due to these changes the financial situation of the Companies began to deteriorate from 1992.
Consequently, the financing of their operation required an increasing amount of loans. The interests
caused by the high rate of inflation resulted in a further increase of costs, thus the balance sheet of the
Company Group has indicated a loss since 1992.
7.3    Available funds and their utilisation
Over the years 1986-1995, funds totalling to HUF 352 thousand million were available to the
Company Group.
Out of this figure, the intemal funds represented HUF 227 thousand million (65 %); HUF 58.5 thousand
million (16 %) resulted from funds received from the state and consumers' contributions, and HUF 66
thousand million (19 %) from loans.
HUF 253 thousand million, i.e. 70 % of the funds were used for investments and for the
increase of working capital.
The fulfilment of obligations conceming the payment of taxes and dividends required HUF 42
thousand million (12 %), and the debt service needed HUF 47 thousand million (13 %).
7.4    Fulfilment of financial forecasts indicated in the loan assessment report of the World
Bank
A comparison with the financial forecasts is complicated by the significant changes in
accountancy regulations implemented several times during the crediting period in the years 1988 and
1992), and also the assets were revaluated in 1992.
In order to facilitate the comparison, certain adjustments were made.
The profit according to the balance sheet of MVM company group, summarised for the period
considered, is by HUF 34 thousand million lower than the amount indicated in the financial forecast.
The main reasons for this lower figure are as follows:
The Revenues exceed those indicated in the forecast by HUF 74 thousand million.
- the electricity sold dropped by 24.8 TWh due to a setback in the consumption for production
purposes,
- although the average price of electricity was higher than the forecast value, nevertheless, it did not
follow the rate of inflation;
- the increase of incomes from other activities - mainly from heat sales - fell behind the rate of
increase of expenditures.



- 31 -
APPENDDIX
Page 11 of 23
The increase in Expenditures exceeded the planned figures by HUF 190 thousand million -
higher than that in the revenues. The three main reasons are:
- The rate of inflation was higher than expected.
- Two unplanned cost components, i.e. the amount of HUF 33.2 thousand million of Paks capital
allowance (repayment), and of HUF 60 thousand million of the Differential Tumover Tax of
Producers;
The costs of depreciation were by HUF 18 thousand million higher than the projected figure, mainly
resulting from the assets revaluation that took place in 1992. The revaluation was mainly caused by
settling the power plant reconstruction to the charge of production expenditures until 1986, and it
was indicated in the books without vaflue. During the assets appraisal with effect of 1 January 1992,
the value of this equipment was defined under consideration of the remaining period of service life
and the reproduction costs.
The deterioration of HUF 116 thousand million in Operating Profit was positively
counterbalanced by the lower level of interests, taxes and dividends than that planned. It produced a
profit increase of HUF 73 thousand million.
Taking the above facts into consideration, the retained profit decreased by HUF 34 thousand
million, as compared with the planned figure.
The financial indices are shown in the Annex No.3 of MVM Rt's Implementation Completion
Report (see Tables M3/10-M3/1 1). It should be noted that the value of all indices is within the range
required by the World Bank.
8.     EXPERIENCE DURING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
MVM Rt. and its group companies proceeded according to the investment instructions strictly
stipulated in the period of taking out the Wortd Bank Loan. The extraordinary limited extent of imports
from the West and the limited capacity of the Hungarian manufacturing and installation companies did
not allow the use of modem investment procurement methods. Consequently, neither MVM Rt. nor the
other companies had such kind of experence. MVMT was put into a direct borrower position through
the World Bank Loan, thus obtaining experience conceming effective decision making mechanisms
used in market economy.
The specialists of the branch had therefore the possibility:
- to leam the techniques of investment assessments,
- to get acquainted with bidding methods and to exercise them,
- to get acquainted with modem planning methods.
8.1    Reconstruction of coal fired power stations
The organisation and management of reconstruction in coal fired power stations took place in
different ways at each plant, depending on the different character of technical objectives to be
achieved. In spite of this fact, the single jobs were generally ordered by the power stations themselves,
while the most significant orders were prepared and managed by ERBE (the investment company of
MVMT).
The investment activity of the entire reconstruction period practically followed the practice and
common law applied in Hungary. This means that the various generat contracting methods were not
applied, partly because the technical tasks fulfilled during reconstruction were excessively split and
consisted of locally performed partial activities. The use of any new method would have been too risky
given the lack of experience. Therefore, the jobs were implemented in a form used in the Hungarian
practice, through a general co-ordination performed by the investor, with the involvement of general
designers and general contractors.



- 32 -
APPENDIX
Page 12 of 23
However, some general contracting agreements were concluded during this period for certain
well-specified jobs, where the supplier assumed a performance responsibility and was accountable for
guarantee and quality.
Considering the above, the experience gained during the reconstruction program can be
summarised as follows:
- there was no power station construction during the reconstruction period - apart from the investment
of Paks Nuclear Power Station -, thus the experience gained here can be utilised for the construction
program of new power stations (in bidding, general contracting, etc.). Regarding the procurement of
equipment, the knowledge related to contracting and bidding defined and collected according to
World Bank guidelines can be utilised; -
- it became obvious that the issues of required quality, time schedule of implementation, price and
responsibility can only be satisfactorily ensured by a project approach and that project
implementation works out only in the form of general contracting.
8.2    Procurement
The experience gained during the procurement procedure performed by ERBE can be
summarised as follows:
* the experience gained during the management of intemational bidding procedure under Loan No.
2697-HU can be used more favourably in the procurement procedures under the further loans;
- the time necessary for the own work within the procurement process should be shortened, resulting
in costs saving;
- through the use of the World Bank recommendations taken over during the preparation of the
contract conditions and the regular consultations canied out with World Bank experts, Bidding
Documents are already prepared in a form which, combined with the winning bid, constitute
contracts ready to be signed without significant changes after closing of the bidding procedure; thus
further reducing the processing time and costs related to the procurement process;
- the contracts concluded in the above way guarantee a smooth work during the implementation,
fulfilment period, and a co-operation between the contracting parties as well as a correct observance
of the terms and conditions of the contract,
- the employees of the electricity branch got acquainted with the management and administration
procedures of World Bank loans. This knowledge represents a safe financial foundation for the
projects under implementation and also provides a guarantee in the contacts maintained with other
financial instituttons.
It has been proven that the objectives set by MVM conceming the energy program were, except
for some minor revisions, correct, for the power sector has been able to meet the demands without the
construction of new power stations, through the increase in the generation capacity achieved by the
reconstruction and an appropriate maintenance of the coal fired power stations, taking naturally into
consideration also the energy imported and produced outside the sector.
The considerable reduction in the environment pollution caused by the power stations, resulting
from the systematic support and observance of efforts taken in the protection of environment,
represents a further result.
8.3    Technical assistance
About 20 Hungarian specialists, mainly from the electricity sector, took part in various training
and co-operation programs related to the modelling. Not only the models and methods suggested by
the World Bank were taken over successfully, but also their constructive improvement and the sharing
of experiences with the electricity specialists of other developing countries were also performned, for
instance:
- taking part in the improvement of the WASP-Ill program (WASP-IV);
- development of the software package ENPEP (a new LDC module, integration of Icarus);

APPENDIX
Page 13 of 23
- development of the LRMC calculation software package and the user documentation;
- several experts of the sector have acted as specialists the training programs of the Intemational
Nuclear Energy Agency.
The specialists of MVM leamed how to adapt other calculation and planning models, e.g.:
- application of ARIMA/SARIMA type models for the estimation of the medium term electricity
demands;
- application of artificial neural networks for estimating the medium and short term electricity
demands,
- application of the calculation software package prepared by Power Technologies Inc. (PTI)
Schenectady, New York, USA for the simulation and calculation of transmission networks of
electricity generation;
- adaptation and use of the long term financial model prepared by Coopers and Lybrand;
- Warme Schema Rechnung software for the calculation of the heatflow of power stations.
All the above software and procedures are in permanent use or are about to be introduced,
rendering assistance for the everyday decision making mechanisms.
Note:
A detailed Implementation Completion Report (herein referred to as MVM Rt's Implementation
Completion Report) was prepared on the implementation of the Power Project which was forwarded to
the World Bank by MVM Rt. in early March 1996. The Implementation Completion Report on the
Kelenfold sub-project was also completed after the successful implementation of the Kelenfold sub-
project and was handed over to the Mission Leader of the World Bank Supervision Mission in May
1996. For other details relating to the Project refer to MVM Rt's Implementation Completion Report.
