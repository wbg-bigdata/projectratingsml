B1I0TB (DIESEL) PORE PROJECT - (LOAN 2187-CE)
PREACE
j  1.    The project Involved the turnkey construcetLn of an 80 MN  diesel
power station at Sapug k     nan  near Colombo, the capiutl of S8l Lanka. It
covered all civil, mechanical and electrical works and technical services,
includiog engineerting, supervision and training of personnel. A project loan
of USS42.7 lillion vas approved on June 6, 1982, with full comercial opera-
tion of the plant (4 a 20 MN) schaduled for March 1984, and loan closure for
March 31, 1985. iowever, slower-than-expected procureent and civil dlitur-
bances delayed full comLisioning until September 1, 1984. Since, however,
any lt_ms were outstanding, the closing dato wa extended by one year and the
loan actually closed on August 8, 1986.
2.       The total project cost wa US$51.3 mlllion, 951 of the original
estimate of US$54.0 million; hoever, net of port duties and tazes, the
project ws completd at 811 of the estimted cost, or US$41.0 million com-
pared to US$50.5 million. Local costs, includin  Import duties and taxe  of
US$10.3 million (almost triple the estimted US$3.5 million), were US$15.0
capared wth the SA estimate of US$12 millon, and foreign costs were
US$36.3 illion compard with the estimated US$42.0 million. Favorable mrket
conditions In 1982 led to bids for below the orignal estimate, causing con-
sid*eable savings In the turkey contract. As a reslt, only US$34.2 mllion
wa disbursed from the loan US$6 million of the original nunt wa canclled
on December 1, 1985, and the remaining US$2.5 amllion was cacelled on Augut
o, 1986, following loan closure.
3.       This Project Completion  aport wa prepared by the South Asia legion
on the basis of the Staff Appraisal Report 3891b-Cl dated May 20, 1982, the
Loan and Project Agrements, dated Augut 8, 1982, a completion report sub-
mitted by the borrower, docuents In Bank files, and a mission to Srl Lanka in
October 1986.
4.       In accordance wlth the ?evised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, ths Project Completion Report wa read by the Operations
Evaluation Departent O(OED), but the project wll not be audited by OlD staff.
OD sent copies of the draft report to the Borrwer and Executing Agecy for
coute.  The comAnts received jve boon taken Into account In preparin  the
fiml report and tlhy are reproduced as an Attachment to rbe Report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
1.      Delays in several hydro stations under construction by the Mahaweli
Authority of Sri Lanka, and the need for the-'al back-up to the hydro system
in case of below-average rrinfall, prompted the Bank in 1981 to take 1uick
action to assist CEB in financing a diesel power station of up to 120 MW.
Subsequently, the station's size was reduced to 80 MW following lower load
forecasts which were prepared to take account of a slow-down in economic
activity (para. 2.01).
2.      In view of the need for early completion, bid documents were issued
in January 1982.  Commissioning of the power station was initially targeted
by CEB for late 1983, but delays in finalizing financing arrangements and
project preparation, including Bank review of bid documents, necessitated a
revision of the commissioning date to March 1984 (para. 3.03). Because of
this delay, interruptions in power supply, totalling about 37 GWh (1.7X of
total sales), occurred from November 1983 through February 1984.
3.      The objective of speedy physical completion of the project was sub-
stantially met (para. 3.03). The project was appraised in January 1982 and
approved by the Board in July 1982. A contract for a 4 x 20 MV plant was
awarded on October 12, 1982 with a target completion date of mid-July 1984.
In the event the fourth and final unit was coummissioned in September 1984
(para. 3.03). The principal reason for the delay was slower than expected
procurement and civil disturbances in mid-1983. Although all the units were
commissioned by September 1984, final acceptance was delayed because of
numerous outstanding items which the contractor had not completed (para.
3.04).
4.      The project achieved its technical objectives, although CBS has had
considerably lower requirements for thermal generation than were forecast.
This was due to favorable hydrological conditions and to lower demand for
electricity because of slower economic growth. Consequently, through
end-1986, energy generation by the new plant was minimal. Its main function
has been as a back-up plant to meet demand during maintenance and periods of
technical supply difficulties. For example, in 1986, the 3 x 67 KW Kotmale
hydro statrion developed penstock difficulties and was taken out of service
until 1988. Thus, compared to the SAR forecast, the benefit of the Sapugas-
kanda power station as a reserve and peaking plant has increased and its
energy function has decreased substantially (para. 4.01).



-vi-
5.     1U  primary project objective was to provide additional generating
capacity to meet forecast demand at least cost. The institutional objectives
were generally those agreed under previous lending operations, particularly
the Sixth (Cr. 1048-CE) and Seventh (Cr. 1210-CE) Power Projects. Institu-
tional objectives and actual performance are not discussed in detail ih the
present report, but will be addressed in the forthcoming completion report
for the Sixth and Seventh Power Projects.  Although CEB's financial perfor-
mance was generally satisfactory (paras. 5.03-5.07) during the period when
the project was constructed, 1982-85, its wider institutional performance
was mixed. The principal issue was inadequate staffing, as a result of low
remuneration and the exodus of expert staff to work in tLa Middle East
countries (para. 6.01). In early 1985 CEB had only 300 qualified engineers,
of whom fewer than 102 had more than five years' experience with CEB. Since
job opportunities elsewhere, particularly in the Gulf countries, are now
severely restricted the staffing of CEB appears to be improving. An
accelerated program for the implementation of institutional changes is under-
way, and agreement was reached under the Ninth Power Project (Cr. 1736-CE)
that CEB would prepare, and put into effect by December 31, 1987, a scheme of
incentives and a promotion policy based on merit to assist it in the reten-
tion and recruitment of suitable staff.

EIGHTH (DIESEL) POWER PROJECT - Loan 2187-CE
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01    Csa's electricity sales increased annually about 9.5Z during 1961-80,
includirsg about 11.51 in 1978-80. During the latter years, the Government
decided to accelerate the construction of large multipurpose projects, prin-
cipally in the Mahaweli basin, including hydro power components for transfer
to CEB upon completion. In this context, CUB required the accelerated expan-
sion of its transmission system, both at the existing 132-kV level and at a
higher voltage level (220-kV), to allow for more extensive transmission of
electricity and to connect the new hydro stations to the national grid for
supply to the main demand centers. Although CEB was restructured in the
early 1970s to cope with this rapid growth, the need for further restructur-
ing became apparent at the end of the decade in order to assure its efficient
operation in 180s. The Bank Group addressed the technical and institutional
problems that arose as a result of this rapid growtb under the Sixth and
Seventh Power Projects.
The _ower Subsector
1.02    Electricity supply in Sri Lanka began as a private sector operation
in 1905.  It ceased as a private business in 1927, when the Covernment bought
the utility and created a government department for electricity supply. CEB
was created as a statutory corporation in 1969 to take over that department's
cesponsibilities for the generation and transmission of electricity
throughout the country and distribution in the networks which had been
operated by its predecessor. Remaining distribution networks were operated
by local authorities, and during the project period, 1982-1985, CEB supplied
electricity in bulk to 214 local authorities which accounted for about
Ote-fourth of total supply. These local authorities (licensees) were mainly
Orgnized on a municipal basis servicing relatively small load centers which
"eTe dominated by domestic consumers. Due to their perennial financial
PrOblems ant high distribution losses (25-30X being common), the Covernment
in 1984 created the Lanka Electric Company (LECO) under the Companies Act to
take over licensees gradually. The Asian Development Bank is assisting LECO
n thbe organizational aspects of this endeavor and in renovating networks.
1.03    In 1982, CUB's total installed capacity was 55' KW, all intercon-
nected in one system. The hydro/thermal capacity mix was 66:34, 369 NW and
190 MI respectivelyt including 120 MW gas turbine capacity. The main trans-
QSision voltages were at 132-kV (915 km) and 66-kV (344 km). Distribution
was served by a system of 33-kV (5,230 km) and 11-kV (1,205 km) overhead
lines- The lengths of the licensees' distribution facilities are not on
record.



-2-
1.04    The CEB statutes allow it a reasonable measure of autonomy, which
has not been realized, particularly since it was brought under the super-
vioory responsibility of the Ministry of Power and Energy that was created in
the early 19800 to rationalize the energy sector.  For economic and political
reasons, the Government has reserved to itself a substantial role in policy
mac.ers and appoints both CUB's Chairman, who is also Secretary of State of
*                the Ministry of Power and Energy, and the Ceneral Manager.  The conditions of
service for all CUB staff are subject to Covernment regulations which allow
midnimal room for incentives. The loss of experienced staff to the private
sector and overseas has been exacerbated by a promotion system based on
seniority rather than merit. In early 1985, of the 300 engineers in CEB less
than 10 has more than five years' experience with CEB. LEC0, by contrast,
i                is substantially free from Government interference and allowed to set inde-
pendent service conditions. However, a agreement with CEB, which is the
principal shareholder, prohAibits employment of CEB personnel and, thus, the
formation of LECO has not contributed to the exodus of experienced personnel
from CUB.
1.05    During project execution, the power subsector encountered many
difficulties, reflecting economic and political problems in the country. It
is, therefore, satisfactory to note that CEB's financial viability was
generally maintained by adequate tariff rate adjustments (para. 5.03). Even
so, owing to structural deficiencies, some financial problems were
experienced, particularly with regard to accounts receivable (para. 5.09).
e                This issue was addreased under the Ninth Power Project (Cr...1736-CE).
1.06    Although the execution of works (including Bank Croup financed
projects) suffered from many delays, CEB's installed cspacity increased from
559 MW in 1982 to 949 MW in 1985, an increase of 701. In December 1985, the
plant mix was 679 MS hydro (increase of 85x) and 270 MW thermal (increase of
42Z). The 220-kV system was substantially completed by mid-1986--about two
years late.  The delays in most works, including the project, did not cause
any difficulties of substance, because growth in demand was slower than
originally projected (paras. 4.01 and 5.05).
lank Group Involvement
1.07    To date, rhe Bank Group has supported the power subsector through
nine projects, excluding the Ukuwela power station (1976, which is a part of
a multipurpose Mahaweli Development Project). Up to and including the
Seventh Power Project, loans amounted to US$58.4 million equivalent and
credits to US$61.5 million equivalent (Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Power
projecte), excluding Ukuwela. The loan for the Eighth Power Project was
US$42.7 million. Total original commitments (including the recently approved

Group lending to Sri Lanka (as of September 30, 1986).

II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PPREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
ePrjct Origin, Preparation. Appraisal, Negotiation and Approval
2.01   An electricity demand forecast for 1981-90 was prepared under the
Seventh Power project (CL81).  The projected growth rate was 24Z for 1981,
9.1Z for 1982, 21.6X for 1983 and 14.9Z for 1985. On this basis, and assum-
ing that the 120 KW of existing gas turbine capacity would operate at a 70S
plant factor from 1982 onwards, the energy deficit was projected to be about
s        200 GWh (71) in 1984 and 100 GWh (31) in 1985 under normal hydro conditions
after allowing for the commissioning of the Victoria 3 X 70 MU hydro plant.
In 1980 CEB, assisted by consultants, initiated studies for additional ther-
mal capacity and in 1981, prepared a long-term least cost generation planning
study in cooperation with the Bank Croup, using the Wien Automatic System
Planning Package (WASP). As a result of the study, the originally envisaged
need for a 120 MW thermal plant was reduced to 80 KW.  The project was
developed in the course of supervising the Sixth Power Project and develop-
ment of the Seventh Power Project. During preparation of the latter project,
the Bank Group decided to pursue the Eighth Power Project as soon as possible
and agreed in November 1981 to initiate its processing.
2.02    Project appraisal occurred in January 1982, focusing only on techni-
cal and economic aspects. Except for the chapters pertaining to the project
and justification, the appraisal reports of the Seventh and Eighth Power
Projects were almost identical.
2.03  - Partial financing through an IDA credit was considered but the
project did not form part of IDA's long-term lending program.  Upon request
of IDA, the Government investigated the possibilities of other financing. No
additional financing could be realized in view of the requirements for the
rapid completion requiring a single construction responsibility (turnkey
contract), consequently in April 1982 the Bank decided on a loan to cover the
full foreign exchange requirements.
2.04    The Loan was neigotiated in May 1982, approved by the Board oan
June 24, 1982, and became effective November 11, 1982. Because the project's
objectives were primarily technical and economic (para. 2.06), its institu-
tional objectives repeated those of the Seventh Power Project. Other objec-
tives I/ were defined under the Sixth and Seventh Power Projects, and will be
discussed in the forthcoming combined project completion report for those
projects; the present report discusses institutional objectives in general
terms only (Chapter VI), but provides details on financial performance
(Chapter V).

2.05    Tariff revisions were implemented in accordance with long-run
marginal cost (LRNC) principles, based on CEB tariff studies in 1981 and 1984
(para. 5.03). While CEB's tariff rates were unchanged between 1972 and 1977,
the average rate, excluding the fuel adjustment charge was increased by about
75Z in 1979, about 232 in 1980, 60X in 1981 and about 32Z in 1982. Based on
the 1984 LRMC study, a further rate increase of about 80X was introduced in
1985.
Project Objectives
2.06    The major objective of the project was to prevent electricity
shortages by providing additional capacity through a type of plant that would
remain economically justified throughout its normal life span. It was
forecast that without the project, even if all hydra stations under construc-
tion were completed on time, Sri Lanka could experience both capacity and
energy shortages through 1985, when maximum demand was expected to be 698 MW
and firm capacity (after reserves) only 653 MW (giving a shortfall of about
6Z). Energy demand for 1985 was forecast at 3,313 GWh, while total plant
generating capability during an average hydrological year would be 3,193 GWh
(shortfall of about 41). Although not specifically stated, the project was
to continue efforts toward CZB's institutional improvement that were agreed
to under the Sixth and Seventh Power Projects.
Project Description
2.07    The project comprised the turnkey construction of an 80-MW diesel
power station at Sapugaskanda in the northern suburbs of Colombo near the
refinery and a new pot&ble water plant' a 132-kV substation, and consulting
services for final design preparation of bid documents and supervision of
construction.
III. IMPLIEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness
3.01    Except for the standard legal provisions, there were no conditions of
effectiveness and, following compliance, the loan became effective, within
the 90-day provision after signing on govember 11, 1982.
Project Design and Enginecering
3.02    The power station was originally designed to be executed with
radiator cooling.  In the bidding documents, however, CEB sought bids for
alternative cooling towers which would use water from a new treatment plant
under construction by the Potable Water Authority, which welSomed the
prospect of CEB as a consumer with a demand of about 1,800 m per day, or
about 15X of the treatment plant's capacity. CEB selected the cooling tower
system, due to its lower capital (about one-fourth) and operational costs,
compared to a radiator cooling system. In hindsight, this choice is ques-
tionable, since the use of potable water for power station cooling would not
have high priority in times of technical problems or severe drought. Some



technical problems at the gotable water plant have caused rationing to CEB.
A storage tank for 3,000 m (less than two days of full power plant opera-
tion) is expected to be contracted soon to cover some fluctuation in supply.
Therefore, CEB should initiate a study to ascertain if and when a partial or
complete replacement of the potable water supply, using a closed system
cooling, would be required. However, reverting to river water would not be
an acceptable solution, since the heavy pollution would adversely affect the
thermal system and the engines would have to be derated.
Project Execution
3.03    The project was executed reasonably satisfactorily.  Bid documents
were opened in April 1982, and CEB planned to award the contract immediately
after loan signing. Bid evaluation, however, was extremely difficult 1/,
causing a four-month delay. The award was made in October, and the contract
signed on November 12, 1982. Initially agreed dates for completion were
April through June 1984. Under a bonus provision, the first two (20 NW each)
units were to be completed in February 1984 and the two remaining units (20
MW each) in July 1984. However, in July 1983, civil disturbances interrupted
work and personnel subsequently returned to the site more slowly than
expected. The revised target date for the first two units, late April 1984,
was met, as was August 15, for the third unit; however, the fourth unit
started operations two weeks late on September 1, 1984.
3.04    Although the units were ready for commercial operation, work not
directly connected to the running of the machines. remain to be completed.
Numerous important items were missing e.g., most tools and spares had not
arrived and much outstanding work was pending, such as fire pcotection
facilities, repair of unreliable control circuitry, and installation of
workshop facilities. Some teething problems were experienced, such as gas
leakages in the cylinder heads of one engine and turbo-blower problems for
all engines. The manufacturer was investigating the causes in late 1986 and
had returned one blower to the factory for tests in order to remedy the
defects. CE8's main difficulties with the contractor, however, are not
qualitative, but quantitative, with respect to contract completion. "As
built" drawings are still to be completed, and spares used by the contractor
prior to preliminary takeover have not been replaced (see Annex 1). As a
result, final acceptance certificates have not been issued. The contractor
disputed a penalty applied to the late completion of the fourth unit and
final payment of retention monies had not been made in October 1986.
1/ The question arose whether the lowest evaluated bidder was to be
considered "responsive" in the light of the requirement of proven opera-
tional experience with the machine offered. Three different committees
in Sri Lanka had different opinions and opinions in IDA were similarly
divided. Representations by the various manufacturers further aggravated
the situation until consensus was reached on non-acceptability of the
diesels because, although based on a well known design, they had never
operated commercially at the required speed, capacity and number of
cylinders, while diesels offered by competitors had proven operational
experience, despite a slightly older design (diesel manufacturers upgrade
designs and performance almost continuously).



-6-
3.05    In view of the outstanding issues between CEB and the contractor, the
Bank extended the original closing date of March 31, 1985 by one year.
During supervision, CEB was repeatedly requested to take measures to solve
the outstanding problems and disburse the required funds. CEB was not in a
position to issue the Taking Over Certificate although the plant was commis-
sioned, due to the Contractor not meeting the contractual requirements in
regard to supply of spares to issue the certificate for payment by July 1986
and the Bank finally informed CEB that it would only disburse against
requests reiching the Bank before August 1, 1986. The Bank informed CEB, on
March 10, 1986, of the closing procedure. The remaining funds were cancelled
from the loan account on August 9, 1986. Amounts due to the contractor
(excluding disputed amounts) at the end of August 1986 amounted to about US$3
million equivalent.
3.06    CEB reporting to the Bank during project execution did not civer all
aspects of the project. Although the consultants reported monthly to CEB,
the condensed information sent to the Bank as quarterly reports (also
prepared by the consultants) was inadequate since they only contained infor-
mation on the "contract" work. Only seven quarterly reports were received by
the Bank, the first dated June 30, 1983 and the seventh, June 1986. No
reports were submitted between September 1984 and June 1985. The reports
were not supplemented by a separate CEB report giving its views on project
execution and supervision, progress on project work e-ecated by CEB, and
providing full project accounting information. The same problems were
apparent for the Sixth and Seventh Power Projects. This issue was addressed
by a supervision mission in 1985. CEB now submits comprehensive quarterly
reports to the Bank, including project accounts which have been computerized.
CEB's unsatisfactory reporting performance was apparently due to lack of
experienced staff, who were already overburdened with day-to-day work.
Project Cost
3.07    The project was completed at a cost of about US$51.3 million, includ-
ing a front-end fee of about US$0.6 million, compared with an original
estimate of US$54 million. The estimate was prepared on the basis of actual
bids for the diesel engines which had been opened prior to preparation of the
final SAR. As the bids were invited on firm price basis, no provision was
included for price contingencies. Although the overall cost was 95% of the
estimate, the actual foreign cost (US$36.3 million) was only 862 of the
estimate (US$42 million). However, the actual local cost (at US$15 million
equivalent) was 125% of the original estimate (US$i2 million), largely
because import duties, estimated at US$3.5 million, were US$10.3 million.
The contractors' actual local costs were only about half the estimate, US$3.9
million versus US$7.4 million. CEB did not keep detailed records of its own
costs, particularly supervision and overhead costs. Consequently CEB's own
costs have been estimated in this report. This defect has been rectified
under the new system of accounts and improved project accounting system
(para. 3.06).
3.08    As is usual, variation orders were issued.  They amounted to about
5.6% of the original foreign portion of the contract price and 11.0% of the
local portion, and were thus roughly in line with the estimated physical
contingencies of 5% and 10% respectively. However, in 1985 it was apparent



that considerable sums would remain undisbursed and US$6 million was can-
celled on December 1, 1985. At the closing date, only US$34.2 million (801)
of the original loan amount of US$42.7 million had been disbursed; thus, a
further US$2.5 million was cancelled on August 9, 1986, following the closing
of the loan.
3.09    Before the first cancellation, CEB had sought Bank agreement to use
the savings to purchase equipment for a new training school. This request
was outside the description and scope of the project; subsequently IDA agreed
to consider financing the equipment under the Sixth and Seventh Power
projects, which included specific training provisions.
Disbursements
3.10    The estimated and actual disbursements are shown in Annex 3.  The
actual disbursements were both lower than had been estimated and occurred at
a slower rate because: (i) the contract was signed later than expected;
(ii) the foreign cost was below the estimate; (iii) civil disturbances
delayed completion; and (iv) outstanding technical problems were not resolved
expeditiously by the contractor, and retention monies could not be released
because the final completion certificate had not been issued.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01 - When the project became operational in 1984 the demand conditions
were very different to those projected in the SAR, The growth rates of peak
demand and energy consumption in the period 1981-1984 were much lower than
had been projected. The comparison of forecast and actual demand for elec-
tricity is shown in Annex 4. Except in 1983, just prior to the Project's
completion in 1984, hydro conditions were good. In 1984 peak demand, at 487
MW, was 201 (123 MW) below the SAR estimate. Similarly, energy demand, at
2,261 GWh, was 22X lower than the projected level.  This trend and favorable
hydro conditions continued in 1985 and 1986 and, as a consequence, in the
period 1984-86, the new plant's role, as a prospective provider of energy and
capacity, was changed to that of standby plant.. Without the project, the
capacity deficit would f-ave been about 20 MW in 1984 and 1986, and the 1985
surplus would have been 50 KW. In practice, the plant was only required for
energy purposes during March through May 1985, when production was only about
47 CWh.
4.02    These events and changes in demand do not constitute an argument that
the plant should have been postponed. CE8's management acted expeditiously
when the worsening capacity and energy capabilities showed the possibility of
large power shortages which had persisted from 1979 through 1983. Sub-
sequently, the physical condition of the Kelanitissa steam plant steadily
worsened and it was taken out of service in 1985 for rehabilitation and hydro
plapt construction delays have occurred due to penstock problems at Kotmale.
The present benefit of the plant, as standby capacity, is only temporary; it
is expected to generate significant quantities of energy in the period
1989-1996. An additional benefit of the plant is that of cost savings
resulting from the postponement of new thermal plant by at least a year (the
aunual growth of peak demand is in the order of the plant's capacity).

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Accounting Systems, Organization and Audit
5.01    CEB made substantial progress in improving its financial management
practices during project implementation. Modern accounting systems and
procedures for better financial reporting and control were implemented, based
on the recommendations of the consultants recruited under the Sixth Power
Project (Cr. 1048-CE). Accounting activities, with the exception of revenue
accounting, were decentralized, billing was automated and steps taken to
automate other areas of accounting and financial reporting, and an internal
audit unit was established. These changes have resulted in streamlined
financial reporting procedures and have improved CEB's control over its
finances by providing management with detailed and timely information.
Furthermore, in order to rationalize the values of assets and to establish
proper depreciation schedules the Board engaged consultants under the Sixth
Power Project (Cr. 1048-CE) to carry out a Fixed Asset Accounting Study. The
final report was issued in February 1987.
5.02    As with other public corporations, the external audit of CEB's
accounts is carried out by the Auditor General of Sri Lanka, which is accept-
able to the Bank Group.  Although the quality of audits has been satisfac-
tory, until FY85 .they were often submitted late to the Bank. This was a
result of the lengthy tima required for CEB to finalize the accounts because
of its complex internal reporting procedures. However, following CEB's
reorganization and improvements in reporting procedures (para. 5.01) in 1984,
the 1985 audited accounts were submitted within the covenanted period.
Tariffs
5.03    CEB's tariffs have been increased regularly to ensure compliance with
the financial performance covenant agreed with the Bank Croup (para. 5.06).
As agreed under the Sixth Power Project (Cr. 1048-CE), tariff studies based
on long-run marginal cost were undertaken in 1981 and 1984 and formed the
basis for significant changes in CEB's tariff structures. The tariff revi-
sion in March 1985 changed the tariff structure to allow for separate energy
and demand charges for hotel, industrial and general purpose consumers with
contract demands exceeding 40 kVA, and optional time of day energy rates for
industrial and hotel consumers. As shown in Table 1, the average revenue
per kWh (excluding fuel surcharge) increased from Rs 0.78 in 1982 to Rs 1.36
in 1985, i.e., at an average annual rate of about 26%. In contrast, the SAR
,forecast increases in average revenue from Rs 0.71/kWh to Rs 0.98/kWh, or
about 12.5% a year.

5.05    CEB's financial performance during the project implementation period
was satisfactory, despite adverse conditions that prevented it from achieving
the level of electricity generation and saLes projected in the SAR. Gener-
ation increased from 2,066 GWh in 1982 to 2,464 GWh in 1985, i.e., an average
annual increase of 6.4X compared to the SAR forecast of 13.6X. The principal
reason was the much slower growth of electricity sales than had been
projected in the SAR (para. 4.01). Actual sales increased from 1,679 GWh
in 1982 to 2,061 GWh in 1985, representing an average annual growth rate of
7.6Z, compared to the SAB projection of 13.62 Although electricity losse-
remained higher than the estimated level of 152 (due to a overloaded system
and metering and billing problems), they improved from a high of 192 in 1982
,to 16% in 1985. 'Although the lower sales resulted in a lower level of total
revenue, average revenue exceeded the SAR forecasts (except for 1983) due to
the periodic tariff increases (para. 5.03) and activation of the fuel sur-
charge. This enabled CEB to achieve a more favorable operating ratio than
the SAR projections and show a distinct improvement in all years except 1983.
In 1983, this ratio was 79.3 (compared to the SAR estimate of 73.1), mainly
because of a 1302 increase in administration costs, stemming from (i) wage
and salary increases, and (ii) interest payments on overdrafts necessitated
by cash flow problems resulting from the acute accounts receivable situation
(para. 5.09). The operating ratio improved during the fOllowing two years,
reaching 44.12 in 1985, compared to the SAR estimate of 67,9%, mainly because
-     fil I h1;t I nd     ntenance costs.



5.06    CEB's agreed measure of financial performance is an after tax minimum
rate of return of 8% on revalued average net fixed assets in operation. This
rate of return was 11.4Z in 1981 and 8.7% in 1982. In 1983, however, the
rate of return was 5.6Z due to the heavy income tax liability which was
underestimated by CEB in setting the tariff rates for that year. The tab ;s
levied on operating income, after deducting a depreciation allowance of 12.52
for newly commissioned assets, and based on the straight line method for all
other assets. A smaller depreciation expense for income tax purposes, caused
by delays (from the planned 1983 to 1984) in the transfer of Mahaweli assets
to CEB, resulted in a larger taxable income and, therefore, in a greater tax
liability than had been estimated for 1983. Excluding this tax liability,
the rate of return would have been 11.2% in 1983. Moreover, as a result of
the delays the asset base in 1984 was higher than projected, and conse-
quently, the rate of return was 7.4%. Audited accounts for 1985 show that
primarily due to the 75% increase in the average tariff rate in March 1985,
CEB achieved a rate of return of 10.72.
5.07    The significant tariff increase of 42% in mid-1982 resulted in rela-
tively high levels of resource availability for investment in 1982.  However,
in that year, CEBS's investments were re.atively low, since major generation
projects were being undertaken directly by Government under the Accelerated
Mahaweli Project (AMP) for transfer to CEB upon completion. These factors
resulted in a high self-financing ratio of 722 for 1982, measured as the
ratio of net internally generated cash available for investments to average
of investments made in the preceding, current and succeeding years. In
contrast, the underestimation of CEB's income tax Liability in 1983 and
consequent inadequate resource mobilization through tariff increases,
resulted in a lower self-financing ratio of 242 for the year. In 1984 and
1985, CEB achieved self-financing ratios of 21% and 14%, respectively. These
comparatively low levels of self-financing should be viewed in the light of
Government's practice in treating the transfer of Mahaweli assets to CEB.
The current practice is to transfer, at cost, the power component of the
scheme as equity or part equity/part loan, and concurrently treat that cost
as a part of CEB's investment for the year of transfer. This overstates the
utility's investment for the year and understates its level of
self-financing. If CEB's investments, net of Mahaweli transfers for 1984 and
1985 are considered, the self-financing ratio would have been 49% and 43X,
respectively.
Present Financial Position
5.08    CEB's balance sheets reflect fixed assets revalued annually as per
agreement with the Association under the Fifth Power Project (Cr. 372-CE).
CEB's balance sheet as of December 31, 1985, is presented in Annex 6 and

Debt/Equity Ratio                                      18/82
Government's equity contribution, primarily in the form of transfer of
Nahaweli assets (para. 5.07) to CEBS, increased from 11Z of total equity as of
December 31, 1982 to 32Z as of December 31, 1985 and was a major reason for
CEB's strong capitalization position with a debt/equity ratio of 18/82. In
addition, the coverage of debt service by gross funds generated internally
was satisfactory at 3.1.
Accounts Receivable
5.09    Under this and preceding Bank Croup power projects, CEBS is required
to'ensure that its accounts receivable do not exceei. three months' billings.
Although it has made considerable efforts to satisfy this covenant, CEB's -
accounts receivable have persistently exceeded the agreed level. The result-
ing cash flow problem necessitated extensive use of overdraft facilities,
which in turn resulted in increased operating costs, particularly in 1983
(para. 5.05). The three categories of consumers which were responsible for
most of the accounts receivable as of December 31, 1985 were: local
authorities (402 of total accounts receivable and 11.6 months' billings);



-13-
private consumers (37Z of total accounts receivable and 4.1 months' bill-
ings); and Government departments (9Z of total accounts receivable and 7.9
months' billing). Therefore, in order to ease cash flow problems, CUB
initiated in 1985 a number of measures to reduce accounts receivable. Addi-
tionally, in September 1985, the Government aessumed responsibility for the
payment of arrears and future accounts for street lighting, the accounts
receivable for which had exceeded 48 months in mid-1985, but which have now
been settled. By end-August 1986, receivables from local authorities were
reduced to 4.65 months billing, primarily because of a revenue grant of Re
450 million from the Covernment to CES, which was used to write off an equiv-
alent amount from local authority receivables. With these measures, CBS has
beQn able to reduce its total receivables from 4.5 months' billings in Hay
1985 to 3.3 months in August 1986.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DBVEWPMENT
6.01    As indicated above (para. 2.04)2 the details on CUB's institutional
development will be discussed in the forthcoming joint completion report for
the Sixth (Cr. 1048-CE) and Seventh (Cr. 1210-C8) Power Projecte. The siZua-
tion during the project period (1982 to early 1986) can be summarized as
follows:
(a) in 1982 CEB's autonomy was not appropriate for the requirements of a
rapidly growing power utility, and it did not improve materially
during project execution;
* -      (b) the exodus of experienced personnel due to low remuneration peaked in
1984 and thereafter leveled off, due to the decrease in employment
opportunities overseas, particularly in the Gulf countries.  The
situation was exacerbated by CES's promotion policy emphasizing
seniority rather than merit. A scheme is being developed under the
Ninth Power Project to address this issue;
(c) CgB, during the project period, suffered continuously from a number
of manpower problems. It was simultaneously overstaffed in some
departments and deficient in key personnel in many important func-
tional areas. The lack of experienced middle-level staff to improve
productivitj and maintain efficient professional discipline was the
main cause. The situation can be expected to improve through a
comprehensive strategy which is being developed under the Ninth Power
Project;
(d) under the Sixth (Cr. 1048-CE), Seventh (Cr. 1210-C8) and Eighth Power
Projects, CEB's organization was regionalized and redefined.  New
systems of operation procedures (including accounting and administra-
tion) were introduced. During execution of the project, however,
systems design and implementation proceeded at a slower pace than was
expected and were operating only partially at the end of 1986; and



-14-
(a) nevertheless, the changes in td) above have already markedly improved
financial reporting, control of finances and the timely provision of
information to management. Effective streamlining of the lower
levels of CEB's organization, however, cannot be expected to be
completed before the early 1990s and will depend largely on the
recruitment, training and retention of middle management and higher
level staff.
VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
7.01    Project justification was based on the least cost approach.  However,
the lack of a well-defined investment program forced the final comparison to
be made in terms of three thermal planting alternatives operating in isola-
tion from the supply system: operation of (i) 120 MN existing gas turbines
plus 80 NW new diesel capacity; (ii) 40 NW existing gas turbines, plus a new
combined cycle of the remaining 80 MS of gas turbines and 40 NW of
ezhaust-fired steam units; or (iii) 120 NW of existing gas turbines only. At
all discount rates, alternative (i) was the least-cost option. The
re-evaluation of the project using 1986 prices confirms that it was the
least-cost option.
7.02    The SAR calculated the economic internal rate of return (EICR) on the
project in isolation from the supply system. Benefits were estimated in
terms of consumers' willingness to pay for electricity, and costs in terms of
border prices.  The SAR did not discuss the rationale for the chosen
methodology. Since the operation of the 80 mw thermal plant is highly sensi-
tive to hydrological conditions and hydro plant completion, the EIRR should
have been e.stinated using a total system, time slice, analysis, in terms of
both the plant's projected energy and power outputs and its contribution to
improving reliability of supply. The station was forecast to generate about
1,600 GWh in its first three years of operation, but in the event, generated
less than 10 of this aount.
7.03    The ERl  has been recalculated in accordance with the SAR method, but
using 1986 constant prices (Annex 8). Projected thermal generation for
1986-2002 was assessed, using the WASP III system planning model. Benefits
were measured in terms of consumers' willingness to pay for electricity; Rs
2.44/kWh using 1986 prices compared with Rs 2.09/kWh in the SAR. On this
basis, the ex-ante internal economic rate of return is about 18Z, compared
with 14S in the SAM. The principal reason for the increase is the con-
siderably lower economic cost of fuel.
7:04    The SAR estimated the cost of transmission and distribution
facilities attributable to the project at 30% of its capital cost. This was
an underestimate. 1/ In addition, the plant is operating, and is expected to
operate, below the projected plant factor. Assuming a "worst case" scenario
1/ Power Subsector Review, Report No. 5713-CE, dated July 25, 1986, Table
7.2, page 70 shows that investments in transmission and distribution
1 'st   - 11I' ;nvotst *&ts 4n *"nerat;on.



-1S-
of a plant factor of 0.40 and an increase in capital cost for transmission
and distribution to 45X of the project's own capital cost, the ex-ante eIRR
would decline to about 121, compared to the opportunity cost of capital of
10x.
VIII. PERFORKANCE OF THE BORROWER AND THE BANK
8.01    CEB's performance regarding project execution was generally satisfac-
tory. In recognition of its lack of experienced personnel, day-to-day super-
vision of construction was entrusted to consultants, assisted by some CBS
engineers who thereby gained considerable experience. However, the following
observations appear relevant:
(a) in anticipation of restricted access to unpolluted and sufficient
sources of natural cooling water, C8B should assess the feasibility
of installing radiator cooling;
(b) the timely amendment of the performance bond clause of the contract
would have avoided the accrual of the large amount of retention
monies, and would have allowed the remaining funds in the loan
account to be largely disbursed. However, the amendment of the
Performance Bond would have required seeking approval of the Cabinet
as the contract was awarded on the recommendations of the Cabinet
Tender Board.
(c) the-diesels are being run sparingly which: (i) reduces the
possibility of overcoming teething problems before the plant is
required to run at a high-load factor; (ii) limits training oppor-
tunities and, thus, increases the risk factor in future operation at
high load; and
(d) reporting on project execution and accounting was inadequate, except
for the main contract during project implementation and improved in
1986.
8.02    The Bank Group maintained good relations with the borrower, consider-
ing the difficult institutional problems during project execution resulting
from economic problems and civil disturbances in the country. Such difficul-
ties had little effect on project completion.
8.03    The possibility of future problems stem_ing from the use of potable
water for cooling should have been anticipated and alternatives explored.

IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01    The project was satisfactorily executed except for the contractor's
non-performance regarding outstanding items. The plant has, since commis-
sioning, been required to operate at low capacity which constitutes a
considerable financial and economic benefit since less oil was imported and
used, but this operating situation has precluded CEB staff from gaining
necessary experience.
9.02    The project did not, and was not expected to, contribute materially
to institutional improvements. Institutional issues were addressed under the
Sixtb and Seventh Power Projects. The primary objective of the project was
to assure additional thermal capacity to meet forecast demand for electricity
at least cost.
9.03    The period of project execution (1982-85) was a difficult one for
CEB. Although the situation is improving, fundamental problems remain to
be resolved; especially the recruitment and retention of experienced staff.

Sri Lankes Eighth (Diesel) Power Project
(Loan 2187-CE)
1 wish to refer to your letLer dated January 26. 1988
and wish to indicate the following observations with
regard to the draft Project Completion Report on the

1.  Page v - 3rd Para - 4th Line
The target completion date was Mid July 1964 and not
Mid June 1984.
2.  Page v - 3rd Para - 8th Line
'until November 1986' has to be 4oleted since final
acceptance has not beon issued up-to-date.
3.  Page 0 - Para 3.04
We request correction of the Cirst *entence as

4. Page-6 - Para 3.05
We wish you to delete the word *No action was taken*
and amplify the sentence as follows.
CBD was not in a position to issue the Taking Over
Certificate although the plant was commissioned, due
to the Contractor not meeting the contractual
requirements in regard to supply of apares to iisue
the certificate for payment by July 1986' and bank
finally informed CEB .......
5. Paie 16 - Para 8.01
I wish to make the following with regard to
amendment of the Performance Bond.
"The amendment of the Periormance Bond would have
required seeking approval of the Cabinet as the
*                contract was awardad on the reccammndations of the
Cabinet Tender Board".                                             (
