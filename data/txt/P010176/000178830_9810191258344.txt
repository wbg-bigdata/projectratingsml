SRI LANKA
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
EIGHTH (DIESEL) POWER PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTOR
A. Energy Resources
1.01    Sri Lanka in 1981 had a population of 14.9 million and a gross
national product of $250 per capita. Energy consumed in 1980 amounted to
about 3.7 million toel/, of which 60% was provided by fuelwood, 13% by
hydropower and 27% by imported oil. The country has no known reserves of
coal, oil or natural gas, and its small deposits of peat are not significant.
An Energy Assessment mission from the Bank visited Sri Lanka in June 1981 and
its report will be published shortly.
Hydro Power
1.03    Sri Lanka has an area of 25,332 square miles.  Most of its
precipitation comes from the Southwest monsoon from about May to September
and from the Northeast monsoon from about December to March. Annual average
rainfall varies from less than 40 inches in some northern parts of the island
to more than 200 inches in places on the southwest slopes of the hills.
Hydro power potential totals about 6,600 GWh (1.7 million toe2/) per annum,
or 2,500 MW at 30% load factor, mainly in three basins centered on the
central highlands. They are the Mahaweli Basin in central Sri Lanka, the
Walawe Basin to the south, and the Kehelgamu-Maskeliya Basin to the
southwest. Some hydro power has already been developed in each of these
basins.
1.04    Installed hydro generating capacity totals 369 MW out of a total
installed capacity of 559 MW. Six more hydro stations are planned to bring
the total hydro installed to about 1,100 MW by 1990. The present yield of
firm energy is about 1,500 GWh per year; projected additions will increase
this to about 3,240 GWh by 1990 (Annexes 1 and 2).
Traditional Fuels
1.05     Wood is the most widely used fuel.  From such statistics as are
available it appears that annual consumption of wood from the forests is
between 3.8 and 5.4 million tons per year (1.5 - 2.2 million toe). To this
must be added 0.3 million tons per year (0.1 million toe) of fuelwood from
rubber and coconut plantations.
1/ toe = tonne oil equivalent = 10.2 x 106 kcal
2/ Primary equivalent based on 0.25 kgoe/kWh = 10,500 BTU/kWh
= 2,646 kcal/kWh



-2-
Petroleum
1.06    Exploration is taking place.  Sri Lanka was recently classified as
having favourable geological prospects for potential oil or gas discoveries,
but the chances of substantial finds are thought to be slight.
1.07    Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), a statutory corporation, is the
sole importer and refiner; its refinery near Colombo has a capacity of 2.35 M
tonnes per year. The refinery does not produce enough kerosene or diesel
fuel to satisfy local demand and the deficits are imported. Kerosene is sold
on the local market at a price lower than either the cost of importing it or
of producing it locally. Furnace oil, a blend of residual and distillate
used among other purposes to fuel CEB's steam power station, is produced by
CPC in greater quantity than the local market can absorb and the surplus is
exported. Gasoline is sold at a high price to help offset the cost of
subsidizing kerosene.l/
1.08    Data from CPC given in Table 1.1 indicate that refined imports have
been rising rapidly in recent years to meet increasing demand for kerosene
and diesel fuel.

B. The Power Subsector
Sector Organization
1.09    Sri Lanka's first public electricity supply was made available in
Colombo in 1895 by Messrs Boustead Bros. The business was soon taken over
by United Planters Co., who extended it and in 1899 built the Colombo
electric tramways. In 1902, the Colombo Electric Tramways and Lighting Co.
Ltd. was formed and provided electricity supply until 1927 when the
Department of Government Electrical Undertakings (DGEU) was established to
control the utility, which had by then been purchased by the Government.
DGEU was succeeded in 1969 when the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), a
statutory corporation, was established with responsibility for the
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. CEB supplies power
direct to consumers and also sells in bulk to local authorities who retail to
their own consumers. The Ministry of Power and Energy is responsible for
supervision of CEB's policies.
1.10    CEB has in the past been responsible for the development of
generating capacity and is now building the Canyon (60 MW) hydro station.
For the next several years hydro generating capacity will be developed by the
Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL), an agency established under the
Ministry of Mahaweli Development, having responsibility for the
implementation of the Accelerated Mahaweli Program. As they are completed,
the Mahaweli generating facilities will be transferred to CEB for operation.
During the next ten years some 580 MW of additional hydro capacity will be
developed in this way at Victoria, Kotmale, Randenigala and Rantembe (Annex
1).
External Assistance
1.11    Sri Lanka has in the past obtained external financal assistance
towards the foreign exchange costs of its development program. The Bank
Group has made available for power developments the following loans and
credits, totalling US$148.9 million:
(a) Loan 101-CE (US$15.9 million) to GSL in 1954 to help finance
the 25 MW expansion of the Laksapana hydroelectric scheme.
(b) Loan 209-CE (US$7.4 million) to GSL in 1958 to help finance
construction of a 25 MW thermal plant at Kelanitissa, Colombo.
(c) Loan 283-CE (US$14.1 million) to GSL in 1961 to help finance a
25 MW expansion at Kelanitissa.



-4-
(d)  Loan 636-CE (US$21.0 million) to CEBl/ in 1969 to help finance
the 90 MW Maskeliya Oya Stage II project, a 25 MW gas turbine,
and management consultancy and engineering services. US$4.5
million of this loan was cancelled when the gas turbine was not
purchased.
(e) Credit 372-CE (US$ 6.0 million) to GSL in 1973 for reinforcement
and extension of CEB's transmission and distribution systems.
(f) Credit 1048-CE (US$ 19.5 million) to GSL in 1980 for the Sixth
Power Project to provide further reinforcement and improvement
of CEB's transmission and distribution systems.
(g) Credit 1210-CE (US$36.0 million) to GSL in 1981 for the Seventh
Power Project, to finance 220 kV transmission lines from the
Mahaweli hydro stations to Colombo and to provide further
reinforcement of CEB-s existing transmission systems.
(h) Further, the Bank Group made available Loan 653-CE/Credit 174-CE
(US$29.0 million) to GSL in 1969 for the multi-purpose
(irrigation and power) Mahaweli Ganga Development of which the
38 MW Ukuwela power station formed a part.
1.12    Six projects have been completed satisfactorily, that under Credit
1048-CE is in progress, whilst the Seventh Power Project (Credit 1210-CE)
is just starting. Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR) have been
prepared for three of the above projects. That for Loan 653-CE/Credit
174-CE, which was for both irrigation and electricity, concluded that
although implementation was seriously delayed, the agricultural and power
benefits turned out to be much greater than expected at appraisal; the
benefit of power generated was much increased by the rise in petroleum prices
in 1973 and afterwards. The PPAR report on Loan 636-CE, for the 90 MW New
Laksapana hydro station, concluded that the project had been well conceived
and constructed; it was built at low cost, and its timing was fortunate in
that it was almost complete at the time of the 1973 oil crisis. A
significant institutional advance under Loan 636-CE was the establishment of
CEB as a public corporation, replacing the Department of Government
Electrical Undertakings. Despite a promising start, CEB did not develop as
well as expected and both the Sixth (Credit 1048) and the Seventh (Credit
1210-CE) projects seek to promote significant advances in CEB's management.
The PPAR report dealing with Credit 372-CE concluded that the project met its
major objectives; the extensions to the transmission and distribution system
built under it, though completed late, enabled full use to be made of the
Ukuwela and New Laksapana hydro stations.
1/ CEB was established in June 1969.

1.13    The Sixth Power Project is about a year behind schedule.
Effectiveness of Credit 1048-CE was postponed about 6 months because of a
delay in arranging cofinancing, and further delays arose owing to the
complexities of making procurement decisions, and because of changes of
senior staff in CEB. CEB has agreed to take action to ensure quicker
procurement and to avoid such delays in future. The Seventh (Mahaweli
Transmission) Power Project was approved by the Board on February 23, 1982,
and is expected to become effective shortly.
1.14    CEB's management shortcomings were noted in appraisal of previous
power project and in the PPAR report on the Fifth Power Project. A review of
CEB's managerial performance and methods, financed under Credit 1048-CE, has
been carried out by consultants, and action is being taken to restore
management systems, provide support to senior management, and implement
comprehensive training programs for all types of staff (paras 2.09-2.11).
1.15    The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided finance for
construction of the Bowatenne and Canyon hydro stations and for rural
electrification. GSL has arranged bilateral financing of hydro generation
components of the Mahaweli program as follows: - Sweden (Kotmale), U.K.
(Victoria) and the Federal Republic of Germany (Randenigala). Construction
of the Samanalawewa hydro development has been postponed until the early
1990's.
Existing Facilities
1.16    CEB's existing generating, transmission and distribution facilities
are described in Annexes 2 and 3. CEB's present installed capacity is 559
MW, all interconnected on one system. In addition there are privately owned
generating stations, most of them less than 500 kW but ranging as large as
5.75 MW in CPC's refinery at Sapugaskande and 6 MW at the urea factory. The
transmission and distribution system comprises 569 miles of 132 kV line with
17 substations, 214 miles of 66 kV lines with 9 substations, about 3,250
miles of 33 kV, and about 750 miles of 11 kV lines. The system control and
load dispatching centre is at Kolonnawa, and all important plants and
switching centers can communicate by means of power line carrier.
Development Program
1.17    Of recent years detailed planning has not usually extended more than
four or five years ahead, but in mid 1981 CEB prepared a detailed development
plan to meet its generation requirements over the next 15 years. The plan
has not yet been officially adopted by GSL. The proposed hydro program shows
additions to the end of this decade bringing the installed capacity to about
950 MW with a firm energy capacity of 3,170 GWh. In the first four years of
the next decade, additions to hydro capacity of 1,000 MW and 2,000 GWh are



-6-
proposed. To complement the hydro, some hundreds of megawatts of thermal
plant will be needed between 1985 and 1994.
1.18    During the negotiation of the Seventh Project it was agreed that
steps would be taken to put CEB-s planning on a workable footing. The new
General Manager should make planning a matter of high priority for his
personal attention. A corporate planning department should be formed to plan
generation and transmission and their associated capital expenditures.   The
same group should play a leading role in the preparation of one year and five
year operational budgets and capital budgets. The group would be required to
produce, by the end of 1982, a comprehensive development plan for generation,
transmission and distribution. The plan would extend 15 years ahead and
would be reviewed and updated annually. The assurance giveni by CEB under
Credit 1210-CE to submit such a plan, endorsed by GSL. to IDA by December 31
each year from 1982, was repeated under the proposed project.
1.19    CEB requires an effective planning unit to pursue a number of
pressing problems, including:
(a)  the immediate addition of the proposed 80 MW diesel power
station, which is necessary if energy shortages in 1984
and 1985 are to be minimized (Annex 1).
(b)  the timely commissioning of Victoria:  in particular the
impounding of the 1984 monsoon rains is of primary importance
and CEB must make every effort to avoid delay.
(c)  the energy shortages likely in 1982, 83 and 84:  programs to
minimize their impact, by means of economies and demand
management, have to be worked out in advance.
(d)  the need for one or two coal fired generating stations
toward the end of the present decade: sites need to be
selected and secured very soon.
1.20    In order to optimize the management and operation of the Mahaweli
resource, as well as the planning of future construction, it is expected that
CEB and MASL will cooperate closely, perhaps forming a joint planning unit.
An immediate planning requirement is an exhaustive hydro identification and
ranking study. CEB has requested GSL to have this performed and financed by
the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), who have done similar
service to other countries. The planning unit will establish and maintain
its mathematical models and computer programs in Colombo, so that forecasts
and plans can be updated as needed, and suggested changes from any quarter
can be readily and fully evaluated. Services required to assist CEB in
establishing its planning department will be funded from Credit 1048-CE.



-7-
Access to Service and Status of Supply
1.21    The total energy generated by CEB's power stations in 1980 was 1,668
GWh, about 89% of it hydro. CEB supplied about 208,000 consumers, including
218 local authorities who distributed electricity to another 226,000
consumers, making the total number of consumers about 434,000. Of these,
about 333,000 were domestic. This suggests that at present only about one
household in eight has an electricity connection. Rural electrification has
been extended to over 2,000 of a total 25,000 villages (para 1.27), but
electricity consumption per head was less than 100 kWh in 1980. The majority
of households use firewood for cooking and kerosene for lighting.
1.22    The Bowatenne hydro station was commissioned in 1981 and Canyon is
scheduled to be commissioned in 1982. Victoria and Kotmale are to come on
line in 1984 and 1985. To prevent shortages of capacity and energy before
the new hydro becomes available it was necessary to install additional
thermal plant. Three 20 MW gas turbines were installed in late 1980 and
early 1981. A second group of three 20 MW gas turbines was installed in
1981/82.
1.23    Further generation will be needed in addition to the six gas turbines
to supply the forecast energy needed in 1984, 85 and 86, and it is intended
that this will be provided by the project.
1.24    In the months of May through August 1980 there was load shedding to
the extent of about 50 GWh (about 3.5% of annual sales), made necessary by
lower than average rainfall, poor availability of steam units, and the
breakdown of one hydro unit at New Laksapana. Only one of the gas turbines
was in service before the end of 1980 because of ordering and construction
delays. CEB entered 1981 with its hydro reservoirs only 2/3 full, and load
shedding was again inevitable. It was started in February and continued into
June, with the loss of an estimated 69 GWh of sales. Toward the end of the
period, supplies to the general public were off for 8 hours per day, and 16
major public corporations were shut down to husband the little water
remaining in the reservoirs.
Plant Maintenance
1.25    The maintenance of CEB's transmission and distribution system has
been adequate although unsystematic. Less satisfactory are the distribution
lines of some of the local authorities, where for many years only the barest
maintenance has been done and more consumers have continually been added to
existing lines so that voltages at peak times are well below acceptable
levels. The largest of the local authority undertakings, Mt. Lavinia, near
Colombo, with about 14,000 consumers and serving a population of about
250,000, was taken over by CEB in 1979.



-8-
1.26    Maintenance of CEB's generating stations was done reasonably well
in the past, but has deteriorated in recent years. Adequate systems exist
for keeping plant history and maintenance records but in many stations they
are not kept up to date. There is no planned maintenance schedule for each
station to permit management to check easily that all items of plant are
provided for and have duly been serviced. These deficiencies were
particularly evident at the Kelanitissa steam plant, but efforts are now
being made to restore this station to a reasonable level of reliability. A
satisfactory overhaul program for the plant has been prepared and is set out
in Annex 4.
Rural Electrification
1.27    The first rural electrification schemes were undertaken in the early
1960s. Sri Lanka has about 25,000 villages and CEB had provided service to
about 2,000 of them by the end of 1979. Some of the local authorities who
buy in bulk from CEB have extended their lines into nearby villages, adding
to the extent of rural electrification. By the end of 1984, an additional
1,150 villages will be connected under a Rural Electrification project
financed by ADB and GSL at a total cost of US$ 31.8 million.
1.28    The ADB project is expected to introduce some significant
improvements in the handling of rural electrification:
(a)  the rural electrification force in CEB will be expanded and
empowered to scrutinize and monitor the formulation and
implementation of all new schemes and to implement the
ADB Project. CEB has agreed to appoint a Project Manager
for rural electrification and to establish a Load Promotion
and Monitoring Unit;
(b)  economic analysis and discounted cash flow calculations will
be employed in the feasibility analysis of rural schemes;
(c)  CEB will arrange installment financing of house wiring and
connection charges.
System Losses
1.29    Before 1976, energy losses on CEB's system were less than 12%, but
they have since been rising and are currently reported in excess of 16%.
Moreover, these figures do not include losses in the retail operations of
the local authorities, who buy in bulk about 25% of the energy sold by CEB
and distribute it at low efficiency. Analysis suggests that an acceptable
level for overall losses would be about 13% of gross generation. In future,
substantial blocks of energy will have to be generated thermally every year
making better control of losses even more important. CEB will
establish a cell within the planning group to monitor and control losses with
funds provided under the Seventh project.

Historical Consumption
1.30    Growth in consumption of electrical energy over the period 1961 to
1980 has averaged 9.5% p.a., ranging from 17.8% in 1966 to 3.3% in 1974.
From 1972 to 1977 there was a period of weaker growth, but it appears that a
rate higher than the long term trend is now being established.
1.31    The short and long term annual growth rates for each class of
consumer are summarized in Table 1.2. Energy sales since 1961 are analyzed
in Table 1.3.

Load Forecast
1.32    CEB compiles an annual energy sales forecast from forecasts of the
consumption of each class of consumer within each of CEB's geographical
divisions.  In so doing, historical trends are considered for each of the 23
areas which together make up the divisions.  Due weight is given to known
prospective loads such as housing schemes, industrial parks, commercial
areas, individual industries, commercial properties, and rural
electrification schemes. For longer term forecasting, correlation and
regression analyses are used. All consumers are divided into three
categories, and growth rates are related to gross domestic product, to value
added in mining and manufacturing and export processing, and to population.
To accommodate deviations from the trend, upper and lower limit estimates are
made.
1.33    CEB's power and energy forecast of August 1981 is summarized in Table
1.4 and is shown in greater detail in Annex 5.
Table 1.4:  ENERGY AND POWER DEMAND FORECAST

The energy sales figure for 1980 is an estimate of what consumption
in that year would have been if there had been no load shedding (the actual
was 1396 GWh), and this is used as the base for the forward projections.
Because of load shedding in 1981 the actual figure for 1981 will be less than
that shown, by an estimated 69 GWh. The figures do not provide for supplying
an extension to the Ceylon Cement Corporation-s factory, which will install
its own generation to supply about 90 GWh per year. The large increase from
1980 to 1981 and the strong growth forecast for the following four years are
supported by evidence of contracts signed and construction in progress.
1.34    The heavy load shedding experienced in 1980 and 1981 may have
repercussions on some of the planned enterprises included in the forecast.
Some slippage in the construction, commissioning and building up to full
scale operation of new industrial and commercial ventures can be expected.
CEB and GSL may be expected to try to reduce demand by promoting energy
savings in the operations of Government industries and the private sector, by
raising tariff demand charges and even by shutting down uneconomic operations
in critical periods. These and other measures may cause growth in demand to
lag behind CEB-s projections. For purposes of generation and transmission
planning, however, CEB's forecast is appropriate.



-11-
1.35    The growth of sales by class of consumer is summarized in Table 1.5.
It is forecast that growth in domestic consumption will be depressed by the
recent increases in tariff and by the fuel surcharge, and will fall from its
very high rates of recent years back to about 11% for the remainder of the
decade. Similarly, the rate of growth in consumption by local authorities,
whose consumers are mainly domestic and commercial, is expected to be
somewhat less than in recent years, and is taken to be about 10%.
1.36    Small and medium industries, defined as taking less than 1,000 kVA,
are projected to have an underlying growth from 1980 to 1984 of 6%, to which
is added the Greater Colombo Economic Commission's forecast for each year;
for 1985 and thereafter 8% growth is used. Consumption by large industries
is forecast to increase by 13.9% per year on average up to 1985. This is
explained mainly by the considerable number of projects expected to come to
fruition in 1981-83. The underlying growth for the period 1980-83 was taken
as 4% p.a., and after 1983, 8% was applied.
1.37    Commercial consumption is forecast to continue to grow rapidly in the
years up to 1986, as it has in the recent past. Up to 1986 an underlying
growth rate of 11% is expected, and to this is added the individual
consumptions of the expanded airport at Katunayake, the substantial loads
to be fed at the Urban Development Authority's developments in Colombo, and
the new Parliamentary complex at Kotte. After 1987 a rate of 10% is
estimated for all commercial consumers taken together.

II. THE BORROWER AND IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Lending Arrangements
2.01    CEB will be the borrower of the proposed loan (US$42.7 million
equivalent) and will be responsible for implementing the project (para 4.19).
Organization
2.02    CEB was established by the CEB Act, No. 17 of 1969 (1969 CEB Act)
as the successor to the Department of Government Electrical Undertakings
(DGEU) and is responsible for the development and coordination of the
generation, supply and distribution of electrical energy in Sri Lanka. While
CEB is a public corporation the 1969 CEB Act does not endow it with fully
autonomous powers and the government has reserved to itself a substantial
role in important policy matters and in particular tariffs, capital
investment, borrowing and the appointment of the Chairman and the General
Manager. The conditions of service of all CEB staff are subject to GSL
regulation.   CEB is also subject to the provisions of the Finance Act, No.
38 of 1971 (1971 Finance Act) which regulates the finances of all public
corporations in Sri Lanka.
2.03    CEB is a corporate body governed by a seven-member Board; members
serve a five-year term and may be reappointed. Board members are appointed
by GSL - four with experience in either engineering, commerce, administration
or accountancy, and the others representing local authorities, industry and
the Ministry of Finance - and may be removed at any time. The Chairman is
appointed from amongst the Board members. The present Chairman is also the
Secretary, Ministry of Power and Energy.
2.04    CEB-s organization structure was designed by consultants, Urwick
International Ltd., in the early 1970's under Loan 636-CE. While some
modifications have been made in recent years including the addition of two
posts of Additional General Manager, the original pattern is basically
unchanged. Changes were proposed by CEB as part of the general management
improvements now taking place in CEB (para 2.08). They would strengthen the
decentralization of CEB's operations while retaining key controls in Colombo.
So far the changes have not been introduced, partly as a result of the severe
operational difficulties CEB experienced in late 1981. CEB recently
requested a proposal from its management consultants for modifications to the
organizational structure to be implemented as part of their ongoing
assignment (para 2.10). This proposal is presently under review. The
assurance obtained under Credit 1210-CE that CEB will submit to 1)k, in
advance, any proposal for major change to CEB's organizational structuire was
repeated under the proposed project.



-13-
Management and Staffing
2.05    While the Chairman is responsible through the Board for policy
matters and close liaison with government, the General Manager is CEB's Chief
Executive Officer. He is responsible for the overall direction and control
of CEB's day-to-day business. The present General Manager was recently
promoted to the post and is an experienced and long-serving engineer. He is
presently assisted by an Additional General Manager, four Deputy General
Managers and a Finance Manager. With the exception of the Finance Manager,
who is not a fully qualified accountant but is a competent and long-serving
officer, all top management posts are filled by engineers. The Commercial
and Personnel Managers, Chief Internal Auditor (vacant), and the Legal
Officer all report directly to the General Manager. CEB-s present senior
management structure is set out in Annex 6.   Below this level, CEB
operations are decentralized and are controlled at plant (for generation)
and divisional level. Each of the seven operating divisions into which Sri
Lanka is organized is headed by a Divisional Manager, who is a qualified
engineer; the divisions are further divided into areas which are the primary
units for systems maintenance, meter reading and consumer services.
2.06    CEB has had considerable difficulty in retaining experienced staff in
recent years as many engineers and accountants have left for overseas or
private sector posts offering substantially higher monetary rewards. Salary
differentials for senior CEB staff do not adequately reflect the heavy
additional responsibilities of such posts.   The lack of experienced
engineering staff in the 30-45 year range is particularly noticeable at CEB.
While qualified accountants are now extremely difficult to recruit, recently
CEB has had some success in strengthening its finance staff with partly
qualified persons. These problems appear to be common to many public sector
enterprises in Sri Lanka.
2.07    CEB-s present manpower is about 11,000 against an authorized total
of about 14,000. Manpower has increased as follows in recent years:

Whilst CEB-s staff is large in relation to the size of its operations
and the number of consumers it serves, the rate of increase over the past
six years has been held to an average of 5.2% per year, which is reasonable
in view of an expanding program of works, a rural electrification program,
undertaken by force account, and the need to cover a high turnover of skilled
labor.
Management Systems
2.08    Comprehensive management information, accounting and budgeting
systems were introduced by CEB in 1973 following a study by consultants,
Urwick International Ltd., U.K. financed under Loan 636-CE. While the
systems are satisfactory and are relevant to CEB's operations, senior
management is not utilizing the information system, and this has resulted in
a lack of control of CEB-s activities. Staffing difficulties in recent years
have led to serious delays in the preparation of periodic management reports,
particularly financial reports. Present Bank Group reporting requirements,
outlined in Annex 7, are not being achieved. Internal audit arrangements
have never been satisfactorily established in CEB largely due to the
inability to recruit a Chief Internal Auditor. Considerable emphasis is now
being placed upon improved reporting and internal audit (paras 2.09 - 2.10).
2.09    In view of the acknowledged weaknesses in CEB's present management
arrangements, CEB agreed under the sixth power project (Credit 1048-CE) to
implement a program of management improvements. To this end, Urwick
International Ltd., were recalled to review the situation and, in particular,
the status of implementation of their earlier recommendations and the
effectiveness of management practices in certain specified areas and to
recommend a program of measures to restore CEB's managerial effectiveness.
2.10    This short assignment was completed irn February 1981 and
recommendations for the "restoration" phase cover (a) general management
advice, (b) restoration and further development (e.g. computerization) of
CEB's systems, and (c) the introduction of management development and
training programs. The restoration of management systems and the development
of training (para 2.11) are most urgent tasks and CEB has recently appointed
Urwick International Ltd., with their extensive background knowledge for this
purpose. The appointment of a general management advisor requires a person
experienced in power utility management and CEB will be discussing a number
of options with the Bank Group in the coming months. Funding is available
under Credit 1048-CE for the "restoration" program.
Training
2.11    CEB operates a residential training center at Castlereagh for
technicians which offers courses related to CEB's operations. Accommodation
is limited and CEB is planning to develop non-residential technical training



-1 5-
facilities in Colombo as a result of an earlier investigation by the National
Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Washington, D.C., financed under the
USAID program. Regular training programs are required to fit engineers for
managerial positions; prior to assuming responsibility for operating
facilities newly qualified engineers should receive six-months on-the-job
training: at present this requirement is not consistently achieved. There
is no program for progressive management development. Training programs are
also required to familiarize accounting staff with CEB's financial operations
and reporting requirements for financial control. CEB agreed under Credit
1048-CE to submit to IDA a satisfactory training program for all cadres of
CEB staff by June 30, 1981, and thereafter to implement an agreed program.
CEB has submitted an outline training program after discussions with the Bank
Group and following Urwick-s recent report. This proposal is now being
developed to suit CEB's needs. Provision to finance training expenditure is
made under the sixth and seventh power projects.
Local Authority Distribution Systems
2.12    While CEB supplies power directly to some 208,000 domestic,
commercial and industrial consumers throughout Sri Lanka, another 226,000
consumers are supplied by local authorities which purchase power in bulk from
CEB.The quality of local authority service to consumers is unsatisfactory
(para 1.25). GSL planned that CEB should assume responsibility for the
distribution facilities of the local authorities. CEB would take over all
staff, assets and liabilities relating to electricity supply. In view of
CEB's present managerial problems and the heavy additional burden such a
transfer would place on CEB, including its financial position, the transfer
is not now proceeding.
Audit
2.13    The present arrangements under Credit 1210-CE require CEB to submit
(a) unaudited accounts to IDA within four months of the year-end (the time
permitted by law for their submission to the Auditor General) and (b) the
Auditor General's report on the accounts within ten months of the year-end.
CEB's FY 1980 unaudited accounts were submitted for audit in May 1981, a
considerable improvement on earlier years, but the issue of the final audit
report was slightly delayed (November 1981). The above arrangements are
satisfactory and will continue under the proposed project.
Insurance
2.14    CEB has for a number of years borne its own insurable risks and has
established an Insurance Reserve to which an annual contribution of 1/10% of
gross fixed assets values is transferred from retained earnings. This
arrangement is satisfactory.

III. THE PROJECT
Objective
3.01    MASL is at present constructing new hydro power stations at Victoria
(210 MW, 686 GWh), Kotmale (134 MW, 310 GWh) and Randenigala (122 MW, 366
GWh). The first unit at Victoria is not scheduled for commissioning until mid
1984, and the first at Kotmale will not come in before mid 1985 at the
earliest. Randenigala will follow in 1986. Even if all these plants are
finished on schedule, Sri Lanka could experience shortages of power and
energy up to 1986 (paras 5.07 and 5.08). The objective of the project is to
prevent such shortages whilst providing plant of a type that will remain
economically justified throughout its normal life span. Studies of the
loading to be expected on the existing Kelanitissa steam plant, the existing
gas turbines and the proposed new station indicate that the least cost
solution is to equip the proposed plant with large diesel engines capable of
burning residual fuel oil at high efficiency (Annex 8).
Description
3.02    The project consists of a complete 80 MW diesel power station located
at Sapugaskanda in the outskirts of Colombo. The site of the station was
chosen mainly because it is adjacent to the CPC-s refinery, permitting the
heavy fuel oil to be delivered at minimum cost direct from refinery to power
station by a short heated pipeline, avoiding the cost and complication of
carrying it in heated vehicles. The site has good foundation conditions and
an adequate supply of water to permit the use of cooling towers. Access to
the site, including that needed for delivering heavy loads, is adequate. It
is located close to an existing 132 kV substation into which the output from
the new station can conveniently be fed.
Fuel Supply
3.03    CPC is prepared to enter into a long term contract to supply CEB with
residual fuel, of which it expects to have surplus supplies for the
forseeable future. The price will be Platt's Oilgram average for Arabian
Gulf Posting for High Sulphur Fuel Oil, less a discount of US$6.00 per tonne.
Based on Platt's postings for January 1982, this would make CEB's cost US$159
per tonne, the same as that already being paid in similar circumstances by
the Fertiliser Corporation. The comparable price for the distillate fuel
needed for gas turbines or combined cycle machines is US$330 per tonne. The
fuel cost for diesel engines using residual fuel is estimated to be about
RsO.68 per kWh, compared with Rsl.40 for combined cycle plant, and Rs2.1O for
open cycle gas turbines. The proposed diesels would assume the base load
that would otherwise have to be carried by the gas turbines.



-17-
Engineering, Procurement and Implementation
3.04    In order to permit contractors to make their most economical offers,
the specification called for a station of approximately 80 MW capacity, made
up of between four and eight units. The contractor will supply, erect and
construct the whole power station, including
Civil works
Buildings and foundations
Engines and auxiliaries
Piping
Power station crane
Building and site services
Generators and Transformers
132 kV, 11 kV and 400 kV switchgear
D.C. Equipment
Wiring, cabling and earthing
Site tests on completion
Staff training at manufacturers works
The short transmission link needed from the project site to the
existing Sapugaskanda 132 kV grid substation is not included in the project,
but will be constructed by CEB's own forces and financed under the Seventh
(Mahaweli Transmission) Power Project.
3.05    To ensure that the generators are brought on line by the target date,
the station will be supplied, constructed, commissioned and tested under one
single responsibility contract to be awarded after international competitive
bidding in accordance with IBRD guidelines. A contractor experienced in
projects of this type will be able to coordinate design, procurement and
construction so as to bring the first unit into service in October 1983, with
the others following at intervals of 2 to 4 weeks through February 1984. A
Construction Schedule is shown in Annex 9: tenders were opened on April 8,
1982 and are under evaluation.   CEB hope to award the contract by July 1982.
3.06    CEB were assisted in the preparation of the specifications and tender
documents by their foreign consultants, Preece, Cardew & Rider, U.K. who will
be responsible for contract administration, inspection and testing during
manufacture, and site supervision of construction of the works. The
engineering contract provides for about 200 man months of the foreign
engineers- and inspectors services at an average man-month cost (including
fees, international travel, subsistence, allowances and reimbursable foreign
costs) of US$7,500.



-18-
Project Cost
3.07    The estimated cost of the project is Rsl,107 (US$54.0 million),
including contingencies and customs duties (Table 3.1). The cost estimate is
based on tenders received and which are at present under evaluation. Since
the specification called for firm prices, no price contingency is provided,
but physical contingencies of 5% on foreign costs and 10% on local costs are
included to provide for any unforseen work that might become necessary.
Customs duties averaging 10% of the cost of foreign plant and materials were
allowed, and amount to 6% of the total project cost.

Project Financing Plan
3.08    The whole of the foreign cost of the project, estimated at US$42
million and representing 78% of the total project cost, will be financed by
the proposed IBRD loan. The whole of the local cost, estimated at Rs246
million (US$12 million), and being 22% of the total project cost, will be
financed by CEB from internally generated funds which are adequate for this
purpose (para 4.18).



-19-
Disbursements
3.09    The Loan will be disbursed against the following: -
(a) 100% of the foreign expenditures under the Sapugaskanda Power
Station Contract.
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures on engineering consultants.
A schedule of disbursements is provided in Annex 10: it assumes that the
Construction Schedule, which is one of the contract documents, will be
adhered to, and that the specified terms of payment will be met. The Bank
has no appropriate disbursement profile for this type of project, and the
schedule adopted calls for unusually rapid disbursement of the loan, but it
is consistent with the urgent need for the project to be completed on time,
and the expectation that CEB and their consultants will succeed in ensuring
that it is. It is recommended that retroactive financing not exceeding
US$4.2 million be authorised to cover payments for items (a) and (b) above
made after April 1, 1982 but before the signing of the proposed loan
agreement.
Land Acquisition
3.10    The proposed site of the diesel power station has already been
acquired by GSL. Soils investigation work was completed and a preliminary
report issued to tenderers early in February 1982.
Risks
3.11    The main risk associated with the project is that it will run late
and the added generating capacity will not be available when most needed at
the end of 1983.

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
CEB's Statutory Position
4.01    CEB's finances are regulated by the provisions of the 1969 CEB Act
and the 1971 Finance Act, which affects all public corporations in Sri Lanka.
CEB is required, by Section 38 of the 1969 CEB Act, to operate in a
commercial manner so as to ensure that revenues are sufficient to meet all
outgoings, including depreciation and interest, and a reasonable proportion
of development costs. CEB's statutory obligations were amended in two
important respects following IDA approval of Credit 372-CE in 1973: 1/
(a) CEB is permitted to charge depreciation in its accounts based
on a current valuation of fixed assets rather than the historic
cost of such assets.
(b) CEB-s obligation to pay an 8% annual dividend on GSL's equity
capital is waived each year until CEB has generated cash
equivalent to a 30% contribution to the combined annual
capital expenditure on electricity supply, including interest
during construction, of CEB and any other body responsible
for undertaking a joint scheme with CEB.
Past Financial Performance
4.02    CEB's actual financial operations for the five years to FY 1980 are
summarized in Table 4.1 below and are shown in greater detail in Annex 11.
1/    These conditions were repeated under the Credits 1048-CE and 1210-CE
and are retained under the proposed Project.

Investment Program            37%        43%        16%        67%       58%
CEB was required, under IDA Credit 372-CE, to maintain tariffs at
levels sufficient to produce, from FY 1974, at least an 8% annual rate of
return on currently valued net fixed assets in operation. In this respect
CEB's financial performance through FY 1978 was unsatisfactory mainly as a
result of unchanged tariff levels between April 1, 1972 and December 1, 1978.
CEB has, however, satisfactorily revalued its fixed assets through FY1980
using agreed local indices. In the seven years FY's 1972 through 1978
whereas the average cost of energy (including depreciation) per kWh rose by
58% from Rs 0.11 to 0.17 CEB's average sales revenue per kWh rose by only 20%
from Rs 0.15 to 0.18. Following a tariff increase on December 1, 1978, sales
revenue rose to Rs 0.30/kWh in FY 1979. Except for an unexpectedly large
a/   Operating expenses before depreciation divided by operating revenues.
b/   Following an initial valuation of CEB's fixed assets at January 1, 1972,
subsequent revaluations of fixed assets, using local indices agreed with
IDA, have been incorporated in CEB's accounts annually from FY's 1977
through 1980.



-22-
(37 1/2%) movement in the indices used for fixed asset revaluation, the
covenanted 8% rate of return would have been achieved, the actual being about
7%. Operating expenses increased in FY 1979 by about 32%, much less than
budgetted, bringing the average energy cost to Rs 0.20/kWh.
Present Financial Position
4.03    In order to achieve the 8% rate of return required by IDA, CEB was
required to make a further tariff increase as a condition of effectiveness of
Credit 1048-CE. From October 1, 1980, GSL authorized CEB (a) to increase
tariffs from an average Rs 0.30 to Rs 0.58/kWh and (b) to introduce a revised
fuel adjustment surcharge on all consumers so as to recover automatically the
monthly fuel cost of thermal generation (para 4.11). Following these
revisions CEB's rate of return on revalued assets in FY 1980 was about 9% and
is estimated at about 11% in FY 1981. This constitutes a very satisfactory
turnaround of CEB's finances since FY 1978.
4.04    CEB's financial position as at December 31, 1981, is estimated (Annex
15) as follows:

4.05    CEB's FY 1981 balance sheet indicates a highly satisfactory
debt/equity ratio of 18:82 (debt service was covered 6.4 times by earnings).
CEB's current ratio is estimated at 2.7 times but this will fall to about
two times in the 1980's.   CEB will have to maintain a tight control over the



-23-
level of consumer receivables (paras 4.06 - 4.10) and inventories to minimize
working capital requirements. 1/
Billing and Collection
4.06    CEB's billing and collection performance has been reasonably
satisfactory in recent years. Under Credit 1210-CE, CEB's consumer
receivables on the last day of each month should not exceed the aggregate
billings for the three months ending on the same day and this requirement
is retained under the proposed project.   CEB has made considerable efforts
to meet this target. The position at December 31, 1980 indicated receivables
equivalent to 3.2 months billings compared to 3.6 months billings at end FY
1978. As CEB-s revenues quadrupled in this short period the present
receivables position represents a commendable performance by CEB staff, given
the many difficulties associated with their task ranging from unreliability
of meter readings to computer bureau problems and inadequate physical
conditions.   CEB's management consultants (para 2.10) are presently
reviewing meter reading, billing and collection arrangements (including
computerization) in an effort to improve efficiency.
4.07    Some deterioraton in the position occurred in FY 1981 and it is
estimated that, at December 31 last, receivables represented about 4 months
billings. An analysis of consumer receivables estimated at end FY 1981 is
as follows:
1/  Under Credit 1048-CE,  CEB agreed to reduce inventories to a satisfactory
level by December 31, 1982 and GSL agreed to ensure the timely
availability of foreign exchange for inventories: materials management
problems have already been reviewed by CEB's management consultants and
action is being taken to improve controls. These conditions were
repeated under Credit 1210-CE and are retained under the proposed
project.

4.08    CEB has a separate unit to handle large consumers  accounts, which are
maintained on a manual system. The above table indicates that CEB is
maintaining a tight credit control over most large consumers, the
exception being the 218 local authorities which CEB supplies in bulk
and for street lighting, the latter being the responsibility of the Colombo
Municipal Council. Local authority billings to September 30, 1981, are at
pre-December 1978 tariffs by agreement between GSL and CEB. GSL was
billed separately in respect of the tariffs increases, including the fuel
surcharge, after December 1, 1978 and has paid to CEB all such amounts due
up to September 30, 1981.
4.09    GSL agreed, under Credit 1048-CE to ensure the timely payment
of future amounts owed by the local authorities to CEB together
with arrears in accordance with an agreed program. At that time GSL was
proposing to transfer the local authority systems to CEB and this led to a
deterioration in the local authority arrears position. Arrears would
have been settled as a part of the transfer arrangements. The transfer has
now been abandoned. An assurance was obtained, therefore, under Credit
1210-CE, that from October 1, 1981, the local authorities will pay the current
CEB tariffs for bulk supplies and introduce retail tariffs which are
sufficient to cover CEB's bulk supply charges and the local authorities
distribution costs. This requirement is retained under the proposed project
In the context of the further tariff increase by CEB from June 1, 1982
(para 4.13) the Bank Group has advised GSL and CEB recently of the need to
ensure, by retail tariff increases or by budgetary provision, the availability



-25-
to Government departments, public corporations and local authorities of
adequate funds to meet CEB's bills.
4.10    The bulk of CEB's billings are of relatively small amounts and
are maintained on computer. They constitute some 25% of CEB's billings
by amount. Over 50% of such monthly accounts are for less than Rs 15. The
difficulty of recruiting satisfactory meter readers poses a continuing
serious problem for CEB and leads to some delays in billing and problems in
collection.   CEB is experiencing difficulties in obtaining a reliable
bureau service to meet the growing volume of such bills. CEB is striving
for improved performance in this sector.
Revenues, Tariffs and Marginal Cost
4.11    The details of CEB's recent tariff structure are set out in Annex 12.
CEB's tariffs were unchanged between April 1972 and December 1978 but since
then the record has been very impressive.   Two tariff increases were
introduced from December 1978 and again from October 1980 which have raised
CEB's average tariff by about 260% from Rs 0.16 to 0.58/kWh (about 3 US
cents). 1/ A further tariff increase is due to take effect from June 1, 1982
as a condition of effectiveness for the Seventh (Mahaweli Transmission) Power
Project. This will raise the average tariff, inclusive of fuel surcharge, to
the equivalent of about US cents 9/kWh.    In addition to raising tariff
levels in recent years, which has enabled it to meet financial rate of return
criteria, CEB has also made significant structural improvements to its
tariffs. Domestic consmers now pay higher block tariffs and non-domestic
tariffs have been rationalized. Further, from October 1, 1980, CEB is
recovering automatically the cost of fuel needed for CEB's increasing
thermal generation by way of a surcharge on consumers' monthly bills. The
first 200 units of domestic consumption (equivalent to a maximum charge of
US$ 5) are exempt from the surcharge and this exempts over 90% of domestic
consumers.   The exemption limit will be reduced to 150 units a month
from June 1, 1982.
4.12    CEB agreed under Credit 1048-CE to carry out a study of long run
marginal cost (LRMC) pricing with technical assistance from the Bank,
and to implement any agreed recommendations. This study should have been
completed by December 31, 1980 but staffing constraints in particular
have led to delay and it was agreed to extend the deadline by one year to
December 31, 1981. Preliminary results of the study were discussed
during negotiations for the Seventh power project in November 1981 and
further refinements were agreed for the results to be useful for tariff

cents/kwh. in 1981.



-26-
restructuring. These have since been made and, following further
discussions with the Bank Group in January 1982 agreed proposals for major
structural improvements along LRMC lines were submitted to GSL as part of the
report tariff revision (para 4.13). This represents a significant step
by incorporating economic considerations in tariff setting and would result
in an average tariff 1/ equivalent to about two-thirds of LRMC compared
to about 45% at present.   While the financial projections (table 4.5)
show the average revenue declining in real terms over time as the share
of thermal generation in the system declines, it is unlikely that tariff
levels would fall to the present percentage of LRMC. Marginal cost is
likely to decrease over time for the same reason. At negotiations CEB
agreed to update the tariff study periodically and make the results
available to the Bank Group for review and comments prior to implementation.
4.13    The results of the tariff study indicate that LRMC of power supply
in the CEB system ranges from about Rs 1.70/kWh to about Rs 3.50/kWh,
depending on voltage of supply and consumption pattern. The sales-weighted
average LRMC is calculated to be about Rs 2.60/kWh. Although these results
necessarily are subject to a large error margin because of their sensitivity
to basic assumptions about future operations, the tariff study is satisfactory
and provides CEB with a useful broad indicator for long-term cost recovery.
While tariff restructuring is proposed according to LRMC principles, lifeline
rate requirements for low-income domestic consumers and the special problems
of bulk supply to local authorities will also be recognized. Tariffs
(including fuel surcharge) for industrial and commercial consumers will now
be close or equivalent to LRMC levels and structure. Domestic tariffs for
consumption above 150 kWh/month will be equivalent to 70-80% of LRMC, while
lower consumption block tariffs will taper down to a lifeline rate. Local
authority tariffs will be patterned on domestic tariffs because of their
nature as suppliers of low-voltage retail consumers.
4.14    An assurance was obtained at negotiations that CEB will continue,
as previously, to review tariffs annually, before the start of each financial
year to ensure that revenues are sufficient to meet operating expenses, including
fuel and depreciation, and to produce at least an 8% rate of return on
currently valued net fixed assets.   While the presently agreed rate of return
is 8%, CEB-s tariff increase from June 1, 1982 will produce a rate of return
of 12% in FY 1982 and 9% in FY 1983. This will generate sufficient internal
resources to meet the local costs of CEB's approved investment program
through FY 1985. From FY 1985 onwards further tariff increases will be
required to enable CEB at least to maintain the covenanted 8% rate of return:
the amount of such increases will depend to a great extent upon the size of
CEB's future investment program.

Transfer of Assets from MASL
4.15    The 1969 Act authorizes CEB to enter into "joint schemes" with other
agencies for the generation of electricity. The Act does not detail the
arrangements for the transfer and operation of assets created under such
schemes. Subsequently, under Credit 372-CE, GSL agreed to ensure that CEB is
sufficiently involved on the formulation of all future joint schemes, and that
the power assets are transferred on completion to CEB on terms satisfactory to
IDA. This was done in the case of the 38 MW Ukuwela hydro station constructed
under the Mahaweli Ganga Stage I (para 1.11(g)). Most of the hydro-power
development in the 1980's in Sri Lanka will be carried out under the Accelerated
Mahaweli Program. CEB is not required to contribute to the costs of these
schemes during the construction phase but ownership will be transferred to
CEB on their completion. The need for adequate co-ordination between CEB and
MASL in the design and construction of these facilities was discussed in the
context of the Sixth and Seventh Power Projects. CEB is not represented on
the MASL Board and such representation would require legislation.  However,
technical co-ordination between the two agencies is satisfactory. GSL agreed
under Credit 1210-CE to ensure proper future co-ordination between CEB and
any other agency involved in a joint scheme. Furthermore, in view of the
major impact that the Victoria and Kotmale assets will have on CEB's finances,
GSL and CEB have agreed a satisfactory provisional basis for the transfer of
these assets. (Annex 17 para 14).
Financing Plan (FYs 1982-85)
4.16    CEB's presently approved investment program through FY 1985
comprises the ongoing ADB-assisted Bowatenne, Canyon and Rural Electrification
projects, the IDA-assisted Sixth (transmission and distribution), Seventh
(Mahaweli transmission) and proposed Eighth (Diesel) projects, and various
small system augmentation works.
4.17    CEB has not, in past years, been liable to pay income tax.  However,
from April 1981 the basis of annual depreciation allowances used in the
computation of tax liability has been changed. In future CEB will be entitled
to claim a 12 1/2% depreciation allowance on newly commissioned assets over
an eight year period as compared to the previous 100% allowance in the first
year. Consequently, it is estimated that CEB may incur a tax liability
totalling Rs 535 million in FY's 1982/83 but thereafter the
transfer of major hydro-stations will create tax losses to be carried forward
to subsequent years. As part of the recent tariff discussion (para 4.13)
GSL has agreed to return to CEB, in the form of equity capital, the
amount of any such income tax payments in FYs 1982/83.

satisfactory, are summarized in Table 4.5. The fluctuation in CEB's average
revenue in future years results from the operation of the fuel adjustment
clause and the fluctuation in the projected level of fuel consumption.

V. JUSTIFICATION
Background
5.01    CEB had to carry out extensive load shedding in 1980 (50 GWh) and 1981
(69 GWh), owing to lower than average rainfall, breakdowns of existing
plant, and delays in commissioning some of the 6 gas turbines installed
between late 1980 and early 1982 (para 1.24). The power shortages caused widespread
disruption, losses and inconvenience, and both GSL and CEB were anxious to
avoid any further repetition of them. Although new hydro stations were
under construction at Bowatenne, Canyon, Victoria, Kotmale and Rendenigala,
it was evident from the load forecasts that further power shortages could be
expected in 1982, 83 and 84 before the larger new hydro stations started to
come on line. CEB therefore carried out studies in 1981 based on their then
current load forecast, and concluded that, in addition to the gas turbines
then being installed, a further 120 MW of thermal plant would be required to
avoid the possibility of a serious shortage in 1984.
Least-Cost Solution
5.02    To determine the optimum type of plant, the study compared three
possibilities: -
(a) The addition of 120 MW of residual fuel burning (rfb) diesels.
(b) The addition of 100 MW of rfb diesels, and also 20 MW of steam
plant using the exhaust gases of 40 MW of existing gas turbines,
forming 60 MW of combined cycle plant.
(c) The addition of 80 MW of rfb diesels, and also 40 MW of steam
plant using the exhaust gases of 80 MW of existing gas turbines,
forming 120 MW of combined cycle plant.
The study considered the additional capital costs of each alternative, and
the fuel costs for the whole system when incorporating each of the
alternatives, over a period of ten years.
5.03    It was found that with the fuel costs adopted at that time, the
present values of the streams of capital and operating costs for each of the
three alternatives differed by less than 2%, or much less than the margin of
error of the data. Since no clear choice between the available types of
thermal plant emerged from that cost study, other factors were considered,
and GSL and CEB elected to purchase diesels, mainly because they would burn
residual fuel which would be in excess supply in Sri Lanka for the forseeable
future, and which would otherwise have to be exported. Gas turbines and
combined cycle plant need distillate fuel, of which Sri Lanka must import a
large part of its needs.



-32-
5.04    Because of the Bank's insistence on the preparation of a properly
optimised least cost long term generation program, CEB planning staff
assisted by Bank personnel carried out further studies later in 1981 in
Washington, using the Wien Automatic System Planning (WASP) computer program.
The main object of these studies was to evaluate various options for
expanding CEB's system to meet the predicted load growth over the next 15
years, and hence to determine the type and sizes of plant which should be
installed, and when, to form the long run least cost program. At the same
time, the roles to be played in this program by the gas turbines and diesels
that were forced into the system in the present period of shortages were
examined.
5.05    Later in 1981, after review by a Bank energy mission, CEB adopted a
new reduced demand forecast. The demands for 1984, for example, were reduced
by 47 MW and 225 GWh. As a result of this, CEB and GSL decided to install
only 80 MW of rfb diesels instead of 120 MW. Using experience gained in the
WASP study, the energy expected to be generated by each type of plant was
revised. This clearly displayed the major role to be played in the long term
by the proposed diesel plant (Annex 8).
5.06    Since the estimated capital cost of the rfb diesels is not much
different from that of the combined cycle, whilst the fuel cost of the
diesels is much lower, and because the open cycle gas turbines will receive
little use after 1984, it is evident that the least cost solution is to
provide the whole 80 MW by diesels. To illustrate this, in Annex 8 two cases
are compared, Case A having all diesels, and Case B having the minimum amount
of combined cycle. A third possibility, Case C, indicates the much higher
cost of operating gas turbines only, and shows that in the conditions
specified the diesels would pay for themselves by way of fuel savings in
about 2 years. With average hydro flows, which are somewhat higher, it would
take longer.
Power Balances
5.07    After the addition of a total of 120 MW of gas turbines in 1980/82
and the Canyon hydro plant (30 MW, 130 GWh) at the end of 1982, the effective
capacity installed on CEB's system will amount to 553 MW. To arrive at the
reliable capacity for peaking, it is necessary to deduct the largest hydro
unit (50 MW), one gas turbine (20 MW), and one steam turbine (20 MW).
Without the project there could be substantial power deficits, particularly
in 1984, as shown in Table 3.1.

The probable peak deficit in 1984 would thus be reduced from 24% to 10%,
which should be manageable without extensive disruption of supplies.
Energy Balances
5.08    Since the hydro stations are operated in integration and there is
an appreciable amount of thermal plant on the system, studies have shown it
to be feasible to consider about 25% of the secondary hydro energyl/ as firm
with a probability of about 94%. For study purposes CEB takes the energy
capability of each plant to be its firm capability plus 25% of its secondary
energy. The first six months of the year in Sri Lanka are a dry period
during which the hydro reservoir levels fall, whilst the second six months
are a wet period during which reservoirs fill, and if hydro planning is to be
reliable it is necessary to consider each period separately. When this is
done the short term energy balances without the proposed 80 MW of diesels
appear in Table 3.2. For this purpose it was assumed that the gas turbines
would achieve a plant factor of 60%.

total energy requirement.  All deficits could be met by the proposed 80 MW of
plant, operated at a maximum plant factor of 68% in the second half of 1984.
Economic Rate of Return

increased by a notional transmission and distribution component, and compared
to benefit proxies ranging from tariff revenue only to estimates of
consumers willingness to pay for energy (including part of consumers'
surplus). All benefit estimates are applied to incremental energy sales from
the project after system losses. Tariff revenue is calculated constant at
the 1983 level and fluctuating over time in real terms. The upper limit of
benefit valuation is estimated as the cost of using alternative energy
sources. Calculations are performed with fuel costs increasing over time in
real terms. Costs and benefits are expressed in CIF or equivalent border
prices, local values are converted to border prices using a shadow/market
wage ratio and a standard conversion factor (Annex 8).
5.10    The minimum rate of return, assuming valuation of incremental
incremental demand at the tariff level, is 14%. With variations of capital
cost by 30% up or down, this rate decreases to 7% and increases to 25%,
respectively. If a portion of consumers surplus beyond this minimum is
estimated, the rate of return increases to 34%. A variation of capital cost
in this case by plus or minus 30% yields a range of rates of return between 2
and 58%.

ANNEX 3
SRI LANKA
EIGHTH (DIESEL) POWER PROJECT
Existing Transmission and Distribution Systems
220 kV System
1.      Under the Seventh Project (Credit 1210-CE) a 220 kV system is being
built to transmit from the Mahaweli hydro stations, Victoria, Kotmale and
Rendenigala, into Colombo. A 220 kV substation will be established at
Biyagama, in the outskirts of Colombo, fed by a double circuit line 70 km
long from Kotmale. From Biyagama three 220 kV double circuit lines will run
to substations at Kelanitissa (16 km), Pannipitiya (17 km), and Katunayake
(23 km).
2.      The 220 kV link from Rantembe/Randenigala to Victoria is being
provided under the Randenigala project, and that from Victoria to Kotmale
is being provided under the Victoria project.
132 kV System
3.      The 132 kV system comprises 569 miles of line, of which 361 miles
are double circuit and 208 miles single circuit.
4.      At the heart of the system are the two largest hydro generating
stations, Polpitiya and Laksapana, connected together by four 132 kV
circuits. Wimalasurendra hydro station at Norton Bridge is also connected to
Laksapana by a short double circuit line.
5.      The largest load centre is at Kolonnawa near Colombo; it is fed by
four circuits from Polpitya. There are tees off these lines to substations
at Thulhiriya and Oruwala. Also feeding into Kolonnawa are two circuits from
the steam units and gas turbines at Kelanitissa power station.
6.      From the bars at Kolonnawa a single circuit runs south to a
substation at Ratmalana, whilst another double circuit runs north up the
coast to substations at Sapugaskande, Katunayaka, Bolowatta and Puttalam.
From Polpitiya a double circuit runs north up the middle of the island as far
as Anuradhapura, from where it continues as a single circuit by way of
Kilinochchi substation to Chunnakam in the northernmost part of the country.
Between Polpitiya and Anuradhapura there is a substation at Ukuwela, into
which the line from the Bowatenne hydro station feeds, and another at
Habarana. From Anuradhapura a single circuit tap takes off to Trincomalee on
the east coast. Starting from the busbars at Laksapana, a double circuit
line runs down as far as Galle on the south coast, with substations along the
way at Balangoda and Deniyaya.



-39-
7.      The 132 kV system is being reinforced and extended.  Second circuits
are being strung on existing towers from Anuradhapura to Chunnakam, from
Anuradhapura to Kantalai, and from Kolonnawa to Ratmalana. A new single
circuit line is being built from Kantalai to Valachchenai, and at
Valachchenai a new grid substation will be constructed. The foregoing work
is financed under the Sixth Power Project (Credit 1048-CE) and is scheduled
for construction in 1981-1984. Other extensions to be built in the same
period are a double circuit from Pannipitya to Neboda and a single circuit
from Canyon to Laksapana.
8.      Under the Seventh Project (Credit 1210-CE) the system is being
further reinforced with a 132 kV line from Rantembe to Badulla, which will
permit power from the Mahaweli stations to be injected at Badulla into the
old 66 kV system, and also permit the line Badulla to Inginiyagala to be
operated at 132 kV.
66 kV System
9.      The system consists of about 214 miles of double circuit line
associated with the earliest power developments. In the old Laksapana
station there are 66 kV busbars connected to Kolonnawa receiving station by a
double circuit line, which also feeds substations at Padukka and Avissawela.
Another double circuit from Laksapana runs east to substations at Norton
Bridge, Nuwara Eliya and Badulla. From Badulla a single circuit continues
east as far as the hydro station at Inginiyagala; this section was
constructed for 132 kV but is at present operated at 66 kV. A third line
originating at Laksapana carries two circuits north as far as Kandy. From
there to Kurunegala there is a double circuit built for 132 kV but operated
at 66 kV.
10.     The 66 kV system is interconnected with the 132 kV system by interbus
transformers at Kolonnawa and Laksapana.
Subtransmission and Distribution
11.     Most of the country is served by a system of about 3,250 route miles
of overhead lines at 33 kV, and 750 miles at 11 kV. Important points have
alternative supply routes. Most of the 132 kV substations are interlinked by
33 kV subtransmission lines to facilitate maintenance. Under the Sixth Power
Project about 500 miles of 33 kV subtransmission lines will be added.
12.     The city of Colombo draws its power at 33 kV from Kolonnawa, where
there are three 30 MVA transformers. Four 33/11 kV substations designated A,
B, C and D are connected to Kolonnawa and to each other by about 28 miles of
underground cable. Each of these substations serves its own 11 kV ring. The
rings are normally open so that each is effectively two radial feeders, so as
to simplify protection. Most of the 11 kV/400 V substations on these rings
contain two 500 MVA transformers each.  Ring A serves a predominantly



-40-
domestic market, while the central ring B serves the main commercial and port
areas. Ring C covers the mainly industrial part to the north of Colombo,
whilst D serves other areas of domestic and commercial consumers. There is
some overhead LT distribution in Colombo, but most is done by underground
cables. Radial feeders from the substations supply feeder pillars, from
where distribution cables run out and are tapped for consumer service
connections.
13.     The four primary substations in Colombo are nearing the limit of
their capacity. Under the Sixth Power Project two new bulk supply
substations will be established, each containing two 30 MW, 132/11 kV
transformers, fed by underground cables from Kelanitissa and Kolonnawa. At
the same time two of the existing substations will be increased in capacity
by the addition of 12.5 MVA transformers, and the ll kV underground cable
network will be modified appropriately.

Thermal Generation Costs
CEB's expected thermal energy generation by type of plant for the
years 1984 to 1995 as derived from the WASP study of July 1981 and subse-
quently modified to comply with the reduced load forecast of August 1981 is
given in the table on page 3. This tabulation was prepared considering each
half year, but here has been simplified to show only full years. The 40 MW
of Kelanitissa steam units and the 120 MW of gas turbines already exist, and
the table assumes that the 80 MW of diesels of the project have been added.
The costs for two main alternatives are compared in the tabulation
on page 4. Case A assumes the whole of the additional 80 MW to be diesels
capable of burning residual fuel, as proposed in the project and shown on
page 3. For comparison, Case B is also considered, in which it is assumed
that there will be a new 40 MW diesel station, but also that boilers will be
added to the exhausts of four of the existing gas turbines, generating steam
enough to drive two 20 MW steam turbines, thus forming a combined cycle plant
of 120 MW. In each case the added capacity totals 80 MW.
The generation from the hydro stations and the Kelanitissa steam
units are conmon to both cases. Thus for this purpose it is sufficient to
compare on the one hand the costs arising from loading the 80 MW of diesels
as far as possible and filling in with the open cycle gas turbines as
necessary (Case A), and on the other hand loading the 40 MW of diesels as
fully as possible and meeting the remaining energy demand with the combined
cycle plant (Case B). The predicted increase in the real cost of fuel of 3%
per annum would be applicable to both cost streams and would not affect the
result and has therefore been omitted.
Capital costs were taken as $625 per kilowatt for the diesels,
and $750 kW for the boilers and turbines needed to form the combined cycle
plant. The local component of these costs (17%) was subdivided 50/50
between labour and materials and shadow priced using standard indices.
Fuel and operation and maintenance costs per kWh generated were
calculated as follows: -

A partly developed Case C is shown for comparison, giving the
estimated operating costs on the assumption that gas turbines were used to
generate the energy otherwise allocated to diesels or combined cycle, and
it is seen that under the conditions assumed the operating cost savings due
to the diesels would repay their capital cost in less than two years. The
generation of 1,011 GWh in 1984 would require the gas turbines to achieve
the improbable plant factor of 96%. Case C is not further developed,
because in the absence of a new diesel or combined cycle plant the loading
on CEB's other stations would not remain as assumed in this study.
The results of the comparison of Cases A and B, tabulated on page 4,
demonstrate that all diesel alternative is the cheaper.

ANNEX 17
SRI LANKA
EIGHTH (DIESEL) POWER PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.         Financial projections of CEB's activities have been prepared for
the period through FY 1988 using, as a base, CEB's FY 1979 audited and FY
1980 unaudited accounts.
INCOME STATEMENT
REVENUES (Annex 13)
2.      Energy sales are taken from the "Load Forecast through 1990" (Annex
4) with the exceptions of (i) FY 1981 where sales have been reduced by 100
CWh to 1695 GWh to reflect supply interruptions during the year.
3.      The present average tariff is Rs 0.58/kWh.  An increase to Rs
O.79/kWh has been approved to take effect from June 1, 1982 to enable CEB
to generate sufficient cash to meet its contribution to the present
investment program. From FY 1985 tariffs have been projected at a rate
sufficient to enable CEB to continue to meet the covenanted 8% rate of return
on currently valued net fixed assets.
4.      The Fuel Adjustment Surcharge is included under "Other Operational
Revenues" and is assumed to recover, in full, the fuel cost of thermal
generation together with the 2% turnover tax levied on CEB's sales revenues.
OPERATING COSTS
5.      Operating and maintenance costs of power generation, transmission
and distribution in FYs 1979/80 were equivalent to about 2% of gross fixed
assets in operation at previous December 31 and have been projected on this
basis, taking into account newly commissioned plant.
6.      Full costs are based on the projected annual thermal energy require-
ments indicated at Annex 1, with escalation of prices at 8% annually through
FY 1985 and 6% annually thereafter.
7.      Turnover Tax is assessed at 2% of the current year's sales revenues.
CEB will probably be liable to Income Tax in FYs 1982/83 but thereafter
depreciation allowances will produce tax losses.
8.      Administration costs are increased from FY 1981 by 20% in FY 1982,
15% in FY 1983 and 10% annually thereafter.



-62-
9.      Depreciation is calculated at 2 3/4% of annually revalued gross fixed
assets in operation with a half year's allowance for assets commissioned
during the year.
10.     Annual contributions to CEB's Insurance Fund (1/10th of gross fixed
assets) are included under operating and maintenance costs (paragraph 5).
11.     Provision for bad and doubtful debts is a nominal RS 15 million
annually.
FLOW OF FUNDS STATEMENT (Annex 14)
12.     CEB's investment program is set out in Annex 16:  the position
through FY 1985 is as approved by GSL including the proposed 80 MW diesel
project. Beyond FY 1985 the investment program is very tentative and a block
provision has been included in the years FY 1986 through FY 1988 based upon
CEB's preliminary assessment of requirements, through FY 1990 at 1981 prices.
13.     CEB's financing plan through FY 1985 comprises existing commitments
by way of GSL equity/loan in respect of ongoing projects including the IDA-
assisted sixth and seventh projects together with the proposed Bank loan for
the 80 MW diesel. GSL Equity representing the reinvestment of income tax
payments is included in FYs 1982/83. The balance of funds will come from
CEB's internal resources. From FY 1986 GSL loans are assumed at 65% of the
investment program (terms: 10 years, 10% interest). Consumer contributions
of Rs.125 million annually are assumed through FY 1990. assumed through FY
1990.
14.     Transfer of Mahaweli Assets
On completion of the various projects the power components will be
transferred to CEB for operation and maintenance. Adjustments will be made
in CEB's accounts to reflect this transfer, including an agreed proportion of
the common costs (e.g. dams): Sums included in the financial projections
are:
Rs Million         Year
Victoria                       3,300            1984

Randenigala                   3,600             1987
CEB will become responsible for servicing an equivalent amount of
debt from the year following full commissioning of each scheme. Such loans
are repayable at 10% interest over 30 years.

BALANCE SHEET (Annex 15)
Fixed Assets
15.     CEB's fixed assets have been revalued to FY 1980 in accordance with
the movement of indices previously agreed with IDA. Thereafter, annual
revaluations have been projected based upon current guidelines of price
escalation for foreign and local goods: from FY 1981 through 1984 by 15%,
13%, 11% and 10%, and by 8% annually thereafter.
16.     Work-in-progress represents capital expenditure under the proposed
project and other CEB projects indicated at paragraph 12 above; transfers
have been made to the fixed asset account on commissioning of new facilities.
Current Assets
17.     The following assumptions have been made:
(a) Accounts receivable: equivalent to 3 months' billings.
(b) Inventories are to be reduced to "more reasonable levels" by
December 31, 1982 l/ and thereafter maintained at these levels;
in the meantime the level at end FY 1980 is escalated annually
using current Bank international price guidelines.
(c) Sundry Receivables have been reduced in FY 1981 by the aiaount
of GSL arrears in respect of local authority tariffs and
projected using the latest escalation rates.
(d) Rechargeable works outstanding have been escalated annually
in accordance with the percentage issued for fixed asset
revaluation (paragraph 15).
Equity
18.     Equity comprises CEB's initial capital, as increased from time to
time by GSL grants towards construction costs income tax (paragraph 7),
consumer contributions, revaluation surplus and retained earnings
(operational surplus).

Long-term Debt
19.     Long-term debt comprises (a) existing GSL loans to CEB including
those made under onlending arrangements with IBRD, IDA, ADB, OPEC and the
Saudi Fund (to cover foreign costs of previous and ongoing projects), and
(b) loans required in accordance with paragraph 13 above to fund CEB's
investment program through 1988.
20.     Current Liabilities comprise accounts payable, deposits and sundry
items which have been adusted annually for price escalation and current
maturities of long-term loans (representing amortization due in the following
fiscal year).

Economic Rate of Return
Economic Costs
1.      Cost items are valued at CIF or equivalent border prices, where
available. The remaining local costs are split into labor and other local
cost components, and adjusted by a shadow/market wage ratio of 0.67, and by a
standard conversion factor of 0.91.
2.      The foreign (CIF) and local (domestic price) components of new
capacity are estimated to be as follows:
Foreign (%) Local (%) of which Labor (%)
Thermal generation               83             17           8.5
Transmission & Distribution       68            32           25.5
O & M - Thermal generation        90            10            7
- T & D                     -            100           50
3.      Operating and maintenance expenditure for transmission and
distribution is assumed to amount to 3% of cumulative investment, for
gasturbines to Rs 0.50/kWh, and for diesel operation Rs 0.20/kWh. Fuel cost
of thermal plants is based on early 1982 international prices 1/. The fuel
cost amounts to Rs 0.67/kWh for diesel thermal plant, and Rs. 2.11/kWh for
gas turbines. A 3% p.a. increase in real terms is assumed as the base case
for fuel cost.
Economic Benefits
4.      Benefits of electricity supply accruing to final consumers are
assessed as the willingness to pay for a given quantity of energy for
specific purposes, expressed in CIF terms or border price equivalent.
Analysis of this willingness to pay is based on (i) tariff revenue, and (ii)
observed expenditure on alternative energy sources in the absence of
electricity supply. The sum of revenue and consumer surplus is estimated as
the area under the derived demand curve for energy required for output
production or lighting.
1/ Residual fuel oil: US$159/tonne FOB Colombo; Distillate: US$330/tonne CIF
Colombo.



Domestic electricity consumption
5.      Almost 90% of Sri Lanka households are using kerosene lamps for
lighting; in rural areas, this percentage rises to 97%. Domestic uses of
electricity other than lighting are limited (with the exception of the
Colombo metropolitan area): about 85% of total domestic electricity
consumption is estimated to be used for lighting purposes. In the absence
of electricity supply, households would use kerosene: the total amount of
lighting, however would be significantly lower due to the high cost of the
kerosene alternative. About 15% of present total domestic electricity use
can be considered minimum lighting requirements. This portion is valued at
the economic cost of Rs 6.16 per kWh equivalent. The remainder of
consumption is assumed to be valued at a price declining to Rs 1.51/kWh (the
expected average domestic tariff revenue including fuel surcharge, assumed to
represent the lower limit of willingness to pay in real terms from 1983
onwards). These values are applied to CEB-supplied domestic consumption as
well as to that part of the "bulk supply" to municipalities that is estimated
to be domestic use.
Low-voltage Commercial (General Purpose) Consumption
6.      As with domestic consumption, it is assumed that 15% of electricity
consumption would be replaced by kerosene lighting, the remainder declining
in value to the consumer up to the margin of about Rs 2.13/kWh, the average
commercial tariff revenue including fuel surcharge. Domestic and commercial
consumption together (including their shares of CEB "bulk supply") account
for about 44% of total electricity consumption.
Industrial, High-voltage Commercial, and Hotel Consumption
7.      For most of these consumers, the alternative to power supply is own
diesel generation, in the form of maintaining a standby generating set for
protection against power outages. This safeguard has become quite common in
recent years, as power cuts have increased. In the absence of the project,
there would be substantial daytime cuts necessary (particularly during 1983,
1984, and 1985, and to a smaller extent in the following years) to preserve
limited energy during the dry season. An average utilization of a standby
set of about 500 hours per year would be necessary in this case. The average
economic cost of operating a standby generating set for 15 years at this rate
is estimated to be Rs 2.80/kWh.
8.      Using this value for an estimated 10% of total incremental
consumption of these consumers, the valuation of the remaining consumption
declines to the average expected tariff of about Rs 1.90/kWh for industry and
large commercial consumers. The anticipated average tariff for hotels is
approximately equal to the maximum value.



-67-
9.      The total economic weighted value of a unit of incremental
consumption can be summarized as follows:
% of
Consumer Category            Consumption                Value (Rs/kWh) 1/
Domestic/LV Commercial            7                           6.16
Domestic                         18                           1.37
LV Commercial                    21                           1.94
Ind./Large Comm.                  5                           2.80
Ind./Large Comm.                 47                           1.73
Hotels                            2                           2.80
Weighted                                                      2.09
Although the cost assumptions (para 3) provide for a real increase in fuel
cost, it may not be valid to assume that the upper limit of willingness to
pay would increase correspondingly. Accordingly, the fuel cost component
of benefits is held constant in real terms.
10.     The average CEB tariff revenue, based on financial performance
criteria, is expected to reach Rs 1.86/kWh (including fuel surcharge) in
1983. Although Table 45 shows fluctuations due to the expected application
of a variable surcharge, the observed willingness to pay reached at that
point is expected to be maintained in real terms. In economic terms, the
average tariff is Rs 1.69/kWh.
Transmission and Distribution Cost
11.     A notional component of transmission and distribution investment is
added to the project cost, to enable comparison of costs and benefits at
retail level. Based on the Sri Lanka power sector development program, this
