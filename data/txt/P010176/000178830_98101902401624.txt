EIGHTH (DIESEL) POWER PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).
Guarantor:                The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
Amount:                   US$42.7 million equivalent, including the
capitalized front-end fee of about US$0.7 million.
Terms:                    20 years, including a grace period of 2 years with
interest at 11.6% per annum.  The Government of
Sri Lanka (GOSL) would bear the foreign exchange risk.
The Borrower would pay GOSL a guarantee fee of 1%
per annum.
Project Description:    The project aims at constructing an 80 MW diesel
station as a least cost solution to help CEB meet
both the short-term power shortage through mid-1984
and the long-term need for thermal generation
through 1990. Main components of the project are:
(1) engines and generators; (2) electrical plant and
equipment; (3) civil works; and (4) technical services
including engineering consultancy.
The main risk associated with the project is that it
will run late and the added generation capacity will
not be available when most needed from the end of 1983.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONTSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD FOR AN
EIGHTH (DIESEL) POWER PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) with the guarantee of the Democratic
Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka in an amount of US$42.7 million equivalent to
help finance an Eighth (Diesel) Power Project. The loan would have a term of
20 years, including 2 years of grace, with interest at 11.6% per annum. The
Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) would bear the foreign exchange risk. GOSL
would charge CEB a guarantee fee of 1% per annum on the outstanding amount of
the Bank loan.
PART I - TIIE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report, "Economic Adjustment in Sri Lanka:
Issues and Prospects" (Report No. 3901-CE, May 27, 1982), was distributed to
the Executive Directors on May 27, 1982. Country data are provided in
Annex I.
3.        After several years of relative stagnation, Sri Lanka's economy
has experienced sustained growth. This growth has been the direct result
of the economic liberalization of 1977, and the development push associated
with it. Until 1977, Sri Lanka's growth performance had been below both need
and potential. Although GDP growth in the 1960s, at 4.4% per annum, was
above the average for low income countries, it slackened sharply in the
1970-77 period to 2.9% per annum, just below the average for low income
countries. Through much of this period, the terms of trade deteriorated
steadily, eroding even these modest gains; as a consequence, per capita gross
national income rose by a mere 0.9% per annum during the 1970-76 period. The
slowdown in economic growth in the 1970-77 period was attributable to a
combination of factors, including inadequate investment, poor management of
the economy, and a policy environment not conducive to growth and investment;
these factors were compounded by poor weather in some years and a sharp rise
in the cost of imported food and petroleum.
4.        The three tree crops--tea, rubber, and coconuts--which are still
the mainstay of the economy, suffered from low replanting and inadequate
incentives.   These problems were exacerbated by a dual exchange rate system,
introduced in 1968, that discriminated against these crops, and by the uncer-
tainties surrounding a protracted nationalization (1972-75) of the larger
estates. After the exceptional output growth of the 1960s, rice yields and
cropping intensities declined in the 1970-77 period due to poor institutional
support. Investment in manufacturing was also low, and the inefficiency of



- 2 -
most public and private sector firms, nurtured in a highly protected environ-
ment, resulted in growth of manufacturing of 1% per annum. The only bright
spots were subsidiary food crops and industrial exports which benefited from
good incentives.
5.         An inadequate public savings effort, caused by inelastic revenues
and uncontrolled growth in recurrent expenditures, inhibited public invest-
ment.  Unfavorable policies further constrained private savings.  The slow
growth rates and changes in the structure of output provided neither the jobs
nor the employment structure for a growing labor force. The low output
growth, the excessive capital intensity of investment, the mismatch between
the job aspirations of those with post-primary education and the jobs avail-
able to them, the post-war demographic bulge, and the rising female par-
ticipation rates contributed to a massive increase in unemployment, estimated
at over 1 million, or some 18% of the labor force in 1977.
6.        In sharp contrast to this poor economic performance, Sri Lanka's
social achievements in relation to per capita income have been outstanding.
Sri Lanka has about one and one-half times the life expectancy, almost thrice
the literacy, one-quarter the infant mortality, and half the birth rate which
would be expected for a country at its per capita income level. Nutrition
levels have been adequate, and in the 1960s paralleled gains in income dis-
tribution. These improvements in the quality of life, in particular the rise
in health standards, the spread of education and the availability of sub-
sidized food have been important factors in the decline in mortality. The
increasing age of marriage, the spread of female education and employment,
and a vigorous family planning program, have also contributed to a sharp
decline in fertility. As a consequence, population growth, net of migration,
has dropped steadily, from 2.7% per annum in the 1953-63 period to 2.2% per
annum in the 1963-71 period, and 1.7% per annum during 1971-81.
7.        Favorable initial conditions induced these social gains.  Compul-
sory primary education was introduced as early as 1901. The food ration was
introduced in 1942. Thus, at the time of Independence in 1948, Sri Lanka
already enjoyed high levels of adult literacy and life expectancy. These
initial gains were consolidated and expanded in the post-independence
period through large expenditures on social services and the food subsidy,
expenditures which accounted for two-fifths to one-half of government
revenues in the 1960s and early 1970s. These expenditures were traditionally
financed by capturing the surpluses of the three major tree crops, which
provided the Government with easy sources of revenue and foreign exchange.
These surpluses began to decline in the late 1960s as government policies
discriminated against tree crops and export unit prices weakened. As growth
in other productive sectors also decelerated in the 1970-77 period, the
budgetary resources available for social programs were squeezed between
inelastic revenues and rapid inflation. As a consequence, expenditures for
social services other than the food subsidy began to decline as a proportion
of total current expenditures and of GDP, threatening the hard-won gains in



- 3 -
health and education. In short, the economy could no longer generate the
resources needed to sustain the large program of welfare expenditures.
Moreover, the very size of those programs reduced the scope for policy makers
to shift resources to development.
8.         The policy changes introduced in 1977, following the election of
the United National Party, were intended to break this vicious circle. The
new Government identified its objectives as the sustained revival and resus-
citation of the economy and increased employment through (i) increased
capacity utilization in the productive sectors, (ii) stimulation of savings
*            and investment, and (iii) efforts to encourage exports, and import substitu-
tion in foodgrains. A program of policy reforms was developed in close
consultation with the IMF. These reforms were supported initially by an IMF
standby arrangement covering 1978 for SDR 93 million. On January 26, 1979,
the Fund's Executive Board approved an SDR 260 million Extended Arrangement
which covered the 1979-81 period. The principal aim of the reform program
was to dismantle controls over resource allocation and initiate price adjust-
ments with a view to establishing more realistic relative prices. By 1980,
these goals had largely been achieved.
9.        The program of reforms comprised a number of major policy initia-
tives. The exchange rate was unified 1/ on November 16, 1977, at a
depreciated rate of Rs 16 = IJSS1.00 and allowed to float.  This implied a
depreciation of 46% against the official rate prevailing prior to unifica-
tion, and 11.2% with respect to the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate
(FEEC) rate. The trade and payments regime was liberalized. Public sector
import monopolies were almost entirely terminated. Prior licensing of
imports was abolished for all but a handful of commodities. The tariff
structure was revised and simplified. Other budgetary taxes and subsidies
were adjusted to reflect the change in trade and exchange rate policies. In
particular, rice and sugar rations were confined to the poorer half of the
population, and the food subsidy was eliminated through a series of adjust-
ments in administered prices. On September 1, 1979, the Government intro-
duced a system of food and kerosene stamps for families with monthly incomes
of less than Rs 300 to replace specific subsidies and food rationing, and
to target benefits to the poor. To help offset the adverse impact of these
changes on real incomes, public sector wages were periodically adjusted
upwards. Public corporations were asked to pass on cost increases, except
for fertilizer, petroleum, milk, and public transport, for which price
increases were initially deferred to cushion the impact on consumers. The
Government subsequently eliminated the overall subsidy on petroleum products
1/ Prior to unification, all exports other than tea, rubber, and coconut
products and all imports other than food, fertilizers, and drugs were
channelled through the certificate market. Since November 1972, the FEEC
rate was maintained at a 65% premium over the official rate.



- 4 -
and made sizable adjustments in bus and train fares, electricity and fer-
tilizer prices. The burden of selected subsidies and transfers, as a conse-
quence, fell from around 10% of GDP in 1977 to around 3% by 1981. These
changes, and higher aid receipts, have helped permit a sizable increase in
capital expenditures.
10.       Agricultural pricing policies have changed dramatically.  The
domestic support price for paddy was increased by 21% in November 1977, by
25% in November 1980, and by a further 15% in the course of 1981 following
substantial increases in fertilizer prices. With the related increase in
flour prices, incentives for paddy and other flour substitutes benefited.                      9
At the same time, there was a large policy-induced decline in the role of the
state in domestic rice trade. Fresh coconut prices were also increased, and
in November 1981, the system of fixed and variable duties which had effec-
tively insulated the large domestic coconut market from the world market was
replaced by a sliding scale export system that allowed some linkage between
the two markets. While the unification of the exchange rate ended formal
discrimination against tree crops, high export duties, particularly on tea,
continued to siphon off most of the operating surplus for the Government.
As tea prices fell and production costs rose in 1978-79, the Government
responded to the reduced producer margins by lowering taxes on tea exports.
The Government also ended most price controls, and reformed the interest rate
and tax systems. The burden of company and personal taxation was lowered,
and the taxation system was rationalized to increase revenue elasticity;
nevertheless, the overall revenue elasticity to economic growth and domestic
inflation remains low as taxes on slowly growing tree crop exports still
average over 30% of current revenues. Interest rates were also raised
sharply to encourage savings and discourage speculative imports. However,
inflation eroded these rates and in April 1980 further upward adjustments
were made.
11.       These economic reforms were accompanied by a major effort to step
up public investment. The Government-s capital expenditures jumped from 6%
of GDP in 1977 to an average of 13% in 1978 and 1979, and 19% in 1980, as
government departments responded to the initial improvement in the budgetary
resource position and embarked on long overdue replacement investments and
new projects that had been shelved earlier for lack of resources. At the
same time, the Government undertook three major new programs which are to be
the lead projects in a five-year rolling public investment program.  These
are: (i) accelerated implementation of the Mahaweli Ganga Development
Program, by far the largest multipurpose river basin development program ever
undertaken in Sri Lanka; (ii) a 200 square mile free trade zone north of
Colombo under a newly constituted Greater Colombo Economic Commission which
has established the first of several Investment Promotions Zones near
Colombo-s international airport and by end-1981 had signed agreements with 68
investors involving a total investment of US$100 million; and (iii) a massive
housing and urban renewal program with its main focus on the Colombo
metropolitan region, including the construction of a new capital complex at



- 5 -
Kotte, a suburb of Colombo. Budgetary expenditures on these three programs
will amount to Rs 34 billion, or 34% of projected budgetary resources over
the 1982-86 period. The underlying public investment strategy seeks to
balance the large investment requirements of the Government-s high priority
programs with the urgent rehabilitation and fresh investment needs in other
sectors. The main thrust of the public sector program is to lay the founda-
tion for longer-term development, both by encouraging efficient use of exist-
ing infrastructure investments and by expanding the longer-term private
sector to respond to the economic reforms and the stimulus of the public
sector investment program, and provide much of the short-term growth.
Private fixed investment responded well, increasing from about 7% of GDP in
1977 to 12% by 1980, and helping overall fixed investment to exceed 31% of
GDP in 1980.
12.       In response to the policy reforms and the accompanying acceleration
in investment, economic growth in 1978-81 averaged an impressive 6.5% per
annum. This growth was shared by almost all sectors of the economy, par-
ticularly construction and services. The only major exception has been the
tree crop sector. The otherwise impressive performance is due to a number of
factors including the improved availability of inputs following import
liberalization, an increased role for the private sector in distribution, and
the removal of price controls. Although there is little information avail-
able on employment, Central Bank estimates suggest that unemployment dropped
from 18% of the labor force to 15% between 1977 and 1979.
13.       Despite this strong performance, major weaknesses in economic
performance had emerged by 1980. In particular, the national savings effort
had not matched the rapid rise in investment. Gross national savings fluc-
tuated around 15% of GDP during the 1978-80 period, while recourse to foreign
savings to finance the higher investment rose from 4.5% of GDP in 1978 to
20.0% in 1980. Although the Government has succeeded in containing the
costly consumer subsidy and transfer programs, expenditures on which have
declined as a percent of GDP (para 9), relatively inelastic revenues combined
with steadily rising other recurrent expenditures and declining terms of
trade resulted in hardly any public savings over the 1978-80 period. As a
result, the Government has financed its rapidly rising capital expenditures
through foreign aid, and increased domestic borrowings. Initially the
Government met its domestic financing requirements through non-expansionary
borrowings from captive financial institutions, which could mobilize
increased private savings following the interest rate reform. However,
resources raised through these channels have not grown as rapidly as the
budgetary deficit, and the Government was increasingly forced to undertake
expansionary borrowings from the Central Bank. Between 1978 and 1979, these
rose from 0.4% to 1.2% of GDP and in 1980 increased sharply to 10.5% of GDP.
It has also resorted to the use of foreign commercial loans to help finance
the deficit, borrowing US$50 million in 1980, and US$75 million in 1981.



-6 -
14.       Inflation has also increased sharply since 1977.  The exchange rate
adjustment, the other policy-induced price increases and related wage
increases, the removal of price controls, and the build-up of external
assets, which added to the money supply, contributed significantly to infla-
tionary pressures in 1978 and 1979. However, these were moderated by bumper
paddy harvests, increased capacity utilization in the economy, increased
availability of imports, and the beneficial effects of competition from
imports and in domestic distribution.  Since then, rapid growth in the broad
money supply--38% in 1979 and 32% in 1980-- added a sizable "built-in"
increase to the system. Together with the corrective price increases
designed to reduce budgetary subsidies and keep pace with rapid increases in
international petroleum, wheat and sugar prices, these pressures caused
inflation (as measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index) to accelerate
from an average of 11% in 1978 and 1979, to 26% in 1980.
15.       Rapid expansion in economic activity has been reflected most
vividly in the balance of payments. Import volume growth since 1978 has
averaged 15%. Between 1978 and 1980, the net petroleum import bill more than
tripled and increased from 11% to 36% of non-petroleum exports, while capital
goods imports more than doubled in response to the acceleration in invest-
ment. However, exports have shown barely any volume growth as declining tree
crop export volumes offset the strong growth in garments exports. These
adverse trade volume trends were compounded by an 18% terms of trade
deterioration over the same period. The rapid growth in tourism receipts and
private remittances from abroad in this period failed to offset the
deterioration on the trade account and the current account deficit rose from
$124 million (4.5% of GDP) to $805 million in 1980 (20.0% of GDP). In 1978
and 1979, rapidly rising non-monetary capital inflows due mainly to increased
net aid disbursements more than offset the current account deficit, and Sri
Lanka continued to add to its net international reserves, albeit at a declin-
ing rate. In 1980, however, net international reserves fell by $220 million,
and by end-1980 gross international reserves stood at $377 million, or equiv-
alent to less than nine weeks of imports of goods and non-factor services.
With the rapid drawdown in reserves, the public sector has begun to make
significant use of commercial financing.
16.       The Government, realizing in early 1981 that continuation of the
1980 trends would risk continued high inflation and unsustainable pressures
on the balance of payments, took corrective steps. Budgetary expenditures
were held below their 1980 level in nominal terms, implying significant cuts.
Capital expenditures declined significantly from 19% of GDP in 1980, to about
14% of GDP, and were held to below their 1980 level in nominal terms. As a
result, the overall deficit declined from 23% to 16% of GDP; bank borrowings,
from 10.7% to 4.5% of GDP. Similar improvement was achieved in the balance
of payments, where the current account deficit declined from 20% to 15% of
GDP, and net international reserves declined by only an additional $33 mil-
lion over 1980. Due mainly to large disbursements under the IMF Extended



- 7 -
Arrangement and Compensatory Financing Facility, Sri Lanka's gross interna-
tional reserves increased to $451 million, equivalent to about 11 weeks'
imports coverage. The stabilization measures also resulted in a significant
decline in inflation--the Colombo Consumer Price Index averaged 18% growth
during 1981, compared to 26% in 1980. Despite the significant achievements
in 1981, continued strong measures will be needed throughout the medium term
to ensure that budgetary expenditures are consistent with overall economic
stability, as many of the large development schemes the Government has
initiated are only now beginning to peak. Sri Lanka will also have to care-
fully monitor balance of payments developments, commercial borrowings in
particular, and accelerate exports growth to ensure longer-run stability in
the external sector.
17.       Aid donors have responded enthusiastically to the Government's
development initiatives, the average level of aid commitments in 1978-80 was
almost 120% higher in nominal terms and almost 40% higher in real terms than
in 1975-77. Commitments in 1981 rose to a record US$815 million. Most of
the growth has come in project aid, reflecting the Government's efforts to
increase investment, particularly in the Accelerated Mahaweli Program. Since
public investment is now overprogrammed, continued high levels of aid will
depend upon donors' abilities to shift from project to non-project aid to
finance a sizable portion of local costs and provide supplementary financing
for ongoing projects where needed. The Government will need to maintain
donor confidence in its economic policies and management through a vigorous
domestic resource mobilization program and continued restraint on government
expenditures. Despite recent measures to support its investment program, Sri
Lanka's budgetary situation remains tight. The adverse impact on revenues of
slowly rising export prices and volumes, and rapidly rising import prices,
has increased budgetary pressures. Local cost financing, in support of Sri
Lanka's own resource mobilization efforts will not only provide valuable
relief to these budgetary pressures but also supplement foreign exchange
resources needed in support of balance of payments.
18.       External public debt outstanding and disbursed stood at US$1,585
million at the end of 1980, amounting to about 37% of GDP. However, this
is mostly long-term concessional debt. As a result, the debt service burden
is relatively low; debt service ratio in 1981 excluding IMF repurchases stood
at 8.7% of exports of goods and non-factor services, declining from 16.7% in
1976. While this sustained decline is due in part to improved export earn-
ings, the main cause has been a decline in outstanding short- and medium-term
commercial borrowings. Recent resort to commercial finance means that the
debt service ratio will begin to rise again. This should not pose economic
problems if early steps are taken to further reduce the ratio of the current
account deficit to GDP. If this does not happen, Sri Lanka will again have
to begin undertaking significant shorter maturity commercial borrowings to
fill the gap between the current account deficit and likely concessional aid
flows. In that case, the debt service ratio could increase quickly.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SRI LANKA
19.     Since the beginning of its operations in Sri Lanka in 1954, the Bank
Group has approved eight loans totalling US$72.9 million (net of cancella-
tions) and 31 credits totalling US$595 million 1/ (net of cancellations) in
support of 37 projects. About 47% of Bank Group assistance has been for
agriculture (irrigation, agricultural, and dairy development), 18% for power,
11% for transport, and the remainder for development finance company opera-
tions, a program credit (mainly involving the import of raw materials for
industry), water supply, constrution industry, telecommunications and small
and medium industries. Eight loans and eight credits have been fully dis-
bursed so far. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group opera-
tions as of March 31, 1982, together with notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
20.     IFC has an equity investment of about US$150,000 equivalent in the
Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC). Two IFC lines of credit
totalling US$7.0 million have been made to the Government-owned Bank of
Ceylon (BOC) for term loans to medium industries. IFC has also an investment
of US$260,000 in an equipment leasing company. In FY81, IFC approved an
investment of about US$0.7 million in equity and about US$17.0 million in
loans for a new hotel project in Colombo.
21.     The Bank Group's current strategy focusses on the agricultural sec-
tor. It aims to support Government efforts to increase food production and
reduce dependence on food imports, and to raise productivity, employment,
incomes and living standards of the rural population in Sri Lanka. This
strategy includes projects to support basic infrastructure. In addition to
providing financing for the Second and Third Mahaweli Ganga Development
Projects and the Mahaweli Ganga Technical Assistance Project, the Bank Group
is assisting GOSL to implement the Accelerated Mahaweli Ganga Development
Program (Accelerated Mahaweli Program) principally through coordinating
external assistance. The Board approved a Tea Rehabilitation and Diver-
sification Project on May 4, 1982. Currently under appraisal are a forestry
project, an industrial development project and a rural development project.
22.     The Bank Group, as of end 1981, accounted for 9.7% (IBRD, 1.8%; IDA,
7.9%) of Sri Lanka's total debt outstanding and disbursed, and 6.3% (over 80%
IBRD) of debt service on official medium and long-term debt. The projected
Bank Group's share in total existing external debt outstanding and disbursed
will increase to 17% by 1985 (with the IBRD's share declining to 1.3%).  The
1/ As of March 31, 1982.

Bank and IDA portions of this debt service are expected to decline to about
4% by 1985.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Power Source and Potential
23.     Sri Lanka-s energy consumption in 1980 amounted to 3.7 million tonne
of oil equivalent (toe), of which 60% was provided by firewood, 27% by
imported oil and 13% by hydropower. The rate of consumption of firewood is
estimated to be between 3.8 and 5.4 million tons (1.5-2.2 million toe) per
year. Although the per capita use of wood has increased very little over the
past fifteen years, the absolute increase rose to a degree that there is now
concern about deforestation. There are no known reserves of coal, oil or
natural gas. Exploration off the northwest shore is in progress, but the
likelihood of substantial finds is small. The sole importer and refiner of
petroleum and its products is Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). Its
refinery has a capacity of 2.35 million tons per year and produces enough
gasoline for the country, but part of the needs for diesel and kerosene is
imported. More heavy furnace oil is produced than the domestic market needs,
the surplus being exported as bunker fuel. Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG),
though not important at present, is in excess supply, and as it is relatively
cheap, its use is likely to increase.
24.     The total potential for hydro energy in the country is estimated at
6,6no GWh per year. The firm energy available from existing hydro develop-
ments is about 1,500 GWh per year, and the additions now planned will
increase it to about 3,240 GWh by 1990. A ranking study of all remainina
hydro sites is planned.
Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)
25.     CEB is a public corporation, established in 1969 to replace the
Department of Government Electrical Undertakings. It is governed by a seven
member Board appointed by GOSL. GOSL controls tariffs, capital investment,
borrowing, the appointment of the Chairman and the General Manager, and the
conditions of service of all employees. CEB is subject to the provisions of
the 1971 Finance Act regulating the finances of public corporations. CEB has
adequate organization and management systems designed by international con-
sultants in 1973 under the Fourth Power Project (Loan 636-CE for US$21.0
million) of 1969. However, its managerial effectiveness, in recent years,
has declined. A program of measures for improvement of management and train-
ing is currently in place (paras 52 and 53).



- 10 -
Generation and Transmission
26.     CEB is responsible for the transmission and distribution of elec-
tricity in the country and for the development of its own generating capacity
with the exception of the Ukuwela station constructed under the Mahaweli
Ganga Development Program. CEB's recent generation program includes two
hydro stations of 40 MW at Bowatenne (commissioned last year) and of 60 MW at
Canyon (scheduled for commissioning later this year). In all CEB has 559 MW
of installed generating capacity, of which 369 MW is in eight hydro plants
and the balance in steam turbine, gas turbine and diesel stations.  The main
transmission system, extending over 569 miles, operates at 132 kV but there
is also an older 66 kV system (214 miles). The first elements of a 220 kV
grid are to be constructed in 1983/84, part under the Victoria Project (IJ.K.
assisted) and part under the Seventh Power Project (Credit 1210-CE). Sub-
transmission and distribution lines at 33 kV extend to about 3,250 miles, and
there are about 750 miles of 11 kV overhead distribution lines, whereas in
the city of Colombo the distribution is mainly by underground cables.
27.     The Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL), which is an agency under
the Ministry of Mahaweli Development for implementing a multi-purpose program
for construction of dams, hydro stations and irrigation works, is responsible
for the construction works at Victoria (210 MW), Kotmale (134 MW), and Ran-
denigala (122 MW). As each hydro component under this program is completed,
it will be transferred to CEB for operation. The Victoria and Kotmale hydro
stations, now under construction, are scheduled to come on line in 1984 and
1985 respectively. Construction works on Randenigala project is scheduled to
start this year. Recently, satisfactory terms for the transfer of hydro
stations at Victoria and Kotmale were agreed between MASL and CEB. There are
a number of privately owned generating plants but, except for one at the CPC
refinery, these are mainly for standby purposes. A large captive generating
plant is planned for the expanded cement factory at Chunnakam. Some local
authorities in remote areas provide part time electricity service from diesel
generators.
Electricity Consumption
28.     The consumption of electrical energy increased at an average annual
rate of 9.5% from 1961 to 1980, varying from 17.8% in 1966 to 3.3% in 1974.
Growth was weak from 1972 to 1977, but with the acceleration of economic
activity it averaged 11.5% per annum during 1977-80 despite the severe load
shedding.  CEB forecasts that annual growth will continue at about 15% in the
immediate future with some tapering off to about 9% after 1985.
29.     In 1980, CEB was supplying electricity directly to about 208,000
consumers. In addition, CEB sells in bulk to 218 local authorities who
retail to about 226,000 consumers, making a total of about 434,000. Elec-
tricity consumption in 1980 was less than 100 kWh per capita. The total



- 11 -
energy generated by CEB's power stations in 1980 was 1,668 GWh, against the
estimated requirement of 1,728 GWh. Load shedding took place during 1980
(May-August) and 1981 (February-June) due to lower than average rainfall, and
the breakdown of a hydro unit.
Rural Electrification
30.     Rural electrification, at present, is available to about 2,000 of Sri
Lanka's 25,000 villages. Under a rural electrification project financed by
the Asian Development Bank (ADB), CEB has planned to provide connections to
additional 1,150 villages by 1984 and to arrange financing of house wiring
and connection charges by installment payments. A load promotion and
monitoring unit will also be introduced in CEB under this project.
Development Program
31.     CEB's generation program through 1990 calls for the addition of about
600 MW of hydro generating capacity. About 500 MW of this total would be
contributed by the Accelerated Mahaweli Program alone. In order to prevent
capacity and energy shortages before enough new hydro stations - Canyon,
Victoria and Kotmale - are commissioned, CEB installed 120 MW of gas turbines
in two phases during 1980 and 1981. CEB undertook a study in early 1981 to
determine the least cost solution for meeting imminent energy shortages by
mid 1984 and beyond. GOSL and CEB decided to install an 80 MW diesel plant
on the basis of this study.
32.     CEB is also preparing a 15-year master plan for power generation,
transmission and distribution on a least cost basis. CEB will submit this
plan, endorsed by GOSL, to the Bank by December 31, 1982, and thereafter
update it annually by December 31 of each subsequent year (Section 4.06,
draft Loan Agreement (LA) and Section 3.03(b) draft Guarantee Agreement
(GA)).
33.     Studies of the transmission system by CEB's engineers in 1979 indi-
cated that a voltage higher than 132 kV would be necessary to handle the
flows of power to be expected from Mahaweli developments in the mid-1980s.
This finding was confirmed by consultants who recommended the use of 220 kV
lines from the Victoria-Kotmale-Randenigala/Rantembe areas to the load cen-
ters of Colombo. Future expansion of the grid will proceed on that basis
(para 26).
Sector Coordination
34.     Recognizing CEB's role in the overall development of the power sec-
tor, IDA under the previous credits has emphasized the need for adequate
coordination between CEB and other agencies, particularly MASL, involved in



- 12 -
the preparation, design and construction of any "joint scheme". 1/ The level
of coordination between CEB and MASL presently is limited to technical mat-
ters. As agreed under the Seventh Power Project (Credit 1210-CE), the
Government would ensure proper coordination between CEB, MASL and other
relevant agencies (Section 3.02(a), draft (GA)).
The Bank Group's Role and External Assistance
35.     Between 1954 and 1969, the Bank made four loans totalling US$58.4
million for power development in Sri Lanka. The first three were made to
GOSL and the fourth (1969) to the newly established CEB. In 1969 the Bank
and IDA extended US$29.0 million (Loan 653-CE/Credit 174-CE) for a
multi-purpose development on the Mahaweli, which included the construction of
the Ukuwela hydro (38 MW) station now operated by CEB. These loans and the
credit helped establish a total generating capacity of 203 MW, of which, 153
MW was hydro and 50 MW thermal. The Bank Group-s involvement in the improve-
ment of transmission and distribution systems started with the Fifth Power
Project (Credit 372-CE) for an IDA credit of US$6.0 million in 1973, followed
by the Sixth Power project (Credit 1048-CE) for US$19.5 million for further
reinforcement and improvement of existing transmission and distribution
systems in 1980. Another credit of US$36.0 million (Credit 1210-CE) was
approved recently primarily to establish 220 kV transmission lines for the
first time in the country.
36.     Physical implementation of previous projects has been satisfactory.
Recent Project Performance Audit Reports for the Fourth (1969) and the Fifth
(1973) Power Projects and the Mahaweli Multipurpose Project (1969) expressed
satisfaction about the implementation and initial operation of these
projects. An organizational structure and appropriate public utility manage-
ment and financial systems were developed by consultants financed under the
Fourth Power Project. Staffing difficulties in recent years and the lack of
adequate management training for senior management have prevented the full
utilization of CEBEs systems. Further strengthening of CEB's management and
training was a feature of the Sixth and Seventh Power Projects.
37.     ADB has provided financing for the Bowatenne and Canyon hydro sta-
tions, and for rural electrification (para 30). GOSL has arranged bilateral
aid for the Mahaweli hydro stations; from UK for Victoria and from the
Federal Republic of Germany for Randenigala; it is using Swedish import
support credit funds for the partial financing of the Kotmale project. A 220
kV transmission line from Randenigala-Rantembe to Victoria is being financed
under assistance from Federal Republic of Germany as part of the Randenigala
1/ "Joint Scheme" means any scheme designed for the generation of electrical
energy, irrigation of land, control of flood and the like purposes as
defined under the Ceylon Electricity Board Act No. 17, 1969.



- 13 -
project. The UK-assisted Victoria hydro project includes a 220 kV transmis-
sion link from Victoria to Kotmale.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.     The proposed project was prepared by CEB with assistance from con-
sultants and appraised in January 1982. The Staff Appraisal Report entitled
"Eighth (Diesel) Power Project" (No. 39816-CE, dated May 20, 1982) is being
distributed separately. Negotiations were held in Washington from May 11 to
14, 1982. GOSL and CEB were represented by a delegation led by Professor
K.K.Y.W. Perera, Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy and Chairman,
CEB. A timetable of key events relating to the project and special condi-
tions of the proposed loan are given in Annex III.
Objective
39.     The near term objective of the project is to meet shortages of elec-
tricity expected to emerge in the first half of 1984 by establishing an 80 MW
diesel station. It will also provide thermal generation which wili 'e
required for CEB system through 1990 even if the hydro stations at V-ztcria,
Kotmale and Randenigala under the Accelerated Mahaweli Program are commis-
sioned as scheduled. The type of plant to be furnished under the project will
remain economically viable throughout its normal life span.
Project Description
40.     The project consists of an 80 MW power station, complete in every
detail, the prime movers of which are diesel engines capable of burning
residual fuel oil. The supply of such fuel would be available from the
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation on a long term contract. The fuel cost is
estimated at Rs 0.68 per kWh, compared to Rs 1.40 for a combined plant of gas
turbine and diesel generators, and Rs 2.10 for gas turbine plant only. The
station will be located adjacent to the refinery at Sapugaskanda in the
outskirts of Colombo.
Engineering and Implementation
41.     The project will be implemented by means of a single responsibility
contract. The contractor will supply, erect and construct the entire power
station. Components of the station include civil works, engines and gener-
ators with auxiliaries, electrical plant, building services, spares, and
staff training at manufacturers' works. The short transmission link needed
from the project site to the existing Sapugaskanda 132 kV grid substation is
not included in the project, but will be constructed by CEB's own forces and



- 14 -
financed under the Seventh Power (Mlahaweli Transmission) Project. Specifica-
tions and tender documents were prepared by CEB and engineering consultants
who will be responsible also for supervision of construction. The cost of
engineering consultancy services is estimated at about US$1.5 million, based
on 200 man-months of foreign engineering services at an average cost of
US$7,500 per man-month to cover fees, subsistence, allowances, international
travel and reimbursable foreign costs.
Project Cost and Financing
42.     The total project cost is estimated at about US$54.7 million equiv-
alent (including customks duties of about US$3.3 million equivalent) with a
foreign exchange component of US$42.7 million inclusive of a front end fee of
about US$0.7 million. The station would be supplied and constructed under
a single responsibility fixed price contract (bids already opened (para 44)),
hence, the provision of price contingency has not been made. Physical con-
tingency of 5% on foreign costs and 10% on local costs is included. The
estimate also covers the cost of technical services including the consulting
engineers' services. The proposed Loan of US$42.7 million would finance the
full foreign exchange cost. The local costs amounting to US$12.0 million
equivalent would be funded from CEB's internal cash generation.
43.     The proposed Loan would be made to CEB on the standard IBRD interest
rate of 11.6% per annum for a period of 20 years, including 2 years of grace,
with the guarantee of GOSL. GOSL in turn would charge CEB a guarantee fee of
1/ per annum (Section 3.05, draft GA). Since CEB cannot undertake foreign
exchange risk under the Ceylon Electricity Board Act of 1969, GOSL would bear
the foreign exchange risk.
Procurement and Disbursements
44.     The only way in which the station can be completed by early 1984 is
by letting a single contract for the supply, construction, commissioning and
testing of the entire works, to a contractor experienced in projects of this
type. This contract will be procured through international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Tenders were opened on
April 8, 1982 and thie contract is expected to be awarded by July 1982. The
Loan will be disbursed against 100% of the foreign expenditures under the
power station contract and 100% of foreign expenditures on technical services
including services of the engineering consultants. Retroactive financing of
up to US$4.2 million is recommended for expenditures incurred after April 1,
1982.
Tariffs and Finances
45.     Tariffs:  CEB has satisfactorily revalued its fixed assets up to
1980, in accordance with an index-linked formula agreed with the Bank. As
the Government did not authorize tariff increases, CEB was unable to achieve



- 15 -
the 8% rate of return on currently valued net fixed assets in operation from
1974 to 1978 as required under the Fifth Power project (1973). The present
Government which came in power in late 1977, authorised first two tariff
increases between 1978 and 1980. As a result of these increases, CEB's
average tariff rose frorm Rs 0.16/kWh to 0.58/kWh excluding fuel surcharge.
Its financial rate of return on revalued assets, having declined from 7% in
1974 to 2% in 1978, increased to about 9% in 1980. Since October 1980, CEB
is also recovering automatically each month from its consumers the cost of
fuel for its increasing thermal generation. With the addition of fuel sur-
charge, the average tariff was equivalent to about US6 cents per kWh in 1981.
However, over 90% of domestic consumers, whose monthly consumption was below
200 kWh (equivalent to a maximum charge of UJS$5), were exempt from the fuel
surcharge until end of Mtay 1982.
46.      CEB will continue to review its tariffs annually before the start
of eachi financial year to ensure that revenues are sufficient to meet operat-
ing expenses, including taxes, if any, and to produce a rate of return of
at least 8% on currently valued net fixed assets in operation (Section
5.05(a), draft LA). Tariffs were reviewed by CEB in recent months to meet
one of the conditions of effectiveness of Credit 1210-CE. As a result,
tariff increase package involving an average tariff increase of 36% has been
approved by GOSL effective June 1, 1982. The average tariff including fuel
surchiarge now amounts to the equivalent of about US9 cents per kWh. The
exermption of first 200 units of domestic consumption fronm the fuel surcharge
has also been reduced to 150 units from June 1, 1982.
47.      Tariff Structure:  In addition to increases in tariff levels, which
have enabled CEB to meet its financial rate of return commitment, CEB has
made some improvements to its tariff structure. Domestic consumers now pay
higher block tariffs and non-domestic tariffs have been rationalized. The
study of long-run marginal cost (LEIIC) pricing has been completed and the
results reviewed by the Bark.  Major structural improvements along LR11C lines
were submitted to GOSL as part of the tariff increase package (para 46). The
average tariff effective June 1, 1982 is about two-thirds LRMC as against 45%
previously.
48.      Present Financial Position.  CEB's financial position at end 1981
indicates a satisfactory debt/equity ratio of 18:82 with debt service covered
6.4 times by earnings. The financial rate of return on revalued assets is
estimated at about 11%. The current ratio is estimated at 2.7. CEB would
reduce inventories which, at end 1979, were found to be equivalent to 18
months' need, to a level satisfactory to the Bank (Section 5.08, draft LA).
GOSL has also agreed, as under the Seventh Power Project, to ensure the
timely availability of foreign exchange for inventories (Section 3.03(a),
draft GA). Based on a review of materials management problems by CEB's
consultants, action is being taken to improve inventory control.



- 16 -
49.     Future Finances:  CEB-s presently approved investment program for
FY82-FY85 comprises mainly hydro generation and rural electrifiation
(ADB-assisted), and transmission and distribution (IDA-assisted). The
program includes the proposed addition of an 80 MW diesel plant. Total
financing required for the program is estimated at about US$317 million
equivalent. About 34% of this total is projected to be met by CEB through
its internal resources to be generated by the recent tariff increase (para
46) together with the return, as already agreed by GOSL, of income tax pay-
able by CEB in FYs 1982 and 1983 following recent changes in tax legislation.
CEB's long term finances through 1988 are satisfactory, with debt/equity
ratio increasing to 45/55 in 1988 following the transfer of assets under the
Accelerated Mahaweli Program and the current ratio falling to about 2.0. As
under Seventh Power Project, debt service coverage of at least 1.25 times
will be assured (Section 5.04, draft LA).
50.     Billing and Collection:  In recent years CEB's billing and collection
performance has been satisfactory except for the collection from the local
authorities. CEB is required, under the Seventh Power Project, to ensure
that consumer receivables do not exceed the equivalent of three months bill-
ings. CEB's present obligation will continue under the proposed Loan (Sec-
tion 5.06, draft LA). At December 31, 1981, the consumer receivables
amounted to 4.1 months of billings against 3.2 months at end 1980. CEB
expects this deterioration to be temporary: it is largely attributable to
problems connected with the present computer arrangements for billing, which
CEB-s consultants are presently reviewing and to delayed payments by local
authorities. In view of the difficult financial situation of the local
authorities, GOSL undertook to cover the difference between the effective
tariff charged by the CEB and the lower rate paid by the local authorities
since December 1978. The obligation of GOSL in this respect has now been
paid in full to CEB, and a decision has been made for the local authorities
to pay full CEB tariffs as of October 1, 1981. GOSL would also ensure that
each of the local authorities would pay the current CEB tariff and also
introduce retail tariffs sufficient to cover CEB's bills for bulk supply and
their own costs of distribution as well (Section 3.04, draft GA).
Institutional Development
51.     Staff:  Currently, CEB-s employees total about 11,000 against an
authorized strength of about 14,000. Over the period 1975 to 1980, the
number of employees increased at an average annual rate of about 5%, which is
reasonable considering CEB's expanding work program and particularly the
rural electrification program undertaken by force account. In common with
other public corporations in Sri Lanka, CEB has considerable difficulty in
retaining experienced staff in recent years as many engineers and accountants
have left for overseas or for the private sector which offer substantially
higher salaries. Nevertheless, CEB has recently filled a number of key
financial posts.



- 17 -
52.     Training:  CEB's present training facilities are inadequate in rela-
tion to the training needs. Managerial training for engineers, on-the-job
training for newly recruited engineers, and training for accounting staff in
CEB's financial operations are some of the critical areas requiring atten-
tion. These would be covered by the training program financed under the
Sixth and Seventh Power projects.
53.     Management Systems:  Comprehensive reporting, accounting and budget-
ing systems were introduced by CEB in 1973 based on recommendations of con-
sultants financed under the Fourth Power Project (1969). The systems are
satisfactory, but in recent years, financial and management information
reports have not been produced on a regular and timely basis. This has
reduced management effectiveness and control. CEB agreed under the Sixth
Power Project (1980) to implement a program of management improvements.
Accordingly, the management consultants who designed the original systems
were recalled to review the position. They have recently begun a program of
measures to restore managerial effectiveness which covers (a) general manage-
ment advice, (b) restoration and further development of CEB's system, and (c)
a training program. CEB, therefore, has decided to retain the management
consultants further to implement their recommendations. Funding for this
assignment has been provided under the Sixth Power project.
54.     Reorganization:  CEB's present organization originally designed by
the consultants under the Fourth Power Project is basically unchanged except
for a few modifications made in recent years. Changes now being contemplated
as part of the management improvement aim at further decentralization of
CEB's operations while retaining key controls at headquarters in Colombo. As
agreed under the Seventh Power Project, CEB will submit to the Bank, prior to
implementation, any proposal for major organizational change (Section 4.03,
draft LA).
55.     System Improvement:  Maintenance of CEB's generating stations was
satisfactory in the past, but has deteriorated in recent years; maintenance
schedules are not kept up to date for each station to permit management to
ensure satisfactory servicing. Distribution systems have had too many con-
sumers added to them without corresponding reinforcement, and have not been
well maintained. Before 1976, energy losses on CEB's system were recorded at
less than 12%, but in 1977 they started to increase and are now estimated at
about 16%. As a part of agreed plans to improve CEB's management (para 53),
CEB will investigate system losses and undertake a study of load management
and conservation.
Benefits and Risks
56.     Studies undertaken by CEB with assistance from Bank staff indicate
that the proposed project, comprising 80 MW of diesel generators, offers the
least-cost solution for CEB both in the short-term and in the longer term.
Without the project the country would suffer substantial power and energy



- 18 -
deficits from 1984. The economic rate of return on the project, with
benefits valued at the recently approved tariff level (para 46) is about 14%.
57.    While every measure is being taken to ensure timely completion (para
41), the major risk faced by the project is one of delay in commissioning,
thereby not meeting the demand for electricity from the end of 1983. A
single responsibility contract with supervision by consultants is considered
to be the best way of minimising the risk.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUIENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.     The draft Loan Agreement between the Ceylon Electricity Board and the
Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Democratic Socialist Republic
of Sri Lanka and the Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately. Special conditions of the
loan are listed in Section III of Annex III.

C. STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF MARCH 31, 1982 I/
Cr. No. 504 - Dairy Development Project; US$9.0 million of August 9, 1974;
Effective Date: February 10, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
Project focus has been shifted from the provision of credit for
cattle purchase and on-farm development to the establishment of Dairy
Producer Associations along the lines of the successful Anand pattern in
India. The Closing Date was extended by one year to permit Credit proceeds
to be used to finance the feasibility study for a proposed milk processing
plant near Kandy. The extension was also intended to provide IDA with the

progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balance evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

opportunity to continue its dialogue with the Government on the milk price/
subsidy issue. The consultant's report recommended a plant costing about
US$16.0 million, which the Government considers too large. In view of this,
the overall poor performance of the project, and lack of progress on milk
price/subsidy issue, it has been decided not to extend the present closing
date. However, the books are being kept open till June 1982 to allow
disbursement against committed expenditures.
Cr. No. 666 - Tank Irrigation Modernization Project; US$5.0 million of
January 12, 1977; Effective Date: April 12, 1977; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
Given the local budget constraints, good progress was made in
project implementation during 1981.  Staff positions and equipment provided
are sufficient to complete the project by end 1983, excluding some drainage
works and farm roads which have been deleted by the Government for budgetary
reasons. The water management program introduced in one tank area during
Maha 1980/81 went very well, but its envisaged extension to all five tanks
has not yet taken place. Severe drought in Anuradhapura district during
Maha 1981/82 caused a total failure of the paddy crop at the Mahakandarawa
Tank, where the water management program had been initiated the year before,
and a partial failure was experienced at Pavatkulam.
Cr. No. 701 - Mahaweli Ganga Development II Project; USS19.0 million of
June 21, 1Y/7; Eftective Date: December 29, 1977; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
With the exception of irrigation system infrastructure in one block
of the command area (about 1200 ac) and various buildings (about 580) throughout
System H, the construction of irrigation and social infrastructure in the
project area is essentially completed. Work remaining to be done is scheduled
for completion by early 1983. IDA has recommended that a massive and concerted
effort be made to make the irrigation system responsive and operational. The
Government agreed to establish a special construction unit to undertake the
needed modification and completion work, staffed by experienced and capable
technical staff.
Cr. No. 709 - Water Supply Project; US$9.2 million of June 30, 1977;
Effective Date: February 8, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983
The Project has made good progress in completing the procurement of
equipment and materials and in advancing the construction of civil works.
The IDA Credit and the IDA-administered CIDA Credit are almost entirely
disbursed. Financial Management of the National Water Supply and Drainage
Board (WDB) has improved with WDB now producing the financial information

required for management. WDB's progress in implementing consumer metering
is now satisfactory as a result of steps taken to accelerate the program;
WDB is now experiencing the difficulties normally expected to accompany the
introduction of consumer billing and collection; measures are being taken
to alleviate the difficulties.
Cr. No. 742 - Fourth Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon Project;
US$8.0 million of September 30, 1977; Effective Date:
December 16, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
DFCC's management problems have improved under the new General
Manager, although problems at the Board of Directors level still persist.
DFCC's capitalization and hence its exposure limits are to be expanded by
means of an increase in its issued share capital from Rs 24 million to Rs 60
million. Credit 742-CE has been fully committed and all disbursements are
expected to be completed by May 1982.
Cr. No. 818 - Tree Crop Rehabilitation (Tea) Project; U$21.0 million of
July 12, 1978; Effective Date: December 28, 1978; Closing
Date: December 31, 184
Project progress is close to target for field work and the standard
of field operations is high. New factory equipment is improving tea quality
and reducing cost of production. Housing has fallen behind schedule because
of escalating costs but the introduction of new designs and materials has
increased building momentum. The smallholder component has lagged behind
estate development because of weak smallholder extension; this position is
slowly improving.
Cr. No. 819 - Tree Crop Diversification (Tea) Project; US$4.5 million of
July 12, 1978; Effective Date: December 15, 1978; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
Project activities have been seriously affected by political and
social opposition to the breakup of mid-country estates into settlements.
Despite impressive activity in diversification and housing construction the
project has only been able to allocate a small number of settlements.
Continued unanticipated responsibility for tea lands and for settlement
maintenance has drained project finances. The Credit is more than 90%
disbursed. Government has handed back to Land Reform Commission some
project areas including project financed houses and diversified crops. IDA
is undertaking a detailed review of the project.

Cr. No. 891 - Kurunegala Rural Development Project; US$20.0 million of
April 26, 1979; Effective Date: August 27, 1979; Closing
Date: June 30, 1984
The project is generally on schedule; rural electrification works
have already been completed; and rural roads, health, livestock and
education works should be completed by June/July 1982. Problems on quality
of construction of irrigation and education works were identified at early
stage of project implementation. Supervisory consultants, appointed for
the Second Rural Development Project (Cr. No. 1079), are helping to improve
construction activities. Improvements on the institutional arrangements for
agricultural credit, water management, and agricultural extension are somewhat
slower than expected. High cost overruns were noted in nearly all project
components. Efforts are being made to cut down cost by introducing farmers'
donated labor for some of the activities.
Cr. No. 900 - Road Maintenance Project; US$16.5 million of June 22, 1979;
Effective Date: December 19, 1979; Closing Date: June 30,
1984
A general 25% reduction in budget allocations 1981, followed by a
further 10%, has meant a rescheduling of proposed expenditures for the project.
This has been possible without sacrificing principal project objectives but
at the cost of deferring major rehabilitation work until towards the end of
the project. The allocation for 1982 has been increased to the original
estimate and it is expected that the project would be completed by mid-1984,
almost nine months later than estimated at appraisal.
Cr. No. 931 - Agricultural Extension and Adaptive Research Project; US$15.5
million of July 24, 1979; Effective Date: October 4, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985
The basic infrastructure and programs for providing agricultural
extension services in line with the T&V system have been established and the
Department of Agriculture is making steady progress in implementing the
system. Effective linkages have been established between research, training
and extension activities. Revised technical assistance and overseas
training programs have been agreed with Government and are being
implemented. Civil works started during the past two years have been
completed while vehicles and equipment for current requirements have been
procured. Disbursements have been slow due to delays in recruitment, civil
works, staffing, procurement and technical assistance program.

Cr. No. 942 - Small and Medium Industries Project; US$16.0 million of
July 24, 1979; Effective Date: October 23, 1979; Closing
Date: June 30, 1984
The principal objectives of the project would be to encourage and
assist growth and productivity improvement of small and medium firms,
defined as enterprises having plant and equipment valued at less than Rs 1
million, so as to increase their contribution to efficient low cost
employment creation, export expansion, regional development and economic
growth. The subloan amount has been fully committed, and
disbursements which have accelerated during the last six months, are
expected to be completed one year ahead of schedule. Most technical and
marketing service assistance activities have been launched.
Cr. No. 979 - Mahaweli Ganga Technical Assistance Project; US$3.0 million
of April 16, 1980; Effective Date: July 7, 1980; Closing
Date: September 30, 1982
A review of the final draft report for the Transbasin Diversion
Study was held in Colombo during M4arch 1982 and the consultant was asked to
prepare cost and time estimates for completion of some additional studies.
It is expected that an extension of the credit will be required to complete
these studies.
Cr. No. 994 - Road Passenger Transport Project; US$53.0 million of
April 16, 1980; Effective Date: October 27, 1980; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
After a long delay by the beneficiary (SLCTB) in preparing bidding
documents for the procurement of the first batch of 660 bus chassis, a tender
was awarded in August 1981 and the first deliveries began in January 1982.
A second invitation to bid was issued in February 1982, and an award for 400
chassis is expected in September 1982. The SLCTB is preparing a third tender
for complete buses.
Orders for workshop machinery, critical units and spares have been
delivered but disbursements are lagging.
Cr. No. 1017 - Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation Project; US$16.0 million
of June 24, 1980; Effective Date: September 10, 1980;
Closing Date: June 30, 1986
The project continues to progress well. The replanting program in
particular is proceeding at above target levels. Distribution of fertilizer
is also taking place properly. Response by farmers to participate in
replanting under the project has been highly satisfactory.



-30-
ANNEX II
Page 7
The institution building aspects of the project have been progressing
slowly. This is not having serious repercussions on the physcial implementation
of the project. However, measures are underway to speed up the institutional
aspects of the project.
Consultants for training, processing, and replanting scheme
administration have submitted their draft reports. Construction of Training
Center is complete.
Cr. No. 1020 - Telecommunicatons Project; US$30.0 million of June 24, 1980;
Effective Date: September 10, 1980; Closing Date: June 30,
1985
The Government has already established a separate Telecommunications
Department as part of orgaizational improvements under the project. The
Goverment has also increased overseas telephone and telex rates.
Procurement is about two to three months behind schedule but otherwise
proceeding well in accordance with the revised schedule.
Cr. No. 1041 - Water Supply and Sewerage II Project; US$30.0 million of
September 24, 1980; Effective Date: February 26, 1981;
Closing Date: September 30, 1983
WDB has appointed engineering consultants to supervise the
construction of the sewerage works under the Project and the financial
consultants for completion of WDB's organization management and financial
study. The project expenditures have been rephased to reflect the reduction
in local resource allocation during 1981. Procurement of materials and
equipment, and civil works for the major component of the water supply
project are proceeding according to the new agreed schedule.
Cr. No. 1048 - Sixth Power Project; US$19.5 million of September 24, 1980;
Effective Date: March 30, 1981; Closing Date: March 31,
1985
The IDA financed components are now proceeding satisfactorily. The
average tariff for power supplied by the Ceylon Electricity Board was increased
from about Rs 0.30 to Rs 0.98/kWh on October 1, 1980. The LRMC tariff study
was recently completed and structural improvements are proposed as part of the
tariff increase scheduled prior to effectiveness of the Credit for the Seventh
Powei Project. CEB has appointed consultants for a program of "restoration"
of systems and training: a comprelhensive training program has been prepared
and implementation has started. Engineering consultants have been appointed
to design the project components to be financed by the Saudi Fund.

Cr. No. 1079 - Second Rural Development Project; US$33.5 million of
February 2, 1981; Effective Date: June 2, 1981; Closing
Date: June 30, 1986
The project is making satisfactory progress. Supervisory and
planning consultants have been appointed. Project equipment, with the
exception of a few items, have been procured and handed out to the
respective agencies. Construction programs for all components are generally
on schedule.
Cr. No. 1130 - Construction Industry Project; US$13.5 million of June 1,
1981; Effective Date: August 19, 1981; Closing Date:
June 30, 1984
Overall project progress is satisfactory and on schedule. Pilot
training programs for basic artisans in carpentry and masonry, and technical
site supervision started in August. The 'on-site' phase of these programs
have just began and are being monitored closely to determine whether the
downturn in the construction sector would seriously jeopardize this aspect of
the project. Programs in Plant Mechanics started in early October 1981, and
a Plant Operator course began in early November 1981.
Cr. No. 1160 - Village Irrigation Rehabilitation Project; US$30.0 million
of July 15, 1981; Not Yet Effective; Closing Date:
December 31, 1986
Construction activities during 1981 fell slightly below appraisal
estimates manily due to budgetary constraints. The investigation program has
also lagged slightly behind schedule although this is not expected to affect
the 1982 program significantly. The institutional changes in the Department
of Agrarian Services in support of a systematic water management program have
been made, an adviser has been recruited and training programs initiated.
Procurement of equipment has proceeded on schedule and orders for the bulk
of equipment to be supplied under the project have been placed.
Cr. No. 1166 - MIahaweli Ganga Development Project III; US$90.0 million of
November 5, 1981; Effectiveness Date: February 5, 1982;
Closing Date: December 31, 1986
The credit became effective on February 8, 1982. The Japanese OECF
loan agreement was signed on October 16, 1981, and the Kuwait Fund A.E.D.
loan agreement has been initialed in draft form and Board approval is
imminent. Construction of the Right Bank Transbasin Canal is somewhat
behind schedule but the quality of completed work is good. The contractor
requested a contract extension of seven months (from December 1981 to July

1982), but later reduced the extension request to four months and is
importing additional equipment.
Cr. No. 1182 - Second Small and Medium Industries Project; US$30.0 million
of February 5, 1982; Closing Date: December 31, 1985
The Credit is not yet effective.
