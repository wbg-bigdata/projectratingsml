MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECJTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO UGANDA
FOR A SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed development credit to Uganda
for SDR 18.9 million (US$24.9 million equivalent) is submitted for
approval. The proposed credit would be on IDA terms with 40 years maturity
and help finance a Sugar Rehabilitation Project.  The project would be
cofinanced with the African Development Bank and the African Development
Fund, who would provide loans of BUA 6.86 million (US$8.7 million
equivalent) and FUA 7.97 million (US$9.4 million equivalent), respectively.
2.       Background.  Sugar processing developed as the largest industry in
Uganda before 1972 and performed at a high level of efficiency. Political
instability caused large scale physical deterioration of plant and
equipment and loss of qualified personnel in the industry. Subsequently,
domestic production declined sharply and sugar imports rose. The industry
has a nominal capacity of 175,000 tons of sugar a year, including the
Kakira estate, but can in its current state not produce any sugar. The
main reasons for underutilization of the domestic capacity have been: (i)
inadequate maintenance of factories and estates due to political
instability and lack of operational funds; (ii) internal management
problems; (iii) lack of comprehensive and adequately financed
rehabilitation programs; and (iv) unresolved ownership of the Kakira
complex until March 1985, when the Government entered into a Joint Venture
Agreement with East Africa Holdings, Ltd. (former Uganda-Asian owners)
establishing Kakira Sugar Works Ltd. (KSW). In 1983, the Government
requested IDA assistance for rehabilitation of the Kakira complex. A
project was prepared in 1984, pre-appraised and partially appraised in
April 1985. Appraisal was completed in July 1987 following the
finalization of KSW's financial structure and agreement with the Government
on an appropriate pricing policy. During project preparation IDA has been
closely associated with Government efforts to resolve problems facing the
Kakira complex through an intensive dialogue supported by IDA-financed
studies and pre-project activities.
3.       Proiect Obiectives:  The proposed project would, over a six-year
period, rehabilitate the Kakira sugar estate and re-establish its
historical production levels, thereby saving the country significant
amounts of foreign exchange. It would also strengthen the institutional
capability of the Government for monitoring performance of the sugar
industry in Uganda, involve the adoption by the Government of an import
parity-based sugar pricing policy and provide a mechanism for liberalizing
sugar marketing and pricing.



-2-
4.         .> t     i1rtion;  The proposed project would involve (i)
reclaimirng and tp'planting a 7,900 ha estate and development of 4,100 ha of
outgrower cane production (US$12.0 million); (ii) rehabilitation of
serviceable factory equipment and replacement of remaining equipment
(US$20.0 millior); (iii) rehabilitatiort and provision of estate
infrastructure (US$7.3 million); (iv) strengthening manpower, training and
management systems in KSW (US$9.9 million); and (v) financing part of
KSW's incremental working capital requirements (US$11.0 million). The
project would strengthen the ability of the Ministry of Industry and
Technology to monitor the performance of the sugar industry and render
advice to the Government on sugar policy matters (US$0.3 million).
5.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project forms an integral part
of the Government's program for rehabilitating traditional agricultural and
agro-industrz.al enterprises. Restoration of the domestic sugar industry
has been given high priority in the Government's Economic Recovery Program.
IDA's dialogue with the Government has facilitated resolution between the
Government and its joint venture partner of issues relating to KSW's
financial structure. IDA has been instrumental in mobilizing cofinancing
for the project, including reactivating an earlier grant from the
Government of Italy. The Droposed project would complement and help bring
to fruition certain investments under the ongoing IDA-financed Agricultural
Rehabilitation and Industrial Rehabilitation projects.
6.       Key Actions Agreed On.  The policy agenda under the Government's
Economic Recovery Program, as agreed with the Bank and IMF, provides for
the gradual liberalization of sugar marketing and pricing. The Government
has agreed to import parity-based pricing during a transitional period of
administered pricing. During negotiations, agreement was obtained on a
pricing formula involving the use of h.storical moving averages of
international sugar prices which would be subject to annual reviews between
the Government and IDA. The Government has announced a sugar price for
1988 satisfactory to IDA. Arrangements for the phasing out of Government
involvement in sugar distribution were confirmed. A Sugar Industry Unit
(SIU) is being established in the Ministry of Industry to advise the
Government on policy matters concerning the sugar industry and to monitor
the industry's performance. The SIU would submit producer price proposals
to IDA each year for review. IDA would also have the opportunity to
comment on any future proposals for expanding sugar processing capacity.
7.       KSW would need to initially employ a sizeable number of
expatriates in managerial and technical positions to ensure effective
implementation of the rehabilitation program. The company has selected an
international firm to recruit qualified persons and second them to KSW for
limited periods. To allow flexibility in the number and duration of
assignments, the firm would enter into contracts with individuals selected
by KSW's Board or management from a shortlist submitted by the firm. All
contracts would be approved by RSW. To facilitate eventual replacement of
expatriates by local staff, a comprehensive training program for Ugandan
nationals is being instituted.



8.       Justification.  Uganda currently imports US$15-20 million worth of
sugar annually, which ranks second only to petroleum imports. Import
substitution through restoration of domestic production capacity is
therefore a high priority and eminently justified given the considerable
comparative advantage Uganda enjoys as a result of its landlocked
situation. Conditions for sugar production at Kakira are highly favorable.
Cane growing benefits from excellent soils, good rainfall distribution
(requiring only limited sunplementary irrigation) and relatively low levels
of inputs of fertilkzers and pesticides. The project brings back to the
Kakira complex the original owners who have a demonstrated ability to
manage sugar operations at Kakira and elsewhere.
9.       Economic benefits a-e expected from significant savings in foreign
exchange through import substitution and efficient utilization of factory
capacity. The internal economic rate of return has been estimated at 28
percent. Other benefits include the crection of employment for about 4,300
persons, the improvement of incomes for 1,400 outgrowers, and substantial
linkage effects associated with transport, marketing, distribution and
auxillary industries. Last but not least, the rehabilitation of KSW would
improve the climate for private investment in Uganda and thereby boost the
Government's efforts to rebuild the economy.
10.      Risks.  The sustainability of KSW operations would be threatened
if the company is not provided with foreign exchange for importation of
spares and inputs. The Government, as a shareholder in KSW, has agreed to
provide the necessary foreign exchange and the Association will obtain the
Gover-ment's consent to include the sugar industry among priority sectors
covered by the Open Licensing System to be established under the Economic
Reform Program. Sustainability of operations could also be threatened if
disagreements between the Government and its shareholding partner are
allowed to impede effective management, a risk which the Joint Venture
Agreement is designed to minimize.
11.      "elays in replacing expatriate staff by Ugandan nationals would
raise the foreign expendicure component of operating costs. However,
progress by KSW in implementing a comprehensive program for training of
Ugandans to assume increased responsibility would be carefully monitored
through Annual Work Programs.
12.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
