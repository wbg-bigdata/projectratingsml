REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Cr. 1893-UG)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Sugar Rehabilitation Project
in Uganda, for which Credit 1893-UG in the amount of SDR 18.9 million (US$ 24.9 million
equivalent) was approved on March 7, 1988, and became effective on October 7, 1988.
2.    The credit was closed on March 31, 1995. Final disbursement took place on November 6,
1995, at which time a balance of SDR 0.2 million was canceled. Cofinancing for the project was
provided by the African Development Bank, African Development Fund and Kakira Sugar Works
Limited (KSW). This ICR' was prepared by the staff of FAO/CP on behalf of AF2AE Division of
the Africa Region and reviewed by Ms. S. Ganguly, Division Chief, AF2AE, and Mr. G.
Sengupta, Acting Projects Advisor, AF2. The ICR is based on information obtained from the
project files and on the findings of an ICR mission which visited Uganda in July 1995. KSW
provided comments and inputs to the draft ICR. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of
the ICR by providing inputs to the Aide Memoire drafted by the FAO/CP completion mission, and
has also prepared its own assessment of the project's performance. A copy of Govemment's
Completion Report is attached.
1  The ICR was modified to reflect the inputs of vaious Bank staff who reviewed the draft report prepared by
the FAO/CP Completion Mission, and may not completely mirror the FAO/CP mission's assessment of the
project's performance, and some of the mission's findings / lessons of experience.

REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Credit 1893-UG)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1     The Sugar Rehabilitation Project was appraised in April 1987 and approved by the Board of the
Bank in March 1988. The total project cost was US$ 61.5 million towards which IDA provided a total of
US$ 32.3 million: US$ 24.9 million under the project (Cr. 1893-UG); US$3.3 million from the Industrial
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1248-UG); US$3.8 million from the Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Cr.
1328-UG); and US$0.3 million from the Second Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 1434-UG). Co-
financing for the project was provided by the African Development Bank, African Development Fund and
Kakira Sugar Works Limited (KSW), a joint venture company owned by the Government of Uganda and
East African Holdings Limited. Project funds were provided to KSW through subsidiary loan agreements
between KSW and the Government of Uganda. The Credit closing date, originally envisaged to be
December 31, 1993, was extended to March 31, 1995 in order to accommodate the final phase of
rehabilitation of the KSW factory.
2     The objectives of the project were to (i) restore sugar production of Kakira Sugar Works Limited
to historical levels and, by so doing, save Uganda's scarce foreign exchange resources that would otherwise
have been utilized to import sugar; (ii) strengthen the role of Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in
monitoring the performance of the sugar industry, coordinating industry policy and responding in general to
the industry's need for assistance during the period of rehabilitation; and (iii) support the liberalization
of sugar marketing and processing in Uganda.
3     These objectives were to be achieved through a major investment program of rehabilitation of the
agricultural production, factory and infrastructure facilities at Kakira; technical assistance for
strengthening of management and training; and, financing of incremental working capital. In addition, the
project was to establish a Sugar Industry Unit (SIU) within MTI to strengthen the monitoring and
coordination role of Government during the rehabilitation phase of the sugar industry in Uganda; and to
introduce an import parity pricing policy and mechanism for liberalizing sugar marketing. The scheduled
targets for capacity installation/rehabilitation and production were adjusted at the time of the Mid-Term
Review (MTR) in the light of implementation progress and the revised costs.
Implementation Experience and Results
4     Implementation Experience. Overall, the implementation experience has been satisfactory, but
has been characterized by slippages in the time schedule anticipated at both appraisal and mid-term review.
While this was partly caused by delays in procurements, project execution had to be adjusted in order to be
synchronous with other factors. After the factory started operations in 1989/90 at Stage I levels, factory
rehabilitation to Stage II levels had to be accommodated within an operational plan that took into account



- iii -
the availability and best use of maturing cane under the agricultural development program, the working
capital position of KSW, and the impact on the national sugar supply position that would have resulted
from extended factory shutdown. An action plan to balance these factors was designed and executed
satisfactorily.
5     Project management demonstrated a commitment to successful implementation during the project
life, and in general, dealt adequately with various implementation issues. Due to cost escalations during the
project period and under-estimation at preparation/appraisal of the scale and cost of works involved in
some components, some activities needed to be re-scaled (factory capacity from 3,000 to 2,500 tons of cane
per day, and rehabilitation of infrastructure) or dropped completely (irrigation rehabilitation) in order to
keep the costs within the levels of available financing. However, KSW financed out of its own resources,
some of the activities that were originally expected to be financed through both IDA and AfDB/F credits
(some housing rehabilitation and road improvement). These modifications were agreed to at the time of the
mid-term review.
6     Results. The objectives of the project will be fully achieved during the operational phase. During
implementation of the factory rehabilitation program, factory performance and operational efficiency
improved steadily. Throughputs increased from 735 tons of cane per day (tcd) in 90/91 to over 2,000 tcd
in 1995. Domestic production improved from 4,499 tons of sugar in 1989/90 to an estimated 52,250 tons
in 1995/96 and is expected to rise further to 74,200 tons in 1996/97, primarily due to the support provided
to KSW under the project; this increased domestic production reflects gross foreign exchange savings of
some US$ 40 million p.a. The project reactivated an important industrial complex, providing direct
employment for 7,600 staff, together with improved health, education and housing, and improved income
earning opportunities for some 1,400 outgrower farm families. However, the agricultural research aspects
(e.g. for cane variety development) were not adequately addressed at the design stage, and were
addressed, somewhat belatedly during project implementation. Nevertheless, despite cost overruns and
some delays in implementation, the project has resulted in an estimated economic rate of return of 23%
(SAR 28%), with the economic benefits resulting from this investment, flowing to the Government, both in
terms of improvement in the balance of payments position and as shareholders in KSW, and to the private
sector. In addition, there is also a fiscal benefit to Government in the taxation being levied on KSW profits.
The financial results indicate that gross profits of 65 % of production value can be expected during the
operational phase. This is high by world comparison, largely due to low labor costs, high import parity
prices due to high transport costs to Uganda, and import duties on sugar. Net profits before taxes are
estimated to be in the order of 24% on turnover, or some USh 12 billion for 1996/97. In view of the
foregoing, project performance is deemed satisfactory. Also, while not specifically stated in the SAR,
the project has made a substantial impact on achieving the Government's objectives of
privatization, while achieving, in particular, the objective of liberalization of sugar manufacturing/
processing activities in Uganda.
7     Sustainability. During the period 1988 to 1995, KSW has demonstrated the management,
technical and operational capability that is required to secure the future of the project beyond the
rehabilitation phase. Sufficient financial returns, crucial to continuing operation and expansion, can be
expected. Planting and harvesting programs are well established. Operational targets should therefore be
achievable, and, as KSW is a fully commercial enterprise with private sector shareholding, the project's
sustainability is likely; recently the private sector has acquired additional shares from the Government,



- iv -
reducing the GOU holdings to 30%. Financial and economic analysis of the project carried out at
completion, indicate that sugar production in Uganda is financially sound and economically viable.
8     Bank and Borrower Performance.    While, during the preparation and appraisal of the
project, optimistic targets were set, and, in some components, the extent of works and equipment involved
and their related costs were under-estimated, this was corrected at the mid-term review. IDA's role in the
supervision of the project has been quite good. The supervision and the mid-term review missions provided
support to the project management in the administration mechanisms of the credit, although World Bank
procedures were perceived by project management to be not entirely suited to a private sector project.
Assistance was provided directly to KSW management by both Bank Headquarters and Resident Mission
staff throughout the project, and an effective working partnership involving Government, the Bank and
KSW was established. This aspect was crucial when implementation delays arose as it enabled the required
flexibility to be incorporated, as illustrated by the adoption of revised capacity and production targets at
MTR. Throughout the project, the Government and management of KSW have shown continuing commitment
to successful implementation, with the exception of the Sugar Industry Unit (SIU) for which adequate budgetary
support was not provided, hampering SIU's capability to be effective in collating updated and reliable industry
related data and information (after trade liberalization was introduced by Government in 1991/92,
sugar price determination by SIT was no longer required, and the perceived importance of the
unit declined sharply). Additionally, when viewed in the context of a forthcoming Agricultural Sector
Management Project, which inter alia seeks to rationalize and strengthen the statistical data and information
collation / dissemination capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture (support will also be provided to the Statistics
Department of the Ministry of Finance ), continued support to the SIU does not appear necessary.
Future Operations and Key Lessons Learnt.
9     A plan for the operational phase of the project was completed by KSW management and forwarded
to MTI for comment. The plan sets out targets for production, operation and maintenance of KSW.
Included in the plan is the construction of an ethanol plant within two years in order to utilize molasses
production in excess of that which can be sold locally. Future plans also include proposals for usefully
disposing excess bagasse resulting from continuing expansion of cane production. KSW has also
developed a "Ugandization" program, for the future replacement of expatriate staff with qualified Ugandan
nationals.
10    The key lessons to be learned from the project are as follows:
(a)   the time frame for importing, transporting and installing the equipment involved in a large
industrial investment project in a land-locked country needs to be set more realistically and
reviewed more closely at the design stage.
(b)    agricultural research aspects were not fully addressed at project design stage. An
agronomic research unit was established towards the end of the project. Cane variety
development requires a long lead time for testing and propagating improved adaptive
varieties, and this should have been addressed in the early stages of the project's
implementation.



(c)    creation of a working partnership between Government and international financing
institutions with joint venture participation with the private sector in implementation can
lead to successful results.
(d)    replacement of expatriate staff by Ugandan nationals was envisaged under the project.
Despite implementing staffing development and training programs, this was not fully
achieved. Constraints not visualized in this case, included the difficulty in attracting
qualified Ugandans from townships or from overseas, to rural areas.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Cr. 1893-UG)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    The principal objectives of the project were to (i) restore sugar production of Kakira
Sugar Works Limited (KSW), a joint venture company owned by East African Holdings Limited
and the Government of Uganda, to historical levels and, by so doing, saving foreign exchange that
would otherwise have been utilized in importing sugar; (ii) strengthen the Ministry of Trade and
Industry's (MTI) (formerly the Ministry of Industry and Technology) management of the sugar
sector; and (iii) support the liberalization of sugar marketing and processing in Uganda.
2.    These objectives were to be achieved through a major investment program of
rehabilitation of the agricultural production (reclaiming and replanting some 7,900 ha and
developing another 4,100 ha of outgrower cane production), as well as of the factory and
infrastructure facilities at Kakira, technical assistance for strengthening of management and
training, and the financing of incremental working capital. In addition, the project was to establish
a Sugar Industry Unit (SIU) within MTI to strengthen the monitoring and coordination role of
Government during the rehabilitation phase of the sugar industry in Uganda, and to introduce an
import parity pricing policy and mechanism for liberalizing sugar marketing. The scheduled
targets for capacity installation/rehabilitation and production were adjusted at the time of the mid-
term review (MTR) in the light of implementation progress and revised costs.
3.    Central to the design of the project was the implementation of the major project activities
through the joint venture company between Government and the private sector (owning the
Kakira complex). Project funds were thus channeled to Kakira Sugar Works Limited through
several subsidiary loan agreements covering Cr. 1 893-UG and other Bank credits, viz., Industrial
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1248-UG), Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1328-UG), and
Second Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 1434-KE), as well as, an African Development Bank
loan and an African Development Fund credit. At the inception of the project, the Government
had a 51 percent shareholding in KSW, which has been reduced in line with Government policy to
the present 30 percent.



B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
4.    Agricultural development objectives have largely been met, but cane yields and quality fell
during 1994/95 due to adverse seasonal conditions. The factory rehabilitation (Phase II) is being
completed and the factory will be rehabilitated to a throughput of 2,500 tons of cane per day (tcd)
during the 1995/96 crushing season. While there were delays in implementing the project, the
MTR objectives for sugar production are expected to be met in 1996/97. The corresponding
import substitution objectives will also be met. Thus, the project has had a substantial effect in
achieving both the macro and sector objectives. Also, while not specifically stated in the SAR, the
project has made a substantial impact on achieving the Government's objectives of privatization,
while achieving, in particular, the objective of liberalization of sugar manufacturing/processing
activities in Uganda.
5.    The sugar market in Uganda is now fully liberalized, both in terms of supply (local and
import) and pricing. However, lack of resources and staff turnover within the SIU is placing
constraints on its capacity to advise and monitor the sugar industry.
C. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
General
6.    At appraisal, the project was envisaged to close in December 1993. The Credit closing
date was however extended to December 31, 1994 and again to March 31, 1995 to accommodate
delays in completion of the factory rehabilitation. Accordingly, the project was implemented over
a period of six and half years.
7.    Overall, the implementation experience has been satisfactory, but has been characterized
by slippages in the time schedule envisaged at both appraisal and mid-term review. While this was
partly caused by procurement related delays, project execution also needed to be phased in
accordance with other factors. On completing Stage I of the factory rehabilitation, the factory
started operations in 1989/90. The second stage of factory rehabilitation to had to be re-
scheduled in accordance with an operational plan that took into account: the availability and best
use of maturing cane under the agricultural development program; the working capital situation of
KSW; and the impact on the national sugar supply position that would have resulted from
extended factory shutdown (for rehabilitation). An action plan to balance these factors was
designed and satisfactorily implemented..
8.    Project management demonstrated a commitment to successful implementation during the
project, but had to deal with a number of procurement problems that were largely outside their
direct control. These included delays in opening letters of credit, delays in shipments from the
suppliers, delivery to Dar-es-Salaam instead of Mombassa, and delays in on-shipments from
Mombassa. A time interval of 12 to 18 months often elapsed between first requisition and delivery
to the site.



- 3 -
9.    In addition, due to cost escalations during the project period and under-estimation at
preparation/appraisal of the scale and cost of works involved in some components, a few activities
needed to be re-scaled (e.g., factory capacity from 3,000 tons down to 2,500 tons of cane per
day; and, reductions in the rehabilitation of works related to infrastructure) or dropped completely
(e.g., irrigation rehabilitation), in order to keep within the levels of available financing. However,
KSW financed some of the activities (some housing rehabilitation and road improvement), from
its internally generated funds; these activities were originally expected to be financed through both
IDA and AfDB/F Credits.
Agricultural Development
10.   While there were some delays in procuring agricultural equipment at the commencement
of the project, the progress with the rehabilitation of the nucleus estate was satisfactory, given
that the cane supply/production levels had to be coordinated with the pace of rehabilitation of the
factory's processing capacity. The present complement of equipment is reported to be adequate
for the operation of the nucleus estate, the outgrowers, and for infrastructural requirements. The
major portion of the new equipment was received between 1989 and 1991 and the replacement
cultivation tractors by 1992. The equipment supplied has given satisfactory service except for a
supply of 30 wheel tractors in 1988/1989. By 1992/93 only 7 of the original 30 units were still
functional.
11.   Bush clearing, cultivation and planting of the 7,840 ha on the nucleus estate has now been
completed in accordance with SAR projections. Progress with cane plantings had to be revised to
be synchronized with factory capacity; the nucleus estate now has a full, steady complement of
5,000 ha of mature cane to be harvested in 1995/96 and subsequent years.
12.   The rehabilitation of the irrigation systems was originally estimated at US$ 1.5 million.
However, when costs were reassessed in detail for these works in 1990, these were estimated to
be around US$ 15 million. The incremental yields expected from irrigation (16 ton per ha per
annum based on pre-1970 levels) would have resulted in an overall increase in sugar production of
7 percent. However, the net value of this incremental production was determined to be insufficient
to support an investment of this scale, and a decision was taken that no rehabilitation of the
irrigation infrastructure would take place.
13.   Historically, under a regime of labor intensive crop husbandry, a liberal use of agricultural
inputs, and one-third of the nucleus estate under overhead irrigation, cane production averaged
779,444 tons of cane p.a. in the period 1967 to 1971, peaking at 853,467 tons in 1970. The Sugar
Rehabilitation project opted for a more sustainable approach, i.e., more economic use of
agricultural inputs, non-irrigation of commercial cane and a less labor intensive agronomic regime.
Accordingly, the SAR projected cane yields at 112 tons per ha for the nucleus estate and 94 tons
per ha for outgrowers, equivalent to about 80 percent of historical yields.
14.   Cane yields on the nucleus estate increased from 45 tons per ha in 1989/90 to 99 tons per
ha in 1992/93, but have fallen again to 92 tons per ha in 1994/95 mainly because of a reduction in
rainfall over the past two years. The yield pattern for outgrowers has been similar to that for the



nucleus estate. Indications are that with reasonably good climatic conditions, both the nucleus
estate and the outgrowers will achieve the SAR yields. In so doing, cane production is estimated
to be 560,000 tons for the estate and 150,000 tons for the outgrowers. Cane quality (as indicated
by pol (sugar) paercentage of cane and fiber percentage of cane), has been lower than projected in
the SAR. Sugar or pol % content is down by 8 percent, while the fiber content is up by 12
percent. With lower than expected cane quality, a further expansion of area under cane, either
outgrower or nucleus estate, should be investigated to raise sugar production to historical levels
of 80,000 tons p.a.
15.   During the early stages of the project, outgrower development was slower than expected -
farmers wanted to see the factory in operation in order to renew their confidence in growing cane.
Once the factory was commissioned, registration of outgrowers proceeded satisfactorily
(currently 1,400 participants) and appraisal targets have been met. Outgrowers interviewed
during the completion mission expressed satisfaction at the positive experience with the scheme.
Farmers in this area of Uganda have a significant proportion of their farms underutilized since
there are few market outlets for cash crops, and their farming systems tend to concentrate on food
production for the household with limited marketable surpluses. While harvest and transport costs
are perceived to be high, there are sufficient financial incentives under the current inputs package
and cane pricing arrangements for continued outgrower interest. However, farmers in general do
not apply fertilizers, and some do not put sufficient effort into weeding. While the outgrower
scheme includes a credit component, with recoveries made from the value of cane deliveries,
extension services under the scheme appear to be inadequate, and farmers lack confidence to incur
additional expense on higher input levels. Addressing these issues would be necessary to increase
outgrower cane yields and financial returns to farmers.
16.   Agricultural research aspects of the project were not addressed fully in the project design.
Cane variety testing involves a minimum of six year lead time, and improvements in cane quality,
both sugar and fiber content, need to be continually sought. The newly established agronomic
research unit requires an enhanced variety evaluation program to identify suitable high quality
cane varieties to increase sugar production from the area available for cultivation. Incidence of
pests and diseases has been kept below economic thresholds, and continued monitoring by the
research unit is essential.
Factory Rehabilitation
17.   The factory rehabilitation program was designed for implementation in two stages. The
first stage was required to make the factory operational, after a closure of four years, in order to
process 108,000 tons of mature cane which would otherwise be abandoned. In the first stage, the
factory was partially restored, utilizing available equipment, and 10,497 tons of sugar was
produced between October, 1989 and August, 1990, at an expectedly low level of efficiency and a
rendement of 6.7 percent. Factory performance and efficiency were subsequently enhanced
considerably by the installation during August to November 1990 of replacement equipment.
During the crop season from November, 1990 to March, 1991, 94,219 tons of cane were



- 5 -
processed to produce 8,401 tons of sugar at a much improved rendement of 8.9 percent, over a
four month period.
18.   After a further four month maintenance/rehabilitation program, the factory entered its
third crushing season from August, 1991 to April 1993, processing 525,527 tons of cane and
producing 47,642 tons of sugar at a rendement of 9.1 percent, over a 20 month period.
19.   The stage II rehabilitation program commenced in mid-1993, and was completed in April,
1995. The stage I1 program was carried out in three phases -- before, during and after the 4th
crop season -- operating from September, 1993 to December, 1994. In this season, 556,703 tons
of cane were processed and 51,248 tons of sugar were made at a rendement of 9.2 percent.
20.   The factory rehabilitation program was delayed mainly by the slow mobilization of
contractors and belated delivery of equipment and materials. The latter was aggravated by a
transport strike in a suppliers' country, rejection of manufactured equipment by inspectors, and
other logistical problems, such as, shipping delays and transportation difficulties between
Mombassa and Jinja, where KSW is located.
21.   Nevertheless, factory performance and operational efficiency improved steadily over the
period of the rehabilitation program. Throughputs increased from 735 tons of cane per day (tcd)
in 90/91 to over 2,000 tcd in 1995. These throughputs were below the SAR targets, but in most
cases were all that was required to accommodate harvesting rates and available cane. As
mentioned earlier, the fiber content in cane was running at higher than historical levels. This,
combined with an increase in thermal efficiency of the factory due to the rehabilitation, resulted in
quantities of bagasse in excess of the factory's energy requirements. While this excess is minor at
present production levels, methods of disposal of future quantities that could be expected with
increasing crushing levels are being considered, particularly for electricity supply to the national
power grid.
22.   The commissioning of the final outstanding equipment, a 3 megawatt turbo generator and
a set of vertical crystallisers will ensure a factory capacity of 2,500 tcd at an acceptable level of
efficiency. Accordingly the factory is considered fully rehabilitated for the processing of crops
from the existing area of cane cultivation. However, the major components of the factory have a
capacity well in excess of 2,500 tcd, and the plant could therefore be inexpensively expanded to
efficiently process an increased tonnage of cane, should additional land be brought under
cultivation.
Infrastructure Development
23.   This component, financed by AfDF, was identified in the SAR at a cost of US$ 8.8
million. A revision of the works and costs involved took place at the mid-term review following
the report of the engineering consultants appointed in 1990 to accurately assess the rehabilitation
requirements. At that time, the full cost of works rehabilitation was estimated at US$ 50 million.
Accordingly KSW management, in consultation with IDA, AfDB and AfDF, redesigned the
infrastructure component within a budget of US$ 9.8 million -- the extent of funds that were



- 6 -
available. In addition, KSW undertook to finance, from internally generated funds, certain priority
items - labor camp facilities, water supply and some housing. At the time of preparing this ICR,
the revised infrastructure program was largely completed with the outstanding works envisaged to
be completed shortly.
Staffing
24.   The project provided for recruitment of internationally experienced personnel initially; the
expatriate staff would be replaced by Ugandan nationals by the end of the project. As against a
provision of 278 person years, the project utilized 341 person years of expatriate TA, but stayed
within the total cost estimate. The KSW expects this level of staffing to continue through 2003,
when the number of expatriate staff is expected to be reduced to 15, as against six proposed by
the end of the project in the SAR.
25.   This additional expatriate requirement is, in part, the result of the difficulty experienced by
KSW in attracting qualified Ugandans to KSW from other townships or from overseas. As
employee confidence develops with the continued growth of the project, and the results of the
training program take effect, the replacement of expatriate staff with Ugandan nationals will be
facilitated. KSW have set out a program for the future replacement of expatriate staff, which is
provided in the Borrower's Final Evaluation Report.
26.   KSW employs approximately 7,600 workers, of whom some 4,140 are permanent
employees. Most permanent employees are resident at Kakira with their families and are entitled
to subsidized housing, rations, medical and educational facilities.
Training
27.   In 1990, intemational consultants were commissioned to prepare a four year training
program which would put in place a sustainable training facility equipped to develop staffing skills
at all levels, and to ultimately facilitate the replacement of expatriate staff by Ugandan nationals,
at KSW.
28.   A training unit has been established with a Training Manager, a Technical Training
Officer and a Manpower Planning and Development Officer, together with support staff and
classroom facilities for 90 students.
29.   Under the project-supported training program, 25 employees benefited from overseas
training, some 56 staff attended courses at local training institutions or received on-the-job
training. The training program was broad-based, with 78 managers/professionals receiving in-
house and external training, over 280 technicians/ supervisors receiving training in Uganda (272)
and overseas (10), and some 325 craftsmen and operatives receiving in-country training. A total
of 17 Ugandan nationals received management training; and over 150 staff have benefited from
the skills enhancement training program.



30.   The training center requires some additional equipment - overhead projectors, videos,
computers, photocopiers; also there is a perceived need for the appointment of additional
vocational training officers to accelerate in-house training and thereby contribute to the overall
sustainability of the project.
Sugar Industry Unit
31.   A Sugar Industry Unit was set up within the Ministry of Trade and Industry as a project
requirement to monitor the implementation of the project at KSW together with the rehabilitation
activities at two other sugar factories, Lugazi and Kenyala. Initially the SIU was also responsible
for regulating sugar supplies and sugar prices within the country, and the SIU was staffed by a
head (senior economist) with adequate statistical and secretarial support staff, in accordance with
the project design. The SRI carried out the market information and coordination role as planned.
However, after trade liberalization was introduced by the Government of Uganda in 1991/92,
sugar price determination by SIU was no longer required, and the perceived importance of the.
unit declined sharply. Staff and budgetary resources to the SIU were reduced to the point that, at
the completion of the project, the SIU consisted of only the present officer-in -charge, engaged
part-time on SIU activities. As a result, the unit could no longer effectively monitor the affairs of
the sugar industry and provide Government with pertinent statistical information for sugar policy
formulation.
32.   This Unit has provided a linkage between industry and Government during liberalization,
and during the ongoing rehabilitation of the industry. However, while the current staff resources
are not considered adequate for the Unit to be effective as a locus for collecting and disseminating
up to date and reliable sugar industry related data and information, such support to the SIU may
no longer be necessary, in view of a forthcoming Agricultural Sector Management Project, which
inter alia seeks to rationalize and strengthen the statistical data and information collation, analysis
and dissemination capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries; support
will also be provided under this project to the Statistics Department of the Ministry of Finance.
Major Constraints
33.   The major constraints associated with implementation, and discussed above, are
recapitulated below:
(a)   the administrative and logistical difficulties associated with procurements of
machinery and equipment;
(b)   scheduling of rehabilitation works concurrent with continuing factory operations;
(c)    mobilization and performance of contractors.
Project Benefits
34.   The direct and indirect benefits resulting from the project are:



- 8 -
(a)   domestic production improved from 4,500 tons of sugar in 1989/90 to about
52,250 tons in 1995/96, and is expected to rise further to about 74,000 tons in
1996/97,
(b)   gross foreign exchange savings of about US$ 40 million p.a.(despite the highly
favorable conditions for in-country sugar production, at project inception,
Ugandan imports of sugar were about US$ 20 million p.a., ranking second only to
petroleum imports);
(c)   direct employment for 7,600 staff, together with improved health, education and
housing facilities;
(d)   improved income earning opportunities for about 1,400 outgrower farm families;
(e)   reactivating an existing industrial complex which, directly and indirectly, provides
economic benefits to a large number of Ugandans;
(f)   contribution to overall macro-economic recovery during a period of rehabilitation
and reconstruction.
35.   A major benefit of the project has been the impact on the balance of payments position of
Uganda. As anticipated at appraisal, significant direct benefits from project investment have
accrued to both the shareholders of KSW, and the outgrower farmers supplying cane to the
factory. There is also a fiscal benefit to Government in the taxation being levied on profits of KSW.
Project Costs and Financing
36.   Total project costs were US$ 78.2 million, compared to the SAR estimate of US$ 61.5
million. Total incremental working capital amounted to some US$ 18.5 million (SAR US$ 11.0),
with capital costs equal to US$ 59.6 million (SAR US$ 50.5). External financing by IDA, AfDB
and AfDF were denominated in SDR and in Unit of Account (UA), respectively. Due to changes
in cross rates between US$ and SDR, and US$ and UA (appreciation of SDR and UA against the
US$), additional funds were available in terms of US$. At appraisal, IDA financing for the
project -- in addition to the US$ 24.9 million under the proposed Credit (Cr. 1893-UG) --
included transfers from the following three IDA credits: (a) US$ 3.6 million under the
Agricultural Rehabilitation project (Cr. 1328-UG) for the refurbishment, storage and shipping of
equipment, (b) US$0.35 million under the Second Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 1434-UG)
for a first phase of factory engineering services to KSW; and (c) US$3.6 million to KSW as a sub-
project under the Industrial Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1248-UG) for the procurement of
machinery and agricultural inputs. The proposed new IDA credit of US$24.9 million was to
finance factory rehabilitation beyond Phase I requirements covered under ongoing credits, for
foreign exchange costs of remunerations to KSW expatriate staff, incremental factory inputs, and
institutional support to MTI. At project closing, the total financing by IDA is estimated at
US$36.5 million, of which some US$27.9 million was disbursed under Cr. 1893-UG. The credit



was closed on March 31, 1995. Final disbursement took place on November 6, 1995, at which
time a balance of SDR 0.16 million (equivalent to US$0.24 million) was canceled. The
undisbursed balances in the AfDF credit and AfDB loan, (both closing on December 31, 1995) at
the time of preparing this report (August 1995) amounted to UA 2.6 million (US$ 3.8 million)
and UA 1.36 million (US$ 1.95 million), respectively.
Economic and Financial Aspects
37.   An economic analysis of the project has been undertaken at completion on a similar basis
as that contained in the SAR. The results are provided in Part II, Table 9. The reduced scale of
the project, combined with increased project costs has had the effect of reducing the economic
rate of return from the 28 percent anticipated at the time of appraisal to 23 percent, which is
nevertheless still a very attractive rate of return on the investments. Due to the comparative agro-
climatic and labor cost advantages of Uganda, and the costs involved in importing commodities
through Kenya or Tanzania, the analysis shows that sugar production for domestic consumption
remains economically sound and well justified.
38.   The project has also resulted in the additional employment opportunities for the local
population, and provides seasonal work for cane cutters from northern districts of Uganda and
income generation opportunities for outgrower farm families.
39.   KSW's overheads, built up in a period when sugar revenues were lower than expected,
were financed by KSW from its own funds. In addition, some essential works originally
envisaged to be financed by IDA or AfDB/F were also financed by KSW. This placed some
financial constraints on KSW during the implementation period. Nevertheless, KSW, from profits
generated by the end of the project, has commenced repayment of loans in accordance with the
respective Subsidiary Loan Agreements.
40.   Import duties on sugar result in financial prices being higher than economic prices for
sugar, and the financial returns for 1996/97, the first year of full production, are estimated to be
around USh 12 billion (about US$ 12 million), representing a return of 24 percent on turnover,
before taxes. Details of these estimates are in Part II, Table 9.
41.   In these circumstances, sugar production in Uganda is currently financially viable as well
as economically sound.
Environment
42.   The project has led to no adverse environmental implications. Factory waste water is
treated in effluent ponds adjacent to the factory. The main by-products are: filter press mud, used
as a fertilizer on the estate; bagasse, which is the energy source for the factory; and molasses
which is temporarily stored in tanks before being disposed of locally as an input to distillation
processes and as an animal feed supplement.

D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
43.   During the period 1988 to 1995, KSW has demonstrated the management, technical and
operational capability that is required to secure the future of the project beyond the rehabilitation
phase. The sustainability of the project is dependent on the financial returns generated in the
future, and as mentioned above, sufficient financial returns can be expected. With a sustainable
harvesting program, operational targets should be achievable and, as KSW is a fully viable
commercial enterprise with major private sector shareholding, the project's sustainability is likely.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
44.   The mission considers that, during the preparation and appraisal of the project, optimistic
time/completion targets were set; additionally, for some components, the extent of works and
equipment involved (hence, related costs) was underestimated. This was corrected by the mid-
term review. IDA's role in the supervision of the project has been very good. The supervision and
the mid-term review missions provided support to the project management in the administration
mechanisms of the credit, although Bank procedures were perceived by the project management
to be not entirely suited to a private sector project. Assistance was provided directly to KSW
management by both Headquarters and Resident Mission staff throughout the project, and a
working partnership involving Government, the World Bank and KSW was established. This
aspect was crucial when delays arose as it permitted the required flexibility to be incorporated in
project execution, illustrated by the adoption of revised processing capacity and production
targets.
45.   The Bank also recognized the procurement and disbursement difficulties being
experienced, addressed this problem by sending a special IDA mission in 1991 to investigate the
slow disbursements in IDA (and IFAD) assisted projects in the Agricultural sector. Towards the
end of the project, disbursement issues were addressed by the Resident Mission when it assumed
responsibility for pre-screening withdrawal applications for disbursements.
F. BOROWER PERFORMANCE
46.   Throughout the project cycle, the Government and management of KSW have shown
continued commitment to successful project implementation, with the exception of the SIU for
which adequate budgetary support was not provided. In general, there has been compliance with
Bank Operational Statements, and the covenants contained in the agreements have been complied
with. The project management provided a draft "Borrower's Final Evaluation Report" as part of
the ICR procedures.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
47.   In summary, the overall outcome of the project is deemed satisfactory, in view of its
significant contribution to the successful restoration of domestic sugar production capacity at
Kakira, and the indirect boost to Government's efforts to rebuild the economy of Uganda.



- 11 -
Domestic production improved from 4,499 tons of sugar in 1989/90 to an estimated 52,250 tons
in 1995/96 and is expected to rise further to 74,200 tons in 1996/97, primarily due to the support
provided to KSW under the project; this increased domestic production reflects gross foreign
exchange savings of some US$ 40 million p.a. The project reactivated an important industrial
complex, providing direct employment for 7,600 staff, together with improved health, education
and housing, and improved income earning opportunities for some 1,400 outgrower farmers.
During implementation of the factory rehabilitation program, factory performance and operational
efficiency improved steadily. Throughputs increased from 735 tons of cane per day (tcd) in 90/91
to over 2,000 tcd in 1995. Despite cost overruns and some delays in implementation, the project
has resulted in an estimated economic rate of return of 23% (SAR 28%), with the economic
benefits resulting from this investment, flowing to the Government, both in terms of improvement
in the balance of payments position and as shareholders in KSW, and to the private sector. The
financial results indicate that gross profits of 65% of production value can be expected during
the operational phase. This is high by world comparison, largely due to low labor costs, high
import parity prices due to high transport costs to Uganda, and import duties on sugar. Net
profits before taxes are estimated to be in the order of 24% on turnover, in the region of USh
12 billion for 1996/97. The agricultural research aspects (e.g. for cane variety development),
however, were not adequately addressed at the design stage, and were addressed somewhat
belatedly during project implementation. The key objectives of the project will be fully achieved
during the operational phase.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
48.   A plan for the operational phase of the project was completed by KSW management and
forwarded to MTI for comment. The plan sets out targets for production, operation and
maintenance of KSW. Included in the plan is the construction of an ethanol plant within two years
in order to utilize surplus molasses (in excess of that which can be sold locally) production. Future
plans also include proposals for usefuil disposal of excess bagasse resulting from continuing
expansion of outgrower participation in cane production. A program for the Ugandaization of
KSW staff has also been elaborated, which sets out arrangements for future replacement of
expatriate staff by qualified Ugandans.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
49.   The key lessons to be learned from the project are as follows:
(a)   the time frame for importing, transporting, installing and operationalizing the
equipment involved in a large industrial investment project in a land-locked
country as well as the costs related to major infrastructure rehabilitation and



- 12 -
construction works, needs to be established more realistically and reviewed more
closely at the design stage;
(b)   agricultural research aspects were not fully addressed at project design stage. An
agronomic research unit was established towards the end of the project. Cane
variety development requires a long lead time for testing and propagating
improved adaptive varieties, and this should have been addressed at the early stage
of the project's implementation;
(c)   creation of a working partnership between Government and intemational financing
institutions with joint venture participation of the private sector in implementation
can lead to successful results, if there is an adequate commitment by all parties;
and
(d)   replacement of expatriate staff by Ugandan nationals was envisaged under the
project. Despite implementing staffing development and training programs, this
was not fully achieved. Constraints not envisaged in this case, included the
difficulty in attracting qualified Ugandans from townships or from overseas to rural
areas.

Table 9: Economic and Financial Costs and Benefits
An economic analysis on the same basis as set out in the SAR has been carried out, and the details are
provided in Part III, Table 1. The economic analysis was undertaken using 1995 constant US$. Import
parity prices for sugar have been calculated for each year of project investment, and have been
projected in accordance with Bank commodity price projections for the operational phase of the
project. Investment costs are actual costs, adjusted to constant values. Recurrent costs have been based
on infornation provided by the project management concerning input cost structures, with adjustments
made for import taxes on imported process materials, and an adjustment for the value of labor to half
of the financial price has also been taken into consideration. As there exists a free foreign exchange
market in Uganda, no adjustment for currency distortions has been considered necessary.
The main justification for the project was the impact of domestic sugar production on the balance of
payments position of Government. The economic benefits resulting from investment in domestic sugar
production have been proven to be substantial, particularly in view of the investment being directed
towards the rehabilitation of an existing facility, with substantial sunk costs involved.
At appraisal, the economic internal rate of return was estimated at 28 %. Due to delays in project
activities resulting in production lags, and some cost increases, the economnic rate of return is now
estimated at 23 %.
The SAR also set out a financial analysis and projections for KSW. Since the accounts prepared by
KSW available to the mission were prepared for taxation purposes, and the accounting treatment for
many items is on a different basis from that set out in the SAR, it is not possible to compare the formal
accounts with the SAR projected accounts. It was also not possible to disaggregate and reconstruct the
historical financial statements of KSW to enable a comparison to be made. However, an analysis of the
fixed and variable costs structure of KSW has been completed to give an indication of expected levels
of financial profitability during the operation phase of the project. The details of this analysis are in
Part III, Table 2.
The financial results indicate that gross profits of 65 % of production value can be expected during the
operational phase. This is high by world comparison, largely due to low labor costs, high import parity
prices due to high transport costs to Uganda, and import duties on sugar. Net profits before taxes are
estimated to be in the order of 24% on turnover, in the region of USh 12 billion for 1996/97.
Financial benefits flow to the shareholders of KSW, namely Government of Uganda and East Africa
Holdings Limited, and to outgrowers supplying cane to KSW. There is also a fiscal benefit to
Government in the taxation being levied on profits of KSW.

project. The Mission held discussions with relevant officials from the Ministry of Trade and
Industry (MTI), Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP) and visited Kakira Sugar
Works (KSW) at Jinja. The Mission worked closely with the senior management of KSW and
staff of the Project Implementation Unit. A wrap-up meeting was held on 14 July, 1995 at MTI.
The FAOR, Uganda was briefed on the outcome of the Mission.
2.    The Mission would like to express their appreciation for the assistance given by the
officials of Government, and the cooperation and hospitality of the management and staff of KSW
during the Mission.
Project Objectives
3.    The objective of the project was to (i) restore KSW's sugar production to historical levels
and, by so doing, saving foreign exchange that would otherwise have been utilized in importing
sugar, (ii) strengthen MTI's management of the sugar sector; (iii) provide a mechanism for
liberalizing sugar marketing and processing. These objectives were to be achieved through a
major investment programme of rehabilitation of the agricultural production, factory and
infrastructure facilities at Kakira, technical assistance for strengthening of management and
training, and the financing of incremental working capital. In addition, the project was to establish
a Sugar Industry Unit (SIU) within MTI to strengthen the monitoring and coordination role of
Government during the rehabilitation phase of the sugar industry in Uganda, and to introduce an
import parity pricing policy and mechanism for liberalizing sugar marketing. The targets for
capacity and sugar production were adjusted at the time of the mid-term review in the light of
implementation progress and the revised costs.
4.           Agricultural development objectives have largely been met, but cane yields and
quality fell duing 1994/95 due to the seasonal conditions. The factory rehabilitation (Phase II) was
completed and the factory commenced full operations on 16 April, 1995. Therefore, whilst there

(Sugar Technologist - Consultant).

were delays in implementing the project, the revised objectives for sugar production are expected
to be met in 1996/97, the year of expected steady-state conditions. The corresponding import
substitution objectives will also be met.
5.    The sugar market in Uganda is now fully liberalized, both in terms of supply (local and
import) and pricing. However, lack of resources and staff turnover within the SIU is placing
constraints on its capacity to advise and monitor the sugar industry.
Implementation Experience and Results
6     General. Overall, the implementation experience has been satisfactory, but has been
characterized by slippages in the time scale anticipated at both appraisal and mid-term review.
Whilst this was caused by delays in the procurement processes, implementation also needed to be
phased in accordance with other factors. After the factory started operations in 1989/90 at Stage I
levels, factory rehabilitation to Stage II levels had to be worked in with an operational plan that
took into account the best use of maturing cane under the agricultural development programme,
the working capital position of KSW, and the impact on the national sugar supply position that
would have resulted from extended factory shutdown. An action plan to balance these factors was
implemented, albeit behind the appraisal schedule.
7.    Project management demonstrated a commitment to successful implementation during the
project, but had to deal with a continual set of procurement problems that were largely outside
their direct control. These included delays in opening L/Cs, delays in shipments from the country
of origin, delivery to Dar es Salaam instead of Mombasa, and delays in on-shipments from
Mombasa. A time interval of 12 to 18 months often occurred between first requisition and
delivery to the site.
8.    In addition, due to cost escalations during the project period and incorrect assessments at
preparation/appraisal of the scale and cost of works involved, some activities needed to be re-
scaled (factory capacity from 3,000 to 2,500 tons of cane per day, infrastructure) or dropped
completely (irrigation rehabilitation) in order to keep within the upper level of the financing
arrangements that were in place. However, KSW internally financed some of the activities that
were originally expected to be financed through both IDA and AfDB/F credits (some housing
rehabilitation and some road improvement). These issues were addressed at the time of the mid-
term review.
9.    Agricultural Development. Bush clearing on the nucleus estate was completed in
1990/91. Progress with cane plantings had to be revised to be synchronized with factory capacity
but the estate is now fully developed, in excess of 7,000 ha of standing cane.



- 3 -
10.   he slippage in Stage II contract by an additional 6 months, and two years of drought (1993
and 1994) resulted in delivery to the factory of over-mature and sub-standard cane during
1994/95.
11.   The rehabilitation of the irrigation systems was originally estimated at US$ 1.5 million.
However, when costs were reviewed for these works in 1990, the costs were in the region of US$
15 million. The incremental yields expected from irrigation (16 ton per ha p.a. based on pre 1970
levels) would have resulted in an overall increase in sugar production of 7%. However, the net
value of this production was determined to be insufficient to support an investment of this cost,
and a decision was taken that no rehabilitation of the irrigation would take place. This has
therefore had an effect on cane yields and quality in the areas of the estate that would have been
irrigated (1,800 ha), especially in the light of the recent drought experienced in the area.
12.   During the early stages of the project, outgrower development was slower than expected -
farmers wanted to see the factory in operation in order to renew their confidence in growing cane.
Registration then proceeded satisfactorily (currently 1,400 participants) and targets have been
met. However, farmers in general do not apply fertilizers, and do not put sufficient effort into
weeding which, together with the drought mentioned above, has resulted in outgrower yield levels
lower than expected.
13.   Outgrowers that were interviewed during the mission expressed positive experience with
the scheme. Farmers in this area of Uganda have a significant proportion of their farms unutilized
since there are few market outlets for cash crops, and their farming systems tend to concentrate
on food production for the household with limited marketable surpluses. Whilst harvest and
transport costs are perceived to be high, there are sufficient financial incentives under the current
input package and cane pricing arrangements for continued interest.
14.   Agricultural research aspects of the project were not addressed fully in the project design.
Cane variety testing through to use involves a minimum of six year lead time, and improvements
in cane quality, both pol and fiber in cane, need to be continually sought. Whilst the incidence of
pests and diseases has been kept below economic thresholds, further varietal and agronomic
research would also lead to improved productivity.
15.   Factory Rehabilitation. The original SAR estimates of the time required for the
implementation of the factory rehabilitation component were very tight and not achieved in the
early stages. The mid-term review (MTR) set a more realistic set of physical targets, 2,500 tons of
cane per day (tcd) capacity and 74,200 tons of sugar produced by end 1993. However, further
delays in completing Stage II resulted in Phase III (of Stage II) taking place during the period
November, 1994 to April, 1995, and the factory commenced the current crushing season on 16
April, 1995 at 2,000 to 2,200 tcd. With the completion of the vertical crystallizers and the
commissioning of the turbo alternator, factory efficiency will be in line with design expectations at
a capacity of 2,500 tcd. Poor cane quality has resulted in rendement levels in the region of 8.5%
to 9%, lower than MTR revised targets of 10. 5%.

16.   Infrastructure Development. This component was revised at the mid-term review
following the report of the engineering consultants appointed in 1990 to accurately assess the
rehabilitation requirements. This component, financed by AfDF, is now complete with the
exception of Water Works I (40% complete), where the contractor is facing difficulties with its
bankers, and rehabilitation of housing (currently 1,440 out of 1,850 complete) which is expected
to be completed by loan closing on 31 December, 1995.
17.   Staffing and Training. KSW currently employs 4,139 permanent staff, (SAR 4,300),
plus another 3,500 contract workers. Placing of expatriate staff was subject to delays initially and
key positions were not completely filled until 1991/92.
18.   Consultants were appointed to develop a comprehensive training program to satisfy the
training requirements at all levels. The program has been adequately implemented through the
provision of a training institute and the provision of both local and overseas training opportunities.
The program, in its three years of operation, has provided training to about 400 employees, of
which 25 were overseas courses. The program is a necessary pre-requisite for the localization of
positions currently held by expatriate staff. Since the rehabilitation program has been extended,
the extension of employment of expatriate staff in the short term is expected. The operational plan
submitted by KSW (see below) includes details of the schedule for the replacement of expatriate
staff with national staff, with expatriate numbers, presently 56, reducing to 22 by 1997.
19.   Sugar Industry Unit. Initially, the SIU was staffed by a head (senior economist) with
adequate statistical and secretarial support staff, in accordance with the project design. The SIU
carried out the market information and coordination role as planned but, following the
deregulation of the industry in 1992, staff has reduced and, at completion of the project, consisted
of only the present officer in charge, engaged part-time on SIU activities.
20.   This Unit has provided a linkage between industry and Government during liberalization,
and during the ongoing rehabilitation of the industry. However, the current staff resources are not
considered adequate for the Unit to be effective.
21.   Project Costs and Financing. Total project costs were US$ 75.53 million, compared to
the SAR estimate of US$ 61.5 million. Total incremental working capital amounted to US$ 18
million (SAR US$ 11.0), with capital costs equal to US$ 57.3 million (SAR US$ 50.5). Changes
in both the SDR/US$ and UAIUS$ exchange rates in which the credit agreements were
denominated have resulted in increases in funds available in US$ terms. Final withdrawal
applications under IDA Cr 1893-UG have been submitted and an undisbursed amount of SDR .5
million (US$ .8 million) is expected to remain. The Special account under Cr 1893-UG will be
closed on 31 July, 1995. The undisbursed balances in the AfDF credit and AfDB loan, both
closing on 31 December, 1995 are currently UA 2.6 million (US$ 3.8 million) and UA 1.36
million (US$ 1.95 million) respectively.
22.   Financial and Economic Aspects. KSW's overheads built up in a period when sugar
revenues were lower than expected, and it has had to finance, from its own funds, some essential



- 5 -
works originally to be financed by IDA or AfDB/F. This has placed some financial constraints on
KSW during the implementation period. KSW has also imported sugar in the past 2 to 3 years to
keep up national supply and market presence. KSW has commenced repayment of loans under the
respective Subsidiary Loan Agreements.
23.   On the economics side, whilst a full analysis has not yet been completed, clearly the
reduced scale of the project with increased project costs must have some effect on reducing the
economic rate of return from that anticipated at the time of appraisal (28%). However, due to the
comparative agro-climatic and labor cost advantages of Uganda, and the costs involved in
importing commodities through Kenya or Tanzania, sugar production for domestic consumption
is economically sound.
24.   Bank Performance. The mission feels that the preparation and appraisal of the project set
unrealistic time targets and underestimated, in some components, the extent of works and
equipment involved. This was corrected by the mid-term review. IDA's role in the supervision of
the project has been very satisfactory. The supervision missions and the mid-term review mission
provided support to the project management in the administration of the mechanisms of the credit,
although WB procedures were perceived by the project management to be not entirely suited to a
private sector project. Assistance was provided directly to KSW management by both Washington
and Resident Mission staff throughout the project, and a working partnership involving
Government, WB and KSW was established. This aspect was crucial when implementation delays
arose as it enabled the required flexibility to be incorporated, for example, in the revised capacity
and production targets and the extension of the closing date for the credit.
25.   The Bank also recognized the procurement and disbursement difficulties being
experienced, and reacted by sending a special IDA mission in 1991 to investigate the slow
disbursements in both IDA and IFAD assisted projects in the Agricultural sector.
26.   Borrower Performance. Throughout the project, the Govermnent and management of
KSW have shown continuing commitment to successful implementation, with the exception of the
SIU. In general, there has been compliance with Bank Operational Statements, and the covenants
contained in the agreements have been complied with. The project management provided a draft
"Borrower's Final Evaluation Report" as part of the ICR procedures.
27.   Major Constraints. The major constraints associated with implementation have been: the
administrative and logistical difficulties associated with procurements; scheduling of
rehabilitation works concurrent with continuing factory operations; mobilization and
performance of contractors.
Project Benefits
28.   The direct and indirect benefits resulting from the project are:



- 6 -
(a)   domestic production of in excess of 55,000 tons of sugar in 1995/96, rising to
74,200 in 1996/97;
(b)   gross foreign exchange savings in the region of US$ 40 million p.a.;
(c)   direct employment for 8,200 staff, together with improved health, education and
housing; improved income earning opportunities for 1,400 outgrower farmers;
(d)   contribution to overall macro-economic recovery during a period of rehabilitation
and deregulation.
Future Operations
29.   A plan for the operational phase of the project has been completed by KSW management
and forwarded to MTI for comment. The plan sets out targets for production, operation and
maintenance of KSW. Included in the plan is the construction of an ethanol plant within two years
in order to utilize molasses production in excess of that which can be sold locally. A statement on
Government policy concerning ethanol is awaited. Future plans also include a co-generation plant
that would be necessary to usefully dispose of excess bagasse resulting from continuing expansion
of outgrower participation in cane production. With a return to normal seasonal conditions, more
cane supply, and variety improvements resulting in higher yields and quality, these operational
targets should be achievable and, as KSW is a fully commercial enterprise with private sector
shareholding, the mission's assessment of the sustainability of the project is "likely".
Lessons Learnt
30.   The key lessons learnt from the project were as follows:
(a)   the time frames for importing, transporting and installing the equipment involved in
a large industrial investment project in a land-locked country need to be set more
realistically and considered more closely at the design stage.
(b)   the agricultural research aspects of this type of project need to be brought out in
the design, and put in place early in the project due to the long lead time involved
in testing and propagating improved adapted varieties;
(c)   creation of a working partnership between Government and international financing
institutions with joint venture participation with the private sector in
implementation can lead to successful results.
Follow-up



- 7 -
31.   On return to Rome, the mission will prepare a draft ICR to be forwarded to IDA by the
beginning of August, 1995.
Items Outstanding.
32.   Preparation and Audit of 1994/95 Accounts. Preparation of the accounts is expected to
be completed by 22 July, and the audit process will take place between 1 August and 14 August,
1995, with the result that the audited accounts should be available by the deadline of 31 August,
1995.
33.   Outgrower Road Maintenance. Project management and Government have commenced
discussions concerning the arrangements for the sharing of costs for road maintenance in the
outgrower area as set out in the Development Credit Agreement. KSW has not claimed
reimbursement from outgrowers for these costs, and have submitted a claim to Government for
maintenance of 25 km of roads. In addition, KSW is claiming reimbursement from Government
for the cost of equipment for the maintenance of outgrower roads, in accordance with the SAR
(section 4.13).

BORROWER'S FINAL EVALUATION REPORT
1.0 Proiect Obiectives
1.1 The objectives of the project were, as recorded in the Staff Appraisal Report,
over a six year period, to
(i)   Restore KSW's sugar production from then zero level to historical levels
and save foreign exchange used for imports.
(ii)  provide a mechanism for liberalising sugar marketing and prices.
1.2  Essentially and primarily it was intended to rehabilitate the sugar factory at
Kakira and bring it back to its 1972 level of production. As the factory was the
largest processing unit in Uganda, its revival was essential to boost economic
activity and confidence in Uganda's industrial growth. A direct consequence of
this factory rehabilitation would be to save considerable and precious foreign
exchange to the country. As Uganda is land locked and provides a convenient
natural barrier to dumping of imported sugar, at import parity prices sugar
production would not only be a remunerative undertaking but also conserve
foreign exchange for other essential purchases.
1.3  With the gradual increase in production levels, rationing of sugar across the
country and price restrictions would become redundant and at full production,
there would automatically be a case for free market distribution and pricing
liberalisation. In future this would lead to export opportunities for the Ugandan
sugar industry.

2.0 Design of Proiect
2.1  The Rehabilitation Project was structured as under to achieve the above stated
objectives:
(a)  Provision of agricultural machinery and equipment, civil works and
vehicles for agricultural development, involving the rehabilitation of cane
production on 7935 ha of estate area and establishing 4,100 ha of
outgrower area (US$ 12.0 M).
(b)  Provision of factory equipment and technical assistance (engineering
supervision) for phased rehabilitation of the sugar factory to a capacity of
3,000 TCD; a major part of rehabilitation to be undertaken using
equipment procured earlier by the Government for Kakira but never
installed (US$ 20.0 M).
(c)  Civil works, vehicles, equipment and technical assistance (engineering
supervision) for rehabilitation of infrastructure including housing, utilities,
roads, social facilities, etc. (US$ 7.3 M).
(d)  Technical assistance for strengthening of management and training (US$
9.9M) and
(e)  Financing of KSW's incremental working capital requirements in support
of the company's initial operations (US$ I 1 .0 M).
.13



-     3     -
2.2  The design of the project was fairly comprehensive, but in retrospect has
revealed certain weakness in the assumptions and estimates. A Mid Term
Review undertaken by a joint World Bank - AfDB/AfDF Mission in November,
1991 addressed the appropriateness of objectives and set revised targets based
on more accurate information. There were significant cost increases on opening
of tender packages, and hence KSW jointly with the mission scaled down the
production target to 2500 TCD at the end of project rather than 3000 TCD as
originally contemplated.
2.3  Accordingly the revised targets were quantified as:
Original Target    Revised Target
T/Y                T/Y
Cane Production          803,200             700,000
Estate                   576,300             550,000
Outgrowers               243,700             150,000
Sugar Production          84,300              74,200
2.4  The original design of the infrastructure rehabilitation involvecd construction of
54 new houses, renovation of 350 staff houses and 2800 tenements; constructioln
of 3.5 KM of new water supply pipelines, with a new chlorine dosing system,
resurfacing of 11.3 KM of tarmac roads, technical assistance for 36 months for
engineering supervision, repair of 7 irrigation pumps and 2.2 KM of main water
pipeline and replacement of one-third of the portable irrigation equipment.
.14

2.5  After detailed survey, an independent consultant firm appointed under the
project, estimated the total funds requirement for the rehabilitation contemplated
under para 2.4 above at US$ 50 millions which was far in excess of project
provisions. Further the irrigation component was estimated to be US$ 15M
against provision of US$ 1.5M., and could not be economically justified in
terms of additional cane yield.
2.6  Consequently, the infrastructure component was redesigned for a total budget of
US$ 9.8 million to cover:
(a)  raw water supply and irrigation (main station alone) - US$ 1.2 m.
(b)  treated water supply for domestic use - US$ 0.73 M.
(c)  water supply to labour camps - US$ 1.41 M.
(d)  Strengthening the existing electrical system - US$ 0.28M.
(e)  power lines to labour camps - US$ 0.78 M.
(f)  rehabilitation of labour housing - US$ 3.5 M.
(g)  Agricultural office, laboratory and seed water treatment plant building -
US$ 0.31 M.
(h)  rest rooms, canteen and toilet - US$ 0.28M.
.J5



5
(i)  telecommunication and radio links - US$ 0.42M.
(j)  road works - US$ 0.9M.
2.7  The shortcomings on the overall design of project were also in other areas:
(a)  Utilisation of molasses/by products and cogeneration based on bagasse
were ignored.
(b)  The achievement of economies of scale - ultimate growth possibilitics of
plant were not addressed.
3.0  IMPLEMENTATION & OPERATIONS
3.1  The agricultural development in terms of estate rehabilitation and planting in
outgrower areas was initially progressing slower than targeted owing to lengthy
delays in procurement of the heavy agricultural machinery and equipment to
prepare land. The lighter Reggiane equipment proved to be inadequate for the
work to be undertaken. The delays of over two years has been recorded as delays
by the International Financial Institutions tying up the credit agreements, delays
in Uganda Commercial Bank in opening L.Cs, and temporary suspension of
disbursements from ADF/ADB.
3.2  However, on an overall basis, the implementation  of the agricultural
development component is satisfactory, especially with regard to land area to be
brought under cane. Shortfalls in yield and pol % cane against targets were a
consequence of successive droughts, and normalcy in rainfall will restore the
desired levels in yield per hectare and pol % cane.
...16



-     6     -
3.3 Stage-I Factory Rehabilitation was delayed by 10 months and this was chiefly
attributable to unduly lengthy procedures adopted by local commercial banks
and their overseas correspondents in opening LCs.
3.4  Stage-I rehabilitation completed in October 1989 did not bring sustained
operational capacity to the envisaged 1200 TCD, because of problems with old
cane carriers, restricted capacity of the clarifier, inferior quality of existing
vacuum filters, and limited capacity of the evaporators. Corrective action was
taken and procurement of additional new equipment erected during shut downs
between consecutive interim crushings helped to increase effective production
capacity, ensuring that matured cane was harvested and milled.
3.5  The Stage-II Rehabilitation of the factory was completed in 3 phases, and the
factory commenced crushing on 16th April, 1995 after completion of Stage-Il
works and no-load trials. The production is already over 2,000 TCD and is
expected to gradually come upto full capacity in a couple of months once our
Franco Toshi Turbo Alternator is commissioned. The delays in completion of
Stage-II works were due to delays by contractors in supply of materials, opening
of L.Cs and rejections by inspection agencies and departmental erection of
Franco Toshi T.A. which was delayed due to non arrival of spares fi-om
Reggiane, Italy.
3.6  The progress on infrastructure development is fairly satisfactory with substantial
completion in the Electrical Works, Water Treatment Plant and
Telecommunications Contract. About 60% of the housing rehabilitation was
completed, delays chiefly due to shifting of labour families to temporary shelters
and back to rehabilitated houses. Contractor defaults on the Main Water Works
has led to delays in supplies. Balance work on both these contracts is expected
to be completed by end December, 1995.
.J7



-  7     -
3.7 The Government of Uganda in March, 1991 abandoned the system of
administratively determining producer and consumer prices for sugar. This
measure was foreseen to be taken under the project by no later than December
1992 and followed in the wake of Government's broad policy of trade
liberalisation. Currently the sugar prices are determined freely by producers
based on market conditions. Distribution is also freely determined based on
market demand.
3.8 Consistent with the Government's import liberalisation policy, the controls on
sugar imports were also eased. Import licenses valid for six months are issued
by the Ministry of trade and Industry.
3.9  Another objective of the project was the dependence on expatriate staff be
reduced over time as a comprehensive program for training of Ugandan staff is
implemented. Accordingly, an international consulting firm (SOFRECO) was
employed to prepare and carry out a four year training program at an estimated
cost of US$ 1.6 million involving on the job training, training in institutes in
Uganda, and overseas training. Based on such training, a plan for
Ugandanisation of expatriate staff has been prepared, and is under
implementation.

4.0 Borrower's Performance
4.1 The implementation and operation experience has been satisfactory despite
several problems which were beyond borrower's control. However, several
measures to counter the shortcomings were undertaken, resulting in overall
achievement of project objectives. The key problem areas were in timely tying
up of loan agreements, opening of LCs, contractor delays in supplies and
adequate and timely recruitment of staff. In retrospect one can only state these
are normal problems in any project, and have been valuable in terms of building
up experience to handle future eventualities.
4.1 The KSW Management was alive to each of the problems, exhibited
considerable initiative and incurred timely additional expenditure to overcome
contractor's deficiencies by procuring short supplied items on urgent basis, and
fixing incentives and bonuses to contractors for timely completion. KSW
Management also directly coordinated affairs of sub-contractors under the Main
Contractor to ensure effective completion of pending jobs. The Company has
commenced repayment on the loans and has conformed in all respects to its
commitments under the Credit Agreements signed with the International
Financial Institutions and the Government of Uganda.
5.0 Evaluation of Bank/cofinanciers
5.1  There has been commendable cooperation between the Borrower and the Bank
and other cofinanciers. Despite several difficulties and delays, there was good
communication and interaction with the Bank officials, at the Headquarters and
the Resident Mission. This enabled quick resolution of problems.
...l9



-     9      -
5.2 The Bank through its officials demonstrated considerable flexibility in adapting
to Borrower's problems and requests which ultimately provided the basis for
mutual cooperation, leading to successful project execution.
5.3  As far as the procurement procedures of the Bank are concerned, it was felt that
these were not entirely suited to a private sector organisation. Especially the
lengthiness of procedures, and different stages and levels of processing and
approvals caused considerable delays. There may be a case for fine-tuning the
generalised procurement guidelines of the Bank to suit private sector projects.
5.4  Another important aspect of Bank-Borrower relationship is assuring continuity
of interface officials. This is necessary to establish smooth flow of activities and
consistency in approach to and methods of problem resolution. In this particular
case, continuity was ensured and substantially contributed to the positive
progress of activities on the project.

(a)  MOLASSES
Molasses generation will be 4 MT per 100 MT of  cane  crushed   or
annually 28,500 MT. Normally, about 12 to 15,000 MT of molasses can
be sold in a year. Additional molasses storage tank is being built.
It is proposed to construct and operate an ethanol plant within 2 years.
This is in line with the National Ethanol Programme now approved by
Government of Uganda for substitution of and blending with petrol upto
15 %.
(b)  BAGASSE
A steady state over 45,000 MT of bagasse will become available w hich
has to be disposed off. Currently it is envisaged that boilers in
neighbouring factories will utilise these quantities. However, a long term
solution is only through burning of bagasse in a cogeneration plant which
is envisaged as an integral part of the Outgrower's Expansion Scheme,
currently being studied under a grant from ADB funded study by an
International Consultancy Firm.
