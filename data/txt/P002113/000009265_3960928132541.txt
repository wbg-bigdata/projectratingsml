MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLE3M CORPORATION
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR THE OSO CONDENSATE FIELD DEVELOPMENT PROJFZT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) with the guarantee of
the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) for US$218 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms
with 19 years maturity, including a five-year grace period, at the variable
lending rate. In addition to the Bank loan to NNPC, the project would be
supported by an IFC loan of US$75 million to NNPC's joint venture partner,
Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN). The -roject would also be financed by
export credits (US$142 million equivalent), development banks (US$65
million equivalent), and commercial banks (US$95 million). In addition,
the sponsors would contribute US$290 million equivalent as equity inclusive
of US$100 million in foreign equity from MPN.
2.        Background.  With a production of over 550 million barrels of
crude oil in 1989 under OPEC arrangements, and exports of over 450 million
barrels, Nigeria has become one of the world's leading oil-exporting
countries. In addition, 27.5 mill'-on barrels of condensate are being
produced, currently classified outside OPEC quotas. To increase
sustainable oil production, NNPC and its joint-venture partners are
planning to enhance substantially, investment in exploration and
development operations. Even with increased levels of investment, only
modest increments in sustainable production are likely to be achieved over
the coming five years. As a result of poor economic policies in the 1970s,
and volatile oil markets, the country is currently faced with large
external and fiscal deficits. Oil exports account for about 90Z of
Nigeria's foreign exchange earnings.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Given Nigeria's current
economic and debt situation, it is difficult to attract external financing
for Nigeria, even for export-orientEd investments with high returns like
the Oso Project. By acting as a catalyst in putting together a financial
package involving international banks, export credit agencies, and foreign
equity, the Bank Group (IBRDlIFC) would, through its participation, trigger
the resumption of urgently needed financial flows into the country.
4.        Proiect Obiectives.  Through the development of the Oso
condensate field, the project aims to increase Nigerian hydrocarbon
exports, thereby enhancing significantly, the country's foreign exchange
earnings. In addition, the project would contribute to the institutional
strengthening of NNPC by assisting in establishing the first formal Joint
Operating Agreement for upstream oil operations in Nigeria, strengthening
NNPC's ability to market condensate, and reviewing NNPC's rolling five-year
corporate plans and commercialization program.



- 2 -
5.        Proiect Description.  The project will consist of the commercial
development of the Oso condensate field jointly owned in undivided
interests by NNPC (60Z) and MPN (40Z). The field is located in the
sponsors' Oil Mining Lease No. 70, situated 12 miles off-shore south-
eastern Nigeria. Recoverable reserves from the reservoir to be developed
under the project are estimated conservatively at 330 million barrels over
the 21-year life of the project, with a production profile of 100,000 bpd
during the first three to four years, and declining gradually thereafter.
Project implementation is about 3 years with production start up in mid-
1993. The facilities will consist of eight off-shore platforms for well-
heads, production facilities, gas compression and living quarters; 120
miles of sub-sea pipelines for condensate and gas; onshore condensate
storage and metering systems; and an offshore tanker loading facility for
condensate. The drilling program consists of 19 wells which include gas
reinjection and production wells.
6.        The total financing required for the project is estimated at
US$885 million equivalent, including a foreign exchange component of US$764
million (86?). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. NNPC and MPN are each seeking financing for their respective
shares of the project costs and their obligations are limited to these
shares. Loans to NNPC would be guaranteed by FGN and loans to MPN would be
on the basis of project financing.
7.        Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. Project implementation
began in mid-1990 and ongoing work is being financed by sponsors' equity,
which would be replenished to the extent eligible once project loans become
effective. Retroactive financing of up to 252 of the IBRD loan is
envisaged. This is required because a portion of the IBRD loan is
currently being pre-financed by NNPC's equity. This arrangement was
necessary to enable project implementation to start on July 1, 1990 with
the award of the Facilities Contract and, at the same time, to contend with
delays encountered in the complex task of raising commercial financing for
Nigeria. FasUure to award the Contract at that time would have resulted in
substantial cost increases and delays. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Nigeria are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A diagram showing the location
of the Oso field and a schematic of the project are attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 8245-UNI dated February 10, 1991, jointly prepared by
IBRD and IFC, is also attached.
8.        Agreed Actions.  The following agreements were reached:  (a)
NNPC would submit a plan for training its staff in marketing its share of
condensate; (b) NNPC would submit each year, updated estimates of Oso field
reserves; (c) any cost overruns or shortfalls in NNPC's share of financing
would be provided by FGN in the form of equity; (d) NNPC would furnish a
pricing formula for Oso condeneate for the calculation of margins, taxes
and royalties; and (e) production would be maintained at levels to generate
net revenues to at least cover NNPC's debt service obligations for the
Project. Conditions of Loan effectiveness are: finalization of the
finance plan; effectiveness of Japan Exim cofinancing; finalization of
loans to MPN; and signing of satisfactory purchase agreements for NNPC's
share of condensate production.

9.        Environmental Asoectss  No major issues are envisaged as a
direct result of project implementation. Project design includes measures
for protecting the environment in the event of mishap, including oil spills
and fire hazards. A detailed Environmental Impact Report, satisfactory to
the Bank, was prepared by the project sponsors. The field operator, MPN,
has an extensive history of environmentally safe operations covering 130
producing wells and 46 platforms off-shore Nigeria. Its Oil Spill
Contingency Plan is designed to deal effectively with the type of spills
which could be encountered in off-shore operations, under the worst-case"
scenarios of wind and water currents.
10.       Benefits.  Revenues from the project are expected to begin in
mid.1993. Net foreign exchange benefits to Nigeria are estimated at US$5.1
billion (1990 prices) of which US$3.1 billion will be generated during the
first six years of production. The economic rate of return (ERR) is 51S.
11.       Risks.  As with most field development projects, the actual
level of recover, and the timely completion of the project constitute the
main risks. An independent appraisal of recoverable reserves has been
carried out and its findings, more conservative than the sponsors'
estimates, have been factored in the financial and economic evaluatlons.
The returns remain highly satisfactory. To minimize the risk of delay,
project implementation will be managed by an experienced operator, MPN,
backed by Mobil Oil Company expertise and under the supervision of a joint
NNPClMobil task force. In addition, to facilitate coordination and
management, the main facilities are procured on a turnkey basis from an
experienced contractor.
12.       Another risk could be the volatility of oil prices.  Sensitivity
analysis indicates that unless oil prices were to fall below US$6/bbl,
operating expenses and debt service would not be affected. Prices have not
fallen to this level in the past decade.
13.       An additional risk stems from the possibility of Oso production
cutbacks in the event that Oso output is classified as crude oil by OPEC
and therefore is subject to OPEC quotas. This scenario has been examined
and it is concluded that, even if Oso is classified as crude, it could be
brought on production as proposed without Nigeria exceeding its OPEC
quotas.
14.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
