I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
By supporting the development of the Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network (IABIN), the
project development objective is to: (i) develop an Internet-based decentralized network to provide
access to scientifically credible biodiversity information currently existing in individual institutions and
agencies in the Americas, (ii) provide the tools necessary to draw knowledge from that wealth of
resources, which in turn will support sound decision-making concerning the conservation of biodiversity,
and (iii) provide a mechanism in the Americas to exchange information relevant to conservation and
sustainable use of biological diversity, thus promoting and facilitating technical and scientific
cooperations to fulfill the mandate of the Clearing-House Mechanism (CHM) of the Convention on
Biological Diversity.

The project will implement IABIN at a regional level through:

·        Assessing the information needs of the biodiversity community in the region and allowing the
         setting of priorities among those needs by the IABIN Council;
·        Concurring on a set of standards, protocols, tools, and methodologies that will enhance the
         ability to integrate information across the network;
·        Implementing tools to allow network-wide searching and retrieval of relevant biodiversity data,
         information, and knowledge including georeferenced data, quantitative and qualitative data,
         information, and knowledge;
·        Exchanging scientific expertise through collaborative projects and other efforts to build capacity
         in human and technological resources;
·        Engaging and training data providers in the implementation of the network;
·        Assessing the state of collections of North American specimens in Latin America and Europe
         and identifying non-electronic data of interest;
·        Producing value-added information such as studies and analyses;
·        Supporting the establishment and maintenance of national CHM nodes to help provide the
         clearing-house functions mandated in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and in
         subsequent Conference of the Parties (COP) decisions;
·        Digitizing relevant data held in non-electronic forms, thereby increasing the amount of
         biodiversity information accessible through the network.

The benefits are numerous. IABIN will:

·        Promote access to information useful to decision makers to improve biodiversity conservation

        and in other sectors, including socio-economic spheres of interest;
·       Improve regional cooperation for biodiversity management through sharing of experience and
        expertise;
·       Support the development of a common biodiversity conservation agenda for the region by
        facilitating the cross-fertilization of ideas;
·       Provide the capacity to address critical issues -- invasive species, migratory birds, amphibian
        declines, and the spread of diseases, among others -- at a regional level;
·       Allow the identification of gaps in knowledge and new fields of interest and facilitate
        consensus-building on a research agenda to support biodiversity conservation;
·       Improve the quality of biodiversity projects (both at preparation and during supervision) in the
        portfolio of the GEF, the World Bank, and other financiers;
·       Provide monitoring tools for protected areas and natural habitats.



I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project components will be fully defined and developed during project preparation and must also be
endorsed by the IABIN Council Meeting planned for August 2003. The following is a tentative
description
of the project components (see also Annex 1).

1. Consolidate and Maintain IABIN Hub and Internet-based portal. IABIN currently exists as an
inter-governmental agreement whose only physical presence is a virtual secretariat, staffed by
contributed personnel from the OAS and USGS. Under this component, the project will consolidate an
IABIN Hub with sufficient personnel and facilities to ensure a more tangible existence of IABIN. An
IABIN portal will also be built and maintained. Together with its members and partners, the Hub will
recommend to the IABIN Council the adoption of some basic principles of data sharing and intellectual
property rights which will underpin its future operations.

The bulk of the funding for this component will come from the GEF with counterpart funds from the
OAS and perhaps other cofinanciers. Funds will cover personnel, goods, and specialized consultancies.

2. Improve Interoperability among Networked Information Sources. Under this component, the project
will develop the standards and protocols essential to ensure compatibility between diverse data sources.
To the degree that standards exist (developed by NBII or GBIF for example) they may simply be adopted
after appropriate consultation (it is expected that many important protocols will be adopted during the
preparation phase). Other standards and protocols will need to be developed. Specialized tools and
toolkits will be developed to facilitate interoperability. Of particular importance for IABIN will be the
development of interoperability standards for a Catalogue and guidelines for data standards in selected
thematic areas (e.g., specimen data, ecosystem data, protected area information, etc.).

The GEF will provide $750,000 of funds which we expect to be matched by $3 million in funds from
partners collaborating in development of standards and specialized tools.

3. Facilitate Access to and Use of Network Content. Once standards and protocols exist and are adopted
by IABIN, an effort must be made to increase access to information and increase its usability. Under this
component, the Project will develop analytical tools to search for and analyze data so as to produce
useful information. Extensive work will be undertaken with data holders to provide them training and
assistance in converting existing data to IABIN-compatible standards. Particular emphasis will be given
to development of network content in priority thematic areas.

                                                        3
                                                                                                        ISDS




In financial terms this is expected to be the most important component of the project with $1.5 million in
GEF funds and with very significant co-financing of $7.0 million, primarily as cofinancing from recipient
organizations. It is expected that GEF funds under the component will be disbursed largely in previously
negotiated partnerships with lead organizations who will develop thematic networks and partially as a
small competitive fund for innovative projects in content creation.

4. Implement a Communications and Partnership Strategy. Development of inter-governmental and
inter-institutional relationships is critical to IABIN. This will be done through support to two IABIN
Council meetings during the lifetime of the project, negotiation of agreements with key organizations and
initiatives, promotion of CHM national focal points and IABIN focal points, and participation in other
global and regional biodiversity informatics initatives.

This component also includes significant training activities for member countries in biological
informatics. It will be financed by $500,000 in GEF funding and about $1 million in parallel financing.

5. Ensure Sustainability. A financial sustainability strategy already exists for IABIN but will be improved
and implemented during the project execution. A key element of this strategy is the creation of a fund for
IABIN under an independent IABIN Foundation. The project proposes providing $1 million of GEF
funds as seed funding for this fund to be matched by other donors.

6. Project Administration. Project execution will be the responsibility of OAS who have indicated they
are willing to provide significant cofinancing for project administration costs.
