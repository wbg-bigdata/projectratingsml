I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Energy Resources
1.01     Tunisia's presently known indigenous energy resources consist
principally of oil arnd associated and non-associated gas, in addition to some
lignitc, 65 MW of hydropower and about 250 MW of pumped storage potential.
Regarding renewable energy, Tunisia has a good solar regime and winds of fair
veloaity sweep the coastal areas for a considerable part of the year. In
addition, geotherimal springs and underground hot water resources are known to
exist in various locations.
1.02     Oil:  The proven recoverable oil regerves, located principally
onshore, are presently estimated to be about 70 miilion tons, out of total
proven and probable rceerves of about 80 million tons.  Output from the
existing two major jil fields (El Borma and Ashtart) is expected to decline,
but development of some small new fields is expected to increase total. output
from 5.0 million tons in 1982 to about 5.6 million tons in 1990.  However, the
decline in production from El Borma and Ashtart conbined with the rapid growth
in internal energy demand could render Tunisia a net oil importer by the end
of the decade (Annex 1.1).i/
1.03     Gas:  Tunisia's total associated and non-associated gas reserves
(proven, probable and possible) are estimated at about 93 billion cubic
meters 2' (80.5 million toe). In 1982, domestic production of associated
gas was about 0.49 million toe of which El Borma, exploited since the 1970's,
contributed about 80%. However, the gas from El Borma will be declining after
1984 and is expected to cease by the early l990s (Annex 1.2). The two main
proven offshore gas fields (Miskar and Jugurtha), which are presently
undeveloped, could yield 1.5 miltion toe per year once brought on stream.
There are other small offshore discoveries which require further drilling
before their reserves can be assessed. Onshore prospects have been identified
and their intensive exploration is underway. The timing of the development of
other gas fields is of critical importance and would have an important bearing
on the future energy balance of Tunisia (para. 1.15).!'
1.04     Starting in 1984 Tunisia will also have ar annual supply of natural
gas (about 0.2 million toe increasing to 0.4 million toe Dy 1987) received
free as a transit fee for Algerian gas transported to Italy, through the
1/  For more details on oil and gas resources, see Report No. 4137-TUN
"Tunisia Review of the VIth Development Plan", Vol. II, dated JuLne 29,
1983.
2/ Proven and probable reserves amount to about 77 billion cubic meters, and
possible reserves an additional 16 billion cubic me-ers.



transcontinental pipeline.-I  In addition, in early 1984, STEG signed a
three-year contract with Algeria to purchase additional gas. 2
1.05     Hydropower:  Tunisia's hydropower potential amounting to only 65 MW
has already been exploited (Annex 1.3).  The contribution of these plants to
the overall future demand for energy will amount to less than 1%. In
addition, a pumped storage plant of up to 250 MW could be developed in
conjunction with the Kasseb reservoir. Presently, however, this scheme is not
economically viable.
1.06     Coal and Geothermal:  Small deposits of poor quality lignite are
known to exist at Cap Bon, in the northeastern part of Tunisia. Exploitation
of these deposits is presently under study.  In addition, lignite deposits
(1.5 m thick) have been recently discovered at Sabria about 140 km southwest
oF the city of Gabes but presently no plans exist regarding the delineation of
these deposits. Hot water springs and underground hot water resources exist
at several locatiors in Tunisia but the extent of the geothermal potential has
not yet been determined. Tunisia is, however, considering initiating a study
for the preparation of a map and the ranking of its geothermal resources.
1.07     Renewable Energy Resources:  Tunisia has a good solar regime, with
insolation varying between 2,800 and 3,600 hours per year. To date, two
demonstration projects for the exploitation of solar energy have been
completed.  Although all the systems of both projects operate satisfactorily,
the cost per kWh generated is about three times the economic cost of energy
produced by alternati-'e conventional. generating plants.  Urtil the cost for
installing and operating such systems drops considerably, such projects will
not be economically viable for replication in Tunisia, except in very remote
and isolated areas where the subtransmission custs are forbiddingly high
(Annex 1.17). By contrast, the economic viability of solar water heaters has
already been established. STEG has estimated that by 1986, about 10,000 units
(manufactured locally) could be installed, provided a public information and
education campaign is undertaken, possibly accompanied by a credit scheme to
encourage purchasers.
1.08     Presently no data are available regarding the prospects of using
eolian energy in Tunisia. It is known, however, that winds of fair velocity
(about 30 km per hour) sweep the coastal areas for a considerable part of the
year. To assist Tunisia in collecting data regarding the eolian and solar
regimes of the country, the Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2197-TUN)
includes a component which would finance 20 wind and solar measuring
stations. In addition, a wind-driven pumping station financed by bilateral
1/  Tunisia has the option of receiving this gas in kind, or selling it to
Italy at a price equal to that of the Algerian gas.
2/  From April to September, 1984, 100 million m3; from October 1984 tM
September 1985, 250 million m3; and from October 1985 to September 1986,
a quantity to be determined.



aid has been installed at Hammam Biadha. Since the prospects for the use of
eolian energy seem to be good, a partly Government-owned enterprise, the
Societe d'Exploitation et de Recherche Petroliere Tunisienne (SEREPT), began
in mid-1983 developing a prototype multi-blade wind mill, and production would
start once the prototype has been successfully tested (Annex l.i7).
B. Sectoral Organization
1.09     Tunisia's energy sector is mana-ed by the Ministry of National
Economy through five directorates under the leadership of a Director General,
an energy planning unit, and a number of state-owned enterprises. In the oil
subsector, ETAP (Entreprise Tunisienne d'Activit6s P6troli6res), a
Government-owned enterprise, coordinates oil imports, oil exploration and
production activities; STIR (Societe Tunisienne des TndUstries de Raffinage),
also a Government-owned enterprise, operates the refinery, while SNDP (Soci6t6
Nationale de Distribution de Petrole), supplements the private firms in the
distribution of refined petroleum products with a market share of about 40%.
1.10     The Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du Gaz (STEG) is
responsible for the public supply of power, gathering, transporting and
distributing associated and non-associated gas, and manufacturing and
distributing town gas in the city of Tunis (para. 1.24). In addition to STEG,
several industries generate their own electricity and sell any surplus to
STEG.
C. Energy-Demand and Supply
Energy Balance
1.11     Historical Trends:  Tunisia is almost totally dependent on
hydrocarbons for meeting its commercial energy requirements (Annex 1.1). In
1982, oil comprised about 80% of the commercial energy consumed!'; natural
and manufactured gas comprised another 16%, and the remaining 4% was met by
hydro and imported hard coal and coke. In the period 1976-1982, when the
average real rate of growth of GDP was 5.3% per year, the growth of energy
consumption averaged 8.3% per year. This high rate of growth of energy
consumption, which is expected to continue through the decade, was primarily
due to: the low domestic prices of energy, the accelerated growth of the
industrial sector, especially such energy-intensive industries as building
materials, chemicals and refineries, and the low energy consumption per capita
(470 kgoe/capita compared to 1,130 kgoe/capita for Portugal).
1/ The petroleum products consumed had the following mix: LPG 5%; gasoline
7%; jet fuel 6%; kerosene 5%; gas oil (diesel) 39%; and fuel oil 38%.



- 4 -
1.12     Production of crude oil and gas increased from about 4.8 million toe
in 1976 to 5.5 million toe in 1982, while hydropower production averaged 12
thousand toe.  Up to the pcesent time Tunisia remains a net exporter of crude
oil (2.7 million tons in 1982) and the Government continues to depend on the
foreign exchange provided by these exports to sustain the growth of the
economy. However, because of the limited local refinery throughput
(1.5 million tons per year) and the growth in demand, Tunisia has continued to
import oil products.
1.13     Future Development:  The forecast of energy balances to year 1990
(Annex 1.1) is based on the following assumptions:
(i) CDP would increase at an average of about 4.5% a year over
1984-1986 and 5.0% a year over 1987-1990, a lower rate than the
5.3% annual growth experienced in 1976-1982;
(ii) gas would increasingly displace cil. mainly because the known
domestic oil reserves are insufficient to maintain the present
level of production beyond the early 199C's;
(iii)  the effect of the implementation of measures to ensure
conservation, substLtution and utilization of renewable encrgy
resources would take a while to materialize; and
(iv)  extension of electricity service to about 71% of the popuLaition by
1988.'`
Based on the above assumptions, gross consumption of energy in the period
1982-1990 is forecast to increase at an average annual growth rate of 9.2%
(from 3 million toe to 6 million toe).
1.14     Natural gas is expected to play a major role in meeting Tunisia's
future energy requirements.  In addition to the gas received sS a transit fee,
the Government has several options for meeting tie future energy demand of the
country. These options include the development of the proven potential gas
fields (e.g., E1 Franig, Miskar, Jugurtha) which would require heavy capital
investment, and the purchase of gas from Algeria by tapping the
tianscontinental pipeline (para. I.04).  Presently tlhe Government is examining
the available options, and is expected to make a decision by late 1984.
1.15     In the absence of a decision to develop new gas fields, Tunisia's
domestic energy balance is expected to deteriorate, with the export surplus
declining from about 2.6 million toe in 1982 to about 0.1 million toe in
1990.
1/ In 1977 electricity service was provided to about 40% of the population
(Annex 1.7).

Energy Planning and Conservation
1.16     The Government's energy pricing policy, including reduction of
petroleum product and electricity subsidies (pares. 1.21-1.24), is expected to
influence energy demand and lead to energy conservationi. In addition, with
bilateral assistance from USALD the Government has undertaken energy
conservdtion and data coll.ection stuidies. A number of independent studies
focusing on the six major energy consuming sectors of the eccaumy (industry,
agriculture, transportation, households, commerce .-nd public services) are
underway. These studies aim at identifying opportunities for energy
conservation, and would be used to outline several scenarios for developing
and managin'3 the energy sector. The Government is expected to review its
energy policy in the light of the results of theae studies.
Trends in the Production and Consumption of Electrical Energy
1.17     Historical Trends:  Since its incorporation (1962) STEG was faced
with a high growth rate of demand which in some years (1978 and 1979) reached
as high as 17% per year. Between 1962 and 1981 demand grew at an average rate
of about 12% per year. To meet the demand, STEG, starting in 1970, embarked
ora a systematic expansion of the newly integrated national system, and by
1981, its installed generacing capacity was increased about eight-fold (from
116 to 900 MW), the production of electricity nine-fold (from 288 to 3,125
GWh) and the number of customers four-fold (frum 200,000 to 758,000), while
distribution lossee where reduced from 18% to 14% (Annexes 1.3 to 1.7).
, 1.8    STCEG prepares its least cost expansion program subject to a capital
constraint. Consequently, STEG's investment decisions were, and continue to
be, dictated by its ability to finance this program. Because of the
Government's reluctance to increase electricity tariffs significantly in real
termaJ/, STEG was led to make investment decisions, which at times, deviated
from the least cost expansion path that STEG would have followed in the
absence of a capital constraint. Thus, in the period 1977-1978, STEG
installed an additional capacity of 150 MW combustion turbines (CT) deferring
until 1980 the construction of a steam power plant, although construction of
such a steam power plant woiuld have been justified on technical and economic
grounds five to seven years earlier, had the financial resources been
available. STEG is presently implementing a least cost investment program.
1.19     In 1982, GD? grew by about 1% compared to the historic rate of about
5.3%, reflecting the international recession as well as poor agricultural
output. Consequently, peak demand and net generation grew by only 7% and 4%
respectively, largely reflecting a drop irn the growth of demand from major
high voltage consumers. Other factors which also contributed to the unusual
decline in the growth of demand were the unexpected plant breakdown and
advancement of waintenance programs in some large energy intensive industrial
complexes (steel p!.ant, phosphate mines and cement plants). During the same
1/ Between 1970-1981 electricity tariffs were increased on the average by
L.7% per year in real terms.



yea-, medium and high-voltage consumers accounted for 72% (2,014 GWh) of
STEG's total sales, while low-voltage consumers accounted for the balance of
28% (790 GWh). Of the 820,000 low-voltage consumers, about 80% were
domestic 1/, 18% small commercial, industrial and public lighting, and the
remaining 2% irrigation pumping. Of the domestic consumers, 84% lived in
urbani areas, and the remaining 16% in rural conglomerations and rural
dispersed areas.
1.20     Future Development:  Within the context of the five-year (1982-1986)
Sixth National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP) and considering
the slowdown L2 economic growth experieniced in 1982, STEG adjusted the 1983
demnand projections to accoullt for the unprecedented industrial plant
breakdown, and revised downwards its 1984-1991 load forecast (Annex 1.8).
STEG forecasts that in 1983 peak demand would grow by about 17%, net
generation and sales by about 12%, and the number of customers by about 8%.
For the remaining part of the Sixth NESDP (1984-1986), STEG projects that
demand would continue to grow at a somewhat lower than the historic rate (11%
compared to 12%), while demand is expected to slow down to an average rate of
about 9% for the Seventh NESDP (1987-1991). STEG -- being aware of the
inherent uncertanties involved in demand forecasting -- plans its generation
expansion program in sequential phases and revises its load forecast at least
once a year. Thus, if STEG's 1984 review of the load forecast indicates that
demand would not grow as currently forecast, investment in excess generating
capacity could be avoided by postponing construction of the Rades (B) power
plant by one year (para. 1.30). Tunisia's projected GDP growth for the Sixth
and Seventh NESDP, and STEG's load forecast were reviewed by the Bank and were
found acceptable.
D. Energy Pricing
1.21     Petroleum Products:  Up until 1980, domestic prices of petroleum
products were either maintained unchanged or increased at a lower rate than
the price surge which occurred in the international market. The pricing
policy followed prior to 1980 had the effect of encouraging the creation of
energy intensive industries, and made investment in energy conservation
schemes unattractive. Starting in 1981, the Government, realizing that this
pricing policy could no longer be sustained, introduced successive and at
times drastic increases in the prices of petroleum products (Annex 1.9), and
started investigating the potential for energy conservation (para. 1.16).
Under Loans 1864-TUN and 2003-TUN the Government agreed to raise prices of
petroleum products to international levels by end-1986. This covenant is
slightly modified in the proposed loan to reflect the fact that domestic
consumer prices for some petroleum products, such as gasoline, already exceed
international levels. The increases introduced to date are in line with this
timetable. While in 1980 the overall subsidies (net of taxes) on petroleum
products amounted to about US$127 million, in 1982 the net amount of subsidies
1/ Including water heaters (metered separately) which account for about 5%.



- 7  -
on retail petroleum produc:ts had been reduced to about US$64 million.-/
Domestic retail prices of LP(, Kerosene, gas oil and fuel oil. ranged from 6W
to 95% of border prices in 1983, while gasoline was priced at about 180% of
the border price.  On a weiglhted averaige basLs, domeiestc consumer prices for
petroleum products are about 90% of internatLollal prLces (Annex 1.10).
1.22     Electricity PrLcing:  For Iiigh anct medium voltage customers, rates
are based on time of day (peak/off peak).  For low voltage customers, seven
different classes of rates are applicable: domestic, space heating, small
industrial users, and grain mills, each having a flat rate; agriculture water
pumping and water heating, each having an off-peak rate: atud public lighting,
which lhas a declining block tariff (Anrnex 1.11). At present STEG's average
electricity rate is only slightly below (92%) the reLated economic cost of
supply (Annex 1.12). Subsidies remain significant for hiigh voltage consumers
only, for which tariffs are estimated to be about 74% of the long runl marginal
coBt (LRMC).2/  Industries, which accounted for about 67% of electricity
sales in 1982, have previously not been encouraged to make efficient use of
energy nor to invest in energy conservation. Electricity subsidies were made
possible in part, by STEG benefitting from relatively low fuel prices and the
supply of El Borma gas almost free to be used for power generation. The
Govern-w-nt, however, is moving awa;- from its past policy of promoting
industrLal and commercial development through cheap energy.
1.23      Consistent with this new pricing policy, STEG and thie Government
reached an understanding with the Bank during negotiations .hat the structure
of electricity rates would increasingly reflect the economic cost of supp: of
differenit voltage levels. The following calendar, or such other dates
acceptable to '.he Bank, would be followed. By November 30, 1984, STEG and the
Bank would agree on a methodology for calculating LRMC, and determine the
terms of reference for a study which would: (a) compare actual rates with the
LRMC and (b) analyze the impact of bringing rates in line with the LRMC.  The
study, including conclusions arid recommendations, would be furnished to the
Bank by April 30, 1985, for review and comment. STEG, the Government, and the
Bank would agree by September 30, 1985 on an iction plan implementing the
recommeendattons of the study, which the Government and STEG would subsequently
follow.
1.24     The Government's intention to remove the subsidies on petroleur;
products (para. 1.21), combined with the foreseen depletion of the El Borrna
gas and STEG's expansion program, will result in an increased need to
substantially raise STEG's tariffs in the years to come (paras 3.25-3.27).
This might be mitigated by the possible substitution of less costly fuels such
as coal for fuel oil, and gas for diesel oil, to enable STEG to reduce its
operating costs. In order to assist Tunisia in achieving the substitution of
gas for diesel oil, the Bank under Loan L864-TUN has financed the construction
of gas pipelines. The option of substituting coal for fuel oil is currently
under study, but is not expected to be implemented before the 1990's at the
earliest.
1/ The estimate of subsidies on petroleum products in 1980 is based on FOB
prices, whereas the estimate for 1982 is calculated on the basis of CIF
port of Tunis prices.
2/  In 1983, low and medium-voltage tariffs were about 102% and 93%, of their
corresponding LRMC.

E. The Beneficiary: STEG
1.25     STEG is a public enterprise incorporated in 1962.  Its organization
chart is given in Annex 1.13. Operations are managed from "he Head Office in
Tunis. For administrative and operational purposes, the country is divided
into 27 Districts with their managers reporting to six regional managers who
in turn report to the Deputy General Manager (Annexes 1.14 and 1.15). The
head of'ice staff provides technical support to the districts, and supervises
and coordinates their activities. The districts are responsible for:
operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of the system in their jurisdiction,
customer relations, warehousing, transport, surveys and preparation of
detailed engineering of new distribution projects, supervision of contractors,
and data collection and planning for future expansion of their local systems.
1.26     Although STEG's present organization is adequate for the fulfillment
of its tasks, further decentralization appears to be necessary. However, more
training of the regional administrative and accounting staff would be needed
in order to render such further decentralization effective. STEG is aware of
this need and is beginning to take satisfactory steps in training the required
staff.
Existing Facilities and Equipment
1.27     STEG currently operates four steam power plants (548 MW), five hydro
plants (65 MW), nine simple cycle combustion turbine plants (489 MW) and some
small diesel plants amounting to a total of 4 MW. Most of this capacity has
been added since 1970, when STEG launched an ambitious expansion of the
interconnected system. Except for some of the diesel stations located in
isolated areas, the generating stations are interconnected (see Annex 1,3 and
IBRD Map No. 17421).
1.28     The main transmission system operates at 225-kV, with a 225-kV ring
around Tunis, and 150-kV and 90-kV lines to serve the rest of the system. The
total length of this system is about 2,370 km. The length of medium-voltage
lines (10, 15 and 30 kV) is about 13,800 km, and low voltage lines and cables
(220-V and l00-V) are about 16,600 km long (see Annex 1.7 and IBRD Map
No. 17421).
Development Piogram
1.29     To meet the forecast demand for electricity, STEG has formulated an
ambitious investment program for 1983-1988, estimated to cost about US$930
million in current prices, or US$540 million in 1983 prices. Although this
program is 35% larger in constant dollar terms than the investment program
which STEG achieved in 1976-1982, it is considered to be within STEG's
technical implementation capacity. The 1983-1988 investment program is
summarized below.
1.30     Expaxision of the generating facilities involves:  (a) installation of
5x32 MW of simple cycle CTs commissioned in 1983 at a cost of



- 9 -
US$60 million1'; and (b) erection in two phases (A and B) of a 4x160-MW
steam power plant at Rades (boilers suitable for firing with fuel oil, gas or
coal). Phase (A) of the Rades plant (2x160-MW) is to be comwissioned in 1985,
and phase (B), consisting of the remaining units (2x160-MW), is currently
scheduled for commissioning in 1988/89. All except one of the 5x32-MW CTs
would be fired with gas ("royalty gas" received from the intercontinental gas
pipeline), and in 1984 would displace the old CTs operating on diesel oil.
They would also assist in xieeting the demand after the old units of Goulette I
are retired and until the first unit of Rades (A) is commissioned.
Thereafter, they would replace some of the older CTs that would be retired.
1.31     Extension and reinforcement of the transmissiot system consists of;
(a) construction of 5 km of 150-kV line, reinforcement of a 30-kV line, and
erection of a 225/30-kV substation, to be completed in late 1983; (b)
construction of 2 double-circuit 225-kV lines to complete the 225-kV loop
around Tunis, and connection of the island of Kerkennah to the national grid
through two submarine cables, to be completed by 1985; and (c) construction of
a dispatching center, reinforcement of existing 90/30-kV transformer stations,
and the construction of new 225/30-kV and 150/30-kV transformer stations by
1988. With the exception of the d5spatching center, the scope of the last two
projects is not yet well defined.
1.32     Extension and reinforcement of the distribution system consists of:
(a) rural electrification; (b) rehabilitation and extension of the urban
distribution systems; and (c) extension of medium voltage system to supply new
industries. The 1983-1988 rural electrification program aims at the reduction
of migration of rural inhabitants to urban areas by creating jobs, stimulating
small industry and electric water pumping, and improving living conditions in
rural areas. The objective is to increase the level of access to electricity
service in rural agglomerations2' from 37% in 1982 to 67% by 1988
(Annex 1.7). The Government, realizing the financial burden imposed on STEG
by the electrification of many villages within a short period, has agreed to
contribute about 60% of the total cost associated with the electrification of
rural Tunisia. The rehabilitation of the urban networks constitutes a
necessary measure that STEG has to take in order to improve the quality of
service it provides, and its revenues by reducing in stages the present
distribution losses-', and to reach 100% electrification level in urban
areas.
1/ This estimate includes substations associated with the plants, spares for
at least 3 yea2s of operation, and training of 5 engineers and 15
technicians.
2/  An agglomeration is defined b) the Tunisian Government as a cluster of not
less than 10 solid wall (brick) houses with a maximum distance of 100
meters between any two adjacent structures.
3/  First stage started under Loan 2003-TtN.  The second stage aims at
reducing losses from 14.2% to 13.2% by 1988.

Manpower and Training
1.33     Manpower:  At the end of 1982 STEG's total number of regular staff
was 6,689 of which 1,118 were professional, 4,059 skilled technical and
administrative, and 1,512 unskilled. This staff is considered adequate and
capable of conducting STEG's current activities. STEG's progress in developing
adequate technical staff is illustrated by the growing practice of lending
STEG staff to utilities in Arab and French-speaking African countries.
Presently 320 STEG staff are on secondment, primarily in Libya and Saudi
Arabia. Reabsorption of these individuals when they return to STEC might
create overstaffing problems. To avoid such an eventuality, STEG will need to
control recruitment of new employees and plan well in advance the use of
returning seconded staff. Productivity of STEG's staff has been improving.
In 1982, the ratio of energy sold per employee was 356 MWh/employee, 11.3% up
front the 1979 level of 320 MWh/employee.
1.34     Training:  At present the output of the National Polytechnic
Institute (Ecole Nationale d'Ingenieurs) is adequate to cover STEG's needs in
engineers and those of the rest of the economy. In addition, the corporation
constructed in 1976 a training center staffed with 70 instructors of which 30
are permanent training staff. The center offers basic training courses to
middle level technical and administrative personnel, and seminars and
upgrading courses. STEG's 1983-1988 development program includes a training
component which consists of: (a) extension of the training center by
const.ucting 3 new dormitories and the allied classrooms and other facilities;
(b) construction of a laboratory for tests and measurements; and (c) erection
of a full size medium voltage network for training of personnel on live
lines. Some equipment and tools used in the training center and training of
staff abroad is being financed under Loan 2003-TUN. The proposed Project also
contains a training component (para. 2.04).
F. The Past and Future Involvement of the
Bank in the Energy Sector
1.35     The Bank's involvement in the sector started in 1971, with a loan to
STEG of US$7.5 million (Loan 724-TUN) to finance the El Borma gas pipeline.
The Project was successfully completed and met both its technical and
institutional objectives. A second loan of US$12 million (Loan 815-TUN) was
made to STEG in 1972 to finance 2x20-MW CTs, transmission and distribution
system expansion, and consutlting services for future plant and institutional
development. A Project Performance Audit Report written in 1979, concluded
that the Project assisted STEG in building its technical experience, and led
to the introduction of a more rational tariff structure. One of the lessons
learned was the importance of the Bank reviewing more carefully the
assumptions for demand forecasts (demand at the time of the first power
project was underestimated). A third loan of US$14.5 million (Loan 1355-TUN)
was made to STEG in 1977 to finance the installation of 7x21-MW CTs. The
Project Completion Report dated April 22, 1983, concluded that greater



- 11 -
provision for spare parts should have been made given the severe dispatching
schedule under which the units would be operating. A fourth loan of US$37.0
million (Loan 1864-TUN) was made to STEG in 1980 to finance the first phase of
a gas pipeline for the distribution of royalty gas from the intercontinental
pipeline to the major consumption centers in Tunisia. The next Bank loan of
US$41.5 million (Loan 2003-TUN) was made to STEG in 1981 to finance the first
three years (1982-1984) of STEG's five-year (1982-1986) distribution program.
Although disbursements under this Project were delayed due to the need to
revise the procurement documents in accordance with Bank guidelines, the
Project is currently being implemented satisfactorily and is not facing any
particular problems. Finally a loan of US$4.5 million (Loan 2197-TUN) was
made to the Government in 1982 for Technical Assistance, including a number of
activities in the energy sector (energy audits of wajor industries; assessment
of geothermal resources; planning for handling petroleum products; power
system planning; and assessment of wind and solar energy potential).
Implementation of the energy component of this loan has proceeded slowly.
However, institutional issues which hindered progress have been resolved and
satisfactory progress for this component is anticipated in the near future.
1.36     The Bank's continued involvement in the power subsector has
contributed in strengthening several aspects of STEG's operations and
management.  STEG's technical capabilities and practices have reached levels
that are almost comparable to those of similar institutions in developed
countries. In addition, STEG has been able to achieve a high level of
self-financing, and a satisfactory financial position until the last two years
(1981 and 1982). STEG's financial performance could be weakened, however, if
the Government does not assist STEG with taking steps covenanted under
existing loans. The continuation of the Bank's involvement in the energy
sector by lending for oil, gas and electricity would strengthen the existing
institution building efforts, improve technical standards and achieve overall
coordination of energy pricing. It would also provide the opportunity for the
Bank to participate in guiding the growth of the energy sector along a
least-cost investment path, in assisting Tunisia in the transition to become a
net energy importer, while working with the Tunisian Government to postpone
this transition through improved energy conservation measures.
II. THE PROJECT
2.01     The Setting:  In 1982 Tunisia's population was 6.7 million (1,204,000
families) of which 55% lived in urban areas, 21 in rural agglomerations and
the remaining 24% in dispersed rural areas.  Between 1977 and 1982, STEG's low
voltage consuners increased an average of 65,000 annually of which, about 87%
were domestic. Thus, by the end of 1982, the level of publically supplied
electricity service was: urban 94%; rural agglomerations 37%; rural dispersed
16%; and country as a whole 60%.  The Government's objective is to increase,
by 1988, the level of electricity service to rural agglomerations to 67% and
to extend electricity service to almost all inhabitants living in large urban
centers.



- 12 -
2.02     Between 1977 and 1982, urban population increased by 6.22 per year
and associated consumption of low voltage consumers by an average of 12% per
year. This high rate of population and consumption growth exceeded STEG's
forecast, and consequently funds allocated in its budget for the reinforcement
and extension of the distribution network were inadequate to provide the
required equipment and materials needed to ensure reasonable quality of
service. This shortfall, coupled with the higher priority given to generation
and transmission, has rendered the urban distribution system inadequate to
cope with the demand. On average, the voltage drop in the urban areas is
double the maximum acceptable level (20% as compared to 10%), and in certain
lines it reaches as high as 40%. Rehabilitation of the distribution system is
expected to progressively reduce distribution losses by about 40  (from 14% in
1982 to 8%) over a period of about 15 years. In addition, power failures in
most urban load centers are the rule rather than the exception. This low
quality of service and the substantial energy losses incurred by STEG have
forced the corporation to give top priority to a rehabilitation program of the
urban distribution systems.
2.03     Objectives:  The Project is a continuation of the Third Power Project
(Loan 2003-TUN) and when completed would extend electricity service to the
beneficiaries at least cost by implementing a three-year time slice
(1985-1987) of the long-term prc,,ram for rural electrification, reducing
system losses in urban areas, improving operating efficiency of the system,
and continuing the Bank's efforts in assisting STEG to expand its training
program. In addition, the proposed Project would follow up on the efforts
started under previous Bank loans (1864-TUN and 2003-TUN) in rationalizing
energy pricing. To achieve operating efficiency improvements and system loss
reduction, STEG agreed to undertake a set of actions and monitor progress
achieved through a list of key performance indicators.  In addition, STEG
agreed to furnish to the Bank for review by March 31 of each year a report,
including the agreed monitoring indicators (Annex 1.16).
2.04     Project Description, Scope, Beneficiaries and Location:  The Project
consists of three components: (a) rural electrification; (b) urban
rehabilitation; and (c) the provision of equipment, tools, and training. The
rural electrification component would affect 15 Governorates by extending
electricity service to about 35,000 new domestic customers -', 1,500 pumping
stations 2i, and 50 commercial and small industrial consumers 3'.  It
1/  The 1979-1980 survey indicated 27,900 existing customers.  Assuming that
the historic growth rate would be maintained, the number of customers
would grow to about 35,000 by 1985.
2/  The 1979-1980 survey indicated that there were 1,400 pumping stations.  By
1985 these stations are expected to increase to about 1,500.
3/  Of the 18 Governorates, the Governorates of Gafsa, Gabes and Medenine are
not included in the proposed Project, because their electrification is
implemented under a loan secured from the Banque Africaine de
Developpement (BAD).

involves the supply, construction and erection of about: 1,400 km of medium
voltage lines; 1,600 km of low voltage lines; and 25 MVA of distribution
transformer capacity (Annex 2.1). The cost of material and installation of
public (street) lighting is borne by the budget of the Governorates and is
therefore excluded from the Project. The urban rehabilitation component would
encompass the entire country, and would improve the quality of service to more
than 130,000 existing customers b, rehabilitating the distribution systems of
about 60 cities and large towns. It involves the supply, construction and
erection of about: 1,100 km of medium voltage lines; 1,000 km of low voltage
lines; and 400 distribution transformers with an estimated total capacity of
about 40 MVA (Annex 2.2). The third component would provide the necessary
construction and erection equipment, and vehicles for the realization of the
second component, testing equipment, tools and training (about 70 persons for
a total of about 120 man-months, estimated at a cost of $3,500/man-month)
which would assist STEG in improving its technical capabilities. STEG agreed
to furnish to the Bank for its review by November 30 of each year an outline
of the following year's training program in such detail as the Bank shall
reasonably request.
2.05     Project Cost Estimates:  The estimated cost of the Project is set out
in Annexes 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 and summarized in Table 2.1. The Project base
cost estimates are expressed in terms of anticipated end-1983 prices. These
estimates were prepared by STEG and reviewed by the Bank and found
reasonable.

due to the dispersion of the Project area. ]No physical contingencies vere
estimated for the third component of the Project (other equipment, tools aad

2. Price contingencies for the local cost components have been calculated at 9%
in 1984, and 8% p.a. for 1985-1988. Price contingencies for the foreign cost
components have been calculated at 7.5% for 1984, 7.0% for 1985, and 6.0% for
1986-1988. Thus, local price contingencies are about 24%, and foreign price
contingencies are about 182 of the respective base costs plus physical
contingencies.
3.  Identifiable taxes and duties are about TD 4.4 million (US$6.5 million
equivalent) and the total project cost, net of taxes, is TD 51.2 million
(US$76.5 million equivalent).
4. Bank loan assumed US038.7 million (including capitalized front-end fee).

2.06     Project Financing:  The proposed loan of US$38.7 million would
finence 46% of the total Project cost (L00% of the foreign exchange cost,
incLuding front-end fee). Local costs would be met by customers'
contributions, STEG's internal cash generation, and Government's contribution
towards the cost of rural electrification.  The proposed financing plan of the
project is summarized in Table 2.2.

2.07     Status of Project Preparation:  During 1979-1960 and in anticipation
of the Sixth NESDP, STEG through its district offices, surveyed more than
2,000 villages and compiled information pertinent to the electrification of
each of those villages. On the basis of this information and following the
methodology used by TECSULT rnternational Limited (Canadian consultants) who
prepared a rural electrification study for the Fifth NESDP, and suggestions
made by the Bank, STEG has prepared a program for the development of the rural
distribution system. This program is updated on an annual basis and revised
whenever deemed necessary"'. The methodology used for the formulation of
the program has been reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory. The
resulting rural electrification program represents the least-cost scheme for
expanding the distribution system simultaneously in all Governorates and
provide electricity service to the beneficiaries. The Third Power Project and
the proposed Project have been derived from this program.
2.08     Since the Government is financing about 60% of the rural
electrification component of the proposed Project, it has insisted that STEG
include a certain number of villages (33 out of a total of 704) in the
proposed Project which although not justified on purely economic basis (para.
4.04), would be included because they have been deemed pockets of poverty
hitherto deprived of social services and infrastructure. However, in order to
maintain the viability of the Project, the number of economically
unjustifiable villages was restricted by setting an upper limit to the average
cost per connection, in each Governorate, of 700 TD (US$1,045) in end-1983
prices.
1/ For the preparation of the proposed project, the program was revised on
the basis of updated data and prices prevailing in July 1982.



- 16 -
2.09     The physical quantities of equipmellt and materials required
(Annex 2.1) and the costs associated with the implementation of the rural
electrification component of the Project, were derived from the information
collected by STEG (para. 2.07). In the case of the urban rehabilitation
component, a representative sample of 10 lines situated in each District was
selected. Measurements were performed on the sample lines and their average
values were used to estimate the physical quantities of materials (Annex 2.2)
and associated costs for implementing the rehabilitation component.  Finally,
on the basis of the available stock and the volume of works inivolved in the
second component of the Project, the necessary construction and erection
equipment, vehicles and tools were determined by STEG. The figures were
reviewed by the Bank and found reasonable.
2.10     Engineering:  The distribution equipment and materials used by STEG,
as well as typical construction designs of distribution facilities are
standardized. Consequently, technical specifications for the equipment and
materials needed to implement the Project are already available. The basic
bidding documents for the supply of materials and equipment were reviewed by
the Bank under Loan 2003-TUN. The documents to be used for goods procured
under the proposed loan would be ready by July 1984. STEG's District offices,
supported by the Head Office, have already started detailed Project design
including topographic sursey.  In view of the volume of works involved, this
task would continue to end-1986 (see I.mplementation Schedule, Annex 2.6). The
detailed design relating to the portion of the Project to be implemented in
1985, would be completed by July 1984.
2.11     Project Implementation:  Implementation of the Project would occur
over four and one-half years (1984 to mid-1988), including the preparation in
1984 of detailed design and tender documents for the procurement of goods and
works required during the first year of construction. Installation and
erection of Project facilities would start in January 1985, and are expected
to be completed by June 1988. Although STEG is able to implement the proposed
project in parallel with the extension of the urban distribution system, in
order to ensure timely implementation, STXiG agreed to submit by November 30 of
each year for Bank approval the list of villages to be supplied with
electricity service during the following year. Upon commissioning, all
facilities would be owned, operated and maintained by STEG.
2.12     Construction Supervision:  STEG would be responsible for the
execution of the entire Project. To that end it would prepare detailed
Project implementation schedules, supervise installation and erection of
Project facilities and handling of equipment and materials, and monitor
implementation progress. In addition, STEG agreed to prepare and submit to
the Bank quarterly progress reports and a Project Completion Report.
2.13     Procurement:  Contracts financed under the proposed loan for the
supply of equipment and materials, construction and erection equipment,
testing eq-uipment, and tools, grouped to the extent possible, would be awarded
through international competitive bidding (ICB) (para. 2.15). Local
manufacturers are expected to bid for about 40% of the distribution equipment



- 17 -
and materials. For purposes of bid comparison, a preference limited to 15% of
the CIF price of imported goods, or the customs duty, whichever La lower,
would be extended to responsive local manufacturers. Standard distribution
equipment and materials, testing equipment, and tools, also financed under the
proposed loan, not exceeding US$200,000 per contract and in the aggregate not
exceeding the equivalent of US$700,000, would be procured in accordance with
limited international tendering (LIT) by inviting quotations from at least
three suppliers from eligible countries. STEG will. make procurements through
ICB and LIT in accordance with the current Guidelines for Procurement under
World Bank loans. The tendering documents for the supply of goods exceeding
in value the equivalent of US$500,000 to be financed by the Bank would be
approved by the Bank before tenders are issued.
2.14     Meters and poles will not be financed under the proposed loan, and
will be purchased locally through directly negotiated contracts. The proceeds
of the proposed loan will also not be used to finance installation, erection,
and civil works related to the Project. In the case of the rural
electrification component, these works will be procured, depending on the
value of the contract, either through local competitive bidding (LCB), or
direct negotiation under procedures which the Bank reviewed and found
satisfactory. The installation and erection of the facilities of the urban
component which involve work on live linLes would be undertaken by STEG, whtile
new extensions of the urban system would be procured through LCB. Due to the
geographical dispersion of the areas affected by the Project, individual
construction and erection contracts would be small (not expected to exceed
US$100,000) and it was therefore considered unlikely that foreign contractors
would be interested in bidding for these contracts.
2.15     The allocations proposed above show that out of the total investment
cost of US$82.9 million (excluding the front-end fee of US$o.1 million),
procurement through ICB would account for US$49.5 million, through LIT
US$70-,000, and through LCB US$12.6 million. The financing by the Bank of
these procurement items would be US$37.7 million under ICB, US$500,000 under
LIT, US$400,000 for training, and no Bank funds would finance LCB. The
proposed procurement plans are summarized below:

2.16     In the interest of economy and efficiency, STEG procures its yearly
needs of distribution equipment and materials once a year. By September of
each year, bids are obtained for goods to be used during the following year.
After award of contracts, and not later than December, STEG makes use of its
option to revise the ordered quantities, valued at the agreed unit prices in
the contract. In view of the soundness of this approach, procurement of
equipment and materials for the electrical plant, and tools to be used in the
Project will follow the same procedures. Materials to be used during the
first year of Project implementation would be drawn from STEG's inventory and
replaced by materials procured under the proposed loan.
2.17     Disbursement:  Disbursements from the proceeds of the proposed Bank
loan would be made for: (a) 100% of the foreign expenditures of direct
imports, and 80% of local expenditures of locally manufactured or purchased
equipment and materials (for the electrical plant, construction and erection
equipment, testing equipment, and tools); (b) 100% of the foreign cost of
training; and (c) the front-end fee on the Bank loan. The closing date would
be December 31, 1988, six months after the estimated completion of the
Project, to allow for payment of retention monies. The expected disbursement
schedule and disbursement profiles are given in Annexes 2.7 and 2.8.
Procurement of materials to be financed under the proposed Project would be
undertaken on a yearly basis, and disbursement is expected to follow the trend
ov the Bank-wide sector disbursement profile. If surplus Bank funds are
available as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates, such amounts would be



- 19 -
cancelled from the loan; if excess funds arise for any other reason, the Bank
would still seek to disburse the loan fully, for example throtugh a revLsion in
Project definition if appropriate.
2.18     Retroactive Financing and Advanced Contracting:  No retroactive
financing or advance contracting is involved in the proposed Project.
2.19     Environmental Aspeh..cs:  The Project would have no adverse
environmental impact. Possible adverse aesthetic effects would be kept to a
minimum by suitable routing of overhead lines.
2.20     Risks:  No special risks are foreseen, and no major implementatiou
problems are expected.  However, since 60; of the funds required to implemetLt
the rural electrification component would iepend upon Government allocations,
in order to avoid overstocking of Bank-fin-incad equipment and ensure that
purchase of equipment and materials for the, proposed Project proceeds at a
pace consistent with Government's allocations and Project implementation, STEG
agreed to submit by November 30 of each year for Bank approval the financing
plan associated with the implementatiou of the Rural Component of the Project
during the following year.
III. FINANCE
A. Overview
3.01     Recently STEG's financial position has been weakened by irregularity
in the timing of electricity rate (tariff) increases. No rate increase
occurred between October 1982 and June 1984, notwithstanding the increase in
STEG's investment program in that period. Historically however, STEG can be
credited with having maintained a high level of self-financing, averaging
about 40% of capital expenditures over the six years prior to 1983 (para.
3.04). While STEG's capital structure to date shows a relatively low reliance
on Government-supplied equity (with capital increases financing on average
less than 10% of investments), in the future STEG's inivestment program could
create an increasing burden for the national budget, in the event that the
Government ia reluctant to approve rate increases to compensate adequately for
fuel and other cost increases. The company faces other financial and
administrative problems, such as: a tight debt service situation aggravated by
depreciation of the Dinar vis-a-vis the U.S. Dollar, uneven collection of
receLvables from public customers, and delays in preparing annual financial
statements. These issues and appropriate recommendations are discL;ssed in
more detail beLow.
3.02     Separate financial data for STEG's gas and electricity operations is
not presently available; therefore, financial ratios used in this analysis
refer to the performance of the company in its entirety. STEG is in the
process of designing a system for separating the accounts of its electricity
operations from its various gas activities and expects to implement this



- 20 -
system in 1985.  Such a separation will be required ia order to comply with
existing agreements.  and eventually to monitor the performance of power
operations alone.
B.  Recent Performance
Return on Assets and Electricity Pricing
3.03     The Bank has measured the adequacy of STEG's electricity rates by
monitoring the rate of return on revalued assets, in addition to applying
other financial ratios and to comparing tariffs with the long run marginal
cost of supply (para. 1.22). In accordance with Tunisian accounting
practices, revaluation of assets has not been reflected in the official
accounts of the enterprise since 1970. However, STEG has carried out such a
revaluation on a pro-forma basis in accordance with procedures agreed upon
with the Bank, and the calculation of the asset bds'e through the end of 1982
was confirmed during negotiations. The covenant in the Third Power Project
(Loan No. 2003-TUN) establishes that at least an 8% return on revalued assets
should normally be achieved, except in years in which domestic prices of fuels
used for power generation by STEG increase by 20% or more, in which _Ca  a r'
return on assets would be acceptable. Under Aoan No. 2003-TUN, the Government
agreed further that electricity rates would be adjusted within two months
after each fuel price increase to fully compensate STEG for this increase.
3.04     A 7.5% return on revalued assets was achieved irn 1981 and again in
1982; in both years, fuel prices increased by considerably more than 20%
(Annex 1.9). In 1981, following the substantial January and July fuel price
increases of that year, rate increases occurred in February anid again in
September. In 1982, electricity rates were increased only once (average
revenue per kWh increased by 16% in October), while two price increases were
introduced for both fuel oil (18% in January and 26% in October) and gas oil
(9.5% in January and 16% in October). No fuel price increases nor any rate
inicreases occurred in 1983, in line with the Government's policy to limit
price increases in that year in all sectors of the economy. Based on
preliminary financial data, it is estimated that STEG will achieve a 6% return
on assets in 1983.
Financing Strategy and Debt Service Coverage
3.05     Historically, STEG has relied extensively on internally generated
funds and external borrowing to finance its expenditures in electric power and
gas. The past pattern of financing STEG's capital expenditures is shown in
Annex 3.1. Since 1977, the contribution of internal funds has fluctuated
l/ Loan Agreement for Second Natural Gas Pipeline Project, Loan 1864-TUN,
amended July 15, 1981 (Section 5.01).



- 21 --
depending on the size of the investment program in any given year.  When
contributions from customers, such as connection charges, are included with
internally generated cash, self-financing i8 seen to reach a level of about
40% overall in the period 1977-1982. Over chis period, the capital structure
of STEG has remained relatively unchanged with long-term debt representing
from 45 to 50% of long-term debt and equity. Governmernt contributions, which
have averaged only 7% of capital expenditures, are received principally to
support part of the cost of the national rural electrification prcgram being
executed by S'TG. Direct capital increases for STEG from the national budget
have been minimal (about 5% of capital expenditures in 1977-82) and recently
have been earmarked for investments in the exploitation and distribution of
gas.
3.06     To finance the foreign cost component of its investment program, STEG
has borrowed principally from European commercial banks as well as the Woriu
Bank, and has received loans on concessionary terms from German, Canadian and
American aid agencies and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development.
About three-quarters of STEG's long-term foreign borrowings are guaranteed by
the Government, including the five previous Worid Bank loans. Recently,
sources of long-term financing for ..ocal costs have also become available
through local investment banks, such as the SocidtA. Tuniso-Seoudienne
d'Investissement et de Ddveloppement,   In times of cash squeeze, STEG also
relies on overdraft facilities with local banks where its borrowing limit is
TD 2.5 million for rolling credit ("credit mobilisable") and TD 2.5 million
for authorized overdraft ("decouvert autorisd").
3.07     In recent years, STEG's loog term borrowing has increased
considerably. In 1983, borrowing was relied upon to finance a large share
(66%) of that year's investments, up from 35% in 1982. In 1984 this trend may
rise to a peak, with borrowing expected to finance almnost 70% cf this year's
high level of capital expenditures.
3.08     Increased long-term borrowing, combined with adverse currency
fluctuatons, have lowered STEG's debt service coverage, although it still
remains adequate. Under Loan 2003-TUN it is covenanted that, unless otherwise
agreed between STEG and the Bank, STEG shall not incur any debt unless its net
revenues for each year during the term of the debt to be incurred is at least
1.5 times the peojected debt service requirement for such year, on all its
debt, including the debt to be incurred. Maintaining a minimum debt service
coverage of 1.5 is important in order to assure that adequate provision is
made for possible adverse fluctuation of the Dinar against the foreign
currencies in which STEG's debt is denominated, and to assure that STEG builds
retained earnings to finance the expansion of the electric power system. The
existing debt service covenant would be continued under the propused Project.



- 22 -
3.09     In 1983, STEG's debt service coverage was 1.8 times, excluding
repayment of a short-term loan frow che Union Tunisienne des Banques (UTB)
which STEG wae waiting to renegotiEte.l/ This loan, or "credit relais,"
amounting to US$15 million and dencminated in US dollars, was to be paid back
within six months of the last disblirsement in 1980; however, STEG has
continued to pay interest only, peading rescheduling. The loans were used to
finance the installation of combupcion turbines, a long-term investment. The
UTB loan has new been renegotiated over seven years, including two years'
grace with payments starting in 1986. The level oi debt service coverage is
not expected to drop below 1.6 over the forecast period, assuming the minimum
return on assets is maintained. In the light of the UTB experience, the Bank
has urged STEG to apply sound financial principles by financing long-term
investments with long-term debt.
Working Capital and Receivables Collection
3.10     The current ratio has been held at a tight level of 0.9 over the last
three years. The 1982 level of receivables, equivalent to about 126 days of
sales revenue, was above the ceiling covenanted under Loan 2003-TUN (90 days
average sales). The 1983 level is estimated to be about 110 days. The
definition of accounts receivable for the purpose of monitoring this ratio was
clarified during negotiations. 2/
3.11     Public and semi-private enterprises were the largest customer
category accumulating arrears, accounting for almost 40% of arrears through
the end of 1982 (Table 3.1). The principal enterprises building up
receivables to STEG are SOTUVER (Socidt6 Tunisienne de Verrerie) and SOTEMI
(Societ6 Tunisienne d'Expansion Minibre). STEG has not been permitted to cut
off electricity supply to these public enterprises -- the practice used with
private customers with overdue accounts. After public enterprises, the most
problematic group of customers are the municipalities, which are faced with
operating deficits and long delays in obt-ining their budget allocations.
1/ If repayment to UTB were included, debt service coverage would have been
only 1.3 times.
2/ "Accounts receivable" include two categories which STEG treats
separately: (i) billings for which meters have beeni read but for which
payments are not yet overdue, and (ii) overdue bills, or arrears.

3.12     STEG and the Government agreed that a resolution of the arrears
problem, which would enable STEG to improve its working capital position, is
important. Some actions have already been taken to bring this about. A
convention was signed in 1982 between STEG and the Government which
established a repayment schedule for settling arrears due on both sides as of
December 31, 1981. l/ The arrears of SOTEMI were rescheduled by this
convention. STEG expects to reach a similar agreement in 1984 with SOTUVER,
which is in the process of overall financial rehabilitation by the Banque de
Developpement Economique de Tunisie.
3.13     STEG also informed the Bank that agreements had been reached with a
number of municipalities by early 1984, establishing a 3 to 5-year schedule
for repayment of accumulated arrears and providing assurances that new bills
would be paid promptly. Similar agreements were expected to be finalized with
all municipalities before end-1984. A proposal is presently being considered
by the Government whereby the existing municipal surtax of 2 millimes/kWh
collected by STEG on behalf of the municipalities only from low-voltage
consumers would be generalized starting in 1984, to apply to medium and
high-voltage consumers. The implementation of such a measure would strengthen
STEG's liquidity situation and assure that the municipalities have adequate
funds to uphold the agreements with STEG.
3.14     STEG agreed to continue to take necessary actions to assure that its
accounts receivable are no higher than the equivalent of 90 days of average
sales revenues. Unpaid receivables converted into debt would be included in
the definition of receivables. The Government agreed to take all measures
needed, including budget allocations, to ensure that national, regional and
municipal agencies pay STEG for electricity consumption on a timely basis.
1/ Overdue payments of receivables to STEG amount to TD 12.2 million, whereas
STEG was behind in tax payments to municipalities and debt service
payments to the Government, amounting to TD 13.6 million.



- 24 -
Other Business Activities
3.15     In addition to its core electricity and gas businesses, STEG is also
involved in a number of other activities. As a partial shareholder in over
thirty enterprises, STEG has investments in such sectors as transport,
tourism, agribusiness, consulting and metallurgy. At the end of 1982 the
market value of these shares was about TD 5 million. The return on these
investments has been below the opportunity cost of capital. In some cases
STEG has invested in a supplier, such as the Societe Industrielle
d'Appareillage et de Mat6riels Electriques (SIAVE), a manufacturer of
electricity meters, where STEG has almost 80% ownership. STEG is also
operating in the role of a financial institution, offering credits at below
market terms to customers for the purchase of water heaters. While STEG's
diversification is not yet causing a significant drain on its resources, it
would appear preferable for STEG to reinvest its retained earnings in the
iuaintenance of its own system, and new investments in other businesses, if any
at all, should be carefully monitored to assure that they yield adequate
returns justifying such investments.
C. Audit, Accounting Procedures, and
Management Information Systems
Audit and Accounting Procedures
3.16     After six years using the same auditor, STEG has cnanged auditors
annually since 1980. To audit the 1981 accounts and to review the management
information system, STEG employed FINOR, a local firm associated with Peat,
Marwick & Mitchell. While the FINOR audit proved thorough and effective, STEG
preferred not to employ again a firm for which services would need to be paid
partially in foreign exchange. For the 1982 audit, STEG selected a firm
acceptable to the Bank, the Tunisian firm of Bouraoui & Co., whose principal
was formerly with Coopers & Lybrand. For the 1983 audit, an interministerial
committee chaired by Treasury assigned an accredited auditor to STEG,
following new procedures established for the auditing of all public
enterprises.
3.17     In general STEG's accounting procedures are acceptable and STEG has a
strong central accounting and financial staff. Recent improvements in STEG's
accounting procedures were noted in the 1982 audit report. Utilization of
foreign debt and the foreign compone;t of fixed assets will now be converted
to Tunisian dinars at the weighted average exchange rate for the current year,
in order to represent these items more accurately on the balance sheet. This
replaces the previous system of using 1975 exchange rate. to convert foreign
debt and associated assets into dinars. Interest during construction is
charged to operations in accordance with the Tunisian National System of
Accounts.
3.18     Tt2 timing of submitting audit reports has frequently been delayed
due to: (a) bottlenecks with STEG's computer system which is relied upon to
consolidate the accounts; and (b) difficulties in getting data from
decentralized reporting units. The audit report, covenanted to be received by



- 25 -
the Bank no later than five months after the end of the fiscal year, has
normally been received, since the Bank began lending to STEG in 1972, about 9
months after the close of the fiscal year. For the 1981 and 1982 fiscal
years, the delay extended to 13 and 11 months respectively.  Steps currently
being taken to alleviate these problems (paras. 3.21-3.22) should make it
possible for STEG to produce its financial statements on a more timely basis
than previously, but still not within five months. STEG and the Bank agreed,
therefore, to modify the existing covenant, establishing that audited
financial statements would be received by the Bank within 6 months after the
end of each fiscal year, a schedule STEG believed to be feasible.
Insurance
3.19     STEG has insured its assets with a national company, against risks of
fire, explosion, mechanical and electrical damage at all generating plants and
substations of 90 kV and over, and against fire in the head office, district
offices, storage depots and warehouses. It carries its own risks in respect
of transmission and distribution lines, and distribution substations. This
arrangement is satisfactory, considering STEG's high operation and maintenance
standards.
Taxes
3.20     STEG is exempt from duties and taxes on its imported capital
equipment. Nonetheless, fixed assets are recorded as including taxes, and the
amount of tax savings is treated as a subsidy reflected over a 20-year
period. STEG is also exempt from tax on its net income. Direct taxes are
paid for various purposes, such as vehicles, property and training.
Management Information Systems
3.21     While the requirements for data processing are steadily increasing,
STEG has suffered from inadequate computer capacity and an outdated system.
In order of priority, the tasks of STEG's computer center are: customer
billing, accounting, and system planning and design. The existing IBM main
frame computer, was installed in 1974 and became subject to frequent
breakdowns. The work overload has also meant omitting corrections to data
needed to have an accurate record of sales, distribution losses and inventory
flows. A new and expanded data processing system supplied by Honeywell
Bull/Cll was being installed in mid-1984, including a second computer center
at Sfax serving the Southern region.
3.22     Improved data processing facilities alone will not accelerate the
completion of annual financial statements. Inadequate personnel development
and weak administrative systems at the regional and district levels were
identified by the 1981 audit report. STEG has experienced problems with
bunching of work orders, and administrative and inventory control are weak at
the regional level. Frequently, accounting and statistical errors are not
noted until data has been submitted to the central office, at which point much
more time is required to reconcile errors. Having received advice from its
auditors regarding the management information system and related
organizational weaknesses, it is essential that STEG now act on the
recommendations provided. STEG has indicated that it is not interested in



- 26 -
receiving external assistance in improving its overall management Lnformation
system; problems in this area should be monitored in the course of
supervisioni. Technical assistance in collecting, processing, and analyzing
data on sales and distribution losses is included under the energy component
of the Technical Assistance Project (2197-TUN), although STEG has decided not
to use the Bank funds allocated for this purpose.  STEG commissioned in
October 1983 an internal task-force to undertake a diagnostic study on the
problems of low voltage data and load forecasting (Annex 1.16); the
implementation stage began in early 1984.
D. Future Performance and Financing Plan
3.23     A table summarizing recent and forecast financial performance
indicators for STEG is given in Annex 3.2. Forecasts of STEG's financial
statements are presented in Annexes 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5. Explanations of the
assumptions used in these forecasts are presented in Annex 3.6.
3.24     The level of electricity rate increases likely to be required during
Project implementation will be affected principally by three factors;
(a)  the level and timing of fuel price increases;             /
(b)  the shift in the late 1980's from reliance on El Borma gas to fuel
oil or natural gas;l/ and
(c)  the commissioning of a major steam power plant (Rades Phase A in 1985
and Rades Phase B in 1988-89), which will add considerably to the
base on which the return on revalued assets is calculated.
Regarding fuel prices, as noted earlier (paca. 1.21, Aniuexes 1.9 arid 1.1G)
domestic fuel oil and gas oil prices had reached about 67% and 85%
respectively of international price levels by 1983, a significant increase
over domestic price levels in 1980, when fuel oil and gas oil (diesel) were at
about 40% and 70% of the respective border prices. The domestic price of gas
oil was increased further by 10% in early 1984. Moving fuel prices closer to
international parity has been made more difficult given the appreciation of
the US dollar (the currency in which oil prices are expressed) vis-a-vis the
Dinar by over 60% since the end of 1980. To reach international levels by
end-1986, the following schedule of increases in domestic fuel prices has been
assumed for the financial forecasts:
Expected   % Increase in
Domestic Prices
1985             1986         1987
Fuel oil                     20%              25%           2/
Gas oil (Diesel)             10%               2/           2/
Any further substantial appreciation of the US Dollar over the Tunisian Dinar,
or nny real increases in the international levels of petroleum products, would
1/ If additional domestic gas supplies become available, they will be charged
to STEG at the fuel oil equivalent price.
2/ Thereafter increasing at domestic inflation rate.



- 27 -
necessitate even greater increases in fuel prices to reach international
parlty. It was agreed that the Government and STEG would take all necessary
measures to assure that electricity tariffs are increased to reflect within
two months each increase in the price of fuel bought by STEG.
3.25     Financial Position in 1984:  In the light of public protests to
implementing price increases in basic foods experienced in early 1984, STEG's
electricity rate increases were delayed until June 1, 1984, when a 10%
increase became effective. The following relief measures to fill STEG's
anticipated 1984 financing gap were agreed to in December 1983 by the Ministry
of National Economy and STEG, and it was confirmed during negotiations that
these measures would be implemented in 1984:
Millions of TD
(a)  Capital increase for electricity investments         3.0
(b)  Postponing of investments                            3.0
(c) Postponing of debt service payments
from STEG to Government                              4.1
(d) Limit on recruitment of new staff and
on salary iLicreases, so that total wage
expenses in 1984 will be at most 8% higher
than in 1983                                         2.0
(e) Authorization of additional long-term
borrowing                                            8.0
Total reduction of STEG 1984
funds requirement                           20.1
Only step (d) above represents actual savings over the previous financial plan
for STEG. Steps (b) and (c) involve the postponement of expenses. With the
above actions, th- return on assets for 1984 is expected to be about 5%.
Howe-er, given STEG's satisfactory finaicial performance in the past, the Bank
should accept the lower rates of return for 1983 and 1984.
3.26     L985 and Afterwards:  The rate increases that would be required for
STEG to return immediately to compliance with its existing return on assets
covenant (para. 3.03) are thought to be too high to be feasible to implement
in Tunisia, particularly givenl the need to absorb the anticipated large
domestic fuel price increases.  Therefore, it was agreed that this covenant
would be nodified under the proposed loan, so that the target level of return
on assets would be reached in the next five years, as follows:
Minimum Return
Year                            on Revalued Assets  _
1985                                       5%
1986                                       5%
1987                                       7%  /1
1988 and afterwards                        8%  /1
/1 However, if fuel prices paid by STEG increase by 20% or more in any year
after 1986, the minimum return on assets to be achieved in that year would
be 6%.



- 28 -
3,27     The Government has confirmed to the Bank that it would consider
introducing by July 195 measures needed to comply with the agreed level of
return on assets for that year. An electricity rate increase of about 10  is
estimated to be needed effective July 1, 1985, in nominal terms but excluding
fuel adjustments. To adjust for the likely fuel cost increases, a 20 %
overall increase in rates in mid-1985 would be needed, followed by 18 % and
13% in 1986 and 1987 respectively. Smaller increases are presently estimated
to be needed in 1988 and afterwards, once STEG has returned to earning an 8%
return on assets.
3.28     Because the finiancial requirements of STEG's electric power
activities at the end of the decade could rot be accurately estimated at the
time of appraisal, it was agreed that the Bank would review with STEG and the
Government by June 30, 1986, or such other date as the Bank may agree, STEG's
financial performance and projected financial position for the period 1987 to
1991, in order to re-assess the appropriateness of the targets set for STEG's
return on assets.
3.29     As agreed under Loan 2003-TUN, STEG would continue to furnish to the
Government and the Bank by October 31 of each year a forecast showing the
expected rate of return for the current and the following year and the tariffs
on which the computations are based, together with a statement of any action
which STEG intends to take in order to achieve the agreed financial
covenants. To date, STEG has submitted these pro forma financial statements
on a timely basis, although sometimes the forecasts submitted showed the
deficit resulting from not implementing a tariff increase, instead of
indicating proposed measures.  Furthermore, the Government would furnish the
Bank with a timetable for action by December 31 of each year, starting in
1985, responding to STEG's forecasts of the measures required to comply with
the agreed financial ratios for the following year.
3.30     A tentative financing plan for STEG's capital expenditures from 1983
through 1988 is shown in Table 3.2. STEG's capital expenditures for this
six-year period in current prices are expected to amount to about TD 620
million or about US$930 million. This investment program, which is 35%
greater than the capital expenditures of the previous six years (1977-82) when
compared in 1983 prices, reflects STEG's decision to build up its steam plant
generating capacity, which is consistent with the least cost program. The
"lumpiness" which is typical of the investment program of any growing power
utility will be accentuated in the case of STEG in 1984, when for the
Rades (A) power plant alone, expenditures of TD 64 million are expected,
approximately the same level as total capital expenditures in 1982. The
construction expenditures for Rades (B), reaching a peak of about TD 50
million a year in both 1987 and 1988, will also cause an uneven jump in the
size of the investment program.

- 30 -
3.31     At projected tariff levels, SIEG would be able to finance 34% of this
investment program from internally generated funds, and an additional 9% from
customer contributions. Govermnent contributions would fund another 5% of the
program, and the remaining and largest share (53%) would be financed by
long-term borrowing. The heavy reliance on borrowing foreseen for 1983-88 may
stretch STEG's borrowing capacity near the limit, but is feasible. Although
STEG will become more highly leveraged, its ratio of long-term debt to
long-term debt plus equity is estimated to stay within an acceptable range of
50% to 60% during the implementation period of the proposed Project. Debt
service coverage is expected to remain about 1.7 tines, compared with the debt
service coverage prior to 1983 which stayed above 2.0 times. Of course
further appreciation of the foreign currencies in which STEG' s debt is
denominated would lower debt service coverage.  The electricity rate increases
recommended above are thus considered the mininum for STEG to maintain its
creditworthiness. While Rades (B) involves large equipment packages which
should make it possible for STEG to locate suppliers' credits on attractive
terms, other investments in transmission, distribution and network maintenance
will require financing from other sources, including commercial banks.  The
current practice of diversification of borrowing by country and type of
financial institution should assist STEG in raising the necessary funds.
3.32     In conclusion, the finaacing of STEG's ambitious investment program,
which will involve doubling the gross fixed asset base in a six-year period,
without reliance on Government capital increase, will be feasible, as long as
the Government does not prevent STEG from implementing gradual but regular
tariff increases, and STEG managemenc continues to identify opportunities for
improving operating efficiency.
IV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Background
4.01     Starting in 1975, the Government shifted emphasis in its economic
priorities with greater attention being given to measures to alleviate poverty
and reduce income inequalities.  Thus under the Fifth and Sixth NESDP
investment expenditures in the social sector were respectively 3 and 5.5 times
higher than those incurred under the Fourth NESDP. Through the improvement of
living standards and the creation of employment in the rural areas, the
Government aims at reducing the urban migration rate.  The Government's
objectives are being substantially achieved since the percentage of population
living below the absolute poverty level decreased from 22% in 1975 to 12.9% in
198CL0  while the number of rural and urban poor declined by 28% and 44%
1/ The corresponding percentages below the absolute poverty level were 18% in
1975 and 14.1% in 1980 for the rural population with 'he annual. income
level for absolute poverty calculated at 43 TD and 60 TD in 1975 prices.
For the same years, the corresponding figures for the urban areas were
26.5% and 11.8%, with income levels of 87 TD and 120 TD.



- 31 -
respectively. Though :he reduction of poverty achieved in rural areas is
impressive, the urban areas benefited most from the Governmental measures.
Thus, the Governmentts priority under the Sixth NESDP is to gradually increase
the share of benefits accruing to the rural areas.
4.02     With respect to electricity, the Government's target is to increase
the access to electricity service of the country from 40% in L977 to about 71%
by 1988. Bank's assistance in this endeavour is already being provided under
Loan 2003-TUN to partly finance the 1982-1984 rural electrification program.
4.03     The rural electrification components under Loan 2003-TUN and the
proposed Project are part of the investment in social infrastructure needed to
achieve the above objectives.  In addition to being warranted on social
grounds, the proposed Project has obvious economic merits, as evidenced by the
anticipated benefits to accrue from this Project.
4.04     About 5% of the total villages to be supplied with electricity
service under the proposed Project were included on purely social grounds.
However, the overall mix of villages is such that as a whole the rural
electrification component is economically justified (para. 4.06). The
rehabilitation of the transmission/distribution network is necessary to reduce
losses, and to provide a better quality of service to the consumers. In the
long run, loss reduction could result, in addition to generating extra
revenues for the sector, in delaying investments in additional capacity.
B. Least Cost Alternative
4,05     On the basis of identified potential customers in 1980, the Project
wii. extend electricity service to about 27,900 new domestic consumers and
about 1,400 surface pumps situated in about 700 villages. Taking into account
the growth experienced under the ongoing Project where the connection rate was
on the average 30% higher than expected, these figures were revised upwards to
35,000 and 1,500 respectively for the purpose of calculating more accurately
the return on the investment (para. 2.04). The two viable alternatives for
achieving this objective are either the installation of isolated generating
systems, or the connection of villages to the main grid. Since the
distribution system is common to both alternatives, its cost has been excluded
for the least cost analysis. Therefore, the least cost analysis consists of
determining the cost break-even point between the two supply options by
calculating the average length of the subtransmission line whose cost,
together with the cost of generation of the integrated system, would equate
the cost of installing, operating and maintaining an isolated generating
station of average size which would serve the same number of customers at a
comparable level of reliability. The assumptions used ina determining the
least cost alternative are given in Annex 4.1. The average length of the
transmission line at which the cost of the two supply alternatives is
equivalent was found to be 21 kn. Since the average distance of the MV line
for this Project is 4 km, connection of villages to the main grid constitutes



- 32 -
the least cost solution. The least cost analysis of STEG's investment program
is given in Annex 4.2. It indicates that STEG's expansion program constitutes
the least cost alternative to meet demand. The equilizing discount rate, i.e.
the rate which would equate the present investment program and the second
least cost solution is 24%.
C. Return on Investment
4.06     The urban distribution component has merits of its own, most of which
are not quantifiable. In addition to reducing losses and hence curtailing the
need for investment in additional capacity while increasing STEG's revenues,
these rehabilitation measures would improve the quality of service provided by
STEG. Thus, the rate of return was not calculated on this component nor on
the provision of equipment, tools, and training.
4.07     Benefits associated with the rural electrification component include:
(i)   incremental revenues associated with the sale of electricity to
rural consumers which are taken as proxy for the consumer's
willingness to pay;
(ii)   connection and meter charges; and
(iii)   net fuel savings to the consumers.
4.08     The long run average incremental cost of electricity (LRMC) delivered
to the rural distribution network is taken as a proxy for the economic cost of
electricity supplied to the consumers. Assumptions used for the calculation
of the economic rate of return are given in Annex 4.3.
4.09     Based on the above, the return on the rural electrification component
is 12.7%. This return which compares favorably with the opportunity cost of
capital in Tunisia estimated at 10.0%, is not a measurement of the economic
viability of the Project but rather indicates the relationship of tariffs to
the cost of supply. The rate of return is more sensitive to clianges in the
tariff level than to changes in the capital cost of the project. A decrease
of 10% in the tariff level reduces the rate of return on the project to 10.8X,
while an increase of 10% in the capital cost of the project lowers the rate of
return to 11.6% (Annex 4.4).
4.10     A rate of return on STEG's oveiall inkoestment program was also
calculated with benefits calculated on the basis of incremental sales valued
at the projected electricity rate in real terms. The rate of return is found
to be 11.6% (Annex 4.5). This is, however, an underestimation since the
generating plant to be installed would be used not only to meet incremental
demand but also to substitute for the fall in output stemming from the
retirement of existing generating units.

V. AG1BEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIOVS
5.01     The Government will:
(a)  progressively increase domestic consumer prices for petroleum
products so that prices for these products are at least equal to
international price levels for these products, by December 31, 1986
(para. 1.21);
(b)  take all measures needed, including budget allocations, to ensure
that national, regional and municipal agencies pay STEG for
electricity consumption on a timely basis (para 3.14);
(c)  implement revised electricity tariffs promptly, and in any case not
later than 2 months after tne fuel price increases, so that STEG
recovers the total increases in its fuel cost (para 3.24); and
(d)  furnish to the Bank by December 31 of each year starting in 1985 a
timetable for action responding to STEG's forecasts of the measures
required to comply with the agreed financial ratios for the following
year (para 3.29).
5.02     The Government and STEG wL.ll:
(a)  carry out a study of actual tariffs compared with the long run
marginal cost of electricity supply, followed by actions to implement
the conclusions of this study (para 1.23);
(b)  implement remedial measures to reduce STEG's 1984 financing deficit
(para 3.25);
(c)  take necessary measures for STEG to achieve a rate of return on
revalued assets of 5% in 1985 and 1986, 7% in 1986 and 8% in 1988 and
afterwards (para. 3.26); and
(d)  review with the Bank, by June 30, 198t, or such later date as the
Bank may agra,, STEG's financial performance and projected financial
position for the period 1987 to 1991, including a determination of
the appropriate future level for STEG's return on assets (para 3.28).
5.03     STEG will:
(a)  undertake a set of actions leading to efficiency improvements and
system loss reductions, ononitor progress achieved through a list of
key performance indicators, and furnish to the Bank for review by

7T  it is assumed that all of the royalty gas fron, the transcontinental
pipeline will be consumed domestically and will substitute for petroleum
products, i.e., this balance does not reflect the possibility that Tunisia
will opt to sell all or part of the royalty gas as an export. The
development of the El Franig gas field is also not included in this energy
balance.

II. Assumptions Used in Estimation of LRMC
A. Capacity Cost
Time horizon:
1. Generation 1/
Phase B of the Rades Steam Power Plant (300 MW of available installed
capacity), expected to be commissioned in 1988, is considered the source
of incremental supply.
At 10% opportunity cost of capital, the discounted present value of
the investments in Rades B is TD 64,613,000.
Cost per kW installed = TD 64,613,000 = TD 215.35/kW
300 MW
Assuming a 25-year plant life and 10% interest, the annuity factor is
0.110.
Cost per kW/year = TD 215 x 0.11 = TD 23.69
I/ This estimate assumes no fuel savings.

Page 2 of 5
Allowing for a reserve margin of 35%, and assuming fixed cost for
operations and maintena'nce (O&M) expenditures at 2% of capital cost,
the marginal capacity cost of power generation is:
TD 23.69 x 1.35 x 1.02 = TD 32.62/kW/yr.
2.   Transmission and Distribution
(a) High Voltage
The present value of investments in HV transmission required for
the incremental generation is TD 194,000 /1 when discounted to 1983.
The Net Present value of incremental HV maximum demand is 20 MW.
Assuming a 30-year life for the HV network and 10% interest, the
annuity factor is 0.106.
The marginal capacity cost of transmision
TD 194000 x 0.106 = TD 1.028/kW/year
20 MW
(b) medium voltage
The present value of investments (discounted to 1983) in MV
transmission required for the incremental generation is rD 1,718,000.
The net present value of incremental MW maximum demand is 65 MW.
Assuming a 30-year life for the MV network and a 10% interest
rate, the annuity factor is 0.106.
The marginal capacity cost of MV transmission
TD 1,718,000 x 0.106 = TD 2.802/kW/year
65 MW
(c) Low Voltage
The present value of investments (discounted to 1983) in LV
distribution required for the incremental generation is TD 4,815,000.
The net present value of incremental LV maximum dernand is 54 MW.
1/ This estimate assumes the following contribution to maximum demand: HV,
14.4%; MV, 46.4%; LV, 39.2%.

Schedule for Improving STEG's
Operations and Monitoring Indicators 1/
System Losses
1.       Due to unavailable data, STEG is currently estimating transmission
and distribution losses by subtracting energy (kWh) actually billed by
December 31 of any particular year, from actual net generation as of the same
date. Although adequate means exist for determining losses, the losses of the
distribution system include energy metered but unbilled. In addition, there is
no systematic follow-up on adjustments and corrections made to bills following
customers' bill contestations.  Classification of customers on the basis of
end-use of power -- and therefore the applicable tariff -- differs among
districts, and metering errors stemming from non-functioning meters or display
on the meters of inaccurate meter-reading multipliers (in cases of metering
through current and/or voltage transformers) have been observed. To remedy
the inefficiencies of the existing system a task force was established on
October 12, 1983 to examine the entire process of data collection and
treatment. the initial report of this task force (December 1983) identifies
the deficiencies of the existing system and recommends to the undertaking, by
December 31, 1984, of studies aimed at the following:
(a) adapting the collection of data to the actual needs of the users;
(b) defining the actual needs of data users;
(c) filling the gap of missing data, revising data collection sheets and
recording instructions, improving control, and training of the staff;
(d) adapting computer programs accordingly; and
(e) establishing procedure for the automatic follow-up, update and
control of the information system.
Progress of the above task would be monitored against the following targets:
(a) completion by January 31, 1985 of said studies;
(b) implementation by June 30, 1985 of recommendations of said studies;
(c) estimation by December 31, 1985 of unbilled metered consumption; and
1/ The substance of this annex is also included in supplementary Letter
No. 5 to the Loan Agreemnent.

(d)  initiation by December 31, 1985 of a program aimed at the improvement
of metering accuracy. 1/
2.       STEC would also submit to the Bank by March 31, of each year,
starting in 1986, the following monitoring indicators pertaining to the
operations of the previous calendar year:
-    own consumption of each generating plant;
-    transmission losses;
-    unbilled metered consumption; and
-    distribution losses.
Operating Efficiency
3.       In the last few years STEG has been very conscious of opercting
efficiency improvements.  To this end it has been expanding its load
management program by installing dual tariff meters and introducing new
time-of-day tariffs, and is currently installing a modern dispatching center.
In addition, it has completed a study aiming at the reinforcement, expansion
and improvement of the transmission and distribution system of the greater
Tunis area. STEG is also intending to conduct similar studies for other large
urban areas. Progress of operating efficiency improvements would be monitored
against the following targets:
(a) complete the study of the transmission and distribution area of:
-    Beja and Sfax, by December 31, 1985; and
-    Bizerte, Sousse and Gabes, by December 31, 1987.
(b) extension of the ripple control system to about eight additional
HV/MV substations by June 30, 1988.
11 This program would include, but not be limited to:
- the reporting by the meter reader of low or no electricity consumption
when customer is making use of his supply service;
- the testing by the measurement laboratory of all measuring current and
voltage transformers, and the control of meter-reading multipliers; and
- the field testing of suspected defective meters.

4.       STEG would also submit to the Bank by March 31, of each year,
starting in 1985, the following monitoring indicators pertaining to the
operations of the previous calendar year:
-    average fuel consumption (kcal) per kWh generated;
-    availability of each generating unit;
-   ,;generation re3erve margin;
-    system's load duration curve;
-    system's load factor;
-    system's peak load and sales by voltage level (RV, MV and LV);
-    number of installed ripple-control relays and relevant off-peak
consumption (GWh);
-    number of employees per MWh of sales;
-    number of customers per employee; and
-    total cost per GWh generated.

POWER IV PROJECT
Renewable Energy Resources
Solar
1.       Of the two solar demonstration projects completed in Tunisia
(para. 1.07), the first (total cost of about TD 400,000) involves the
installation of a solar collector which, through an organic coolant, drives a
10 kW turbine supplying power, mainly for lighting, to a small village of
about 200 inhabitants. The second project (total cost about TD 700,000),
covers a broad spectrum of solar energy use and involves the installation of
two photovoltaic systems (a small and a larger one), a solar water heater, a
greenhouse with heat storage walls, and a drip irrigation scheme. The small
photovoltaic system provides power to a small farm, while the larger system
(27 kW useful capacity with 130,000 kWh annual output) provides power for
lighting in a village of about 500 inhabitants (Hammam Biadha), the local
school and dispensary, one communal refrigerator, and a small surface pump.
oslian
2.       In addition to the multi-blade wind mill project undertaken by SEREPT
(para. 1.08), another application of renewable energy under study is the
installation of wind-powered electric generators. The proposed sites include
the village of Sidi Mechrig (70 hou&aholds) at Cap Serrat where two units of 5
to 8 kW could '.e installed, and the island of Kerkennah, where one unit of
25 kW could be installed. However, data on the wind regime for the proposed
locations will need to be collected before a decision for the final locations
of these units is taken. The unit of Kerkennah and one of the units of Sidi
Rechrig would be financed by USAID, while the second unit of Sidi Mechrig
would be finautced by the Tunisians themselves.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A. General
1.       The forecasts were made in current prices, applying the following
local inflation rates:
1982           1983           1984           1985-1988
12.6%          ].0%            9%                8%
2.       Given that forecast inflation rates in Tunisia are quite sumilar to
expected international levels of inflation, a constant exchange rate of US 3l
.67 Tunisian Dinar has been assumed.
B.  Income Statement
3.       Sales;  For purposes of the base financial forecasts, an average
annual growth in electricity sales of 10.3%, which STEG refers to as the "lov'
scenario, has been used. (The "medium" scenario assumes 11.5% p.a. growth in
sales, with a 14% increase for 1984.) Unit sales of electricity and gas are
projected as follows, not including STEG's "sales" of gas to itself:

4.       Prices;  Electricity tariffs, shown in Annex 3.3 without taxes
included, have been projected from 1985 onwards in order to meet the following
rates of return on revalued assets: 1985 - 5%; 1.986 - 5%; 1987 - 7%; 1988 and
after - 8%.
5.       Fuel expenses were estimated by applying the average specific
consumption rate for each fuel to the nuuiber of kilowatthours to be generated
with each fuel type.

Fuel prices paid by STEG in January 1984 are shown below. In order
to reach international parity, the donestic price of fuel oil would haved to
increase by 20% in 1985 and by 25X in 1986, and the domestic price of gas oil
by 10% in 1985. Afterwards, changes in fuel prices are expected to follow
the forecast local inflation rate. Electricity rates are expected to be
adjusted within two months to take account of fuel price increases.

6.       Materials expenses, are expected to increase in real terms over the
1982 level at about 7%, in other words, at slightly less than the sales growth
rate. Other operating expenses, including maintenance, salaries, and
transport, are expected to increase by 2% p.a. in real terms. Local inflation
rates have been applied to express expenses in current prices.
7.       Depreciation is estimated at 4% of revalued fixed assets in service.
8.       Direct taxes charged for vehicles, training, property, etc., are
estimated to stay constant in real terms.
9.       Interest during construction is not capitalized, according to
national Tunisian accounting practices.
C. Balance Sheet
10.      Gross fixed assets in service and accumulated depreciation have been
revalued using the wholesale price index. The revaluation reserve has been
increased annually by the amount of fixed asset revaluation, less the
revaluation of the accumula;ed depreciation account.

ANNEX 3.6
Page 4 of 4
11.      Accounts receivable are estimated at 90 days of revenue from gas and
electricity sales, starting in 1984, decreasing gradually to 80 days by 1989,
reflecting the implementation of measures expected to improve collection of
receivables.
12.      Government and customer contributions together have been estimated to
finance 60% of expected investments in rural electrification, which is
equivalent to about 40% of the annual investments in electricity distribution
(including rural and urban). Government contributions as shown on the balance
sheet for 1981 and 1982 include net subsidies on equipment purchases, plus 40%
of "participation des tiers nettes" as recorded in audit report. These
contributions have not been revalued on the balance sheet, but have been
revalucd for purposes of calculating the asset rate base.
13.      Long-term debt has been increased as necessary to finance expected
investments, after relying on self-financing to the extent available. Long
term borrowing has been assumed at an interest rate of 9%, with an average
three year grace period, and ten years for repayment.  The short-term UTB loan
("credit relais") of US"15 million, equivalent to about TD 10 million, is
assumed to be rescheduled and paid back in equal installments over 5 years
with the first payment occurring in 1986.

Assumptions Used for Project Least Cost Analysis
1.       The average number of customers per village is assumed to be 40 the
first year increasing to 80 the 15th year of supply of service.
2.       The average demand per village would be 6 kVA during the first ten
years of supply of service, 20 kVA for year 10 to 20, and about 50 kVA
thereafter.
3.       A single-phase 25 kVA transformer would be used up to year 10 at
which time an additional equal size transformer (or replacement with a 50 kVA
transformer) would be installed. A 25 kVA transformer is estimated to cost TD
1,200.
4.       For the first 10 years, a 40 HP motor-generator set would be used to
supply the average village. From year 10 to 20, a 7; HP set would be needed,
which in turn would be replaced with a 100 HP set from year 21. The average
cost of a generator is assumed at;
(i) TD 7,000 for 30 HP (installed)
(ii) TD 12,000 for 50 HP (installed)
(iii) TD 17,000 for 75 HP (installed)
5.       The average size of the generator set was determined to meet the
annual consumption of 124 MWh for an average village.
6.       Specific fuel consumption of diesel generator set is estimated to be
320 gr/kWh.
7.       Cost of fuel (diesel-oil) is assumed at TD 162/ton.
S.       Cost of lubricants, attendance and maintenance of motor-generator set
is assumed at TD 8,000 per year.
9.       Cost of MV line is assumed to be TD 4,000/km.
10.      Average long run marginal cost of supplying power at MV, including
maintenance cost, was calculated at 48.3 milliemes/kWh.
11.      Discount rate:  10%.
12.      Economic lifetime of motor generator;  10 years.
13.      Economic lifetime of the Project:  30 years.

Least Cost Analysis for STEG's
Investment Program
The least cost analysis of STEG's investment program is performed
only for investment in generation since transmission and distribution network
would be essentially identical under all alternative generation plans.
In the absence of the 2 x 300 MW steam plant investment at Rades, the
only other feasible alternative would be investment in gas turbines. At 10,
12, and 15% opportunity cost of capital, Rades has a lower net present cost
than the gas turbines. The equalizing discount rate, i.e. the rate at which
the net present cost of the two supply options are identical, is 24%.

Assumptions Used for the Calculation of the Economic
Rate of Return of the Rural Electrification Component
A. Domestic Consumers
1.       Rural families are presently using a single kerosene lamp for
lighting purposes at an estimated cost of TD 45 per year (including equipment,
maintenance and fuel). The same service, namely, lighting, could be met with
a 60 W lamp (130 kWh/year).
2.       About 40% of the rural families are presently usir3 battery operated
television and radio sets at an estimated cost of TD 100 per year (battery
purchase, charging and replacement). The same service could be met by using
100 kWh per year.
3.       The above services could be met by consuming on the average 175 kWh
per year (charged at 61 millirres/KWh) if electricity were available.
4.       Presently, the average cost of connection of a domestic consumer is
TD 55, and the electrical installation for a ruc-;l house is estimated at TD
110.
B. Surface Pumping
1.       Diesel engines (10 HP) are currently used for water pumping.  It is
assumed that these engines would be replaced after 5 years. On the average,
pumps operate 500 hours per year with an annual fuel consumption of about 1.3
tons (260 gr/HPh). The economic life of a new unit is assumed 10 years.
Replacement cost of pumps is assumed to be TD 2,500. A residual value of
1,000 TD has also been assumed.
2.       Border price of diesel oil is taken as TD 162/ton.
3.       The purchase price, installation cost and connection charges of an
electric pump are assumed to be TD 1,000, TD 300 and TD 90, respectively. The
yearly consumption of the pump has been assumed to be 2,500 kWh, and the
electricity tariff 32 milliemes/kWh.
C. Fuel Savings
Fuel savings were calculated conservatively on only 80% of the yearly
consumption of the new consumers that would be connected to the grid during
implementation of the Project (1985-1987). Thus, the fuel savings used in
calculating the rate of return reflect the savings that would accrue by
displacing alternative sources of energy, which would have been consumed, if
the Project was not implemented.

D. Capital and O&M
1.       The economic life of the Project:  30 years.
2.       Capital cost of the rural distribution network to be expensed in the
years 1985-1987.
3.       Operating and maintenance cost of the rural distribution network is
computed at 2% of the capital cost.
4.       The average incremental cost (at MV level) of electricity supplied to
the rural consumers is calculated at 56.01 millieme/kWh for domestic use, and
4,.8 for pumping.
E. Revenues
1.       Sales of electric energy for each consumer category valued at STEG's
projected tariffs expressed in real terms.
2.       Net fuel savings to the consumers who would switch from their present
supply of energy to centrally supplied electricity.
3.       Base year:  1983.

The Economic Rate of Return on STEG's
Overall Investment Program
1.       The rate of return on the investment program is calculated on a
30-year period. Cost and revenues are expressed in 1983 prices.
2. Cost
- Capital cost of the 2 x 300 MW investment in Rades A and B to be
commissioned in 1985 and 1988 respectively.
- Capital cost of the investment in transmission and distribution
network over the period 83-88.
-  Fuel cost for the generation of incremental sales (station use are
computed at 4% and system losses at 12%).
- Fixed Operating and maintenance costs are calculated at 2% of capital
cost.
3. Revenues
- Incremental sales from 1985 (Annex 1.5) valued at the projected
tariff in real terms.
