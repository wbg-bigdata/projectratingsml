MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$100 MILLION
TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
FOR A WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation  on a proposed loan to
the Argentine Republic for US$100 million equivalent is submitted for
approval by the Board. The proposed loan would have a term of 17 years,
with 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable rate.
2.       Background.  For 100 years,  water suppi? and sewerage services in
urban  and  rural  areas  in   Argentina were  administered  by  a  single
government-owned entity, Obras Sanitarias de la Nacion (OSN). Under QSN's
tutelage, by 1930 Argentina had taken the lead in Latin America in
environmental   sanitation;    however,    in    subsequent   decades   its
accomplishments were not sustained.    Abundant  financial resources, up to
the 1950s, led to  inefficient  investments  and delayed the application of
modern commercial and manage.: J  tf :1rJoues.  Actions taken since that time
by   successive  governments  to  improve  performance  have  been short of
providing satisfactory results. At present, Argentina ranks 14th among the
21 major countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region in percent of
urban and rural population connected to a piped water system (60Z) and is
19th in percent of urban population connected to a public sewerage system
(34Z).      This   poor   showing   is   especially   disappointing  since:
(a) Argentina's GNP per capita is the fourth highest in the regions and (b)
unsafe water and sanitary conditions rank fifth among fourteen major causes
of mortality, including parasitic diseases and related illnesses.
3.       Actions to improve  sector  performance  have been oriented toward
decentralizing services away from OS. In 1966, the Government removed the
rural sector from OSN's activity administration, establishing the Servicio
Nacional de Agua  Potable  y  Saneamiento  Rural  (SNAP).    In  1980, the
Government entrusted the provincial governments with providing water and
sewerage  services,  limiting   OSN's   activities   to  the  Buenos  Aires
Metropolitan  Area.          Finally,   under   the   Menem  administration,
administrative and financial responsibilities of OSN are being delegated to
a Board comprised of representatives of Buenos Aires province, the city of
Buenos  Aires,  and  the  central  Government.       The  next  step  in  the
restructuring  of  OSN  is  the   delegation   to  the  private  sector  of
responsiblity for the operation of OSN's infrastructure.
4.       Unfortunately, the provinces  did not  have the institutional and
financial framework capable of adequately managing the services for which
they assumed  responsibility.    As  a  result  of  this,  urban  and rural
concentrated populations connected to a piped water system dropped between
1980 and 1986 (from 67Z  to  60Z).   In addition, while sewerage connection
rates slightly increased between 1980 and 1986 (from 31Z to 34X), a large
percentage of all raw sewage is still discharged into rivers and lakes
(65Z), with a small percentage undergoing only primary treatment (27?), and



- 2 -
an even lesser percentage undergoing secondary treatment (8Z). This poses
serious; health and environmental risks for the population, especially for
the poor. Moreover, sector investments fell by two thirds from US$900
million in 1976-80 to US$300 million in 1981-85, and from 3 to 42 of total
public investments in the 1970s to 22 in 1981-85.
5.       To reverse the long decline in service coverage and quality level,
the Ministry of Public Works, assisted by financial support from the Bank's
First Water Supply Project (Loan 2641-AR), developed in 1988 a National
Sanitation Plan (NSP) and began to implement a pilot program in three
cities (Buenos Aires, Cordoba, and Rosario).   The aim of the pilot program
was to rehabilitate deteriorating infrastructure, to extend water services
to new urban areas, and to improve the operations and management of the
provincial utilities.
6.       In addition, to provide  the  institutional framework to carry out
the NSP, the Congress enacted in 1988 legislation that transformed SNAP
into the Consejo Federal de Agua Potable y Saneamiento (COFAPYS). COFAPYS
is now the Government's financial agency responsible for assisting the
provinces in developing the sector in consonance with the Government's
policies and priorities as  follows:    (a) increasing participation of the
beneficiaries and the private sector in the provision of services; (b)
increasing the administrative responsibilities and the mobilization of
resources at the municipal level; and tc) increasing the autonomy and
financial viability of existing public water and sewerage entities.
7.       Rationale  for  Bank  Involvement.    Key  aspects  of  the Bank's
strategy in Argentina include assisting the Government to: (a) strengthen
public finances at the national and provincial levels; (b) improve the
allocation   of   public   spending;   and   (c) increase   private  sector
participation in providing public services. To this end, the Bank is
supporting reform of state-owned enterprises and provincial and municipal
finances. The proposed project is an important element in this strategy,
since it is part of a set of actions being taken by the Government to
strengthen the provincial government's capacity to plan, finance, and
execute financially sustainable and institutionally manageable investment
programs. These actions are being supported by the Bank through the
proposed Provincial Development Project.   Within this context, the project
translates broad public sector reform programs into targetted actions at
sector and enterprise levels. Moreover, it would help to strengthen public
finances by committing water and sewerage utilities to implement financial
policies that will enable them to operate without Government subsidies.
8.       Continued Bank support for the Argentine water supply and sewerage
sector is timely for several reasons.    First,  for a number of years, the
Government and the Bank have been discussing policy and institutional
arrangements  required  to   overcome   the  constraints  affecting  sector
development.  Agreements reached during  this  dialogue are embodied in the
ongoing Water Supply Project (Loan  2641-AR), the first such Bank operation
in Argentina, as well as in the sector study conducted by the Bank and the
Government in 1987 (IBRD Report  No.  6768-AR).   The proposed project is a
direct outcome of this dialogue. Second, Bank participation in the project
has encouraged other international cofinancing, since the Bank loan would



be complemented by IDB financing for an equal amount. IDB financing would
be through two loans. One for US$70 million equivalent from the Ordinary
Capital, and the other for US$30 million from the Special Pund (loan with
concessionary terms--3%  interest rate).   Third, the project would
complement and build on previous Bank's efforts to assist Argentina in
implementing stabilization and structural adjustment measures.   It also
would alleviate the social costs of adjustment by providing services to
low-income groups and by generating employment in project-related
activities. Fourth, Bank participation in the project would encourage the
adoption of measures to improve the environment.
9.       Proiect Objectives.   Overall proje.zt objectives, in line with
Government policies, are to: (a) promote greater sector efficiency and
financial viability; (b) expand service coverage; (c) improve the quality
of the water supply and sewerage services while protecting the environment;
and (d) encourage private sector participation in the water and sanitation
sector.
10.      Project Description.  The operation would be a sector investment
project managed by COFAPYS, which would onlend the proceeds of the Bank
loan to water suprly and sewerage entities in urban areas (15,000
inhabitants or more) meeting agreed eligibility criteria.   Investments
eligible for financing under the project consist of those required to: (a)
improve the operations of water utilities (40% of project costs);  (b)
rehabilitate water and sewerage systems (30%);  (c) expand water and
sewerage systems (25%);  (d) prepare studies and designs (4%); and (e)
improve COFAPYS' operations (1%).
11.      COFAPYS would onlend proceeds of the proposed loan to public and
private water and sewerage entities. COFAPYS subloans would be denominated
in dollars at the same variable interest rate as the Bank loan, plus a
spread for the financing of the project administrative expenses, the credit
risk and the cross-currency exchange risk from the Bank's Cu-rency Pooling
System.  The initial spread will be six percentage points ,_our to cover
administrative expenses and credit risk, and two to cover the cross-
currency exchange risk). It would also charge a commitment fee at least
equal to the one charged by the Bank.
12.      Total project cost is estimated at US$250 million equivalent.
The total foreign exchange cost is estimated at US$141.3 million, or 57% of
the total cost. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.  A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Argentina is given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8425-AR dated November 26, 1990 is also
attached.
13.      The Bank and the IDB would each cover 40% of total project cost
for an aggregate level of external financing of 80%.  This is justified
given the need to reactivate a sector whose performance has been
deteriorating for years, with negative implications for the standard of



living of the poor and the availability of services for directly productive
activities. Of the remaining 20Z of total project co.t, at least 70Z would
be  financed  by  the water   entities   and  the  balance  by  provincial
governments.
14.      COFAPYS and the water  supply  and  sewerage entities will require
substantial technical assistance by outside consultants to carry out the
project effectively. In view of this, COFAPYS will hire and maintain five
consultants,  acceptable  to  the   Bank,   who  have  broad  international
experience in: (a) technical evaluation of water supply and sewerage
projects; (b) socio-economic evaluation of water and sewerage projects;
(c) commercialization and financial management of water and sewerage
services;   (d)   financial   management   of   credit   institutions;  and
(e) environmental assessment. The utilities will also hire consultants to
assist them in the execution of their r-spective subprojects.
15.      Issues and Actions.      During negotiations, agreement was reached
on the following: (a) the Government and COFAPYS will annually exchange
views with the Bank on: (i) progress made in achieving COFPPYS' operational
and financial targets; (ii) adequacy of the terms and conditions of the
subloans; (iii) COFAPYS' compliance with agreed credit regulations and
enforcement of subloan agreements, particularly in relation to consumption
metering, billing and collection, operation and maint nance, financial
performance,  and  auditing;  (iv)  achievement  of  Bank    agreed overall
participation in project financing (40Z of  the total pi   ct cost over the
life of the loan); (v) implementation of environmer.. - provisions; and
(vi) methodologies and assumptions for updating COFAPYb' operational and
financial   performance   targets;   (b) COFAPYS'   establishment   of   an
environmental assessment unit; and (c) prior review 1- the Bank of the
first six subprojects to be financed with Bank loan resources, as well as
subprojects whose total cost is the equivalent of US$5 million or more. In
addition, conditions of effectiveness for the Bank loan would includes (a)
the approval of the IDB loans, which are scheduled for Board consideration
in January 1991, and (b) COFAPYS submission to the Bank of at least three
subprojects eligible for financing under the project.
16.      Benefits.   The  proposed  project  would  yield economic, fiscal,
social, and environmental benefits. Economic benefits include higher water
sales and cost savings resulting from investments aimed at promoting
efficiency. By promoting water consumption metering, the project will
enable currently wasted water to be saved at a cost of about 15? of the
marginal  cost  of  expanding   production  capacity.  With  tariff  levels
approaching this marginal cost, the investments in metering will have a
high  cost-benefit  ratio.       In   addition,   by  promoting  operational
improvements and adequate system maintenance, the project would enable
existing system capacity to provide services to more customers at one-fifth
the cost of building new installations; and, on the basis of the experience
with other water and sewerage system rehabilitation projects in Latin
America, it is expected that most investments in this category will show
rates of  return  of  202  and  above.    Fiscal  benefits  will  accrue as
operational cash surpluses of water entities and customer contributions
resulting from policies to be implemented under the project begin to
replace general tax  revenue.    Social  benefits include expanding service
coverage to low-income groups and creating employment in project-related
activities. Also, under the project's commercialization program, tariffs



. 5 -
that are now based on unmetered consumption will be replaced by a
progressive tariff, which will make it possible to cross-subsidize low-
income users.   A beneficial environmental impact would occur through
targetted investments to reduce water consumption and thus the amount of
sewage disposal, and through the discipline induced by preparing
environmental impact assessments for all projects financed by COFAPYS.
17.      Risks and Safeguards.   The main project risks are financial,
institutional, and political. The financial risk concerns the availability
of domestic financing and the foreign exchange risk.   The domestic
financing risk has been greatly reduced by: (a) emphasis on investment and
policy reforms to increase financial viability of the water entities; and
(b) the relatively small local counterpart required. The foreign exchange
risk to be passed on to the water entities represents a substantial
chalLenge to their managements, which lack experience in this area and are
subject to price setting by provincial authorities that also lack similar
management sophistication. The risk is reduced by the project emphasis on
strengthening the management of the water entities along with their
financial performance.   COFAPYS' financial consultant would also provide
advice to the water entities about managing the foreign exchange risk. The
risk is also acceptable taking into consideration that the National and
provincial governments' policy is to ensure that the provision of water and
sanitation servi.,es is financially viable. Institutional risks pertain to
project success depending directly on:   (a) COFAPYS' ability to onlend
under agreed economic, financial, institutional, and environmental
criteria; and (b) the provincial utilities' abilities to focus on
institutional reform and system maintenance and rehabilitation--areas where
they are now weak. These risks are offset by COFAPYS and the utilities
hiring of qualified consultants, acceptable to the Bank, financed out of
project resources.  Finally, there are oolitical risks.  These risks are
diminished in light of the broad political consensus that the neglected
water supply and sewerage sector urgently needs to reorient its policies
and practices. It is also minimized by the conformity between the project
objectives and the Government's policy to increase the efficiency of the
public sector and to improve public sector finances.  Moreover, the Menem
Administration, by further decentralizing OSN, has taken steps that support
the project objectives under the loan.
18.      Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan
