IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Loan/Credit and Project Summary
Borrower                           :  Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt
Beneficiaries                      :  Small-farm holders and the Irrigation
Department of the Ministry of Public
Works and Water Resources
Loan/Credit Amount                 :  IBRD Loan - US$26.7 millon equivalent
IDA Credit -SDR35.7 million
(US$53.3 million equivalent)
Terms                                  IBRD Loan - standard variable interest
rate for a term of 20 years, including 5
years of grace
IDA Credit - standard IDA for a term of
35 years, including 10 years of grace
Project Oblectives                 .  The overall objectives of the project are
to: (a) increase agricultural production
and farmers income by improving the
irrigation infrastructure, facilitating a
more equitable distribution of water, and
improved on-farm water management; (b)
improve the long-term sustainability,
through takeover of responsibility for
the operation and maintenance of the
tertiary level irrigation system by the
farmers and their sharing in the costs
for the tertiary level investments; and
(c) strengthen the institutional planning
and implementation capacity of MPWWR in
the irrigation subsector.
Proiect Description                :  The project comprises the improvement of
three irrigation command areas serving a
total net irrigable area of about 248,000
feddan. The subprojects are Mahmoudia
(131,000 fed) in Baheira Governorate;
Manaifa (42,000 fed); and El Wasat
(75,000 fed) in Kafr El-Sheikh
Governorate. Existing delivery system of
main and secondary canals will be
improved and provided with control
structures, telemetry system and mixing
stations installed for reuse of drainage
effluent. The tertiary systems will be
developed with provision of single lift
pumps, lined or pvc pipe tertiary
laterals. An irrigation advisory service
(IAS) will be established to assist with
organization and training of farmers into
Water Users Groups (WUGs) at tertiary
level and Water Users' Associations
(WUAs) at the secondary level.
Institutional support will be provided
through a communication component at the
Ministry and project levels, specialized



- ii -
services for monitoring and evaluation
(M&E), environmental aspects, on-farm
irrigation management demonstration
program and a training program both in-
country and overseas.
Environment                        .  The project has been placed in
Environmental screening Category "B"
consistent with O.D. 4.01. An
environmental mitigation plan would be
implemented to support institutional
strengthening and training, water quality
monitoring and agricultural chemical
management.
Poverty                            .  The project has been placed in poverty
category "PTI" as it will enhance the
income of over 70 percent of the project
beneficiaries withholding size less than
1.9 fed (0.8 ha) whose current farm
income is less than relative poverty line
and close to ultra-poverty line in Egypt.
Benefits                           :  The project would benefit about 95,000
families farming a net arable area of
about 248,000 fed. Production is
estimated to increase by 118,000 tons and
18,000 tons, respectively, for the major
crops of rice and wheat. The estimated
ERR is 25 percent.
Risks                              :  The major risks are: (i) the limited
implementation capacity of domestic
contractors which could reduce the area
improved and cause delays in project
implementation; and (ii) delay in design
of improvement works and procurement
processing. These risks would be
minimized by: (i) prequalification of
contractors and the provision of
technical assistance and training of
contractors and IIPD staff; and (ii)
advance actions on procurement and design
work using PHRD grant funds.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. The Economy
1.1     Egypt has the largest population (56 million people) and the
second largest economy in the Arab Middle East. Services, including
public administration, remain the most important sector, whose share in
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was about 51 percent in 1993. Next in
importance is industry, which accounts for 30 percent of GDP, while the
share of agriculture is 20 percent.
1.2     In the past, Egypt pursued a public-sector led and inward-looking
development strategy based on centralized ownership and a planned
economy. As a result, public enterprises (PEs) have played a dominant
role, accounting for about one half of total GDP. The Open Door Policy,
initiated in 1974, brought about a partial liberalization of the economy.
In 1990, the Government embarked on a bold and comprehensive economic
reform and structural adjustment program (ERSAP), which entails a shift
from a centrally planned economy with a relatively small private sector
to a decentralized, market- based and outward-oriented economy.
1.3     The Government has removed most non-tariff trade barriers, and
reduced the range of import tariffs to 5-70 percent, with the maximum
tariff expected to be cut to 50 percent by 1995; and tariffs on nearly
all capital goods were reduced to 5-10 percent. Requlatory reforms
implemented so far include the removal of obstacles to the entry and
operation of private firms, and streamlining of investment approvals and
procedures. With the objectives of subjecting public enterprises to
market forces, and privatization, PEs were reorganized into 17
diversified, financially autonomous holding companies, and divorced from
the fiscal budget in terms of investment financing and credit guarantees.
In the financial sector, Egyptian authorities are replacing restrictive
regulations with international standards of prudential regulation. To
minimize the negative impact of reform measures on vulnerable groups, the
US$600 million Social Fund for Development was established in 1991.
B. Agriculture in the Economy
1.4     Agriculture remains an important sector within the Egyptian
economy; it employs about 35 percent of the labor force and accounts for
around 20 percent of GDP and merchandise exports. The agricultural land
base is 7.5 million feddans, and the agricultural labor force is
estimated at 4.4 million. With only three percent of the land area being
arable, holdings average less than 0.8 ha, one of the lowest in the
world. The very productive land, particularly in the Delta, is
intensively cultivated. Given its agro-climatic conditions and proximity
to major markets, Egypt has the potential to attain significant growth in
output and income through technology transfer, provision of essential
support services to farmers, and the development of post harvest
technology and marketing services. The most limiting resource for
Egyptian agriculture is irrigation water.
1.5     Until the mid 1980s, the policy framework in agriculture was
inward-looking and import-substitution oriented, and was characterized by
heavy Government intervention in production, pricing, trade and marketing
of major crops and inputs. Beginning in 1986, and in line with its
strategy for the 1980s, the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation
(MALR) pioneered a bold reform program; the main measures implemented so
far are: (a) removal of crop area allotments, delivery quotas, and



- 2 -
producer prices (cotton prices and marketing have to a large extent been
liberalized); (b) removal of input subsidies for feed and fertilizers;
(c) privatization of fertilizer distribution; (d) the raising of
pesticides lending rates closer to commercial banking levels;(e)sale of
state-owned new lands to the private sector; (g)offering for sale of 83
agricultural production projects, of which 18 have been sold; (h) raising
land rents three-fold during a transitional period after which they would
be liberalized and become market determined; (i) liberalization of trade
of most agricultural commodities and capital goods (cotton trade was
recently freed subject to some restrictions); and (j) the proposed
liberalization of the sugar subsector in 1995. With the implementation of
these measures, the agriculture sector would be largely liberalized and
major distortions removed, with the exception of water resources.
1.6     The Bank and USAID have been in dialogue with GOE on the issue of
the adoption of a financially sustainable program for maintaining the
irrigation and drainage network. A three-phase study has been
undertaken, and tertiary level cost sharing arrangements have been
legalized based on the first two phases. The third phase will include
options and instruments to be used system-wide. Further dialogue will
continue on the basis of recommendations and conclusion of phase three.
Measures are still needed for the more, efficient use of the sector's
single most important limiting resource, water. Therefore, improvement
in on-farm irrigation efficiency is a major strategic objective, as is
the introduction of the notion of cost sharing to improve the financial
burden of operating and maintaining the system. Government has recently
passed legislation which would enable the establishment of water users'
groups (WUGs), and the recovery of capital and operation and maintenance
costs of on-farm irrigation improvements. Moreover, the Ministry of
Public Works and Water Resources (MPWWR) will launch in November 1994 a
study on sharing the operation, rehabilitation, and maintenance costs of
the irrigation network (storage, delivery, and distribution of water).
Beyond the on-farm tertiary system future policies pertaining to cost
sharing for the operation and maintenance of the entire system are
expected to be based on the findings and recommendations of the study.
The Bank is in dialogue with Government to develop an appropriate
strategy and program for this purpose.
C. Irrigation and Drainage
Nile Irrigation System
1.7     The present irrigation system has evolved since the construction
of the Nile barrages and irrigation canals in 1861. Extending some 1,200
Km. from Aswan to the Mediterranean Sea, the system consists of two
storage dams at Aswan, seven major barrages on the Nile, which divert
water into canals, and over 31,000 km of irrigation canals serving the
agricultural lands. The system is expanding to serve the needs of newly
reclaimed lands. Some 0.9 million fed of irrigated land are at higher
elevations, served by 516 pumping stations.
1.8     The canal system is operated and maintained by the Irrigation
Department of MPWWR. The Ministry's Mechanical and Electrical Department
(MED) maintains the pumping facilities. The canals deliver water into
"meskas", which are channels serving 100 to 500 fed. Meskas, in turn,
feed "marwas", which are farm ditches serving 10 to 100 fed. The meska
and marwa systems are owned, operated and maintained by farmers.
1.9     The Nile is unique as the water source is external to Egypt and
is controlled at a single point, Aswan. Water distribution and farm use
occurs within a complex framework of rotation based on a canal system,
coupled with rotation among farmers at the meska level. Typically,



farmers in historically cultivated old lands receive water in the meskas
one-half meter below the elevation of their fields and pump it into their
marwas.
Irrigation/Drainage Constraints
1.10    Irrigation.  The most pressing problems confronting the
irrigation system are the limited control provided by canal structures,
many of which are only partially functional, inadequate systems
operations, and inequitable distribution of water at the tertiary level
with 70 percent of farmers at the tail-ends receiving very little water.
With assistance from USAID, MPWWR has undertaken to address these
problems through the rehabilitation or replacement of deteriorated
structures throughout the canal system. The Structures Improvement
Program began in 1982 and is scheduled for completion by 1995. In
addition, the project has several other components to strengthen
operation and maintenance, planning and research activities as well as
irrigation improvement (IIP) of the delivery system and development of
tertiary system (meska). The pilot program of IIP for about 120,000 fed
spread over six governorates, is expected to be completed by September
1995.
1.11    Drainage.  In areas with no sub-surface drainage, open drains
still operate in their original form to maintain the water level 1.5 m
below the ground. The large spacing of open drains and the absence of
field drains limit the capability of drains to affect the water table
significantly. Thus, continuous and expanding irrigation has resulted in
a gradual rise in the groundwater table, bringing with it water logging
and increased salinity in most areas that do not have subsurface drainage
to control water table depth. Surveys in 1984 and 1990 covering about 2
million fed determined that waterlogging is widespread throughout the
northern parts of the Delta and in some scattered areas in Middle and
Upper Egypt. Thus, the Government of Egypt (GOE) has accorded high
priority to reducing the groundwater and salinity problems by installing
subsurface drainage systems.
1.12    Maintenance of Canals and Open Drains.  Climatic conditions and
low water turbidity encourage profuse weed growth in open channels, which
total about 47,000 km. Maintenance standards and techniques are being
addressed under a separate coordinated program supported by the World
Bank, USAID and the Government of the Netherlands. The maintenance
program aims at introducing appropriate and cost-effective practices for
canals and open drains throughout the system.
D. Bank GrouR Financing and Proiect Origin
Bank/IDA Lending
1.13    The Bank Group's involvement with drainage in Egypt was initiated
in 1970 under the Nile Delta Drainage I Project (Credit 181-UAR). That
project improved the drainage on 950,000 fed. Subsequently, five more
projects were approved for drainage implementation: the Upper Egypt I
(Credit 393-UAR), the Upper Egypt II (Credit/Loan 637/1285-EGT), the Nile
Delta II (Credit/Loan 719/1439/40-EGT), Drainage V (Loan 2562-EGT),
National Drainage Project (Ln 3417/Cr. 2313-EGT). IDA/Bank financing for
the drainage program has totalled US$ 358 million. The total area
covered by Bank Group supported projects is 3.26 million fed for open
drains and 3.24 million fed for pipe drains. In addition, the first
pumping stations rehabilitation project financed the construction of 22
new pump stations and the rehabilitation of 2 existing stations.
1.14    Other Bank financed projects in irrigation and drainage include
the recently closed Channel Maintenance Project (Ln 2732-EGT for US $ 45
million) and two Irrigation Pumping Station Rehabilitation Projects:



- 4 -
Pumping Stations I (Ln. 2270-EGT for US$41.5 million) and on-going
Pumping Station II (Ln 3198-EGT for US $ 31 million).
Lessons Learned.
1.15    Much has been learned about the problems of the subsector during
the Bank's long and substantial involvement with drainage, channel
maintenance the two pumping stations rehabilitation projects. The first
five drainage projects and first pumping station rehabilitation project
experienced implementation delays of two to three years, primarily due to
delayed effectiveness and overly optimistic implementation schedules.
The principal PPAR findings for these projects are: (a) the
implementation period should consider delaying factors, such as the
lengthy periods required for procurement, and the civil works schedules
should be based on a more realistic implementation capacity; and (b)
technical assistance should be sought from bilateral grant sources as the
Government is reluctant to use loan funds for consultants.
1.16    USAID recently carried out a detailed evaluation of its pilot
program for Irrigation Improvement Project in November 1993. The purpose
of the evaluation was to assess the progress, evaluate the effectiveness
and provide guidance for more effective implementation activities. The
assessment indicates that the project is continuing to achieve its goals,
purpose and objectives satisfactorily but has not reached its ambitious
level of planned output. The specific findings and recommendations of
the evaluation are: (a) to promote sustainability, cost sharing program
with farmers is essential; (b) there is a lack of staff to accomplish
project goals; (c) tripartite coordination between the farmers,
Irrigation Advisory Service (IAS) and agriculture extension for
improvement of water conservation and yield is lacking; and (d) the
construction program is behind schedule mainly due to late start and lack
of experience of construction contractors, which requires proper
selection and close supervision of contracts.
Prolect Origin
1.17    The GOE has requested further Bank Group support to improve three
irrigation systems in an area of about 250,000 feddan located in Kafer El
Sheikh and Baheira Governorates in the Delta. Improvements will include
introduction of continuous flow, construction of control structures in
the main and secondary canals and development of tertiary system by
raising tertiary laterals to be fed by a single lift pump. These
improvements are based on the experience gained in the on-going
improvement program undertaken on a pilot scale in six Governorates
through USAID assistance.
1.18    The Irrigation Improvement Project Directorate (IIPD) of the
MPWWR prepared an identification report covering about 0.5 million feddan
area, which was reviewed by a Bank mission in October 1993. The mission
recommended three areas covering a total of 250,000 feddan for detailed
feasibility studies. The feasibility study was carried out by IIPD and
the Project Preparation Department (PPD) of MPWWR. IIPD and PPD produced
a six volume comprehensive report in April 1994 which formed the basis of
the Bank's pre-appraisal mission in June/July 1994.
1.19    Rationale for Bank/IDA Involvement.  Bank assistance strategy in
Egypt accords high priority to financing projects which focus on
environmental and sustainability issues and on poverty alleviation. As
pointed out in the Environmental Action Plan Report for Egypt, the supply
of water from the Nile River is limited, the only way to meet the
increased demand is by conservation through more efficient use by
agriculture. The Government's environmental strategy gives the highest



priority to conserving water resources. The Agriculture Sector Strategy'
has underscored the importance of increasing the efficiency of water use
and reliability of water services as an important objective. In
conformity with the Country Assistance Strategy, the project would
address these concerns. The project would mainly benefit small holder
communities with average land holding below 3 feddan (1.3 ha). With use
and timely availability of better quality water, farmers' income will
increase. This being the first large-scale tertiary system improvement,
it will have significant replication potential for 6 million feddans
currently under irrigated agriculture in Egypt. Through the project, the
Bank would play an important role by assisting the Government in
promoting water use efficiency and energy saving measures. The
Government also looks to the Bank to provide technical leadership in
designing a long-term irrigation improvement program. The Bank can play
a positive role similar to that of the drainage program which has been
under implementation over the past 20 years.
II. The Proiect Area
A. Physical Characteristics
Location. Climate and Soil
2.1    Location and Climate.  The overall net project area of 248,000
feddan is composed of three subproject areas: Mahmoudia (131,000 feddan)
in Baheira Governorate; El Wasat (75,000 feddan) in Kafr El-Sheikh
Governorate; and Munaifa (42,000 feddan) also in Kafr El-Sheikh
Governorate. Climatic conditions in all three subprojects are similar.
Temperatures range from a low 60C to a high of 380C. Average annual
rainfall is about 150 mm. Relative humidity for the three subproject
areas ranges from a low of 57 percent in May to a high of 75 percent in
January. Average daily sunshine hours ranges between a low of 6.2 hours
in January to a high of 11.7 hours in June.
2.2    Soils.  The soils in the three subproject areas are alluvial,
formed from sediment deposited by the River Nile during the annual
floods. They are made up of silty clay loams of black to brown color;
with land having moderate to insignificant slopes. The hydraulic
conductivity is less than 0.1 m/hour in the soil surface, which gradually
increases to a maximum of 1.0 m/hour in the subsoil. A large part of the
area where subsurface drainage has not yet been installed (about 40
percent) has a water table about 90 cm below the ground surface.
Population. Land Tenure and Farm Sizes
2.3    Number of beneficiaries, land tenure and farm sizes in percent of
each subproject are detailed in Annex 1, Table 2 and summarized below in
Table 2.1.

2.4         Farming Systems and Land Use.  Farming systems are quite similar
in the three sub-project areas; almost without exception farmers grow two

Bank Country Study, February 1993.



- 6 -
crops a year on the same piece of land. Their land use strategy gives
priority to subsistence crops such as wheat(as a winter crop) and rice (as a
summer subsistence and land reclamation crop) and to fodder crops such as
beseem and maize. The most important cash crops include cotton and winter and
summer vegetables. Livestock is an integral part of most farming operations;
buffalo, cattle, donkeys and some small ruminants are raised in almost all
farmns. Livestock provide animal products for the nutrition of the family, at
the same time providing manure for the soil, traction and transport for on-
farm work, while constituting the bulk of the family savings and source of
financial liquidity.
2.5         Percentage of area cultivated with various crops in both winter
and summer season for three subprojects is given in Annex I, Table 1 and
summarized in Table 2.2.

2.6         Crop Yields in the three sub-project areas are generally low
relative to national levels. In farms located at the upstream parts of main
canals and tertiaries (Meskas), yields levels are not at their highest
potential because: (i) farmers tend to over-irrigate when water availability
is generally unreliable; and (ii) because of shortcomings in certain cultural
practices, such as poor land levelling, inadequate irrigation timing and pest
control. In farms located at the tail ends of canals and Meskas, yields are
depressed because of: (i) the lack of sufficient irrigation water (which is
wasted for over-irrigation by farmers upstream) or of delays in obtaining the
water, (ii) use of low quality drainage water in lieu of fresh water and (iii)
inadequate cultural practices used by farmers.
2.7         Even for those farmers who are not experiencing water shortages,
yields are generally lower than the average yields of major crops in Egypt.
As indicated in the "Review of the USAID-supported National Agricultural
Research Project", national average yields of major crops are quite high; they
are 27 percent higher than the highest average yield for rice at El Wasat (6
t/ha), 13 percent higher than those of maize at Manaifa (5.7 t/ha), 24 percent
higher than those of wheat at Mahmoudia (5 t/ha) and 36 percent higher than
the yield of cotton (2.1 t/ha) in all three sub-project areas (Annex 1, Table
1, pages 1, 2 and 3). Yields of farmers whose land is located at the tail end
of Meskas or of larger canals are even lower than the above yields. Surveys
conducted by the MPWWR and confirmed by mission's observations in the field,
indicate that yields of tail-end farmers are 10 to 20 percent lower than those
of upstream farmers for winter crops and 30 to 40 percent lower for summer



crops. Inequity in water distribution curtails yields not only by limiting the
amount of water crops receive but also by delaying their establishment and
growth.
B. Agricultural Institutions and Services
2.8         Agricultural Institutions.  Support to agricultural production in
the three sub-project areas is provided mainly through the Agricultural
Cooperatives (AC) and the extension network of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Land Reclamation (MALR). The extension network is backed by a number of
specialized research institutes that operate under the umbrella of the
Agricultural Research Center (ARC) of MALR. In addition to technical support,
farmers receive credit from the ACs, the Principal Bank for Development and
Agricultural Credit (PBDAC), informal sources and, to a lesser extent, from
commercial banks.
2.9         Agricultural Research is the responsibility of ARC.  It is
mandated to generate and transfer in collaboration with extension services
technological improvements to farmers. The ARC operates through multi-
disciplinary teams conducting on-station and on-farm research. It has 17
research institutes, including the Soil and Water Research Institute (SWRI),
which is mandated to conduct research and transfer technologies related to on-
farm irrigation and water management. The SWRI has a well equipped and active
soil and water research laboratory at the Sakha station near Kafr El Sheikh,
where the Manaifa and El Wasat sub-project areas are located. The SWRI deals
in its stations and through on-farm applied research with studies related to
physical and chemical properties of soils, plant nutrition, irrigation
agronomy and drainage; it has also developed appropriate technologies in on-
farm irrigation management.
2.10        Agricultural Extension. The Village Extension Workers (VEW) have
the closest and most direct link with farmers. Their expertise has so far
been limited to crop management and production techniques, with little or no
knowledge of irrigation and on-farm irrigation management techniques. This
shortfall is however, being addressed through special and on-the-job training
in the context of pilot projects and programs aimed at improving on-farm water
use efficiency. VEW are supported in the field by assistants, who are
supposed to cover farmers in 200 feddan blocks. At the regional level, VEW
receives back-stopping from regional extension and technical subject matter
specialists. Experience gained through the USAID supported Small Farmer
Production Project indicates that collaborative efforts between extension and
other specialized institutes or projects was effective in disseminating new
technologies and in raising productivity. Such an approach could be used to
combine the resources of extension and those of institutes such as the SWRI of
MALR and the Water Research Institute (WRI) of MPWWR to disseminate and assist
farmers in adopting efficient on-farm irrigation management techniques.
2.11        Agricultural Cooperatives and Credit Institutions.  Agricultural
cooperatives have become widespread, largely through government support and
patronage. Their present function is essentially to provide inputs, either
for cash or on credit, and to market, at the request of their members, major
agricultural products such as wheat, cotton and rice. Because of their past
dynamism, some Acs continue to be a meeting place for farmers. VEWs have used
these cooperatives as an interface to disseminate agricultural information.
Because of their modest financial resources, Acs have not been major players
in the field of farm credit. To serve their members and provide them with
seasonal credit, some cooperatives have had to act as agents for PBDAC or
other commercial banks.
2.12        Credit extended by PBDAC is by far the most important source of
formal agricultural credit. PBDAC operates through 17 Governorate level
banks, 154 district branches, 804 village banks and some 4,000 village level
agents providing short term seasonal credit as well as medium and long term
investment credit. Notwithstanding the active role played by PBDAC in



- 8 -
providing credit, much of the agricultural finance is raised by producers from
their own savings or from friends, relatives or suppliers. There are rotating
savings groups as well as trusted individuals who hold savings particularly
from foreign remittances. No data are available to quantify the significance
of these informal sources.
C. Existing Irrigation and Drainage System
General
2.13        The key feature of old irrigation systems in the Nile Valley and
the Delta is that the irrigation channels are below field level and farmers
have had to pump water to their fields using the traditional animal-driven
water wheels (sakias), and, recently, mobile diesel-driven pumps. This
situation requires less precise water-level control and tends to limit over-
irrigation by farmers. However, there are still considerable losses through
tail escapes and some over irrigation occurs. The main canals are operated
under continuous flow and upstream control. The secondary and tertiary canals
are operated on a seasonably adjusted rotation schedule.
2.14        As long as animal driven wheels were small, there were few
operational problems and farmers enjoyed a flexible water supply at times when
water in their tertiary channel was flowing. As farmers began to use larger
pumps, and as water became scarcer, problems such as water shortage and
inequitable water availability appeared at the tail end. To address these
issues the Government is implementing a pilot project of Irrigation
Improvement in six Governorates with USAID assistance. The concepts
introduced in the pilot project are continuous flow (on-demand) system at the
secondary and tertiary level with downstream control. Tertiary canals are
being raised, buried pipelines for distribution of water installed, and
individual pumps replaced with single point pumps to improve operations and
reduce pumping costs. As a part of the pilot project, an Irrigation Advisory
Service has been established to organize water users at the tertiary level. A
systematic participatory procedure has evolved to initiate and strengthen
water users' organizations which will assume full financial and operational
responsibility for the tertiary (meska) including single lift pumps. A similar
concept will be used under the project for the three sub-project areas.
Water Resources
2.15        Water is supplied to the Mahmoudia subproiect from the Mahmoudia
canal which serves a total net irrigable area of about 246,000 fed. The
subproject area of about 131,000 fed is located between Km 15 and 44 of
Mahmoudia Canal and is serviced by 23 secondary canals (320 km length). For
the Manaifa subproject, the source of water is El Bagouria main canal with El
Kadabba Canal (18 km long) conveying the water to the area through 24
secondary canals (150 km length). The El-Wasat Subproject receives its
irrigation water from the Bahr Sebeen Canal which is fed by the Meet Yazeed
Canal. The water is distributed to the area through 29 secondary canals (210
km length). For more details on the irrigation and drainage, see Annex I.
Water Reguirements and Balance
2.16        General.  Water is delivered to the area under conventional
rotation system of four days on the rice cultivated areas during summer with
doubling of off days (8 to 10 days) for the non-rice areas both during summer
and winter. The water requirement is calculated by the field engineers of
MPWWR on the basis of previous year cropping patterns. However, the farmers
significantly deviate from the proposed cropping pattern and cultivate more
rice, which consumes a maximum amount of water. Because of this variation and
differences of water delivery efficiencies there is inequitable sharing of
available water resources between the upper and tail-end water users during
peak demand periods. In general, the quantity delivered does not satisfy the
demand, so the deficit is met by the farmers pumping directly from nearby high



- 9 -
salinity-content drains. In this case, no mixing occurs, which is detrimental
both to the soil and the crops.
2.17        Water Requirements.  The monthly flows for ten day intervals for
various crops using the modified Penman method (coefficient developed
according to soil and climatic conditions in Egypt at various stages of
growth) were calculated for conditions with and without the project, using an
overall irrigation efficiency of about 50 percent without project and about 60
percent with project. With-project estimates are considered conservative as
the demonstration efforts of on-farm irrigation management will improve farm
application efficiency which is assumed as 75 percent against 70 percent
without the project. A summary of diversion requirements, mean annual flows
delivered in these sub-areas during years 1990 to 1993 (for both with and
without conditions) and the deficit is given in Annex I, Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6,
which shows an annual deficit without project of 750 MCM, 133 MCM, and 125 MCM
respectively for Mahmoudia (total area of 248,000 fed), Manaifa and El-Wasat
subprojects. The deficit currently is met by using drainage effluent without
mixing it with fresh water, which is detrimental to the soils. The deficit
with the project will be less because of overall irrigation efficiency
improvement which will amount to 683 MCM, 74 MCM and 35 MCM, respectively, for
Mahmoudia, Manaifa and El Wasat subprojects. June and July are peak deficit
months. Total water use as a result of the project will be lower than it is
at present.
2.18        Water Balance. Each subproject was analyzed carefully in terms of
irrigation water deficit and monthly availability of drainage water in various
nearby drains at the proposed mixing pump stations. The analysis clearly
showed that with the project, the deficit can be adequately met after allowing
for drainage reuse (see Annex 1, Tables 3, 4 and 5).
2.19        For the Mahmoudia subproject, a third pumping station at El Atf is
expected to be completed by the end of 1995 which will solve the water
deficit. In case of Manaifa area, which has the maximum deficit, a new
pumping station on the River Nile is under construction at the intake of the
Behr El-Saidi Canal which is expected to be in operation within a year. A
part of the Kuddaba feeder canal service area will be shifted to the command
of the new station, so this will relieve part of the shortage in the peak
months. In addition, two new mixing stations are proposed under the project
which would satisfy the remaining deficit. El Wasat Subproject deficit will
be met by reuse of drainage water through proposed reuse pumping stations on
drains No. 7 and 8.
D. Cost Recovery
2.20        Background. Egypt has no history of charging for water.  Major
facilities such as dams, barrages, levees, pumping stations, main canals and
drains, have been funded and maintained under the Government budget. In
respect of irrigation, farmers have traditionally maintained the meska, and in
most areas have to lift water from the meska to their fields. The latter cost
is not insignificant and has provided an incentive for moderating on-farm
water use.
2.21        Cost Recovery from farmers has been through the land tax and,
indirectly, through the trading and procurement system. Land tax rates have
eroded greatly over time and this tax is not now a significant expense. In
contrast, implicit levies via the trade and procurement system have often been
substantial and in most years have probably exceeded the real costs of input
subsidies, including those of water. They have, however, led to distortions in
incentives and have the target of economic and sectorial reform. As a result
of economic reform and market liberalization (para. 1.3), prices are
increasingly approximating international parity levels, leaving water as the
only major remaining subsidized input. Given also that Egypt is approaching--
and in drought years may exceed--the limits of its renewable water supply, the
question of demand inevitably arises. The Bank and other donors (principally



- 10 -
USAID) have been in dialogue with the Government over several years on the
issue of cost recovery, demand and supply management. Some progress has
recently been made.
2.22        First, Irrigation Law No. 12 of 1984 has been amended to clarify
and consolidate farmer obligations in respect of both capital repayment and
O&M of the tertiary system (capital repayment following the precedent for on-
farm drainage works). Second, studies are being undertaken with USAID
assistance to assess alternatives with respect to the main water delivery
system. And third, a public awareness program is being launched, supported
under the project, inter alia to increase public and farmer awareness of water
scarcity and of the importance of reflecting the economic value of water in
public and private decisions. Together, these measures represent a major step
forward and a significant departure from past practice.
2.23        The steps proposed above in Egypt are comparable, and in case of
recovery of investment cost for the tertiary development (without interest)
surpass the success in other member countries.  In the Philippines, the
management of the communal systems (less than 1000 ha) has been transferred to
farmer organizations. In the National Irrigation Systems, where areas are
above 1000 ha, the recovery rate is approaching two-thirds of the total O&M
costs. In Indonesia, efforts are currently underway to recover service fees
from small scale systems. Latin America has been more successful in cost
recovery where responsibility for O&M has been transferred to users
organizations. Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Colombia are attempting a number
of institutional reforms to combine cost recovery with programs by which users
manage parts of the irrigation system. In some case, 100 percent of O&M costs
are being recovered. In general, recovery of investment cost is another story
and progress in that direction is slow.
2.24        Egypt's policy of cost sharing arrangements including promotion of
Meska management of WUGs is a major step forward. Moreover, recent OED
reviews have stressed the need to combine cost recovery efforts with
improvements in water service and involvement of users organizations. The IIP
will improve service reliability and equity through tertiary and main system
improvements. As the international experience shows, successful performance
of user organizations depend on intensive training, extension, and technical
support, considerable resources have been allocated to the formation and
strengthening of water user organizations.

B. Detailed Features
General
3.3         Detailed feature of each component are given in Annex II.  Below
is a summary of provisions under the project.
3.4         General ImRrovement of Delivery System (Base Cost US$20.1
million). The project will provide for the improvement of main and secondary
canal eroded sections, replacement of existing deteriorated structures such as
bridges, installation of automatic downstream control gates and upstream cross
regulators as control structures, modular distribution structures as the head
regulators of secondary canals linked with the centralized controlled
telemetry system in Baheira and Kafr El-Sheikh Governorates. The water supply
deficit will be met by using the drainage effluent through mixing with fresh
water at predetermined levels in reuse mixing pump stations. Each reuse
mixing station will be equipped with automatic gauges to ensure that the
salinity of mixed water will not exceed the tolerance of salinity for the
crops using the mixed flow (600 PPM for the rice crop). The project would
also provide for small pump stations to intercept the surface drainage flow
from rice paddies (draining of paddy fields at regular interval, a local
practice in Egypt) and pump it directly to the nearest secondary or tertiary
canal for reuse.



- 13 -
3.5         Tertiary System Development (Base Cost USS96.2 million).  The
project will provide for single lift pumps of 60 to 120 litre/sec capacity,
with an average lift of 2 to 3 m at the intake of each tertiary lateral to
replace the multiple lift pumps at each quaternary. The tertiary laterals
will be improved through the provision of either a lined section
(prefabricated J section) or low pressure buried PVC pipes with alfalfa valves
for release of water to the farms or quaternary laterals. Provision is also
made to implement a few tertiary laterals using in-place concrete lining with
lining machines on a trial basis. About 1,000 km of J-sections for 1,100
tertiary blocks and 1,500 km of PVC pipe laterals for 1,600 tertiary blocks
are expected to be provided under the project.
3.6         Irrigation Advisory Service (IAS) - (Base Cost US$5.3 Million).
The concept of Irrigation Advisory Service (IAS) was introduced under the
ongoing USAID assisted pilot project. IAS teams consisting of staff with
engineering and community organization skills were established to organize
water users' groups (WUGs) and train the farmers in the operation and
maintenance of tertiary laterals and on the financial management including
procedures for WUG members to make regular payments based on hours of pumping
for the use of water. Currently there are loose groups of water users in some
tertiary blocks. However, such groups do not have a legal basis and need
training to function effectively.
3.7          The IAS concept will be extended to the project area to provide:
(a) information and technical support for maintenance/repairs of laterals and
for replacement/repairs of pumps; (b) training in financial management
including procedures for charging WUG members on a time basis for the use of
water and ensuring cost recovery for maintenance of laterals, operation and
repair cost of pumps; and the long-term replacement cost of pumps. Command
area centers covering areas of about 6,000 to 10,000 fed would be created.
Each center will have a common facility of 25Om2area for the operation of IAS.
In addition to these centers, Water Users' Associations (WUAs) will be
established covering about 3000 to 5000 fed areas according to the service
areas of secondary canals (branches and sub-branches). The idea of centers
and WUAs is new and was not used under the ongoing USAID assisted pilot
project. WUAs would address inter-meska problems, coordinate water management
problems with IAS and provide assistance in linking farmers with private pump
manufacturers and mechanics. Each WUG will be represented in the WUA by an
elected representative. IAS staffing is given in para. 4.6 and Annex II,
Table 1. About 2650 WUGs and 67 WUAs will be organized under the project over
the seven-year implementation period.
3.8         Institutional Support (Base Cost USS9.8 Million).  Institutional
support will be provided through various bilateral assistance arrangements.
Because of these arrangements and the special request of KfW, the support is
divided into three subcomponents. The first one is for the design and
construction supervision. The second is for technical assistance for various
components such as environment, M&E of a few well defined key indicators, on-
farm irrigation management, communication, cost sharing studies and IAS. The
third is the training aspect which would include an initial detailed study to
define and identify various needs of in-country training composed of on-the-
job training, workshops and seminars and overseas training including
fellowships for graduate studies in various fields closely connected with the
project components. The operational support for each component would also
include incentives to be given to project staff in the form of allowances and
per diem, etc. All requirements of technical assistance, staffing and
training are given in Annex II, Table 2, and 4 and summarized in Table 3.1.

monitoring equipment, technical assistance in the specialized fields of reuse
of drainage effluent and management of agro-chemicals. The project would also
provide for in-country workshops/seminars, overseas training and visits.
Requirements for the staffing, technical assistance and training are
summarized in Annex II, Tables 2, 4 and 6.
3.10    On-farm Irrigation Management Demonstration Program (Base Cost USS1.6
million). The project would support the establishment of about 50
demonstrations spread over three subprojects during seven years of project
implementation. It is expected that adoption of proven technologies would:
(a) improve agricultural production; and (b) improve the water use efficiency.
The project would finance 80 percent cost of land levelling (about 2,300 fed
over seven years), soil amendment and production inputs, irrigation management
and laboratory equipment. Provision would also be made for technical
assistance and training of participating staff. Requirements for the on-farm
water management demonstration program is summarized in Annex II, Tables 2, 4,
and 6.
3.11        Communication - (Base Cost USS3.3 Million).  This project
component is subdivided into two subcomponents. One, at the Ministry level,
is aimed at the general public, legislators and policymakers, and the
engineers in the Ministry to build awareness and action on the scarcity of the
water resources and the need to conserve. The other subcomponent is project
specific and aimed at the project area farmers. For both subcomponents the
project would provide for vehicles, communication and office equipment,
training materials in Arabic, services for communication experts, editors, in
country workshops/seminars, overseas visits by policymakers and managers, and
funds required for awareness campaigns through various types of mass media
coverage. Requirements for this component are summarized in Annex II, Tables
2,4, 7 and 8.
Status of Proiect Preparation
3.12        During the Bank group identification mission that visited Egypt in
October 1993, three subproject areas were selected from a total area of about
0.5 million fed proposed by the MPWWR. Priority in the selection was given to
the availability of water resources, minimum investment required in the
improvement of the diversion and main canal system, a well defined program of
drainage improvement (either completed, on-going under existing programs or
planned for completion before the year 2000), nearby location of areas
completed under USAID assisted project and of minimum environmental issues, or
such issues where the project could make a positive impact. MPWWR completed a
detailed feasibility study for the agreed three subproject areas in April
1994. This report formed the basis of the Bank group's preappraisal in
June/July 1994. The appraisal was conducted in October 1994.
3.13        The preappraisal mission and IIPD jointly selected areas in each
subproject which would be implemented during the initial two years (1996 and
1997). MPWWR has assigned the field staff in two field offices and detailed
field surveys were initiated on July 15, 1994. Two separate design sections



- 15 -
have been established in each of the two field offices. The first section
will deal with design of works and preparation of tender documents for the
delivery system i.e. main and secondary canals, telemetry system and drainage
reuse pump stations. The second section will deal with the design of tertiary
development including single lift pump stations. The Bank Group's standard
bidding documents will be used for works and goods to be procured under the
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. The detailed designs for
first year works are expected to be ready by mid-December 1994 and for the
second year works will be ready by mid-May 1995. The Government has received a
grant of US$0.5 million from the Japanese program policy for Human Resources
Development (PHRD) which is being used for consultants for assisting the MPWWR
to organize WUGs, complete tender documents and focus on awareness campaign.
Consultants, have been mobilized and are assisting IIPD staff in finalizing
the tender documents, and particularly also the preparation of special
provisions and technical specifications for equipment as well as works which
are expected to be awarded soon after the effectiveness of the IDA/Bank credit
and loan. IIPD is proceeding with prequalification of civil works contractors
(para. 4.9) and advertised in November 1994 the processing of tenders (three
tenders for equipment and five tenders in three subprojects for civil works).
The bids for these tenders would be evaluated and would be ready for award by
July/August 1995 which is about two months after expected effectiveness of
credit/loan (May/June 1995).
C. Proiect Costs and Financing Plan
Project Costs
3.14        Total project cost is estimated at about LE 619.9 million
(US$182.3 million) with US$94.7 millon or 52 percent in foreign exchange.
Project costs were based on detailed field surveys of main and secondary
canals and inventory of structures and their condition. Quantities and unit
rates for major items were determined according to similar works under the
current ongoing contracts of works financed under USAID assistance. The
contractors pay taxes and duties ranging from between 3-7 percent for civil
works and a custom duty of 8-12 percent is imposed on imported equipment.
This is reflected in the unit rates. All costs are based on prices indexed to
December 1994. Physical contingency factors were based on the degree of
preparation and the firmness of details available as follows: 15 percent for
the main and secondary delivery system; 10 percent for building facilities and
for technical assistance; 15 percent for the tertiary system development.   No
physical contingency was applied to incremental staff, technical assistance
for specialized studies, office facilities or vehicles. Costs due to expected
price increases over the implementation period amount to about 15.4 percent of
the base cost, plus physical contingencies on the basis of the following
annual inflation rates.

FinancinQ Plan
3.16        The Government has requested assistance from the Federal Republic
of Germany through KfW, and from the Netherlands through Netherlands
Directorate General of International Cooperation (NDGIC). KfW is expected to
provide financing of about DM 70.0 million (equivalent US$44.9 million) a part
of which will be a grant. The grant funds will be used to cover both the
local and foreign expenditures related to the consultancy services,
operational support, and training required for Irrigation Advisory Service,
On-farm Irrigation Management and monitoring and evaluation of the project
activities. The loan portion of KfW financing would finance foreign and local
expenditure for consultancy services, operational support, and training
required for design, and construction supervision to implement the project and
foreign exchange costs of gates for the delivery system and a portion of local
costs related to civil works contracts. NDGIC is expected to provide a grant
of about DFL 6.5 million (equivalent US$3.7 millon) through its bilateral
assistance program. NDGIC financing would cover all of the foreign exchange
and most of the local cost requirements for technical assistance and training
for the communication at the Ministry level and environmental component. Both
KFW and NOGIC has confirmed their commitment to the financing of components
and joined project appraisal. KfW participated in the negotiations for the
Bank Group financing components. The cofinancing would be on a parallel
basis. A tentative financing plan for various components is shown in Annex
IV, Table 1.
3.17        In view of the budgetary constraints, the Government has requested
assistance in financing local expenditures; the cofinanciers and the Bank/IDA
propose to finance some of the local expenditures on a declining basis. The
proposed Bank loan of US$26.7 million and the IDA credit of SDR 35.7 million
(equivalent US$53.3 million)would finance about 46 percent of the project
cost, net of duties and taxes; this would meet about 60.0 percent of the
foreign costs and 27 percent of local costs; the contribution from other
cofinanciers would meet the remaining 40 percent of foreign costs and about 12
percent of local costs. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table
3.3. The Government would meet 61 percent of local costs, most of which are
the incremental recurrent cost taxes and import duties.

D. Procurement
3.18        Procurement arrangements for the components to be financed by the
Bank group and other cofinanciers are summarized in Annex IV, Table 1. Each of
the cofinanciers will have its own procurement requirements; only the total
amount is defined. The proposed equipment and civil works tender processing
and completion schedules are shown in Annex IV, Table 2. Procurement for all
items under the project would be carried out by IIPD. A separate unit will be
established to handle construction and procurement activities (para. 4.5).
Staff experienced in procurement under USAID financed project, and other Bank
assisted projects will be assigned, as required, to this unit.
3.19        All equipment and materials to be financed from the IDA credit and
the Bank loan proceeds would be procured in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines. Egyptian manufacturers competing under International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of
the CIF price or the prevailing custom duty applicable to non-exempt
importers, whichever is less, provided they can prove that the value added to
the product in Egypt exceeds 20 percent of the ex-factory bid price.
Consulting services, if any, to be financed from the loan/credit proceeds
would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants.  Except for contracts for consulting firms costing less than
US$100,000 and for individuals costing less than US$50,000, all documents
relating to the procurement of consulting services to be financed from the IDA
credit or the Bank loan proceeds would be subject to the Bank group's prior
review. Consultants for technical assistance would be engaged according to the
procedures and guidelines of the agency financing this component; terms of
reference and selection of such consultants would, however, be subject to the
Bank Group's concurrence.
Eauipment and Materials
3.20        For Bank Group financed components, ICB procedures in accordance
with Bank Procurement Guidelines would be used for the procurement of pumping
equipment, vehicles and gates (US$12.0 million). In case of downstream
control automatic gates (US$0.70 million), because of a limited number of
reliable manufacturers throughout the world with patent authorization, these
may be procured using Limited International Bidding (LIB) procedures. Where
compatibility of spare parts or other items with installed equipment is
required or where items are only available from a sole source of supply,
contracts would be negotiated directly with the manufacturers or authorized
agents. Maximum aggregate value for direct contracting will not exceed U.S.
$1.0 million. International shopping, based on at least three quotations from
at least two countries, would be used for items of small value such as office
equipment, water management and communication equipment with an estimated
value of upto US$120,000 equivalent each. There would be an aggregate limit
on international shopping of US$1.0 million.



- 18 -
3.21        Small items costing less that US$60,000 and miscellaneous
equipment and materials for office, laboratories, field investigations and
office furniture which are available locally at competitive prices, may be
awarded on competitive basis to reliable suppliers after quotations have been
obtained from at least three such suppliers. The aggregate amount of such
locally procured good would not exceed US$1.0 million equivalent.
Civil Works
3.22        Contracting for the Bank Group financed parts of improvement of
main and secondary canals delivery system and tertiary system development
would follow ICB procedures in accordance with the Bank's Procurement
Guidelines. Bids would be invited from prequalified firms/contractors. In the
ongoing USAID assisted IIP project and the drainage projects financed by the
Bank Group, civil works contracts did not generally attract foreign or big
contractors, and only slices of packages were awarded to small contractors,
who, typically, have a weak financial base, inadequate technical staff and
limited support equipment. ICB contracts would represent 97 percent of the
total civil works.
3.23        Civil works for irrigation service centers, staff housing, field
office facilities and small building facilities are not suitable for ICB
because they are small, scattered throughout the subproject areas and would be
implemented in small contracts during the construction period. These works
amounting to US$2.30 million equivalent with a maximum value of each contract
of not more than US$250,000 would be procured following Local Competitive
Bidding (LCB) procedures. Standard LCB documents used in other Bank-assisted
projects will be used and agreed before issuance of the first LCB civil works
tender.
3.24        Bid documents and proposed awards for civil works having an
estimated contract value of more than US$1.0 million equivalent and for goods
having an estimated value of more than US$300,000 equivalent would be subject
to prior review by the Bank. Contracts for lesser amount would be subject to
post review. These limits would result in prior review of contracts
representing about 85 percent of procurement total to be financed by the Bank
group.
E. Disbursements
3.25        The proposed IDA credit of SDR35.7 million (equivalent US$53.3
million) and Bank loan of US$26.7 million would be disbursed in seven years
against the categories and at rates shown in Annex IV, Table 4.
3.26        All applications for disbursement would be made by IIPD.
Disbursement would be made against full documentation except for payments
against contracts for goods, works and services respectively, not exceeding
the equivalent of US$300,000, US$1,000,000 and US$50,000, which may be
disbursed against statement of expenditures (SOEs). It is estimated that
total disbursement under SOEs would be about US$3 million. Supporting
documents for SOE claims would be retained by IIPD and made available for
inspection by Bank supervision missions and project auditors.   IIPD would
aggregate withdrawal applications for disbursement, so that the total amount
would not be less than US$40,000 equivalent. A special account has rarely
been used in the past by MPWWR. However, provision is made under the project
for such an account in case IIPD decides to use it.   An authorized allocation
of an equivalent amount of US$3.0 million will be made and deposited into the
Special Account.
3.27        The estimated schedule of IBRD/IDA loan/credit disbursements in
given in Table 3.4 and in Annex IV, Table 3. The disbursement profile is
projected over a seven year period from January 1996 to December 2002.  The



- 19 -
profile follows fairly closely the disbursement for agriculture projects in
Egypt.

F.  Accounts and Audits
3.28        IIPD, like all Government agencies, is subject to GOE expenditure
control and auditing procedures. The Financial and Administrative Unit of
IIPD would be responsible for establishing and maintaining separate accounts
for the project, reflecting, in accordance with appropriate accounting
practices, the operations and expenditures of the project. The Central Audit
Organization (CAO), an independent auditing agency currently responsible for
auditing the accounts of all of MPWWR agencies, would audit the project
accounts. CAO performs continuous audits, generally preparing three interim
reports each year and consolidating its findings in an annual report. In
order to strengthen the accounting function, provision has been made under the
project for the training of accounting personnel and for the streamlining of
the accounting system within IIPD, using the MIS introduced under the ongoing
USAID assisted project. These improvements would help ensure the timely
preparation of accounts.
3.29        Assurances were obtained at negotiations (a) that all project
related contracts and documents for disbursement made against SOE would be
kept for at least one year after the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal
from the credit/loan accounts were made; (b) that the accounts would be
audited by CAO or an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank Group; (c)
that the audit would include the examination of all SOEs and audits of special
account submitted to the Bank for reimbursement; and (d) that audited
accounts, together with the auditor's reports, would be furnished to the Bank
Group within nine months of the end of each fiscal year.
G. Environmental Impact
3.30        The project has been assigned Environmental Category B consistent
with O.D. 4.01 "Environmental Assessment," and has been subject to field-based
environmental review. An Environmental Management plan would be implemented
to support: (a) institutional strengthening and training of MPWWR and other
implementing agencies staff; (b) a water quality management and monitoring
program by DRI; and (c) an agricultural chemical management program. The
field-based environmental review that was performed, indicates that the
project would have a generally positive impact on the environment by improving
water use efficiency and protecting soil resources from waterlogging and
salinization in the irrigated areas. Current use of drainage effluent with
high salinity contents during peak demand months will be controlled by mixing
drainage effluent with fresh water at reuse pumping stations thus improving
the quality of water. Potential environmental management problems associated
with the degradation of water quality and the use of fertilizers and
pesticides would be addressed.
3.31        The project is designed to strengthen overall environmental
management. Special training would be given to the MPWWR technical staff
concerning the use of environmental assessments in the project planning and
implementation process. The project would promote the incorporation of
environmental concerns into the planning, design, implementation and
monitoring of irrigation and drainage projects.



- 20 -
3.32        Despite the overall positive impact of the project, there are
environmental issues which are external to the project, which include: (a) the
presence of bilharzia and measures taken by the Government to control
schistosomiasis; and (b) the mixing of drainage water with clean canal water
for reuse. Planned project activities would not escalate any of the problems
but would in fact help ameliorate them. The following describes the current
situation and initiatives proposed to address these issues.
(a)   Bilharzia.  The bilharzia disease continues to be prevalent in the
Delta with a prevalence rate of about 30 percent in the Baheira
Governorate. The control measures used by the Ministry of Health
(MOH) are chemotherapy (oral use of drugs), focussed application
of molluscicides and public health education. The use of
chemotherapy has provided the most effective control in many
parts of the world.   MOH is using this approach successfully
(over 95 percent effective) and has funding from many sources. No
additional funding is provided under the project. Because of
serious environmental consequences from the use of molluscicides,
MOH has significantly reduced their aggregate application, from
over 300 tons in the mid-1980s to about 30 tons in 1993. Future
application is triggered only when local infection rate exceeds 30
percent. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that: (a) MPWWR
would take measures to prevent snails from reinfecting the drains,
to reduce the frequency and need for molluscicides; and (b) WRC,
in coordination with MOH, would prepare a short report on the
prevalence of the disease and the use of molluscicides for the two
Governorates (Baheira and Kafr El-Sheikh), for the Bank's review
each year.
(b)   Reuse of Drainage Water. Currently 4 billion cubic meter (BCM) of
drainage water is mixed with fresh water in canals and MPWWR plans
to build additional pumping stations to mix 7 BCM of drainage
water by the year 2000. The addition of drainage water to fresh
water increases the volume of water available for reuse but
reduces the water quality.   Most project areas, however, are
located downstream of existing or planned pumping stations for
water reuse. Therefore, the project would not impact
significantly on agricultural water reuse. DRI monitors the
salinity and Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR) through an extensive
network of measuring stations in canals and drains. Recently DRI
has started to monitor other water quality parameters indicative
of sewage and/or industrial waste.
3.33        Industrial and Domestic Water Pollution.  Drainage channels north
of Kafr El-Dowar in the Mahmoudia subproject are recipients of industrial and
domestic wastewater. The industrial waste is from textile factories, and it
is important that the discharge of untreated industrial and domestic effluent
is controlled to improve drainage water quality and avoid public health
hazards. These areas are not a part of the project, but because of the
seriousness of the environmental issues associated with the future development
of the downstream part of Mahmoudia Canal, it is essential that steps be taken
to monitor environmental parameters. MPWR agreed to prepare an Environmental
Assessment (EA) leading to an action plan for treatment of such industrial
waste before it is discharged into the Mahmoudia Canal, supported by the
project through technical assistance. EA will be based on the monitoring of
various industrial waste elements for a period of two years and findings which
could be presented in a report.

IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Institutional Arrangements
The Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources (MPWWR)
4.1         MPWWR is responsible for the development of water resources and
the construction and maintenance of the irrigation and drainage systems. The
Irrigation Department of MPWWR is responsible for the O&M of all public
canals. The semi-autonomous Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects
(EPADP) is responsible for implementing the drainage projects and maintaining
both surface and subsurface drainage systems. Both of these organizations are
structured along regional lines with a general directorate in each
Governorate. The Water Research Center (WRC) conducts research on water
related issues including the reuse of drainage flows through eleven of its
research institutes, two of which are of particular concern to the project
i.e. DRI and IRI. The Mechanical and Electrical Department (MED) is
responsible for installing, operating and maintaining all irrigation and
drainage pumping stations including reuse stations. An outline of the
organization of MPWWR is given in Chart No. 1.
Irrigation Improvement Proiect Directorate (IIPD)
4.2         The Irrigation Department of MPWWR is responsible for five
sectors; Irrigation Sector, Horizontal Expansion and Project Sector, Nile
Water Sector, Dams and Big Barrages Sector and Administration and Finance
Sector. IIPD is under the Horizontal Expansion and Project Sector and is
headed by an Undersecretary.
4.3         IIPD is currently handling the IIP Pilot Project financed by USAID
in six governorates. At its headquarters in Cairo it is composed of four
sections; design, Irrigation Advisory Service, Planning and Finance, and
Construction. Field offices are located in six governorates and each field
office is headed by a General Director with six units; surveys and design of
delivery system improvement, design of tertiary (meska development),
construction, IAS, feasibility studies and planning, and
finance/administration. Headquarters staff in Cairo consists of about 20
engineers, two economists, two agriculturists, three accounting staff, twenty
technicians (surveyors and draftsmen) and ten clerical staff. Field staff
varies according to the workload and generally is composed of about 20
engineers, four agriculturists, 10 to 15 field agents in the IAS, about 15
construction supervisors, and about 10 surveyors/drafts person.
4.4         IIPD organization will be slightly modified to accommodate the
workload of the project. No change is foreseen at the headquarters except a
new section will be created for the project headed by a Project Director who
will report to the Undersecretary for IIPD. The Project Director will work
closely with two sections of IIPD i.e. design and IAS. More staff will be
added to these two sections to undertake the project work. Design section at
the headquarters will be responsible for producing typical design and also for
reviewing the design prepared in the field offices. IAS will be responsible
for the organization and communication activities. Because of added
responsibility of communication and establishment of command area WUAs, IAS
would require additional staff of different specialties. A new unit on
training and monitoring and evaluation will be established which will report
directly to the undersecretary in charge of IIPD. The new unit will be
responsible for all training aspects of IIP, defining the needs of training,
identifying locations and various courses for both in-house and overseas
training as well as workshops and seminars. The ned unit will also be
responsible for M&E activities and various socio-economic surveys connected
with M&E and also for the compilation of periodic progress reports. This unit



- 22 -
will be headed by a senior economist and will have staff composed of two
training specialists, one engineer, two economists and about three
technicians. Terms of reference for the unit were agreed at pre-appraisal.
4.5         The Project Director will carry out day-to-day activities with the
assistance of two units - Construction and Procurement Unit and a Finance
Unit. The Construction and Procurement Unit will be responsible for compiling
tender documents based on tender drawings received from the field and standard
bidding documents developed for the project. The unit will be responsible for
tender processing of each contract from advertisement to bid opening,
evaluation and award of contracts. The Construction Unit will also compile
construction progress reports and participate in field inspection of works and
handover of the meska to the WUGs after one year of completion of meska
development. The Finance Unit will be responsible for payments to various
suppliers and contractors, disbursement applications to be sent to the Bank
Group, upkeep of separate project accounts and audits, etc. The unit will be
headed by an experienced accountant with a staff of about 3 to 4 accountants.
4.6         Current field offices at Dammanhour and Kafr El-Sheikh will be
responsible for the project activities. USAID-financed works in these
Governorates have been completed and the staff is available to undertake
project works. In order to integrate the field O&M staff of the Irrigation
Department, some of the additional staff will be transferred from various
districts and the remaining will either be seconded from the MALR or
recruited. The available staff and newly recruited staff will undergo a short
training conducted by the communications and IAS staff. Following will be the
scale of requirements for each field office particularly for IAS and
construction activities:
(a)   IAS - Field Agent for about 700 fed area; two organization
experts/ sociologist, two irrigation engineers/water management
specialists and one mechanical technician for each command area
center of about 8,000 fed; one engineer, a communication engineer,
one agriculturists/sociologists and a mechanical engineer at the
Governorate level in the field office;
(b)   Construction - One engineer and two to three supervisors for each
contract; two senior engineers, one mechanical engineer, three to
four technicians (surveyors/drafts person) and two more
technicians for preparation of contractors bills and progress
reports in the Governorate level at the field office.
4.7         MPWWR has appointed key staff to the following eight positions
through a Ministerial decree dated August 22, 1994, which was a condition of
negotiations:
(a)   At headquarters in Cairo - Project Director and Director in-charge
of Irrigation Advisory Service; and
(b)   At each Field Office in Dammanhour and Kafr El-Sheikh - field
office Director, Chief of IAS Unit, Chief of Engineering Unit
responsible for design and construction.
An outline of the proposed IIP and project organization both in Cairo and
field offices is given in Chart No. 2. A list of incremental staff to be
recruited with a schedule of recruitment is given in Annex II, Tables 1, 3, 5,
6, 7 and 8.
Other Institutions Involved in the Implementation
4.8         Although the project would be implemented primarily by IIPD, there
are other agencies besides IIPD whose input is essential for the timely



- 23 -
execution of various components. The technical office of the Minister of
MPWWR is expected to be responsible for the communication component. The on-
farm irrigation management pilot program will be carried out jointly by MPWWR
and the specialized agencies of MALR with active participation from the IRI in
the WRC of MPWWR and SWRI and Extension Department (ED) of MALR. IIPD will
be responsible for administrative aspects of procurement and disbursement and
SWRI of MALR will be responsible for technical aspects. Water quality
monitoring will be undertaken by the DRI. The WRC is expected to play a major
role in the environmental activities. To facilitate implementation, MPWWR has
established: (a) a Technical Coordinating Committee, chaired by the Chairman
of the Irrigation Department with membership from representatives of WRC, DRI
and SWRI of MALR. A representative from EEAA will be invited, whenever there
is a discussions concerning environmental issues. The Committee would meet
quarterly or more frequently as needed to facilitate coordination and address
issues of the annual program and implementation schedule; and (b) a local
coordinating committee at the Governorate level for each of the two
subprojects, chaired by the Undersecretary Irrigation and will be composed of
field director of IIP, Undersecretary for Agriculture of MALR and IAS field
director. These committees have been established through a Ministerial Decree
dated August 15, 1994; that issuance of this decree was a Condition of Board
Presentation.
Implementation Improvements
4.9         The USAID-assisted IIP pilot project had faced some difficulties
in the implementation and adoption of continuous flow concept. In order to
address these weaknesses in implementation (see paras. 1.15 and 1.16), the
following actions were agreed:
(a)   Organize WUGs for the works to be implemented during initial two
years under PHRD grant, and prepare bidding documents for tender
processing before project effectiveness which will facilitate a
rapid start-up of implementation;
(b)   Technical assistance would be financed through the bi-lateral
assistance of KfW, and NDGIC which would enable the project to
proceed smoothly with timely expert input for various components
of the project;
(c)   Cost sharing arrangements are in place under the recently amended
Irrigation Law; in addition the establishment of command area
Water Users' Associations would help in promoting future
sustainability;
(d)   Staff requirement will be met through transfer of design
activities to the field offices, transfer of district irrigation
staff and recruitment of new staff. Key staff has been appointed;
(e)   On-farm irrigation management demonstration program would ensure
tripartite coordination between farmers, IAS and agriculture
extension; and
(f)   prequalification of local and foreign contractors under ICB
contracts for civil works and limiting such contracts to a minimum
contract value of LE 3.0 million would ensure participation by
experienced and qualified contractors.
B. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
4.10        Evaluation and impact studies are needed to gauge the
effectiveness of the project in achieving its stated objectives i.e. to
increase agricultural production, improve the income of farmers, promote water



- 24 -
conservation through more efficient use, reduction of soil salinity in areas
receiving mixed drainage effluent, contribute towards energy saving and
sustainability through takeover of the tertiary system for O&M by the
beneficiaries, cost sharing arrangements for the investment cost and
functioning of the WUGs and WUAs. A standardized system covering a set of
predetermined indicators would facilitate the Monitoring and Evaluation of the
project.
4.11        As explained earlier, the M&E unit has been established under the
project. The unit will be assisted initially by international consultants who
will design the system, develop measurable indicators, conduct baseline
surveys and outline procedure for monitoring and evaluation. Periodic
analysis of indicators would enable the MPWWR Managers and financing agencies
to intervene and recommend/implement desirable changes to achieve the project
objectives. A provision has been made for 22 staff-months of international
consultants and 60 staff-months of Egyptian experts in various fields
initially to develop the program and for short annual visits to assist in the
analysis.
4.12        The M&E Unit will require the assistance of a few agencies outside
IIP who will be contracted to provide the required information. Agencies
within MPWWR will be given logistical support for periodic surveys and
collection of data. The major elements for monitoring and agencies which will
assist in surveys and collection of data are given in Annex V, Table 2. The
Implementation Schedule is detailed in Annex IV, Table 5.
C. Supervision Plan
Borrower Contribution
4.13        Six monthly progress reports would be submitted at the end of
March and September of each year. These reports would focus on: (a) the
status of award of contracts and physical progress of civil works, areas for
which design work was completed during the reporting period; and equipment
procurement under various contracts during the period and accumulative for
each contract; (b) the status of technical assistance and various studies; (c)
brief summary of information on various key indicators from the M&E; (d) the
annual work program and budgetary requirement for counterpart funds and O&M
funds (March report only); (e) brief summary of IAS activities focusing on
organization of new WUGs, specific assistance provided to WUGs and WUAs; (f)
the status of IDA/Bank disbursements including pending withdrawal applications
and projected disbursement for the following six months; (g) the status of
disbursements by other cofinanciers; (h) a summary of the issues raised by the
previous supervision mission and their resolution; and (i) the status of
miscellaneous issues, such a legal covenants, accounts and audits and project
staffing as well as staff training.
Bank Group SuPervision Missions
4.14        The Project Director would be responsible for coordinating
arrangements for review missions by the Bank Group and other cofinanciers and
for information required by the missions. Review meetings, would normally be
held in May and November of each year. Missions would normally be accompanied
in the field by the Project Director and IAS Director. The Bank group would
make efforts to supervise the project jointly with other cofinanciers at least
once a year.
4.15        A tentative supervision plan is shown in Annex V, Table 1; it
provides for 16 supervision missions over the life of the project including a
project launch, an interim in-depth review two years after project
effectiveness and mid-term review requiring 149 staffweeks. Because of the
nature of project with institutional/organizational issues professional inputs
of engineering and agriculture will be required in all of the missions during



- 25 -
the initial three years and at least once a year in later years. To review
functioning of WUAs and WUGs a sociologist or a specialist in this field
would also be included in the supervision mission. A minimum supervision time
of 17 staffweeks per year would be required.
Interim in-depth review, Mid-term Review and Completion Report
4.16        An interim in-depth review of all project activities will be
carried out two years after project effectiveness. The purpose of this review
is to ensure that WUG's and WUA's are in place and have effectively taken over
the responsibility of operation and maintenance of tertiary blocks, continuous
flow operation with downstream controls is effective and technical assistance
by other co-financiers is effectively in place. Such review will enable the
Bank group, other cofinanciers and the Government to agree on any changes, if
required, in the project implementation procedures. A mid-term review of all
project activities would be conducted jointly by all project implementing
agencies i.e. IIP, WRC, DRI, IRI of MPWWR; SWRI and ED of MALR; the Bank Group
and all cofinanciers. To facilitate the review, IIPD with the assistance of
other implementing agencies would prepare a detailed report for submission to
the Bank Group and all cofinanciers by December 31, 1998 for a joint review by
March 1999. Section II of the Implementation completion report would be
prepared by IIPD and submitted to the Bank Group not later than six months
after the credit/loan closing date. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that IIPD would submit: (a) a detailed progress report for the mid-term review
by December 31, 1998; and (b) Section II of the Implementation Completion
Report not later than six months after the loan closing date.
V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
A. CroRPing Patterns
General
5.1         The new operation system of continuous flow would allow on demand
availability of irrigation water to farmers. This in turn would:
(i) establish a more equitable water distribution system, (ii) progressively
eliminate over-irrigation by upstream farmers and, (iii) halt the decline of
agricultural productivity as well as improve yields (particularly for summer
crops) in the salt affected and thirsty downstream areas, which are estimated
to represent about 60 to 70 percent of the total project area. The improved
Meskas and the use of single lift pumps would bring about a significant
reduction in pumping costs and would allow better irrigation timing. Project
activities aimed at demonstrating better cultural practices and improved on-
farm irrigation management techniques would also help in increasing crop
yields and agricultural productivity. It should be pointed out that rice crop
is planted in the northern part of delta as a reclamation crop primarily for
leaching. The following is an analysis of the agricultural development that
is anticipated under the project.
Expected Changes in CroRping Patterns
5.2         Mahmoudia.  Present cropping patterns indicate that out of a total
net irrigated area of 131,000 feddan, 113,900 fed. are cultivated to annuals,
the rest (13.3 percent), because of the proximity of the Alexandria market and
port, are devoted to citrus plantations. With the exception of minor salt-
affected tail-end areas ( whose size is nonetheless increasing) that do not
receive sufficient irrigation water, all the land cultivated to annuals is
planted once in the winter and once in the summer; this gives a global
cropping intensity of about 200 percent ( Annex 1, Table 2, page 1). In terms
of area, beseem Trifolium alexandrinum covers 53 percent of the area cropped
in the winter (59,400 fed.) and is the most important crop of the season.



- 26 -
This fodder crop is often cut to be sold or to be used by farmers to feed
their family livestock. Wheat is the next most important winter crop (38
percent of the area) followed by winter vegetables (6 percent) and broad beans
(3 percent). In the summer and because of the lack of sufficient irrigation
water, the area devoted to rice and needs to be leached from salts
(reclamation) is restricted to an area of 39,300 fed. (34 percent); the rest
is occupied by cotton (34 percent) maize (21 percent) sunflower and vegetables
(11 percent).
5.3         As a result of the project, it is anticipated that the increased
water availability to tail-end farmers will allow them to cultivate rice as a
reclamation crop more frequently and thereby leach their lands from salts at
least once every two years. Hence, the area devoted to rice is expected to
increase by about 23 percent and cover 57 percent of the total summer cropped
area. As a consequence the areas devoted to cotton and maize will decrease
significantly. Lands whose salt has been leached (reclaimed through the rice
crop) would in the future support more high value winter crops for which
marketing is not a problem. It is therefore anticipated that the area
cultivated to broad beans, vegetables and wheat would increase by a total of
10 percent. Because concrete or PVC Meskas do not take up as much space as
traditional Meskas, about 750 fed. would be saved throughout the sub-project
area and would be put under production.
5.4         Manaifa.    Existing cropping patterns indicate that winter crops
are dominated by beseem, which covers 23,150 fed. or 55 percent of the area
cropped in the winter season. Because of its soil enriching capabilities,
beseem is an ideal cultural precedent for almost all summer crops. Its growth
cycle can be cut short (hence the name short beseem) to accommodate the 7
months growth-cycle of cotton or left to grow longer and precede rice or
summer vegetables. The next most important crop is wheat (37 percent of the
area) followed by sugar beets (3 percent), flax (3 percent), broad beans and
vegetables (2 percent). The existing rice area, representing 53 percent of
the total area planted to summer crops, indicates that rice is by far the most
important crop in area terms and that Manaifa has proportionally more water
available than at Mahmoudia. However, much of the rice fields in this sub-
project area are irrigated with low quality drainage water. Drainage water
becomes available and abundant a few weeks after upstream farmers start
establishing their rice paddies. Because they cannot get access to fresh
water early in the season and have to wait for drainage water to become
available, downstream farmers transplant their rice from 2 to 4 weeks after
the optimum transplanting time and therefore suffer from reduced yields.
Cotton is the next most important summer crop with 28 percent of the area
followed by maize and summer vegetables covering each 15 and 4 percent of the
area respectively.
5.5         With the project, cropping patterns are not expected to change
dramatically. However, when irrigation water becomes available on-demand,
timely crop establishment and irrigations as well as better quality irrigation
water would allow for planting more high value crops and increase yields of
both winter and summer crops. Results of farmer surveys, conducted by the
existing IIP staff, indicate that future cropping patterns would see slight
adjustments in the wheat area, which would decrease by 3 percent in favor of
the higher value broad beans and sugar beets (Annex 1. Table 2, page 2). The
area devoted to cotton would also decrease by a small 2 percent in favor of
rice (because of leaching requirement) and summer vegetables, which are
expected to nudge ahead by 1 percent each. As is the case in Mahmoudia about
220 fed would be saved in the process of improving Meskas and would be put
under agricultural production as a result of the project.
5.6         El Wasat. Present cropping patterns at El Wasat are as
diversified as in Manaifa but more so than in Mahmoudia (Annex 1. Table 2,
page 3). In addition to the traditional beseem (53 percent of the area) and



- 27 -
wheat (30 percent) winter season crops, farmers in this area cultivate sugar
beets (8 percent), flax (5 percent), broad beans (2 percent) and winter
vegetables (2 percent). Flax Linum usitatissum is one of the oldest winter
season crops in Egypt; it is cultivated for its fiber (to make fine linen) and
for its 32 to 44 percent linseed-oil content. In the summer, the major crop
is rice which occupies 44 percent of the area, it is followed by maize (27
percent) and cotton (25 percent). As a result of the project, 250 fed. would
be gained on the area previously occupied by traditional Meskas and put under
production.
5.7         In the future, with more equitable and regular water distribution,
it is anticipated that the area devoted to beseem would decrease by 5 percent
in favor of higher value crops, such as vegetables, wheat and broad beans. In
the summer, the increased water availability would allow farmers to expand the
area of rice to 51 percent of the area cultivable in the summer and the area
of vegetables to 6 percent. This adjustment would be achieved at the expense
of maize and cotton which will see their areas reduced accordingly. As
explained above, increasing the area planted to rice would allow farmeis to
leach salts from their soils, while improving their yields of rice and other
succeeding crops.
B. Anticipated Crop Yields
5.8         As a result of the anticipated reliable availability of good
quality water, as well as the expected improvements in on-farm irrigation
management, crop yields would increase by 8 to 15 percent for winter crops and
by 28 to 41 percent for summer crops. These increments are equivalent to
present average differences in yields between upstream farmers receiving
adequate and timely irrigation water and tail-end farmers suffering from the
lack of or untimeliness in obtaining their water. Yields for all crops are
detailed in Annex 1, Table 1 and summarized below. For summer crops, yield
increases are significant because of present inadequate and untimely supply of
water. In the Manaifa sub-project, yield levels are slightly lower than for
the two other sub-project areas because of farmers' use of less efficient
cultural practices and considerable water stress at the lower end of the
system.   At El Wasat,  yields are highest of the three sub-projects for rice
and vegetables.

VI. MARKETING. PRICES AND INCOME
A. Marketing. Prices and Income
Marketing and Prices
6.1         The project's major incremental production at full development
(Year 11) would include 109,000 tons of rice, 129,000 tons of winter and
summer vegetables, 38,000 tons of citrus, 26,000 tons of wheat, 20,000 tons of



- 28 -
sugar beets, and 4,000 tons of broad beans. Currently, Egypt is a net
importer of wheat, maize, sugar, cooking oils, milk, butter and meat. With
population growth at 2.2 percent per annum and a projected average annual
growth of real per capita income of around 2 percent per year for the
remainder of the 1990s, growth in per capita food consumption is expected to
average in excess of 1.2 percent2. It is expected that most of the food grain
and vegetable production of the project would be absorbed domestically. The
additional production of sugar beets would also be absorbed without any
difficulty, especially since Government's objective is to promote beet sugar
production in preference to cane sugar and to conserve water consumption. As
in the past, the additional citrus (mainly orange) production would be
exported. A small amount of rice, onions, tomatoes would also be exported to
Europe and other Middle East countries.
6.2         In the absence of accurate farmgate prices, actual 1992/93 prices
with some adjustment for market fluctuations was used for all commodities in
the farm budget analyses. Prices for fertilizers are based on prevailing
market prices; the fertilizer subsidy was recently eliminated. The detailed
assumptions on prices received by farmers under the project are shown in Annex
VI, Table 1.
Farm Income
6.3         Farm income was analyzed for three representative farm sizes
(small, medium, and large) in each of the sub-project areas. Due to
differences in water accessibility, there is currently an average difference
in yields between the upstream farmers and the tail-end farmers of about B to
15 percent (depending on the specific crop) for winter crops and about 29 to
41 percent for summer crops. With the proposed project, these differences are
expected to disappear. It is also important to note that present yield levels
are not expected to continue without the project. The continuous use of
saline drainage effluent without mixing with fresh water will cause a severe
build-up of salt content in the soil, crop yields are expected to deteriorate
significantly over time. The analysis conservatively assumed that, without
the project yields would fall 20 percent over the next ten years. Only farm
incomes (with and without the project) were calculated; off-farm incomes are
significant, in particular for those farmers with only a small plot of land.
6.4         A summary of the income estimates is given in Table 6.1 below,
with the details shown in Annex VI, Table 2. Incremental income would vary by
sub-project. Although overall incomes are expected to remain unchanged, the
project is expected to have a positive impact on reducing the level of
absolute poverty. Average per capita income would increase from L.E. 109 to
L.E. 199 for small farms constituting about 83 percent increase. Most
importantly, an efficient use of water at the farm level would result in an
overall saving of water.

B. Cost Sharing Arrangements
6.5        Amendment of Irrigation Law No. 12 of 1984.  The new legislation
authorizes MPWWR to: (a) maintain meskas and tertiary drains at farmer expense
in the event they fail to do so on their own; (b) organize farmer groups to
maintain and operate meska facilities; (c) recover the full capital costs of
meska improvements without interest; and (d) establish a Special Fund within
the Ministry of Finance to finance future meska improvement. Besides
recoveries from farmers, the Fund would be financed from budgetary transfers
and foreign grants and loans. A committee has been established to draft the
executive regulations for the implementation of the new legislation. It is
expected that the executive regulations will be issued before end of June
1995.
6.6        Issues agreed during appraisal were: (i) repayment of the cost of
the pump over a period not exceeding 5 years; (ii) repayment of the civil
works over a period of ten to twenty years based on farmers' capacity to pay;
(iii) initiation of repayment by farmers not later than the end of the first
year following completion of meska improvement; and (iv) strengthening of the
proposed Irrigation Advisory Service to support Water User Groups in financial
and related matters. While the WUGs would determine the mode of recovery of
O&M costs from their members, they would be encouraged to base recovery on a
proxy for the volume of water (e.g. according to the time of pumping) rather
than on a per feddan basis since this would provide incentives for improved
water use efficiency. Creation of a strong financial management and accounting
system by the WUGs would be a priority objective of the IAS.   Some WUGs are
already keeping reasonably good accounts and charge their members on a time
basis with payment made to the pump operator prior to agreed time of delivery
of water.

6.7         Main System Studies. The USAID-supported studies are being
implemented in three phases. The first phase, completed in January 1993,
estimated the operation, maintenance and rehabilitation (OM&R) expenditures
required to raise the performance of the Nile water delivery system to an
adequate level, and established a base for allocating these costs between
different users. The second phase, completed in October 1993, evaluated
farmer ability to pay the costs allocated to the irrigation sector. The third
phase will start in January/February 1995 and be completed by December 1995.
It will propose an implementation program inter alia covering: the roles of
the respective government entities and users; the phasing of the program over
a five year period; administrative mechanisms and procedures; any future
studies/analysis required to refine the program and/or the proposed levels of
cost recovery; and a financial plan for the OM&R of the irrigation system
considering existing and future conditions, sources of funds, and government
and private responsibilities for the management of such funds.
6.8         The nationwide average annual main system OM&R cost attributable
to irrigation was estimated by the first phase study at between LE 75-109 per
feddan at December 1991 prices, equivalent to LE 11-16 per thousand cubic
meters (US$3.3-4.8 per thousand cubic meters). This level is modest by
international standards, and in principle is within the capacity of farmers to
pay. To this in theory should be added the shadow price (opportunity cost) of
water to obtain its full marginal cost. As water shortages increase, this
will tend to rise. Thus, depending on the extent of water shortages, the
opportunity cost can be expected to be high in relation to the costs of OM&R.
6.9         Few  countries--if any--allow for opportunity cost in their
charges to farmers. Such a policy is particularly controversial in Islamic
countries, since, though payment for the mobilization of water and its
distribution is often accepted, the idea that there should in addition be a
resource charge may be unacceptable. Moreover, in the case of Egypt, first
priority must be given to consolidating farmer responsibility for meska level
costs and to establishing a consensus that farmers should contribute to the
cost of the main system. This in itself is an ambitious objective and merits
careful study. In respect to meska level costs, as described above, the
project will strengthen implementation of the recent legislation. In respect
to main system costs, the third phase report of the USAID-supported program
will be reviewed with GOE as a basis for proposing the phased introduction of
a system of better demand management. Concurrently, the project will support
an ambitious public awareness program to increase public understanding of the
nature of the water shortages facing Egypt over the long term, and to help
promote a consensus that users should be required to meet the cost of water
delivery.
6.10        Cost Recovery of Irrigation Improvement Costs.  Meska irrigation
improvement costs consist of two components: investment costs for the pump and
civil works, and operation and maintenance costs of pumps, canals/PVC pipes,
etc. These costs would be fully repaid by beneficiaries; in the case of O&M
costs, farmers would pay these costs directly to the WUGs, while the
investment costs would be paid to Government, without interest, in accordance
with the principles outlined above (para 6.6).
6.11        Farmers' Ability to Pay.  Annex VI, Table 3 shows the payments
that should be made by beneficiaries in order to recover meska pump and civil
works investment costs, as well as the costs of operations and maintenance
(O&M) of canals, covered PVC pipes, and pumps. Estimates of O&M costs
represent average annual costs per feddan; actual costs would vary depending
on actual pumping time. Recovery of investment costs per feddan, over 15
years without interest, falls in the LE 156-160 range (over 85 percent for
civil works). After taking into consideration the saving in pumping costs
(about LE 58/fed), total annual payments for investment and O&M costs would be
LE 136-141 per feddan.



- 31 -
6.12        Payments for meska investment and O&M costs, expressed as a
proportion of incremental income attributed to irrigation improvements, varies
between 15-25 percent. This shows the ability of beneficiaries to pay; it
also shows that there is a strong incentive for farmers to participate in the
irrigation improvement project.
6.13        Assurances were obtained during negotiations that: (a) the cost
sharing arrangements for the recovery of investment cost of meska improvement
will be based on the recovery of cost of pumps not exceeding five years and
other civil works over a period of ten to twenty years based on farmers'
capacity to pay from the time of completion of these improvements; and (b) in
order to achieve the desired impact of water use efficiency, IAS through an
awareness campaign would train WUGs to collect O&M cost on a hourly basis of
use.
6.14        The project area is located in the northern parts of the Delta,
where on account of extensive drainage reuse, water quality is extremely poor
and limits crop choices by farmers. For such poor quality of water, it is
difficult to provide a ratio of cost recovery as a share of Long Range
marginal Costs (LRMC). Cost recovery measures being adopted under the
project, while indicating progress, would mean that the economic distortia
will continue as far as the price mechanism for water resources demand
management is concerned, since the extent of cost recovery being carried out
was likely to be a relatively small percent of the LRMC.
VII. BENEFITS. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND RISKS
Benefits
7.1         Overall in the three sub-project areas, about 95,000 farm
households (or about 654,000 people) would directly benefit from the project:
about 34,000 in Mahmoudia, 26,000 in Manaifa, and 35,000 in El Wasat. The
project would primarily benefit farm households, increasing their incomes by
providing timely and adequate amount of irrigation water, and preventing a
loss in their income levels from what would otherwise be a deterioration of
soil conditions. Through the organization of WUGs, the project would also
result in a 34 percent saving in the pumping cost of irrigation water.
Calculations of such savings are given in Annex VII, Table 1. In addition, it
would promote community-based participation and encourage private sector
participation. Also importantly, the project will assist farmers, through
improved on-farm management and better communication, in efficient use of
water resources. It is also likely that the health of farmers would be
improved due to a reduction of exposure to bilharzia.
Economic Analysis
7.2         The benefits from the prevention of deterioration of soil
conditions are difficult to quantify. A conservative approach, assuming
yields would fall 20 percent over the next ten years, was adopted in
calculating the direct project benefits. Because of the current variation in
the water distribution at the tertiary level, it was also assumed that only 60
percent of the project area would benefit from the project. Although there
would also be water saving as a result of the proposed project because of
improved overall irrigation efficiency, however, the benefit of such saving
was not included in the calculations of economic rate of return. Farmgate
prices for traded goods are projected based on the December, 1994, IBRD
commodity price forecasts (Annex VII, Table 2). Non-traded goods prices are
based on domestic financial prices and are assumed not to change in real
terms. Various Standard Conversion Factors (SCF) were used to convert
domestic financial prices into border prices. Project life was assumed to be
30 years, with full development reached in project year 11. A time lag of two
years was assumed between the time of investment in civil work and the



- 32 -
beginning of partial benefits received by the farmer. Flows of economic
benefits and costs are given in Annex VII, Table 4.
7.3         The Economic Rates of Return (ERR) are estimated at 26 percent for
Mahmoudia, 25 percent for Manaifa, and 24 percent for El-Wasat, resulting to
an overall project ERR of 25 percent. At a discount rate of 12 percent, the
assumed opportunity cost of capital in Egypt, the overall project's discounted
benefit in present value would be US$218.3 million and the discounted costs
US$92.0 million, leading to an economic net present value of US$126.2 million.
Net present values for each sub-project are shown in Table 7.1. Economic
benefits and costs are expressed in constant FY94 prices.

Sensitivity Analysis
7.4         Sensitivity tests indicate that all three sub-projects remain
viable under a variety of assumptions regarding costs and benefits. As shown
in Annex VII, Table 3, with costs up 20 percent and a lag of incremental
benefits of up to three years, the ERRs would remain above 12 percent for all
sub-projects. For the project to become uneconomical, i.e., generate a real
rate of return below the assumed opportunity cost of capital (12 percent),
switching value analysis indicates benefits would have to fall 60 percent for
Mahmoudia, 57 percent for Manaifa, and 55 percent for El Wasat; or costs would
have to increase 148 percent for Mahmoudia, 135 percent for Manaifa, or 122
percent for El Wasat. Changes of such a magnitude in the cost or benefit
streams are unlikely, especially for Mahmoudia. Sensitivity tests were also
performed to test the project viability in response to international commodity
price changes. Sensitivity to the prices of the two main export items, rice
and cotton, were tested using the lower bound prices of the 70 percent
probability distribution.3 All three sub-projects remained economically
viable even if the prices of both of these commodities were below their lower
limits (only a 15 percent probability for each taken separately, but a 2.25
percent probability for the two to happen simultaneously if they are
statistically independent events).

Proiect Risks
7.5         The major risks are: (i) the limited implementation capacity of
domestic contractors which would reduce the area improved or may result in
delay; and (ii) delay in design of improvement works and procurement
processing. These risks would be minimized by: (i) prequalification of
contractors and the provisions of technical assistance and training of
contractors and IIPD staff; and (ii) advance actions on procurement and design
work using PHRD grants funds.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.1         The following assurances were obtained from the Government at
negotiations:
(a)   All project related contracts and documents for disbursement made
against SOE would be kept for at least one year after the fiscal
year in which the last withdrawal from the credit/loan accounts
were made; the accounts would be audited by CAO or an independent
auditor acceptable to the Bank Group; the audit would include the
examination of all SOEs and audits of special account submitted to
the Bank for reimbursement; and the audited accounts, together
with the auditor's reports, would be furnished to the Bank Group
within nine months of the end of each fiscal year (para. 3.29);
(b)   MPWWR would take measures to prevent snails from reinfecting the
drains; to reduce the frequency and need for mulluscicides, WRC in
coordination with MOH would prepare a short report on the
prevalence of bilharzia disease and the use of mulluscicides for
the two Governorates (Baheira and Kaft El-Sheikh) for the Bank
Groups' review each year (para. 3.32(a));
(c)   IIPD would submit a detailed progress report for the mid-term
review by December 31, 1998 and Section II of the Implementation
Completion Report not later than six months after the loan closing
date (para. 4.16); and
(d)   Under the cost sharing arrangements for recovery of investment
cost of Meksa improvement will be based on the recovery of cost of
pumps within five years and other civil works over a period of ten
to twenty years based on farmers capacity to pay from the time of
completion of these improvements; and in order to achieve the
desired impact of water use efficiency, IAS through an awareness
campaign would train WUGs to collect O&M cost on an hourly basis
of use (para. 6.13).



- 34 -
8.2         MPWWR has appointed experienced staff through a ministerial decree
to the positions of a Project Director and Section Chief in-charge of
Irrigation Advisory Service at the headquarters in Cairo and a Field Office
Director, Chief of IAS unit and Engineering Unit in each field office in
Dammanhour and Kafir El-Sheikh. Issuance of the Ministerial Decree was
Condition of NeQotiations (para. 4.7).
8.3         MPWWR has established a Technical Coordinating Committee, chaired
by the Chairman of the Irrigation Department with membership from
representatives of WRC, DRI, as well as SWRI of MALR; and a local coordinating
committee at the Governorate level chaired by the Undersecretary Irrigation
and as members Field Director of IIP, Undersecretary of Agriculture of MALR
and ISA Field Director. Issuance of the Ministerial Decree for establishing
such committees was a Condition of Board Presentation (para. 4.8)
8.4         With the above assurances, the Project would be suitable for a
Bank loan of US$26.7 million for a term of 20 years, including 5 years of
grace at the standard variable interest rate, and an IDA Credit of SDR35.7
million (equivalent US$53.3 million) for a term of 35 years, including 10
years of grace at standard IDA terms. The borrower would be the Government of
the Arab Republic of Egypt.

IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Aspects and Summary of Water Balance
Pooulation. Land Tenure and Farm Sizes
1.          Mahmoudia SubRroject.  The subproject area has a farming
population of about 235,000 people grouped into 33,500 farming households
(Annex 1. Table 1). The average family comprises about 7 persons of whom at
least four are active on the farm. The other family members are either at
school, when they are young, or working outside the farm to help bring
additional income to the family. Many small farming households rent or
sharecrop other land to provide employment for their family members and
increase their income. About 60 percent of the farms are owner operated, the
rest are either rented for cash (29 percent) or sharecropped (11 percent).
Farms are relatively large in this sub-project area; average farm sizes vary
from 0.5 feddan ( 1 feddan - 0.42 ha) for very small farms (24 percent) to 1.9
feddan for medium farms (33 percent) to 7.3 feddan for relatively large farms
(43 percent). Farm sizes and distribution is shown in Table 2.
2.            Manaifa SubRroiect. Of the three sub-project areas, Manaifa is
the most densely populated; its farming population is estimated at about
206,000 people, representing nearly 25,800 farm households ( Annex 1. Table
1). Average family size is at 8 persons per household and most family members
are active on the farm. As is the case for the other sub-project areas, farm
labor requirements are almost exclusively provided by the family. In this
area, 74 percent of farms are operated by their owners, 13 percent are rented
for cash and an equal proportion is sharecropped. Farms in subproject are
mush smaller than in the other two sub-project areas since 91 percent of all
farms have an average size of 1.9 feddan or less; average farm sizes vary
from 0.6 feddan for very small farms (49 percent) to 1.9 feddan for medium
farms (42 percent) to 5.9 feddan for large farms (9 percent). For details,
see Table 2.
3.          El Wasat Subproiect.  The farming population of the subproject
area is estimated to be about 213,000 people representing more than 35,500
farm households ( Annex 1. Table 1). The average family size is 6 persons per
household; it is smaller than the two other sub-project areas. Households
have more labor available than is required by their farming operation, they
therefore have one or more members working outside the farm supplementing the
family income. In El Wasat 89 percent of the farms are owner operated, 6
percent are rented and 5 percent are sharecropped. Average farm size varies
from 0.6 feddan for small farms (35 percent) to 1.5 feddan for medium farms
(42 percent) to 5.4 feddan for large farms (23 percent). Details are given in
Table 2.

Water Resources and Drainage Aspects
4.          Mahmoudia Subproiect.  Water is supplied to the Mahmoudia canal
serving a total net irrigable area of about 246,000 feddans from the Rasheed
branch of the River Nile at the left bank through El Atf pumping station.
There are three separate pumping stations at El Atf. Station No. 1 is the
oldest with six units and total output of 49 m3/sec. or 4.2 MCM/day. Station
No. 2 is a new station with six units and a total out put of 40 m3/sec. or
3.5 MCM/day. Station No. 3 is under construction and expected to be in
operation at the end of 1995, which will replace Station No. 1 and also has
six units with a total capacity of 71 m3/sec. or 6.15 MCM/day.   Mahmoudia
canal is about 75 km long and has also two supplemental sources of water.
First one is Edko drain reuse pumping station at km 8.85 with a maximum
capacity of 5.8 m3/sec or 0.5 MCM/day. The second source is in the tail
escape of El Khandak canal which discharges into Mahmoudia canal by gravity at
km 15.37 with a maximum capacity of 23 m3/sec or about 2 MCM/day during the
peak irrigation demand period.
5.          The subproject area of about 131,000 feddan is served by the
Mahmoudia canal from km 15 to km 44; and 23 secondary canals with a total
length of about 320 km.
6.          Drainage water from the Mahmoudia area on the right bank is pumped
to Abu Keir bay near Alexandria through El Tabia and Edko drainage pumping
stations. These two major stations receive the drainage water from three
secondary drainage pumping stations. On the left bank, drainage water is
pumped to the Mediterranean Sea through El Max drainage pumping station which
receives the drainage flow from four secondary drainage pumping stations.
Subsurface drainage has been installed in about 2/3 rd of the project area and
about ten percent of the area is now under implementation. The remaining 25
percent of the area will have sub-surface drainage installed by the end of
1997 under the National Drainage Project (NDP).
hanaifa SubRroiect
7.          The area is located on the northern edge of the Middle Delta
region just south of Lake Burulus and its source of water is El Bagouria main
canal with El Kadabba canal (18 km long) conveying the water to the area
through 24 secondary canals (150 km total length).
8.          Drainage water from the area is lifted at El Mandoura drainage
pumping station into Drain No. 9, which discharges into Lake Burulus. About
2/3rd of the area is covered with subsurface drainage and about 20 percent is
under implementation with remaining 15 percent expected to be completed by the
end of 1997 under NDP.

9.          El Wasat SubRroject.  Irrigation water is supplied to El Wasat
area through Meet Ya Zeed canal (24 km length) fed from Bahr Shebeen canal.
The water is distributed to the area through 29 secondary canals (210 km total
length).
10.         Drainage water from the area is pumped at pumping stations No. 7
and 8 and conveyed through drains No. 7 and 8 into Lake Burulus.   About 1/3
rd of the area is covered with subsurface drainage and additional 15 percent
is under implementation with remaining 50 percent is expected to be completed
by the end of 1998 under NDP.

IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
Detailed Features
Improvement of Delivery System (Base Cost USS20.1 Million)
1.          Most of the main and secondary canals have eroded sections
particularly downstream of existing structures and near populated areas. These
sections will be improved by either concrete lining or stone masonary walls
and grouted rip-rap. Existing deteriorated structures such as bridges would
be replaced. A very few cross regulator structures exist in the main and
secondary canals. Because of rotational flow, canal sections are adequate and
large enough to accommodate continuous flow which would require the
installation of automatic downstream control gates and control structures
upstream of these automatic gates. The canal sections would be able to cover
the night storage (difference between 24 hours and 16 hours operation of
canals). The location of control structures is determined on the basis of the
night storage between two control structures with a triangular wedge plus a
rectangular area created by additional flow allowed to pass the distribution
structures upstream of downstream control gates. Wherever required and
applicable, escape structures would be provided to waste the excess
flow/storage to the nearest drain. Modular distribution structures will also
be introduced at the head regulators of secondary canals.   Consultants
engaged under PHRD grant would review available night storage and proposed
locations of control structures in each secondary canal.
2.          A centralized telemetry system has been established under the
ongoing USAID assisted Irrigation Management System (IMS) program, which
enables the central stations located in selected Governorates to monitor and
operate major structures and pumping stations through a remote control
operation.   Such central stations have been established in both Baheira and
Kafr-El Sheikh Governorates, which would be linked with all new cross
regulating and existing head regulators of each subproject. This linkage
would facilitate the operation of main canals without any major modification.
3.          The water balance analysis (Annex I) indicates that there is a
deficit during peak months of June and July, which will be met by using the
drainage effluent through mixing with fresh water at predetermined levels in
reuse mixing pump stations. Location of these stations and their capacity
will be carefully reviewed after a comprehensive monitoring survey which the
Drainage Research Institute (DRI) has already started. The survey is expected
to be completed within two years before June 1996. The survey is more
critical for the Manaifa area which suffers the most deficit (about 30 million
cubic meters or 40 percent of requirement in the month of July). Each reuse
mixing station will be equipped with automatic gauges to ensure that the
salinity of mixed water will not exceed the tolerance of salinity for the
crops using the mixed flow (600 PPM for the rice crop). The project would
also provide for small pump stations to intercept the surface drainage flow
from rice paddies (draining of paddy fields at regular interval, a local
practice in Egypt) and pump it directly to the nearest secondary or tertiary
canal for reuse.

Tertiary System Development (Base Cost USS 96.2 Million)
4.          A single lift pumping station of 60 to 120 litre/sec capacity will
be installed with an average lift of about 2 to 3 m at the intake of each
tertiary lateral instead of a multiple lift system at each quaternary. This
arrangement would save energy and the high cost of private pumping by each
farmer. It would also help to ensure an equitable distribution of water,
reduce salinity at the tail-end, and provide sufficient quantity of water to
satisfy the leaching requirements. The tertiary lateral beyond the single
lift pumps will serve the service area by gravity.
.5.          The tertiary laterals will be improved through the provision of
either a lined section (pre-fabricated J. Section) or low pressure buried pvc
pipes with alfalfa valves for release of water to the farms or quaternary
lateral. As the farmers at each tertiary lateral will be given the choice of
selecting either pvc pipe or j.section, cost estimates are based on the
experience in USAID assisted project where 60 percent of the beneficiaries
opted for pvc pipe which has higher initial investment (about 20 percent
higher cost) but significant savings in the maintenance cost as well as land
saved from construction of tertiaries using pvc pipe or lined J sections which
adds to the farmers incremental production.   Under the IAS procedures 80
percent of the beneficiaries are required to agree on the choice of the type
of improvement. Provision is also made to implement a few tertiary laterals
using in-place concrete lining with lining machines, precast concrete
parabolic flumes (canallets) and precast concrete pipes on a trial basis.
Following is the estimated length of tertiary laterals for each subproject
based on the existing USAID assisted pilot project results:

Irrigation Advisory Service (IAS) - (Base Cost US$ 5.3 Million)
6.          According to the recently amended Irrigation law, WUGs would be
organized for each tertiary block (Meska). Although dictated by law, these
groups will be established through dialogue, persuasion and agreement of at
least 80 percent of the beneficiaries. WUGs would be organized taking into
consideration local conditions, water availability and users practices as well
as customs. According to the by-laws which will be issued soon, WUGs
organization process would follow following steps: (a) Preparation -



- 48 -
ANNEX II
Page 3 of 6
Information collection, inventory and condition of existing structures,
contacts with local leaders, individual farmers and other local organizations;
(b) Promotion - Awareness campaign among farmers, presentation of costs and
benefits of organization thus creating a broader support for WUGs. This would
involve audio-visual presentation and field visit to the pilot areas or areas
where IIP concept has been successfully implemented; (c) Organization -
Organize WUGs and registration with MPWWR and other agencies identified under
the by-laws, election of office bearers and training of WUGs leaders in WUG
management; (d) Participation - Presentation by IIP technical staff and IAS of
options for type of meska improvement i.e. PVC pipe or lined J-section, size
and type of pumps and an agreement by the majority of meska shareholders on
choice of improvements and pumps; (e) Operations - Training and technical
assistance for pumps operation and maintenance, water management aspects for
allocation of water, financial management and setting up procedures for
payments for the operational cost and recovery of investment cost.
7.          The formation of Water Users Associations (WUAs) or federation of
WUGs would follow the establishment of functioning WUGs on the basis of the
command area of a branch or sub-branch. Each WUG will elect a representative
for the WUA. Training and technical assistance would be an integral part of
the organizing process throughout the WUG and WUA formation activities.
8.          IAS will play a major role initially in organizing WUGs and later
in training members in operation and maintenance of tertiary laterals. In the
long-run, the IAS will provide: (a) information and technical support for
maintenance/repairs of laterals and for replacement/repairs of pumps; and (b)
training in financial management including procedures for charging WUG members
on a time basis for the use of water and ensuring recovery of cost for
maintenance of laterals, operation and repair cost of pumps; and the long-term
replacement cost of pumps. About 2650 WUGs would be organized by the IAS
during the project implementation period of seven years. Experience in
Indonesia where the size of holdings are less than 1.0 ha (73 percent of
project area farmers have similar size) show that such users groups are
successful if they are involved in the planning phase and have a feeling of
ownership of the system.
9.          Command area centers covering areas of about 6,000 to 10,000 fed
would be created. Each command area center will have building facilities of
about 250 m2 space where farmers will meet and from where IAS field staff will
operate. WUAs will be established covering about 3000 to 5000 fed areas and
would be based on service areas of secondary canals (branches and sub-
branches). Each command area center will serve a group of two or three WUAs.
WUAs would address inter-meska problems, coordinate water management problems
with IAS and provide assistance in linking farmers with external agencies
including private pump manufacturers and mechanics. Each WUG will be
represented in the WUA by an elected representative. The following is the
summary of WUGs and WUAs for each subproject and the staffing requirements for
IAS is given in Annex II, Table 1.

Institutional Support (Base Cost US$ 9.8 Million)
10.         The institutional support component is divided into three
subcomponents. The first one is technical assistance to support consultancy
services and operational support for the design and construction supervision.
The second is specialized services for various components such as environment,
M&E of a few well defined key indicators, on-farm irrigation management,
communication, cost sharing studies and IAS. The third is the training
aspects which would include an initial detailed study to define and identify
various needs of in-country training composed of on-the-job training,
workshops and seminars and overseas training including fellowships for
graduate studies in various fields closely connected with the project
components. The operational support would also include per diem and travel
allowance paid to the project staff which will ensure that the staff will
spend maximum time in the field and not limited to the Government restrictions
on such trips because of budgetary constraints.
11.         All of the surveys and field investigations for delivery system
and tertiary development, design and construction supervision will be carried
out by the IIPD staff through its headquarters in Cairo and its two field
offices. There will be a need for technical assistance for the IIPD staff in
carrying out these activities. International experienced international
consultants along with Egyptian professionals would be engaged to undertake
these services. The headquarters input would be a Team Leader, a procurement
expert, a telemetry engineer and a M&E expert together with a total input of
65 staff-months of international experts and about 150 staff-months of
Egyptian professionals. Provision is also made for socio-economic surveys
connected with M&E component. The field offices input would be in the
specialities of design, procurement specialist, M&E and a short-term telemetry
expert with a total input of 40 staff-months of international staff and
Egyptian professional engineers for construction supervision, design,
telemetry system (252 staff-months) including economists for M&E activities
with an input of about 18 staff-months of international and 78 man-months of
Egyptian Professionals both at the headquarters and in the field offices.
12.         Provision is made for technical assistance of international
consultants in the fields of environment, on-farm irrigation management,
communication, cost sharing studies and IAS (127 staff-months) with a joint
input of Egyptian professionals (385 staff-months). Consultants requirements
for various components is summarized in Annex II, Table 2 and staff
requirement in Table 3.

13.         The project would support a total input of about 18 staff-months
of expatriate and about 70 staff-months of local professionals to define the
training program and at later stages to undertake initially the development of
in-country specialized courses, workshops and seminars. Training input for
various components is summarized in Annex II, Table 4.
Environmental Assessment and Management (Base Cost US$1.2 Million)
14.         The environmental component would comprise: (a) the strengthening of
the environmental assessment and management capacity of MPWWR and IIPD through
specialized on-the-job training, specialized services, seminars and workshops; (b)
the development of guidelines for irrigation development; (c) monitoring of water
quality by DRI particularly in the reuse of drainage effluent and soil salinity at
the tail ends of the system; and (d) continued role of the Agriculture Extension
Service of MALR in educating the farmers in proper pesticide storing, handling,
use and associated health effects as well as in pest scouting. Provision would be
made for the procurement of vehicles, office and monitoring equipment, specialized
services for experts in the fields of reuse of drainage effluent, and management
of agro-chemicals. The project would also provide for in-country
workshops/seminars and overseas training and visits. Requirements for the
environmental aspects are summarized in Annex II, Tables 2, 4 and 5.
On-Farm Irrigation Management Demonstration Program - (Base Cost US$1.6 Million)
15.         This component is aimed at improving on-farm  irrigation management
and use through a demonstration program. The program would focus on demonstrating
proven technologies and transferring to farmers fields new technologies developed
by various ongoing research programs. These technologies include better land
levelling by conventional means or through laser levelling, use of gypsum or other
amendments to improve soil conditions and quality, irrigation scheduling, quantity
and size of irrigation stream, length and width of border strips etc. The project
would support the establishment of about 50 demonstrations spread over three
subprojects during seven years of project implementation. It is expected that
adoption of those technologies would: (a) improve water use efficiency; and (b)
improve agricultural production through the use of proven technologies. The
project would finance 80 percent cost of land levelling (about 2,300 feddan over
seven years), soil amendment and production inputs, water management and
laboratory equipment. Provision would also be made for specialized services and
training of the participating staff. Requirements for the on-farm water
management demonstration program is summarized in Annex II, Tables 2, 4 and 6.
Communications - (Base Cost US$3.3 Million)
16.         A systematic program of communication aimed at the general rural
public and at project area farmers will be the primary focus of this component.
The program will stress the importance of water conservation, to the general rural
public and improved services, productivity

ANNEX II
Page 6 of 6
gains and need for cost sharing. The communications program would cover the above
themes through a series of campaigns, selection of a mix of media, formulation of
messages, pilot testing and expansion to a wider area.
17.         The central objective of communication at the Minisry level is aimed
at the general public, legislators and policy makers and the engineers in the
Ministry to build awareness and action on the scarcity of the water resources and
the need to conserve by stressing the importance of conserving Nile waters and
preserving water quality and by providing relevant information invoking
individual responsibility and stressing the need for cost recovery. The project
would provide for vehicles, communication and office equipment, training materials
in Arabic, specialized services of communication experts, editors, in country
workshops/seminars, overseas visits by policymakers and managers and funds
required for various awareness campaigns through various mass media coverage.
Requirements for this component are summarized in Annex II, Tables 2, 4 and 7.
18.         The objective of communication aimed at the project area farmers would
be to strengthen awareness of project benefits, including water conservation and
environmental issues and train them in the operation and maintenance of meska and
financial management. A baseline survey will be carried out to determine farmers
perception on various aspects which would be used as a basis of developing a
structural communication campaign to reach the target area farmers.
The project would provide the required consultancy in the initial years for
baseline survey, development of the program and a detailed work plan as well as
assessment of the impact on the target audience at the mid-term (fourth year) of
project implementation. The project areas communication will be carried out by the
specialized staff of IAS. Provision would be made for the communication
equipment, specialized services, funds for in-country awareness campaign and
overseas visits by policy makers and managers. Requirements for this component
are summarized in Annex II, Tables 2, 4 and 8.
