N    DONUN AND RECOEATION OF THE  ISD T QF THE
INTERNATIONAL BAhK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMEN
AND THE INTERATIONA.L DEOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED L)h/ClREDIT T THUE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYP$ FOR THE
IRRIGATION Imam=O PIECT            
1,     Tme following mmorandus and reo       _ endation on a proposed loan for
US$26.7 million and a credit for SDR 35.7 million, to the Arab Republic of
Egypt is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for 20 years,
incltuding five years of grace. The credit would be on standard IDA teras with
a maturity of 35 years, including 10 years of grace at the standard IDA terms.
-*The loan/credit would help finance the Irrigation Improvement Project for -
three irrigation command areas serving a total net irrigable area of about
248,000 feddans (104,000 ha).
2       Backgrouhd.  Agriculture occupies a dominant position in the Egyptian
economy, accounting for 20 percent of GDP, 35 percent of the labor force and
20 percent of merchandise export earnings. The land base for agricultural
production consists of 7.5 million feddan (2.0 million ha) of arable,
irrigated land. Irrigated farming in Egypt is supported by one of the world's
largest single river basin systems, extending 1,200 km from the High Aswan Dam
to the Mediterranean coast.
3.      Perennial irrigation, made possible by construction of the High Aswan
Dam, coupled with high usage of modern inputs and multiple cropping, made the
land resource highly productive. Measures are still needed for the efficient
use of the sector's single most important limiting resource, water, and the
adoption of financially sustainable programs for maintaining the irrigation
and drainage network. Therefore, improved efficiency in on-farm irrigation is
a major strategic objective.
4.      Rationale for Bank/IDA Involveuent . Bank assistance strategy in
Egypt, which was presented to the Board on March 24, 1994, during the
presentation of the Agricultural Modernization Project (Report No. P-6203-
EGT), accords high priority to financing projects which focus on environmental
and sustainability issues and on poverty alleviation. As pointed out in the
Environmental Action Plan Report for Egypt, the supply of water from the Nile
River is limited, and the only way to meet the increased demand is by
conservation through more efficient use by agriculture. The Goverrment' 
environmental strategy gives the highest priority to conserving water
resources. The Agriculture Sector Strategy has underscored the importance of
increasing the efficiency of water use and reliability of water services as an
important objective. The project would address these concerns. The project
would mainly benefit small holder communities with average land holding below
1.9 feddan (0.8 ha). It would not only help increase the income of this
target group, but also will have significant replication potential for 6
million feddans currently under irrigated agriculture in Egypt.  Through the
project, the Bank would play an important role by assisting the Government in
promoting water use efficiency and energy saving measures. The Government
also looks to the Bank to provide technical leadership in designing a long-
term irrigation improvement program. The Bank can play an effective role
similar to its role in the drainage program which has been under
implementation over the past 20 years and which has resulted in providlng on-
farm drainage on about three million feddans.



-2
Lessons Learned.
5        Much has been-learned about the problems of the subsector during the
Bank's long and substantial involvement with drainage, a channel maintenance
and two pumping stations rehabilitation projects. The first five drainage
projects and first pumping station rehabilitation project experienced
inglementation delays of two to -three years, pr1marily due to delayed
effectiveness and overly optimistic implewentation schedules. The principal
findings of the Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR) for these projects
are: (a) the Implementation period should consider delaying factors, such as
the lengthy periods required for procurement, and the civil works schedules -
should be based on a more realistic implementation capacity; and (b) technical
assistance should be sought from bilateral grant sources as the Goverrmont is
reluctant to use loan funds for consultants.
6.      The Government is liplementing a pilot project of irrigation
Improvement in six Governorates with USAID assistance. Technical and
institutional concepts introduced in the pilot project will be incorporated in
the proposed project. USAID recently carried out a detailed evaluation of its
pilot program for the Irrigation Improvement Project in November 1993. The
purpose of t1e evaluation was to assess the progress, evaluate the
effectiveness and provide guidance for more effective implementation
activities. The assessment indicates that the project is continuing to
achieve its goals, purpose and objectives satisfactorily but has not reached
its ambitious level of planned output. The specific findings and
reconamendations of the evaluation are: (a) to promote sustainability, a cost
sharing program with beneficiaries is essential; (b) there is a lack of staff
to accomplish project goals; (c) tripartite coordination between the farmers,
Irrigation Advisory Service (IAS) and agriculture extension for improvement of
water conservation and yield is lacking; and (d) the construction program is
behind schedule mainly due to late start and lack of experience of
construction contractors, which requires proper selection and supervision of
contracts. The Government has also obtained a grant of about US$ 0.5 m.illion
from the Japanese policy for human resources development (PHRD) fund to assist
in the institutional aspects and preparation for implementation of the
project.
7.      In order to address those weaknesses in implementation, actions were
agreed to: (a) organize water users' groups (WUGs) for the works to be
implemented during initial two years under a PHRD grant mentioned above, and
prepare bidding documents for tender processing before project effectiveness
to facilitate a rapid start-up of implementation; (b) further technical
assistance would be financed through financing from KfW and NDGIC, which would
enable the project to proceed smoothly with timely expert input in various
components of the project; (c) cost sharing arrangements are in place under
the recently amended Irrigation Law, which is a breakthrough, and would help
in promoting future sustainability; (d) on-farm irrigation management
demonstration program would ensure tripartite coordination between farmers,
IAS and agriculture extension and (e) prequalification of local and foreign
contractors under ICB procedures for civil works would ensure participation by
experienced and qualified contractors.
8.      Proiect  Objectives.  The overall objectives of the project are to:
(a) increase agriculture production and farm incomes through the provision of



-3-
an improved Irrigation service; (b) reduce water use through increased
distribution efficiency and on-deimand water availability; (c) transfer full
responsibility for the O&M of the tertiary system to farmers so as to relieve
the financial burden on the Government and improve motivation and
accountability; (d) promote improved communications amongst the farming
community, technical staff, general public and policy makers by carrying out a
systematic awareness campaign in promoting water use efficieency and cost
sharing arrangements; and (e) strengthen the Ministry of Public Works and
Water Resources (NPWR) institutional capacity for planning and Implementation
In the irrigation sector.
9.      Protect Descris2ron.  The proposed project comprises the improvement
of-three irrigation command areas serving a total taet irrigable area of
248,000 feddan (104,000 ha). The subprojects are Nahmoudia (131,000 fed) in
Baheira Governorate, Manaifa (42,000 fed); and El Wasat (75,000 fed) in Kafr
El Sheikh Governorate. Existing delivery system of main and secondary canals
will be improved and provided with control structures, telemetry system and
mixing stations installed for reuse of drainage effluent. The tertiary system
in the project area will be developed with provision of single lift pumps and
lined or pvc pipe tertiary laterals. IAS will be established to organize and
train farmers into WUGs at tertiary level and water users associations (WUAs)
at the secondary level. Institutional support will be provided through a
communication component at the MPWWR and Project levels, technical assistance
for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) environmental aspects, on-farm irrigation
management demonstration program, and a training program both in country and
overseas.
10.     The project was identified and prepared by MPWWR which signifies
commitment and ownership and will be implemented with full participation of
beneficiaries. The project would be implemented by MPWWR over a period of
seven years. A project coordination committee has been set up in order to
expedits implementation. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$182.3 million with a foreign exchange component of US$94.7 million (52
percent). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A tlmetable of key project processing events and the status of
the Bank Group's operations in Egypt are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map and Staff Appraisal Report No. 13454-EGT, dated December
1, 1994 are also attached.
11.     Actions Aareed Durina NeMotiations.  The following are key assurances
which were obtained from the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt (GOE)
during negotiations: (a) the audited accounts together with the auditor's
reports, would be furnished to the Bank Group within nine months of the end of
each fiscal year; (b) the Water Research Center (WRC), in coordination with
the Ministry of Health (K0H), would prepare a short report on the prevalence
of Bilharzia disease and the use of molluscicides for the two Governorates
(Baheira and Kafr El-Sheikh) for the Bank Group's review each year; (c)
Irrigation Improvement Project Directorate (IIPD) would submit a detailed
progress report for the mid-term review, by December 31, 1998, and Section II
of the Implementation Completion Report not later than six months after the
loan closing date; and (d) cost sharing of investment cost for Neska
development will be based on recovery within five years for the cost of single
lift pumps and over a period of ten to twenty years based on farmers' capacity



-4-
to pay for other civil works starting from the timn of completion of these
improvements.
12.     The Government has taken the following actions to facilitate project
implementation: (a) issued a Ministerial Decree appointing experienced staff
to eight spectfied key posltions; and (b) established a technical coordinating
committee at the headquarters in Cairo and a local coordinating committee at
the Governorate level.
13.     *nvi*M  "Ml &Meta. The project has been placed in Environmental
screening category "BO consistent with O.D. 4.01. An environmental management
plan would be implemented to support institutional strengthening and training,
water quality monitoring and agricUltural chemical management. The project
would have a generally positive impact on the environment by improving water   -
use efficiency and protecting soil resources from waterlogging and
salinization in the irrigated areas.  Current use of drainage effluent with
high salinity contents during peak demand months will be controlled by mixing
drainage effluent with fresh water through the reuse pumping stations, thus
improving the quality of water.
14.     Payery. The project has been placed in poverty category OPTI  as it
will enhance the income of over 70 percent of the project beneficiaries with
holding-size less than 1.9 fed (0.8 ha) whose current farm Income is less than
relative poverty line and close to ultra-poverty line in Egypt.
15.     henefitg .  The project would primarily benefit about 95,000 farm
households, increasing their income by providing timely and adequate amount of
irrigation water. Through a participatory approach and organization of WUGs
the project would create a sustainable ownership of tertiary laterals by its
beneficiaries and would result in an estimated 34 percent savings in the
pumping cost of the irrigation water. The Economic Rate of Return for the
project is estimated at 25 percent.
16.    Risks. The major risks are: (a) limited implementation capacity of
domestic contractors which could reduce the area to be improved; and (b) delay
in design of improvement works and procurement processing.  These risks would
be minimized by: (a) prequalification of contractors and the provision of
technical assistance and training of contractors and IIPD staff; and (b)
advance actions on procurement and design work using PHRD grant funds.
17.     R*comendatlon. I am satisfied that the proposed loan/credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank/IDA and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan/credit.
