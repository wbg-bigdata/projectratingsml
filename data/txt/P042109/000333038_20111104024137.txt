F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
Visible and sustained alleviation of air and water pollution in Beijing by helping to: (a) convert
scattered coal-fired boilers to natural gas boilers; (b) promote energy conservation in heating
systems; (c) construct key wastewater trunk interceptors and associated treatment facilities; and
(d) strengthen environmental management institutions of Beijing.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
Not applicable

Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The GEF-financed components support activities (a) and (b) above, by helping to establish viable
models and markets of natural gas usage and heating energy conservation. In addition to the
direct and significant reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, these will make an effective
demonstration of GHG reduction measures for China as a whole and thus help to decrease the risk
of global climate change significantly.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The two most critical environmental issues in Beijing municipality, at project appraisal, were its
rapidly deteriorating water and air quality. Due to relatively scarce water resources, accelerating
urban construction, economic development, and escalating population growth, water quality was
a long-standing, major environmental issue for Beijing. At the time of project preparation, the
total volume of municipal wastewater generated from Beijing’s inner city and city fringe areas
(i.e., about 1,370 km2) was about 2.5 million m3/d of which only about a quarter was treated. The
Liangshui River catchment, which received more than 40% of the municipal wastewater
discharges, had no wastewater treatment facilities. As a result, the city’s natural streams had little
capacity to dilute pollutants from the large volume of wastewater discharges. Downstream flows
of urban streams were not suitable even for economic uses such as industrial cooling or irrigation.
To address these concerns, the Beijing Municipal Government (BMG) began a major
environmental improvement program to expand wastewater and solid waste management
capacities.
In 1998 Beijing’s air quality was continuing to deteriorate. The average annual ambient
concentrations of particulates and nitrates exceeded the daily healthy limit for residential areas
(Chinese standard Class II, similar to World Health Organization (WHO) standards) due to
increasing pollution emissions. During the heating season, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen
oxide levels posed acute health risks, as they exceeded the limits allowed even for industrial areas
(Class III). At appraisal, approximately 5.3 million Beijing residents in the urban central area
were exposed to more than 150 micrograms of sulfur dioxide (China Air Quality Standards of one
hour average in residential areas) for more than 60 days a year.
At that time, the main source of air pollution in Beijing was coal combustion, which was the
city’s dominant source of energy for heating and power supply (about 75%), and which
contributed most of the sulfur dioxide and a major share of other pollutants. Industrial boilers,
power plants, and scattered heating boilers, i.e., those with a capacity of less than 20 tons of
steam per hour (capable of heating up to 160,000 m2 of floor space) with chimneys lower than 35
meters, were the main sources of Beijing’s air pollution. The BMG strategy for air pollution
control was to: convert coal-fired boilers to natural gas boilers; strengthen regulatory and pricing
systems; invest heavily in natural gas supply infrastructure; strengthen emission control; and
close or relocate an increasing number of highly polluting industries out of the city. About 20%
of the Beijing urban area was designated as “Coal-free Zones? (also known as smoke-controlled
areas and mainly located in the city urban center) where no coal-burning devices under 20 tons
per hour were permitted after 1999.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The project development objective (PDO) was to achieve visible and sustained alleviation of air
and water pollution in Beijing by helping to: (a) convert scattered coal-fired boilers to natural gas
boilers; (b) promote energy conservation in heating systems; (c) construct key wastewater trunk
interceptors and associated treatment facilities; and (d) strengthen environmental management
institutions of Beijing.
Related key performance indicators agreed were: Beijing’s population exposed to air quality
(based on SO2 and NOx levels) worse than Class III over 60 days a year; carbon emission from
heating in Beijing; COD discharged to the Liangshui River; and net internal cash flow of Beijing
Drainage Company (see Annex 1).

                                                  1
1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The global environment objective, which was consistent with the PDO, was to support activities
(a) and (b) above, by improving efficiency, enhancing productivity, and promoting best practices
in natural gas utilization through the provision of international expertise, training, and
demonstration projects. The GEF support was designed to help: (a) establish viable models and
markets for the conversion of scattered coal-fired boilers to natural gas boilers; (b) set best-
practice models, standards and markets for the promotion of energy conversion in heating
systems; (c) achieve direct and significant reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; and (d)
make effective demonstration of GHG reduction measures for China as a whole.
Carbon dioxide released from heating systems was the agreed key performance indicator to
measure air pollution reduction.
1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO remained unchanged during implementation. Since carbon dioxide is not a parameter in
China’s monitoring protocol, monitoring data on carbon dioxide emissions was not available.
While it was possible to compute total carbon dioxide emissions based on coal utilization, carbon
emission attributable to heating alone could only be estimated. Two new indicators were
substituted instead to monitor air quality improvements for which the project's air quality-related
components served as a catalyst, namely: (i) annual average concentration of major pollutant—
SO2 only; and (ii) number of days Beijing’s population exposed to air quality worse than Class II.
No additional water-related indicator was introduced during the project implementation, despite
the addition of seven subcomponents at project restructuring.
1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The global environment objective remained unchanged during project implementation. As stated
in Section 1.4 above, the sole GEO indicator relating to carbon emissions deleted because it was
not possible to separate coal consumption in heating systems from that used in industry and
power generation.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries of wastewater pollution abatement and air quality improvement, at project
start in 2000, were 3.2 million residents in the Liangshui River and Qing River drainage
catchments, and about 5.3 million residents in the urban central area of Beijing, respectively. In
addition, people living downstream of the river catchments in Hebei Province and Tianjin
Municipality, were also expected to benefit from the investments.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)
As summarized below, the project addressed the two main pollution issues of Beijing: wastewater
management and air pollution.
Wastewater Management (Appraisal cost: US$ 332.85 million): (Component outputs intended
to reduce pollution discharges, and improve surface water quality in river systems)

    •   Liangshui River Sewers (US$ 88.21million). Construction of about 48 kilometers of
        trunk sewers to intercept wastewater discharging to watercourses in the Liangshui River
        drainage catchment

            Comprehensive institutional development including policy actions, technical assistance
            and training to improve technical and project management support
Air Pollution Control (Appraisal cost: US$ 458.87 million): (Component outputs were
intended to improve air quality, promote efficient use of natural gas and improve heating energy
conservation)

      •     Boiler Conversion (US$ 417.37million). Conversion of about 2,000-2,500 small and
            medium-sized coal-fired boilers, (1 ton/hour-10 ton/hour), by providing financing
            (US$ 165 million of Loan) to import gas boilers for sale to boiler house owners
      •     GEF-supported Gas Boiler Market and Technology Development (US$ 27.14 million).
            Support for technology development, capacity building, market development, and
            demonstrations to overcome major barriers to conversion to natural gas (about US$ 16
            million of Grant)
      •     GEF-supported Heating Energy Conservation (US$ 11.17 million). Support for
            activities for general overall sustained energy efficiency improvements in heating
            systems, and specifically in the remaining large coal-fired boilers (about US$ 9 million of
            Grant)
      •     Air Quality Monitoring and Decision Support (US$ 3.19 million). Assistance to
            improve the ability of BMG to acquire, analyze and use information on air quality and
            pollution sources for timely policy and planning, by financing equipment, software for
            monitoring, analysis, simulation, evaluation and training
1.8 Revised Components

By the 2003 mid-term review, Loan savings of about US$ 150 million had accumulated mainly
due to policy adjustment, financial incentives and availability of various funding sources/channels
for boiler conversions, after Beijing was selected to host 2008 Olympic Games. Project
components were revised through amendment of legal agreements in August 2006, as described
below.
Wastewater and Water Environment Improvement Components. Seven new water environment
improvement subcomponents, estimated to cost US$ 366.06 million, were added, with the aim of
improving the water environment and water quality of the relevant river sections by at least one
level of the Chinese water quality standard. The new subcomponents were consistent with the
PDO, and were appraised by the Bank during project implementation after the mid-term review,
and no new indicators were added. The seven subcomponents were:
  •       River Rehabilitation: three water environment rehabilitation subcomponents in: (i) the
          North Moat and the northern reaches of the Liangma River; (ii) the lower reaches of the
          Qing River; and (iii) the Liangshui River section (Dahongmen Sluice Gate-BDA No. 1
          Dam), including automatic water quality monitoring, studies and project management
          (US$ 164.50 million) (Subcomponent output intended to enhance the PDO)




                                                    3
  •   Chaoyang District Water Environment Rehabilitation: the Two-lake Connection Canal;
      rehabilitation of the Ba River, the Beixiao River and the Xiaotaihou River; and institutional
      strengthening (US$ 139.91 million) (Subcomponent output intended to enhance the PDO)
  •   Xinfeng River Rehabilitation in Daxing District: rehabilitation of the Xinfeng River,
      including flow regulation, automatic water quality monitoring, associated works and
      project management support (US$ 23.79 million) (Subcomponent output intended to
      enhance the PDO)
  •   Water Re-use Project: a reclaimed water treatment plant of 20,000 m3/d capacity to supply
      water to industries in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area (BDA)
      (US$ 17.00 million) (Subcomponent output intended to conserve water resources in a
      sustainable manner)
  •   Reconstruction of a Solid Waste Transfer Station: reconstruction of the Datun solid waste
      transfer station with capacity of 1,800 tons/day (US$ 20.86 million) (Subcomponent output
      intended to improve the operational efficiency of solid waste service and prevent ground
      water contamination)
Boiler Conversion Component. The boiler conversion component was scaled down to 700
boilers from the originally planned 2,000; the total cost of the air pollution control component
reduced from US$ 417.37 million to US$ 37.36 million, and the loan allocation was reduced from
US$ 165 million to US$ 16.79 million.

1.9 Other significant changes

2008 Olympic Games. Beijing was selected to host the 2008 Olympic Games, three months after
Board approval of the project. Consequently, new government policy and changed priorities
necessitated accelerated construction of new facilities which, inter alia, required acceleration of
the boiler conversion program using new funding channels that were made available; and
improvement of facilities and water environment in the Games Village areas. The project was
restructured in 2003, to utilize the large amount of loan savings accrued, through expanding the
wastewater and river improvement component. Formal restructuring took place in 2006, after
receipt of the Borrower’s request.

Amendments to the Loan Agreements. The necessary amendments for the restructuring were
approved by the Board on August 24, 2006, on a ‘no-objection’ basis. The amendments: (i)
significantly reduced the air pollution component; (ii) substantially increased the wastewater
component, adding the seven new subcomponents described above; (iii) increased the
disbursement percentage for civil works from 40% to 75%; (iv) deleted the covenant that allowed
the Beijing Drainage Company (BDC) to retain wastewater revenues; (v) canceled US$ 26.51
million of the Loan; (vi) extended the Loan and Grant closing dates to March 31, 2009; and (vii)
reallocated Loan and Grant savings.

In November 2007, the Borrower requested more amendments to the Loan and Project
Agreements to: (i) reallocate the Loan proceeds among the categories of eligible expenditures and
increase the disbursement rate of categories (1) (a), (1) (b) and (1) (c) in paragraph 1 of Schedule
1 to the Loan Agreement to 100%; and (ii) cancel US$ 1.509 million of loan savings.

Amendments to the GEF Grant Agreement. The Grant agreement was amended on December 31,
2008 to: (i) to further extend the Grant closing date to January 31, 2010; (ii) enable completion of
the largest contract-the tri-generation of combined cooling, heating and power plant, intended to
demonstrate efficient and rational use of natural gas resources; and (iii) reallocate grant proceeds.

                                                 4
The Grant agreement was amended again in 2009 to: (i) utilize grant savings of US$ 2.3 million
to allow BMG to carry out a study and analysis of sustainable climate change mitigation models
and low-carbon economy development approaches to deal with the new challenges facing
Beijing; and (ii) extend the Grant closing date by a further year to January 31, 2011.

Reconstitution of Beijing Drainage Company (BDC). At appraisal, a traditional integrated
wastewater utility was envisaged with responsibility for this service in the urban area of BMG.
This was to be confirmed by an institutional study to be carried out under the project, and
implementation details were to be specified. BMG reviewed the results of the study, and proposed
to retain overall responsibility for the sector directly at the municipal level, with BDC
reconstituted as the Beijing Drainage Group (BDG), assigned limited responsibilities as one of
the operators in the sector (private companies operate some of the other facilities, e.g., wastewater
treatment plants), for a fee. The Bank accepted this alternative institutional arrangement as BMG,
a financially strong municipal government, would be better able to ensure the provision of high
quality wastewater services (compared to BDC) by making up any gaps between service
provision costs (both capital and O&M costs) and revenues from wastewater charges.

The Board-approved restructurings comprised: (i) corrective restructuring to reduce SJET’s role
in the project due to its poor performance, delete some indicators and add new indicators; and (ii)
adaptive restructuring to reduce the size of the boiler conversion program, due to the new
Government policies and market forces, described in Section 2.2 (b).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The PDO and scope were consistent with BMG’s plans at the time and were also in line with the
emerging priorities to address Beijing’s water quality and air pollution issues. The project
supported some of the core objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), including
infrastructure, human resource development, environmental protection and rural development. In
addition, the project was consistent with the GEF Operational Program #5, promoting the
removal of barriers to energy efficiency and energy conservation.

Wastewater Management. Project design addressed the serious environmental issues of untreated
wastewater discharges and surface water quality in the river systems, which received nearly 40%
of the untreated municipal wastewater generated. It focused on the priority development areas in
the Liangshui River and the Qing River drainage catchments, which had high wastewater
discharges and low coverage of wastewater collection and treatment. Project design established
clear priorities and cost effective options to improve water quality in the city, and broader city-
wide water pollution abatement programs.




                                                       6
Project design also addressed institutional reform and sustainability through measures to
significantly enhance the autonomy of the BDC through consolidation of all wastewater assets
under its ownership, and full control and use of wastewater tariff revenues (see section 2.2).

Air Pollution Control. The air pollution control component was highly innovative, and addressed
a critical issue that faced Beijing. The project incorporated pioneering and essential inputs of gas
boiler technology, coal-to-gas conversion design, heating system efficiency, heating conservation
and energy audits to facilitate the emerging natural gas market. The scale of the commercial
operation was necessary in the absence of an existing market for natural gas boilers, even though
it carried significant risks. With the impending availability of natural gas in 1999, the Bank and
BMG agreed on an investment plan for coal-to-natural gas boiler conversion in 40 coal-free zones
within the third ring road and Shijingshan District. Project design addressed the key constraints of
launching a large fuel conversion program, including: (i) the small market size and industry
capacity; (ii) under-developed technical models and capacity; (iii) technical risks and technology
information gap; (iv) high operating costs; and (v) capital cost and funding constraints. The
project also addressed major constraints to: (i) promoting heating energy conservation; (ii)
developing the local energy efficiency market, through the introduction of energy audits, studies
and training to improve the data base, policy and institutional frameworks, demonstration
projects; and (iii) developing policy and strategies for air pollution control through developing an
adequate air quality monitoring and analytical capacity.

Institutional Model for Air Pollution Control. Lack of existing dealerships for natural
gas boilers and reluctance of the private sector to venture into the unknown territory led to the
decision to establish a government-owned project company - Shihuan Jietian Energy Technology
Corporation. Ltd. (SJET), to manage the commercial venture of boiler conversions and to
implement associated technical assistance, supported by the GEF grant. The project company was
to be the focal point to promote gas technology, heating conservation, market development, and
support implementation of the city and district regulations to discourage coal burning. The
foreseeable risks were mitigated with international management support to SJET, and a
significant amount of technical assistance on natural gas boiler technology and efficient natural
gas utilization.

M&E Framework. The design of the M&E framework and indicators were appropriate. Some
indicators for air quality improvements had to be deleted or amended to better reflect prevailing
conditions and feasibility of data collection.

Risks and Mitigation Measures Identified at Appraisal

Anticipated risks of the wastewater management component were assessed satisfactorily at
appraisal and appropriate mitigation measures were built into the project. The risks of rapid
growth of wastewater discharges outpacing treatment capacity, and delays in construction of
wastewater facilities due to counterpart financing or resettlement bottlenecks, were correctly
assessed as substantial, and were mitigated appropriately through development of realistic
financing and resettlement plans, with the assistance of international consultants, and support
from BMG leaders.
The principal risks of the air pollution control component were correctly identified.
Technological and financial risks associated with the developing gas boiler market were mitigated
through substantial technical assistance for gas boiler technology demonstration projects, capacity
building for local design institutes, and marketing. However, the risk of delay in boiler
conversions due to insufficient capacity or incentives for implementing agencies, though assessed

                                                 7
as substantial, was not mitigated, but proved to be inadequate to meet the expectations of the
private boiler houses. The challenges for a new company (SJET) to meet the challenges of its role
were not adequately recognized.
The key development that could not have been foreseen at project appraisal was the onset of
government campaigns to convert coal-fired boilers following the selection of Beijing, on August
29, 2000, as a candidate host for the 2008 Olympic Games i.e., three months after Board
presentation, followed by Beijing’s selection on July 13, 2001 to host the Games. BMG expanded
the scope of the boiler conversions to cover both a much larger geographical area, as well as
larger capacity coal-fired boilers. This accelerated and binding schedule overrode the gradual
boiler conversion process envisaged at appraisal, and resulted in the boiler conversion component
of the project to be substantially reduced as the private sector took over this massive time bound
task.
The risk that a different institutional model for BDC could emerge was not expected due to prior
agreements on the development of the sector. However, since the institutional study for
organizing wastewater services was to be carried out during project implementation, financial
performance covenants should have been developed for the sector as a whole, rather than for
BDC only.

2.2 Implementation

(a) Wastewater Management

Expansion of Wastewater and River Improvement Investments. Strong support from
government leaders, flexible implementing policies, and effective project management of the
wastewater component enabled the original wastewater activities to be implemented efficiently
and to achieve the targeted outcomes, thus allowing this component to be significantly expanded
at restructuring. A key factor was the good coordination among the different departments and
agencies; close and continuous consultations with the project affected persons, which
satisfactorily addressed grievances regarding compensation; and timely implementation of land
acquisition and resettlement.

BDC Institutional Development. Following the institutional study in April 2002, BMG
reconstituted BDC as the Beijing Drainage Group (BDG). BDG has demonstrated strong capacity
and high productivity in its business operations, and is considered a replicable model for China.

(b) Boiler Conversions
The 2008 Olympic Games. Selection of Beijing to host the 2008 Olympic Games was a catalyst
for the accelerated construction of infrastructure, and improvements to the environment and air
quality-all crucial to the success of the Olympic Games. Multiple measures and actions were
taken to improve air quality, including accelerated coal-to-gas boiler conversions, rehabilitation
of coal-fired boilers, relocation and closure of polluting industries, controls on vehicular traffic
movement, promotion of public transport, etc. The central government and BMG appropriated
additional funds to implement these measures and actions.
Favorable Financing Options and Simpler Procedures. Attractive financing and simplified
procedures became available for boiler conversions, to complete the conversions in preparation
for the Games. The certainty and large size of the market, the incentives and simplified approval
procedures generated significant interest among commercial boiler vendors, and an active market
for boiler conversions emerged quickly. The result was a significant drop in demand for project
financing for boiler conversions. Project and the non-project vendors completed 700 and 16,000

                                                  8
sets of boiler conversions, respectively, before the opening of the Olympic Games. Only about a
tenth of the loan allocated for boiler conversion was utilized.
Inadequate Capacity of SJET. SJET, a newly-established and under-resourced company, was not
able to meet the challenges of the task, or compete in the environment of the expanded and
accelerated boiler conversion market and the highly active private sector operating under more
favorable conditions. In the final analysis, SJET’s capacity to market natural gas was not a
significant factor for the project outcome because the project intervention in marketing boilers
had reduced to about 10% of the project cost. The project’s grant technical assistance
implemented by HECC after transfer from SJET, however, was the dominant contribution to
project outcomes due to its highly catalytic role for the entire boiler conversion program of BMG.
Air Quality in Beijing. Air quality emerged as a priority to assure the success of the Games and
BMG made additional investments outside the project to complement project activities on air
quality monitoring, i.e., the establishment of ten automatic air quality monitoring stations, and the
Air Quality Monitoring and Decision Support System (AQMDSS), financed under the project.

(c) GEF Grant-supported Components

Gas Boiler Technology and Market Development. As SJET was not effective in implementation
of the project technical assistance, at the mid-term review in 2003, the Heating Energy
Conservation Center (HECC) was made responsible for implementation of the remaining
technical assistance activities for gas boiler market, technology development and heating
conservation. Some delay in implementation occurred as: (i) HECC was not familiar with the
Bank’s ICB procurement procedures, (ii) the complex design and bid document preparation, and
(iii) the time-consuming domestic approval procedures.

Heating Energy Conservation. At the mid-term review, this component was adjusted to: (i)
address issues in the whole heating system, from heat sources to buildings; and (ii) change the
focus of the pilot and demonstration project from small and medium coal-fired boilers to large
coal-fired and gas heating systems, and enlarge pilot and demonstration schemes. At the second
amendment to the Grant agreement, the tri-generation combined cooling, heating and power plant
was added to demonstrate efficient and rational use of natural gas resources.

Climate Change and Low Carbon Economy Study. With the agreement of the Bank and GEF, a
study on climate change and low carbon economy development was carried out using Grant
savings available at the end of 2009.

Grant Utilization. The grant was almost fully utilized. The unutilized balance of US$ 200,000
was canceled at grant closure.

Compliance with Financial Covenants

(a) SJET. A project covenant required SJET “to sell natural gas boiler equipment at prices and
    installments terms that could cover all reasonable expenses it incurred for sale and installment,
    including the cost of equipment, transportation insurance, management, all financing
    expenses, as well as reasonable provision for bad debts and profits?. This covenant was
    deleted at project restructuring with the substantial reduction in the boiler conversion
    component.

(b) Beijing Drainage Group. Based on the Borrower’s request, the Bank deleted, on February 4,
    2008, the project covenant that required wastewater tariff revenues to be retained by BDG.

                                                 9
    The wastewater sector in Beijing has been, and continues to be, financially sustainable, taking
    into account revenues from wastewater tariffs and funding provided by BMG. Financial
    covenants applicable to BDG on cost recovery and debt service coverage ratio became no
    longer relevant under the institutional arrangements in place.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The M&E framework was well designed to capture the project’s impact on air and water quality,
incorporating highly appropriate and sufficient indicators, such as: SO2 concentration; number of
days Beijing population was exposed to air quality worse than Class II standard; COD discharges
to the Liangshui River; progress in physical and financial expenditures by component; and
resettlement implementation. Monitoring and evaluation was to be carried out primarily through
monitoring the agreed outcome and output performance indicators, which were reported in the
semi-annual progress reports, prepared by the Beijing Project Management Office (BPMO) in
collaboration with the implementing agencies and the Beijing EPB.
Some monitoring indicators, selected at appraisal, could not be measured satisfactorily because of
way information is collected in China’s monitoring protocol. Data on coal consumption for
heating and other uses was not available disaggregated. Moreover, a methodology was not
available to measure fuel consumption per heating area. The task team realized these difficulties
early in the project, and more appropriate and practical performance indicators (KPI) were
adopted in a timely manner.

The air quality monitoring system developed under the project helped to monitor the impact of
the air pollution control interventions and provide BMG and the public daily air quality
information and health advisories, as necessary. The monitoring information was utilized to:
support policy and actions to enhance air pollution reduction measures; make investment plans to
further reduce pollution discharges to the river system; and accelerate project implementation and
management.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

(a) Social Safeguards. Resettlement activities were carried out satisfactorily in accordance with
Chinese regulations and World Bank policies. External monitoring of safeguards implementation
was carried out in accordance with the legal agreements. Annual safeguards compliance reports
prepared by the project implementing units were submitted regularly. The comprehensive
Resettlement Completion Report (RCR), submitted at the end of 2008, concluded that:
resettlement implementation was successfully completed with the full participation of the affected
persons; their standards of living had improved; and there were no outstanding resettlement issues
at project closure. See Annex 6 for more details.
(b) Environmental Safeguards. The project was correctly assessed as a Category “A? project,
and a comprehensive environmental assessment was carried out in accordance with the policies
and procedures of China and the World Bank. All the implementing agencies established
independent environmental management teams that were responsible for implementation,
supervision and monitoring of the Environmental Management Plans (EMP). Emergency
response plans for environmental pollution were also prepared to guarantee environment
protection at the construction sites. Specific environmental protection measures adopted were
adequate, and included staffing and training, dust control, noise control, and disposal of sludge.
During supervision, the Bank specialists recommended further improvements to environmental
standards on a case-by-case basis, particularly, the management of sediment from river dredging.
Internal and external environmental monitoring results have confirmed that through efficient
implementation of the EMPs, the adverse environmental impacts resulting from the project

                                                10
construction were mitigated and controlled to acceptable levels. There were no complaints on
environment issues throughout the project implementation period.
(c) Financial Management. Appropriate financial management arrangements were put in place
to ensure proper use and accounting of project funds. Financial management was carried out
satisfactorily, and no significant issues arose during implementation.
(d) Procurement. Procurement activities were carried out satisfactorily by all agencies. BPMO
and PIUs improved their procurement capacity progressively during project implementation.
Some useful lessons emerged, e.g., the need for improved quality of detailed designs and bidding
documents, and the need for closer communication among the project PIUs, the Ministry of
Commerce (MoC) and the Bank task team, to avoid delays in bid evaluations for ICB
procurement of equipment.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

With the availability of increased volumes of natural gas, the coal-to-gas boiler conversion has
continued since Loan closing and is expected to proceed further with private and government
funding. HECC plans to expand energy audits, and conduct training programs on gas technology,
energy audits, and heating energy conservation, at the training center set up with GEF support.
HECC has a core of competent professionals, and will continue to be adequately funded by an
annual operating budget from BMG. It will play a key role as a resource center and provide
available information on gas boiler technology, technical support for boiler conversion design,
heating energy conservation, and energy audits and efficiency improvements.
BDG is well managed, staffed, and is assured of financial support from BMG, as necessary. BDG
expects to increase the collection and treatment rate of wastewater generated from about 22
million people (both citizens and transient populations) in Beijing, and to improve the operational
efficiency of the wastewater facilities through the use of the Geographic Information System-
based management information system installed under the project. BDG will make further efforts
to fully utilize the treated wastewater, through contracts with industries and other potential users.
The Beijing Municipal Water Affairs Bureau and the District Water Affairs Bureaus are expected
to enhance their monitoring of water quality as stipulated by the national standards and
management capacities to maintain water quality, flows and flood control, primarily during the
rainy season.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory

The PDO and GEO were fully consistent with national and municipal priorities for improving
water quality and flows in the major rivers and streams, improving air quality, and reducing
greenhouse gas emissions in Beijing. The PDO was also consistent with the World Bank’s
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of 2000, with respect to safeguarding the environment and
reducing infrastructure bottlenecks. Eleven years later, the PDO remained highly relevant with
the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of 2006, especially with respect to pillar three, on
managing environmental challenges.

During project implementation, the focus of the PDO shifted significantly from reducing air
pollution to alleviation of water pollution, when the boiler conversion component was down-sized

                                                 11
at the project restructuring early in the project. Expansion of the wastewater and river
improvement investments utilizing loan savings contributed to a higher removal rate of COD per
year, and helped improve surface water quality in the rivers by one level, from worse than Class
V or Class V to Class IV and Class III, in most of the river sections.

The GEF grant-financed technical assistance was highly relevant to enhance the PDO through: (i)
support for boiler conversions, and transfer of technology for boiler conversion and efficient
heating conservation; (ii) demonstration of efficient and rational use of natural gas in combined
cooling, heating and power generation; and (iii) development of policy, strategies and action
plans to address climate change, and low carbon economy development.

The relevance of the PDO, project design and implementation arrangements, complemented with
GEF technical assistance, contributed to the satisfactory achievement of the PDO and GEO.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory

PDO Achievements

Air Quality. The project set the stage for the private sector to take over the emerging market for
delivery of small and medium size natural gas boiler conversions. Despite the project not
achieving the target of 2,000 natural gas boiler conversions, PDO achievement is rated
satisfactory based on the visible improvement in air quality, resident’s appreciation of the
improvements, the 70% reduction of SO2 emissions from 1998 to 2009 (120 ug/ m3 to 36 ug/ m3),
and the recorded 285 days per year with good air quality of Class II standard or better, in 2009,
compared to 265 days/year when the population was exposed to air quality worse than Class III in
1998.

Wastewater. Achievement of the PDO for the wastewater component under the original
wastewater component was satisfactory: untreated wastewater discharges of 780,000 m3 /day to
the Liangshui River were stopped; and COD discharged to the Liangshui River was reduced from
72,000 tons/year in 2000 to 26,000 tons/year in 2009. Surface water quality of the upper reaches
of the Laingshui and Qing Rivers improved from worse than Class V to Class III/IV in most
sections.

Pictures below illustrate conditions in the North Moat, before and after project:




                                                12
Outcomes of the new added subcomponents for water environment improvements (in Liangma
River, lower reaches of the Liangshui and Qing Rivers, Ba River, Beixiao, Xiaotaihou and
Xinfeng River) were: reduced pollution discharges to the rivers, improvement of river water
quality from Class V or worse than Class V, to Class III in some sections, and to Class IV in
others; and reduced flood damage through river channel improvements; and environment
improvements resulting in improved amenities and enhanced land prices. Specifically, outcomes
for the Ba River and the Beixiao River in Chaoyang District were: reduction of wastewater
pollution from about three million m3 per year of wastewater that would have otherwise entered
the rivers; avoided flood damage to nearly 270,000 people through increase of the flood
protection standard from 1:10 years to 1:20 years and 1:50 years in some sections of the rivers;
and improved amenities along the rivers, and enhanced land prices.

Additional achievements in protection and sustainable use of water resources were: the increased
supply of treated wastewater to industry through the construction of a 20,000 m3/day water re-use
plant; and protection of groundwater through improvements in solid waste management.

GEO Achievements

Outcomes of the Grant were satisfactory and opportune, coming at the time when natural gas
utilization was expanding, and there was a vast technology gap on gas boiler technology; and
coal-to-gas boiler conversion was adopted as the strategy to address the deteriorating air quality
in Beijing. Achievements of the Grant support comprised efficiency improvements, enhanced
productivity and best practices in natural gas utilization, including: (i) demonstrations for boiler
market development; (ii) introduction of viable models for the emerging boiler conversion
market; (iii) introduction of best practices in gas technology, coal-to-gas boiler conversion design,
including training; (iv) introduction of heating energy conservation as an essential element of the
rational and efficient use of natural gas, and energy audits; (v) development and financing of an
efficient combined cooling, heating and power plant (CCHP) in collaboration with a private
entity; and (vi) establishment of a training center for gas boiler technology and design, energy
audits, and best practices in heating conservation.

Institutional Achievements

The project succeeded in strengthening the capacity of: (i) BDG, for project design and
management, operation and maintenance of the entire wastewater system, use of a GIS-based
operation and management information system, and operation as a fee based service provider to
BMG; (ii) HECC, as a resource center for all aspects of gas boilers, energy audits and a training
center for the boiler industry; (iii) Beijing EPB, for air quality monitoring, data analysis,
projections, and health warnings, using a state-of-the art Air Quality Monitoring and Decision
Support System; and (iv) five design institutes with expertise in gas boiler conversion design.

Other Achievements

Sustainable Water Re-use. The project contributed to water resource conservation in a
sustainable manner through financing a water re-use plant for supply to industry.

Climate Change, and Energy and Environment Studies. Technical assistance studies provided
BMG: (i) options for managing the long-term municipal energy demand and supply, and address
environmental impact of high energy consumption; and (ii) policy and strategies for low carbon
economy development for key urban infrastructure sectors, demonstrations and specific actions.


                                                 13
Timely Project Restructuring. The need for a major project restructuring was identified in a
timely manner, following the mid-term review in 2003, when it became clear that the air quality
component would have substantial loan savings. The restructuring was completed after a
comprehensive appraisal of the new investments proposed by Government.

Achievements of the PDO and GEO were measured through the following key performance
indicators agreed at project appraisal, and those that were adjusted during the project
implementation. See Data Sheet and Annex 1 (Additional Indicators of Project Outcome).

3.3. Efficiency

Economic Analysis

Rating: Satisfactory

Cost-benefit analysis was conducted at appraisal for both boiler conversion and wastewater
components. However, it was not possible to compare the appraisal assessment with the end of
project assessment because: (i) the major restructuring of August 2006 significantly altered the
project’s composition and impact; and (ii) it is extremely difficult to quantitatively separate and
assess the contributions of the project to the significant economic and environmental benefits
achieved in Beijing from other environmental improvements undertaken by BMG.

Boiler conversion. As the total number of 700 gas-fired boilers procured to replace coal-fired
boilers through the project was lower than the appraisal target of 2,000, the overall emission
reduction and air quality improvement directly attributable to the project is well below original
estimates. However, the overall air quality improvement in Beijing as a result of the heating fuel
switching program undertaken by government during the life of the project is substantial and the
public health benefit is very significant. The overall cost and benefit of the air quality
improvement can be assessed, but is beyond the scope of the ICR.

Wastewater. Wastewater treatment and river rehabilitation subcomponents brought economic
benefits including flood control, environment and health improvements, as well as amenity and
land value increases. The river rehabilitation investments in the Ba River and the Beixiao River in
Chaoyang District significantly improved the water quality by intercepting 3 million m3 of
wastewater each year. They also raised the flood control standard from 1:10 years to 1:20 to 1:50
years, depending on river sections, protected 270,000 local residents, and avoided potential flood
damage of up to RMB 50 billion (US$ 7.7 billion) per flood event. The project improved the
amenity value along the rivers and increased land and property values; e.g., the price of real estate
in Dongba Jiayuan (a residential neighborhood of Chaoyang District) increased from RMB
2,800/m2 (US$ 431/m2) before the project to RMB 8,500/m2 (US$ 1,308/m2) after the completion
of the river rehabilitation subcomponent. Excluding the price impact of other factors, it is
estimated that the river rehabilitation works contributed to an increase in property values of a
minimum of RMB 2,000/m2 (US$ 308/ m2).

Implementation Efficiency. Taking into account the complexity of the project, and the major
restructuring that became necessary at the time of the mid-term review due to external reasons,
implementation efficiency is considered satisfactory. The original wastewater components were
completed by the mid-term review in 2003, when the boiler conversion component was scaled
down. The seven new subcomponents added in 2006, were completed by late 2009. The
combined cooling, heating and power generation plant, agreed in 2008, was completed at the end


                                                 14
of 2010; and the Study of Climate Change and Low Carbon Economy Development was
completed during the last one-year extension of the Grant.

Financial Analysis

BMG increased wastewater tariffs several times during project implementation, most recently in
December 2009. At project appraisal, the wastewater tariff for residential consumers in Beijing
was RMB 0.30/m3. This tariff was increased to RMB 0.90 m3 (US$ 0.14/m3) and RMB 1.04/ m3
(US$ 0.16/ m3) in December 2008 and December 2009, respectively. BMG intends to increase
wastewater tariffs to meet the full cost of wastewater collection and treatment in a phased manner.
BMFB allocates funds to BDG as a treatment fee to cover the cost of O&M of the network and
wastewater treatment, based on the volume of wastewater treated, and retains responsibility for
all sector debt service obligations, including loans from the World Bank, JBIC, and the Asian
Development Bank. The current new institutional and financial arrangements have made the loan
financial covenants (that BDC generate revenue from wastewater and drainage operations
sufficient to cover operation expenses and the greater of either depreciation charges or debt
service payments) irrelevant.

Table below summarizes the funds flow for the operation of wastewater treatment by BDG.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

Air Pollution Control. Even though the number of natural gas boilers marketed through the
project was only about a third of what was planned, a ‘satisfactory’ rating is justified because the
project was a pioneer intervention in promoting coal-to-gas boiler conversion, providing gas
boiler technology, and contributing to the initial development of the gas boiler market through
information campaigns and providing market reference prices through ICB procurement.
Assistance to build Beijing’s heating energy conservation capacity through HECC was also
fruitful, since HECC became a designated branch of the government in 2004. The project
developed best practice technologies for heating energy conservation; supported demonstration of
efficient gas boilers and more efficient tri-generation technology; enhanced the capacity of design
institutes for boiler conversion design, introduced energy audit demonstrations; and raised public
awareness. Based on data available on reduction in the use of coal for heating boilers, SO2
emission and increased number of days with satisfactory air quality, the PDO and GEO were
substantially achieved.
Water Quality Improvement. Water quality and management in the main rivers were improved
by expanding the collection and treatment of wastewater, controlling river flows and installing
flood control measures, and generally, improving the water environment. Water quality standard

in the rivers was increased by one level, in most river sections from Class V to Class IV. The
institutional model adopted for BDG has enabled the achievement of sector development
objectives i.e., to ensure a satisfactory quality of service at the lowest cost, and recover full costs
in the long-term, in a phased manner through periodic tariff increases.

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project did not contain specific poverty alleviation, gender or social development initiatives.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Overall responsibility for the wastewater service rests with BMG, with BDG and other operators
each operating and maintaining a part of the Beijing wastewater facilities for a fee from BMG
based on wastewater volume treated. This institutional model is working satisfactorily, and
service provision is satisfactory (see also section 1.9).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome

Rating: Low or Negligible

China has a made a strong national commitment to improve the environment, as reflected in the
five year plans. Efforts to improve air quality in Beijing are therefore certain to continue, and the
risk that air quality in Beijing will deteriorate is low. The central government and BMG are
expected to: continue programs to reduce pollution emissions from industries; expand the use of
natural gas in Beijing through continuation of the coal-to-natural gas boiler conversions; improve
efficiency in the remaining coal-fired heating units; introduce measures to control automobile
emissions: and mainstream experience from the boiler conversions and heating energy
conservation demonstration pilots.

With the high priority and financial support given to improving water quality by BMG, the risk
that water quality will deteriorate is also low. BMG is expected to continue cost recovery for
wastewater services in a phased manner, and ensure that BDG delivers quality service at the least
cost.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

                                                  16
Rating: Satisfactory

Quality at entry of this complex and ambitious project was satisfactory despite the challenges and
risks. The PDO and interventions were consistent with BMG’s priorities, the Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), and the GEF Operational Program #5, promoting the removal of barriers to
energy efficiency and energy conservation.

For the wastewater sector, project design incorporated expansion of wastewater collection and
treatment in Beijing, continuation of the institutional reform to improve the autonomy of BDC,
improvements in utility management, and long-term sustainability of the wastewater sector. For
air pollution reduction, the project incorporated: a manageable segment of the potential market
for boiler conversions; crucial financing to address a key constraint facing boiler houses at the
time; comprehensive grant-financed technology transfer and demonstrations necessary to support
the emerging coal-to-natural gas boiler conversion program; a novel mechanism to procure and
market natural gas boilers; and capacity enhancement for air quality monitoring and projection.

To support BMG’s “clean air program?, which focused on converting small scattered coal boilers
to cleaner fuels, the Bank selected a manageable segment of the boiler market that was relatively
stable and mature, and the project addressed about a third of the potential market for boiler
conversions. Recognizing the enormity of the challenge, the Bank included a significant degree of
technical assistance from a GEF grant to provide the necessary technological expertise. Project
design addressed the key technology void that existed in the expanding program of natural gas
utilization through: introduction of best practices in gas technology; heating energy conservation
technologies; training in coal-to-gas boiler conversion design for domestic design institutes; and
in-the-field demonstration of coal-to-gas conversions, heating systems efficiency improvements;
and energy audits.

In the absence of an established institutional model, the Bank took an innovative approach at a
time of serious need to assist Beijing, despite the challenges of launching a large commercial
operation using a new state-owned company. Even though a seasoned international consultant
was hired at the start of the project to help develop SJET management capacity and business
planning, this calculated risk did not pay off, and SJET was very slow to develop the necessary
skills and the requisite competitive mentality and management capacity. In the end, SJET’s
performance in marketing natural gas boilers had little impact on project outcomes because of the
small intervention resulting from the changed conditions.
The institutional model adopted for marketing natural gas boilers using a new and untested
company was a risky venture. However, with the scaled down boiler conversion component
(about 10% of total project cost) and BMG’s acceleration of boiler conversions in the run up to
the Olympic Games, the institutional model was not a key factor in achieving project outcomes.
The design of the key performance indicators was weak, but was amended appropriately during
project implementation.

The project design incorporated many innovative, appropriate and positive features that addressed
all the critical issues. Project design of the grant technical assistance played a catalytic role for the
emerging natural gas utilization through introduction of gas boiler technology, boiler conversion
design, heating efficiency, heating energy conservation and energy audits. Despite weaknesses in
the implementation arrangements for the boiler conversions, on balance, Bank performance in
ensuring quality at entry is rated satisfactory overall, in view of the many positive outcomes of
project design.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall, the supervision performance of the Bank was satisfactory. Supervision missions
identified and highlighted weaknesses in project management, contract management and
institutional development. The Bank was flexible in accommodating SJET requests for variations
in the boiler conversion market to spur increased sales of natural gas boilers. Despite
discouraging progress in the early years, the task team diligently pursued the implementation of
the GEF-financed technical assistance which was essential to promote gas boiler technology and
heating energy conservation, and support SJET’s activities. The Bank added further value by
agreeing to include the combined cooling, heating and power generation demonstration project in
2006. At the same time, the Bank strongly advocated improvements in detailed designs,
construction management and implementation, utility management and compliance with financial
performance covenants in the wastewater sector.

The Bank identified the need to restructure the project at the mid-term review. The task team and
Bank management responded favorably to the Borrower’s request to restructure the project when
large loan savings accumulated, and agreed to add seven new subcomponents that enhanced
achievement of the PDO and maintained the project’s relevance during a time of rapid change.
The Bank supported BMG’s choice of institutional reform for the wastewater sector that resulted
in BMG purchasing wastewater services from BDG, which changed BDC to a service provider.
The slow progress in the implementation of the GEF technical assistance diminished some of the
impact of the support for boiler conversions and gas technology development. Nevertheless,
implementation progress was rated satisfactory until 2007, when it was finally downgraded to
Moderately Satisfactory for a short time. However, the perseverance and flexibility of the task
team made it possible to use the GEF Grant to demonstrate technology for heating energy
efficiency and conservation through financing of the tri-generation cooling, heating and power
plant with grant savings using an innovative public-private partnership.
The task team leader was based in Washington until early 2008, and the task team comprised
relevant national and international experts from Beijing and Washington. Task team leadership
was transferred to a Beijing based staff thereafter. The location of several key members
(procurement, financial management, environment, and social) in Beijing throughout facilitated
frequent contacts between the Bank and the BPMO, and resolution of issues in a timely manner.
Safeguards compliance. Specialists of the task team from the Beijing office satisfactorily
supervised implementation of safeguard issues. The team carried out adequate field visits to
review progress and ensured the submission of the external monitor’s report on safeguard
implementation. Resettlement reporting was reviewed, and commented on as necessary.
Fiduciary Compliance. Oversight of financial management and procurement activities was
carried out satisfactorily by members of the task team from the Beijing office, ensuring
compliance with audit requirements and procurement procedures. Timely, and at times,
immediate responses were provided to the clients’ requests for clarification and guidance on
procurement matters.

Justification of Rating of Overall Performance

Rating: Satisfactory


                                               18
Design addressed the critical issue of poor air quality in Beijing, with an innovative project
design featuring the much needed technology transfers for efficient natural gas utilization. Project
design of the institutional model for marketing natural gas boiler fell short of expectation, but had
little impact on project outcomes. The grant technical assistance on boiler technology and
utilization, however, was highly effective to support the entire boiler conversion program of
Beijing that was implemented on an accelerated pace before the Olympic Games.

Based on the project’s overall performance, the Bank’s value addition to improving air and water
quality, satisfactory quality at entry, the high quality of supervision provided, timeliness of
project restructuring, effective communications maintained with implementing units and other
stakeholders, and achievement of the PDO and the GEO, the overall performance of the Bank is
judged satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Beijing Municipal Government’s (BMG) performance in achieving the air quality targets
before the start of the Beijing Olympic Games was an exceptional achievement. This achievement
occurred with limited project funding, but with significant and urgently needed technical
assistance provided through the GEF Grant. BMG was fully supportive of the GEF-funded
technical assistance for gas technology and heating energy conservation, and made every effort to
accelerate implementation. BMG supported the establishment of HECC which has developed into
an important resource center with a critical future role for the promotion of gas technology and
heating energy conservation. A permanent training facility has also been established to provide
continuing training.
BMG carried out a review of the institutional arrangements for the wastewater sector, and has
established the current institutional arrangements after considerable discussion, including with the
Bank. With BMG’s strong commitment and financial support, these arrangements are sustainable
in the medium-term, and assure provision of high quality service at the lowest cost to achieve the
desired environmental improvements.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Beijing Project Management Office (BPMO) provided good coordination, and performed
well in project monitoring, and in resolving difficulties as they arose. It provided strong
leadership that remained unchanged throughout the project. BPMO has consolidated its position
as a strong and permanent agency to provide support to BMG to manage foreign funding and to
coordinate implementation.
Beijing Drainage Group (BDG). Consistent with its long experience and stature as a lead
wastewater sector agency, BDG performed well in implementing the project components. All
activities, including procurement of works, goods and services, were executed in a highly
satisfactory manner. Management systems for wastewater facility management were introduced
through the GIS-based information management system.

Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB). The EPB’s capacity to monitor air quality,
analyze data and make projections was enhanced. The EPB manages a number of monitoring

                                                 19
stations covering the entire city, and developed a state-of-the-art air quality monitoring and
decision support system (AQMDSS) to enhance its monitoring and analytical capacity. EPB
provides daily reports of air quality and health advisories, as necessary.

Shihuan Jietian Energy Technology Corporation (SJET) did not possess the attributes necessary
to lead a major commercial activity. SJET staff, drawn mainly from the Beijing Gas Development
Company (which was formerly a department of BMG) was not prepared for a commercially-
oriented operation, and proactive marketing and competition. In a gradual growth scenario, which
was originally envisioned by the Bank and BGDC, SJET might have had a chance to become
better at selling gas boilers over time. But the acceleration of boiler conversions soon after the
launch of the project quickly stretched SJET’s capability. SJET’s role in the project diminished
due to the reduction in the boiler conversion component, and the transfer of the grant technical
assistance to HECC early in the project, during the mid-term review.
Heating Energy Conservation Center (HECC) assumed a greater role in the project when
implementation of the grant technical assistance was transferred from SJET. HECC implemented
all the technical assistance components satisfactorily, albeit with some delays. HECC has
developed into a repository of a wealth of information on boiler conversions, heating energy
conservation and new technology for efficient natural gas use for cooling, heating and power
generation. HECC has a major future role in natural gas use, energy auditing, heating energy
conservation and training.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Despite the weaker performance in implementing the GEF technical assistance component, the
overall performance of the Borrower is rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Wastewater Sector Institutional Reform. The Bank should adopt a flexible approach to the
institutional model for the sector, and in particular consider the country conditions, instead of
advocating the traditional utility model as the default option. The arrangements in place in
Beijing assure sustainable service provision, which rely on a combination of politically feasible
tariffs and regular confirmed resource transfers from the municipal government. However, such
an arrangement is only feasible where the city can: (i) ensure service provision at low cost; (ii)
take on responsibility for servicing debt; and (iii) provide timely cash transfers to meet shortfalls,
especially in relation to new investments.

Water Re-use. Water re-use in water scarce areas is sound policy. Beijing has performed well to
achieve a 50% rate of water reuse, by addressing the key issues relating to water re-use: (i)
reclaimed water quality and reliability; (ii) price of reclaimed water; and (iii) cost and benefit of
using water supplied through the system and reclaimed water. This should serve as an example
for other Chinese cities.
Strong Leadership Commitment. The boiler conversion program faced not only major technical,
environmental and economic issues, but also significant coordination and political issues. The
ambitious targets set for conversion to natural gas-fired boilers were only achieved (albeit mostly
outside the project) because of strong leadership, both at central and municipal government levels.
Participation of International Experts and Sharing of Knowledge. The use of international
consultants, in the case of gas boiler technology transfer and heating conservation, was highly

                                                  20
valuable and necessary in China, because use of natural gas for heating at the current scale has
started only recently. The substantial knowledge gains in efficient design and operations were
reflected in heating energy conversion, gas boiler systems, and air quality management.
Technologies developed under the project would be very useful to other cities that are
contemplating the transition from coal-fired heating to cleaner fuels.
Intervention in Commercial Operations. In areas involving significant commercial operations
(such as boiler conversions), newly established municipal entities with no commercial expertise
are not likely to succeed. It might have been more appropriate for the government to have
partnered with a truly commercial company, or the boiler conversions might have been left
entirely to market forces with some incentives to end-users.

                          Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis

                         CHINA: Second Beijing Environment Project

Economic Analysis

The development objectives of the project were to improve the ambient air quality of the Beijing
area; decrease carbon emissions to the global environment; and protect surface and ground water
quality in Beijing and downstream. There were no changes in the PDO since appraisal. Economic
benefits identified at appraisal included energy saving, land saving, environmental health
improvement and medical cost saving, groundwater saving, and agricultural benefits. These also
remained unchanged. At appraisal, the global environmental benefits were not included.
Beijing has improved air and water quality and reduced carbon and air emissions intensity since
project appraisal. For example, the ambient concentration of SO2 has been significantly lowered
from 120 µg/m3 in 1998 to 47 µg/m3 by the end of the project, i.e. 2009, while the number of days
a year with air quality worse than Class II Standard has been reduced from 265 days to 80 days.
SO2 emissions from heating boilers were reduced from 21,634 tons in 1998 to 10,800 tons in
2007. The wastewater treatment rate in the Liangshui River increased from 0% to 100% during
the same period. The overall rate of wastewater treatment in Beijing has reached 94% from 33%
at project appraisal, with 50% of treated wastewater reused.
Cost-benefit analysis was conducted at appraisal on both boiler conversion and wastewater
components. However, a comparison of projections at appraisal and at the end of the project was
not possible due to the following reasons.
(i) Due to major restructuring undertaken during project implementation (i.e., significant
reduction in the investment of the boiler conversion component and addition of a number of new
investments in river rehabilitation and wastewater treatment), the actual project composition and
impacts are significantly different from those detailed in the PAD.
(ii) It is difficult to quantitatively separate and assess the contribution of the project to the
significant economic and environmental benefits achieved in Beijing from other environmental
improvement efforts undertaken by the Beijing Municipal Government itself (for the purpose of
hosting 2008 Summer Olympic Games) during the project period.
The ICR stage analysis showed that a comparison of the EIRR for the wastewater component
would not have been possible because of a computing error. The net present value of wastewater
investments, in the PAD, was incorrectly converted, i.e., the negative (RMB -1,032 million, was
converted to positive US$ 123 million, and an EIRR of 8.7% was projected, instead of a negative
value (paragraph 22 on page 68). There was no document trail of the detailed calculations
available for review at the ICR stage.
Although the recent significant environmental improvement in Beijing may be largely attributable
to other investments driven by the government and the public sector as a result of the selection of
Beijing as the venue of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, the Bank-financed project has
contributed significantly to the remarkable achievements. The Bank project helped to improve the
wastewater collection and treatment situation, river and water environmental conditions, and
sanitation and amenity in its specific project areas through its investment in wastewater collection
and treatment and river rehabilitation along the Liangshui River, the Qing River, the Xiaotaihou
River, and the Xinfeng River. Although the amount of the project investment in boiler conversion
was scaled down, the project, together with the GEF technical assistance, provided technology
transfer, market development, and capacity building for boiler conversion, the introduction of


                                                32
energy audits, heating conservation, and the demonstration of the largest CCHP generation.
Clearly, it contributed to the air emissions reduction and air quality improvement in Beijing.
However, as indicated above, it is not possible to quantify and assess the contribution of the
project to economic and environmental improvements made in Beijing, and compare them with
estimated values at appraisal. Economic benefits at completion have been analyzed through two
case studies (one for boiler and one for river rehabilitation) to illustrate the economic
achievement quantitatively.
Boiler Conversion. Beijing successfully converted from coal to gas all the boilers (about 16,000
sets) with a capacity under 20 tons in its central urban districts by the end of 2007. The
percentage of natural gas in the total energy consumption has increased from 0.4 to 7% over the
same time frame. As a result, Beijing was able to reduce coal consumption by 6 million tons per
year and help reduce air pollution emissions and achieve the air quality improvement target of the
city. From the perspective of emission reduction per ton of coal consumed, the conversion has
proved to be successful. For example, Beijing Lishida Pharmaceutical Company upgraded its
boiler house by replacing the old ones with two new gas boilers (2t and 4t each). The project
directly saved land of 1,000 m2 and reduced SO2 and PM10 emissions by 589 kg and 846 kg per
year, respectively. While fuel costs for coal or gas are almost the same, operating cost saving and
other direct benefits are estimated at RMB 69,000 per year, excluding environmental and health
benefits, which are difficult to quantify. Economic benefits of boiler conversion are obvious. As
already noted above, the GEF TA contributed significantly to technology transfer and market
development of clean gas boilers which in turn contributed to air quality improvement of the city.
Wastewater Treatment and River Rehabilitation. This group of investments has provided the
following economic benefits: flood control, environment and health improvement, and amenity
and land value increase. For example, the river rehabilitation investment in the Ba River and the
Beixiao River in Chaoyang District significantly improved the water quality (as shown in the
table below) by intercepting and collecting three million m3 of sewerage water each year. It raised
the flood control standard from one in ten years to one in 20 to 50 years depending on river
sections, protected 270,000 local residents, and avoided potential flood damage up to RMB 50
billion. The project improved amenities along the rivers and increased land and property values.
For example, the sales price of real estate in Dongba Jiayuan (a residential neighborhood)
increased from RMB 2,800/m2 before the project to RMB 8,500/m2 after the completion of the
river rehabilitation project. Excluding the price impact of other factors, it is estimated that the
river rehabilitation contributed to an increase of property value of RMB 2,000/m2. Environmental
improvement also helped attract investment and boosted local economic development in these
areas. Since the completion of the Ba River project in 2007, the high-tech park along the river has
successfully attracted over 400 international companies (such as Motorola, Ericsson, Sony, and
Samsung), as well as domestic companies. Foreign investments totaled US$ 86 million in 2007,
with an annual increase of 79% in 2007. The project also helped preserve several historical relic
sites, enhanced the historical and cultural identity and pride of the areas and promoted the concept
of integrated river basin management.

Financial Analysis

Institutional Development. Beijing Drainage Company (BDC) was established in December
1999 during the implementation of the Beijing Environmental Project and was restructured in
April 2002 as Beijing Drainage Group Co. Ltd. (BDG). BDG currently operates 11 medium- and
large-size wastewater treatment plants with a total capacity of 2.8 million m3 per day. 95% of
wastewater generated in the downtown area of Beijing is treated by BDG. In addition to the
wastewater treatment plants, BDG also operates 70 pumping stations and about 4,000 km of
sewer networks in the urban area of Beijing. However, BDG is not an autonomous enterprise
since it has no powers to receive and manage wastewater revenues or to manage its debt service
obligations. According to the terms of restructuring, all wastewater systems (assets) have been
transferred to BDG. BMG provides funds to BDG for operation and maintenance of treatment
plants and sewer networks, based on a fee determined by the volume of wastewater treated and
BMG assumes responsibility for debt service obligations of BDG. These institutional
arrangements are different from the institutional model envisaged at project appraisal, which
required BMG to constitute BDG as an autonomous enterprise with the full autonomy to retain
and dispose of all sewerage tariffs and ownership of and responsibility for all sewerage and
drainage facilities in the Beijing urban districts.
Wastewater Tariff. To meet the cost of operating and maintaining wastewater facilities in Beijing,
BMG increased the wastewater tariff from RMB 0.30/m3 in 1999 to RMB 1.04/m3 in 2009. The
following table lists the changes in wastewater tariffs in Beijing from 1999 to 2009.

                                               34
Unlike water tariffs, the wastewater tariff in Beijing is treated as an administrative charge and is
placed under the administration of BMFB. Currently the wastewater tariff in Beijing is collected
by the Beijing Waterworks Group Co. Ltd. and then transferred to BMFB as one of its off-budget
revenues. BMFB allocates funds to BDG as a treatment fee to cover the cost of O&M of network
and wastewater treatment, based on the volume of wastewater treated. BMFB also subsidies the
difference between the treatment fee and the operating cost. However, the debt service
obligations of BDG, including loans from the World Bank, JBIC, and foreign governments, are
paid by BMFB. These financial arrangements do not comply with the financial covenant for BDG
agreed at appraisal which required BMG to cause BDG to generate revenues from wastewater and
drainage operations sufficient to cover current operational expenses and depreciation charges or
debt service payments, whichever is greater, even though the Bank agreed to BMG’s request to
delete the requirement for transferring wastewater tariff revenues to BDG.

Financial Performance. Financial statements from 2005 to 2008 were provided by BDG. The
following table summarizes the operating revenues and costs relating to wastewater treatment.

                          CHINA: Second Beijing Environment Project

1.       Resettlement Implementation

All land acquisition and resettlement in the project was related to the wastewater component. A
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was prepared by the Borrower in accordance with the national
laws, regulations and standards as well as the Bank’s policy. During implementation of the
original component and the new components added in the project restructuring, the resettlement
activities were carried out in line with the RAP.

The rehabilitation of the Qing and Liangma Rivers was part of the original components. In 2004,
seven additional rehabilitation subcomponents were included for financing using loan savings.
They consisted of further works in downstream sections of the Qing and Liangma Rivers. All
resettlement activities were fully completed by loan closure in 2009. The key indicators during
the planning and implementation stages are summarized in the table below.

2.           Comparison between Planning and Implementation

For the original components, the quantity of land acquisition for roads and land around the three
new wastewater treatment plants was increased by 34% from original estimates. However, since
the number of houses to be demolished was significantly reduced, the total resettlement cost
decreased by 20%. For the new subcomponents added following project restructuring, both land
acquisition and house demolitions were greatly reduced, but the resettlement cost did not decrease
correspondently, illustrating that resettlement has become increasingly costly and difficult. The
high cost of resettlement is due to the increase in compensation rates for land expropriated and
houses demolished. Difficulties were caused by prolonged negotiations between the project
entities and affected people. Land compensation included not only the loss of income from the
land, but also rehabilitation of the land owners, including their employment and social security.
Compensation for houses included not only the cost of the demolished houses, but also acceptable
replacement houses, the costs of which fluctuate due to the rapidly growing housing market in
Beijing.
During project implementation, the project entities continuously searched for ways to consider
how to increase the resettlement budget and reduce the scale of resettlement. To reduce the scale
of resettlement, viable alternative designs were developed in the project, such as reducing the
management area of the river course from 12 meters to 5 meters or 8 meters along both sides of

                                                      40
the rivers in Chaoyang District. Two flood detention basins were not built and instead a wetland
was opened by making use of the barren low-lying land, and an embankment was established for
flood control at the lower reaches of the Qing River.

3.       Experience and Lessons

Resettlement preparation was adequately carried out. However the resettlement difficulties were
not adequately foreseen and no analysis of resettlement risks was undertaken during the planning
stage. Resettlement implementation took longer than expected for the negotiation of
compensation rates and finding additional funds for the largely increased resettlement budget.
The civil works of an open channel at the beginning of the Liangma River were delayed due to
the slow progress of resettlement implementation. Overall, however, resettlement implementation
for all the subprojects was completed successfully within the project period.
Resettlement capacity was well developed in implementing agencies. All resettlement staff was
trained and familiar with the World Bank and the local resettlement policies. Each executing
agency had one or more staff in charge of coordinating resettlement implementation. Companies
with extensive and sound experience in resettlement implementation were contracted for physical
work at the locations. A few complaints were received relating to non-restoration of the affected
enterprises on temporarily used land, insufficient house compensation, and inadequate
participation in land compensation. These complaints were resolved satisfactorily.
BMG revised its resettlement policies and compensation rates twice in the nine years from 2000
to 2008, but barely managed to meet the fast growing needs of the affected people. Local
governments devoted more efforts to coordination and funding during resettlement
implementation. However, it was more important to work on policy issues to guide resettlement
implementation, with respect to timely updating of the compensation principles and rates, taking
the initiative in providing suitable apartments for the relocated households, as well as paying
favorable and appropriate compensation to the enterprises demolished on temporarily used land
which faced difficulties in restoration due to the modern urban planning requirements in Beijing.

4.       Internal and External Monitoring

Professors from Beijing University were entrusted with the external monitoring work. Reports
were received in a timely manner. The monitors were satisfied, with the resettlement activities
and especially, with the actions taken for livelihood restoration. Their reports were used as
models for other urban and transport projects. The internal monitoring system which was
established and improved was of significant assistance for the Bank’s supervision missions.
Major findings through external monitoring are summarized below.
     •   Resettlement implementation followed all the requirements set out in the RAPs and was
         successful;
     •   Relocation of the households improved the livelihood of the affected people. However,
         some elderly people needed more time to become accustomed to their new living
         environment, while some young people required more time to reach their work places
         from their new houses. Also, a few people who were able to lease their houses before
         relocation needed to use a portion of their compensation funds to cover their income
         losses;
     •   By project closure, production and businesses of the relocated enterprises had been
         restored, although it took about two years for some enterprises to achieve full restoration.
         It has been difficult to provide or find other jobs for those working in enterprises that

                                                 41
         were closed due to the relocation and which could not be reconstructed due to the
         updated urban planning requirements. The external monitor proposed strengthening of
         professional training or job training for those affected by the project;
     •   Even though some affected persons were not satisfied with the relocation itself, they were
         satisfied with the resettlement staff who acted in a professional and diligent manner; and
     •   The government should update resettlement policies to guide physical implementation in
         the field in a timely manner.

5.       Conclusions

The outcome of the resettlement assessment illustrated that the resettlement implementation was
successfully completed with the full participation of the affected persons whose livelihoods and
standards of living were all subsequently restored or improved. No unresolved resettlement issues
remained at project closure.

           Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

                        CHINA: Second Beijing Environment Project

I.      OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

Original Project Objective: The development objective was to improve the ambient air quality of
the Beijing area; decrease the amount of carbon emissions in the global environment; and protect
surface and ground water quality in Beijing as well as in areas downstream.
Amended Project Objective: The project development objective remained unchanged during the
implementation period.
Original Components: The original components are described in the main text of the World
Bank ICR and the PAD.

II.     PROJECT RESTRUCTURING
A number of changes were made during project implementation including the addition of new
components; changes in project management organization; changes in component numbers and
scope; the implementation period; and loan disbursement ratio. All these adjustments were
confirmed in the three amendments to the Legal Agreements.
(a)     Adjustments to Loan Components
(i) Project Restructuring and Loan Cancellations. In July 2001, during the project
implementation, Beijing won the bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. To expedite the
process of meeting air quality targets for the Games, BMG strengthened the policy support to the
coal-to-gas boiler conversion program, which in turn spurred the rapid development of Beijing’s
gas-fired boiler market by non-project vendors. At the same time, the competitive bidding
procedures introduced by the Bank had also led to loan savings in the project. Thus restructuring
of the project loan was agreed in 2006 and the Legal Agreements were amended on November 2,
2006 to include additional components for river rehabilitation, a reclaimed water plant, sludge
section in the Xiaohongmen WWTP, and O&M and GIS construction for drainage facilities.
These additional components were financed using loan savings.
Five new implementing agencies were added for the new components. These were the Beijing
Municipal Water Affairs Bureau (BMWAB); Chaoyang District Water Affairs Bureau (Chaoyang
WAB); Daxing District Water Affairs Bureau (Daxing WAB); Beijing Economic-Technological
Investment and Development Corporation; and Beijing Siqing Sanitation Engineering Group Co.,
Ltd.
The World Bank loans of US$ 26,512,600 and US$ 1,509,784 were cancelled on April 14, 2006
and November 20, 2007, respectively, and the total loan amount was reduced from the original
US$ 349,000,000 to US$ 320,977,616.
(ii) Extension of the Loan and Grant Closing Date. The loan and grant closing date was
extended from December 31, 2006 to March 31, 2009, by an amendment dated November 2,
2006. The grant closing date was finally extended to January 31, 2011 to enable completion of the
combined cooling, heating and power plant demonstration contract.
(iii) Adjustment of Disbursement Percentage. The 2006 amendment increased the disbursement
percentage for the civil works from 40% to 75%. In a second amendment on February 4, 2008,
the disbursement percentage for all remaining civil works was increased to 100%.



                                               43
(iv) Adjustment of Procurement Methods. To provide more flexibility to SJET to deal with the
boiler market changes, the World Bank agreed, in 2004, to adopt National Shopping Procedures
for boiler procurement. Additionally, International Shopping Procedures were added, and the total
allowance for Shopping was increased in the 2006 amendment.
(v) Revision of Conditions of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement with BDC. As the original
arrangement of transferring the sewerage tariff revenue to BDC was not a practical option for
Beijing’s wastewater sector reform, BMG decided to pay BDC for the services it provided to
Beijing to cover its operational costs. Since 2006, based on the actual amount of services
provided by BDC and the reviewed and agreed rate, BMG has paid BDC the operational costs.
The source of funds is mainly from sewerage tariff and supplementary government subsidies.
After these arrangements were implemented, the financial situation of BDC substantially
improved, as BDC has achieved sustainability both in institutional development and financial
balance. As a result, the second legal agreement amendments in 2008, deleted item (ii) “financial
independence to retain and use revenues from sewerage tariffs? of Article 9, Section II, Schedule
3 of the Project Agreement.
(b)     GEF Grant Financed Components Restructuring
(i) Adjustments to the Contents of the Components. Two changes to the scope of the grant of
technical assistance were made during implementation, as described below, and incorporated in
the amendments to the legal agreements in 2006:
In 2004 and 2005, the BMG and the World Bank agreed on the amended implementation plan
and adjustment of the focuses of the Gas Boiler Market and Technology Development component,
which was divided into three packages: the Technical model and capacity development of coal-to-
gas conversion; the Energy efficient gas-based technologies promotion; and the Marketing and
sales support of coal-to-gas conversion.
(ii) Revised Energy Efficient Gas-based Technologies Promotion. This is an extension of the
original activities and one focus of GEF financing after restructuring, for which 40% of the total
GEF grant was allocated. The objective of this package was to promote combined cooling,
heating and power generation (CCHP) and other efficient gas energy technologies through
technical assistance and demonstration. This would provide a highly efficient gas utilization
mode for Beijing, and facilitate the more efficient and rational use of natural gas resources.
(iii) Expanded Scope of the Energy and Environment Study. To make the outputs of the Study
more specific and to combine it with the demands of BMG’s work more closely, BMG further
expanded the scope of the component through addition of “Beijing Renewable Energy
Development Strategy Study? and “Beijing Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
Measures Study on the Basis of Sustainable Development?.
(iv) Changes to Project Implementing Agencies. There were two changes of agencies
implementing the grant of technical assistance. These were (a) the Implementation of the “Energy
and Environment Study?, which was originally planned to be implemented jointly by BEPB and
HECC, but was transferred to the Beijing Agenda 21 Office which had more experience in policy
studies and research; and (b) the transfer in 2005 of the implementation of the Gas Boiler Market
and Technology Development to HECC. With the approval of the World Bank, HECC selected a
company experienced in World Bank projects to execute the project, which was to assist HECC
in specific implementation management of part of the component.
(v) Adjustments to Procurement Methods. Quality-based selection (QBS) and selection based on
consultant’s qualifications (LCS) procedures were added for GEF components to meet the
implementation requirements of the project.



                                                44
(vi) Extension of the GEF Grant Closing Date. At the end of 2008, the World Bank officially
approved the extension of the Grant closing date to January 31, 2010, to complete construction,
monitoring and evaluation of the CCHP demonstration project to fully achieve the project
objectives. A further extension of the GEF Grant closing date, to January 31, 2011, was agreed to
utilize the Grant savings (of US$ 2.77 million) to prepare a project based on low-carbon economy,
for financing by the World Bank, which is not part of this ICR.

III.    PROJECT OUTPUTS

(ii) Wastewater Interception consisting of 10,293 meters of interceptor sewers.
(iii) Environmental water resource consisting of a water pump station and pipelines.
(iv) Ecological landscaping consisting of landscaping along 10.35 km of riverbanks.
(v) Flow diversion consisting of wastewater from the upper reaches of the Xinfeng River being
diverted to municipal sewers, and eventually to the WWTP.
(vi) Sluice gate and traffic bridge consisting of reconstructed sluice gate and traffic bridge at
Suncun.
(vii) Technical Assistance Outputs: Investigation and studies of the status and problems of the
river and lake system and water conservation facilities in Daxing District, the current situation of


                                                 47
the Xinfeng River, and monitoring data of water quality of the Xinfeng River. The consultant
completed the following reports: Final Report of the Water System Master Plan of Daxing
District; the Engineering Plan of the Feng River Rehabilitation; and the Final Report of the Study
on the Environmental Impacts of Water Reuse Project of the Xinfeng River.
(d)     The BDA Reclaimed Water Plant
The plant was put into operation in July 2008. The treated effluent water quality meets the
designed effluent quality, and is acceptable to enterprises in BDA. The output is a water re-use
plant with capacity of 20,000 m3/d and has a distribution network of 13 km.
(e)     Reconstruction of the Datun Solid Waste Transfer Station
Output of the component is a modern transfer station capable of handling up to 2,400 tons/d of
solid waste. Waste is compacted and transferred to the landfill using 40 new compactor vehicles
each with a capacity of 20 tons.

IV.     PROJECT OUTCOMES
The second BEP improved the air quality of Beijing and the water environment of the Liangshui
River, the Wenyu River and the Qing River basins. The project accomplished all the targeted
objectives and achieved remarkable overall outcomes. It also played an active role in Beijing’s
fulfillment of its commitments of “Green Olympics? in 2008.

(a)     Outcomes of the Wastewater Management and River Rehabilitation Components
The project boosted further development of Beijing’s drainage system and made important
contributions to reduce pollution discharges and increase Beijing’s wastewater treatment capacity.
The treatment ratio increased from 25% in 1999 to 93% in 2008, with the total wastewater
treatment capacity increasing from 1.08 million m3/day to 2.52 million m3/day, including the
capacity of 780,000 m3/day of three WWTPs funded by the Bank loan under this project.
The rehabilitation of the North Moat and the lower reaches of the Qing, Liangshui, Ba, Beixiao,
Xiaotaihou and Xingfeng rivers, along with enhanced flood control and drainage capacity of the
rivers, improved the river water quality, served as a demonstration for the overall river
environment improvement in Beijing, and provided water environment and water security
assurance for the Beijing Olympic Games as well as contributing to economic and social
development.
The Beijing Drainage Operations Management System and GIS for sewer network provided BDG
with a state-of-the-art, efficient tool to manage the large drainage network and facilities in Beijing.
The upgraded solid waste transfer station improved the efficiency of solid waste management in
Beijing. The new waste transfer vehicles solved the secondary pollution problems and completely
eliminated surface and groundwater pollution and leachate spills at the transfer station.
The reclaimed water plant conserved water resources, reduced wastewater discharge, and
generated energy savings.

(b)     Outcomes in Air Pollution Reduction Component
Beijing’s air quality has been significantly improved and the coal firing related pollutants have
been reduced enormously. This has improved the living environment of the citizens and protected
their health. Compared to 1998, the 2006 yearly average concentrations of sulfur dioxide and
carbon monoxide have both declined, by 55% and 36%, respectively. Coal consumption is
estimated to have been reduced by 6 million tons/year, greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions


                                                 48
have also been reduced, and there has been a corresponding significant improvement in air
quality.
The component became the driving force for the coal-to-gas conversion program, which was in
its infancy in Beijing. The project helped to improve awareness and promote policies, develop the
gas boiler market, introduce and promote efficient gas boilers, reduce boiler prices, and introduce
coal-to-gas conversion technology and improve service standards. The component prepared the
foundations for the acceleration of the implementation of the clean fuel program that occurred in
later years, spurred by the impending Olympic Games—a program that was essential for the air
quality improvement of Beijing.
The capacity of BMG for air quality management, including monitoring, analysis and prediction,
was enhanced through the increased number of updated monitoring stations, and the development
of the state-of-the-art Air Quality Monitoring and Decision Support System (AQMDSS).
The project has greatly raised the awareness of the relevant departments of BMG to alleviate air
pollution, leading to the 11th Five-Year Energy Plan attaching increased importance to clean
energy utilization, as well as providing important support for BMG’s issuing of the Regulation
for Renewable Energy Utilization Management.

V.      ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS

(a)     Environmental Benefits
With the operation of the three WWTPs, the environment of the Liangshui River basin as well as
the southern part of Beijing city has been improved significantly. Wastewater interception has
significantly reduced the source of pollution to the river, decreased the discharge of wastewater to
natural water bodies and to the groundwater in neighboring areas, and greatly abated the organic
pollutant load in the water environment. As a result, the water environment and landscapes,
especially the surface water environment, have been improved. Pollution in the river has been
dramatically reduced, aquatic life has gradually recovered, and the river has again become a
habitat of wild birds. Through rehabilitation projects of the eight main river sections in urban
districts of Beijing (including the lower reaches of the Liangshui River, lower reaches of the Qing
River, North Moat and the Liangma River, the Ba River, the Beixiao River, the Xiaotaihou River,
the canal connecting the Honglingjin Lake and the Shuizhui Lake, and the Xinfeng River), the
water quality and the regional water environment of the rivers have improved overall,
landscaping on the river banks and in surrounding areas have been provided, and the river
ecosystems have been effectively restored and improved. The implementation of the coal-to-gas
boiler conversion component in turn accelerated the conversion of coal-fired boiler to gas-fired
boiler—contributing significantly to cleaner air in Beijing. The newly constructed Datun Solid
Waste Transfer Station has not only expanded its waste treatment and transfer capacity, but also
updated its technology and management by adopting a closed transfer workshop, along with
advanced dust and odor control systems and wastewater collecting and treatment facilities, which
have eliminated the problems encountered by the affected communities of secondary pollution
that previously emanated from the old station caused by leachate, dust, odor and white pollution
to the streets.

(b)     Social benefits
The dredging and widening of the eight river channels in the city area of Beijing have greatly
relieved the pressure of flood control in Beijing.
The completion of the wastewater management and river rehabilitation projects has improved the
living environment of the catchment areas, and serves as relaxing and peaceful recreational areas

                                                49
for people living in the city.
Seven million tons of reclaimed water will be produced and supplied to the enterprises and
residents of BDA thus reducing the total water supply of BDA by 40% annually. This component
has assisted the BDA to achieve the objective of saving energy, reducing emission and
developing a recycling economy.
The wastewater treatment project has played an important role in enhancing water re-use,
increasing irrigation efficiency, conserving ground water resources, preventing ground water
overexploitation and improving the ecological environment in neighboring areas.
According to available partial statistics, the operation of the three WWTPs and the Reclaimed
Water Plant has created up to 284 jobs.
The project outputs have become platforms of environment protection education for the local
citizens. Activities such as community education, interaction with the residents and the selection
of supervision volunteers have greatly raised the public awareness of water conservation and
resources protection.
The ICB procurement activities under the World Bank project have not only facilitated operation
and management experience exchange and technological optimization in the gas boiler market of
Beijing, but have also promoted price stabilization and the healthy development of the gas boiler
market, and citizens have displayed a greater willingness to use clean energy.
The construction and upgrading of the ten air quality monitoring stations has effectively
improved Beijing’s management capacity of air quality monitoring. The environment monitoring
data are released to the public via Beijing Television Station in a timely manner—a development
viewed favorably by the local citizens.
The AQMDSS developed and established under the project has enhanced BMG’s capacity for air
quality projection and assessment and has provided crucial technical assistance to enhance the
government’s capability of strategic decision-making on air pollution control measures. As part
of the data integration system of air quality forecast, the AQMDSS played an important role in air
quality forecasting during the Olympic Games in 2008. The system is operated efficiently by
BEPB’s computing cluster, and provides a daily service of air quality forecast to the public.

(c)     Economic benefits

With smooth implementation and completion of the project, the social and the environmental
benefits have been emerging gradually, resulting in the following indirect regional economic
benefits:
(i) The improvement of the basin area environment of the eight rivers resulting from the
rehabilitation works and wastewater management under the project has promoted economic
development in these areas. This has attracted more investment, both domestic and foreign, and
has especially spurred the development of the real estate industry. The environmental
improvement of the project has stimulated regional economic growth, increased local
governments’ revenues, and brought significant indirect economic benefits to local people and
organizations.
(ii) The river rehabilitation projects have provided clean water for agricultural irrigation, which
has reduced groundwater exploitation and the waste of clean water resources, leading to an
indirect increase in farmers’ incomes. For example, the Liangfeng irrigation channel with a total
length of 1.91 km has been built to carry treated water to the Nanhongmen agricultural irrigation
area in Daxing District, while about 300,000 m3 of secondary effluent from the Xiaohongmen
WWTP (annually 100,000,000 m3) can be delivered to the area for agricultural irrigation of

                                                50
13,333 ha (200,000 mu). The actual water delivered was about 5,200,000 m3 in 2008, which
means irrigation costs of RMB 54,600,000 [RMB 1.1/m3–RMB 0.05/ m3)×52,000,000 m3, RMB
1.10/m3 for ground water and RMB0.05/ m3 for secondary effluent]. The channel can also reduce
the exploitation of ground water by 60,000,000 m3 annually, which yields enormous economic
benefits.
(iii) The Xiaohongmen Sludge Digestion System can save electricity energy of 27,000 kwh/day,
equivalent to RMB 6,696,500/year [RMB 0.6795/kwh (the electric power price for industrial
use)×27,000 kwh/day×365 days]. The system can also save 2,000 m3 of gas each day, and
conserve 300,000 m3 of gas in each heating season, which will save about RMB 1,534,000 each
year. The calculation is as follows: RMB 1.95/m3×[2,000 m3×365 days×(12?4)/12 + 300,000
m3]. RMB 1.95/m3 is the current gas price for industrial use, and a four-month heating season is
considered. In total, the Xiaohongmen WWTP can directly save energy costs of approximately
RMB 8,230,500 per year.

VI.     MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND
        OUTCOMES

(a)     Factors outside the Control of Government or Implementing Agencies

(i) Boiler procurement was adversely affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003, and
 implementation was delayed by about six months.
(ii) The depreciation of the U.S. dollar imposed difficulties due the increased counterpart funding
requirements.
(iii) The global financial crisis caused a sharp drop in the demands for the re-use water from the
BDA Reclaimed Water Plant.
(iv) The selection of Beijing as the venue for the 2008 Olympic Games had a major impact on the
implementation of the boiler conversion component. To achieve acceptable air quality during the
Games, BMG issued a series of preferential policies, designed to accelerate the overall boiler
conversion program, which resulted in the scaling down of the boiler conversion component of
the project.
(v) In 2004 and 2005, Beijing temporarily experienced a shortage of natural gas which affected
the gas boiler sales, and the boiler conversion component was forced to slow down.

(b)     Factors under the Control of the Government

There were both positive and negative impacts of historical events to this project. These included:
(i) Fluctuation of prices and supplies affected project implementation costs as various supporting
policies issued by the government facilitated the progress of resettlement under the project and
thus expedited the construction works in general, while some of the civil works had to be
suspended due to some special requirements of the government.
(ii) The dramatic surge in real estate development of Beijing since 2005 caused a significant
increase in the compensation rates for resettlement. The lack of a revised policy for compensation
standards of resettlement in the downtown area created difficulties for project implementation.
(iii) Some of the related public facilities were not constructed according to plan. This meant that
the pollution control effects of the project were affected. For example the Dongba and Fatou
WWTPs were not constructed, and as a result the planned improvement in water quality in the Ba
River and Xiaotaihou River under the project was not fully realized.

                                                51
(iv) During the project implementation period (2001–2008) Beijing experienced rapid economic
growth, making it difficult to accurately estimate project costs at appraisal, which led to
adjustments to the overall cost estimation of the project and the need for amendments to the
project. As the rapid growth of the clean energy and gas boiler market could not be projected, the
appraisal cost estimates for gas boilers were significantly over estimated. Additionally, the target
to finance 2,000 gas boiler was overly optimistic and varied markedly from the actual
achievement (591 sets), which resulted in a large amount of loan savings.
(c)     Factors under the Control of Implementing Agencies

(i) The additional river rehabilitation works were implemented under a very tight schedule that
required bidding before designs were fully completed, resulting in a number of contract variations.
(ii) Removal or relocation of municipal infrastructure facilities, and coordination with
agencies responsible for traffic and power caused delays in construction.
(iii) There were difficulties in implementation because new agencies included in the additional
works lacked experience in World Bank procedures and also lacked adequate project
management experience.

VII.    SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROJECT

The Second Beijing Environment Project is sustainable, according to the evaluations of this
project, in the following three aspects:
(i) There are adequately experienced staff and organizational arrangements;
(ii) Management systems and sufficient capacity exist for operation and maintenance of the
constructed facilities.
(iii) Adequate financial resources and commitment are available.
In addition, the operation costs of the sewerage network, pumping stations and WWTPs are
covered by the sewerage tariff and government subsidies. The rate of the wastewater treatment
fee agreed by the BDG, BMWAB and BMFB is RMB 0.743 m3 and the rate for sewerage
network is RMB 98.34 per meter. This mechanism ensures that BDG’s fund demands for
business operation and equipment maintenance can be satisfied. The funds for repayment of the
World Bank loan are appropriated by the BFB. Thus, the financial sustainability of this
component is satisfactory.
Beijing Economic & Technological Investment Development Corporation (BETIDC) is
responsible for the operation and maintenance costs of the BDA Reclaimed Water Plant, and the
World Bank loan repayment is guaranteed by the BDA Finance Bureau. The global financial
crisis has caused the market to shrink and subsequently adversely affected the source water
quality. As a result it is predicted that the Plant will be in deficit from 2009 to 2011. BETIDC and
the Boda Water Affair Co. Ltd. are actively taking measures to achieve normal operating as soon
as possible.

VIII.   PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK AND THE BORROWER

(a)     The Bank’s Performance. The Bank’s performance was rated satisfactory for the
following reasons:
(i) The project was well prepared and addressed two key environmental issues of Beijing: water
pollution and air pollution. The outputs of the project have met the urgent needs of Beijing to


                                                 52
improve the air and water quality. The Second Beijing Environment Project component package
has expedited the recent improvement of Beijing’s environment.
(ii) The World Bank has been flexible, pragmatic and cooperative, giving patient guidance and
effective assistance to the Borrower throughout the project cycle, and has provided policy
assurance for smooth project implementation.
(iii) During project appraisal, the World Bank fully respected BMG’s actual needs, assisted in
establishing project objectives, and in making implementation plans. In addition the Project
Appraisal Document was completed promptly.
(iv) During project implementation, the World Bank provided timely and adequate guidance and
assistance in procurement and implementation. With regard to issues that arose during project
implementation, the World Bank task team conducted deep and detailed investigations in a timely
manner and actively sought practical solutions and measures, so as to resolve the issues smoothly.
(v) In the later stage of project implementation, the World Bank further enhanced the
management by local experts in the project task team and granted more authority to the Beijing
office. Following the appointment of a staff member from the World Bank Beijing Office as task
team leader, the efficiency of communication and project management improved due to her
understanding of China’s situation and government policies.
(vi) The World Bank is highly attentive to the integrated outcomes and benefits of the project.
For example, the World Bank loan supported not only the construction of WWTPs, but also the
development and construction of associated facilities such as sewerage networks, sludge disposal
systems, river rehabilitation and wastewater reuse facilities, and the Bank also emphasized and
suggested reforms and innovation of related management institutions. This has advanced the
integrated economic benefits of water environment improvement project and realized the
maximum environmental and social benefits of the project.
(vii) The World Bank projects focus on not only the investment in hardware, but also the
enhancement and improvement of technical, financial and management capacities of the project
implementing agencies and the optimization of the sector system design. Under this project the
World Bank loan has been utilized to procure a significant amount of advanced equipment and
facilities. Meanwhile, the technical and management capacities of all the implementing agencies
and the whole project team have been strengthened through technical assistance, training and
management consulting services.

Suggestions. The following suggestions could be considered for improvements to future projects:

(i) The World Bank projects could combine the overall design and management mode with
specific local situations and needs.
(ii) The World Bank headquarters could grant more authority to country offices and provide more
favorable conditions for project implementation. The Bank should confer more power to the
implementing agencies when they have the adequate capacity of project management and
implementation. This could lead to the achievement of improved project management results and
effects in procurement and disbursement. For example, changes could be made in terms of the
disbursement ratio for the category “Civil Works,? the thresholds for the procurement methods
“ICB? and “NCB? and prior-review and post-review.
(iii) It is also hoped that the Bank’s team be maintained in a more stable and consistent form.
This project had a succession of three task team leaders, and the composition of team members
also changed several times. This affected the project progress in certain stages to some extent.


                                                53
(b)     Performance of the Borrower

The Borrower’s performance was in general satisfactory. A project management team with good
management qualities that are adequate to the management requirements has been assembled.
Led by the BPMO, the implementation agencies worked rigorously and pragmatically and
developed a set of rules and regulations adapted to the project management requirements.
Successful completion of the project mainly depended on the following factors:
(i) In the initial stage of the project, BMG set up a leading group specifically for this project,
headed by the relevant mayors. Under this group was a project management office (BPMO) with
proper staffing and ensured financial support. Based on stable organization and staff with a
strong sense of responsibility, the BPMO has established a set of rules and institutions suitable for
professional management of World Bank projects.
(ii) According to the needs of the components, the implementation agencies set up different
departments such as the project operation department, the procurement management department,
the construction engineering department, the resettlement department, financial department, the
archives department, etc. The departments of most implementing agencies have properly
designed positions and professional and stable teams, which allowed communication with the
BPMO and the World Bank to be conducted in a timely and effective way and ensured smooth
project implementation.
(iii) The counterpart funds were appropriated in time. The World Bank fully understood and
supported the project restructuring as well as some contract variations, all of which contributed to
the final completion of the project.
(iv) Through bidding procedures the implementation agencies selected and hired qualified
professional design institutes and supervision companies to be responsible for engineering design
and construction supervision. This ensured high quality technical services for the project.
(v) Foreign and domestic experts provided effective technical assistance and consulting services
through international consultancy projects.
(vi) BPMO organized many project management training sessions regarding bidding and
procurement, disbursement, contract management and other subjects to improve the professional
capabilities of all the PMO staff, to enable them to solve problems in a timely fashion. This has
provided a comprehensive operational basis to ensure smooth project implementation.
(vii) The engineering documents and materials have been collected and filed in time with the
progression of the project and they reflect the actual construction situations and project progress.
Each stage and section of the construction has undergone appropriate examination and checking
procedures.

Issues of concern

(i) Due to the fact that the time for the project preparation was limited, especially for the loan
saving components, many projects used preliminary design drawings in the bidding. This caused
some of the bidding documents to be not specific or sufficiently complete, and in some cases
items were missing or were of unreasonable design. This led to many contract variations and
noticeable changes in the contract amounts during project implementation. This occurred to the
civil works contracts such as the Qing River, the Ba River and the Xiaotaihou River.
(ii) During project preparation, the resettlement risks analysis was not adequate and the
difficulties in land acquisition were underestimated. This resulted in a delay of about one year of
the completion of the civil works of the 435 meter section in the Liangma River.

                                                 54
IX.     EXPERIENCES, LESSONS LEARNED AND SUGGESTIONS

The Second Beijing Environment Project, which was implemented over 10 years, made important
contributions to the water and air pollution abatement and prevention in Beijing, as well as
institutional reform and enhancement of knowledge and skill. The Beijing PMO and the PIUs has
gained valuable experiences and learned lessons as discussed below:
(i) Set-up project management office with all staff trained for the project preparation and
implementation.
(ii) Avoid underestimating project risks. China is a developing country and its capital city,
Beijing has been experiencing tremendously rapid development. The scaling-down of the boiler
conversion component was to a large extent the result of external changes outside the project.
The Second Beijing Environment Project commenced at a time when Beijing’s economy and
society was developing very rapidly with various systems and mechanisms being reformed. The
project appraisal underestimated the speed of development of the clean energy promotion and gas
boiler market in Beijing and also overestimated the potential market for SJET. This illustrates
that when a large-scale project with a long time-span is to be carried out in a fast growing city
like Beijing, risks caused by potential changes in policy, market, technology and society must be
fully anticipated, and only with flexible implementation modes in project organization,
procurement management and other aspects, which can rapidly be adapted to external changes,
can damages or loss be mitigated.
In the initial stage of project implementation, due to very limited experience of the implementing
agency in World Bank loan project management, there was a noticeable deficiency in overall
progress planning and risk assessment. For example, risk analysis was inadequate for the land
acquisition and resettlement at the 435 meter section of the Liangma River, causing the civil
works to fall behind schedule. As a result, the actual implementation period was one year longer
than originally planned.
Due to insufficient analysis on related conditions and project risks during the initial stage of the
project, both the quality and quantity of the source water for the BDA Reclaimed Water Plant are
problematic. This has affected the achievement of expected project outcomes. Although the
implementing agency is remedying the situation, the project costs have been increased.
In addition, the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates over the course of the long
project implementation period have also been underestimated.
(iii) Adequate solutions to complaint issues should be implemented as early as possible. It is
unavoidable that complaints will occur during project implementation due to various reasons, but
they must be addressed as early as possible. For example, a complaint was received during the
bidding process of vehicle procurement under the component of the Datun Solid Waste Transfer
Station reconstruction and the implementing agency, lacking the necessary experience, did not
respond in an adequate or timely manner. Consequently, the vehicle procurement was prolonged
and the component completion was delayed to some extent.
(iv) Ensuring that local counterpart funds are made available in time. For certain components,
management levels and the procedures of local counterpart funds were so complicated that the
funds failed to be in place promptly, which to some degree affected the smooth progress of the
project.

Suggestions


                                                 55
(i) More prudent design of market-oriented approaches.

During the project design of the Second Beijing Environment Project, it was recommended that
both the components of boiler conversion and wastewater management were to be aimed at fully
market-oriented modes of sector management. However, over the last eight years, it is evident
that the good progress of boiler coal-to-gas conversion in Beijing can be mainly attributed to the
assistance of the government. Therefore, the implementation arrangements of the boiler
conversion component have vacillated between administrative and market-oriented approaches.
The inherent inner contradiction in the institutional setting-up of SJET has become increasingly
apparent. Inevitably, many specific problems occurred in aspects of coordination between the
government and the Beijing Gas Group, and SJET’s operation and project implementation, which
has hindered the smooth progress of the component. Meanwhile, although the reform of
Beijing’s drainage sector has made significant progress, the current BDG operation mode differs
from how it was originally conceived, and the facts have proved that this mode is effective and
suitable for the specific situation of Beijing.
This shows that environment protection projects for development of public utilities are essentially
inherently for the public interest, and the characteristics unique to China have determined that the
development approaches in all sectors would inevitably differ from those in western countries.
Therefore, for future World Bank designs projects in different countries, it is likely to be
beneficial to ascertain the optimal arrangements for project implementation, how to fit the
specific local conditions and what kind of market-oriented approach should be selected.
(ii) More authority and flexibility granted to the implementing agencies.

As the Chinese economy is developing rapidly, it is difficult to make at the time of project
appraisal an accurate estimate of project costs. Therefore, it is likely that the overall project
budget will require noticeable adjustments, often undertaken through complicated procedures.
Furthermore, some important historical events (such as the Beijing Olympic Games) are likely to
influence market prices and supplies, and this will in turn have a direct impact on the costs of
project implementation.
As a result it is suggested that (a) implementing agencies be granted more authority and
flexibility to deal with necessary adjustments during project restructuring, and (b) the period for
price adjustment (180 days) in Special Conditional of Contract (SCC) should be shortened
moderately.
(iii) More communication and coordination between the World Bank and local government
regulators of bidding and procurement.
In order to ensure a smooth bidding process (especially the ICB), it is necessary for the World
Bank to further coordinate with the Ministry of Commerce and other related agencies to make the
World Bank’s “Procurement Guidelines? more practical in China and reduce difficulties for the
implementation agencies.
(iv) More effective measures needed for handling complaints from unsuccessful bidders

More pro-active and effective measures would be of assistance in solving issues of complaints
from unsuccessful ICB bidders. Otherwise, should a complainer intend to cause delay, the
current process may lead to tremendous risks of bidding failure and result in severe delay of
project progress. It may be beneficial if the World Bank set up or coordinated with concerned
domestic agencies to co-establish an arbitration agency for complaint issues.
(v) International consulting companies expected to promote localization.


                                                 56
The World Bank attaches great importance to contributions made by international consulting
companies in providing technical assistance. However, due to differences in culture and
management styles between countries, problems sometimes occur when the international
company’s working mode is not compatible with the client’s requirements or in cases where the
outputs are not as satisfactory as expected. In such cases the World Bank could encourage
international consultants enhance localization to better meet the clients’ demands.
(vi) More local employees in the World Bank teams.
The experiences with the Second Beijing Environment Project have shown that it is very
important to have excellent local experts in the World Bank project teams to improve project
management efficiency, in particular for solving complex problems. To further enhance the
World Bank management it may be useful to consider using more local staff to achieve more
effective communication and higher efficiency in project management.
(vii) More authority granted to the World Bank Office in Beijing (WBOB).

The project progress of the Second Beijing Environment Project has been more efficient since
