MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER
FOR A NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT
1.        The following report and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Niger for SDR 15.0 million (US$19.9 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance the first
five-year phase of a long-term support program to strengthen national
agricultural research, to make agricultural research more responsive to
producers' needs, and to assist with the restoration and conservation of soil
fertility. Parallel financing in the amount of US$ 4.6 million equivalent
would be provided by bilateral donors.
2.        Backg-ound.       The  rural  sector  is  the principal  source  of
livelihood for about 80Z of the population and accounts for about 45Z of
Niger's GNP. Although the country has been traditionally self-sufficient in
food production (except during severe droughts), increased production to keep
up with population growth has taken place by shortening fallow periods and
cultivating more marginal lands, as well as by overexploiting the plant cover
for livestock and fuelwood production. This leads to a decline of soil
fertility and soil degradation. Past attempts to introduce improved technical
packages for rainfed agriculture (chemical fertilizers, single cropping,
aiiimal traction) have not been successful, partly because they do not seem
to respond adequately to farmers' constraints and priorities.
3.        Agricultural Research.   The performance of agricultural research
in Niger has been disappointing up to now. The need to evaluate the current
system and to redefine research priorities was recognized during the
preparation of structural adjustment lending in Niger in 1985-1986. With
external assis.ance from ISNAR, the Government undertook a thorough study in
two phases of the current agricultural research system in order to propose
a long-term plan. Phase 1 was prepared by an ISNAR team in February, 1987.
Phase 2 was prepared by six national working groups assisted by ISNAR. With
assistance from FAO/CP, this study has led to an operational first five-year
tranche of a long-term research plan.
4.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project would represent the first
five-year phase of the long-term development plan for agricultural research.
Its basic objectives are to strengthen the national capacity for agricultural
research planning and implementation by: (i) improving priority-setting and
resource allocation methodology, taking into account farmers' needs and
resource conservation; (ii) improving coordination in the formulation and
execution of national and international agricultural research programs; (iii)
improving research programming, budgeting and financial management, as well
as monitoring and evaluation of research programs; (iv) improving staff
planning, training, recruitment and career development in research; (iv)
strengthening linkages between research, extension services and farmers with
on-farm adaptive research and participatory research programs. In addition
it would improve environmental protection and soil fertility through closer



integration of research on crops, livestock and agro-forestry and will
develop optimum farming systems for each agro-ecological zone.
5.        Bank Role and Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA is helping the
Government to reorient its agricultural policy as part of its overall
structural adjustment program. The past failures of zainfed projects
highlight the importance of having effective agricultural research systems
which are responsive to farmers' needs and take into account their
constraints within their own farming systems. The proposed project is part
of IDA's effort to improve agricultural research services and complements an
agricultural extension services pilot program which is being implemented in
the framework of the Small Rural Operations Project (Credit 1890 NIG).
6.        Project Description.    In the first tranche  of the  long-term
research plan, the proposed project would seek to achieve the above
objectives by financing:   (i) improvements to INRAN's basic network of
research centers; (ii) short-term and long-term technical assistance and
staff training needed to strengthen the local technical and administrative
capacity to plan, implement, monit.or and evaluate the national research
program; (iii) equipment, vehicles and supplies, and operating and
maintenance costs associated with the implementation of the priority recearch
programs; (iv) equipment and operating costs needed by research staff for the
periodic training of extension staff and for the off-station adaptive
research program.
These components would be accompanied by the following reforms: (i)
change in the statute of INRAN defining its relationship with the Goverreent
and making adequate provisions for personnel recruitment, training and career
development; (ii) reorganization of INRAN, redefining technical and financial
responsibilities for multidisciplinary programs, research stations and
research departments as well as reorganization of the Management Council,
Technical Committee and Financial Committee (including representatives from
relevant ministries, extension services, and the farmer community).
7.        The total cost of the five-year project is estimated at US$28.0
million equivalent, of which US$17.08 (61Z) is in foreign exchange. A
breakdown of costs and the tentative financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
The amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as the
disbursement schedule, are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Niger are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing project coverage and
location of research centers and research stations is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 8007-NIR dated February 23, 1990 is also attached.
Two Project Preparation Facilities (PPF) were made available: one to
undertake the preparation of the long-term plan and the other to assist INRAN
to prepare for project implementation.
8.        Actions agreed upon.  Assurances were obtained from Government on
the following: (a) Government budget allocation for INRAN to finance the
salaries of new INRAN staff, all incremental overhead operating costs, and
on an increasing basis, the operating costs of new research programs; (b)
revision of INRAN statutes and reorganization of INRAN; (c) INRAN would
prepare new procedures for research programming, a Manpower Development Plan,
and a livestock production research program; (d) Government would create a
Donor Consultative Group 'or agricultural research programming and financing,



- 3 -
with operational regulations acceptable to IDA, in which all donors funding
agricultural research in Niger would be invited to participate; and (e) a
mid-term review would be carried out. Conditions of effectiveness would be:
(a) approval and adoption of the revised statutes of INRAN; (b) establishment
of the National Committee on Research Programs and of the Regional
Research/Development Councils; (c) Financing Agreement duly executed on
behalf of the Government and INRAN. Conditions of disbursement each year
would be the approval by IDA of a detailed work plan, budget and financing
plan for the next fiscal year.
9.        Benefits.  The productivity of the agricultural subsector is below
its  potential.     Although  difficult  to  quantify,  the  deteriorating
environmental conditions in Niger constitute a serious economic loss. The
development of adequate and sustainable technologies by an efficient
agricultural research system linked with extension would help to increase
and stabilize agricultural production, enhance household incomes, avoid a
further decline in soil fertility, and combat rural poverty.
10.       Risks.  The greatest risk faced by the project is the potential
difficulty in developing feasible economic solutions to the degradation of
the environment and suitable technical recommendations for increased crop and
livestock productivity in the context of the particularly difficult
agricultural situation in Niger. However, the non-project risk in the decline
of fertility, soil degradation and over-exploitation is considerable and
research is essential to combat this. Potential risks also reside in the:
(a) relevance of priority research programs taking into accoun. fa rmers
needs and resource conservation; (b) adequacy of the linkages between
research and extension; (c) adequate funding for the development of a long-
term national research program; and (d) possible lack of qualified staff by
non-adherence to recruitment and human resource development criteria. To
reduce these risks, the project would include specific measures backed up by
conditionality, in particular with respect to: government financial
participation, donor coordination, training and short-term and long-term
technical assistance, establishment of technical and financial committees
with the participation of representatives of extension services and farming
community.
11.       Recommendation.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
