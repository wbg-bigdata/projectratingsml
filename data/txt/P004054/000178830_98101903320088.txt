FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the Korean National Railroad
(KNR), with the objective of enabling it to fulfill its economic role and
satisfy the long-term requirements of increased traffic brought about by
the growth of the economy. The proposed loan of US$40 million equivalent
would be the fourth Bank Group lending for KNR; the first was in 1962
(Credit 25-KO) and amounted to US$14 million equivalent. IDA Credit 110-KO
(US$11 million) and IDA Credit 183-KO/Loan 669-KO (US$55 million) supported
XNR's Investment Plan during the second Five-Year Plan period (1967-1971).
These aided in the establishment of KNR as a semi-autonomous agency within
the Government and the expansion of rail capacity to cope with the sharply
rising transport needs accompanying the rapid growth of the economy.
ii.       The very rapid expansion in income, production and international
trade of Korea in recent years has placed severe pressure on the transport
system. Government investment in transport increased significantly in the
second Five-Year Plan period (1967-1971). However, transport capacity
still needs to be augmented to meet the present and anticipated future de-
mands. In addition to the assistance for the railway mentioned above, the
Bank Group made a credit of US$3.5 million (S4-KO) in 1968 for highway
studies and a study of transport organization and coordination, which was
later incorporated into a loan of US$54.5 million (Loan 769-KO) in 1971 for
a highway project. The Bank is the Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed
ports study currently under way.
iii.      The evolution to a multi-mode transport system has diminished the
dominant role of KNR. However, KNR will continue to perform an important
economic role, particularly as a carrier of bulk commodities and production
in addition to significant passenger traffic. With the growth of the econ-
omy, industrialization and urbanization, the capital, Seoul City (with a
present population of over 5.5 million), is in urgent need of a mass rapid
transit system to relieve the traffic problems of the metropolitan area.
KNR will play an important role in alleviating this transport problem and
plans to electrify railway services in the Seoul suburban area to provide
the requisite services and aid in decentralization of the population.
iv.       The project, costing an estimated US$265 million equivalent, con-
sists of the first three years of KNR's US$339.5 million 1972-1976 Investment
Plan. The main items of the project constitute electrification of KNR lines
in the Seoul suburban area and provision of electric railcars (23%); comple-
tion of the already started electrification (including acquisition of elec-
tric locomotives) of 350 km of KNR lines connecting Seoul with the north-
eastern part of Korea where coal and cement industries are located (22%);
track and bridge renewals and strengthening (10%); provision of yard facili-
ties and some capacity increases in stations (13%); acquisition of freight
cars and passenger cars (16%); and improvement of facilities for maintenance
and repair of motive power and rolling stock (3%). The balance consists of



- ii -
miscellaneous items (13%). The proposed loan would finance specific goods,
mostly imported, procured through international competitive bidding: track
materials, bridge girders, track equipment, 271 passenger coaches, 5 break-
down cranes, and plant and machinery for workshops and sheds. Should Korean
firms win contracts for constructing ordinary passenger cars and supplying
bridge girders, disbursements from the proposed loan would be made against
the total costs of these, including the local cost component. Such local
cost financing is not expected to exceed US$8 million equivalent. The total
foreign exchange component of the project amounts to an estimated US$156.5
million equivalent. This is to be financed by the proposed loan of US$40
million, a special Yen credit allocation of about US$35 million equivalent
for the Seoul suburban electrification scheme, US$15 million from Credit
183-KO/ Loan 669-K0, about US$54 million equivalent from bilateral sources
and the balance from Government, mainly for contingencies on financing from
non-bank sources. Most of the local costs would be provided by Government,
since KNR's financial situation does not enable it to finance investments
from internally generated funds. The provision of adequate funds by Govern-
ment to KNR was agreed to during negotiations.
v.        The Investment Plan, including adequate yard facilities in the
Seoul area, was agreed to by KNR, the Government and the Bank during
negotiations. It was also agreed during negotiations that no substantial
changes would be made in the Investment Plan without agreement with the
Bank.
vi.       The management of KNR is generally satisfactory, and the efficiency
of operations is high. Maintenance of property and equipment is satisfactory.
However, for full implementation of commercial accounting adopted from 1971,
there is need for procedural improvements, and measures for this were
agreed upon during negotiations.
vii.      The Investment Plan and the project have been found to be tech-
nically and economically justified. The economic rate of return for the Plan
investments is about 20%. The financial position of KNR has deteriorated and,
in 1971, there was an operating deficit rather than a rate of return of 7% as
specified in Credit 183-K0. A decline in passenger traffic, slower freight
traffic growth than anticipated, and rise in costs without any compensating
tariff adjustments have caused this situation. To remedy it, Government al-
lowed KNR to increase its freight tariffs by an average of 20% from February
1972; some comuter passenger fares were also raised. These measures
would enable MR to have a small operating surplus in 1972, but are insufficient
to improve KNR's finances adequately. Further freight tariff adjustments
are needed (no revision of passenger tariffs is proposed for another two
years in view of the competitive position and the fact that they now cover
full costs). This question was discussed with KNR and Government during
negotiations and specific financial targets and tariff measures have been
agreed upon.
viii.     The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$40 million equivalent to the Republic of Korea for a term of 25 years, in-
cluding a four-year period of grace. The loan should be passed on to KNR as
beneficiary on identical terms.



KOREA
FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Republic of Korea and the Korean National
Railroad (KNR) have asked the Bank for a loan of US$40 million equivalent
to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of KNR's Investment Plan for
1972-1974, which is part of the third Five-Year Economic Development Plan
of Korea, 1972-1976. KNR's investments during these three years are esti-
mated at Won 105.9 billion (US$264.8 million equivalent), with a foreign
exchange component of US$156.5 million equivalent. The Plan and the proj-
ect are designed to enable KNR to satisfy the requirements of increased
traffic which it would have to carry uith the growth of the economy. The
project includes the completion of electrification of 350 km of lines
(carrying heavy bulk traffic) started under the last Plan, electrification
of some lines in the Seoul suburban area, acquisition of passenger cars
and freight cars, track and bridge strengthening and renewal, provision of
marshalling yard facilities and rolling stock repair facilities. As in
previous Bank Group lending operations for KNR, the proposed loan would be
made to the Republic of Korea to be utilized by KNR, which is a Government
enterprise; the loan would finance specific goods, mainly imported; other
foreign currency requirements would be covered by various bilateral arrange-
ments and from the Governmento s own foreign exchange resources.
1.02      The Bank Group has helped finance three previous railway projects
in Korea: Credit 25-KO, US$14 million equivalent, in 1962; Credit 110-KO,
US$11 million equivalent, in 1967; and Credit 183-KO/Loan 669-KO, US$55 mil-
lion equivalent, in 1970. These helped to establish KNR as a separate entity
with appropriate powers and, by modernization of the railway and expansion
of its capacity, enabled it to play a vital role in the Korean economy and
handle the sharp increases in traffic generated by rapid economic growth.
Performance on these projects has been generally satisfactory and KNR has
maintained a high level of operational efficiency. However, deliveries of
some items included in the third project have been carried over; freight
cars, telecommunication equipment and certain track equipment covered under
the last loan are now expected to be received during 1972 and 1973. KNR's
financial situation deteriorated in 1970 and 1971. Some tariff measures
have been taken in 1972 by Government and KNR to remedy the situation, but
these are inadequate and further specific measures were agreed upon during
negotiations.
1.03      The other Bank Group assistance for transportation in Korea has
consisted of a grant of US$200,000 in 1965 for a Transportation Survey, a
credit (S4-KO) for US$3.5 million in 1968 for highway and transport coordi-
nation studies, which was incorporated into a loan of US$54.5 million (Loan
769-KO) in 1971 for a highway project. The latter includes the construction
of 372 km of a primary national highway; some feasibility and detailed en-
gineering studies; a highway maintenance study and establishment of a high-
way maintenance organization in a "pilot" province. The Bank is also the



Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed ports study currently under way; the
study is likely to result in a project suitable for future Bank financing.
,04      This appraisal is based on information supplied by the Government
of Kozea and the Korean National Railroad and on the findings of the December
1971 Bank appraisal mission, composed of Messrs. Tachibana,5Nanjundiah and
Abe. The report was prepared by them and edited by Miss V. Foster.
2. BACKGROUND
A.   Transport Sector
2.01      The very rapid expansion of income, production and international
trade in Korea has been accompanied by growing transport demand. During
the period 1962-1970, gross national product increased by nearly 11% per
annum, the value of exports by 30%, and that of imports by 25%. As part of
this growth, domestic passenger traffic in all modes, in terms of pass-km,
increased by about 11% annually, freight traffic in ton-km by about 13% and
international traffic by 22%. Due to rapid economic growth and to relative-
ly modest investments in the transport infrastructure during the first Five-
Year Plan period (1962-1966), the overall transport system capacity was se-
verely strained. The situation improved during the second Five-Year Plan
period, with active investment in the railroad and the development of high-
ways, as well as road transport and coastal shipping. Transport capacity
still needs to be augmented, however, to meet present and anticipated fu-
ture demands.
2.02      The Korean transport system is influenced by the hilly nature of
the country (about two-thirds of the land surface is hilly); the concentra-
tion of economic activity and population around the Seoul-In Cheon and Pu San
areas; the location of domestic natural resources e.g., coal, iron ore and
limestone, in the north, northeast and center of the country; a long coast-
line with increasing industrial activity; and important economic dependence
on exports of manufactured goods and imports of bulk raw materials.
2.03      The growth of traffic in each mode is shown in Table 1.  KNR has
been handling substantial quantities of bulk and industrial commodities and
considerable passenger traffic, although its share of the total traffic has
been decreasing. Road transport has the largest share of passenger traffic
(66% in 1970) and has captured the bulk of the increase in traffic. During
1962-1970, total pass-km by all modes increased from 11.5 to 30.3 billion,
and 77% of the increase was accounted for by road transport. KNR continued
to handle the bulk of freight traffic (58% of the total freight ton-km in
1970), but there has been a large increase in coastal traffic. Of the total
freight traffic increase in ton-km during 1962-1970, 46% accrued to coastal
shipping, 43% to KNR and 11% to the highway. There was a spectacular growth
in port traffic, due mainly to increases in imports of bulk commodities such
as oil, grain and lumber and in coastal cargoes such as fuel, coal and cement.



2.04      The physical aspects of KNR are described in Chapter 3 and those
of other modes in Annex 1. Road transport is characterized by the limited
length of paved roads (about 10% of the total network) and the relatively
small number of vehicles (one vehicle per 247 persons in 1970) for Korea's
level of economic development. The limited length of network is due mainly
to the low priority given to roads until 1968 and the fact that, since that
time, a large part of the higiway funds was allocated to the construction
of two four-lane toll expressways - Seoul-Pu San (428 km) and Seoul-In Cheon
(29.5 km). Most of the roads are badly aligned, narrow, poorly drained and
either roughly surfaced with gravel or unsurfaced. The small number of ve-
hicles in the country reflects the restrictions on their importation, which
had severely limited the number available until 1967, when domestic assem-
bly was started.
2.05      The infrastructure in ports also has capacity limitations.  Cur-
rently, the most important ports are those at In Cheon and Pu San, and both
of them are chronically congested. The Government has been constructing
various ports recently to serve new industrial complexes, e.g., Pohang, Ul
San, and Ma San. A development study of Korea's main ports is currently
under way, with UNDP financing; the Bank is the Executing Agency for the
study.
2.06      The role of coastal shipping has been increasing (32% of the total
freight traffic, in ton-km, in 1970) due mainly to the construction of indus-
trial complexes on coastal locations and the shortage of rail and road capac-
ity.
2.07      Korea, like other countries, has been aiming at achieving a greater
share of merchant shipping. About 24% of the total foreign trade tonnage has
been carried by Korean vessels during the past three years.
2.08      Air transport remains comparatively unimportant.  The privately
owned Korean Airlines (KAL) provides domestic and some international flights;
Korea is also served by other international airlines. Most traffic is han-
dled at the Seoul-Kimpo International Airport. Air freight traffic is minor.
B.   Transport Investment and Coordination
2.09      Recognizing the inacdquacy of the investments in the transport in-
frastructure during the first Five-Year Plan period, which created bottle-
necks in transport, Government increased the allocation for transport infra-
structure in the second Five-Year Plan (1967-1971), to about 26% of the total
capital formation. However, the use of funds was not always in accordance
with economic priority because alternative solutions were not studied.
Transport planning and coordination have been inadequate. Responsibility
for planning has been scattered; the Ministry of Construction (MDC) has been
responsible for road and port construction, and the Ministry of Transport
(MDT) for airports, the railways, shipping and road transport regulations.
The Economic Planning Board (EPB) has been the only organization in a posi-
tion to coordinate transport investments, but it has not been staffed for
this purpose. Annex 2 describes the functions of different agencies re-
lated to the transport sector.



- 4 -
2.10      To provide a basis for improving transport planning and coordina-
tion, a study was financed under Credit S4-KO and carried out by consultants
"CEOM/NEDECO (France/Netherlands). Based on this study, Credit Agreement
183-KO provided that measures to achieve adequate coordination in transport
would be agreed with the Bank Group. The consultants' final report (May
1970) suggested, as a long-term solution, placing responsibility for all
transport modes under one Ministry. This was not acceptable to Government.
Toward the end of 1969 and the beginning of 1970, Government set up a three-
tiered organization responsible for transport planning and coordination:
the Transport Coordination Y-inisters Conference (TCMC), the Transport Coor-
dination Working Group (TCWG) and the Transport Planning Office (TPO) with-
in MOT (Annex 2). It was intended that TPO would be responsible for under-
taking economic analysis and rendering professional advice to TCMC on in-
vestment planning and important policy measures including licensing, pricing
and taxation within the subsectors of transport. However, substantive is-
sues relating to investment planning and policy measures have not received
adequate attention, despite their importance in view of the expected large
investments in the transport sector during the Plan period (about 24% of to-
tal capital formation).
2.11      Organizational changes as a means to improve transport planning and
coordination can have effect only if the need therefor is fully realized and
accepted, and there is a change in the general attitude. TCMC meets only
rarely and senior Government officials have only recently begun to realize
the importance of transport planning and coordination. Successful economic
development in the past, with economic policies largely dictated at a high
level and carried through with tenacious regard for physical achievements,
makes it difficult to expect changes in attitudes, except gradually. The
effort to convince the Government at the higher level of the need for proper
planning and coordination should be continued; meanwhile, in the immediate
term there are certain areas in which improvement is required and where
specific action is feasible. This matter was discussed during negotiations
and an action program agreed upon. To make the work of TCMC, TCWG and TPO
more effective even within the present organizational structure, the
functions and work program of TPO, including the collection and preparation
of sound data relating to costs and operation of all modes of transport,
will be reviewed and TPO will furnish periodical reports thereon to the
Bank. Also, there is to be an early strengthening of the economic expertise
in TPO by direct appointment and/or training. (This is also partly covered
by the financing of training of TPO staff under the First Highway Loan,
Loan 769-KO, 1971.) Further, a Government directive will be issued to all
relevant Goverrment agencies including MC to ensure that all major invest-
ment proposals related to transport are passed to TPO for economic appraisal
and coordination purposes.

3. THE KOREAN NATIONAt. RAILROAD
A.   Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      In 1963, in accordance with the Government Organization Law required
under Credit Agreement 25-KO, KNR was established as a semi-autonomous agency
within the Government with an independent manager and its own budget and ac-
counting (Organization Chart of KNR, Annex 3). Government exercises control
over KNR in staff, financial and budgetary matters. KNR has been given
greater autonomy in financial matters since 1970/71, following the agreement
reached at the time of the sanction of the last loan and credit.
3.02      The management of KNR is generally satisfactory.  Shortage of senior
qualified engineering, economic and accounting staff, coupled with the size
and complexity of KNR's investment program, led to extensive employment of con-
sultants to study several aspects of railway operation and investment needs.
Consultants (from Japan) are employed by KNR in connection with the elec-
trification of KNR lines in the Seoul suburban area as part of the rapid tran-
sit project for the Seoul metropolitan area. A program for training of se-
lected KNR operational and engineering staff at intermediate level is current-
ly under way and is satisfactory. Training of accounting staff in the imple-
mentation of the commercial accounting system needs to be continued and care-
fully watched by KNR management; this question was discussed with KNR
during negotiations and it was confirmed that the training program is
proceeding satisfactorily.
3.03      The level of staff remuneration in KNR has been lower than that of
industrial and commercial enterprises in Korea. To improve the position and
ensure that sufficient qualified personnel are available, KNR has, at Gov-
ernment direction and in common with other Government enterprises, progres-
sively increased salaries and other remuneration. Increases of 30% from
July 1969 and further increases of 20% from April 1970, 15% from April 1971
and 15% from April 1972 have been sanctioned to KNR, as for other Government
employees. These measures, together with other factors such as status as
Government employees, have enabled KNR to retain sufficient qualified person-
nel. Even with these increases in wages and salaries, the total staff costs
in 1971 were only about 41% of operating expenses, which is low in relation
to other railways.
3.04      The number of permanent employees with Government employee status
was about 34,900 in 1971; this was less than the peak figure of 35,684 em-
ployees in 1969. In addition to the permanent employees, KNR employed about
3,300 workshop personnel, 1,070 security personnel and 3,800 temporary per-
sonnel. The traffic unit (ton-km + pass-km) per employee (taking total
employees) during 1971 was 385,000, which is good compared with most other
railways (Malaysia 165,000; Columbia 122,000; Egypt 130,000; New Zealand
150,000). There is, however, scope for further improvement in efficiency
and some mechanization, both of which are in progress and should be aided
by the implementation of the investments under the proposed project. KNR
plans some further reductions in staff strength.



3.05      There is only one labo.- union, and relations with management are
good.  In general, the staff displays excellent discipline and industrious-
< RaIway Property
3.06      The present position with regard to railway property and the con-
text in which improvements are now planned are described in Annex 4. It will
be seen that track has been generally well maintained. With the growth of
traffic, however, especially on the double track main lines and the lines
from Seoul to the northeastern part of Korea (the industrial lines) which
carry heavy volumes of bulk commodities and are being electrified (Map), a
change in maintenance procedures is necessary and the track must be improved.
This, together with bridge renewals and strengthening on these lines, is now
planned. Modernization of signalling and telecommunication facilities is also
required and is being undertaken. It will be seen that marshalling yard fa-
-ilities, particularly in the Seoul area, need to be augmented; in the light
of consultants' studies made by Touche Ross & Co. (Canada), the plans of KNR,
after the revision of their proposals regarding the new connection to the
3econd In Cheon port, were inadequate to cater to these requirements. This
question was discussed with KNR during negotiations and provision of suitable
facilities included in KNR's investment Plan.
3.07      KNR's motive power and rolling stock position at the end of 1971 is
given in Table 2. KNR is mostly dieselized, but has some steam locomotives
which would phased out by 1974 (except for 7 locomotives for narrow gauge
lines and 17 reserved for emergency use). Electric locomotives will be intro-
duced in 1972 and their number will go up to 66 by 1974. About 400 (approxi-
mately 25% of the total fleet) of KNR's passenger cars are over-aged Manchu-
rian railways' or second-hand American railways' cars in poor condition; their
replacement is now planned. About 2,300 freight cars are over 30 years old
and are in poor condition. They are to be replaced during the Plan period.
3.08      KNR's facilities for maintenance and repair of locomotives and rolling
stock need to be improved and reorganized (Annex 4). KNR's plans regarding
reorganization of Seoul workshop (which will, in the future, undertake repair
of electric railcars used in suburban service and electric locomotives) should
be reviewed from the overall coordination point of view by the consultants
(Japanese) engaged in connection with the Seoul suburban electrification
project. Agreement was reached with KNR regarding this matter during negotia-
tions.
C.   Traffic and Operations
(i) Freight traffic
3.09      KNR's freight traffic statistics from 1964 through 1971 are shown
in Table 3. During this period, freight traffic grew about 7% per annum in
tonnage and 8% per annum in ton-km. This growth was mainly attributable to
increases in commercial traffic (as distinct from military and KNR's service
freight) which grew annually at 8% in tonnage and 9% in ton-km. The average



freight transport distance increased from 223 km in 1964 to 245 km in 1971,
due mainly to the recent deveLopment of industrial complexes away from tradi-
tional traffic centers.
3.10      Bulk comnnodities including coal, cement, oil, ore, fertilizer and
grains constituted 82% of KNR's total freight ton-km in 1971. The composi-
tion of the bulk commodities in KNFWs commercial traffic in 1971 was as fol-
lows:
tonnage                       ton-km

Coal                                     12.1        41.6                    39.5
Cement                                    5.8        19.9                    16.8
Oil                                       2.5         8.6                     9.9
Ore                                       1.6         5.5                     5.8
Grain                                     1.4         4.8                     5.5
Fertilizer                                1.1         3.8                     4.7
Subtotal                                24.5         84.2                    82.2
Others                                    4.6        15.8                    17.8
Total                                    29.1       100.0                   100.0
"Others," which consists mainly of general goods suitable for highway trans-
port, declined from 5.8 million tons in 1968 to 4.6 million tons in 1971.
Part of this decline was due to a shortage of motive power and freight cars,
which eased only in the latter part of 1971; part was due to development of
highway transport. Coastal shipping was also used, especially for coal and
cement; the Government allowed some subsidies to consignors for such coal
movements. With the easing of rail transport capacity in 1971, rail traffic
in coal increased and the subsidies were discontinued.
3.11      The most dense sections of KNR lines for freight traffic are be-
tween the Seoul area and the northeastern part of Korea - the "industrial
lines," which carry large volumes of coal and cement. These are followed
in density by the lines between Seoul and Pu San (density chart, Annex 5).
Freight net ton-km per route-km of KNR was 2.44 million in 1971.
3.12      KNR freight traffic in 1972 is now expected to be lower than in
1971 due mainly to a slower prowth in the *oommw err ean interruntior in
the rail traffic on the industrial lines caused by flood damage to the track in
August 1972. Freight traffic, in tonnage, is expected to increase on average



-8-
about 5.8% per annum during 1973-1976, with commercial traffic growth (exclud-
ing military and service) averaging 6.0% per annum. In 1976, freight traffic
Ls expected to reach 40 million tons as against 32 million tons in 1971. This
:rowth rate would be lower than the rate of growth in 1964-1971, reflecting
the diversification of the economy and the increased role of other modes of
transport. Table 4 shows the freight traffic forecast, which also takes
into account the expected developments in the production and distribution
of coal, cement and other industries. Although the bulk commodities will
continue to be of prime importance to KNR freight traffic (85% of commercial
freight ton-km), the composition of such commodities is likely to be somewhat
different in 1976. The proportion of total freight movements accounted for
by fertilizer and cement is likely to increase, while the relative propor-
tions of coal and oil may go down.
(ii) Passenger Traffic
3.13      Table 5 shows KNR's passenger statistics from 1964 to 1971.  During
the period 1964-1969, passenger traffic increased by 5.5% per annum in number
of passengers and by 8.5% in pass-km, mainly attributable to long-distance
passengers. Passenger traffic has been sensitive to changes in passenger
fares; a fare rise of about 30% in 1970, at the same time as the highway im-
provements and the opening of the Seoul-Pu San expressway (428 km), with a
large number of air-conditioned buses put into operation, resulted in a sharp
reduction in the non-commuter rail passenger traffic. In 1971, the long-
distance passenger (other than military passenger) traffic declined to 85.2
million in number of passengers and 7.3 billion pass-km as against 114.8 mil-
lion passengers and 9.7 billion pass-km in 1969. Expressway bus passengers
in 1971 are estimated at 22 million passengers and 3.1 billion pass-km.
3.14      The major factors which affect the relative use of expressway buses
and rail passenger services seem to be the fares charged, the frequency of
services, and the degree of comfort offered to the passengers. KNR runs no
less than 20 passenger trains a day each way between Seoul and Pu San (for
parts of this line the number is much greater) and eight of these - five
limited express trains and three super express trains - are slightly faster
than the expressway buses which take about six hours to cover the distance
between Seoul and Pu San (428 km). The expressway buses, however, are more
frequent, and the fares charged in 1971 between Seoul-Dae Jeon and Seoul-
Pu San generally approximated the limited express train fares even though
they offered air-conditioned accommodations, not provided on the limited
express trains. These factors contributed to the diversion of some rail
passenger traffic to the expressway buses. Even with the diversion, how-
ever, the occupancy of KNR trains has been generally good, although it has
dropped; the overcrowding of the trains has been reduced. KNR is making
efforts to improve the quality of its service - i.e., better ticket sale
facilities, more convenient timings, better cars and facilities. KNR's
costs for passenger traffic are low (on an average less than US41 per
pass-km). Passenger fares, however, have been well above fully distrib-
uted costs. In view of this, KNR does not propose to increase its pas-
senger fares for the present and has recently reduced fares selectively.
Fares charged by expressway buses were raised by about 23% from February



-9-
1972 but some selective reductions have been made from June 1972. Some of
the long distance passenger traffic could be expected to come back to the
railway, as indicated by the trend so far in 1972.
3.15      KNR commuter traffic around the major cities is significant but
does not cover even variable costs (paras. 3.25 and 3.26). In 1971, it
represented 32% of the total number of passengers and about 11% of the pass-km,
a large part in the Seoul suburban area. With the rapid growth of popula-
tion in Seoul (present population about 5.5 million) and the need to allevi-
ate the traffic congestion, a mass rapid transit project covering the con-
struction of a subway by Seoul City and electrification of KNR lines in the
Seoul suburban area has been taken up, with technical and financial assis-
tance from Japan. The electrification of KNR's Seoul suburban lines is ex-
pected to be ready in 1974. After the completion of the subway and KNR
electrification, commuter traffic on KNR will increase sharply, as traffic
carried by local buses and taxis in the congested city will divert to rail
and subway (for the effect on KNR finances, see para. 6.12). The average
distance traveled by commuters will drop as a result.
3.16      Passenger traffic forecasts are given in Table 5.  They incorporate
the effect of the increase in commuter traffic after suburban electrification
and the recent trend in KNR passenger traffic, which registered a 19% in-
crease in passenger km during the first half of 1972. Cammuter traffic is
expected to rise to 150 million passengers and 1.65 billion pass-km in 1976;
long distance (including military) traffic is expected to increase to 102.7
million passengers and about 9.6 billion pass-km in 1976. Long distance
passenger traffic, however, is expected to rise only slightly as the paving
program and the construction of expressways continue, especially in sections
other than Seoul-Pu San and the Seoul suburban area.
(iii) Operations
3.17      Table 6 gives a summary of operating statistics from 1967 to 1971.
It shows that operating efficiency is generally good. Steam traction is
mostly confined to shunting services, and only about 1.5% of the train-km
are steam operated (against 36% in 1963); steam operation will be practically
eliminated (except for use of seven locomotives on narrow gauge) by 1974, when
the electrification of industrial lines is completed.
3.18      The availability of diesel locomotives at 88% in 1971 is satisfac-
tory, but can be further improved by adequate repair facilities and increased
attention to the provision for stores and spares. The daily output of 429 km
per engine available is good. Availability of diesel railcars is only 67%
and needs improvement. KNR is aiming at an availability of 85% and intends
implementing the recommendation of the consultants (Touche Ross & Co.) regard-
ing provision of components, replacement of some engines, etc.
3.19      The utilization of passenger cars is good.  The average daily run
per passenger vehicle available is 330 km; the pass-km per annum per vehicle
available is nearly 6 million, which can be attained only with a high occu-
pancy of passenger cars. KNR will have to improve the quality of its pas-
senger service, especially in the increasingly competitive situation, and



- 10 -
such improvement would tend to bring down these figures. The availability
of passenger cars, 84% in 1971, needs improvement. The workshop and running
shed facilities now planned and the acquisition of new cars to replace over-
aged cars in poor condition should enable the availability to increase to 90%
by 1976.
3.20      Freight cars carry close to their effective capacity; the average
load of freight cars has increased from 33.4 tons in 1967 to 37.8 tons in
1971. Freight car productivity of 580,000 ton-km per freight car available
in 1971 was very high compared with other railways (Germany 235,000; France
251,000). This is excellent performance from a statistical point of view,
but it is also a sign that demand exceeds supply and customer service is
likely to be affected. With growing competition, KNR must further improve
the quality of its service.
3.21      To maintain a good operating performance and ensure optimum utiliza-
tion of the rolling stock, improvement in marshalling yards, installation of
adequate loading and unloading facilities, signalling improvenents etc. would
be needed. KNR's efforts to improve operations include the recent introduc-
tion of more block trains for coal movement.
D.   Tariffs and Costs
3.22      KNR, in common with all Government enterprises, must have its tar-
iffs approved by the Government, after a review by a rate-making "Committee
for Decisions on Utility and Public Enterprise Commodity Rates" headed by the
Deputy Prime Minister; tariffs approved by the Government are incorporated in
KIR's budgets, which are subject to approval by the National Assembly.
3.23      Details of the freight rate and passenger fare structure are given
in Annex 6. Tariffs are generally low; tariff increases granted during the
second Five-Year Plan period (1967-1971) were as follows:
Freight rates                Passenger fares
October 1, 1967                             30%                            50%
May 1969                                    15%
accompanying change
in commodity classi-
fication
December 1969                                                              30%
The tariff increases have barely matched cost increases in the case of
freight rates, which have been held at low levels as a matter of policy (Gov-
ernment also exercises control on the prices of essential commodities). The
average revenue per ton-km of Won 1.5 in 1971, equivalent to only US0O.65 per
ton-km, is low by any international standard. During 1970 and 1971, average
revenue per ton-km, in terms of constant 1967 Won, was less than in 1967,
thus indicating a decline in freight rates, in real terms.



- 11 -
3.24      A high degree of utilization of rail facilities and rolling stock
maintains the costs at a generally low level. A traffic costing study (1970)
made by the consultants (Touche Ross & Co.) showed the 1968 costs and suggest-
ed some improvements in traffic costing procedures employed by KNR. These
recommendations are proposed to be implemented by KNR, but progress has been
slow on account of staff and training problems. Recently, however, KNR has
trained some staff and strengthened the costing section. KNR's analysis of
costs indicated that, during 1970, the average fully distributed costs were
about 1.4 Won (USd0.38) per pass-km and 1.9 Won (US40.51) per freight ton-km
(in current Won). These costs are slightly understated, as KNR's provision
for maintenance was below the optimum level and the depreciation provision
was also somewhat understated. Even allowing for these, the costs of rail
transport are low.
3.25      The studies also show that commuter traffic did not cover even
variable costs, but other passenger fares have been well above fully dis-
tributed costs; freight rates, although generally covering variable costs,
have been below full costs. In view of growing competition, KNR should
correct the present situation of excessive dependence upon passenger traf-
fic for its net revenues while carrying substantial quantities of freight
traffic, mostly bulk commodities, which do not make adequate contribution to
the fixed costs. The consultants (Touche Ross & Co.) made some suggestions
regarding needed freight tariff changes.
3.26      Under Credit 183-KO, KNR was required to revise the tariffs, taking
account of the consultants' recommendations, information obtained from traf-
fic cost analyses and the conditions of competition from other modes of trans-
port. Such revision was to be effective by July/August 1971. However, Govern-
ment allowed KNR to make freight tariff increases only from February 1972.
These changes are expected to raise the average tariff by 20%. In addition to
the freight tariff increases, KNR also increased mail carriage charges and com-
muter passenger fares, by reducing the discounts to students and general com-
muters (see Annex 6 for details of cha:Ages); effective commuter fares are now
likely to cover variable costs. These tariff changes are, however, insuffi-
cient to adequately improve the financial situation of KNR, which deteriorated
in 1971 (Chapter 6). Further freight tariff adjustments are urgently needed.
The tariff structure has somewhat improved, but further improvement is needed.
Passenger tariffs should not be increased at this time in view of the com-
petitive situation and the fact that they cover full costs.
E.   Bueget, Accounts and Audit
3.27      Until recently, KNR maintained accounts and prepared operating and
capital budgets in two forms, one as laid down for Government departments and
the other based on an enterprise accounting system (commercial) installed by
the consultants (Booz, Allen and Hamilton International) financed under Cred-
it 25-K0. This led to insufficient attention to commercial accounting and
duplication of work. As agreed under Credit 183-K0, Government authorized
KNR to abandon the Government form of accounting from January 1971 and to
maintain its accounts and financial statements solely in accordance with the
commercial accounting system. However, the actual progress of KNR in fully



- 12 -
implementing the system is slow. The external auditors who examined KNR's
1970 accounts during 1971 have drawn attention to several procedural and in-
ternal check deficiencies, besides some routine inaccuracies. The procedural
ieficiencies indicate that the system has not been designed in sufficient de-
tail. To assist in rectifying the position and implementing commercial
accounting and mechanization of accounting work, it was agreed
during negotiations that KNR would obtain the services of Consultants
acceptable to the Bank upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
A time phased program would be drawn up, with the assistance of Consultants,
for full implementation of the system by January 1975.
3.28      KNR's budgets are subject to approval of the National Assembly;
budgets are very detailed. Increased powers were delegated to the Director
General of KNR in mid-1970. The Economic Planning Board (EPB) reviews the
budget allocations quarterly; this action has no adverse effect on its opera-
tions. Apart from KNR's capital budget, funds are sometimes allocated from
the "Economic Development Special Account" to KNR (as to other enterprises),
usually in the form of grants, for investments required from an overall point
of view. Besides this, a separate "Railroad Fund" has been established under
a special law; some projects are taken up from this, outside the normal budget,
e.g., development of land for commercial purposes and the construction of the
"Transport Center" building in Seoul, which also houses KNR's headquarters of-
fices. MNR's accounts are audited by independent auditors as required under
Credit 183-KO.
4. THE PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.  The Plan
4.01      KNR's Investment Plan forms part of the third Five-Year Economic
Development Plan of Korea, 1972-1976. This Plan was discussed and agreed
with KNR and Government during appraisal but subsequently KNR advised a
change regarding the In Cheon port line. With this revision, there was
need for a substitute provision in order that marshalling yard facilities
in the Seoul area would be adequate (Annex 4). The question was discussed
with KNR and Government during negotiations and the Investment Plan suitably
revised. The Investment Plan 1972-1976 as now agreed between the KNR,
Government and the Bank involves a total investment of Won 135.8 billion
(US$339.5 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of US$180.9
million equivalent. This includes works carried over from the 1967-1971
Investment Plan, such as electrification of industrial lines, yard facilities
etc. It was also agreed during negotiations that substantial changes in
the Plan would be made only with the agreement of the Bank.
4.02      The composition and cost of the works now included in the Plan are
shown in detail in Table 7, a summary of which is given below (see Annex 7
for a description of the main items):

4.03      The Plan as now drawn up is conservative with regard to freight
car and passenger requirements and assumes continued high utilization as
at present. (See Tables 8 and 9 showing calculations of requirements and
Table 10 indicating stock at end 1974 and 1976.) Better yard and terminal
facilities and signalling improvements with the planned investments may
make this possible; however, the need for improvements in the quality of
service may make the acquisition of some more freight cars and passenger
cars desirable, especially in the latter part of the Plan period. It was
agreed during negotiations that the situation should be reviewed by KNR in
early 1974, in consultation with the Bank.

B.   The Project and the Proposed Loan
4.04      The project consists of the first three years of KNR's Investment
Plan 1972-1976 (Table 11). It includes the completion of the electrification
of industrial lines already started, electrification of KNR lines in the
Seoul suburban area as part of the rapid transit project for the Seoul metro-
politan area (Annex 8); construction of a connecting link to the second In
Cheon port; installation of Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) in the Seoul
area; improvements to marshalling yards and freight handling facilities;
complete track and rail renewals; procurement of track maintenance and re-
newal equipment; bridge strengthening and renewal; acquisition of passenger
and freight cars (including 1,949 cars already ordered and being financed
under Credit 183-KO/Loan 669-K0); improvement of facilities for repair of
motive power and rolling stock; and provision of essential telecommunication
facilities (also financed under Credit 183-K0/Loan 669-KO). The total cost
of the project is estimated at Won 105.9 billion (US$264.8 million equiva-
lent) with a foreign exchange component of about US$156.5 million, of which
US$40 million would be covered by the proposed loan. A breakdown of the

4.05      Investments included in the project but not selected for the pro-
posed loan either will be financed by other sources or are unsuitable for
Bank financing, since it is not proposed to adopt international competitive
.Adding procedures.
4.06      The project costs are based on latest prices and are reasonable.
Contingency provision has been made on the basis of price increases of 6%
per annum in regard to local costs and 4% per annum in regard to foreign cur-
rency costs, except where firm price contracts have been entered into already
(e.g., freight cars financed under Credit 183-KO/Loan 669-KO) and in the case
of the Seoul suburban electrification scheme (where provision for contingen-
cies is already included in the costs which are largely financed from a
specific Yen credit). Price contingencies now represent about 7.5% of total
project costs. No separate provision for physical contingencies is necessary
considering the nature of the items included and the fact that the KNR budget
is expressed more in monetary than in physical terms.
4.07      As shown in detail in Table 12, procurement of rails and track
material, track equipment, bridge girders and erection equipment, plant and
machinery for workshop and running sheds, passenger cars and breakdown cranes
would be covered under the proposed loan.
4.08      KNR is competent, with the help of consultants already engaged for
the telecommunications study and the electrification of suburban lines, to
carry out the project.
C.   Procurement and Disbursement
4.09      All items to be financed by the proposed loan would be acquired
through international competitive bidding. Local firms would be in a posi-
tion to bid for bridge girders (estimated cost approximately US$1.2 million)
and possibly ordinary passenger cars (but not air-conditioned cars or power
cars). There are local firms which have capability and experience in the
fabrication of bridge girders. In the case of ordinary passenger cars, how-
ever, only KNR has previously manufactured some cars in its In Cheon shop.
This shop is now used for repair and KNR does not intend to manufacture the
cars. Since there are no Korean firms with previous experience in the manu-
facture of passenger cars, it was agreed during negotiations that the local
bidders would be prequalified; procedures therefore would be established in
consultation with the Bank. For the purpose of bid evaluation, domestic
preferred bidders (where the value added in Korea would be not less than 20%
of the exfactory bid price) would be accorded a preference margin of 15% of
the c.i.f. bid price or the level of customs duties and other import taxes
which a nonexempt importer would have to pay for the goods offered in the bid,
whichever would be lower.
4.10      If Korean firms are permitted to bid and are successful, some local
expenditure financing would be implied, since the local currency component of
ordinary passenger cars constructed in Korea is estimated at 60%, a total of
about US$7 million equivalent for 209 passenger cars. Total local currency
component financing would, however, not exceed US$8 million equivalent. Dis-
bursements would therefore be made as follows:



- 17 -
100% of the CIF tost of imported equipment and materials; and/or
100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment and
materials.
Any savings under the loan would be used to finance additional but similar
project items subject to review and agreement with the Bank.
4.11      The estimated quarterly rate of disbursement (Table 13) is based
on the assumption that the Bank loan would become effective by December 1972.
D.   Financing of the Project
4.12      Foreign exchange costs of the industrial lines electrification pro-
ject would be covered by the assistance of a consortium of European manufac-
turers (Belgium, France, Germany and Switzerland). A special Yen credit of
27.24 billion Yen (US$88.4 million equivalent) has been given by Japan to
Korea for the Seoul metropolitan area Rapid Transit Project (Annex 8); of
this about US$50 million equivalent is relent by Government to KNR to cover
the foreign exchange costs of the Seoul Suburban Electrification Scheme
(including provision of electric cars) and some local cost financing. (The
Government loan to KNR bears interest at 5% per annum and is to be repaid in
20 years including five years of grace.) KNR is negotiating with Kreditanstalt
Fur Wiederaufbau (KFW), a loan to cover the foreign exchange cost for
providing CTC in the Seoul area (about US$5.43 million equivalent). The
following summary indicates the financing of the proposed project:

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   The Economic Role of KNR
5.01      The growth of transport requirements and the present evolution from
a virtual single mode (railroad) to a multiple transport system has resulted
in the dominant role of KNR being diminished. The planned developments in
the highways, coastal shipping and port capacities during the third Five-Year
Plan will have their impact on the role of KNR in the Korean economy and KNR
will face increasing competition. Nevertheless, KNR will continue to perform
an important economic role. The physical and economic features (para. 2.02)



- 18 -
of Korea assign an important role to KNR as a carrier of substantial quantities
of bulk commodities (coal, cement, ore, fertilizer, etc.) for which the railway
is particularly suited. With good traffic densities on many sections of the
railway lines, and good operating performance, costs are generally low and,
if KNR pays adequate attention to the quality of service, it could continue
to carry substantial volumes of freight and passenger traffic. In these cir-
cumstances, it is in Korea's economic interests to optimize the benefits of
the considerable investments already made in the railway.
5.02      The investments envisaged in the transport sector during the third
Five-Year Plan period (1972-1976) and the typical comparative transport fares
and tariffs are shown in Tables 14, 15 and 16. Considering the capacities of
the various modes of transport and the traffic demand in the future, and given
existing transport fares and tariffs, the proposed KNR Investment Plan would
bring substantial economic benefits to the country. If the Investment Plan is
not carried out, large tonnages of bulk commodities and some passengers would
have to be diverted at higher prices and costs to road and coastal shipping;
the problem of mass transport in Seoul City would become unmanageable; KNR's
operating costs would also rise.
B.   Economic Benefits
5.03      KNR's Investment Plan, part of the third Five-Year Plan of Korea
(1972-1976), has three important components:
(a)  Electrification of the industrial lines (Jung Ang, Tae Baeg
and Yeong Dong lines - involving 348.6 km of single line
track lines connecting Seoul to the northeast of Korea) and
associated investments on these lines such as track and
bridge renewals (covering about 25% of the project);
(b) Electrification of the Seoul suburban area of KNR and asso-
ciated investments in electric railcars and facilities for
their maintenance and repair and the provision of CTC (cover-
ing about 23% of the project) required in connection with the
Rapid Transit Project for the Seoul metropolitan area;
(c) Other investments, which cover track renewals and bridge
strengthening, track equipment, signalling and telecommunica-
tions, purchase of freight cars and passenger cars (mainly
for replacement), improvement of workshops and sheds, and
some yard and line facilities.
These major components are designed to ensure the efficient operation of KNR
by increasing its capacity to handle the growing traffic, avoiding increases
in its operating costs, and improving the quality of service and safety. De-
tailed economic return calculations are shown in Annex 9.
5.04      Electrification of the industrial lines and the associated invest-
ments are intended to create capacity to enable KNR to carry the already very
heavy and growing traffic between Seoul and the northeastern part of Korea



- 19 -
(where coal, iron ore and cement industries are located). This scheme was
begun during the second Five-Year Plan period and was also included in the
Third Railway Project. It was expected to be completed in 1973 and the econo-
mic rate of return assessed at 20%. The electrification of the lines is now
expected to be brought into operation in stages and completed by 1974. The
economic benefits will be in the form of savings in transportation costs by
avoiding diversions of the bulk traffic to road and coastal shipping trans-
port at higher cost; there will also be savings in operating costs due to
the use of electric traction. Based on a life of 25 years for the equipment
and facilities, the economic benefits would yield an economic return of about
20%.
5.05      The electrification of the Seoul suburban lines of KNR and the as-
sociated investments are important elements of the Rapid Transit Project for
the Seoul metropolitan area. The city of Seoul has at present a population
of 5.5 million and has been growing fast as a result of rapid growth in the
Korean economy and the shift of population to the urban area. The present
transport system consists mainly of bus and taxi service, and traffic con-
gestion is already acute. The Rapid Transit Project aims at decentralizing
the urban population into the suburban area and alleviating the present and
growing traffic congestion in the city. The economic benefits will be in
the form of savings in transportation costs by the substitution of rapid
mass transit passenger trains for the presently used bus and taxi transport-
tation. The economic rate of return is expected to be about 20%. Additional
benefits would accrue from mitigation of air pollution, savings caused by
reduction of traffic accidents, and savings in time for passengers. This
suburban electrification will also accelerate the decentralization of popu-
lation and community development along the lines and aid in improving land
usage.
5.06      Of the other items of the Investment Plan (para. 5.03), freight cars
now in the project include about US$19.8 million (over 7%), carried forward
from the third project, the economic rate of return of which was assessed at
26%. Similarly, telecommunication facilities and track equipment, also car-
ried forward, were assessed to have returns of 17% and 32%, respectively.
It is, however, necessary to make an assessment of the group of these works,
as the component works are interrelated for efficient train operation,
quality of service and safety, particularly in the prevailing situation in
KNR. Benefits attributable to an item would not fully materialize unless
some of the other items of work are also carried out. For example, the
replacement of some over-aged freight cars would obviate higher maintenance
costs and deterioration in the quality of services, and thus avoid diversion
of traffic; for this to be actually achieved, however, line and other facil-
ities should be adequate. The economic benefits generated by this group
of works, in the form of transportation cost savings in KNR's operating costs
and avoidance of diversion of traffic to other modes at higher cost and price,
indicate an economic rate of return of about 22%. Not included in these
quantifiable benefits are savings in freight time, savings caused by reduced
inventories of industries, reliability, and quality of service.
5.07      An assessment of the Investment Plan as a whole shows that the total
economic benefits would yield an economic return of 20%. The Plan
is fully justified.

6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Background
6.01      KNR had operating surpluses for several years.  During the first
three years of the second Five-Year Plan period (1967-1971), net operating
revenues increased significantly, but thn situation deteriorated in 1970,
and KNR had a small operating deficit in 1971. KNR is not required to make
a contribution to Government from its net revenues, but utilizes its net
revenues for financing investments, replacements and debt servicing; it also
receives assistance for investments from long-term foreign loans and short-
term local finance, in addition to capital grants from Government.
B.   Present position
6.02      The income accounts for the last five years are given in Table 17
and are summarized below:
Won billion
1967    1968    1969    1970    1971
Operating revenue                    19.91   27.41   31.71   33.05   31.24
Working expenses                   14.55   17.50   20.26   23.79   27.94
Depreciation                        2.54    3.68    3.56    3.94    3.91
Operating expenses                   17.09   21.18   23.82   27.73   31.85
Net Operating revenue (loss)          2.82    6.23    7.89    5.32   (0.61)
Non-operating revenue
(loss) Net                         (0.09)   0.89   (1.72)  (0.57)  (0.65)
Interest charges                      0.92    1.31    1.64    1.80    3.33
Net Income                          1.81    5.81    4.53    2.99   (4.59)
Operating ratio %                    85.8    77.3    75.1    83.9   101.9
The financial situation improved during 1967-1969 with increases in both
traffic and in tariffs; these more than offset the cost increases.  The
situation started deteriorating in 1970 and sharply declined in 1971.  The
main causes were: (a) decrease in passenger traffic (other than commuters)
during 1970 and 1971 (para. 3.13); (b) slow growth of freight traffic -
partly due to KNR's inability to carry traffic because of the shortage of
motive power and rolling stock, which eased only in the second half of 1971;
and (c) increase in prices generally and increases in staff costs - 20% from
April 1970 and 15% from 1971 - not compensated by freight tariff adjustments.
6.03      Interest and debt service coverage ratios varied between 2.7 and
5.4 and 1.7 and 4.9 respectively up to 1970; during 1971, debt service cover-
age was only about 0.3. During the 1967-1971 period, depreciation charges
averaged about 12.5% of gross operating revenue. While the rates of depre-
ciation provision are adequate, the actual provision in the last two years
appears somewhat low, as there was apparently delay in transferring completed



- 21 -
"works in progress" to fixed assets.  (With regard to track, roadbed, communi-
cations and power lines, no depreciation is charged; they are treated as
"replacement" assets, the replacement cost of which is charged to operation;
improvements are capitalized.)
6.04      The rate of return on average net fixed assets in use increased
from 1.8% in 1967 to 4.4% in 1969 and, at the time of project appraisal in
1969 for Credit 183-KO/Loan 669-KO, the prospect for further improvement ap-
peared good. However, for the reasons stated in paragraph 6.02, this proved
to be too optimistic and the rate of return declined to 2.9% in 1970 and was
negative in 1971.  KNR therefore did not achieve the 7% rate of return from
1971, specified in Credit 183-KO. KNR did, however, control the staff
strength and has reduced some staff. Recently KNR also deferred some main-
tenance expenditure, especially with regard to track, which is undesirable.
6.05      KNR's balance sheets as of December 31, 1969-1971 are shown in
Table 18 and are summarized below:

Total liabilities                                  200.0      211.2      254.5

6.06      KNR's first physical inventory and valuation of fixed assets was
completed in 1965 and the book value of assets was adjusted in that year.
The National Property Law requires the revaluation of National Controlled
Real Property every five years. However, as required under a USAID loan
of 1966, KNR carried out a further revaluation of its fixed assets as of
December 31, 1966 which took into account the substantial devaluation of the
Won in 1964 and the considerable increase in the value of land owned by KNR.
The revaluation increased the gross value of fixed assets by Won 74 billion
and capital surplus was increased correspondingly. KNR is currently under-
taking a revaluation of its fixed assets, as of December 31, 1971.
6.07      The summary balance sheets show that the current ratio has been
satisfactory during 1969-1971, but the liquid ratio was only 0.7 in 1971.



- 22 -
The debt/equity ratio increased to 32/68 in 1971. The debt as of December
31, 1971 includes IDA and Bank loans amounting to US$50.3 million, AID loans
anounting to about US$25.7 million, Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (Japan)
ioans of US$16.7 million and the utilization of the US$57 million loan extended
by the consortium of European manufacturers for the electrification of the in-
dustrial lines. The devaluation of the Won increases the Won liability for
loans payable in foreign currency. The devaluation losses are recorded by
KNR as a deferred charge and are amortized over future years as the loan
obligations are repaid.
C.   Future Prospects
6.08      The deterioration in KNR's financial situation has already had
adverse effects. Maintenance is tending to be reduced and some necessary in-
vestments get deferred, e.g., shortage of funds led to slower progress regard-
ing provision of yard facilities and of ground facilities for electrification,
thus resulting in a situation where electric locomotives are being received
before the investments necessary to permit their use have been completed. Rec-
ognizing the need to improve KNR's financial position, the Government allowed
KNR to revise the freight tariff and commuter passenger fares with effect from
February 1972 (para. 3.26). These increases would enable KNR to have an oper-
ating surplus in 1972, but are insufficient to improve KNR's situation ade-
quately, as there are cost increases; staff wages, for instance, were increased
by 15% from April 1972 and there is an increase in general price levels. KNR
intends to keep down staff strength and is planning some further reductions in
staff in conjunction with the modernization and improvements included in the
Investment Plan. Measures to improve revenue, particularly tariff adjustments,
are needed, however, for adequate improvement of finances.
6.09      The forecast income accounts based on the projected traffic growth
(paras. 3.12 and 3.16), increases in staff wages of 10% per annum in 1974
and 1976 with no increases during 1973 and 1975, increases in price levels
of 3% per annum (following the stabilization measures now being taken by
Korea), and tariff increases to improve KNR finances are given in Table 17,
which also shows separately the additional revenues to be raised (over
and above the revenue expected at 1972 fares and rates). The principal
assumptions on which the financial forecasts are made are outlined in Annex
10. The forecast income accounts are summarized below:

6.10      The question of financial targets for KNR and tariff adjustments
needed to improve its finances were discussed with KNR and Government
during negotiations. It was agreed that the objective should be for KNR
to generate funds adequate to fully cover its operating expenditure and
debt service obligations and finance a reasonable part of the investment
needs, including replacements. Keeping in view KNR's situation in regard
to investment needs and debt etc., it was agreed that KNR should aim at
progressively improving its position and achieve a rate of return of at least
2% on its net fixed assets in use by 1975, 3% by 1976 and 5% by 1978. These
are considered realistic targets in the present circumstances and KNR and
Government indicated that a determined effort will be made to achieve them.
Apart from cost reduction measures, including staff adjustment and implemen-
tation of the investment plan, tariff adjustments would be needed to achieve
the targets. The Government indicated that in view of the prevailing
economic situation and following the emergency measures taken recently (when
public utility charges have not been allowed to increase) rail tariff
increases cannot be immediately implemented. Rail freight tariffs would be
increased, on a selective basis, by an average of 20% with effect from a
date not later than January 1, 1974. However, if any relaxation in the
economic measures undertaken recently were to be made and as a result
thereof increases in public utility charges in Korea become feasible, the
increases in rail tariffs would be given priority and Government would endea-
vor to effect the increase referred to as soon as possible during 1973.
Further tariff adjustments would also be made in 1975 and 1976 - passenger
and freight tariffs will be increased from January 1975 by such a level as to
generate additional revenues equal to 20% of passenger revenues, and a
further freight tariff increase, on a selective basis, of an average of 20%
made from January 1976.  The forecasts indicated in para. 6.09 above incorporate
the results of these tariff adjusements.  These tariff increases may appear
somewhat large but it must be kept in view that rail freight tariffs have been
very low; KNR handles large volumes of bulk commodities particularly suited
to rail transport and, provided KNR pays attention to the quality of its
service, it should be able to give effect to the tariff increases without
losing traffic which would be economically justified for it to carry. Success
of these measures, especially the tariff increases in the later years, would
depend upon the strength of commercial action and service improvements
that KNR would provide.
6.11      If there is a change in the level of staff wage increases and
general price increases referred to in para. 6.09 above, or there are
other events affecting KNR, the tariff adjustments indicated in para. 6.10
above may be inadequate to achieve the financial targets referred to. In
order that appropriate remedial action is taken in time, when necessary,
KNR and the Government will review KNR's financial situation in October
of each year and furnish the results of such review to the Bank. If such
a review indicates the need for additional tariff increases or cost
reduction action, KNR and Government will consult the Bank and take
measures satisfactory to the Bank.
6.12      The question of fares when KNR starts operating the electrified
train services in conjunction with Seoul City, which will be in charge of



- 24 -
the subway, was discussed with KNR and Government and it was agreed that
KNR would be protected from losses as a result of operation of the services.
6.13      The forecast shows that the times interest ratio would increase
from 0.2 in 1973 to 0.9 in 1975 and 1.3 in 1976. Debt service coverage
would increase from 0.4 in 1972 to about 1 in 1975 and 1.2 in 1976. Govern-
ment assistance toward debt servicing would be required in 1972-1974
besides assistance for the investment program. Government agreed during
negotiations, to provide the funds and facilities required (including funds
required by KNR for servicing its debts) until completion of the project.
6.14      In order that KNR maintains a reasonable relationship between net
cash revenue and debt service requirements, the question of debt limitation
was discussed during negotiations. It was agreed that except for the Govern-
ment loans to KNR in 1972 and 1973 (which had already been determined and
also indicated to the Bank) Bank's agreement would be obtained before
incurring any debt if the net cash revenue of KNR for the fiscal year or the
12 consecutive months immediately before the date of incurrence, whichever
is greater, would be less than 1.2 times the maximum debt service requirement
of any succeeding fiscal year on all debt of KNR, including the debt to
be incurred.
6.15      The forecast balance sheet data are in Table 18 and cash flow
data in Table 19. The current and the liquid ratios would progressively
improve during 1972-1976 and vary from 1.5 to 2.2 and 0.9 to 1.3 respectively.
The debt/equity ratio would reach a peak of 40/60 in 1974 and go down to
38/62 in 1976.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
and INR on the following principal items:
(a) KNR's Investment Plan for the period 1972-1976; no substantial
changes to be made in the Investment Plan except by agreement
between KNR, Government and the Bank (para. 4.01).
(b) Government commitment regarding provision of funds and
facilities required, including funds required by KNR for
servicing its debts, until the completion of the project
(para 6.13).
(c) Financial targets for INR and tariff changes (para 6.10, 6.11
and 6.14).
(d) Specific measures for improving transport planning and
coordination (para. 2.11).

7.02      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$40
million to the Government for a term of 25 years, including a grace period
of about four years. The loan would be passed on to INR on identical terms.

Government Agencies Concerned with Transportation
I.   Ministries
1.   The Ministry of Transportation (MOT) is responsible for railroad
and civil aviation infrastructure works. It controls transport operations
for all modes, issues regulations, delivers licenses, performs cost calcula-
tions, sets rates and fares, collects transport statistics and undertakes
research.  It carries out its activities through four bureaus -- Land Trans-
portation, Marine Transportation, Civil Aviation and Tourism -- and exerts
control oover KNR.
2.   The Ministry of Construction (MOC) is responsible, among others,
for planning and construction of national highways and for planning, con-
struction and maintenance of major ports. It controls the Korean Highway
Corporation which is in charge of constructing, maintaining and operating
toll roads, and Korea Dredging Corporation. It is also responsible for
national and regional physical planning.
3.   The Economic Planning Board (EPB) is responsible for the Five-Year
Economic Development Plan, for the annual Overall Resources Budget, and for
the national budget. Hence, it reviews and makes final decisions on all in-
vestments including transport investment programs. Other functions of EPB
cover mobilization of the external resources and administration of price
policy including transport fares and rates of all modes.
4.   The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is responsible for farm
and forestry roads.
5.   The Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOCI) is responsible for
promoting and supervising assembly plants for motor vehicles, railway rolling
stock and shipbuilding.
6.   The Ministry of Finance  (MOF) is responsible for establishing and
collecting taxes related to transportation.
7.   The Ministry of H ome Affairs (MOIHA) is the highest authority over
all local government. It is responsible for administration and execution of
work on roads other than national highways and it administers various taxes,
such as the vehicle and the acquisition tax, to help finance transport works
by local authorities. MOHA is also in charge of the highway police.

II. New Bodies for Transport Coordination
1.   The Transport Coordination Ministers Conference (TCMC) was estab-
lished in January 1970 to coordinate and discuss transport plans and policies
at the ministerial level. TCMC consists of the Ministers of EPB, MOC, MOHA,
MOF, National Defense, MOCI, MOT and the Minister without Portfolio, and is
headed by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of EPB.
2.   The Transport Coordination Working Group (TCWG) was established in
September 1970 as an instrument of TCMC and is intended to provide liaison
and information from the ministries concerned at the working level. This
group also deals with monthly traffic allocation between rail and coastal
shipping.
3.   The Transport Planning Office (TPO) in MOT was organized in Decem-
ber 1969 for appropriate coordination of the transport sector and is desig-
nated as a permanent body to serve as secretariat of TCMC. MOC still retains
authority over planning for highways and ports.

FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Description of Railway Property
1.   Railway Lines
At the end of 1971, KNR operated 3,085 route-km of standard gauge
(1,435 m) and 125 km of narrow gauge (0.915 m) lines, mainly single track;
528 km are double track, including the main line from Seoul to Pu San (445 km)
and Seoul to In Cheon (39 km) (see Map). The narrow gauge line from Su Wt'on
to Yeo Ju was closed in April 1972. The double track main lines have gradients
not exceeding 1% and curves of 400 m minimum radius. There are many sections
in mountainous areas; over 40% of the network has gradient over 1%; there are
long sections of 2.5% and some of 3%. There are numerous curves, 134 km uf
tunnels and 97 km of bridges. Several of the bridges need strengthening,
which is planned.
The total length of track, excluding about 1,381 km of sidings, is
4,156 km, of which 2,061 km is laid in 50 kg/m rails, 1,694 kim in 37 kg/m
rails and the rest in lighter rails; 27% of the main line tracks (excludinc>
sidings) are under 10 years old and 11% more than 30 years. All renewal of
principal lines is now with 50 kg/m rails. Some 66 km of track on the Seou'-
Pu San line have welded rails and 80% of the track has hardwood ties; KNK,
however, has used prestressed concrete ties, manufactured in Korea, on about
20% of the principal lines. Most of the track is laid with 22 cm of ballast
but much ballast is round stone. Track is generally well maintained but KN.Y
has been devoting more attention to rail renewals on a programmed basis: co:-
sequently, ballast and tie replacements have slowed down during the last ts'
years.
The growth of traffic, especially on the double track main lines
and the industrial lines to the northeast of Seoul which carry large volumes
of heavy coal and cement traffic and are being electrified, and the use of
heavier diesel/electric locomotives necessitate a change in the maintenance
procedures adopted hitherto. KNR proposes to undertake complete renewal of
about 400 km of track as well as 355 km of rail during thie third Plan period.
The track maintenance system will also be reorganized in 1972 with the re-
ceipt of track maintenance equipment, financed under Credit 183-KO/Loan 669-KO.
Signalling arrangements consist of color lights in the Seoul area
and electric block instruments on most main lines. Centralized Traffic Con-
trol (CTC) has been installed on the single line of heaviest traffic between
Mang U (near Seoul) and Bong Yang (148 km).  Automatic block signalling has
been installed between Seoul and Dae Jeon (167 km) on the Seoul-Pu San
(Kyeong Pu) line, and extension to Pu San is planned.  A CTC system for thc
Seoul area is planned with German bilateral aid.  KNR has also introduceL
train radio equipment and the automatic train stopping system for safety ane
plans to extend their use.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
Major anthracite coal mines are located in the northeastern part of
Korea, where the major production of cement is also concentrated. The 350-km
single track railway lines connecting this mountainous area with Seoul carry
about 40% of KNR's freight traffic. Increasing traffic, especially coal and
cement due to planned developments in this area, necessitates a substantial
increase in line capacity. Electrification of 350 km of the three line sec-
tions involved ("Industrial Lines") was therefore included in KNR's second
Five-Year Plan investments. Work commenced in 1970/71 and is now in progress.
This electrification is now expected to be completed, in stages, by 1974.
2.   Motive Power and Rolling Stock
KNR's motive power and rolling stock position at the end of 1971 is
given in Table 2. The fleet consisted of 417 locomotives (80 steam, 337
diesel), 156 diesel railcars, 1,513 passenger cars, and 15,189 freight cars;
this includes 50 diesel locomotives received by KNR in mid-1971 and financed
under Credit 183-KO/Loan 669-KO. Only part of the freight cars financed
under the credit/loan were received- the rest will be delivered in 1972 and
1973. Steam locomotives (except for 7 for narrow gauge lines and 17 reserved
for emergency use) will be phased out by 1974. During the third Five-Year
Plan period, KNR will receive 66 electric locomotives for operation on the
electrified industrial lines.
About 400 of the 1,513 passenger cars are over--aged N;anchurian
Railways' or second-hand American Railways' cars and are in very poor condi-
tion. KNR plans to replace these cars during the third Five-Year Plan period.
About 17% of the freight cars are over 30 years old and many of
them need replacement. About 24% of the freight cars have a carrying capac-
ity of less than 30 tons. Shortage of freight cars has previously been a
problem in rail transportation in Korea; this eased with the delivery of
some freight cars financed under Credit 133-KO/Loan 669-KO.
3.   Telecommunications
Much of KNR's telecommunications network has reached the end of
its expected life, and modernization and development was included in KNR's
planned investments.  Consultants (Nippon Telecommunications Consulting Co.),
whose studies are financed under Credit 183-KO/Loan 669-KOG have formulated
detailed schemes, including installation of microwave and exchange equipment.
These works are now expected to be executed in 1972/1973, with financing,
under Credit 133-KO/Loan 669-KO.
4.   Marshalling Yards, Workshops and Other Property
Marshalling yard facilities are generally inadequate with relation
to the expanding traffic and the need to increase consolidated train load
operations. The requirements were reviewed by consultants (Touche Ross and
Co.), who recommended increased yard capacity in several locations and con-
struction of a new yard at Shi Heung with capacity to handle 1,500 cars.
KNR could not acquire land at this site and, instead. increased the capacity



ANNEX 4
Page 3
of some existing yards (Yong San, Seong Buk, Yeong Deung Po) and added a new
yard at Bu Gok. KNR's proposals for the third Five-Year Plan period 1972-1976
covered an additional capacity of 900 cars per day in the Seoul area (300 at
Bu Gok and 600 at In Cheon as part of a new In Cheon port line project), which
meant a total capacity in the Seoul area somewhat below the level envisaged
by consultants, but acceptable in view of the slower traffic growth than fore-
seen by them. KNR, however, later advised that the proposed In Cheon port line
project will not now be taken up, but the work will be limited to a connectiorn
of the new port with the Shin ileung area of the existing KNR network with yard
capacity for handling 120 cars daily. In view of this, the provision of sub-
stitute facilities for marshalling in the Seoul area was discussed during nego-
tiations and the Investment Plan revised suitably by the addition of yard facil-
ities at Su Saeg and KuK Su. An additional daily capacity of 350 freight cars
by end 1974 and about 550 cars by end 1975 has thus been planned for the Seoul
area. Marshalling yards other than those in the Seoul area are planned at
Je Cheon (to handle an additional 740 cars a day), Dae Jeon (to handle 800
cars a day), and Ul San (to handle 300 cars a day).
KNR presently has four main workshops: Seoul (Yong San) for heavy
maintenance of diesel rail cars, passenger coaches and freight cars; Yeong
Deung Po for heavy repairs of steam locomotives, passenger coaches and freight
cars; Pu San for heavy maintenance of diesel locomotives, passenger coaches
and freight cars; and In Cheon, which until mid-1971 was engaged in construc-
tion and rebuilding of passenger coaches and freight cars. Nearly 60% of the
workshop plant and equipment is over-aged and in need of replacement. With
growing traffic and the addition of electric locomotives (due to industrial
lines electrification) and of electric rail cars (due to Seoul suburban elec-
trification), workshop repair facilities need improvemient. Consultants
(Touche Ross & Co.), who made a study financed under Credit 183/669-KG recom-
mended the establishment of a new workshop at Dae Jeon with facilities for
repair of passenger coaches and freight cars and centralizecl repair of diesel
locomotives. In their report (1971), they envisaged the continuance of man-
ufacturing activities at In Cheon shop. Since mid-1971, however, KNR has
discontinued manufacture of rolling stock at the In Cheon shop and now intends
to utilize this shop for repair of diesel rail cars and passenger cars.
KNR proposes to reorganize the Seoul (Yong San) workshop to handle
repair of electric rail cars and electric locomotives. Pu San workshop is
to continue repair of passenger cars, freight cars and all the diesel loco-
motives. The old Yeong Deung Po workshop situated in the Seoul area is pro-
posed to be closed when steam traction is phased out by 1974; some of the
equipment in good condition is to be transferred to running sheds. It is
now planned to build a new workshop for freight car repair at Dae Jeon dur-
ing the third Five-Year Plan period. The facilities at In Cheon, Pa San
and Seoul are to be reorganized and improved with replacement of the over-
aged plant and equipment, The details of facilities at Seoul for electric
rail car repair are to be worked out by Japanese consultants employed in
connection with Seoul suburban electrification. It was agreed during negotia-
tions that these consultants would review the other facilities being planned
by KNR in the reorganized Seoul workshop, from the point of view of overall
coordination.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
In addition to the four workshops, KNR has 18 running sheds for the
light repair and inspection of steam and diesel locomotives, besides sheds
and sick line repair facilities for passenger cars and freight cars. The
question of concentration of locomotive repair shed facilities at fewer loca-
tions was discussed with KNR, especially with the phasing out of steam loco-
motives; KNR agreed to the facilities being concentrated at nine locations
and the others being eliminated. Non-scheduled repairs to diesel locomotives
now done at Pu Sanwill be transferred to the running sheds. Over 50% of the
plant and equipment at most of the running sheds is over-aged and needs re-
placement; this is now planned for the third Five-Year Plan period.
Maintenance procedures for diesel locomotives, diesel rail cars
and freight cars were studied by consultants (Touche Ross and Co.); their
recommendations have been generally accepted by KNR and are proposed to be
implemented.
In general, the buildings, stations, offices and general plant of
the railways are well maintained. However, some improvements are needed in
certain stations and yards; these are now planned.

KOREA
FOURTH RAILWAY PPOJECT
Tariff Structure
1.   Freight Rates
The present tariff structure is relatively simple to apply and
basically embodies the following practices:
(a) There are-separate rate tables for carload shipments (account-
ing for over 90% of all freight), carload shipments in privately
owned cars and less than carload shipments. Private car rates
were 65% of KNR carload rates and this was raised to 757 of KNR
carload rates in February 1972. Empty return of private cars
is billed at 50% of the class four rate for the tare weight of
the car.
(b) Each tvpe of traffic is based on five tariff classes.
(c) Tariffs are entirely straight line in direct proportion to
distance travelled, with the following exceptions:
(1) There is a 3,460 Won minimum charge (to help cover
basic non-distance related costs; it also introduces
a slight "de facto" distance taper into the rate
structure).
(2)  Carload charges are billed at a minimum carload weia,ht
which is usually equivalent to the practical capacitv
of the car for the particular commodity density.
(3) A small switching charge is made for everv deliverv or
pickup, and for one or more cars to or from a custorer's
private siding.
(4) Demurrage is charged on cars after thle first five hourrs
of free time.
(d)  Rates are quoted in increments for each block of S0 kilom,eters.
The main items in each class and the carload rates app1ii-11a- ftror
May 1969 up to January 1972 and fror February 1972 are given belcmr:



ANNEX 6
Page 2
Rate in Won per ton for each 50 km
May 1969      February 1972
Class 1 - Gasoline, cattle, textiles,
clothing, furniture, meat and
dangerous goods (which have a
10% extra charge)                      121.30            133.0
Class 2 - Sugar, cotton, plywood, hard-
board, tobacco                           98.00           113.0
Class 3 - Cement, diesel and bunker oils,
fruits and vegetables                   80.75             97.0
Class 4 - Lumber, rice, grains, salt, fer-
tilizer, limestone, ore, pulp,
asphalt, bricks                         66.30             83.0
Class 5 - Coal                                     57.65             73.00
The freight traffic structure provides little taper.  A review of this ind
of commodity classification with reference to costs would be required to im-
prove the tariff structure.
2.   Passenger Fares
There were three classes of passenger fares prior to December 1969.
Since the last few days of 1969, the distinction between classes of service
has been abolished with the adoption of a single class of kilometrage rares,
while revised surcharges have been retained for special services sucli s  x
press trains, seat reservations and sleeper accommodation. In addiLiU. Lo
these fares, there is a "transportation tax' of 10%' reimbursable by vJR  tw
Government.  The minimum tariff is 30 Won.  The normal passenger Lariff is
based on a charge of 1.65 Won per kin excluding the tax and 1.815 .Jon inc.lI_--
ing the tax. The surcharges (excluding tax) are as follows:
Express Surcharges - Minimum rate for distances up to 200 kin; twice the
minimum rate between 201 and 400 kn; maximum rate  DL
distances in excess of 401 km.
Tourist train (Kwang Gwang Ho)                  200 - 800 Won
Special express (limited)                       150 - 600 Won
Ordinary express                                100 - 300 Won

tion, and the Shin Heung Area is planned and is expected to be completed in
1973. A short extension (8 kmn) of Jeong Seon Line in the Tae Baeg coal mine
area, and the industrial sidings for U1 San and Po Hang industrial complexes
are carried over from the second Plan and are expected to be completed in
1973.
2.   Electrification (19.2% of total expenditure)
(a) Industrial Lines Electrification
In order to increase the traffic capacity on the sinFle-track in-
dustrial lines (Jung Ang Line, 155.2 kin; Tae Baeg Line, 107.0 km; and Yeong
Dong Line, 85.S km; total, 348.6 km), serving the coal mines and cerent
factories which are concentrated in the northeastern part of Korpa, electri-
fication started in 1970/71, and a major part of the worl is carried out in
this Plan period. The worlk includes ground facilities such as suhstations,
overhead wire, modification of signalling and telecommunications equipment,
and a 13-km railway connection including a 4.5-k.m tunnel, whicch will. shorten
the hauling distance between east and west by about 50 km. The electric
traction is exnected to commence in part by end 1P72 and to he comnleted by
end 1974.
(b) Seoul Suburban Area Electrification
This is part of the Seoul metropolitan rapid transit systf; aimed
not onlv toward easinp commuter traffic congestion in and around the Seoul
area during rush hours but also toward helping accelerate the urbann develop-
ment in the Seoul-In Cheon-Su Weon triangle.  While Seoul City constructs a
9.5-km subway between the Seoul central station and Cheong Ryane pi, FKN
electrifies the existing railway lines and links them withi the subwav.  The
work is expected to he completed by end 1073 or early 1974.  Upor conp]etio',
six-railcar trains will operate through without chpange from KPF lines to th(
Seoul subway and vice-versa, with a minimum headw7av of five minutes.  fort
details are given in Annex 8.

3.   Capacity Increase in Stations and Lines (13.2% of total expenditure)
(a) Seoul Area
The construction of two freight centers at Yong San and Seong buk
to improve the freight handling facilities in the Seoul area was started
under the second Plan and is expected to be completed in 1974.
(b) Marshalling Yards
In order to catch up with increased incoming and outgoing freight
cars in and around the Seoul area, a marshalling yard at Bu Gok, -34 km south
of Seoul, continues to be extended in the Plan period and is expected to be
completed in 1973. Provision of yard facilities at Su Saeg and KuK Su to
handle 455 freight cars daily is also now included in the Plan. Other thian
the Seoul area, two marshalling yards at Je Cheon, Ul San and Dae Jeon are
expected to be completed over the Plan period.
(c) Signalling
This includes the Seoul CTC system, which was originally planned
for smooth operation of long-distance passenger trains in the second Plan
period and is now enlarged to cope with the frequent operations of electric
railcar trains due to Seoul suburban area electrification. An extension of
automatic block signalling on Kyeong Pu Line (Seoul-Pu San) beyond Dae Jeon
to Pu San is now included in the Plan to improve the line capacity andl also
to ensure the safety of dense train movements. Both works are expectedi to be
completed by end 1974.  In addition, on the important lines, an enlarcement
of the automatic train stopping system, an extension of the tokenless block
system, and level crossing improvements are included under this item over
the Plan period in order to ensure safe train operations.
(d)  Double Tracking of Ho Nam Line
An 89-km double tracking was originally planned and 23 km t'  CoiUl-
pleted at the end of the second Plan.  Taking account of recent develocp-wL_ts
in the area, the completion of only another 25-km section. on which earthwork
is already in process, is now envisaged; the balance is being deferred.
(e) Station Building, Station Yard Extension and Vvass Lines
This mainly covers provision of platform sheds for passeng,ers -in,
freight storage sheds at some important stations to providie better servi-<.
The station yard extension and bypass line construction are li:.ited to so:e
major junctions on the main lines.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
(f) Installation of Crossing Loop
Emphasis is placed on sections such as the Jung Ang Line between
Yeon Ju and Gyeong Ju and the Dong Hae Nam Bu Line between Po lIang and Pu San,
in order that the capacity on these sections may be improved to handle the
likely increase in bulk freight traffic.
(g) Lengthening of Crossing Loop
This is being planned at stations on the main lines to enable haul-
ing of longer freight trains by the diesel locomotives recently received
under Credit 183-KO/Loan 669-KO.
4.   Way and Structure (12.9% of total expenditure)
(a) Complete Track Renewal and Rail Renewal
Of a total of 4,156 kml of track length, about 1,600 kI, consisting
of the most important lines such as the Kyeong Pu Line, the Seoul suburban
area lines, and industrial lines (the latter two sets of lines are to be
electrified in the Plan period) require a change in the maintenance practice
so far adopted by KNR. Accordingly, complete track renewal of 400-km track
length is envisaged over the Plan period to replace old track with new welded
50 kg/m rails, prestressed concrete sleepers and crushed stone ballast. Rail
renewal of 355 km, and some replenishment of ballast, is separately planned,
generally covering the other main lines. Released rails from complete track
renewal and rail renewal are stepped down to branch lines and sidings.
(b) Equipment for Track Maintenance
This includes track maintenance equipment, financed under Credit 183-KG/
Loan 669-KG and due to be delivered by mid 1972; one passenger-car-typE, track
inspection car; and some track equipment, including not only portal cranes and
heavy tamners, typical of track renewal on the double track section. but also
hand-held tampers suited to track renewal on the single track section. Thle
track equinment is expected to be delivered by end 1973.
(c) Point and Crossing Improvement
Tn order to shorten the travel time of passengers on the Kyeong Pu
Line and some other important lines, point and crossing improvement is planned
and is exnected to be completed by end 1974.
(d)  Bridge Strengthening
Of 15,732 m of bridge spans, 4,628  m is planned to be replaced over
the Plan period to ensure the safety of train runs and to rem,ove train speed
restrictions in some cases. This work is planned to be carried out on certain
bridges on the K'yeong Pu Line. (Seoul-Pu San), the industrial lines, and the
Seoul suburban (electrification) lines, which carry a great nortion of the
traffic of KNl, as well as on some other lines. Also included is bridge
girder erection equipment.

quickly as possible in case of a train accident. a replacement of five in-
efficient steam-driven breakdown cranes is planned and expected to be deliv-
ered by end 1973.
(f) Other
In order to improve the availability of Cliesel locomotives and
diesel railcars, a replacement of components is planned1 and expected to be
completed by end 1974.  Improvement to some passenger cars by installing
electric generators to provide better service is also included.
6.   Motive Power and Rolling Stock Repair Facilities (2.7/G of total
expenditure)
In order to reorganize motive power and rolling stock nainteu,cince
procedures and to increase work efficiency in accoruance with the recorllmentila-
tions made by the consultants, improvement to existin,.; running slheds andi

FOURTHl RAILWAY PROJECT
Seoul Suburban Electrification
1.   Background
The rapid economic growth of Korea has brought about major changes
in the industrial structure of the country and an urban shift of the popula-
tion. The capital city of Seoul, around which a great deal of economic activ-
ity is concentrated, has grown rapidly (doubled in ten years) and has a pres-
ent population of 5.5 million (more than one-sixth of the country's popula-
tion). The population is expected to grow to about 7.5 million by 1981.
The present transport system consists mainly of bus and taxi trans-
port, and 70% of the city's traffic is concentrated in the central business
district, covering an area of 5.5 sq kin. Congestion is already acute and im-
mediate measures are needed to alleviate the worsening traffic situation.
The number of persons travelling to the central business district
in one day exceeds one million, of which 0.6 million are commuters going to
their place of work or school. This number is rising.
For the metropolitan area as a whole, a subcity center plan and a
comprehensive land use plan have been worked out in an attempt to decentral-
ize city functions; a promising residential district has been planned for
the area south of the Han river. These areas need linking with the central
business district.
A project has been drawn up by Japanese consultants who carried
out a study of the problems involved. The objective of this project is to
facilitate an amicable development of the metropolitan area as well as to
eliminate traffic congestion, and to decentralize the urban population into
the suburbs by the construction of a metropolitan rapid transit network with-
in the Seoul metropolitan area.
2.   Outline of the Project
The project provides for the construction in the city of Seoul of
rapid transit subway, line No. 1, Seoul and Cheong Ryang Ri, and the electri-
fication of the existing Korean National Railroad lines within the Seoul metro-
politan area. The rapid transit subway, line No. 1, chosen as the first pri-
ority project of the planned five lines, will be connected to the Korean Na-
tional Railroad at Seoul and Cheong Ryang Ri stations to provide through op-
eration on these surface railroad lines to be electrified. The scope of work
is as follows:

Kyeong Pu line (Seoul-Su Weon)                              41.5 km
Kyeong In line (Seoul-In Cheon)                             38.9 km
Kyeong Weon line (Yong San-Cheong Ryang Ri-Seong Buk)   18.2 km
Total            98.6 km
(2)  Subway (Seoul Station-Cheong Ryang Ri station)               9.5 km
The gauge of track of the subway will be 1.435 mm (4 ft. 8-1/2"), conforming
to that of KNR's surface system. The electric system for the subway will be
of the DC type, (1,500 V) and, for the electrification of KNR, will be AC 25
KV 60HZ. Substation facilities on KNR will be provided at Yong San. Auto-
matic block system by means of five aspect wayside signals, coupled with CTC
system, is to be installed to ensure the safety and smooth running of trains.
Telecommunication facilities to be provided include shielding all cables in
the sections electrified and prevention of telecommunication line induction
in adjacent wire. On the Kyeong Pu and Kyeong In lines, the stations will
have ticket checking facilities on both sides; the existing stations, plat-
forms and other passenger facilities will be improved. One hundred and
twenty-six (126) electric railcars to be adapted for dual AC-DC operation
will be acquired for KNR and 60 for the subway portion (to be owned by Seoul
City). ITe electric railcars will be put into through operations from KNR
lines to the Seoul subway and vice-versa, with a six-railcar train formation
in a headway of five minutes on the section from Yeong Deung Po through the
subway to Cheong Pyang Ri, and 10 to 15 minutes on the three KNR suburban
lines during rush hours. A car shed for KNR's electric railcars is planned
at Gu Ro. The heavy repair of electric railcars will be done at Seoul work-
shop of KNR, which is to be reorganized. Seoul City is planning separate
facilities for electric car repairs and signal control in consideration of
the expansion of the subway in the future.
The estimated costs of KNR electrification and the time-phasing of
expenditure are shown on the following page:

KNR is undertaking the construction work in regard to its electri-
fication project and Seoul City is undertaking the work in regard to the sub-
way. The two organizations have set un coordinating bodies. The Ministry of
Transport and the Economic Planning Board also play an active role in the
coordination and implementation of the whole project.  A loan of Yen 27.24
billion (US$88.44 million eauivalent) has been extended to the Government of
Korea by the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), Japan. Of this,
Yen 15.42 billion (TUS$50.07 million equivalent) has been allocated to K-P.
and the balance (Yen 11.32 billion or TTSS38.38 million enuivalent) to Seoul
City. The loan from Japan to the Government carries interest at 4,.125,' per
annum, with repayment in 20 years, including five years of grace. Government
has relent the proceeds of the loan to KNR and Seoul Citv at 5% per annum
with repayment in 20 years, including five years of grace. The loan finances
goods and services required for the project and obtained fror. Japan, excent
that Yen 9.24 billion (of whicli KNP's portion is Yen 4.62 billion, USS15.0
million equivalent) can be used for local currency financing under a pre-
scribed procedure.
Consultants from Japan have been provided under the loan to assist
in the implementation and comDletion of the project. The electrification of
KNR suburban lines is expected to be completed bv end Decemher 1973 and elec-
tric train operation is exnecte(d from 174.

FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Economic Return Calculations
1.   Electrification of the Industrial Lines
Table 1 of this Annex shows the calculations of a typical economic
return on the above-mentioned component of the Plan. Economic benefits in
the form of transport cost savings are generated by avoiding diversions of
the bulk rail traffic (from northeast of the country to the Seoul-In Cheon
area) to coastal shipping at higher cost, by shortening the hauling distance
(some 50 kIn), and by replacing diesel traction with electric traction. The
investment costs provide for (a) construction of ground facilities, (b) pro-
curement of electric locomotives, and (c) associated investments including
increases in line capacity, track renewals and a new signalling system.
Within the analysis, the economic costs of various means of transport have
been based on the financial costs. The major variables involved in calcula-
ting the economic benefits are (a) the economic costs of rail operation by
both diesel and electric traction, (b) the economic cost of alternative
transport by coastal shipping including transshipment costs, and (c) the
volume and anticipated rate of growth of traffic on the relevant KNR lines
and, consequently, the volumes of traffic which would have to be diverted
from the railways because of present capacity limitations. The estimated
economic return would, therefore, vary, depending upon alternative assump-
tions for major variables in the analysis.  Assuming that the economic cost
of the investment would be higher by 10% (taking into account the possible
over-valued Won currency in terms of dollars), and, at the same time, the
incremental transport cost of coastal shipping traffic diverted from KiR
would be lower by 5%, the economic return would be about 17%. If, as is
quite like]y, traffic volumes materialize faster than estimated and oper-
ating costs of electric traction are lower than diesel traction, the eco-
nomic return would be substantially higher than the 20% shown in Table 1
of this Annex. The particular economic return calculations in Table 1 do
not include the possible benefits accruing to passenger traffic, e.g.,
time savings and increase in comfort. To this extent, the economic return
is understated.
2.   Seoul Suburban Electrification
Table 2 of this Annex shows the calculations of a typical economic
return on electrification of the Seoul Suburban area of KNR. Economic bene-
fits in the form of transport cost savings are generated by the substitution
of rapid mass transit passenger trains for the presently used bus and taxi
transportation. The investment costs cover (a) the construction of ground



ANNEX 9
Page 2
facilities, (b) purchase of electric rail cars, and (c) associated invest-
ments such as repair and maintenance facilities required for item (b).  Eco-
nomic costs of operating suburban lines are based on the financial data pro-
vided by KNR; economic costs of operating buses and taxis are based on data
provided by EPB. The major variables involved in quantifying economic bene-
fits are economic costs of various means of passenger transport and the
volumes of passenger traffic expected to divert to suburban railway services
(given the pricing policies for various modes of transport).  The estimated
economic return would, therefore, vary, depending on alternative assumptions
for major variables in the analysis. Assuming that the economic cost of the
investment would be higher by 10%, and that the incremental transport cost
saving would be lower by 5%, the economic return would be about 16%.  If the
diversion of passenger traffic from buses and taxis to suburban lines is
larger than conservatively estimated, and if the incremental transport unit
cost savings are higher, the economic return would be substantially higher
than 20%, which is shown in Table 2 of this Annex.
3.   Other Investment Items
Other investment items cover track renewals and bridge strengthen-
ing, track equipment, signalling and telecommunications, purchase of freight
cars and passenger cars, improvement of workshop and sheds, and some yard
and line facilities, all of which have not been included in the economic
analysis for electrification of the industrial lines and of the Seoul Subur-
ban lines. Table 3 of this Annex shows the calculation of a typical economic
return on these items. Economic benefits in the form of transport cost sav-
ings are generated by improving KNR's operating efficiency, and increasing
KNR's capacity, thereby avoiding diversion of traffic to other modes, parti-
cularly road transport, at higher cost. KNR's costs are based on operating
expenditures, including depreciation, but excluding those operating expendi-
tures associated with the industrial and the suburban lines. Transport costs
of other modes, expressway buses and trucks, are based on EPB estimates. The
freight and passenger traffic forecast in Tables 4 and 5 in the text of the
report is based on the implementation of the investment program, excluding
traffic gereration related to the industrial and suburban electrification.

ANNEX 10

KOREA
-        FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Principal Assumptions - Financial Forecasts
The financial projections are based on the following principal
assumptions:
1.   The freight and passenger traffic forecasts (Tables 4 and 5).
2.   Increases of 3% per annum in material prices; no increase in
staff remuneration levels during 1973 and 1975 and increase
in such levels by 10% per annum during 1974 and 1976.
3.   Reduction in staff strength by 1% in 1973 and no increase in
staff strength thereafter. Reduction in fuel and maintenance
costs on account of modernization and improvements covered
by the Investment Plan.
4.   Tariff adjustments of February 1972 taken into account - pas-
senger and freight revenues shown in Table 17 are at 1972 tariff
levels. Additional revenue to be secured by tariff adjustments
is shown separately for each year. These revenues could be
raised by freight tariff adjustments (on a selective basis) to
yield an average increase of 20% each from January 1974 and
January 1976; passenger and freight tariff increases from
January 1975 adequate to provide additional revenues equal to
that of 20% passenger tariff increase. If staff costs and
prices increase beyond the annual increases referred to in 2
above, further adjustments would be made to compensate the
higher costs to the extent such costs cannot be offset by lower
expenses or greater traffic than included in the forecasts.
5.   Results of revaluation of fixed assets not anticipated.
6.   Foreign exchange rate of USS1 = 400 Won for debt service and
investment.
7.   Terms already finalized in regard to the amount allocated to
KNR from the Special Yen Credit extended by Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (OECF - Japan) to Korea, the terms of the loan
from the consortium of European manufacturers in regard to the
electrification of the industrial lines, and other existing
debts; new KFW loan of about Deutsche Mark 13 million with 2%
per annum rate of interest and 25 years repayment including
five years grace; Government loans to KNR of 5.2 billion Won
in 1972, 6.36 billion Won in 1973 and 5.2 billion Won during
1974 with interest at 6% and repayment in 20 years including
five years' grace.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
8.   The proposed IBRD loan to be US$40 million equivalent with an
interest rate of 7.25% per annum and repayment in 25 years,
including a four-year grace period.
9.   Foreign exchange requirements for 1975 and 1976, amounting to
US$24.3 million equivalent to be arranged from international
sources, with interest at 7.25% per annum and repayment in 25
years, with a four-year grace period.
