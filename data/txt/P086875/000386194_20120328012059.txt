1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      This Implementation Completion Results Report covers the implementation of a
series of two programmatic Development Policy Loans supporting Namibia’s Education
and Training Sector Improvement Program.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2.      The centrality of education, skills development and competitiveness for the
economic growth of Namibia has been long acknowledged by the Government of the
Republic of Namibia and remains central in the policies for national development of the
country. The World Bank started supporting analytical work in the education sector in
Namibia to identify the key bottlenecks in skills formation for competitiveness of the
economy in the early 2000s. The Government of the Republic of Namibia formulated the
Education and Training Sector Improvement Program (ETSIP) with the support of the
World Bank and other Development Partners with the aim to strengthen the quality,
efficiency and effectiveness of the education and training system. ETSIP provided the
platform for comprehensive institutional and policy actions in the education and training
sector.

Background
3.       Government policies and programs aiming at including previously disadvantaged
citizens in Namibia’s economic activities seemed to have a certain degree of success.
Income inequality declined: between 1993/94 and 2003/04 the proportion of poor
households1 declined from 38 to 28 percent, and the extremely poor households2 declined
from 9 to 4 percent. Income per capita increased from US$ 2,370 (2005 est.) to
US$ 3,861 estimated in 2008.3 However, the income share held by the highest quintile
was 78.7 percent, relative to 1.4 percent for the lowest quintile (2007 est.).4 Poverty was
more pervasive in the rural northern and north eastern regions which held 52 percent of
households, 60 percent of the population, and a high proportion of female-headed
households (which tend to be worst off in terms of food poverty) (NHIES 2003-04). A
sign of deteriorating poverty was the decline in Human Development Index from 0.734 in
1966 to 0.607 in 2004, partially because of the fall in life expectancy at birth from 61 in
1991 to 41 in 2005. Also, worrisome was the high youth (aged 15 to 19) unemployment
rate, estimated to be 64.6 percent in 2004.

4.     In 1998 the then President of Namibia instructed the Cabinet to propose a long-
term vision for the country’s development. The review process of the performance of the
main sectors of the economy led to the formulation of Vision 2030, which set up a
framework for long-term development. The vision of the country was one of a knowledge

based society, creating new technologies as driven by a responsive and flexible general
education and training system, supported by enabling regulatory and institutional
framework.

5.       To be able to encourage the development and application of Knowledge and
Information (K&I) technologies the country needed to raise the quality of middle and
high level skilled labor. The training system needed to be flexible, sustained by an
equitable general education system of good quality and efficiency. But the productivity
growth of the country was still hampered by an acute shortage of skilled workers at
various levels of training. Namibia’s education, training and skills development sector
was not able to produce the right quality of skilled and technical labor required to
facilitate knowledge- and technology intensive production. Key impediments included
poor quality, internal and external inefficiency, inequality in the distribution of education
inputs, and limited access to secondary and vocational education.

6.      The Ministry of Education requested Bank assistance in carrying out the basic
analytical work required to define a) the areas where the education system was failing to
respond to the priority actions necessary to meet the socio-economic objectives of the
Vision 2030, b) the main education issues negatively affecting the education system per
se, and c) the remedial measures to be taken. To address key education sector weaknesses
identified in the analysis, the Government developed a 15-year Strategic Plan for
Education and Training Sector Improvement Program (SP-ETSIP 2005-2020) to be
implemented in three 5-year programs (ETSIP1, 2, 3). ETSIP was developed with
substantial Bank technical support and in collaboration with 13 international DPs. A
MoU signed on June 28, 2007 outlined the partnership framework. The World Bank was
instrumental in bringing together the DPs. As early as 2005, the MoE had requested the
World Bank and the UN to convene a fund raising roundtable for the ETSIP where the
DPs were invited. Therefore, Bank technical support managed to leverage a total of
US$ 406.9 million external program funding —US$ 371.9 million in grants and US$ 35
million in loans, of which US$ 15 million was from IBRD in the form of DPL1 and
DPL2.

7.       ETSIP1 was launched in 2006 with the global objectives of i) strengthening
quality, effectiveness and efficiency of the system, ii) strengthening the immediate supply
of middle to high level skilled labor and, iii) strengthening the policy, legal and
institutional set up of the system.

8.      IBRD financing was delivered through two single-tranche DPLs of US$ 7.5
million each, totaling US$ 15 million for a program whose total cost was estimated as
US$ 488 million. The first DPL was approved on May 24, 2007, and the second on
November 18, 2008. DPL1 was the first lending instrument to Namibia in support of the
first implementation phase of the GRN’s sector reform program (ETSIP 1).

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)




                                             2
9.     The DPL1 supported the development of: (i) specific policies and policy
instruments to guide and give effect to planned sector reforms; (ii) legal instruments to
enforce policy implementation; and (iii) institutional capacities required for effective
implementation of planned sector reforms.

10.     DPL2 supported the three pillars of ETSIP1 by reinforcing DPL1 efforts to
develop: (i) specific policies, legal and financing frameworks that underpin planned
sector reforms; (ii) specific systems and tools required to give effect to policies, legal and
funding frameworks intended to improve education access, equity, quality, relevance and
efficiency; (iii) specific institutional capacities that are critical for effective
implementation of planned sector reforms.

11.     The single tranche annual series of 2 DPLs supported the above mentioned key
objectives of ETSIP1. A large number of indicators were identified as outcome/output
indicators. These are given in Appendix A. Table 2 (section 2.1 below) gives the progress
achieved during the DPL period for some of the key indicators.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

12.    The PDOs were not revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

13.   Though the ETSIP1 program was subdivided into subprograms for ease of
implementation, DPL1 and DPL2 supported the three pillars of ETSIP1 by targeting five
main policy areas that were cross cutting across the sub-programs:

  i.   Equitable expansion of access to post-basic education and training

14.     The sector improvement program, ETSIP1 planned to prioritize supply of middle-
to high-level skilled labor by expanding access to post-basic education and training. A
particular focus was underserved and poor regions of the country. This was planned
through more efficient use of existing systems of secondary education by increasing class
size to a more optimal level (no more than 35 students per class), better organized
scheduling, and extending good performing senior secondary schools. Construction of
new senior secondary schools was also planned by the government. The preparation of
DPL2 included a plan for stepping up the expansion of senior secondary school and VET
places. In addition a quota system for allocating new places for children from low income
households was piloted.

 ii.   Improving education quality, and equity of learning outcomes

15.     The main objective under this policy was to improve the education quality and
effectiveness. The government planned specific actions at various levels of the sector.
This included revision of curricula to facilitate holistic development, articulation of



                                              3
competencies at various levels for adequate learner readiness, teacher pre-service and in-
service training, improved assessment tools, performance targets for schools and school
management, and competency-based education and training for vocational education and
training.

 iii.   Eradicating inequalities in the distribution of resources

16.     The overall policy outlook of ETSIP1 was pro-poor. The main objective under
this policy area was to support pro-poor expansion to access to education at all levels,
through input norms for all schools and VTCs, normative per capita financing for schools
plus conditional grants to schools that do not meet the norms; in addition, through
provision of adult education and training programs for currently neglected areas, as well
as conditional grants for orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs).

 iv.    Improving efficiency in resource mobilization and utilization

17.    The aim was to improve efficiency of resources allocated by improving quality
(reduce internal inefficiency) and by improving learner-teacher ratio, restructuring of
teacher salaries and implementation of staffing norms in all institutions.

  v.    Strengthening institutional and management capacity (also described as
        strengthening delivery capacity and the sector’s response to HIV/AIDS in DPL2
        Project Document)

18.     Strengthening delivery capacity and management in education is one of the key
policy objectives in ETSP1. The DPLs aimed to support comprehensive assessment of
capacity including lower levels of service delivery. It also aimed to support the
establishment of critical institutions vital for implementing the ETSIP1.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

19.     Policy areas were not revised.

1.6 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

20.     MOE decided to extend the duration of Phase 1 of ETSIP by two years to align it
to the National Development Plan 3 timeframe and to the funding cycle of Development
Partners.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

21.    Implementation of the DPL series was adversely affected by delayed
disbursement of the second DPL. The first DPL was signed and disbursed per the
schedule defined during project preparation. For the second DPL, however, there was a
23 month delay prior to the signing of the loan agreement. Some apparent reasons for this


                                            4
include concerns by the Government of the Republic of Namibia regarding the negative
pledge clause which is a standard condition of all IBRD loan agreements. The borrower
wanted to better understand the implications of the negative pledge clause for Namibia.
Secondly, legal and procurement issues delayed and ultimately prevented reaching
agreement on a fee-based service agreement (FBSA) between the Government of the
Republic of Namibia and the World Bank which was intended to be a part of the Bank’s
engagement in the sector along with the DPL. The issues around the FBSA were raised
during negotiations of the second DPL and continued to be discussed between the GRN
and the World Bank until signing of the loan. For Namibia as a country borrowing for the
first time from the World Bank, lack of familiarity with World Bank operational
procedures appears to have contributed to misunderstandings and perhaps a lack of trust.
At the same time, the lack of a permanent World Bank presence in Namibia made it more
difficult to resolve misunderstandings that arose during the period. Consequently, over a
period of 23 months a number of meetings were held between the officials from Namibia
the World Bank Education team and the legal team from the World Bank. Eventually, an
internal agreement was reached within the Government of the Republic of Namibia upon
which the legal agreement was signed on Sept. 17, 2010. While Government
implementation of ETSIP continued throughout this period, in the absence of the FBSA
the Bank team was not able to provide the expected level of technical support for ETSIP
implementation.

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)

22.     Overall the ETSIP1 program which was supported by the two DPLs from the
World Bank along with 13 donor partners and the Government of the Republic of
Namibia has achieved some moderate progress. The achievements are more evident in i)
adoption of new policies, ii) creation of new bodies, to rationalize sectors and improve
their efficiencies, iii) curricula development, to introduce new subjects and take into
account new educational learning profiles, iv) training activities, in view of the revised
curricula, to comply with the needs to upgrade the knowledge level of school
administrators, teachers and supervisors, and to raise awareness on some important topics,
v) studies, leading to new actions, improved external efficiency, and better assessment of
existing programs and, vi) provision of teaching/learning materials, advocacy materials,
construction of schools, and various equipment. When looking at the progress across sub-
sectors in the program from 2006 to 2011, some attained most of their objectives (e.g.
ECD/PPE), some others lagged behind (e.g. CD). Achievements addressed, in various
measures, quality and access, but seem to have had a lesser impact on equity and
efficiency.

23.    In terms of the specific policy areas under ETSIP1 that were supported by the two
DPLs, significant progress was seen during the first DPL. In particular, the first DPL and
the analytical work that preceded it developed a strong momentum around the need for
reforms. Within the first year of the DPL a number of policy reforms and cabinet
approvals had already been initiated. These included cabinet approvals for policy to




                                            5
introduce grade 5 and 7 standardized diagnostic tests5, sector specific ICT policy, sector
specific HIV/AIDS policy, VET bill and legislation on the National Council for Higher
Education. Improvements in enrolments in VET institutions as well as Grade 11 intake
were seen as well.

24.     The prior actions and triggers for DPL2 were completed on time as well.
Additionally, some progress was also seen on the equity of provision of education and
training. Almost 60% of the new secondary school places were created in the
disadvantaged regions, enrollment in VET was increased for the students from the 7
disadvantaged regions of the country and the country had started a process for
introducing per capita financing for both equity and efficiency in the education system.
Private schools were being provided subsidies based on a separate formula worked out
for private schools. However, for public schools, the formula was approved but has not
yet been implemented.

25.     During the 23 months period when the loan was approved by the World Bank
Board of Governors and the signing of the loan, progress in ETSIP1 continued with GRN
funding and support of some development partners and contributions from the Namibian
private sector.

26.     As mentioned above, in some areas of reforms the progress was much faster than
in others. But the pace of the reform, overall, appears to have reduced slightly compared
to the first year of the DPL. However, this can be attributed to the fact that the period of
the first DPL was associated with introduction of new policies legislations and bills and
with cabinet and Parliament approvals of these. Since the political will was strong at the
time, these policies were formulated and adopted relatively quickly. The implementation
process however, took much longer than anticipated. This might also be attributed to the
non operationalization of systems meant to bring about expected quality and equity
changes.

27.    Details of the progress made under each pillar are given below:

Policy Area 1: Equitable expansion of access to post-basic education and training



                                               7
28.     The equity issues in post basic education enrollment had started to be addressed
very early in the life of the DPL series. During the first year of the program a total of 100
new classrooms and one secondary school were constructed, thereby significantly
increasing new places for students. Based on the action plan adopted under DPL1, the
government ensured that 60% of all new places were created in 7 most disadvantaged
regions of the country. The number of orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) enrolled
in secondary education increased. As of 2010, 22.4% of all students in grade 1-12 were
OVCs.

29.     The quota system for allocation of new places to children of low income
households was piloted in 2008. For now this is operating as a public-private partnership
process. The private schools receive subsidies from the government, provided they have
at least 10% of their total enrollment as OVCs. These schools face a penalty if OVC
enrollment is less than 10%. However, there is no systematic monitoring of the condition.
Certain private institutions provide scholarships to low income household children.
Additionally, quota system for distributing Grade 11 places has also been introduced and
is in place. However, it has been felt that the relocating of students in such cases
sometimes creates extra financial burden for the low income families.

30.     To increase access to enrollment in vocational training centers (VTC), the MoE
had planned to “buy? 2000 training places per year. However, this intervention did not
take place due to lack of funding. At the same time, construction of 4 Community Skills
Development Centers (COSDECs) was delayed. Construction of the COSDECs is now
underway, with support from Millennium Challenge Account (MCA).6

31.     An important action intended under the DPL was the attempt to boost quality
output in science, mathematics and ICT. The establishment of six secondary magnet
(vision) schools in the poorest regions of the country was hoped to help attain this goal.
This action was delayed substantially, first to establish the feasibility of such an
investment. The construction of one such magnet school (now called Vision schools) has
started in the Kavango region and is expected to be completed in 2013. The reason given
for only one school being built was lack of funding. Also, the concept has evolved over
time suggesting that some existing schools could become vision schools. MOE has
indicated it will take over funding of any future vision schools which suggests that no
further funding from ETSIP will be needed.

32.     In order to improve student readiness at entry, tertiary pre-entry programs were to
be started for ICT, science and mathematics. The initial target was 50 students in each
program. The enrollment was already at 100 students by the end of DPL1. These are
offered by Namibia College of Open Learning in two campuses: Windhoek and Oshakati
(Oshana).

                                                    8
33.    A number of actions were envisioned under this policy area for all subsectors of
the education system.

34.     A major achievement under this area is the policy to introduce standardized
assessment tests for grade 5 and grade 7 (initially proposed for grade 8).7 This has been
fully achieved and implemented, where the assessment for grade 5 has been completed
and for grade 7 was undertaken in 2010. It is planned that the testing will be done for
each grade in alternate years. A specific division under the Directorate of National
Assessments and Examination has been created that is responsible for these assessments.

35.     The Government of the Republic of Namibia started re-orienting the education
and training towards a competency based system under ETSIP1. The National Institute
for Educational Development (NIED) defined competencies that reflect school readiness
for pre-primary education; lower and upper primary curriculum was revised on a similar
basis and the new curriculum was approved by the National Examination Assessment
Certification Board; and secondary education curriculum was also revised.

36.     Competency Based Education and Training (CBET) was also introduced in
Vocational Training Centers. The Zambesi VTC was the first to introduce this approach.
The learners and trainers found it difficult to understand the concept of CBET and held
strikes to resist the implementation. However, the National Training Authority (NTA)
held a number of meetings to clarify the value of such an approach and now the model is
operating smoothly.

37.    A number of other actions were also taken under this pillar. These include,
approval of ICT specific policy; provision of ICT equipment to 245 schools, 5 VTCs, 4
colleges of Education, 23 Teacher Resource Centers, 29 libraries and community centers
and 13 COSDECS; mainstreaming of ICT in grade 8-12 mathematics, science and
English curricula; and classroom support for the ICT teachers. All these measures have
been aimed at improving the learning of students at various levels of education.

38.     For Early Childhood Development (ECD), a policy was approved by the cabinet
in March 2008. ECD curriculum has been developed, and training of ECD staff was
undertaken, with exposure to international experiences including Malaysia and South
Africa. One shortcoming, though, has been the delay in development of the Namibian
Holistic Index of Child Development. And being dependent on the HICD, establishment
of the system of competences and professional standards for ECD is still pending. Key
reason for this is the lack of consensus of what constitutes the HICD.

39.    An important action under the pillar was the phased increase of 5% of the budget
share for books and instructional materials relative to teacher salaries. The action was

    This activity was to a large extent supported by USAID




                                                      9
adopted in 2006, however, the target of 5% has still not been reached and remains at
1.3% for primary education. At the secondary education level, the target is much closer to
being achieved at 3.1% in 2009/2010.

40.     The government under the Vocational Training Act (discussed in policy area 4
below) introduced a number of actions to improve the quality of technical and vocational
education which included both the improvement in facilities and equipment as well as
instructor training.

41.      Despite these actions for improving the quality of education, the results appear to
be disappointing. The grade 8 repetition rate in 2010 has increased slightly over the 2008
rate at 26.4%. Similarly, the repetition rate for grade 1 and 5 remain much higher than the
proposed targets (Table 2). The issue of quality of education remains a concern to both
the Development Partners as well as the Minister of Education. Although, with a rapid
increase in enrollment in upper grades, the average quality is expected to reduce given
the enrollment of the more marginalized students, it was however, anticipated that the
comprehensive nature of ETSIP will counter any such problem

Policy Area 3: Eradication of inequalities in distribution of education resource inputs

42.    Some of the actions mentioned under the preceding two pillars also contribute
towards the objectives of this pillar. Additionally, introduction of pro-poor pre-primary
education has been attempted with first 100 pre-primary classrooms being started in the
underprivileged regions.

43.    A school register of needs is being established under the program to monitor the
supply of inputs in the schools – though the process has been stalled for some time. Once
developed, it will be used to establish the norms of school inputs. This activity has not been
completed given its dependence on the school register of needs.

44.     There is one action that has not been implemented yet, that is the per capita funding
formula for primary and secondary education. At the time of DPL1 the government had
agreed to apply a new formula and initiated the necessary analytical work. At present
difficulties arise in choosing a formula mainly due to the population data that are a decade
old. Also, the calculation of unit costs is not finalized yet. There are also some issues of
compensation to regions and the per-capita funding formula has not been adopted but not
yet implemented.

45.    For FY 2009/2010 the recurrent budget has been transferred to the regions
excluding the funds for salaries, which will be still paid centrally. In terms of capital budget
a per capita formula is in use for two components namely maintenance and nationwide
renovation (of schools and hostels).

46.    Similarly, the funding formula for Vocational Education and Training (VET) has
not been revised yet and the old system, which appears to be flawed, is still being used. For
both VET and TET funding formulas, analytical work is underway, but the decision



                                              10
making process is taking longer than anticipated. A payroll levy for firms and industries to
contribute to the cost of training is being developed as well. The design is well advanced
and will be introduced soon. Sector Skills Committees are aware of and in agreement with
the concept of a training levy for cost sharing.

Policy Area 4: Improved efficiency in resource mobilization and utilization

47.    Government of the Republic of Namibia invested approximately 9% of GDP in
education till the early 2000s. The proportion of spending on education was reduced
gradually and reached 6.7% during mid-2000s. Given the push for expansion of post-
secondary education and training the allocation was again increased and it stood at almost
8% in 2008. Additionally, the support from the DPs for ETSIP also increased. However,
the aim has been to reduce education expenditure once the basic infrastructure and other
key inputs have been made. The current total education expenditure stands at 8.7% of
GDP.8

48.    Improving learner-teacher ratio was planned to improve efficiency in the system.
The MoE had to hold discussions with the teachers union to be able to agree on a higher
LTR. However, the current value suggests that the learner teacher ratio has actually
decreased over time. It is not clear whether this is a result of pressure from the teacher
unions or not.

49.     Similarly, the attempts to reduce grade 8 repetition rates and grade 10 push out rates
did not bear fruit, and the current values are even higher than the base values at 26.4 and
32.6 percent respectively (Table 2). These results reflect the inability of the reforms to
improve the standards for the lowest performers, and the internal efficiency of the system
remains low.

50.     In terms of standardized assessments to monitor quality of education, percentage of
learners attaining D grade or better both in grade 10 and 12 examination for Mathematics,
Science and English improved over time as did the regional assessment SAQMEQ results
(Table 2 gives targets and achievements of the key outcome indicators).

Policy Area 5: Strengthening delivery capacity and the sector’s response to HIV/AIDS

51.    In order to tackle the challenge of HIV/AIDS in the education sector, HIV/AIDs
Management Unit (HAMU) was set up in the Ministry of Education. In addition, Regional
AIDS Committees for Education were strengthened and supported. Through HAMU, the
mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS issues was intended to be addressed in all areas of the
education system, including the curriculum, teacher training, learning materials and
management competencies. Though progress in life skills studies, teacher training and
OVCs access to education is seen, the progress is hard to quantify due to a lack of proper

                                                11
monitoring under HAMUs. This indicates lack of proper monitoring and evaluation
structures.

52.     In terms of strengthening service delivery for the various subsectors as one of the
objectives of this policy area, progress and achievements have been mixed. A number of
policies and Bills were passed to create an institutional setup for smooth achievement of the
main objectives under ETSIP. For instance, pre-primary education was taken away from
Ministry of Gender Equity and Child Welfare and placed under the Ministry of Education.
National Counsel for Higher Education (NCHE) was established and a National Training
Authority was set up.

53.      The establishment of the various agencies/authorities did not jump start the process
of change and rapid progress. As new entities, the evolution and establishment of the
operational structures of these took a lot more time than anticipated. For instance, it took
almost 3 years to appoint the CEO for the NTA. Throughout, this period, the NTA was
understaffed and absence of the CEO meant that no decisions on staffing could take place.
Similarly, for the NCHE, the Strategic Plan for HEIs was prepared by TA, but was
considered unsatisfactory. So now, a new consultant is to be recruited for the process.
NCHE is also preparing an amendment to the NCHE Bill in view of transforming the
Council into an independent body (thus receiving funds directly from Parliament). In terms
of capacity building for the NCHE, the preparation of guidelines for staff development is
still pending.

54.     Within the Ministry of Education, a draft organizational restructuring plan entailing
required staff and resources has been developed and the draft is going through the review
process. Decisions are still pending, in particular as this links to the overall decentralization
policy of the GRN.

55.     Many other capacity development activities were envisaged for the MoE staff, but
were not completed. For instance, as an initial step, assessment of the system’s capacity to
implement reforms was planned but not undertaken; a capacity development program was
not articulated; strengthening of procurement and financial management capacity did not
take place; the core ETSIP team was intended to be trained in Integrated Financial
Management and Information Systems (IFMIS) which did not take place; and the training
of the management staff in effective leadership was not conducted.

56.    Consequently, the capacity development area of ETSIP1 supported by the two
DPLs was not successfully implemented which had negative consequences on the overall
performance of the program.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

57.     The ETSIP1 program has been a flagship of the Ministry of Education in Namibia
supported by 13 development partners (DPs) including the World Bank. As such, it has
proved to be sustainable over time. This report identified certain shortcomings in the
implementation of the program that could be attributed to the non-provision of certain
expertise associated with the activities under DPL2. It appears that the construction of the
magnet schools and the capacity development component of the program were negatively
affected by the absence of the World Bank. The capacity development subprogram, that
should have been a cross-cutting program, was not developed as such. The DPL2 clearly
supported CD as one of the policy areas and it is highly likely that it would have been
pushed forward had the loan been signed on time. The lack of expertise to implement the
CD sub-program also negatively impacted the implementation of the program as a whole.

58.    In the general two key factors affected implementation and the achievement of
some outputs of ETSIP1: a) frequent changes in the coordination and management of the
program and, b) the absence of a structured M&E system at both the central level of the

 The original indicator was percentage of OVCs who successfully complete senior secondary education.
MoE informed the ICR mission that this number is not collected. The individual performance of OVCs is
not followed.



                                                  13
MOE and within the sub-programs. We discuss the issue of implementation here and
M&E in section 2.3 below.

59.     The overall coordination of ETSIP was initially entrusted to the Undersecretary of
Non Formal Education. The Undersecretary adopted a tight management approach, with
strict monitoring of the implementation plans drawn by the managers of the sub-programs.
This approach was deemed necessary for a timely start of a complex program like ETSIP.
In December 2008 the Undersecretary left his post. Between that date and June 2009 the
program was coordinated by the Deputy PS on an interim basis.

60.     In June 2009 the Undersecretary of Formal Education was appointed the new
coordinator. The new coordinator adopted more of a decentralized approach to program
management where responsibilities were shifted to the coordinators of the various sub-
programs. Probably this move reflected the emerging education decentralization policy
being adopted by the MOE. However, in retrospect, it appears that the program was not
ready for the shift in management style. Some management issues already present in the
structure were exacerbated. Issues emerged in areas such as planning, program
monitoring, overall management, and budgeting/funding. More specifically (i) sub-
programs managers did not receive clear TOR concerning their responsibilities, authority
and expected outputs; (ii) no internal regular review of the program was conducted; (iii)
sub-programs were considered as separate: regular meetings between sub-programs
managers were not held which would have helped in discussing common issues and
overall implementation of ETSIP.

61.    The presence of the World Bank technical assistance during this period might
have helped alleviate some of these issues since the World Bank loan had been designed
to support policy areas which cut across the subsectors, in particular supporting capacity
development. A regular presence of the Bank technical expertise for implementation
support missions, during the second and third year of implementation of ETSIP might
have encouraged cross-sub-program dialogue.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

62.      The implementation structure originally conceived under ETSIP and supported by
the DPLs was appropriate. The coordinator of the program had a proper authoritative
position in the Ministry of Education to coordinate activities within the Ministry and
liaise with outside stakeholders including other Ministries and DPs. However, during
initial years of ETSIP1 the M&E function was generally disregarded. MOE did not set up
a formal structure, no structure existed at the regional level, and the managers of the sub-
programs did not set up a structure for their area of activities. As a result, process and
implementation monitoring has been weak. The EMIS did not include certain indicators
required by sub-programs such as ECD and HIV/AIDS. The sub-programs did not set up
their own internal indicators because of non-existent internal M&E structure despite
being envisaged under the program. As such, the evaluation of certain outcomes could
not take place (such as the effectiveness of teachers’ in-service training programs, and the
assessment of education achievements as a result of changes in curricula). The absence of



                                            14
a M&E system and structure is an important flaw in the ETSIP program and is currently
being highlighted in the mid-term review of ETSIP1.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

63.     ETSIP1 is ongoing. During an implementation support for DPL2, the World Bank
team was requested by the Minister of Education to conduct a mid-term review of the
ETSIP1 and recommend concrete suggestions for the way forward. The World Bank
invited the DPs mainly, EU, MCC, UNICEF and UNESCO, to be a partner in this
exercise given the key role played by them in ETSIP1. The mid-term review has recently
been completed and discussed with the MoE. Related findings of the review are also
reflected in this ICR. The World Bank team has seen interest from the MoE in engaging
their technical assistance in moving ETSIP1 forward, but the modalities of this
engagement have not been defined. Given the issues in the last DPL series, the team has
decided support short and targeted TA if requested (such as leading the mid-term review
process as mentioned above).

64.    Here it needs to be mentioned that the PD for DPL2 mentions that “Beyond the
DPLs, the Bank support will be sustained through a fee-for-service arrangement in the
amount of US$ 2 million to be used over the program duration as reflected in a MOU?.
An Agreement for Advisory Services was drafted in 2008 10, but the agreement was not
signed because the Government objected to: a) the clause of paragraph 8 stating that all
the documents produced under the agreement could not be widely distributed without the
consent of the World Bank, b) the requirement that all services and consultants were to be
exempted from local taxes and, c) the fact that it was not to participate in the selection of
consultants.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

65.     A number of positive outcomes have been achieved, for instance, important
policy measures have been adopted, new bodies have been created that will allow an
expansion of the supply of relevantly trained post-secondary graduates, curricula have
been revised, ICT has been incorporated into general education, VET and teacher
development curricula is developed, the system’s response to HIV/AIDS is being
strengthened.

66.     But there have been some shortcomings as well. Due to the non performance of
capacity development activities, the objective of improving capacity at central and
decentralized levels, and the functional review of MOE to take into account the ongoing
decentralization process, have not taken place, despite urgent needs. Also, the key
objective of improving internal efficiency in general education has not seen the
anticipated results.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

67.     The objectives of the ETSIP program, which is was supported by the two DPLs,
were and still are very relevant to the needs of the Namibian economy. The essence of
ETSIP 1 was to contribute to the attainment of the national objectives contained in the
Vision 2030 and in the National Development Plans, and to address the main weaknesses
of the education system.

68.      Mid-term review of the ETSIP1 program was recently completed by the DPs and
the MoE. The strategic objectives of the initial ETSIP were still endorsed and still remain
relevant; thus indicating the relevance of the DPLs to the current country and global
priorities. However, it was indicated that till now ETSIP1 had given lower priority to
laying the foundations of the system. Thus, a slight change in strategic direction for the
government moving forward is the increased emphasis on primary and secondary
education and monitoring and evaluation of the system.

69.     The Development Policy Operation covered all sectors from ECD to tertiary
education. This is appropriate for a policy operation. A large number of outcome/output
indicators were identified in the policy matrix as the result indicators. The DPL1 Project
Document provides as a policy matrix with Outcome/Output Indicators for the base year
and for the years 2007/08 and 2008/09. The DPL2 Project Document includes an
expanded Policy Matrix providing target indicators for the years 2006/07, 2007/08 and
2012/13.

70.      A number of the indicators used for the DPL policy matrix appear to have been
created specifically to monitor the effect of certain policies. Some information was
initially collected and progress was reported in the annual review meetings. However,
follow-up proved impossible because once it was understood what the indicators actually
meant, it was realized that the indicators cannot be collected the way originally planned
on paper. Thus the follow-up on these indicators for DPL2 and eventually for the ICR
after a 2 year gap proved impossible as no government official was able to provide
information on those specific indicators.

71.      The implementation structure supported by the DPLs, as originally conceived,
was appropriate. The coordinator/manager of the program belonged to the high
hierarchical structure of the Ministry, thus had proper authority to coordinate activities
within MOE, and to liaise with other ministries, DPs and the Bank. Also, each sub-
program had a designated manager, reporting to the program coordinator for all matters
relating to ETSIP. The central idea in designing the implementation structure was to
avoid the creation of a structure additional to the existing one within MOE. Various MOE
departments/units (such as Planning and Administration, General Services, Accounting)
were to collaborate in project implementation, by assuming responsibility for specific
activities. This collaborative approach to implementation was a sound one, and was in
line with Bank directives.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives


                                                16
72.    The key development objectives of the DPLs were (i) specific policies and policy
instruments to guide and give effect to planned sector reforms; (ii) legal instruments to
enforce policy implementation; and (iii) institutional capacities required for effective
implementation of planned sector reforms.

73.     As discussed in detail in section 2.1 above, the World Bank support in the initial
period of the program was instrumental in supporting specific policies and policy
instruments to guide the reforms. The presence of 13 DPs and MoU signed between the
DPs with GRN to support ETSIP1 gave a strong signal of the importance of these
reforms to the government. As a result the political will was strong and a number of
policies and legal instruments were either signed or approved without much delay.
Therefore objectives 1 and 2 appear to have been achieved to a satisfactory extent,
despite delay in adoption of a few policies, such as the VET Act among others. This is
reflected in Table 2 above.

74.      With regards to the third objective, the achievement is more mixed. The
development of institutional capacity was planned at various levels. Some of these
activities did take place, for instance, procurement staff were trained, but the full extent
of the planned CD activities did not materialize. Although complete attribution is not
possible due to nature of the lending instrument used by the World Bank to support
ETSIP, it is likely the absence of the World Bank as an active DP for almost 2 years
could have contributed to this. Most of the capacity building components in ETSIP were
strongly supported by the World Bank and could have been impacted by the loss of a key
supporter of these activities.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.     The program performance has been good in certain areas, for instance, rapid
progress was seen in policy areas 1 and 3. Policies, acts and cabinet decisions were made
to support pro-poor expansion of post-basic education, both for general secondary as well
as TVET education. The number of learners enrolled at senior secondary level increased,
the enrollment rate for OVCs increased, programs for improving quality of education at
pre-tertiary entry level were introduced and implemented, curriculum was revised at all
levels to make it a competency based approach and pre-primary education was extended
in the previously disadvantaged regions of the country. But certain actions under policy
areas 2, 4 and 5 did not quite achieve the desired outcomes. This includes the failure to
reduce repetition rates at various levels of school, though the achievement in SACMEQ
improved over time. One major shortcoming is the delay in CD programs.

76.    In spite of the absence of specific PDO indicators, the assessment of
achievements is established on strong evidence based on the benchmarks and indicators
which are in-built in the DPLs. Data shows that 83% (65 out of 78) of the main activities
supported under the DPLs were completed, the overall outcome rating is justified as
Moderately Satisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

77.      The two DPLs have supported pro-poor reforms and activities, but the impact on
equity issues has been moderate. The expansion of ECD/PPE, the expansion of access to
secondary education (giving priority to under-represented regions), and of
VTC/COSDEC facilities, the provision of incentives to teachers in remote areas (intended
to increase their retention), the equitable distribution of textbooks with an increased
textbook/learner ratio, the quota system for distributing G11 places, intended for students
from low income families, the quota system for allocating places to low income children,
the approval of the Education Sector Policy for OVCs are some of the most important
activities of ETSIP that have had some positive impact on poverty, but challenges remain.
The DPLs focused on OVCs by assisting the creation of an Education Development Fund
(EDF) at secondary level for OVCs, on setting up conditional grants for OVCs, and an
OVC register. However, in terms of follow-up and impact, the EDF is no longer
operational and the debate is around abolishing users’ fee in education. The OVC register
has not been successfully used for orientation of policy or planning. Thus, though the
OVCs are gaining access to ECD, pre-primary, and secondary education, the overall
improvement in access is moderate at best.




                                               20
78.    In Namibia there is no gender disparity in enrollments: in primary education ratio
of boys and girls is equal, and at secondary level females are over-represented. Thus, the
DPLs did not focus on gender issues in terms of access to education services.

79.    In terms of equity and resource allocations, great disparities still exist among
regions: rural schools receive fewer resources than urban schools, have higher
percentage of unqualified teachers (particularly teachers not trained in the subject they
are supposed to teach), and have lower representation indexes relating to enrollment.11
Also the school feeding program (not supported by the DPLs) does not reach the poorest
children, mainly due to their remote locations. Not enough attention was paid by the two
DPLs on substantive actions to address regional inequalities (in terms of quality inputs
and adequate financing), apart from the support provided to expand access to secondary
education (though not comprehensively) and to vocational education.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

80.    The DPLs have sown the seeds for institutional strengthening. Following
achievements of Phase 1, all supported by the DPLs, will result in positive institutional
changes and/or strengthening:
       The assignment of performance targets for each school, resulting in better
       management and quality outputs,
       The devolution of authority to VTCs, together with the new organizational
       structure and conditions of service for VTCs, resulting in an improved, more
       efficient management of these institutions.
       The creation of the NCHE which is expected to improve the relationships between
       the tertiary sector and the labor market (external efficiency)
       The study on a functional structure of the MOE, taking into account the
       decentralization, and the MTR proposal to initiate a capacity development
       program at both central and decentralized levels, if at least initiated during the
       remaining two years of Phase 1 implementation, will have a noticeable and
       sustained positive impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of the MOE.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

81.    Many of the achievements of the first five years of ETSIP 1, supported by the
DPLs, as described in the previous sections of this report, are still fragile:
i)     Some actions are not yet totally embedded in the MoE overall conceptual
       approach to developing its activities. This includes the absence of an HIV/AIDS


11
     EU. PER, August 2011



                                                21
           consciousness within MoE in terms of its negative impact on the education
           system; the limited attention paid to adequately developing the knowledge and
           innovation sub-program as an important element to reach the Vision 2030 goal of
           a knowledge-based economy.
ii)        Some actions need continuous follow-up actions to be effective. For instance,
           policies that need action plans to be fully implemented, training programs that
           need an assessment of their efficiency.
iii)       Certain activities have been initiated but risk not being fully completed in the
           absence of complementary actions. For instance pro-poor expansion of access
           cannot be completed in the absence of a school mapping exercise; eventual
           increase in the number of VTCs and COSDECs need a proper study of regional
           characteristics and local labor market needs.

82.        Thus the risks to future development outcomes arise from:
i)         The lack of education planning knowledge at all administrative levels in the
           MoE which handicaps a balanced development of education services.
ii)        The lack of proper monitoring and evaluation system and tools, 12 which
           makes it difficult to properly assess the efficiency of certain activities (such as
           teacher training, curriculum development), and to monitor the delivery of the right
           outcomes.
iii)       The absence of monitoring effectiveness of expenditures among the sub-
           programs, to ensure that the original allocations were made in accordance with
           education priorities, and funds were disbursed following the agreed priorities.
           This issue derives from the absence of M&E and, partially, from the lack of
           planning capacity.
iv)        The still existing disparities among regions in funds allocation. It is expected
           that the new funding formula presently under discussion will address the issue of
           equitable distribution of resources. This will be a step towards pro-poor delivery
           of education services, though eradication of inequalities will take longer to
           resolve.

83.     Despite the risks mentioned above, a moderate rating is justified by the fact
that a number of positive actions have been taken in the last few months. The current
Minister of Education is keen to understand the shortcomings and risks associated with
the development outcomes and had requested a Medium Term Review of ETSIP 1. The
MTR suggests concrete measures to address the above risks, mainly to be taken during
the remaining phase of ETSIP 1. Most of these measures have been endorsed by the
government as well, thus reducing the risk level. For instance, the introduction of
implementation plans of certain cross-cutting sub-programs such as HIV/AIDs education
and Capacity Development together with the other sub-programs receiving inputs; and
the introduction of a new sub-program on Monitoring and Evaluation.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

     M&E was an output contained in the activities supported by the DPLs, but was not delivered



                                                     22
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84.    The quality at entry of the project is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The World
Bank did a thorough review of the sector prior to the DPL series. The Bank team was
proactively involved in supporting the MoE with the design of the ETSIP program and
the expected outcomes. Preparation activities were also very intense, timely, and involved
MoE staff of various departments. The program was ambitious and up to the standard of a
middle income country education system.

85.    The partnership with the government suffered at the beginning from a negative
perception of the Bank among government staff and other stakeholders. This perception
changed when the MoE, started to appreciate the high quality technical support provided
by the Bank missions. At the time of appraisal, disagreements on some elements of the
program’s content (e. g. HIV/AIDS, CD) were finally resolved.

86.     A Quality Enhancement Review was held on January 25, 2007 and was asked five
main questions concerning the appropriateness of: i) a DPL operation, ii) the proposed
triggers, iii) the government’s funding of Bank policy and technical support, iv) the
overall implementation arrangements and, v) relevance, feasibility and technical
soundness of the government’s overall program. The review panel: a) endorsed the DPL
instrument, b) expressed concern at the number of policy and action measures listed in
the program document, c) advised the team to prepare detailed TOR identifying the
support expected by the Bank following the Government’s agreement to provide funding
for US$ 2 million to cover the Bank’s costs of providing policy and technical advice
during and after the implementation of ETSIP 1, d) suggested that a list of detailed sector
performance indicators be developed to be reviewed at the annual meeting in September,
and e) considered ETSIP to be relevant, coherent and appropriate in the context of the
country’s education status. As a result of the panel’s recommendations the team included
in the Project Document (PD) of DPL1 as Annex 3 a policy matrix providing
Outcome/Output Indicators for the base year and for the years 2007/08 and 2008/09. The
Project Document for DPL2 included an expanded Policy Matrix providing target
indicators for the years 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2012/13.

87.     In hindsight, two issues might have improved the quality at entry. First, the Bank
team did not identify key PDO indicators. This shortcoming has however been partly
overcome by the introduction of a long list of detailed sector indicators. However, the
indicators that were introduced were not the usual ones adopted by the education sector
or collected under the EMIS of the country.

88.     Another aspect that could have improved the overall outcomes, and relates to
quality at entry is when preparing the DPL the policy dialogue with key policy makers
outside of the education sector was not fostered. Although the various key ministries


                                              23
were invited in all stakeholders meetings and discussions, some chose not to be a part of
the process. The World Bank team did not see this as a potential problem when preparing
the DPLs. However, this created a sense of unease across key ministries. Perhaps, a lack
of complete buy-in for the DPL series from the Ministry of Finance might have been a
contributing cause of the delay in signature of the second DPL.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

89.     The first Bank assistance mission, as requested by the Government, took place
during the period April 26 to May 14, 2004. Seven additional missions followed, until the
Joint Appraisal mission that took place October 1 to 17, 2006. All the donors involved in
ETSIP participated in discussions on the presentations of the sub-programs made by
various MOE officials.

90.    After effectiveness (12/20/2007), the Bank sent one implementation assistance
mission in March-April, 2008. The Aide Memoire of the mission mentioned under
paragraph 2.2 that:
       In future, Bank missions will focus on the technical support required to resolve
       implementation issues that the MOE team could not resolve on its own, and
       In addition, future Bank teams will provide training in areas identified by the
       MOE team as critical for their capacity development.

91.    There was no follow-up on these actions. The preparation for DPL2 took
precedence.

92.     After the delay in signature of the loan documents, the World Bank sector team
did not conduct many in country missions. The focus of discussions at the time was
clarification of the issues surrounding the negative pledge clause in the loan agreement
and the FBSA as mentioned in section 2 above. Thus the related missions that visited
Namibia during this period, and the discussion held, also via audio and video conferences,
revolved around the resolution of the legal issues. Therefore the policy support for ETSIP
from the World Bank was unable to take precedence. There is also some possibility that
the involvement of the World Bank in policy dialogue in Namibia during the period of
Oct. 2008 – Sept. 2010 suffered because of staff turnover during the latter half of 2009.
The absence of a World Bank office in Namibia and a permanent presence on the ground
also appear to be amongst the main reasons for contributing to the misunderstandings
with the client country.

93.    The World Bank participated in the Development Partner’s meeting with the MoE
and the new Education Minister in Nov. 2010. The final implementation support mission
went to Namibia after signature of the second DPL in Feb. 2011. The mission monitored
the progress of the various activities envisaged under DPL2. The mission was specifically
asked by the Minister of Education to lead a review of ETSIP1. Upon this request, the




                                           24
World Bank agreed to lead a mid-term review of ETSIP1 with the support of all DPs and
identify the way forward for the program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

94.     Attribution is always difficult in a Development Policy Operation. In this
particular DPL, the delay in signature of the second loan of the series and the presence of
a number of other supporting DPs makes the attribution of results even more difficult.
However, based on the reading of relevant communications staring from 2003 to the
signing of the first DPL, it is the view of the ICR mission that the World Bank played an
integral role in the design and development of the policies adopted under ETSIP. The
Bank helped ETSIP gain momentum which has been sustained by the DPs and the MoE.

95.     The rating is based on the good performance in the up-stream activities leading to
the approval of the operations. The technical support from the World Bank has been
publically praised by the GRN. Some issues in the quality of entry, such as wider
consensus across key ministries around the DPLs impacted the quality of the final
product. Concerted efforts were put in by the World Bank in trying to resolve the issues
that were causing a delay of the signature of the second DPL, including attempts to
address the concerns of the GRN on the loan agreements as well as laying out the option
of cancelling the second DPL without any subsequent implication for the Government of
the Republic of Namibia. This delay did, however, impact the sectoral dialogue on policy
implementation issues with the government during the period that the second loan was
not signed thus justifying a rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

NOTE: The government and the implementation agency are the same so the rating
and performance are given together below.

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

96.     The government’s performance is rated as moderately satisfactory on the basis of
its mixed performance in achievement of PDOs.

97.      As detailed in section 2.1 (Program Performance) and 3.2 (Achievement of
Program Development Objectives), the government performed very well in certain
activities. The MoE performed well in adopting the main policies to be developed under
the two DPLs, and in areas such as the introduction of standardized tests, curricula
revisions, the adoption of standards in IALL, TET, VET and ECD/PPE, the construction
of new secondary schools with priority to disadvantaged areas, and the financial
assistance for OVCs entering the education system. Similarly VET Act was promulgated;
the NTA Board was appointed; five Industrial Sector Councils (ISCs) have been
established and three are functioning; a legal framework for devolution to VTCs was
prepared. These are significant achievements given the short period of time.


                                            25
98.     There were however, a number of delays and certain targets were not achieved –
the most important of which were the improvement of quality of education. More
specifically, the MoE failed to (a) analyze the causes of repetition and drop out, important
for taking corrective measures to improve efficiency (b) define and adopt the NHICD for
pre-school children, delaying the definition of proper inputs for this age group, (c) set up
a proper M&E system and structure, (d) develop the planned activities included in the CD
sub-program (e) give proper attention to the cross-cutting significant activities of sub-
programs such as CD and HIV/AIDS.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

99.     Since the implementing agency and the Borrower are the same, the same rating
applies to both and is the same as discussed in (a) above.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

100. The ICRR guidelines (Appendix A) identify nine criteria for rating government
performance.
       The government had a complete ownership of the ETSIP program and was and
       has remained committed to achieving the development objectives of the program
       supported by the DPLs.
       The enabling environment for the program was conducive to the achievement of
       the objectives.
       Although key staff were appointed, the Ministry of Education in its totality was
       not ready for implementation of such a complex and large program without
       extensive implementation support.
       Implementation issues were not highlighted and resolved in a timely manner thus
       leading to a delay in certain activities in the program.
       Fiduciary requirements were met satisfactorily.
       There was good coordination between the various DPs based on the MoU signed.
       Monitoring and evaluation structures were not well established.

101. Based on this, satisfactory rating is attributed to ownership of the program,
willingness to create an enabling environment, fiduciary requirements, and coordination
of DPs. However, the implementation capacity and delay in introduction of capacity
development programs slowed the progress and overall a Moderately Satisfactory rating
deems appropriate.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

102. Complex program design: Programs/projects with many components are always
difficult for the country to implement, particularly when the operation is the first in the


                                               26
sector. ETSIP included activities aiming at improving all levels and sectors of education,
from early child education to the tertiary level, from adult education and lifelong learning
to vocational training. ETSIP was the first program of this magnitude, supported by DPs,
to be implemented by the MoE. It put a strain on the ministry’s staff and resulted in
delays in implementation. It also led to a loss of unified direction in trying to attain the
set objectives. The Bank should avoid supporting complex operations when they are the
first such experience for the country. A leaner first operation, setting the appropriate base,
can be followed by a more ambitious one.

103. Stakeholder engagement: When engaging in a country with little, or no,
experience in dealing with the Bank, sufficient, time should be spent in ensuring that all
stakeholders understand and agree on what the proposed cooperation entails (in terms of
processes, mutual responsibilities and obligations, and financial support conditionalities).
This responsibility lies not only on the sectoral TTL, but also on the wider country team
who has better access to important relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Finance and
Ministries of Planning and Economic Development. In the specific case of Namibia, the
permanent presence of the World Bank in Namibia in the form of an office can also help
the clients understand the modalities of operations of the Bank. Such a presence helps
foster relationships with the wider government (rather than sectoral links) and helps
clarify misunderstandings as they arise.

104. The lack of prior analysis of the implementation capacity of MOE was a
noticeable hindrance to a smooth execution of the program activities. The design of the
program did not take in sufficient consideration the execution capacity of the
implementers. It also did not into account the time necessary for the government to adopt
important policy measures. The capacity development sub-program was a late add-on in
the preparation process, and was never considered by the MOE as the basic element for a
successful implementation. In such complex operations the Bank should carry out a prior
analysis of the implementation capacity of the institutions involved, and an assessment of
the bureaucratic procedures for producing certain outputs, and give high priority to the
development of the required skills and basic procedures. The development of the required
capacities should have had an upstream preeminent position in the implementation plan
of the program.

105. Project development objective indicators need to be specified so that the key
indicators can be followed up over time. Additionally, if new indicators are introduced to
measure the impact of specific interventions, it should be ensured that the relevant unit in
the Ministry is fully conversant with the techniques of collecting those indicators.
Regular follow-up by the implementation support missions, specifically on proper data
collection and analysis is integral for efficient monitoring.

106. Continuous implementation support: There should be continuity in assisting
the implementation of programs/projects. Long gaps in the timing of assistance inputs
cause slow-downs in execution, and the risk of distortions in the attainment of
intermediate objectives and outputs as compared to the original ones. Fully staffed
missions are not always required: the visit of a single person, with the specific skills to



                                             27
address key issues, is sufficient enough to provide valuable inputs when required and, in
general, is appreciated by the implementers.

107. Considerations for working with development partners: Mobilization of
development partners around a program is not the end goal of partnerships but a
continuous fostering of relationships and transparent interactions is integral for the
success and efficiency of the program.

Implementation Completion Report for DPO in support of ETSIP1

Background
In October 2002, Cabinet by Decision 26th/15.10.02/0003 authorised the Ministry of Higher
Education, Vocational Training, Science and Technology to co-ordinate a study on Human
Capital Development and Knowledge Management for Economic Growth and Equity. The
World Bank was invited to undertake a critical analysis of the sector and to advise the
government how to best improve the sector and transform it into a better tool for supporting
national development. The study was conducted mainly in response to the Presidential call on
all sectors of the economy to effectively contribute to the realization of national development
goals and to the actualization of Vision 2030.
Three National Consultative Forums were held. The First Consultative Forum was held
during 29-30 January 2003 and set the scope for study, its methodology and time-frame. The
Second Forum, held during 22-23 May 2003, examined the key findings of the study;
corrected misinterpretations and pointed out critical omissions. The Third Forum was held on
21-22 August, 2003. This Forum focused on deciding on how best Namibia could apply the
findings and recommendations of the Study. The study was thus conducted through a
consultative process.

The analysis pointed towards the need for a comprehensive reform, notwithstanding the
substantive gains and progress made by the sector during the period after independence. The
reform was geared towards the improvement of quality and effectiveness, internal efficiency,
relevance and responsiveness and redressing the lingering inequalities.

In April 2004 the report on the study was discussed to identify and articulate key components
of an improvement programme. A draft strategic framework was then developed jointly by
World Bank experts and a Namibian task force. This framework used a comprehensive
sector-wide approach, taking as point of departure the already existing plans and programmes
of the sector Ministries. As an improvement programme it responded to critical, new and
emerging challenges facing the sector.

An intensive planning process ensued with World Bank technical support, resulting, in
February 2005, in the adoption by Cabinet of the fifteen-year Strategic Plan for ETSIP,
Planning for a Learning Nation. The Strategic Plan was endorsed by Namibia’s development
partners and stakeholders in education and training during the Round Table meeting held in
March 2005.


                                              37
It was agreed that ETSIP would be implemented in three five-year phases. The first, from
2006 – 2011, coincided with the Third National Development Plan (NDP3). It was further
decided that the programme would be divided into sub-programmes and work commenced on
the development of detailed 5-year implementation plans. The strategic plans and costed first
drafts of the 5-year plans were discussed with various stakeholders, including regional offices
of education, teachers, members of school managements, the teachers’ unions, members of
regional governance and educational fora in all 13 regions to ensure ownership and
collaboration. Comments were incorporated as far as possible.

The development process was spearheaded by the ETSIP Task Team which consisted of
representatives of all the line ministries in the education and training sector, the Ministry of
Finance and the National Planning Commission. This team was replaced by the ETSIP
Programme Coordinating Committee, under the chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary of
the Ministry of Education, in July 2006 after limited implementation of the programme
commenced utilising government funding.

In the development of the 15-year strategic plan, five main strategic objectives were
identified:
            Quality/effectiveness
            Equity and Access
            Development relevance and Responsiveness
            Delivery Capacity and Management
            Efficiency of resource mobilisation and utilisation.
The set of strategic objectives is common across the sub-programmes, but each sub-
programme has determined its own order of priority.

In addition to these objectives, a set of strategic objectives for the first phase of ETSIP were
determined. These are as follows:
           strengthening the supply of middle to high level skilled labour
           improving the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of general education
           systematising knowledge and innovation
           Improving the effectiveness and relevance of the tertiary education system, and
           strengthening the policy and legal framework for access to lifelong learning.

These strategic objectives were pursued through nine Sub-programmes, for Early Childhood
Development and Pre-Primary Education, General Education, Vocational Education and
Training, Tertiary Education and Training, Knowledge Creation and Innovation, Information
Adult and Lifelong Learning, HIV and AIDS, ICTs, and Capacity Development. While the
first six sub-programmes focussed on specific areas in the education and training sector, the
last three covered cross-cutting issues. This made of ETSIP a truly sector-wide approach.

A simulation model was developed as part of the development of ETSIP to estimate global
resource requirements for the implementation of ETSIP, to identify resource gaps and to
investigate savings which could accrue from the different policy choices.

The sector developed an Expenditure Issues Paper which clearly indicated, amongst others,
that available funds to the sector had decreased in real terms and that spending trends had
become increasingly skewed towards non-discretionary items such as personnel spending. It
was clear that, in order to implement the new activities and the priorities identified as
envisaged under ETSIP, critical policy decisions would need to be made regarding core
sector policies such as the full implementation of the staffing norms, the introduction of wage
restraint to contain wage bill increases (which goes across the public sector), and the
                                              38
introduction of learner unit costs based on the number of learners per region to redress the
inequities in resource allocation.

A fund raising round table meeting for ETSIP was held on April 19 and 20, 2006. This was
followed by a positive joint DPs' pre-appraisal of ETSIP in March 2006 which concluded that
the proposed programme was adequate to provide a balanced sector development and that it
was consistent with its strategic objectives and sub-objectives. A joint appraisal was
conducted by Development Partners' (DPs) in October 2006. However, in June 2006 the
GRN decided to commence with the implementation of ETSIP, using its own resources,
ahead of the pledged contributions of development partners becoming available. In July 2006,
the MoE presented a programme inception report to the DPs which met the DPs reporting
requirements. The first quarterly progress report was presented during the joint appraisal.

ETSIP has become a high profile national cause to which the government and many partners
are fully committed. ETSIP is the flagship programme of the Government of the Republic of
Namibia and there is strong national ownership and support for its implementation which will
improve the education and training system and result in higher economic growth,
employment creation and poverty alleviation and help Namibia to leap frog into a
knowledge-based economy.

Reporting
A substantive and financial reporting mechanism was agreed between the Education and
Training Sector and the DPs. This entails quarterly reports, half-yearly reports and an
annual report. The reports coincide with the GRN/Development Partners joint semi-
annual review of programme implementation and the technical discussions. Sub-
programme managers report through the three Under Secretaries and submit monthly
commitment registers as well as quarterly financial reports which are used to track
expenditure. Throughout ETSIP1 the depth and substance of reporting from sub-
programmes continued to increase resulting in more detailed reporting on specific
achievements and problems.

Achievements

Relevance of design and objectives
Sub-programmes reported that the design responded to most aspects of the specific
sections of the sector as well as a number of cross-cutting needs such as those in HIV and
AIDS. It also paved the way for systematic reporting against commonly agreed
performance indicators.

Achievement of programme objectives
All activities in Pre-primary education are either on track or achieved ahead of time. In
General Education not all activities remained on track as the initial focus on expansion of
access to senior secondary education and improved efficiency lost some thrust. In VET
the NTA was established, albeit some three years after the target date, and the NTA has
taken over the responsibility for the management and direction of the VET system.
However, the establishment of the levy system was delayed and there was not much
progress on the expansion of VET across the country. There was no increase in the
number of graduates with medium and high level skills. In Higher Education, the
National Council for Higher Education was established with a number of sub-committees
and is operational. The teacher education reform is underway and a national quality
assurance system was developed for implementation in 2012. A tracer study on the
students from the pre-entry programme shows that 69%of the graduates are enrolled in
mathematics and science on higher education level. The development of the strategic
plan, the development of the higher education information management system as well as
the funding formula for the higher education sector are delayed. It is foreseen that the
funding formula will be implemented in 2012.

Unexpected Outcomes
A new relationship was established with the private sector. The first result of this is a
management development project in the remote Kunene region to improve the
performance of a cluster of schools with a lacklustre record. Other public-private
partnerships for diverse projects like improved performance in mathematics and rentable
rural teacher housing had mixed results. Etameko is a public-private partnership that
provides exercise books to all learners in Namibia and lap desks/slates to all lower
primary learners.

                                            45
Planning was taken to levels never before reached in the MoE with the design of the
programme document and the supporting documents which guided the implementation of
the strategic plan. The team of officials involved in the development of the
implementation plans learned skills in manipulating excel workbooks and calculation
tables and became familiar with formulas, unit costs and projected costs. The ambitious
targets, which initially seemed out of reach, were accomplished. The focus on the
significance of foundation learning improved greatly.

Risks for future

Management of the programme has changed significantly during the first five years of
implementation from a tightly controlled management style to one where responsibility is
shared and accountability held at different levels. There is need to take another look at the
procedures, especially for monitoring and evaluation. The financial management needs
to be tightened to ensure that all funds requested are spent on the intended activities.

Unless the scope of the programme is brought in line with the available funding, several
activities are at risk of non-implementation. There is also risk of losing strategic focus
while responding to legitimate emerging needs.

Assessment of World Bank Performance

Quality of supervision and support

Supervision under the development period and DPL1 was substantive and contributed
greatly to the burst of implementation energy. The significant and sustained inputs of Dr
Mmantsetsa Marope during programme development sparked intense periods of capacity
development. However, the long periods that elapsed when the education sector did not
meet deadlines to complete certain parts of the work led to loss of momentum. The
delays in the signing of the loan agreements did not contribute to maintaining momentum
either. The supervision after Dr Marope left was much less substantial, hands-on and
direct. This could probably be attributed to the fact that no agreement could be reached
on the procurement of re-imbursable TA and the long period between DPL1 and DPL2.

The support received though the many World Bank consultants was top class and with
few exceptions these experts were highly valued and ministry staff were able to develop
many new skills in programme development, reporting and implementation.

Challenges during development and Implementation of ETSIP

Capacity in the MoE was identified as a possible threat to implementation during the
development of the programme and a separate sub-programme was designed.
Unfortunately, this sub-programme did not deliver on its mandate and the only activity
that was successfully executed was the advocacy of ETSIP. Procurement was also
identified as a possible problem and a procurement unit was established and trained.

                                             46
However, this unit, along with the development and implementation of procurement
plans for goods and services faded into non-existence and the MoE resorted to its
procurement practices before ETSIP.

During the design period it was envisioned that sub-programs would pool resources not
only to strengthen programme articulation, but to also realize further efficiency gains.
This did not materialise. Sub-programme managers did not produce organogrammes of
their implementation structures. They articulated implementation arrangements at the
decentralized levels, but not sufficiently. The scope of the programme over-challenged
the implementation capacity of the MoE, especially when strengthening under the
capacity development sub-programme did not take place as planned.

The costing of the programme substantially exceeded available resources. However, the
programme was never reduced in scope or reprioritised to match activities to actual
funding. The simulation model was never used as intended to inform decision taking.

Main Challenges in Further ETSIP Development
The scope of the programme remains a challenge, while programme management,
monitoring and evaluation need to be addressed. A large number of activities can be
removed from ETSIP as they have become routine activities.

The simulation model for ETSIP must updated and used as a tool to help policy makers
make informed choices that will enable them to reach the intended strategic goals within
the available resource packet. Costing will have to be revisited to inform the re-
prioritisation of the programme.

Better clarification is needed on how the ETSIP will be implemented in the decentralized
structures and how funds will flow for activities in the regions. The implementation
structure at the MoE level and regional levels has to be clearly detailed, particularly
regarding managing responsibilities; reporting procedures and operational
responsibilities/authority.

Implementation capacity, not only of ETSIP, but of all the programmes of the sector
remains a challenge.

Special attention will have to be paid to the strategic thrust of the ETSIP which is to
immediately increase the supply of middle and high level skilled labor to meet immediate
labor market demands and to effectively support the long-term strategic development
goal of improving higher value added productivity and consequently, accelerating
knowledge-driven economic growth. Another equally important strategic thrust of the
ETSIP is to progress toward equitable socio-economic development. Neither of these was
achieved in ETSIP1.




                                          47
Lessons Learned

Programme development
A large number of staff members gained skills in designing plans, budgeting, costing,
writing strategic log frames, writing a policy implementation plan, completing and
updating commitment registers and financial reports and designing and presenting
PowerPoint presentations. There is better understanding of the need for baseline studies
and a variety of surveys to be conducted before a project is started. Recording progress
and doing assessment of activities are some of the skills acquired along with computer
literacy. There is more understanding for the necessity of proper planning, induction,
training of implementers and formative and summative planning and evaluation processes.

Reporting
The results framework has been reworked and is almost complete. During the last two
ETSIP review meetings, reporting was done against the indicators. The depth of reporting
has increased and the reporting of non-implementation against the reasons for bottlenecks
and finding solutions for problems has improved.

Development of Terms of Reference and management of Technical Assistance
The procurement of technical assistance went well and inroads were made in capacity
development with regard to the design of terms of reference and the management of
consultants. Most sub-programme teams are now able to develop terms of reference for
the TA they need and have also learned to project the estimated costs and timing of
consultancies. There is greater involvement in the work of consultants and, through the
appointment of counterparts, capacity has been developed.

Development Partner Cooperation (Memorandum of Understanding)
Cooperation with Development Partners is more structured with bi-monthly meetings and
a Memorandum of Understanding to guide ETSIP implementation. There is good
representation at annual review meetings and technical discussions. The establishment of
a sector coordination forum is at an advanced stage.

Annex 6: Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The Education and Training Sector Improvement Program of the Government of
Republic of Namibia was supported by 13 Development Partners. Currently the European
Union is serving as the Coordinating Agency for the Development Partners for Education
the Republic of Namibia. The draft ICR was shared with the EU for review. Detailed
comments were provided as track changes and comments in the Word version of the draft
ICR. The final version of the ICR incorporates almost all of the comments made by the
EU. The comments were mainly related to factual corrections in the document.

The general impression from the EU was that the report is too positive with regard to
equity objectives and achievements. Many systems are still not in place to prompt a more
equitable delivery of quality education. Impression (in the report) is given that ETSIP
was pretty much focusing on equity, while it is not really the case. But overall the
“moderately satisfactory? rating sounds more reasonable than the “satisfactory? ratings of
the past years.
