                       Fixed Spread Loan (FSL) inUSDollars, to be converted to South
                       African Rand(ZAR) upon disbursement, repayable inthree years, with
I                      a single bullet payment due at maturity (2010).
                       Single tranche to bereleasedupon effectiveness, expected inJuly
  Tranching:           2007.
                       This loan is the first oftwo single-tranche sector DevelopmentPolicy
                       Loans (DPLs) of US$7.5 million each. It supports the implementation
                       of the first phase ofNamibia's Education and Training Sector
                       Improvement Program (ETSIPl). It i s also the first InternationalBank
                       for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) lendingoperation for
                       Namibia.

                       ETSIPl (2006-2011)is the first implementationphaseo fthe
                       government's 15-year strategic plan for the improvement of the
                       education and training sector (SP-ETSIP 2005-2020). Inspiredby
                       Vision 2030, the strategic plan aims to transform the education and
                       training system into a more effective tool for supportingthe attainment
                       o f core national development goals to accelerate growth, reduce
                       poverty and social inequalities, and curb the spread of HIV/AIDS.

                       DPLl supports: (i) development of specific policies and policy
                                            the
                       instruments to guide and give effect to planned sector reforms;
                       (ii) instrumentstoenforcepolicyimplementation; and
                           legal
                       (iii)institutional capacities requiredfor effective implementation of
                       planned sector reforms.
                       DPLl provides about 14percent of the financing for the first year of
                       ETSIP1. Inaddition, Banktechnical support inpreparationof DPL1,
                       assistedthe government to raise US$323.8 million external funding for
                       ETSIPl,to beusedmainly inthe last three years of implementation.
                       Bank technical support also ensures the credibility, technical integrity,
                       and development relevance ofproposed sector reforms. The
                       preparation process deepeneddevelopment partners' coordination and
                       harmonization, leadingto ajoint appraisal o f ETSIPl inOctober 2006.
                       Italso strengthened government leadership, ownership, andtechnical
                       capacity to design and implementsector reforms. The effective
                       implementation of reforms should set Namibia on track toward
                       meetingthe MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs), Africa Action
                       Plan (AAP)and, Educationfor All (EFA) goals, and answering Vision
                       2030's call to heightenthe sector's contributionto national

                       institutional reforms. Recently, the GRNhas also demonstrated
                       determination to withstandpressurefrom special interests.

                    (ii)Program implementation delays due to consultations and
                    consensus-building: The ETSIPl preparationprocessprovided
                    adequate lead time for stakeholder consultations. Several rounds o f
                    consultations have been completedand more are planned as
                    implementationprogresses.

                    to meet itsfinancial commitment to theprogram: Prudent macro-
                    economic and fiscal policies should sustain macro-economic stability,
                    thusreducingthisrisk. WithWorldBank support, the GRNraised
                    substantial grants to cover initial capital investments, which are key
                    cost drivers. ETSIPl emphasizes efficiency measures that will
                    contribute to the sustainability o f recurrent cost implications o f
                    externally funded capital investments. The GRNhas also developed
                    base, medium, and highcase scenarios for scaling ETSIPl activities
                    up or down, ifcompellingreasons arise.

                    ETSIPl up or down ifneed should arise.

                    (v) Fiduciary risk: Immediate andmedium-term mitigation measures
                    have been agreed. The implementation o f immediate measures i s
                    advanced. Recent Bank assessments concludedthat procurement and
                    financial management reforms made the government fiduciary system
                    suitable for direct budget support. The GRNalso committed to apply
                    relevant recommendations from a planned Country Integrated
                    Fiduciary Assessment (CIFA) to further strengthen its fiduciary
                    system.

                    and institutional environment for the effective implementation o f
                    planned sector reforms. It also front-loads actions to strengthen the
                    delivery capacity at the central level and to assess and strengthen
                    delivery capacity at the decentralized levels. The annual design o f
                    DPLs allows for a flexible matching o fthe scope o f work to
                    implementationcapacity as it strengthens. The broader program
                    supported by D P L l entails detailed planning for effective
                    implementationand a capacity development sub-program.

                                           I.INTRODUCTION

1.     Despite beinga middle-income country, Namibia faces formidable development challenges mostly
associatedwith low-income countries. With a Gini coefficient of 0.6, income inequalitiesare among the
highest inthe world. Poverty i s pervasive. Unemployment i s estimated at 34 percent and even higher for
youth and for the unskilled. Since independence in 1990, average growth has been lower than
government projections.' The incidence o f HIV/AIDS i s among the highest worldwide. These realities
challenge Namibia's ambition to become a high-income knowledge-based economy by 2030.

2.    A high-quality and equitable education, training, and skills development systemcould substantially
contribute to redressing Namibia's development challenges. Butrecent Bank analysis found the system
to be too weak for supporting national development. The mainweakness is poor quality, evident inlow
student learningoutcomes. Performance onregional sixth grade mathematics andreading tests i s the
worst among the 14participating countries. Highproportions of adults who have hadprimary and even
secondary education are functionally illiterate. Opportunities for post-secondary education and training
are limited. So the systemcannot supply the skills required to meet current labor market demands and to
support the futuredevelopment strategy. Another major weakness i s the inequality inthe distribution of
education outcomes and attainment. That makes the system a weak tool for redressingpoverty, and social
and income inequalities. Other weaknesses are inefficient use of available resources, the weak capacity to
deliver education services, andthe weak responseto HIV/AIDS.

3.    These weaknesses persist despite highinvestmentand appropriate broad sector policies. Over 1997
to 2006 the education systemclaimed on average 7.5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and 23
percent o f government expenditure. Lacking are specific policies that respond to specific sector
challenges within a specific Namibia context, legal instrumentsto enact specific policies, and institutional
capacities to effectively implementpolicies.

4.    The GRNhas asked for sustainedBank technical support to transform its Education, Training and
Skills Development System into a more effective tool for supportingnational development. Bank
technical support provideda solid analyticalbase to guide plannedsector reforms. It also enabled
Namibia to articulate a 15-year strategic plan for the education and training sector improvement program
(SP-ETSIP 2005-2020) and the first 5-year sector program (ETSIPl) that will beginto operationalize the
strategic plan. ETSIPl wasjointly appraisedby development partners inOctober 2006.

5.    The GRNhas also asked for two US$7.5 million single-tranche programmatic development policy
loans (DPLs) to meet the ETSIPl financing gap duringthe first two years. DPLl constitutes nearly 14
percent of the funds for the first year of ETSIP1. Inaddition to technical outputs, the Bank's technical
support, together with government efforts, successfully leveraged an additional US$323.8 million external
fundingfor ETSIPl-US$278.8         million ingrants andUS$45 million as a soft loan.

                                      11. COUNTRY CONTEXT

6.    Since its independenceon March21, 1990, Namibia has maintaineda multiparty parliamentary
democracy, with good governance, basic civil freedoms, respect for humanrights, and a fairly contained
level of corruption. InMarch 2005 President SamNujomahandedthe presidency to President
Hifikepunye Pohamba, after leading the country for the first 15 years of independence.

7.      Poverty and social indicators: Poverty and inequality trends show improvements from the levels
recorded by the 1993/1994 household income and expenditure survey. All the same, income distribution
i s still highly skewed. Against its middle-income status and per capita income of US$3,157 (2006 est.),'
Namibia stillranks among the most unequal societies, with a Gini coefficient of 0.6.3 According to the
preliminary results of the 2003/2004 survey, 10percent of the richest households account for nearly 50
percent of total consumption. The per capita income for the 90 percent o f households with the lowest
income i s about US$262, a hundredtho f the US$25,000 for the richest 2 percent o f the households. The
per capita consumption o fthe richest2 percent ofthe householdsi s 12times that o fthe 90 percent of
households with the lowest adjusted per capita income.

8.      While income inequalities seem to be narrowing, broadmeasures o f inequalities, such as the human
development index (HDI), show signs of deterioration and confirm that poverty i s pervasive. The HDIfell
from 0.734 in 1996to 0.626 in2006, partly becauseof the decline inlife expectancy owing to the impact
of HIV/AIDS.Life expectancy at birthdeclined from 61 in 1991to 41 in2005. Between2001and 2021,
the number oforphansis expected to rise from 84,000 to about 250,000 with HIV/AIDSorphans
accounting for 198,000. The national unemployment rate averages 34 percent, and is highest among the
unskilled (56 percent) and youth (40 percent).

9.         On the positive side, a few social indicators are improving. Access to basic education has become
more equitable. Primary health care facilities cover a substantial proportion of communities. On average,
87 percent (98 percent inurban and 80 percent inrural areas) of households have access to safe water;
compared with 30 percent before independence.Households with safe sanitation increased from 39
percent in 1991 to 47 percent in2003. Inquantitative terms, Namibia i s well poised to meet MDGs for
education. About 83 percent o f adults (15+ years) and 90 percent of the youth (15 to 24 years) are literate.
For 2005, net enrolment ratios for primary, basic education and senior secondary education were 94
percent, 93 percent, and 50 percent respectively. Survivalrates for grades 5, 8 and 11were 90 percent, 73
percent and 31percent respectively. In2001, the gross enrolment rate for tertiary education (taking into
account enrolment abroad) was estimated at 11percent. On average, gender parity is attained at all levels,
with a gender parity index o f more than 1infavor of females.

10.        Macroeconomic context: Since independence, Namibia has maintaineda strong recordo f
macroeconomic ~tability.~      Ithasalso developed afairly free market-oriented economy, underpinned by a
credible exchangerate pegto the South Africa Randandprudent fiscal policie~.~Economic freedom
ratings are particularly highon variables relating to low barriers to capital floks and foreign investment,
low government intervention on wages and prices, protection ofproperty rights, fairly well functioning
financial markets, and price stability. Ratings are lower for government expenditure andtrade
protectionism. Low scores on trade protectionism are mainly due to barriers imposed by Namibia's
membershipto the Southern Africa Customs Union(SACU) rather than to internalregulatory
frameworks. As a result, Namibia has experienced robust growth, moderate inflation, strong external
surpluses, and sustainedlow indebtedness. InJanuary, 2006, the Fitchgave Namibia the first sovereign
investment graderating o f BBB for long-term foreign currency.

3 The sources o f the sharp decline inthe Gini coefficient from 0.7 based onthe 1993/1994HIES to 0.6 based on the
2003/2004 HIES are still unknown. However, it is noteworthy that the level o f decline seem very high, and requires
further investigationandexplanation.

  Namibia i s also a member o f the Common Monetary Area (CMA)-which         includes Lesotho, South Africa, and
Swaziland-and     allows free trade and capital flows among members.

 15.     As a result, the fiscal deficit dropped from 7.5       -5                                         (includin
 percent o f GDP in2003/04 to an estimated 0.7
 percent in2005/06 (Figure 4). The government i s
 expected to register a small surplus in2006/07.'
 The decline inthe fiscal deficit was due to more
 effective collection o f income and value-added           I

 taxes and a windfall in SACU revenues as well as a decline inspending on goods and services, capital
 expenditures, and net lending. The deficit i s projectedto rise again to 3% percent o f GDP by 2008. Most
 o f the deficit has been financed through domestic borrowing.

 16.     Prospectsfor future growth: For 2007 and beyond, growth is expected to stabilize at 4 to 5 percent.
 Growth i s expected to be broad-based with manufacturing, tourism, and miningas key drivers. Miningi s
 expected to rise inthe medium term as diamond production shifts from land to sea-based miningand new
 mines and technology boost output o f uranium and zinc. Local polishing and cutting has the potential to
 raise value added inthe diamond industry.Strong contributions to growth are also expected from tourism,
 the wholesale and retail trades, telecommunications, and financial services.

 17.     Inthe short to mediumterm, critical risks to growth couldinclude a decline indemandbytrading
 partners, further appreciation o f the Namibian dollar, or rising oil prices. Inthe long term, growth will
 depend on the continuation o f prudent macroeconomic policies, a buildupo fthe knowledge and skill base

 18.     Debt sustuinubility: At year-end 2005/2006 Namibia's external debt (public and private) was 20.9
 percent o f GDP, lower than most other Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. The external debt to export
 ratio i s estimated at 51percent, indicating a healthy situation. Public debt as a percent o f GDP peaked at
 34 percent in2004/05 and is projected to fall to 26 percent in2007/08, close the authorities' target o f 25
 percent. Government-guaranteed debt stood at 8.9 percent o f GDP at year-end 2005/06 (Figure 4).
 However, without sufficient fiscal consolidation, the IMFprojects that the public debt ratio will begin to
 rise again in2008/09 as SACUrevenues fall. Avoiding this outcome will require concerted efforts to
 boost income and VAT collections, restrain the public sector wage bill, and curb subsidies to the
 parastatals. Other factors that could negatively affect external and public sector debt ratio include a
 significant drop inexport earnings, a rise inthe interest rate, slower GDP growth, or a depreciation of the
 Namibian dollar. Ifthe government continues to adhere to prudentmacroeconomic policies, external debt
 sustainability should not be a major concern.

21. Inresponse, the authorities strengthenedtheir commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies,
with a focus on preserving Namibia's relatively low public debt ratio compared to other SSA countries.
Efforts are also ongoing to boost the flexibility o f labor markets, improve the performanceo fparastatals
and limit their impact on the budget, clarify landreform, and enhance governance.

22.    Beyond macroeconomic stability and debt management, the government has developed Vision 2030
as a broad framework for accelerating growth and social equity. Vision 2030 sets an ambitious goal that
Namibia should become a high-income knowledge-based economy with a quality of life for all Namibians
comparable to that o f the developed world. The attainment o f this goal demands a substantially
heightened and sustainedcontribution o f all sectors o f the economy to core national development goals:
accelerating growth, reducing unemployment, especially youth unemployment, reducingpoverty and
social inequalities, and curbing the spread o f HIV/AIDS. The authorities are therefore pursuinga strategy
to diversify the economy and to achieve broad-based growth.

23.    To achieve broad based growth would require the transformationo f natural resource-based
industries into more knowledge-intensive natural resource-based industries. The government plans to do
this byapplyingknowledge andtechnology to increasethe range andvalue o fproductsderivedfrom
Namibia's richnaturalresources. Higher value-added productivity i s expected to increase Namibia's
gains from exports. Productivity growth i s also expected to improve profitability, local investment returns
and, to reduce domestic capital flight, while attracting foreign direct investment.

24.       Skill shortage has been identified as one o f the bindingconstraints to productivity growth.
Employershave stated that a shortage o f qualifiedbusiness managers, artisans, technicians, and trainable
labor i s a critical constraint to increasing productivity. Professional cadres that are particularly scarce
include natural scientists, social scientists, medical doctors, engineers, researchers, business managers,
technicians, healthnurses, and teachers for mathematics, science, and arts. The skill shortages also limit
Namibia's global competitiveness. Internationalcompetitiveness reports rank Namibia very low on its
ability to meet hiringneeds o f firms and on its investment inresearchand development. Namibia ranks
fairly highon the availability and sophistication o f its technology, but low on the capacity o f firms to
absorb that technology. These ratings further suggest the failure o f the education, training, and skills




                                                         5

development system to supply the level and quality o f labor that would allow firms to pushthe knowledge
and technology frontier.

25.       The demand for skilled labor and the continuing skills shortage indicates a constraint on the
supply side. Thus, increasingthe supply o f skilled labor would likely contributeto the national
development goal ofreducing unemployment, especially youth unemployment.* Expanding employment
opportunities would also likely increase incomes for a broader base of Namibians, helping the
government to attain its goal o freducing income inequalities and promoting social equity.

26.    Namibia's growth strategy cannot be realizedwithout substantially raising the quality o f skilled
labor. For the most part, meaningful employment will depend on creating productivejobs through the
extension o f value chains, which itself requires a highly skilled labor force. Namibia's growth strategy
thus demands arapidbuildupo ftrainable laborthat isreadily adaptableto rapidly changing knowledge
and technologies. The training and adaptability o f labor are mainly a function o f good quality general
education, combined with good opportunities for just-in-time training and life-long learning, which
Namibia currently lacks. Improving the supply o f skills through good quality and equitable education,
training, and skills development i s thus critical to accelerating Namibia's growth. Section I11below
presents the government strategy and program for addressingthe skills shortage.


           111. THE GOVERNMENT'SEDUCATIONPROGRAM(ETSIP12006-2011)

27.    Strengthening educationsector knowledge: The preparation of the government's program
(ETSIP1) started inJanuary 2003 with President SamNujoma's launching o f a Bank-supported economic
and sector work (ESW), which identified five key areas for reform:

          Increase the supply o f skills where demand i s high.
          Improve learning outcomes, particularly inmathematics, science, ICTs, and English.
          Redistribute resource inputsas a way o f increasing education achievement and attainment
          among the currently underserved segments o f the population.
          Improve efficiency inthe mobilization o fnon-government resources for the sector and
          improve efficiency inthe use o f available resources.
          Strengthen the capacity to implement reforms, including the response to HIV/AIDS.

28.    InSeptember 2004, the Cabinet adoptedthese recommendations as abase for developinga long-
term strategic plan for sector improvement.

29.    Long-term sector strategicplan: InFebruary 2005 the Cabinet approved a 15-year strategic plan
for implementing the reforms proposed by the ESW. The plan, known as the strategic plan for the
improvement o f the education and training sector (SP-ETSIP 2005-2020), was developed with substantial
Bank technical support and the participationo f 13 development partners. Consistent with
recommendations o f the ESW, SP-ETSIP focuses on five strategic policy objectives:

         Equitable expansion o f access to post-basic education and training, with a view to increasing
         the supply o f skills.


* Those with some level oftraining quickly find employment. For example, unemploymentamongsecondaryschool graduates
with some leveloftraining stands at only 4 percent.For those with some form oftertiary education, it is 2 percent. Inaddition,20
percent ofthose attending vocationaltraining centers dropoutto accept employment.Giventhe demandfor skilled labor,the
continuingskills shortageindicates aconstrainton the supply side.

0        Improvement o f education quality and effectiveness, demonstrated inincreased education
         outcomes and outputs.
e        Improvement o f equity inthe distribution o f educationresource inputs and learning
         outcomes.
0        More efficient mobilization o f resources requiredto finance the sector and more efficient use
         o f those resources.
0        Strengthenedcapacity to implement proposed reforms and to respond to the adverse impact
         o f HIV/AIDS.

30.    The priority accorded to each o f these policy objectives differs across sub-sectors based on specific
challenges facing them. For instance, ingeneral education, the first priority objective i s to improve
learning outcomes. For early childhood education (ECD) and pre-primary education, it i s to strengthen
institutional capacities requiredto expand access at these levels.

31. Thejirst medium-term sectorprogram: Over its 15 years, SP-ETSIP will be operationalized
through three five-year education and training sector improvementprograms (ETSIP 1/2/3). InAugust
2005, the Cabinet approved ETSIPl for implementationbetween 2006 and 2011. Its strategic objective i s
to equitably increase the immediate supply o f middle to highlevel skills required to meet current labor
market demands and, to lay a foundation for a sustainable supply o f skills required for future equitable
growth and for facilitating Namibia's transition to a knowledge-based economy. ETSIPl covers the entire
sector (from early childhood development (ECD) to higher education and knowledge and innovation) but
its focus i s limited to a carefully selected set o f actions that will quickly advance the attainment o f its
strategic objective.

32.    A prime strategy for increasing the immediate supply o f skills is the expansion anddiversification
o f opportunities for post-basic education and training with a focus on bringinginthe previously excluded.
Specific actions include a pro-poor expansion o f access to high-quality senior secondary education. A
range o f measures elaboratedunder the policy areas in section V will create an additional 7,533 senior
secondary school places, at least 60 percent o f them indisadvantaged areas. Six secondary magnet
schools with a focus on science, mathematics and ICTs will be established insix o f the poorest regions
(Caprivi, Kunene, Otjozondjupa, Omaheke, Oshikoto, Ohangwena, Omusati, Oshana and Kavango). The
latter region has a highproportion o f the San people. The enrolment o f these schools i s yet to be
determined. An additional 2,267 places will be created inhigh-quality, market-responsive, and
competency-based vocational and education training (VET) programs, at least 60 percent for trainees
from disadvantagedhouseholds. At the tertiary level, 200 places will be created inpre-entry science,
mathematics, and ICT programs.

33.    Actions to builda sustainable supply o f skilled labor will start with strengthening the foundation for
good quality education, training, and slulls development. This will entail the expansion o f access to good
quality ECD, pre-primary education, and competency-based basic education. By 2011, it i s expected that
50 percent o f 4 to 5 year olds and older will meet a Namibia-specific holistic child development index, 50
percent o f grade 1intake will meet school readiness criteria, and at least 50 percent of learners will meet
minimumcompetencies for eachcompleted phase o ftheir basic education cycle. The mainstreamingo f
ICTs as a tool for improving instructional quality and as a subject will be intensified to cover at least 60
percent o f secondary education and training institutions by 2011. Opportunities for adult and lifelong
learning will be increasedthrough higher enrolment inthe Namibia Literacy Programand the Namibia
College o f Open Learning (NAMCOL).

34.    To ensure feasibility o f all other actions, delivery capacity will be strengthened through direct
training, skills transfer, and on-the-job training o f key sub-program management teams. Inaddition,



                                                          7

  institutions critical for the management and delivery o f HIV/AIDS programs, pre-primary, ICTs, higher
  education, and vocational education and training will be established and competently staffed (see Annex 2
  for a summary o f ETSIPl objectives and targets).

  35.   ETSIPl implementation arrangements: ETSIP1will be implementedthrough improved GRN
  system (see Annex 5). Key improvements, informed by the results o f a capacity assessment, include clear
  definition o froles and responsibilities and enhanced lines o f accountability from the Cabinet to teachers.
  New institutionswill be established and old ones elaborated to improve the delivery o fpre-primary
  programs, VET, and tertiary education and training. ETSIPl also includes a capacity development sub-
  program, which focuses on strengthening sector leadership and effective management o f procurement
  processes, human resources, assets, information, and howledge through training and skills transfer. The
  sub-program will also strengthenthe strategic partnerships for sector development that started during
` program preparation. Direct training and skills transfer will strengthen the newly establishedprocurement
  unito fthe Ministryo fEducation(MoE) andthe budgetingand financial division. Activities o fthe sub-
  program will also include a thorough analysis o f implementationcapacity at decentralized levels.

  36.   ETSIPlfinancial and substantivesustainability: Sector improvementsentailedinETSIPl will
  cost an additional US354.9 million. Together with government efforts, the Bank's technical support
  leveraged US$323.8 million external funds, leaving a financing gap o f US$31.1 million. Most o f the
  external funds are programmedfor the thirdto fifthyears o fprogram implementation. The GRN
  requestedthe Bank to meet halfo f this financing gap (US$l5 million) to be disbursed over the first two
  years o fprogram implementation. This bringsthe total o f external funds to US$338.8 million. The GRN
  has made a special allocation duringthe medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) periodto cover
  the remaining gap.


  internal system efficiency - are expected to generate substantial savings and make the program financially
  37.   A range o f efficiency measures - primarily better management o fteachers' salaries andimproved

  sustainable (elaborated on under section V: Policy Areas). T o ensure the program's technical
  sustainability the GRNhas set aside US$2 million to pay for Bank technical support beyond the first two
  years of the loan. On a need base, this fundmay also be used to cover upstream analytical work that will
  reinforce implementationdownstream.

  that accelerate the attainment o f education MDGs, buildskills to promote growth, strengthen partnershps,

                             COLLABORATION WITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

  39.   Namibia does not have a formal programwith the IMF,but collaboration has been improving.
  Discussions duringthe 2004 Article IV consultations led to ajoint IMF/World BankFSAP (Financial
  Sector Assessment Program), a fiscal Report on Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC), and
  technical support delivered through IMFmissions. Future IMF support i s expected to focus on long-term

growth prospects, fiscal policy for 2006/07 and beyond, monetary policy and the exchangerate peg, the
health of the financial sector (especially the non-bank financial sector), and possible reforms of the
pension system and parastatals.The 2006 Article IV discussions strongly supported education sector
reforms developed with Bank technical support. Duringprogrampreparation the Bank and Fundstaff
exchanged ideas and briefedeachother.

40.   DPLl was developed incollaborationwith 13 development partners working toward consistent
policy dialogue and reduced transaction costs for the GRN. The EuropeanCommission (EC) currently
serves as the leadcoordinatingagency, the World Bank as the leadtechnical agency. Development
partners that may provide direct budget support have endorsed thejoint operation policy matrix, prior
actions for the release of the first tranche, and triggers for the release of subsequenttranches preparedby
theWorld Bank (see Annex 4). All development partners areexpectedto endorseapartnership
framework inthe form of a Memorandum o fUnderstanding (MoU) developed by GRN, the World Bank,

For the DPLl period - April 2007 to March 2008 - the development partners' group has committed about

                              RELATIONSHIPToOTHERBANKOPERATIONS

41. DPL1, the first lendingoperation inNamibia, complements an ongoing InstitutionalDevelopment
Fund(IDF) Grant for strengthening organizational arrangementsandbuildingcapacity ingovernment
bodies, particularly National AIDS Executive Committee (NAEC), the private sector and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) to address the challenges o f HIV/AIDSthrough public-private
partnerships and improved coordinationinthe fight against the disease. DPLl supports the strengthening
of the Ministryo f Education (MoE) HIV/AIDSManagement Unit (HAMU) andregional AIDS
committees Regional AIDS Committees for Education(RACES) to implement a sector HIV/AIDS policy
and programs. It also supports the mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS within ETSIPl.

                                        ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

42.   Inadditionto the GRN'sbroadpolicydocuments, the design ofthis operation was guidedby
extensive analytical work, with strikingly congruent findings andrecommendations (see Annex 8).

Government commissionedanalyticwork

43.   TowardEducationfor All (1993): Soon after independence the GRN, with the support of the United
States Agency for InternationalDevelopment (USAID), reviewed the state of the education and training
systemto chart a direction for futuresector development. This work definedsectorpolicy objectives for
democratic Namibia as equitable expansion o f access, improved internal efficiency, improved quality,
enhanceddemocratic participation, and more opportunities for lifelong learning (LLL).

44.   Presidential Commission on Education, Culture and Training (1999): Toward the close of the first
decade o f independence (1990-2000) the State President commissioned a critical review of sector
performance against policies set after independence, and to recommend directions for the seconddecade
(2000-2010). This work was undertaken mainly with support from the Swedish International
DevelopmentAgency (SIDA).The presidential commissionnoted a critical achievement o f the first
decade as the establishment o f a unitary national education system from the 11racially and ethnically
segregatedsystems of the pre-independence period. The commission declared 1990-2000 to be the decade
of access. Itrecommendedthat the second decade should be the decade of equity. The commission also
recommended that more attention be given to poor education quality and inefficiency (see Annex 8).



                                                       9                                                 r

45.    The commission's report was the first document to explicitly expressthat Namibia shouldbecome a
"learning nation inwhich all citizens have opportunities for learningthroughout their lives." It was also
the first report to warn that "because of globalization, Namibia must compete inthe knowledge-based
production of goods and services, or face increasingmarginalization."

46.    Vision 2030 background study on Human ResourcesDevelopment and Institutional Capacity
Building (2001): Backgroundwork for Vision 2030 benefitedfrom the support o f diverse development
partners, with the EC as the main financier and provider of technical assistance (TA).This analysis was to
identify critical issues inhuman resource development and institutional capacity development and to
develop a future vision and broad strategy for these areas. The overall conclusion was that shortages of
skills would persist through the Vision 2030 period irrespective of the growth scenario. The report
recommendedthe expansion o f technicians, natural scientists, engineers, pharmacists, dentists, medical
doctors, and healthprofessionals. Poor secondary school science and mathematics teaching were
highlighted as critical constraints to expand intake inthese areas of study at the tertiary levels.

47.    Vision 2030 backgroundpaper on Knowledge, Information and Technology (2002): The report
recognized that the education andtraining system i s aprime vehicle for creatingand disseminating
knowledge. Itrecommendedthat Namibia investmore inthe education and training system and sharpen
the system's responsivenessto the needs o f firms. It called for more emphasis on the development of
scienceand technology to enable Namibia not only to take advantageo f the new economy-but          also to
succeed init. It also recommendedimproving the use of ICTs to expand access to post-basic education
and training. Like the presidential commission, it recommendedthat Namibia construct a vision for
developinga truly knowledge-based economy.

Bank-led Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA)

48.    Namibia Human Capital and KnowledgeDevelopmentfor Economic Growth with Equity (2005):
This synthesis report summarizes findingsandrecommendations ofextensive analytical work conducted
between 2003 and 2005. The background work comprised 14pieces of Analytical and Advisory
Activities (AAA) work. It covered an in-depthanalysis o f eachlevel of the sector (except adult education
and lifelong learning), seven thematic areas (teacher training and professional development, curriculum,
reading, ICTs and education, training levy, textbook provision, and measurement andevaluation), an
analysis of prospects for growth, and a labor market survey (selected specific recommendations are
presentedinAnnex 8).

49.    The purpose ofthis work was to comprehensively assess the education, training, and skills
development sector and to advise on how it may best support the national development reformenvisioned
in Vision2030. The reportconcluded that the current educationandtraining systemwas too weak to
provide the envisagedlevel o f support. Itnotedphenomenal achievementsregistered since 1990, but
focused on the persisting challenges (see Section 3 and Annex 8).

50.    The Bank has no prior lendingexperience inNamibia. Lessonsthat informedthe design o f this
operation came from the four years of intensive dialogue and AAA that precededthis operation. Other
relevant lessons are derivedfrom similar operations inother African countries and inmiddle-income
countries such as Brazil.

51. Government ownership is criticalfor implementation success: The Bank's involvement inthe
sector was at the invitation o f the highest level o f the GRN. As part o f the Vision 2030process, the GRN
asked the Bank for technical guidance on how to strengthen its education, training and skills development
sector (ETSDS) to best support the national development reform agenda. Because the recommendations
of the Bank-ledAAA supported the GRN's reformagenda, they were easily adopted and translated into
an implementable long-term strategic plan and medium-term program. The design o f the DPLl sustained
the GRN's ownership. Specific policies and legal and institutional reforms supported by DPLl are
derived from the GRN's program-ETSIP1.          Prior actions for the release o f DPLl and triggers for the
release o f the second tranche (DPL2) were identified, prioritized, and sequenced inclose consultation
withthe GRN's technical andpolitical leadership. Improvedownership is changingNamibia's
implementationrecord. Well before the Bank appraisal of DPL1, over 90 percent o f prior actions were
met, and the remaining actions were on track. Before the M o U could be signed, development partners
agreed on the reportingprocedures required to be put inplace. These have now been established and are
infact already inpractice. Quarterly reports arebeingsubmittedontime andwith acceptable detail and
quality.

52.   Both technical andpolitical leadership and commitment are criticalfor implementation success:
Based on lessons from the upstream AAA, the design o f the government program supported by D P L l was
led by the GRNtechnical and political leadership. Fromthe political side, every milestone decision inthe
design process was approved by the Cabinet. The participation o fthe political leadership inbackground
work that preceded the DPLl was unprecedented. Progress inmeetingprior actions is attributable to the
strengthened M o E technical leadership and to the contributions o ftechnical leaders-from      permanent
secretaries to chief officers-f    other GRNministries, chiefs o f parastatals, the private sector, and civil
society.

53.   Inclusive consultation is criticalfor effective ownership and support: As with upstreamAAA and
(TA), the design o fthis operation was premised on participationby eight GRNministries, more than 20
private and parastatal sectors, representatives o f civil society, teacher's unions, and 13 international
development partners. Broad-based consultation buttressedbroad-based ownership and the resulting
support for implementation. Development partners that provide direct budget support have agreed to a
common operation policy matrix, prior actions for the release o fthe first tranche and triggers for the
release o f the second tranche. All development partners have agreed to a partnership framework captured
through a M o U (Annex 7), and to an internal coordination framework.

54.    Technical credibility of theprogram is criticalfor broad-based support: Duringupstream AAA
and the preparation of the sector strategy and program, the Bank brought technical expertise and
international experience from more than 15 countries.

55.   Detailedplanning boosts the technical confidence required tofacilitate implementation: The
upstream development o f ETSIPl was characterized by painstakingly detailedplanning for
implementation. Detailedplanning helpedthe GRNtechnocrats meet prior actions and keep program
implementation on track and it i s now paying dividends.

56.   Consideration of client implementation capacity is criticalfor implementation success: The design
of DPL1benefited from assessing the client's implementationcapacity and thus focuses on strengthening
institutional capacities and upfront actions that will facilitate the implementation o freforms downstream.
The operation design was accompanied by deliberate capacity development through direct training, skills
transfer to counterparts, and on-the-job training. DPLl focuses the client's attention on priority policy
outcomes to be accomplished yearly. It has also strengthened development partner coordination and

harmonizationto reduce transaction costs and the demands on client capacities. The annual design o f
DPLs allows for a flexible matching o f the scope o fwork to real andproven implementationcapacity.

57.   Alignment with the government budget andplanning cycle eases implementation: The proposed
DPL series i s aligned with the GRN's budget cycle, the planning cycle o f five-year development plans,
and the annual sector planning cycle.

                                     CHOICE OFLENDING        INSTRUMENT

58.   Although Namibia i s a first time IBRDborrower, a DPL i s suitable because the proposed support
focuses on policy, institutional, and legalreforms rather than on specific investments. The DPL improves
government ownership o f sector reforms and enhances strategic partnership insupport of those reforms.
The strengthening o f government delivery systems inherent to a DPL preparation process, lays a solid
foundation for easier implementationo f planned sector reforms. Inaddition, a DPL i s suitable because
Namibia provides a conducive environment for direct budget support. Recent Bank analysis concluded
that with marginal fine-tuning, the GRN's fiduciary system i s adequate for delivering direct budget
support. Another reason i s that the country has had experience with budget support provided by the EC
and SIDA for the sector. A D P L catalyzes systemic capacity improvements beyond the sector. As part o f
the technical dialogue for the preparation o f this loan, the GRNcommitted to undertake a Country
Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (CIFA) and to apply relevant recommendations toward hrther
strengthening o f its fiduciary system. Prospects o f an improved fiduciary system encouraged development
partners to provide substantial financial support for the sector. Excluding the IBRDloan, external funds
amount to US$323.8 million, o f which US$278.8 i s grants and US$45 million i s a soft loan negotiated
with substantial World Bank support. Given Namibia's lack o f familiarity with the Bank and its fiduciary
procedures, a D P L i s appropriate because it doesnot divert the energies o f government officials toward
learning Bank procedures and away from program implementation. This i s critical for reducing
transaction costs on the officials, especially given the demand that ETSIPl will place on their
implementation capacity. Usingthe DPL has strengthenedthe delivery capacity o f the M o E structures. At
the same time, its annual design provides flexibility for matching the scope o f work with client capacities
as they progressively improve.

                                                POLICYAREAS

Policy Area# 1:Equitableexpansionof accessto post-basic educationandtraining

60.   Emerging inMarch 1990 from South Africa's apartheid rule and institutionalizedinequalities,
Namibia's democratic government adoptedthe principle o f equal opportunity, including equal education
opportunities. The constitutiondeclared basic education (grade 1to 10) abasic humanright.Basic
education i s free. These principlesopened access mainly to basic education. A decade and a halfafter
independence, close to half(40 percent) o f4 to 5 year olds and older are enrolled insome form of early
childhooddevelopment or pre-primary education program. The adult (15+ years) literacy rate i s 83
percent and youth literacy (ages 15 to 24) i s about 90 percent. In2005, net enrolment ratios were 94
percent for primary (grades 1-7), 93 percent for grades 1-10, and 50 percent for secondary education
(grades 8-12). The primary completion rate was 92 percent and 90 percent ofthe cohort reached grade 5.
Progression between primary and secondary education i s 85 percent, but much lower (53 percent)
betweenjunior secondary and senior secondary levels. The tertiary gross enrolment ratio i s estimated at
11percent, taking into account enrolment abroad. About 35,000 adults (70 percent women) are enrolled
intheNationalLiteracyProgramandnearly 25,000 inanalternative secondary education program
offered by the Namibian College o f Open Learning (NAMCOL).

61.   Mainchallenges:Despite impressive progress inopening access, Namibia's education and training
systemstill fails to supply the middle-to high-levelskilled laborrequiredto meet current labor market
demands and to facilitate the national growth strategy. That strategy i s premisedon the capacity to apply
knowledge and technology to extend the range and value o fproducts from the country's richnatural
resource base.

62.   A core cause of skills deficit is the lowtransitionrate to post-basic education andtraining. Only 31
percent of a grade 1cohort reaches senior secondary school. Opportunities for vocational education and
training are sharply limited.Only 3 percent of grade 10 completers gain access to vocational training
centers. Tertiary enrolment rates still fall well below those of the countries that Namibia wants tojoin by
2030. Outputs are extremely low infields that require a mathematics and sciencebase such as technical
and engineeringfields, natural scientists, medical doctors, and nurses. The university produces only about
one-tenth of the projected annual demand for degree level scientists. Post-graduate programs are limited.

63.   Government actions:The first phaseofthe GRN's sector reformprogram(ETSIP1) prioritizes the
supply of middle-to high-level skilled labor by expanding accessto post-basic education andtraining.
Grade 11places will be increasedfrom 14,967 in2005 to 22,500 by 2011, by increasingclass size to no
more than 35 where the student populationpermits, efficient use o f existingspace through better
organized scheduling, extending good performing senior secondary schools, and constructingnew senior
secondary schools. Six science, mathematics, and ICT secondarymagnet schools will also be established
inthe poorest regions to boost quality output inthese subjects. EnrolmentinVocational Training Center
(VTC) programs that meet the criteria of quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness will beraised from
2,733 in2005 to 5,000 by 2011. Specific measuresfor doing so are to increase intake inVTCs that meet
the criteria o f quality and efficiency, the provision of scholarships for external training where itproves to
be cost-effective ando f good quality, and the construction ofnewVTCs. Universityscience,
mathematics, and technology pre-entryprograms will be established, rapidly increasingenrolments to 200
by 2011. This should enablemore learners to qualify for entry into mathematics, science, andtechnology
specializations. Intake inuniversity andpolytechnic Englishfoundationcourses will be increased from
1,148 in2005 to2,416by2011.

64.    Prior actionsfor DPL1:Overall, DPLl supports the equitable expansion and diversification of
opportunities for post-basic education and training. A range o fpolicy actions will be taken to expand
access to senior secondary education, vocational education and training and tertiary education and
training (ref. Annex 3). The first prior action i s for the M o E to adopt an action plan that will enable an
annual 7 percentage point increase insenior secondary intake (grade 1l),        with 60 percent o fnew places
created inthe poorest regions. This action addresses the needto equitably expand access to post-basic
education. The second prior action i s for the M o E to develop a plan for increasing the intake inuniversity
pre-entry mathematics, science and ICTsprograms. The planwill enable a cumulative annual intake o f 50
students ineach o f the three priority areas. Expanded intake inthese areas should help Namibia address
its critical scarce skills- engineers, technologists, healthprofessionals,dmedicaldoctors, etc.

PolicyArea # 2: Improvingeducationqualityand effectiveness, as manifestinstudent learning
outcomes

65.    In1990Namibia's democratic government inheriteda system that was deliberately designedto
provide inferior education and training for the majority o f the non-white population. Great strides have
been taken toward increasing such quality-enhancing inputsas qualified teachers, books and instructional
materials, permanent classrooms, and blueprints for fairly progressive curricula and pedagogy.

66.    Mainchallenges: Inqualitative terms, the systemremainsineffective. Although adult literacy rates
are high, a 2003 World Bank assessment showed.that a highproportion o f adults are functionally
illiterate. Namibia ranks lowest among its peers inthe             I Figure5: SACMEQ Readingand MathScore2000 1
Southern Aflica Development Community (SADC) region
instudentperformance onreadingandmathematics
(Figure 5). Recent Monitoring Learning Achievement
(MLA) tests show that two-thirds o fgrade 6 learners
cannot readwith any level o f competence. Primary school
leavers are therefore likely to add to the pool o f
functionally illiterate youth and adults. Over halfthe
graduates o fjunior secondary school do not meet the
academic entry requirements for senior secondary school.
L o w academic performance in general education leads to
problems intertiary education. L o w learning achievement
contributes to exceptionally low university completion
rates o f 20 percent inscience, 35 percent inhumanities, and 44 percent ineducation.

67.    Governmentactions: Specific actions to improve quality will betaken at each level o fthe sector.

68.    For early childhood development: The international index for holistic child development will be
adapted for the Namibia context and Early Childhood Development (ECD) programs will be revised to
facilitate holistic child development. A training programwill be developed for ECDcare-givers to enable
themto implement the revisedprograms andthe MoEwill provide relevant learningmaterials. Child
development assessment instruments will be improved with a view to include key elements o f the adapted
international index.

69.    For pre-primary education: The National Institute for Education Development (NIED)will clearly
articulate competencies that constitute adequate learner readiness for primary schooling. The list of
competencies will be used as a base to revise the pre-school teacher training program and to revise the
current ten-week school readiness program into a one-year program. The revised pre-primary teacher
training programwill be modularizedand integrated into the lower primary education pre-service and



                                                         14

in-service teacher training. Enhanced assessment tools will be developed and usedto assess learner school
readiness.

70.   For general education: Competencies and skills to be acquired by learners at eachphase o ftheir
general education will be clearly articulated. Curricula will berevisedinline with defined skills and
competencies, taking note of competencies associatedwith effective functioning ina knowledge-based
economy. Teacher pre-service and in-service training programs will be alignedwith the revisedlearner
curricula. Inaddition, structured in-service training programs will be expanded to qualify 100percent of
primary and secondary school teachers by 2011. To sustain teacher professional currency, a time-bound
teaching license will be introduced. A substitute teacher systemwill also be introducedto abate the
impact of teacher absenteeism- associatedwith HIV/AIDS- on student learning. Textbooks and
instructional materials will be increased and ICTs will be mainstreamed to facilitate teaching. The current
systemof monitoring learner acquisitionofagreedskills and competencies will be strengthenedthrough
the introductionof standardized and diagnostic tests at grades 5 and 8.

71.   To further improve student learning, performance targets will be set for schools, and school
management will be held accountable for meetingthose standards. To support principals intheir role as
instructional leaders, school-basedteacher professional development will be strengthenedby deploying an
expert mathematics, science, English, and ICT teacher to each school that i s unlikelyto meet its
performance target. Finally six science, mathematics, and ICT magnet schools will be established inthe
most disadvantagedregions to further improve learning outcomes.

72.   For vocational education and training: Key plannedactions are to: introducemodularized
competency-based education and training (CBET), upgrade instructor qualifications, re-equiptraining
centers, and revise trade tests inline with the requirementsof CBET.

73.   For tertiary education and training: Keyactions include expanding science, mathematics, English,
and ICT pre-entryprograms to raise studentreadiness at entry and foundation courses to sustain
                                                                  -
academic support for students who needit. Academic staff development programs will be systematized
and expanded to raise the quality of teaching and research. A quality assurancesystem will be
strengthenedto better monitor student and staffperformance.

74.   Prior actions for DPL1: DPLl supports arange ofpolicy and institutional actions to improve
education quality at all levels of the system. The first prior action i s the approval o f a policy to introduce
standardized diagnostic tests at grade 5 and 8. These tests are critical for early and close monitoring o f the
impact of proposed education quality reforms on student learning. Measurable outcomes for this prior
action are better qualitative monitoring of student learning and a 10percentagepoint increase inthe
proportion of learners who complete lower primary having mastered core skills and competencies. The
secondprior action i s the MoE's adoption o f a planto enable a 5 percentagepoint increase inthe annual
budgetallocation for primary and secondary school books and instructionalmaterials. Increasedsupply of
books and instructionalmaterials i s basal for the improvement o f student learning. The thirdaction i s the
approval of a sector policy on ICTs. This i s crucial for laying a foundation for the: integration o f ICTs in
school curricula and co-curricula activities, use of ICTs for effective teaching and learning, education
informationand knowledge management, and effective sector management.

75.   Triggers for DPL2: The revisedlower primary curriculum will beunder implementation inall
schools, all schools will be assignedindividual performance targets, and a textbook policy will be
approved.

 PolicyArea # 3: Eradicatinginequalitiesinthe distributionof resourceinputs

 76.    A key achievement ofpost-independencereforms was dismantling the 11racially and ethnically
 segregatededucation systems and integratingthem into one national education and training system. Broad
 policies were also adopted to improve equity ineducation and training. Substantial effort was made to
 equalize the provision of classrooms, qualified teachers, books and instructional materials and other
 inputs known to facilitate teaching and learning.

 77.    Mainchallenges: Despitebroadpolicies and gallant efforts, education resource inputsremain
 highlyinequitable among regions and disfavorthe historicallydisadvantaged north, where schoolshave
 lessphysical, human, and financial resources.Inequalitymanifests itselfintwo ways-the         lack of
 physicalaccess to schools by some children and the lack of access to quality instructionby students
 already inschool. Lack of physical access applies mainly to pre-primary education (20 percent of the age
 group covered) and secondary education (53 percent of children 14 - 18 years).

 78.    Input and outcome inequalities have persistedbecause of the lack o f specific policies and resource
 allocation instrumentsrequiredto advance equity. Over the years the input-based system of allocating
 financial resourcesdiscriminatedagainst under-resourced schools. Schools with better qualified teachers,
 low student-to-teacher ratios, and adequate infrastructure receive more fundingper learner than poorly
 resourced schools, exacerbating the inequalities of inputs.Moreover, public spending on education i s pro-
 rich, especially at the tertiary level. Recent incidence benefitanalysis showed that the richest 20 percent
 o f the populationreceives nearly 60 percent of public spendingon tertiary education and training.

 79.    Inequalities inthe distribution of learningoutcomes mirror the disparities inresource inputs.With
 the exception ofthe recent performance improvement inthe Oshikoto region, secondary school
 examinations results are still lower inthe northernregions than inthe rest o f the country. On average,
 each additional year of senior secondary education delivers 28 percent more inprivate returns and each
 year of post-secondary education delivers 34 percent. Because educational attainment i s a significant
 determinant of earnings and because educational outcomes determine attainment, current inequalities in
 outcomes make the education and training systema weak instrumentfor facilitating social equity.

,80.    Government actions:The overallpolicy outlook ofETSPl is pro-poor. Specific actions to
 eradicate persistinginequalities include apro-poor expansion o f access to pre-primary education witha
 view to have universalaccess by 2020. Inputnorms for all schools andVTCs will be established and a
 pro-poor sequence will be followed inenabling schools to meetthe norms. A normativeper capita
 financing for general education will be introducedas well as conditional grants for schools that cannot
 meet input norms based only on per capita financing. The first six magnet schools will be established in
 the poorest northernregions and their entrancecriteria will mainly be basedon aptitude andnot only
 achievement. Inaddition, a quota systemwill be institutedto enable children from disadvantaged areas to
 gain entry to grade 11. Conditional grants will be introduced for schools that ensure successful
 participation and graduation o f OVCs. School pastoral counseling and school-health programs will be
 revitalized / established starting with rural and disadvantaged schools to provide more support for OVCs.
 Equally, adult education, training, and LifelongLearning (LLL)programs will be expanded / introduced
 incurrentlyneglected areas.

 81.    Prior actionsfor DPL1.DPLl will support the MoEefforts to introduce apolicy onper capita
 fundingfor primary schools, secondary schools, andVTCs. This will enableunder-resourced schools and
 VTCs to acquire education quality-enhancing inputsrequiredto meet their performance standards.DPL1
 will also support preparatory work toward establishing inputn o m that all schools andVTCs should
 meet by 2020.



                                                       16

82. Triggers for DPLZ:A school register o fneeds will be established as a base for developing input
norms and standards and for evidence-based monitoring o f equity inthe distribution o f education inputs.
The Cabinet will approve a plan for a phased withdrawal o f subsidies to private profit-making schools.

PolicyArea # 4: Improvingefficiency inresourcemobilization andutilization

83.    The GRNinvests heavily inits education and training system. Between 1997 and 2003, the
proportion o fthe GDP allocated to the sector averaged 8.95 percent, with a peak o f 9.7 percent in
2001/02. Inline with the GRN's commitment to curb public spending while improving its efficiency, the
allocationhas been declining and i s projected to reach 6.7 percent by 2008. The share o f government
spending on the sector i s also expected to decline from 24 percent in2003 to 22 percent by 2008. Even
with the projecteddeclines, investment levels will still rank among the highest inthe world.

84.    Challenges: The sector has beeninefficient inusingresources (Figure 6). Namibia realizes
relatively lower education coverage and quality than other SADC middle-income countries that invest
less intheir education and training systems. The sector has               Figure 6: Total education efficiency to

The GRNhas virtually been an exclusive financier o f sector
developments, with marginal contributions from DPs, private
providers, the private sector, and households.

85.    One source o f resource wastage i s low internal system
efficiency, resultingmainly from poor quality and
effectiveness (see Policy Area # 2). Average repetitionrates
are 16 percent, 15 percent, and 2 percent for primary, junior
secondary and senior secondary education respectively.                      0         2         4         6          8       10
Dropout rates are 4 percent and 16percent for primary and                   Public Expendimreon Educationas a PercentageofCDP

secondary education respectively. Secondary school dropout
rates are exaggeratedby a 47 percent `push-out' rate between
junior secondary and senior secondary education due to a combination of failure rates and inadequate
grade 11places.

86.    A second source i s unmanagedteacher salaries, whichhave runwell above the inflationrate over
the past three years. In2004 the GRNapproved an unprecedented increase inteacher entry salary scale,
which had to be reversed in2005 after 400 teachers hadbenefited. Due mainly to teachers' salaries, the
sector has been runninga growing budget deficit, projectedto reachUS$305.6 million by 2010/11(see
Table 1).


teacher ratio (LTR) was 2 8 5 in2005 - 32: 1and 25: 1for primary and secondary schools respectively.
87.    A third source o finefficiency is the underutilizationo fteachers. The national average learner to

Beyond sector-specific factors, the GRN's procurement practice o f applying price preferences infavor o f
historically disadvantaged entities within a context o fnational competitive biddingi s likely to inflate the
cost o f service delivery within the sector.

88.    Government actions: Quality improvementmeasures outlinedunder Policy Area # 2 are expected
to improve internal efficiency and resource efficiency. An automatic promotion policy allows learners to
repeat only once within a school phase. The GRNhas also undertaken to reduce the grade 10push-out
rate from 47 percent in2005 to 5 percent by 2011through measures outlined inPolicy Areas # 1and #2.




                                                      17

89.    Other actions include an increase inthe learner teacher ratio from a 2005 average o f 2 8 5 for both
primary and secondary schools to 40: 1for primary schools and 35: 1for secondary schools by 2008.
Physicalresources will be more efficiently used. Teacher salary increments will be de-linked from non-
required and irrelevant qualifications. Inaddition, teachers' salaries will be restructured to slow the pace
o f increments. All institutions will implement staffing norms. It is estimated that the combined effects o f
these efficiency measures will reduce the deficit to US$51million (ref. Table 1).

improve internal efficiency and better manage teachers' salaries will result insignificant savings - a
90.    The World Bank's simulations o foptimum efficiency gains show that the outlined measures to

cumulative total o f US$179 million between 2006 and 2010, at an estimated inflation rate o f 4 percent. As
a proportion o f expenditures, these savings increase to 12 percent by 2010. This level o f savings would be
sufficient to increase the number o f learners inthe senior secondary phase from a projected 32,402
without savings to a projected 40,122 with savings (Figure 7). Between 2006 and 2010 the savings would
enable an increase injunior secondary and senior secondary school gross enrolment rates from 84 percent
to 91 percent and from 34 percent to 40 percent respectively. While the increase insecondary school
learners (once efficiency savings have been realized) looks somewhat small innet terms, the reduction in
the repetitionrate means that a substantial number o f extra students would be admitted into the system at
relatively little extra cost.

131.   The GRNstrategy also entails more effective resource mobilization for the sector. A payroll levy
 ?asbeen established to improve private sector funding and guidance for vocational education and training
 :VET). The GRNhas successfully broadenednational and international partnerships for sector
 jevelopment, generatingUS$338.8 million to be used between 2006 and 2011. Inaddition, the Cabinet
 mdorsed the decision to use ETSIPl as a pilot for a more resource-efficient procurement practice, which
 mtails not applying price preferences within National Competitive Bidding(NCB). This is expected to
 -educecosts through more competitive bidding and awarding bids to the lowest evaluated bidders.
 Efficiency gains from this pilot (the amount not yet known) will be tracked duringprogram
 mplementation.

 32.   Prior actions for DPL1: The prior action is an operational plan for reducing: (i) averagethe
repetition rate for basic education (grade 1 to 10) from 15.5 percent to 14percent; -(ii)      grade 1repetition
from 19.6 percent to 16 percent; (iii)   grade 5 repetition from 22.1 percent to 19 percent; (iv) grade 8
repetition rate from 23.1 percent to 20 percent; (v) grade 10push-out rate from 47 percent to 40 percent;
as well as increasing primary LTR from 31:1to 32:1and secondary LTR from 25: 1to 26:1.

93.    Triggers for DPLZ: Increments to teachers' salaries will be delinked from irrelevant and non-
required qualifications and linkedto performance.

Policy Area # 5: Strengthening delivery capacity andthe responseto HIV/AIDS

94.    In2004 the Ministry o fBasic Education, Sport and Culture (MBECS) andthe MinistryofHigher
Education, Training and Employment Creation (MHETC) were merged into one M o Eto pool resources
and coordinate sector development. The organizational structure o f the new M o Ewas approved inAugust
2006. At a national level, the Office o f the Prime Minister introduced an integrated performance
management system, and the M o E volunteered to be among the pilot ministries. Inaddition, the MoE,
withjoint support from SIDA and the EC, has established an institutional strengthening and capacity
building facility. The facility has funded TA to strengthen the capacity o f the MoE. It has also funded
school management training for school principals and school boards. Regional inspectors were also
trained on national standards for schools - developed with support from the facility. Recently the M o E
assessed its capacity to implement ETSIPl, to plan procurement and manage procurement processes, and
to carry out the detailed budgeting required for the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS)
recently introduced by the Ministry of Finance (MoF).

95.    Challenges: While the MoE's capacity gaps are well known, most o fthe assessmentsconcentrated
on the headquarters level. There is therefore a knowledge gap on capacity limitations at the regional,
circuit, and school level. At the center, effective delivery has beenhampered by the lack o f clear policies



                                                          19

to guide service delivery, the lack o f legal frameworks and instruments to enact policies, and lack o f
institutionsthat should take responsibility for service delivery. These limitations have been particularly
acute inemerging areashues like HIV/AIDS and ICTs ineducation, but also insome fairly traditional
sub-sectors like VET andhigher education. For example, the GRNhas a generic policy to eradicate
inequalities ineducation opportunities. However, policy instruments to equitably distribute education
resource inputsand outcomes are at best blunt and at worst non-existent.

96.    Other causes o f limited delivery capacity are the weak technical know-how to effectively plan for
implementation or service delivery. Other general weaknesses identifiedby the capacity assessment
exercise were limited experience inplanningfor and executingprocurement functions o fthe MoE, and in
the meticulousbudgetingrequiredfor the recentlyintroducedIntegratedFinancialManagement
Information System (IFMIS).

97.    Government actions: The SP-ETSIP lists delivery capacity and management as one o f its key
policy objectives. At the same time, the M o E appreciates that capacity has to be strengthenedthrough use,
or as implementation progresses. The M o E has thus adopted a dual-pronged strategy o f front-loading the
strengthening o f critical capacities required for the effective implementation o f ETSIPl while
programming the systemic capacity development over time. For the immediate to medium-term actions,
the M o E has identifiedthe need to articulate policies, legal and institutional frameworks to underpin the
implementation o freforms. It also identified the needto rationalize the division of labor inthe sector and
to re-align its new M o E structure. Leadership and management capacities will be strengthened through
training and skills transfer. The M o E contracted TA to facilitate the setting up o f HAMU,RACESand
their programs. These structures are expected to increase the proportion o f learners taking life skills
education (LSE) from 60 percent in2007 to 95 percent in2011.The number o f OVCs receiving
nutritional support will increase from 120,000 in2007 to 160,000 by 2011. Those receiving psychosocial
support will increase from 16,000 to 25,000 within the same period. Other identifiedneeds are
strengthening the resource mobilization, procurement and budgeting functions o f the M o E through direct
and on-the-job training.

98.    Prior actions for DPLl:This operation will support a comprehensive assessment o fcapacity,

institutions vital for implementing the ETSIPl.Prior actions that relate to the strengthening o f
including the lower levels o f sector service delivery. It will also support the establishment o f critical

institutional capacities for specific sub-sectors are as follows:

99.   Pre-primary education: The Cabinet will approve the transfer o fpre-primary education from the
MinistryofGender Equalityand ChildWelfare (MGECW) to the MoE. Placingthis sub-sector inthe
Ministrywiththebesttechnical capacity is critical for future development ofgoodquality pre-primary
education.

100. VET: The Cabinet will approve a new VET Bill to allow for the establishment o f the Namibia
Training Authority (NTA), with employers as the majority o f boardmembers. This action i s expected to
reorient the training system to employer requirements and improve accountability and performance.

101. Tertiary education and training: Legislation will be adopted for the establishment o f the National
Council for Higher Education (NCHE) and a competent secretariat. These institutions are critical to
spearhead the development o f tertiary education and training and to advise the Minister of Education.

102. HIV/AIDS in education: The Cabinet will approve a sector policy on HIV/AIDS. This will enable
the creation o fthe HIVIAIDS Management Unitand Regional AIDS Committees for Education. These




                                                       20

structures are critical for strengthening the sector's response to HIV/AIDS.They will also provide M o E
directorates appropriate technical support to mainstream HIV/AIDS inall sub-programs.

103. ICTs in education: The Cabinet will approve a sector ICTspolicy. This will enable the
establishment o f ICT units at the M o E headquarters, at NIED, and inregional offices to design and
oversee the implementationo f ICT programs. The tmits will also support the integration o f ICTs in
teaching, learning, and sector management.

PrincipalBenefits


the first year - 2007/08 o f ETSIP1. The Bank's technical assistance associated with DPLl has
104. DPLl provides nearly 14percent o f the external fundingrequired to close the financing gap during
                           -
strengthened government leadership, ownership, and technical capacity to design and implement sector
reforms. It has also provided support required to pursue policy, legal, and institutional reforms that will
enable hture sector developments. Inaddition to government efforts, the Bank TA leveraged the
US$323.8 million external fundingrequiredto finance the GFWs sector reformprogram. The Bank's TA
ensured the credibility and development relevance o f proposed sector reforms. Itprovided a vehicle for
strengthening development partner coordination and harmonization, culminating ina successful joint
appraisal o f ETSIPl inOctober 2006.

105. Specific to Namibia's core development goals, improved education quality and effectiveness will
ensure a steady supply o f skilled labor required for higher value-added productivity growth. The
improved supply of skills will also help Namibia reduce unemployment, especially for youth          - theprime
beneficiaries o f the education and training system. Improved education equity will help Namibia realize
the redistributive effects o f education and training - and the consequent reduction inpoverty, income
inequalities, and broader social inequalities. Expanded and sustained access to education has also proven
to be the most effective social vaccine to HIV/AIDS and can help Namibia realize its core goal o f curbing
the spread o f HIV/AIDS.

106. Effective implementation o f sector reforms will help Namibia realizebenefits associated with
quality and equitable education, training, and skills development system. The benefits include improved
absorptive capacity for other social services, including health and education itself. Other benefits are low
fertility rates; higher use o f contraceptives; gender parity; better social participation and participatory
democracy; good governance and effective participation ina knowledge-based economy. Sector
improvements will also facilitate progress toward education MDGsand goals for EducationFor All
(EFA) and the AAP.


                                  VI. IMPLEMENTATIONOFDPLl

                                        POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACT

107. Poverty impact: Ingeneral, DPLl supports policy, legal, and institutional reforms that increase the
sector's contribution to accelerated and equitable growth. The operation capitalizes on the redistributive
effects o f education and training, which should significantly reduce poverty and broad social inequalities.
Specific policies supported by DPLl are pro-poor, and policy actions follow a pro-poor sequence. The
first key policy focuses on equity in distributingeducation resource inputs and outcomes. Related pro-
poor actions include: (i)   adopting a policy on per-capita financing; (ii) developing standards to be met by
all schools; (iii) institutingconditional grants for,schoolsthat will not meet set standards basedonly on




                                                       21

per capita funding; (iv) establishing magnet schools indisadvantagedregionsand creating admission
criteria that are pro-poor; and (v) establishing conditional grants for OVCs.

108. The secondpolicy measure i s the pro-poor expansion of opportunities for good quality post-basic
education and training. Expandingaccess to good quality education andtraining will broadenthe base of
Namibians who realize the benefitsof education and training. Those benefits include broader employment
opportunities, better income, reduced fertility, enhancedsocial participation, enhancedabsorptive
capacity for social services including education itself, genderparity, and overall poverty reduction and
social equity. Greater access to quality education i s therefore one o f the critical redistributive policies that
Namibia will use to facilitate the sharing of growth. Inaddition, the enhancedsystem capacity to respond
to HIVIAIDSwill helpcurb the spread of HIV/AIDSand stemthe expansion ofAIDS-related orphans.
Duringimplementation, close attention willbepaidto monitoringDPLl benefits for the poor andthe
marginalized.

109. Beneflts to indigenouspeople: Insupporting the GRNto strengthen policies that promote equal
education opportunities, DPLl will benefit indigenous segments o f the population. DPLl supports setting
performance standards that all schools should keep and establishing conditional grants to enable under-
resourced schools to meet set standards.Following a pro-poor sequencing, the currently under-resourced
schools that cater to indigenous people will beprimebeneficiaries. These schools include satellite schools
that respondto seasonalmovements of indigenous people, including multi-grade schools for the children
o f farm workers and mobile schools for cattle herders. Annex 9 provides a more detailed account o f
poverty and social aspects.

                                         PARTICIPATORYASPECTS

110. Namibia adopted an impressive participatoryapproach inconductingthe analytical work, the long-
term sector strategy, and the medium-termsector programthat provide a base for this operation. Three
national consultative forums, two fundraising round table meetings, and several rounds ofregional and
district level consultations were undertakenbetween2003 and 2006. Participants includedthe former and
current State Presidents, the former and current Prime Minister,a large number of Cabinet Ministers,
Regional Governors, educators at all levels, and representatives of regional education forums. They also
includedthe private sector, parastatals, civil society, community leaders, faith-based organizations,
teachers' unions, research groups, government think tanks, students, and parents. And they included
NGOs and Community BasedOrganizations (CBOs) with experience inworking withmarginalized
communities, such as Nyae Nyae Development Foundation, RossingFoundation, Omba Arts Trust, and
the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities of Southern Africa (WTMSA). At each criticaljuncture, the
decision to move to the next step of programpreparation was endorsed by the Cabinet. The design also
includedthe participationof internationalexperts from more than 15 countries and o f 13 international
development partners.

111. Despite a very successful process, concernshave beenraisedabout the participationofpeople with
special needs, district educators and teachers, and marginalizedcommunities. While direct contact posesa
hugechallenge for a country the size ofNamibia, arrangementsare inplace to sustain andfurther broaden
participation duringimplementation. The MoE has engaged a company to support the design and
execution of an advocacy campaign for ETSIPl.

                           IMPLEMENTATION,      MONITORING, EVALUATION
                                                                AND

112. The MoE will take overall responsibility for the implementationo f DPLl and final accountability
for the attainment of policy outcomes supported by DPLl     .TheMinister     of Educationwill apprise the



                                                      22

Cabinet of progress toward the policy outcomes o f this operation. The MoE will be supported by the
MinistryofGenderEquality andChildWelfare, responsible for the early childhooddevelopment aspects
of the operation; the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, which supports the ICT aspects of the
operation; the National Training Authority, responsible for developingthe VET aspects; the National
Council for Higher Education(NCHE) for spearheadingthe development of tertiary education and
training, and for advising the Minister; the Ministryo fFinance, accountable for adequately financing the
overall program; and the National Planning Commission, responsible for retainingthe alignment o f
programobjectives to the overall strategic outlook o f Vision 2030 and the specific development objectives
of the National Development Plan (NDP3).

113. The GRNand its development partners have agreedto abroad framework for monitoringprogress
toward attaining keypolicy outcome indicators (Annex 2). Inaddition, development partners that provide
direct budget support have agreed to a common operation policymatrix (Annex 4) as a base for
monitoringpolicy output and outcome indicators. The common matrix i s articulated with the DPL policy
matrix. This collaborative monitoring framework provides for supporting, monitoring, and evaluating
implementation. Within the MoE, the directorate of planningwill take overall responsibility for the
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) functions o f ETSIPl and areas supported by DPL1. It will be
supported by sub-sector directorates that will focus on their specific sub-programs. For development
partners,joint supervisions will be the main monitoringmechanism. They will be undertaken twice a year
within the establishedpartnership framework (Annex 7) and harmonized monitoringprocedures, thus
reducingtransaction costs for the GRN's team. Agreed procedures include quarterly progress reports,
joint semi-annual and annual reviewsofprogress toward meetingagreedpolicy outputs and outcomes.

114. The reviewprocesseswill also provide opportunities for programadjustments inresponseto
changing contexts, basedon the performance of the operation and on feedback from stakeholder
consultations. Specific policy outcomes to be monitoredunder DPLl (Annex 3) are basedon the ETSIPl
outcome indicators and targets (Annex 2). Joint supervisions will also monitor overall progress toward
meetingcommonprior actions for tranche release and triggers for moving to subsequent DPLs. In
assessingprogress thejoint supervision team will also consider outcomes outside the control o f the MoE
that relate to core national development goals that the DPL series is meant to support-employment
creation, productivity growth, economic growth, fewer new HIV/AIDS infections, and social equity
trends. The team will also take into account factors outside the GRN's control that may pose risks to the
intendeddevelopment outcomes, and timely adjustments will be made to the overall program.

                                           FIDUCIARY    ASPECTS

 115. Because of the Bank's minimal engagement inNamibia, regular Bank fiduciary assessments like
the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), Country Procurement Assessment Review
(CPAR), and Public ExpenditureReviews(PERs) have not been undertaken. Programpreparationwas
therefore accompanied by intense Bank effort to understand the fiduciary environment and dialogue with
the GRNon areas of concern. Weak points inthe GRNsystemwere identifiedand agreementsreached on
how to address them (see par. 123-125). The execution of these agreementsi s on track and, overall, recent
Bank assessmentsconcluded that the fiduciary environment was conducive for direct budget support.

116. The Bank's knowledge was basedon its own assessments and on assessmentscarried out by other
development partners. An assessment ofNamibia's public financial management systems, usingthe
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) performance indicators, commissioned bythe
European Union was completed inNovember 2004. This reviewconcluded that Namibia's public finance
management (PFM) systemwas basedon a sound legislative foundation with modern standards and
procedures. Basic budget and accountability structures were inplace and appearedto be adequate.



                                                     23

Responsibility and accountability for public hnds were delegated to individuals through the system, with
clear and well-documented roles and responsibilities for all stakeholders. There were clear statements o f
the powers and duties for the Treasury and for the Auditor-General, while appropriate oversight was
exercised by the legislature.

117. Inthe absence o fthe IMFsafeguards assessmento fthe Bank o fNamibia(BoN), the World Bank
carried out a review o f the latest available audited financial statements o f BoN, for the year ended
December 31,2005. After reviewing internal control, internal audit, accounting, financial reporting, and
external audit arrangements, the Bankwas satisfied that the control environment inthe B o Ni s adequate.
The audited financial statements were unqualified, prepared, and submitted to Parliament within the set
timetable. N o major internal control issues that would negatively affect the proposedoperation were
identified. The B o Nroutinely provides banking services to the GRNinlocal and foreign currencies. It
confirmed its ability andreadiness to provide services as noted below inthe section on Disbursement and
Auditing.

118. Going forward, the government, the Bank, and other development partners needto better
understand the PFMcapacity development needs o fNamibia through a deeper PFMdiagnostic. For this
purpose, the government agreed to carry out a comprehensive CountryIntegratedFiduciary Assessment
(CIFA).The proposed CIFA integrates the diagnostic processes o fthe CFAA, CPAR, and PERand
would provide a comprehensive and integrated assessment o fNamibia's key fiduciary risks inthe areas o f
public financial management and procurement at both central and local government level.


                                         DISBURSEMENT       ANDAUDITING

119. Disbursement:The proposed loanwill follow the World Bank's disbursement procedures for
DPLs. The loanproceeds will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation o fthe development policy
programand not tied to any specific purchases or be subject to procurement requirements. Once the
World Bank's Boardapproves the loan and at the request o f the Borrower, the World Bank will disburse
the proceeds o f the loan ina single tranche o fUS$7.5 million into an account designatedby the Borrower
that i s part o f the country's foreign exchange reserves account at BoN. The Borrower shall ensure that
upon the deposit o f the Loan into the said account, an equivalent amount i s creditedinthe Borrower's
budget management system, ina manner acceptable to the World Bank. The Borrower will report to the
World Bank on the amounts deposited inthe foreign currency account and credited inlocal currency to
the budget management system. Ifthe proceeds o f the loan are used for ineligible purposes (say, to
finance goods or services on the standardnegative list), as defined inthe Loan Agreement, upon notice
from the World Bank the Borrower will be required to promptly refund an amount equal to the amount o f
said payment.

120. Auditing: The GRNwill prepare financial statements o f the deposit account, which will be audited
by the Auditor General o fNamibia.gThe Auditor-General carries out the audit basedon INTOSAI
standards, which i s acceptable to the World Bank. The audit report o f the deposit account will be
submitted to the World Bank and the participating development partners within six months from the end
o f each financial year. The Auditor General will also audit the financial statements o f the M o E and submit
these to Parliament within nine months from the end o f each financial year. The Auditor General will

                                           ENVIRONMENTAL      ASPECTS

 121. Consistent with OP8.60, the MoE has conducted backgroundstudies to assess potential
environmental and social impacts as aresult o fprogramactivities. The summary o f the environmental
assessment can be found inAnnex 10. To this end, an environmental and social management report
concluded that DPLl and the parent program(ETSP1) are not likely to have significant negative
environmental and social impacts, while supporting a variety o fpositive impacts such as an increasein
educational opportunities for the most marginalizedgroups, improved quality o f education, and poverty
reduction. Although highlyunlikely,potentialnegative impacts may arise from the construction ofnew
schools, Vocational Training Centers (VTCs), and the extension o f existing physical facilities and
associatedsanitary facilities. Giventhe availability of land, the locationof new schools should easily
avoid ecologically and socially sensitive sites. Students and communitieswill be involved inthe
implementation o f activities to address environmental and social concerns, usingthe advocacy services
for ETSIPl. School curricula already include environmental education. Namibia also has solid policy,
legal, and institutional frameworks that guide land acquisition. The Ministries of Agriculture, Water, and
Forestry and the RoadAuthority have solid experience inapplying these instruments. Inthe rare event
that it may benecessary, the MoE may tap on these experiencesto minimize any negative impacts. In
addition, the backgroundwork undertaken by the MoE has prepared it to respond appropriately.

                                         RISKS AND RISKMITIGATION

 122. This operationcouldbeprone to the following risks:

 123. Vulnerability to external shocks (Low): Although Namibia's critical sectors of the economy      -
mining, fisheries, tourism, and agriculture are vulnerable to external shocks, the country has a good
                                              -
track record of macroeconomic stability since independence in 1990. The riskthat fluctuations inthe
contributions of these sectors may underminemacroeconomic stability and the GRN's ability to sustain
its budget allocations to the sector i s therefore low. All the same, the GRNhasput a lot o f effort toward
raising grant financing required for up-front capital investment inthe sector. Inaddition, efficiency
measures instituted under ETSIPl should contribute to the sustainability of recurrent cost implications of
externally fundedcapital investment. Further,the MoE has developed base, medium, and highcask
scenarios for scaling ETSIP1activities up or down over the years, ifcompellingreasons arise.

124. Fiduciary risk (Low): Initial assessments of the GRN'sprocurement system identified the following
key risks: (i)inadequate MoE capacity to manageprocurement processes, which may leadto delayed
implementation; (ii)  the low threshold for prior review by the tender board, which may delay program
implementation; and (iii)  the applicationof price preferences withinnational competitive bidding infavor
of historically disadvantaged local companies, which can leadto inefficient use ofresources allocated for
ETSIP1.

125. These risks have beenaddressedthrough ongoing GRNprocurement reforms and through reforms
agreedwith the DPLl team. The MoE has agreedto strengthen its capacity. Key elements include the
establishment o f a dedicatedprocurement unito f the MoE; direct procurement training o f MoE staff; and
skills transfer through on-the-job training and coaching. The implementationo f these actions i s advanced.
The GRN's ongoingreforms ofthe Tender BoardAct allows for case-specific increasesofthe threshold
for prior review as implementationcapacity improves. This operation frontloads capacity development
actions to ensure that the MoE can progressively qualify for increasedthreshold basedon good
implementationtrack record. The progress so far by MoE toward addressingprior actions for DPLl
demonstratesthat the MoE's applicationfor increased prior-review threshold shouldnot encounter



                                                       25

problems. The Cabinet has also cleared a proposal to use ETSIPI as apilot for procurement practices that
will improvethe efficiency and transparency o fresource useand, it warranted, to take the pilotto scale
after a 2-year monitoring of its impact. To strengthen knowledge from the pilot, the GRNhas further
committed to support the World Bank and other development partners' joint undertaking o f a CIFA.
Relevant recommendations of the CIFA will be usedto further strengthen ongoing fiduciary reforms.

 126. Financial management (Low): Identifiedfinancial management risks are: (i)         the MoE's weak
budgetingcapacity and (ii) MoF's weak support and quality control of the audit function ofthe MoE
                             the
and other ministries.The first i s beingaddressedthrough substantial technical support to the MoE to
ensure the level of accuracy inbudgetingrequired under the GRN's integrated financial management
information system.

 127. Recent Bank assessmentsconcluded that the GRNprocurement and financial management systems
are adequatefor the delivery o f direct budget support. Fiduciary risks are rated low. Nonetheless, the
proposed CIFA would provide a comprehensive and integrated assessment o fNamibia's key fiduciary
risks inpublic expenditure management and procurement.

 128. Interest-based resistance toproposed policy reforms (Moderate): Some of the policy measures
supported by DPLl might encounter resistance from powerful interest groups, such as the teachers'
unions, wealthy parents, and civil servants. This i s particularly so for policies to improve the efficiency of
resource use and educators' accountability for student learning, delinkingteacher salary increasesfrom
irrelevant and not requiredqualifications, phasing out subsidies to profit-making private schools, and
placing all managerson time-bound performance contracts. The overall riski s rated as moderate. To
mitigate this risk, the GRNhas maintainedan inclusive consultative process with all key stakeholders.
Thishas engenderedbetter appreciation ofproposedpolicy reforms, as well asbroader support and
ownership. The GRNand the MoE have recently showndetermination to overcome pressuresfrom
interest groups with the recentreversal of the decision to hiketeacher entry salaries to unsustainable
levels and the MoE's signingof performance contracts with headquarters-basedsector managers.

129. Implementation delays due to consultations and consensus building (Low): A key cost of inclusive
consultations is delay inmalung critical decisions andthe resultant delay inprogramimplementation.But
the advantagesof inclusive consultation (ownership and broad-based support for the reforms) far
outweigh the disadvantages. Inaddition, the GRNhas substantially reducedthis riskby giving adequate
leadtime for consultations, starting inAugust 2004. Ithas also sustainedthe advocacy campaign for the
broader program ETSIP1 since 2004, helping to buildconsensusaround strategic policy reforms that
could have been controversial. The risk of implementation delays due to consensusbuildingi s low.
ETSIPI already enjoys a highlevel ofnational ownership and support.

130. Inadequate implementation capacity (Moderate): Mitigationmeasuresto improve implementation
capacity pertainto: (i) creating a policy, legal, and institutional environment that will facilitate program
implementation; (ii)  assessingprogramimplementation capacity and articulating a capacity development
sub-program; (iii)  frontloading capacity development actions; (iv) carefully sequencing activities to start
with those that arereadily implementable and that prepare for easier implementation downstream; (v)
articulating implementationarrangements and implementationplans; (vi) very detailed implementation
planning, procurement planning and disbursementplanningby the MoE; and (vii) clear system
performance monitoring and evaluation.

131. Potential discontinuity offinancial support by one of the 13 developmentpartners (Moderate to
high): The large number of development partners that will finance ETSIPI poses ariskthat some
pledged support couldbe discontinued duringthe five years ofprogramimplementation.This risk is rated



                                                       26

moderate, but couldbe highifthe withdrawing partner shouldbe a significant financier. To reduce this
risk, the GFWhasdeveloped mediumandlowcase scenariosfor scaling downETSIPl,inthe event of a
financial shortfall.

132. Adverse effects of HlV/MDSon sector performance (Moderate): Mitigationmeasures include: (i)
introducing substitute teachers usingthe national youth service and volunteers; (ii) curricula
                                                                                  more
mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS; (iii)   introducing conditional cash grants for OVCs; and (iv) strengthening
the HIV/AIDSmanagement unit (HAMU)of the Ministryandregional A I D S committees (RACE).

ETSIP in the Context of National Development Agenda

 Vision 2030

Namibia's Vision 2030, developed at the turn o f the Century, foresees Namibia becoming a
knowledge-based economy, achieving highincome levels, and greater social equity, through the
further development o fits humanandnatural resources.

Such accelerated economic growth implies improved productivity, which certainly requires an
alleviation o f the current shortage o f skilled workers and managers. ETSIP is the roadmap o f the
education and training sector to achieve the goals o f Vision 2030 and i s closely aligned with the
National Development Plans andthe medium term expenditure framework (MTEF).

Development of ETSIP

Considering the demands o f Vision 2030, the Government o f the Republic o fNamibiaturned its
attention to the education and training system.         Despite heavy investments (about 25% of
government spending) since independence in 1990, this sector is not yet delivering the expected
results. In 2002 the World Bank was therefore invited to undertake a critical analysis o f the
sector and to advise the government how to best improve the sector and transform it into a better
tool for supporting national development.

Confirming and deepening the findings o f other investigations, including the Presidential
Commission on Education, Culture and Training o f 1999, the World Bank study found that
Namibia's education system would indeed not deliver on the expectations o f Vision 2030,
particularly in terms o f quality, equity, relevance, and responsiveness to HIV and AIDS. The
findings and analysis inthe report, "Human Capital and Knowledge Developmentfor Economic
Growth with Equity" (2004) were used as starting point for the development o f a fifteen year
strategic framework.

An intensive planning process then ensued with the technical support World Bank, resulting, in
February 2005, inthe adoption by Cabinet o f the fifteen-year Strategic Plan for ETSIP, Planning
for a Learning Nation. The Strategic Planwas endorsed by Namibia's development partners and
stakeholders ineducation and training duringthe Round Table meeting held inMarch2005.

Itwas decided that ETSIP would be implemented inthree five-year phases. The first, from 2006
-2011,coincideswiththeThirdNationalDevelopmentPlan(NDP3). Itwasfurtherdecidedthat
the programme would be divided into sub-programmes and work commenced on the
development o f detailed 5-year implementation plans. The strategic plans and first drafts o f the
5-year plans were discussed with various stakeholders, including regional offices o f education,
teachers, members o f school managements, the teachers' unions, members o f regional
governance and educational for in all 13 regions to ensure ownership and collaboration.
Comments were incorporatedas far as possible.




                                                   29

A detailed planning process resulted in 2-year implementation plans and procurement plans and
the ETSIP Programme Document (2006 - 20011). The plans for first phase o f ETSIP were
subjected to a joint development partner pre-appraisal in March 2006 and a successful joint
appraisal inOctober 2006.

The development process was spearheaded by the ETSIP Task Team which consisted o f
representatives o f all the line ministries in the education and training sector, the Ministry o f
Finance and the National Planning Commission.             This team was replaced by the ETSIP
Programme Coordinating Committee, under the chairmanship o f the Permanent Secretary o f the
Ministryo f Education, inJuly 2006 after limited implementation o f the programme commenced
utilisinggovernment funding.

Strategic Objectives
Inthe development o fthe 15-year strategic plan, five main strategic objectiveswere identified:
        0   Quality/effectiveness
        0   Equityand Access
        0   Development relevance and Responsiveness
        0   Delivery Capacity andManagement
        0   Efficiency o f resource mobilisation and utilisation.
The set o f strategic objectives is common across the sub-programmes, but each sub-programme
has determined its own order o fpriority.

In addition to these objectives, a set of strategic objectives for the first phase of ETSIP were
determined. These are as follows:
        0   strengthening the supply o fmiddle to highlevel skilled labour
        0   improving the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of general education
            systematising knowledge andinnovation
            Improving the effectiveness andrelevance o fthe tertiary education system, and
            strengthening the policy and legal framework for access to lifelong learning.

These strategic objectives are pursued through nine Sub-programmes, for Early Childhood
Development and Pre-Primary Education, General Education, Vocational Education and
Training, Tertiary Education and Training, Knowledge Creation and Innovation, Information
Adult and Lifelong Learning, HIV and AIDS, ICTs, and Capacity Development. While the first
six sub-programmes are focused on specific areas in the education and.training sector, the last
three cover cross-cutting issues. This makes o f ETSIP a truly sector-wide approach.

Decisions on Policy and Institutional Strengthening

A number o f policy decisions have been made by Cabinet concerning ETSIP implementation,
including the following:
        adoption o f a national policy on HIV and AIDS for the education sector
        approval o f the policy on ICT inthe Education Sector




                                                 30

        transfer o f pre-primary education from the Ministry o f Gender Equality and Child
        Welfare to the Ministry o f Education
        approval o f the Vocational Education and Training Bill
        the establishment o f the NCHE (National Council for Higher Education)
        the establishment o fthe NTA (Namibia Training Authority), and
        the establishment o f ACTET (Advisory Council for Teacher Education and Training.



First Steps in Implementing ETSIP

InJune 2006 the GRNdecided to commence with the implementation of ETSIP, usingits own
resources, ahead o f the pledged contributions o f development partners becoming available.

During the period o f final development o f ETSIP and the first year o f implementation, the
following priority policy andinstitutional strengthening actions have been implemented:

Cabinet has approved a National Policy on HIV and AIDS for the education and training sector
and a unit has been established inthe Ministryo f Education to manage and coordinate HIV and
AIDS related activities. Regional AIDS Committees for Education have been set up in all
thirteen regions.

Cabinet also approved the Policy on ICT in the Education Sector. A division for ICTs has been
established inthe Ministryo f Education and a comprehensive initiative and implementation plan
for the introduction of ICTs in education, Tech ma!, (www.tech.na) has been launched by the Rt
Hon Prime Minster, bringing together some fifty partners in a national drive. The ICTs in
Education Steering Committee guides the work inthe sub-programme.

The policy to institute standardized achievement tests in grades 5 and 8 has also been approved
by Cabinet. The standards on core skills and competencies to be acquired during the lower
primaryphase (grades 1- 4) have beencompleted.

The Ministryo f Education has agreed to introduce per capita financing o f formal education with
effect from the 2007/8 financial year. The process has begun with the production o f a working
document which outlines the choices to be made and steps to be taken. A plan was developed
for establishing conditional grants for OVCs to ensure their successfbl completion o f general
education.

The process o f negotiations with the Office o f the Prime Minister and the teachers unions on
policy, targets and plans to increase the learner teacher ratio has started. The government i s also
preparingfor negotiations with the teachers union to increase class sizes, as the personnel budget
cannot sustain current levels.

National Standards for Schools have been established, and all schools have carried out a self-
evaluation interms o f these standards, resulting in a school-level development plan. Inaddition,




                                                 31

the Ministry o f Education has agreed to adopt a policy to introduce conditional grants for schools
that do not achieve determined levels in terms o f the national standards and performance
indicators. An evaluation team i s currently collecting data which will be used inthe allocation o f
conditional grants.      An operational plan for allocating theses grants to schools has been
developed.

National Standards for the Teaching Profession have been agreed, published and launched as a
prelude to the re-planning o f teacher education and the introduction o f teacher licensing. First
steps have been taken for the introduction o f a Performance Management System for staff
members. The Office o f the Prime Minister has agreed that the Ministry o f Education would be
one o f the first ministries for roll-out o f the system.

Thebroad curriculum for schools has been reviewed anda consultative documentprepared.

Additional space has been built (and i s being built) to increase the intake into senior secondary
education in 2007. Additional text books have been purchased for grade 10 in2007. . A plano f
action for the pro-poor expansion o f enrolment in high quality senior secondary schools was
developed together with an operational planfor the establishment o f six `comprehensive' schools
inthe most disadvantaged regions.

The Vocational Training Billis about to be tabled inthe National Assembly. This will officially
establish a National Training Authority, which already exists as a project, and has brought about
considerable reform towards a competency-based vocational education system supported by a
training levy. The standards, curricula andmaterials for several trades have been developed.

A National Council for Higher Education has been established to coordinate higher education
and especially its funding and quality. Preparations have been made to appoint a dedicated
Secretariat o f the Council. Permission has been granted by the Public Service Commission to
advertise and fill the positions for the Secretariat on contract. The Advisory Council for Teacher
Education and Training has been established and has appointed a task force to drive teacher
education reform.

Cabinet has approved the transfer o fpre-primaryeducation from the Ministry o f Gender Equality
and Child Welfare to the Ministry o f Education. A unit has been established in the National
Institute for Education Development to commence with the preparation o f a curriculum,
materials andtraining for pre-primary education. This unit started its work early inJanuary 2007.

Much attention has recently been given to improved procurement. The education and training
sector has established a Procurement Unit for ETSIP. Three training sessions were held to
prepare administrative and professional staff for the task ahead. The procurement plans were
finalised and aligned with the implementation plans and ETSIP Programme Document.
Agreement has also been reached on the carrying out o f a CIFA.

A new relationship has been established with the private sector. The first result o f this is a
management development project inthe remote Kunene region to improve the performance o f a




                                                     32

cluster o f schools with a lacklustre record. Other public-private partnerships are in the pipeline
for diverse projects like improved performance in mathematics and rentable rural teacher
housing. A public-private partnership to provide free exercise books to all learners in Namibia
started inJanuary 2007 and 1millionjotters have already been distributed to all regions.

With regard to improving education equity, quality and efficiency, a plan has been agreed for a
phased increase o f the budget share for books and teaching and learning materials relative to
salaries.

Upfront actions to improve efficiency include an agreed plan for improving key internal
efficiency indicators -repetition, dropouts, learner teacher ratio and the use ofphysical space.

Conclusion

IhopethatthiswillindicatetoyoutherealitythatETSIPhasbecomeahighprofilenational
cause to which the government and many partners are fully committed as a matter o f urgency.
ETSIP has become the flagship programme o f the Government o f the Republic of Namibia and
there is strong national ownership and support for its implementation which will improve the
education and training system and result in higher economic growth, employment creation and
poverty alleviation andhelp Namibia to leap frog into a knowledge based economy.

Finally, Ishould like to inform you that the high regard in which ETSIP is currently held is in
large measure due to the untiringefforts o f Dr MmantsetsaMarope and her team. We therefore
look forward to a continuing relationship with the World Bank.

                  ANNEX 5: ETSIPl IMPLEMENTATIONARRANGEMENTS

         Consistent with principles o f direct budget support, E T S P1will be implementedthrough
regular GRN structures. The capacity o f core implementing structures (MoE headquarters) was
assessedand key weaknesses that pose implementationrisks were identified. The results o f the
assessment were used to develop a capacity development sub-program o f ETSIPl.In addition, GRN

                         ANNEX 9: POVERTYAND SOCIALIMPACT

1.     The Grin'spolicy and legal frameworks recognize the needfor equitable accessto good
  quality education and training. InDecember 2001, Parliament passedan Act that provides for
  accessible, equitable, qualitative, and democratic national education service. The Act provides for
  the establishment ofvarious educational boards and advisory councils as well as education funds.
  Further,it specifies learner admission andrules ofconduct; identifies coursesof study,
  examinations, and certificates; establishes cultural institutions; supports pre-primary education;
  and addresses adult literacy.

2.    'TheEducationAct ofOctober 2002complements theDecember2001Actwithregardsto
  school boards, school funds, and learner conduct. The Act also addressedhostels at state schools,
  established culture service points, and addressedstandards inprivate schools.

3.     The former Ministry ofBasic Education, Sport, and Culture developedaNationalPolicy
  Options for Educationally MarginalizedChildren (2000). This policy furtherrecognizes the need
  for equitable access to quality education. The policy identified 11groups, listedbelow, as being
  marginalized. Some identified factors of disadvantage include: poverty and consequently,
  unaffordable education services; parents' disempowerment to effectively support their children's
  schooling; and physical inaccessibilityof education services due to distance from school.

4.     Other than policy and legal instruments, the overall national development outlook emphasizes
  the needto redressNamibia's acute social and income inequalities. Inthis regard, the
  redistributive effects of education and training are highlyrecognizedas the core of the social
  equity strategy. This i s expressedinVision 2030, National DevelopmentPlans, and the National
  Poverty Action Plan, among others.

5.     Some analyses identify constraints to the realization of social equity through education and
  training opportunities. InJanuary 2003, the former Ministry of Basic Education, Sport, and
  Culture, with support from UNICEF, commissioned a study on marginalized children titled
  "Educationally Marginalized ChildreninNamibia: An inventory o f Programs, Interventions, and
  Data." Findingso f this study were to guide the preparation o f action plans for addressing
  educational needs of marginalizedchildren as well as to provide data to monitor improvements.
  In2005, theWorldBankpublishedareportthat recommendedsubstantialreductionof
  inequalities ineducation inputsand outcomes as a necessary step toward poverty reduction and
  social equity.

6.     Against this background, DPLl supports GRNpolicies that promote equity inthe distribution
  of education inputsand outcomes. This i s to be attained through cluster of policy measures on
  per-capita financing, quota systemfor admission to senior secondary school, setting performance
  standards and inputnorms for schools, providing disadvantaged schools conditional grants to
  meet inputnorms and performance standards, providingconditional grants to enable effective
  participation o f Voss, and establishing highquality schools indisadvantaged areas. An underlying
  premise of the entire ETSIP program i s to expand equal opportunities for education and training.
  The programis pro-poor inits overall orientationand its sequencing of critical actions.

7.     Indigenous Peoples and Vulnerable Groups: Ina country still findingits way after apartheid,
  there i s hesitance withinthe Moe to separate groups along ethnic lines. Insteadthe Moe views all
  citizens as Namibians. Within this context, however, the Moe recognizes there are uniqueneeds
  among vulnerable groups. To this end, the Moe identified 11groups as being marginalized. These
  includechildren of farm workers, Sanchildren, Ovahimba children, street children and working


                                                 82

   children, children in squatter areas and resettlement camps, mentally and physically impaired
   childredchildren with special educational needs, over-aged children accordingto existing
   policies, teenage school learners as workers, young offenders, refugee children, and orphans and
   abandonedchildren.

8.     O fthese groups, San are considered indigenous by World Bank standards. The Sanpeople
   have historically been exploited by other ethnic groups. The Government has taken a number of
   measuresto endthis societal discrimination against the San, including seeking their advice about
   proposed legislation on communally heldlands and increasing their access to primary education.
   By law all indigenous groups are able to participate equally indecisions affectingtheir land,
   cultures, traditions, and allocation of naturalresources.Nevertheless, the San and other
   marginalizedNamibianshave been unable to exercise these rights fully as a result of historically
   minimal access to education and economic opportunities, coupled with their relative isolation in
   remote areas.

9.     Wanting to recognize all citizens equally as Namibians, the MoE does acknowledge that
   marginalizedgroups need assistanceat the initial stages o f learninginorder to perform at an
   equal level with more advantaged groups. As a result, the MoE provided assistanceto selected
   students from marginalizedgroups to attend secondary schools. This includedproviding added
   learning support so that the students could successfully complete grade 10.Many o f these
   studentsthen completed grade 12 and returned to their home communities to serve as teachersto
   lower primary students. A negative aspect o f this, however, is that these teacherswere not
   properly certified and thus their upwardcareer mobility and associatedbenefits are limited.

10.    TheMoEhas already taken steps towards addressingthe unique educational needsof
   disadvantaged groups. These include establishing a variety o fnon-traditional learning
   opportunities such as satellite schools basedon the seasonalmovements o f indigenous peoples
   and mobile schools for cattle-herders, which enable the movement associatedwith grazing
   without interrupting children's schooling. To address the circumstances o f farm workers' children
   the MoE createdsmaller schools. The MoEnowrecognizes orphansare anew group of
   disadvantaged children withunique needsand challenges that will need to be addressedinthe
   immediate future.To this effect ETSIPl includedactions that are targeted to OVCs such as the
   establishment of conditional grants for their effective participation and successful completion o f
   their education.

11.    The MoE also takes prideinhavingsupportedthe creation ofan orthography for one ofthe
   San language groups, which has allowed the MoE to create instructionalmaterials for lower
   primary students who can thenbe taught intheir mother-tongue. This orthography, however,
   covers only one o f the San ethnic groups, which leavesa largemajority of San children without
   access to primary education intheir mother-tongue.

12.    Finally, Namibia is the first country in Southern Africa to provide national radio broadcasts in
   San languages. To date, a minimal amount o f education opportunities have tapped radio
   broadcastsas a learningtool. However, due to the positive feedback from San o fhearingtheir
   mother-tongue broadcast has encouragedthe MoE to develop an EducationalRadio Project. It i s
   hopedthat this will further expose and promote the value o f formal learning opportunities. To
   support this initiative, various organizations have furnished solar-powered radios to San
   communities.

13.    Construction of learningcenters inareas that have a large Sanpopulation will allow students
   to attend schools located closer to their homes andprovide themwith a better learning support


                                                  83

   system. Currently, many San studentsmustlive on school campuseslocatedfar from their homes
   and fame many hardships-nominal        exposure to their cultural heritage, minimal or no social
   support structure, isolation, and sometimes, inappropriate treatment from their peers as well as
   staff.

14.     Although faced with abject poverty, constrained access to education opportunities, minimal
   social support, and low literacy rates, parents-including   Sanparents-have     a strong desire to
   sendtheir childrento school inthe hopesthat their children will have the opportunities that are
   open to those with an educational degree. Several constraints, such as language, income, and
   school locations, prevent many San childrenfrom successfdly participating ineducation. To
   identify ways inwhich marginalizedgroups canparticipateand benefit from thisprogram, the
   ministryprepared an Indigenous PeoplesandVulnerable Groups DevelopmentReport.

15.    Educationally Marginalized Children in Namibia: An inventory o f Programs, Interventions,
   and Data and the Indigenous Peoplesand Vulnerable Groups Report along with the National
   Policy Options for Educationally MarginalizedChildren, prepared by the Ministry of Basic
   Education, Sport, and Culture in2000, provide a foundationby which the MoE can provide
   supportive interventions and increase inclusionof previouslyneglected groups such as inviting
   representatives of marginalizedgroups to participate insteering committees within the MoE.

16.    Land Acquisition: It is possible that land will needto be acquired for the construction of
   schools, VTCs, and learning centers. Theoretically, this acquisition may negatively impactpeople
   currently occupying or usingthe land. It is expected, however, that land can be identified which
   would not have significant negative impact on individuals or communities.

17.    The Constitution ofNamibiaprovides for administrationof landinNamibia to beby
   Statutory Law, generally applied to urban areas, and Customary Law, usually appliedto rural and
   communal lands. Three relevant Namibian policies with regards to land include:

   0   National Resettlement Policy (2001) aims primarily to improve the living standards of all
       Namibians. The policy stipulates that resettlement is voluntary and does not address issues of
       program-induced resettlement.
   0   National Lands Policy (1998) promotes the sustainable use of land as a naturalresource.
   0   Land-use Planning: Towards Sustainable Development (1994) addresses issuesrelatedto
       land tenure. The objective i s to encourage the rational and integrated planning of land use
       basedon sound ecologicalprinciples inrural areas and establish suitable participatory
       structures to enable communitiesto participate indecision making and take responsibility for
       the management of resources on the landthey occupy.

18.    To mitigate the negative impacts which may result from land acquisition due to construction,
   MoE prepared a Resettlement Framework (RF). The RFprovides guidance and standards to
   follow incases where programactivities result inlandacquisition, impacts assets, and/or
   negatively impacts livelihood. The fi-amework indicates actions that would identify stakeholders,
   guide valuation procedures, and identifycompensation measures as well as grievance
   mechanisms for those impactedby program activities.

19.    Gender: Assessments by the MoEindicatethat gender does not play a major factor inschool
   participation. Insome cases, it has been notedthat boys are less likely to attend school than girls;
   therefore the program focuses on all childrenwithin identifiedvulnerable groups regardless of
   gender.



                                                  84

20.    Participation: Consultations occurred inthe course o fpreparingthe Environment and
   Resettlement Frameworksand the Indigenous Peoples and Vulnerable Groups Report which
   included stakeholders, representative Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and Community-
   based Organizations (CBOs), relevant ministries and government agencies. Due to the fact that
   site locations were unknown duringthe preparation o f the program, site specific consultations
   could not occur. Once potential site locations are identified, environmental and social impacts
   will be identified and stakeholders directly impactedby programactivities will be consulted as
   well as provided an opportunity to participate inprogram activities.

21.    Namibian laws and World Bank standards and best practice recommendthat all activities
   impacting the public include consultation with stakeholders prior to, and during, program
   implementation. It i s also expected that capacity buildingefforts built into program design will
   increase participation inthe education process such as increasedparticipation inschool boards
   which includes community members, parents, and students.




                                                 85

               ANNEX 10: ENVIRONMENTASPECTSAND REQUIREMENTS

1.    The GRNhas enactedan EnvironmentalAssessment Policy (1994-95). The policy supports
  GRN's goal of sustainable development andpromotingeconomic growth while also protectingits
  fragile environment. It states that the principleof achieving and maintaining sustainable
  development must underpinall policies, programs, and projects undertaken withinNamibia. To
  this end,the GRNwill adopt policiesaimed at the maintenance ofecosystems, essential
  ecologicalprocessand biological diversity of Namibia and utilization of livingnaturalresources
  on a sustainablebasis for the benefit of all Namibians, bothpresent and future.

2.    The programwill involve the rehabilitation and construction of schools, VTCs, andlearning
  centers. Due to these activities, the MoE preparedbothan Environmental and Social Management
  Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Framework (RF) which compared national laws with
  World Bank policies. The ESMF and RF identifiedpotential environment and social impacts,
  provided mitigation measures for potential negative impacts, and discussedways inwhich to
  engage stakeholders. As many program activities will occur inregionsknown to include San
  among the targeted groups, an Indigenous Peoples and Vulnerable Groups DevelopmentReport
  was also prepared.

3.    It i s expected that program activities involving rehabilitation and/or constructionwill be
  small insize and number, be locatedinpreviously neglectedremote areas inthe northernportion
  of the country, and have minor negative impacts, all of which can be mitigated. Significant efforts
  will bemade inthe design and screening stages ofprogramactivities to avoid negative impacts
  on people, property, and livelihood. A number of positive impacts will result from the program
  suchas increasedaccess to education, higherquality ofteaching standards, anda decrease in
  poverty.

4.    Main Features of the ESMF. The ESMF consists of a set of mitigation measures, monitoring
  indicators, and institutionalarrangements to be taken duringconstruction, rehabilitation, and
  implementationofprogramactivities inorder to eliminate adverse environmentaland social
  impacts, or reduce and mitigate impacts where negative impacts are unavoidable, and increase
  positive impacts. Ifit is determined that land acquisitionwill involve relocation o fpeople or
  impact their livelihood then land acquisition will commence following the guidelines set out in
  the resettlement framework. It i s not expected that program activities will have significant
  negative environmental or social impacts.

5.    Once construction sites are identified, an Environmental Impact Assessment and
  Environmental Management Plan (EMP) will be prepared inaccordance with Namibian law and
  following the guidance of World Bankpolicy. The EMP will provide a specific description of
  institutional arrangements- who i s responsible for carrying out the mitigation and monitoring
  measures.Additionally, the EMP will include an estimate of the costs of these measuresand
  activities recommended so that the program can budget the necessaryfunds.

6.    Monitoring: Environmental and social monitoring will be conducted duringconstruction,
  rehabilitation, and operation inorder to measure the success of the mitigation measures.
  Monitoring results for all environmentaland social issues will be includedas a part of the
  programreporting procedures.

7.    IndigenousPeoples:An initial assessment was conducted duringpreparation to determine
  support for ETSIP among indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples andrepresentative NGOswere
  contacted, all of whom expressedpositive attitudes towards increased educational opportunities


                                                  86

   for marginalizedgroups. Discussions identified factors that contribute to increasedhardships with
   regards to education: language constraints, marginalization, discrimination from other students
   and staff, financial difficulties, and distance students must travel from their homes, which leads to
   an absence o f an effective support system. An increasednumber o f educational facilities in
   previously neglected areas were seen as a positive step towards addressing some o f these
   constraints.

8.     The Government o fNamibia, through the Ministryo fEducation, conducted andprepared an
   Indigenous Peoples and Vulnerable Groups Development Report that examined boththe positive
   and negative impacts from program activities. The report recommends measures to prevent,
   minimize and mitigate any adverse impact as well as identified ways to increase participation o f
   and benefits to indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups. Duringpreparation, indigenous
   peoples and members from vulnerable, marginalized, and disadvantaged groups were consulted to
   ensure these groups supported the program goals and activities that had a direct and indirect
   impact on them. The report also recommendedways that marginalizedpeoples can become more
   active inthe programprocess as well as inthe educational process o fNamibia. Byutilizing this
   report the Ministryplans to integrate recommendations to further develop positive ETSIP
   outcomes.

9.     Land Acquisition:The Government o fNamibia, through the Ministryo f Education, wants to
   minimize negative social impacts with regards to the buildingof school facilities. To this end, the
   Ministryprepareda framework to be followed incaseswhere landwas neededfor construction.
   The framework established standards and procedures to be followed, where land acquisition was
   required or assets would be impacted, before any civil works activities can begin.

10.    These background studies, reports, and frameworks indicate the Ministry'spreparedness to
   address and reduce negative environmental and social impacts and work towards increasing
   positive outcomes within ETSIP activities and have provided a strong foundation from which to
   move forward.

On January 5, 2007 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation withNamibia."

Background

Growth i s expected to increase to 4% percent in 2006, after 4% percent in 2005, due in part to a
recovery in diamond production. Rising oil prices and interest rates have not yet noticeably affected
activity. Though rising, inflation i s expected to remainmoderate. The external current account surplus
i s expected to double to close to 14 percent of GDP in 2006, thanks to record diamond exports and a
surge in customs union (SACU) receipts. However, continued outflows of capital to South African
financial markets have kept internationalreserves relatively low. Consistent with the peg to the rand,
the Bank of Namibia has matched recent interest rate increasesby the South African Reserve Bank,
liftingratesby 2 percentagepoints in2006.

The fiscal deficit fell by close to 7 percentagepoints duringthe last two fiscal years, to %percent of
GDP in 2005/06. While windfall revenues are expected to lead to a small budget surplus in2006/07,
the underlyingfiscal position is set to weaken. Namibia will receive a 5 percent of GDP windfall in
SACU revenues in 2006/07, the largest portion of which will be directed towards increased
expenditures. As a result of the recent fiscal consolidation, Namibia's public debt ratio is projectedto


"  UnderArticle IVofthe IMF'sArticles ofAgreement, the IMFholds bilateral discussions with
members,usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters,the staffprepares a report, which forms the basis for discussionby the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the ManagingDirector, as Chairmanof the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary i s transmitted to the country's
authorities.


                                                     88

come close to the authorities' fiscal rule target o f 25 percent o f GDP by 2007/08.Nonetheless, public
debt i s poised to rise again over the medium term in light o f an expected decline in SACU receipts
and an increase in spending to address Namibia's development needs, unless reforms are undertaken
to shore uprevenues and reduce non-priority spending.




Namibia faces a number o f economic and social challenges over the medium term. Economic growth
remains volatile and depends on mining, and Namibia also has highrates o f poverty, unemployment,
and HIV/AIDSinfection.

ExecutiveBoard Assessment

Directors commended the authorities for following prudent macroeconomic policies that had
contributed to robust growth, moderate inflation, and large external surpluses. At the same time,
economic and social challenges remain, and focus needs to be placed on broadening the economic
base and raising Namibia's long-term growth potential. Directors welcomed the progress made in
implementing reforms to reduce poverty, unemployment, and high rates o f HIV/AIDS infection. A
reform o f the education system has been launched, a sound HIV/AIDS strategy i s in place, and an
Anti-Corruption Commission has been established to promote governance and private sector
development. However, additional efforts are needed to ensure an efficient and more flexible labor
market and to further support the business environment.

Directors stressed the importance o f prudent fiscal policies and increases in international reserves to
preserve macroeconomic stability, and welcomed the fiscal consolidation efforts o f the past two
years. In this context, they recalled the authorities' commendable efforts to reduce public debt.
However, noting the loosening o f the underlying fiscal stance in 2006107, several Directors
considered that a larger part o f expected revenue windfalls could have been devoted to reducing
public debt, especially given the projected medium-term decline in Southern African Customs Union
revenues and the future plans to increase development and pro-poor spending. Directors underlined
that a poverty reduction program, if established, should be targeted and not compromise hard-won
fiscal sustainability.

Directors welcomed the progress made in boosting VAT and income tax receipts through private
sector-led audits, but considered that fwther efforts to raise revenues are needed. To sustain tax
collections, VAT administration and the audit capacity o f the Inland Revenue Department should be
strengthened, and a large taxpayers' office established.



Directors encouraged the authorities to limit the growth o f public wage expenditures and develop a
strategy to determine the appropriate structure, quality, and remuneration level for the civil service.
They welcomed the authorities' commitment to reform state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and urged
them to take the necessary steps to make the new SOE Governance Act effective.

Directors agreed that the Namibia dollar's peg to the South African rand remains appropriate. To


                                                      89

strengthen foreign reserves and help keep domestic savings in the country inthe long term, Directors
recommended developing domestic investment opportunities and market-based strategies-such            as
asset securitization and open market purchases o f foreign exchange. Most Directors counseled against
regulatory measures to stem capital outflows, although a few others considered that such measures
could be useful on a short-term and temporary basis.

Directors commended the authorities for implementing recommendations o f the 2005 Financial
