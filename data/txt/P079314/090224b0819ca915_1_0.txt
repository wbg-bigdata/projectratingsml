                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The original and the (first) Additional Financing credit are closed and the Second Additional Financing will close on March 31, 2013. The most important projects outputs are as
                         follows:
                         �        The first component of the Project mobilized and trained communities to plan for their own development and to select and carry-out their own small-scale infrastructure sub-
                         projects. A consultants’ report confirms that the Project delivered good quality training and that community participation was substantive. The component made grants to help
                         communities to build their sub-projects. Drawing on all sources of financing, the component supported 852 sub-projects, compared to a target of 596 --covering half the settlements
                         in the country. The project unit drew on a separate EU grant to build 43 water-management sub-projects.
                         �        The second component piloted local delivery of social care services, with co-financing from a SIDA grant. This supported planning at the raion (district) level, trained staff,
                         and established social care service centers in 31 communities. The project unit drew on a separate EU grant to build a further 30 social care service centers. Drawing on the pilots,
                         the Government began a national network of local social care services. To sustain the pilots, the role of the Ministry of Labor, Social Protection and Family is to supervise operations
                         of the social care centers while the raions should budget adequate funding.
                         �        The third component supported building of community capacity to influence policy at the national level, evaluation studies, and the management & information system.
                         Importantly, the component funded two evaluation studies to give insights into project results.
