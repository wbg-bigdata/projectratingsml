TECHNICAL ANNEX 1/
SECTION A: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1. BACKGROUND
1.          Introduction and Overview. China's fiscal system has come under stress
over the reform period since 1978. The reforms initiated a major shift of the tax base
away from the sectors traditionally tapped by the tax system, and government revenues
declined from over 34 percent of GNP in 1978 to less than 16 percent in 1993. Tax
buoyancy was undermined by loose collection and tax exemptions that were induced by
intergovernmental fiscal contracts, and facilitated by the decentralized tax administration
system. The reduced budgetary resources were handled by a budget system that was still
geared toward financing the State Plan, and a proliferation of extra- and off-budget funds
increasingly undermined the macro- and microeconomic functions of the budget.
2.           Against this backdrop, China's authorities have recently introduced sweeping
reforms of their fiscal policies and practices, which the proposed project would support.
The reforms were endorsed in the "Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the Fourteenth
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" in November 1993. The reforms
can be broadly divided into four parts: (a) a major overhaul of the tax system; (b) the
creation of separate tax administrations for central and shared taxes (National Tax Service,
NTS) and local taxes (the Local Tax Service, LTS); (c) a restructuring of
intergovernmental fiscal relations; and (d) the passing of an organic Budget Law. This
section presents the reforms and their background in more detail.
Key Issues in Fiscal Policy
3.           Tax Policy. China's tax structure has become increasingly incapable of
raising sufficient revenues.  At the beginning of the reform  period, the decline in
government revenues was mainly caused by increased independence of state-owned
enterprises (SEs), which were no longer obliged to submit all their profits to the budget.
In 1984, a separation of taxes and profits was established with the introduction of SE
income taxes. Increased competition from the nonstate sector rapidly eroded both profits
I/  This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission in January 1995, consisting of Zafer Ecevit
(Chief, EA2CO, mission leader), Bert Hofian (Economist, EA2CO; Task Manager), and Ike
Ikamuullah (Senior Technology Specialist, IENTI). The appraisal mission cooperated with a parallel
IMF mission, consisting of: Carlos Silvani (Advisor, mission leader), John Brondolo (Tax Systems
Information Officer), Tony Pellechio (Economist, IMF), and Alan Landsberg (Panel Expert).

and taxes from SEs. The buoyancy of the tax system was further undermined by the
contracting of profits and taxes between government and SEs since 1988, and the practice
of debt repayment deduction from taxes. These practices also provided the impetus for
strongly procyclical SE behavior, and recurrent excess investment demand. Furthermore,
tax contracting distorted competition among SEs, as the terms of their contract depended
on the financial strength of their local government. In the early 1990s the practice of tax
contracting was increasingly extended to the turnover taxes, eroding further the tax share
in GDP.
4.          Competition was further distorted by the complexity of the tax system,
which, despite a number of reforms, had 33 taxes, a multitude of rates for every tax, and
high marginal statutory tax rates on enterprise income, that varied by ownership. The
turnover taxes-mainly business tax, value added tax (VAT), and product tax-had a
myriad of rates, in part to compensate for the incomplete price reforms, and in part to
penalize "undesirable" consumption. The VAT, introduced in 1984, was gradually
extended to more products and sectors, and by 1993 had become the main revenue source
(Attachment 2).
5.          Tax Administration. Until recently, the decentralized tax administration
acted on behalf of both central and local governments. In principle, the tax administration
was under the "dual leadership" of local governments and the State Administration of
Taxation (SAT), the central tax authorities. SAT was established in 1988. Before that,
the administration was a department under the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The tax
administration is large by any international standard, with over 30,000 offices at four levels
(Table 1).2/  The district/county-level offices have primary responsibility for the tax
collection at larger enterprises, whereas tax collection stations focus on small enterprises.
Total personnel is now over 600,000, and is rising fast. The collection of taxes on
imported goods is delegated to Customs, and the agricultural taxes are collected by Finance
Bureaus. SAT has two training colleges, with about 400 teachers, mostly specialized in
basic tax theory.
6.          Over the 1980s and early 1990s, tax administration has increasingly become
an arm of local government. To attract investment, local government granted legal and
illegal tax exemptions, which contributed to the lack of buoyancy in tax revenue, and
central revenue in particular. Besides such political pressures, the tax administration has
faced a growing number of taxpayers, now amounting to 33 million, with over 1 billion
of transactions with taxpayers annually. The administration increasingly failed to manage
these numbers, despite the growth in the number of tax administrators. Efficiency has
been hampered by the lack of specialization of tax administrators, the concentration on tax
assessment and collection, instead of audit, and by the widespread system of "resident' tax
administrators in enterprises, which encourages a negotiated approach to paying taxes.
Moreover, the tax administration practices differed from locality to locality, distorting
competition, and undermining equality.
Z/ The tax collection station falls directly under the city/prefectural level, and is considered a branch of
that level.

/a SAT reported that total personnel exceeded 600,000 by mid-1994.
7.          China has made tax computerization efforts since 1986, with investments of
over $150 million in about 5,000 offices. There are some 4,000 technicians working in
the administration, and over 20,000 operators.  Most of the computer applications
developed have been less than fully effective because they concentrated on computerizing
existing procedures instead of first reforming the tax administration procedures to increase
overaUl efficiency. Moreover, the computerization that took place has not been coordinated
centrally, leading to a proliferation of systems and procedures among localities.
Computerization of some administrative functions was further hindered by the absence of
unique taxpayer's identification numbers (TlNs).
8.          Intergovermnental Fscal Relations.  China's intergovernmental fiscal
relations have changed considerably during the reform period. The most fundamental
change occurred in 1980, when the principle of "eating from separate kitchens" was
introduced, giving local governments more autonomy over their fiscal affairs by means of
what amounted to a contracting system. The fiscal contracts were formalized in 1988.
The contract system assigned taxes and tax shares to either central or local government.
The excess of local revenues over 1987 "base number" expenditures was to be remitted to
the central government according to a contracted rate, and a shortfall of revenues over
1987 expenditures was financed by a transfer from the center. The contracted local
retention rates were high, and bolstered local revenues in times of high growth and
inflation. In addition to the contracted revenues, local governments received a number of
earmarked transfers, predominantly for covering losses of SEs and for price subsidies.
9.          The intergovernmental fiscal arrangements gave local governments high
incentives for promoting growth, but also caused central tax buoyancy to decline. The
decline in tax buoyancy-accelerated by legal and illegal tax exemptions-hampered central
government's control over total budgetary expenditures, and reduced its role in equalization
among provinces. The contract system added to the procyclical tendencies of China's
economy, as the budget rules allowed local governments to spend their actual revenues,
which were higher in times of boom and lower in times of growth recessions. Revenue

assignments also introduced distortions in investment behavior by local governments.
Local shares in the product taxes encouraged investment in those industries that were
meant to be discouraged.
10.         Budget System. China's budgetary system has been an efficient resource
mobilizer for the Plan, but the system has not kept up with the reforms in the rest of the
economy, and is insufficiently equipped for its emerging role as an allocation and
macroeconomic stabilization instrument. The budget no longer fully reflects the fiscal
responsibility of the government, due to a proliferation of extra- and off-budget funds that
remain outside budget controls. The budget classification system is less suited for policy
analysis, cost computation, and for internal management. The budget compilation process
is largely incremental, projections are less than accurate, and the control over outlays is
weak, which contributes to economic cycles and weakens allocation through the budget.
The effectiveness of audits is restricted by lack of detail in the budget classification and
reporting procedures.
11.         The People's Bank of China (PBC) treasury department manages the vault
function well, and once in the treasury accounts, money is transferred relatively efficiently.
However, cash management has not been fully developed since the treasury had until
recently access to funding from PBC for short-term needs. Expenditure control, which
should be exercised by the MOF-Budget Department, suffers from lack of a detailed budget
and lack of an efficient information system. Capital budgeting techniques are hardly
present in the MOF and Finance Bureaus, as the public investment process used to be
handled largely by the State Planning Commission (SPC). Planning and budgeting are
virtually separated, as most of the public investments are handled by SPC, and recurrent
costs of the investments have increasingly been funded from extrabudgetary sources.
Recent Reforms
12.         The decline in the share of government revenues in GNP and central share
in the revenues in particular caused loss of macroeconomic control, because government
expenditures were not reduced in line, but were increasingly financed through policy
lending of the banking system. This loss of macroeconomic control led to sweeping
reforms in financial and fiscal policies and institutions that were announced in November
1993. The fiscal reforms are aimed at halting the decline of government revenues through
tax and tax administration reforms, and a gradual centralization of the revenues through
a rearrangement of intergovernmental fiscal relations. The Budget Law, which passed the
National People's Congress (NPC) in March 1994, should lead to better control over
expenditures.
13.         Tax Policy. The reforms announced at the beginning of 1995 aim for a
major restructuring of the tax system, which reduces the number of taxes from over 30 to
18, and greatly improves the overall structure (Attachment 3). The main reforms consist
of: (a) a broadening of the VAT to include parts of the Product Tax and Business Tax,
a reduction of the rates to two (17 and 13 percent) and a switch to the credit invoice
method; (b) a unification of the EIT for all domestic enterprises, with a standard rate of



33 percent,3/ and the abolition of tax contracting and debt principal repayment
deduction; (c) abolition of the Energy and Transportation Tax and the Budget Adjustment
Tax for SEs; and (d) a unification of the PIT. Various minor taxes are or will be merged
or abolished, the Resource Tax will be expanded, and a Securities Trading Tax will be
introduced.
14.         The State Council has assigned MOF principal responsibility for the
formulation of tax policy while SAT will concentrate more on tax administration. The
provinces have gained a very limited autonomy in setting rates for certain business taxes,
and the authorities are considering the possibility of gradually extending this autonomy.
15.         Over the first seven months of 1994, revenues from  industrial and
commercial taxes (including VAT, Consumption Tax and EIT) grew at about 30 percent
in nominal terms over the same period in 1993. However, overall budgetary revenues
grew only by 18 percent, thus still lagging behind nominal GNP growth. The authorities
realize that further tax reforms will be necessary to reverse the decline in government's
revenue share in GNP.
16.         Tax Administration.  To implement the tax reforms and the new
intergovernmental fiscal relations, China's authorities intend to fundamentally reform the
tax administration. The tax administration will be reorganized in NTS and LTS. SAT is
the headquarters for NTS, but also has responsibility for guiding LTS. As of July 1, 1994,
NTS collects all central taxes and shared taxes, amounting to the bulk of all taxes. The
split of NTS and LTS has now been enacted in all 30 provinces. NTS will retain about
350,000 personnel, the rest remaining in the local tax bureaus.
17.         With the help of technical assistance (TA) from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), a reform strategy and an implementation plan have been drafted.4/ The
strategy for reforms rests on: (a) a gradual move to self-assessment; (b) increased reliance
on tax advisors outside the administration; (c) increased computerization; and (d) a
strengthening of taxpayer information. SAT has decided to reform its procedures and the
internal organization of the offices, in line with the core tax administration functions
(registration; collection and accounting; audit and inspection; and taxpayer's information).
The district level will be the focus of computerization, but in the long run, SAT plans a
national system, with city-level and national-level processing capacity as well.
18.         Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations. The reforms in intergovemmental
fiscal relations will gradually increase central government's share in budgetary revenues.
The new system assigns most taxes to either central government or to local govemment.
The VAT and the Securities Trading Tax (to be introduced) are shared between central and

not for nonstate enterprises.

provincial government, with central shares of 75 and 50 percent, respectively. Offshore
resource taxes accrue to central government and other resource taxes to provincial
government. Central govemment's revenue share will gradually increase to about 60
percent of revenues, from about 40 percent in 1993. However, provinces are guaranteed
the 1993 level of revenues, and the new system will be gradually phased in, starting with
the increase in shared taxes over the 1993 level. The incremental revenues that will build
up at the central-government level is to be distributed to provincial governments by means
of a grant system. Until such a system is designed and approved, extra central revenues
from the VAT and Consumption Tax are in part returned to the provinces, predominantly
on a derivation basis.
19.         The State Council has established a Working Group to prepare a conceptual
design of a central-provincial grants scheme by June 1995. The Group, consisting of
MOF, Systems Reform Commission (SRC) and SAT officials, builds on technical
assistance by IMF, and is currently exploring a scheme that takes both revenue capacity
and expenditure needs into account. A "standard budget approach" used by Australia is
currently under study. The Group's efforts are supported by a Japanese Policy and Human
Resource Development (PHRD) grant, which finances regular visits of experts for
workshops on various aspects of the grants scheme design. After the State Council has
approved the conceptual design next year, the Budget Department of MOF is to develop
a detailed design, and will be responsible for implementation of the grants scheme.
20.         Budget Systems. An organic budget law was passed by the March 1994
NPC, codifying the 1991 budget regulation system. The law specifies a number of
principles and practices that may lead to a better allocation of public resources, and better
expenditure control. The law sets out the role and responsibilities of the various actors in
the budgetary process, codifies the new tax assignment and sharing system, and the
separation of central and local budgets, which de facto was already in place. The law only
allows borrowing for construction expenditures.  Since 1993, the central budget is
compiled according to the "dual budget" method, which divides the budget into a 'regular'
and "construction" budget. The PBC Law excludes overdrafts from PBC, a practice
already in place since the beginning of 1994. Local governments are, as before, not
allowed to borrow.
21.         Both the "dual budget" and the new intergovernmental fiscal relations require
fundamental changes in the budget accounting system. The "dual budget" reporting can
only be fully implemented if the accounting system corresponds with the "dual budget'
structure. The new intergovernmental fiscal relations put additional demands on the
information to be contained in the budget. The "standardized expenditure needs" basis of
the grants scheme requires adequate information on the costs of government programs,
which is at present hard to obtain from the budget.
22.         The preclusion from access to PBC financing increases the need for sound
and efficient treasury management, in order to minimize short-term debt obligations.
Improved treasury management would also be necessary to achieve the goals of expenditure
control as stated in the Budget Law. Finally, the new intergovernmental fiscal relations

have led the State Council to the decision that central and local government treasuries in

23.         The Government has asked the Bank Group and IMF for assistance in
implementing the current fiscal reforms and preparing future reforms. The project would
support the fiscal reforms by: (a) developing and implementing a new tax administration;
(b) strengthening capacity for tax policy analysis; (c) developing and implementing a
central-provincial grants scheme; and (d) improving budgetary processes and practices.
The project would contribute to improved management of public resources.
Tax Administration
24.         The tax administration component would support SAT with the development
and implementation of an NTS that is capable of implementing current and future tax
reforms.  The project would support the development and implementation of new
administrative procedures, organizational arrangements, and information systems. SAT's
implementation plan, developed with IMF assistance, calls for a phased implementation of
the reforms. During Phase I, the new tax administration will be tested on a pilot basis in
four cities (Beijing Haidan District, Wuxi, Xiaoshan, Shenyang). After a systems
assessment, the reforms will be rolled out to 14 other cities (Phase II). Subsequently, the
reforms would be implemented nationally, with over 200 cities planned to be in the NTS
network by the year 2000. The project will support Phases I and II. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that no roll-out will take place before satisfactory systems
assessment, and implementation of agreed improvements.
25.         SAT has established a Steering Committee, and has drafted new procedures
and organizational arrangements for the tax administration, which were reviewed by the
appraisal mission, and are expected to be finalized by August 1995. On the basis of this,
an information systems design and architecture would be developed, supported by a PHRD
grant, and the project. Selection of a consulting firm that would assist SAT in systems
design is expected to be finalized by April 1995.
26.         The information systems would be developed and implemented in one
development site, Haidian District in Beijing. China's priorities for computerization are
the VAT, the EIT and the PIT. The PIT is a local tax, but SAT plans to use the
information system of the NTS to process data for local taxes with high dataprocessing
requirements (PIT and EIT for locally owned enterprises). A PHRD grant will finance
systems design and specification covering the requirements of a nationwide information
system, database structures, dictionaries and overall hardware architecture. SAT plans to
first implement functions more closely related to collection (registration, filing, accounting,
stopfiler detection, etc.), whereas at a later stage information systems for audit, audit
selection, and internal management would be implemented.



- 8 -
27.         A preliminary architecture of the system includes data processing capacity
at three levels:
(a)   District.  The district level would become the main operational level.
Databases and processing capacity for, among others, registration, filing,
collection, stopfiler control, accounting, refunds, and appeals would be
maintained at this level.
(b)   City.  The city-level databases would maintain summarized taxpayers'
records for audit, audit selection, and statistical reporting, and information
for internal management purposes.
(c)   National. The national-level database would contain summarized historical
time series and sample individual data for tax policy analysis, and
summarized data on the tax administration organization for management and
strategy development purposes.
28.         In small cities, SAT intends to experiment with data processing capacity
centralized at the city level. In this architecture, the districts would retain the taxpayer's
files and would access the city-based database with terminals.
29.         SAT has decided to opt for an "open systems" concept, portable among
hardware platforms, and expandable according to needs. The information system should
be able to accommodate likely changes in the tax administration, including changes in tax
policy, changes in organizational setup, number of taxpayers, and changes in tax
administration policies, procedures and controls. SAT intends to use CASE, Relational
Database Management Systems, UNIX, and a Standard Systems Development
Methodology.
30.         The project would support: (a) CS for tax administration procedures and
information systems development; (b) training in administrative and managerial functions
and in systems development; and (c) equipment for the information system.
31.         Consultancies. The CS will focus on tax administrative functions and on
the development and implementation of the computer systems design. The systems design
will predominantly be implemented by SAT personnel, with assistance from programmers
financed under the project, and under guidance from the technical advisor and the
electronic data processing (EDP) advisor.  Assistance will also be provided in the
procurement and installation of equipment. China's authorities have decided against
resident advisors and intend to obtain advice through regular short-term consultations. The
main experts expected to be financed under the project are:
(a)   The Technical Advisors who would advise SAT on all aspects of the
development of the new tax administration system. SAT would hire one
foreign and two local experts. The advisors would assist SAT in project
management, notably in supervision of the systems design consultants, the



development of an installation plan for Phase I equipment and software, and
a roll-out plan for Phase II;
(b)   Systems Design Experts who would assist SAT in detailed design of the
data processing system;
(c)   Programmers who would assist SAT in construction of the data processing
system;
(d)   A Procurement Advisor who would assist SAT in the acquisition of hard-
and software for the new tax administration;
(e)   A Training Expert who would assist SAT in the development of a national
training plan, and on the development of key courses for the new tax
administration.
32.         Short-term CS will be financed for several management issues faced by
SAT, including personnel policy, cooperation with banks and Customs, and investment and
efficiency analysis for the tax administration.
33.         Training. Training will concentrate on those functions that are emphasized
by the new administrative procedures: audit and inspection; management and taxpayer's
information. SAT wants to build up local training capacity in those new functions, but
deems it necessary that local trainers for those functions be trained abroad. Information
technology (iT) training will strengthen SAT's in-house capacity for systems development,
implementation and maintenance. The project will also finance SAT's large training
program for new users of computers. A limited number of study tours would provide
comparative experience on some policy issues for the tax administration, including:
cooperation with banks and Customs; tax management systems, and city- and national-level
information systems; and tax enforcement measures. Several SAT staff will be seconded
to foreign tax administrations to obtain in-depth exposure to state-of-the-art-practices,
notably in audit, audit selection, and management.
34.         Equipment. Equipment and software acquisition will concentrate on the
district level, the main operational processing level.  City-level and national-level
computers would also be financed, as well as a district-level computer for one of SAT's
training schools.
Tax Policy Analysis
35.         China's authorities aim to improve China's tax policy analysis capacity in
order to perfect current tax reforms and to prepare future tax reforms. The tax policy
component will support this objective by: (a) improvements in the capacity for quantitative
tax policy analysis; (b) facilitating the gradual transfer of responsibility for tax policy
analysis from SAT to MOF; (c) the creation of tax policy analysis capacity at the
provincial level; and (d) the preparation of future tax reforms.



- 10 -
36.         The project expands the capacity for quantitative tax policy analysis by
improving the MOF enterprise survey and the State Statistical Bureau's (SSB) household
survey, making them more suited for tax policy analysis. The project would support
training in tax policy analysis for central government officials to enhance their capacity to
analyze the revenue impact of policy changes, and to conduct revenue forecasts. The more
advanced courses would be held overseas. The project would support the development of
an information system for the MOF-Tax Policy Department and the SAT Tax Policy and
Legislation Department for the processing of the survey data, and other policy-related data.
MOF staff would obtain IT training under the project.
37.         The project would support the gradual transfer of the tax policy function
from SAT to MOF. Currently, tax policy analysis is principally based within SAT, and
MOF comments on and clears SAT proposals on tax policy. The State Council has
recently assigned the tax policy formulation function to MOF, while SAT will concentrate
more on the administration of taxes. This division of labor is in line with intemational
experience. The project furthers this objective by supporting a number of joint studies in
tax policy, which would contribute to the transfer of knowledge from SAT to MOF, and
by financing training for MOF and SAT officials.
38.         Provinces have until now hardly any tax policy analysis capacity, as all
authority on tax rates and bases is vested in central govemment. With the emergence of
new intergovemmental fiscal arrangements, the authorities anticipate the need for increased
participation of subnational-level govemments in tax policy, and therefore for tax policy
analysis capacity at provincial level. The project would support this by financing training
in tax policy analysis for provincial-level assistance, and by providing personal computers
to each provincial-level fiscal authority for analysis, and for data collection for the national
survey. The project would finance studies on local taxes and tax assignment. Finance
Bureau staff would obtain IT training under the project.
39.         The joint MOF/SAT studies would refine the current reforms and prepare
for future tax reforms. Current reforms have moved China's tax system considerably in
the direction of a system suited for a market economy, but in several respects, the current
structure still requires adjustments. Moreover, early figures on 1994 tax collection suggest
that the current reforms will not increase the tax share in GNP, and future reforms would
seek a broadening of the tax base. The project would finance studies in the areas of: (a)
the VAT; (b) the EIT; (c) the PIT; (d) local taxes; (e) social security taxes; and (f)
environmental and resource taxes. The studies are part of the work plans of MOF and
SAT for the Ninth Five-Year Plan. The studies will be performed predominantly by
Chinese officials and researchers, but the project supports CS to provide the
methodological framework, assist in drafting outlines for the studies and control the quality
of the studies after draft final reports have been prepared.
Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations
40.         China's authorities aim to develop and implement an efficient and equitable
central-provincial grants scheme that would, according to objective criteria, redistribute



- 11 -
part of the increase in central government revenue to the provinces.   The
intergovernmental fiscal component supports this goal. The grants scheme is an essential
complement to the new revenue assignments. The authorities plan to implement the grants
scheme on a pilot basis in 1997. A date for nationwide implementation has not been
decided upon. Currently, the State Council Working Group is working on a conceptual
design for a grants scheme, an effort supported under a PHRD grant. Following the State
Council's approval of the conceptual design, the MOF Budget Department will assume the
responsibility for detailed implementation of the conceptual design. Implementation
requires a substantial effort in data gathering and analysis, and the training of people at
central- and provincial-level govemments.
41.         After the State Council Working Group produces the conceptual design, the
project will support detailed studies for the implementation of the grants scheme. This will
include the detailed norms and criteria on revenues and expenditures to be used in the
grants scheme, and the data and data reporting necessary to operationalize the grants
scheme. The project would support the pilot implementation of the grants scheme in
several provinces. The pilot would serve the development of administrative processes and
computer system to support the grants scheme. The project would support a number of
workshops to disseminate the results of the studies, to discuss the design of the pilot, and
to evaluate the plans for nationwide implementation. The project has earmarked resources
for nationwide implementation, once this has been decided upon by the State Council. The
project would finance extension of the computer system to all localities and a number of
seminars for the dissemination of the national grants scheme design.
42.         The project would support training at central and local level to enhance the
understanding of the grants scheme and to build implementation capacity. The project will
support a number of secondments of central officials to grants implementing agents in
various countries to provide MOF personnel with in-depth exposure to the day-to-day
administration of a grants scheme.
Budget System
43.         The Govemment aims to operationalize the 1994 Budget Law. The budget
systems component supports this goal by strengthening MOF's institutional capacity for
implementing reforms in the budget system. The component would enhance MOF's
understanding of best-practice budget procedures, practices and systems, and support the
formulation of a budget systems reform strategy appropriate for China.
44.        In a number of diagnostic studies, the budget systems component would
identify strengths and weaknesses in: (a) the budget accounting system; (b) treasury
management; (c) budget preparation and analysis; and (d) audit and inspection. The
studies would be performed primarily by Chinese officials assisted by foreign and local
consultants. In-country CS will be primarily provided in short-term consultations, to avoid
overburdening the key people within MOF.



- 12 -
45.          Study tours, training and international workshops would provide MOF with
exposure to best-practice budget systems. The international comparison and the diagnostic
studies would provide input for a budget systems reform strategy to be drafted by MOF.
The strategy would establish a long-run view for the development of an efficient budget
system that can support China's budgetary processes and practices. The strategy would
identify priority areas for implementation. Domestic workshops would disseminate and
discuss the findings of the studies.
46.          The project would also finance an expansion and improvement of the
existing treasury network of PBC. This high-priority investment would be done after an
assessment of the existing data processing system and implementation of agreed-on
improvements in software. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that no
procurement of equipment for the treasury network would be initiated before a systems
assessment has been implemented, and agreed improvements have been implemented.
3. PROJEcr COSTS AND FINANCaNG
47.          Total project base costs are estimated at about $88.2 million. Including
contingencies, total costs are estimated at $105.5 milion.5/ The base costs of the
various components are: (a) tax administration $76.3 million; (b) tax policy $4.8 million;
(c) intergovernmental fiscal relations $2.9 million; and (d) budget systems $4.3 million
(Table 2). Of the total base costs, 14.8 percent supports institutional development,
0.9 percent project implementation, 2.5 percent policy support, 45.4 percent automation,
and the remaining 36.3 percent consists of (five-year) incremental operating costs. In
terms of cost categories, 42.9 percent is devoted to equipment, 36.3 percent to incremental
operating costs, 6.2 percent to consultants' services, and 14.2 percent to training, seminars
and study tours. Detailed cost estimates can be found in Attachment 1.
48.          The Bank Group will finance 92 percent of foreign exchange costs, the
balance consisting of counterpart funding of computer equipment. The Bank Group will
finance 5.3 percent of local costs consisting of expenditures for CS. The total Bank Group
finance share is 47.4 percent. Two thirds of counterpart funding consists of incremental
operating costs for the investment in equipment.6/ Table 3 provides an overview of
financing arrangements; Attachment 1 provides a detailed financing plan.
4. OTHER DONOR ASSISTANCE
49.         In addition to the assistance provided by the project, IMR   and UNDP have
an ongoing TA program with SAT (about $400,000), under which advice on tax policy and
administration reforms is provided in specific areas, such as transfer pricing and VAT
S/  The current high domestic inflation in China inflates the domestic price contingencies in dollar terms,
as a constant nominal exchange rate is assumed in the calculations.
6/ The costs were estimated at 5 percent of the investment per year for PC-based systems, and 8 percent
for mini/medium-size computers. Five years of incremental operating costs were taken into account.

administration.  The content of the proposed project has been coordinated with this
program such that overlap is avoided. The tax administration reforms as pursued by SAT
rely heavily on IMF TA: IMF assisted SAT in developing a strategy and a draft
implementation plan. The Bank Group and IMF have closely cooperated in preparation,
will cooperate in the supervision of the tax administration component, and will closely
coordinate efforts in the other components (Section B5). IMF has provided TA to MOF
on grants design, the treasury function, and on budget nomenclature. The Asian
Development Bank (ADB) is financing a study on subprovincial finance in PY95.

SECTION B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
1. PROJECr IMPLEMENTATION
50.           For overall project coordination, a project coordination team has been set
up, consisting of representatives from SAT and MOF. The MOF World Bank Department
will coordinate the project implementation team and will advise on Bank Group policies
and procedures.   The World Bank Department and the International Cooperation

Departments of MOF and SAT will advise the implementation teams on the implementation
of study tours and foreign training. Under the project implementation team, three separate
implementation teams have been established for: (a) tax administration; (b) tax policy; and
(c) intergovernmental fiscal relations and budget systems (Figure 1).

51.           SAT is responsible for implementation of the tax administration component.
SAT has installed a Steering Committee to lead the reform efforts, headed by the Chief
Economist. The Steering Committee will clear all major steps in the reform effort, among
which are: specification of administrative procedures, systems design and architecture,
systems assessment; roll-out plan; training plan; and project completion reports. The SAT
has appointed a Tax Administration Reform Office (TARO) responsible for the day-to-day



- 16 -
implementation of the tax administration reforms. Under TARO, various working groups
will be responsible for the implementation of parts of the project (Figure 2). TARO will
be advised by the technical advisors and by a procurement advisor.  A training
development expert would assist in the drafting of training plans, and training financed
under the project.

52.          The major milestones of the component, including timing, deliverables and
responsibilities have been agreed upon. The roll-out of the computer systems is now
expected to be completed by the end of 1996 (Attachment 5). Terms of Reference for key
activities have been agreed upon.
53.          The Tax Policy Department in MOF and the Tax Policy and Legislation
Department in SAT have set up a joint tax policy unit to administer the tax policy
component. The Unit is led by the Director of the MOF Tax Policy Department and the
Deputy Director of the SAT Tax Policy and Legislation Department. Local consultants
would assist the tax policy unit in the organization and programming of training, studies,
study tours, and seminars. TORs for each project activity have been submitted to the Bank
and were discussed during appraisal.
54.         The MOF Budget Department is responsible for the intergovernmental fiscal
component and the budget systems component. The Department has established a project
team to implement the component. The Department will cooperate with the PBC Treasury
Department and the State Audit Administration on the relevant subcomponents of the
budget systems component, and with SAT, SRC and SSB on relevant parts of the
intergovernmental fiscal component. Local consultants would assist in organization and
programming of studies, training, study tours, and seminars. Outline TORs for all project
activities were discussed during negotiations.

55.         The Bank Group has obtained assurances that the Borrower will:
(a) maintain the project coordination team and the component implementation teams with
the resources necessary for smooth implementation of the project; and (b) adequately
maintain the equipment procured under the project. For this purpose, the Borrower would
sign maintenance contracts with qualified firms.
56.         For a detailed overview of the activities, the responsible agencies and
departments, and planned timing of the activities, see Attachment 4. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that the project components will be implemented in accordance
with action plans acceptable to the Bank Group.
2. PRocuREmENT
57.         Consultant Services. Consultant services required for the project would be
procured in accordance with the World Bank guidelines "Use of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as an Executing Agency" (August 1981).
Contracts with firms of $100,000 and with individuals of $50,000 or more would be
subject to Bank Group prior review.
58.         Goods. Goods (equipment and materials) contracts above $200,000 will be
subject to the Bank Group's international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures as stated
in the 'Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (January 1995).
Contracts estimated to be $200,000 or less and $800,000 or less in the aggregate will be
subject to national competitive bidding (NCB) with procedures acceptable to the Bank
Group, and contracts estimated to be $100,000 or less and $600,000 or less in the
aggregate would be subject to national shopping rules. For the procurement of equipment
and materials, Model Bidding Documents and standard contract documentation would be
used. A domestic preference for goods procured under ICB-15 percent of the CIF price,
or the actual tariff, whichever is less-will be allowed. All goods contracts over $200,000
would be subject to prior review.
59.         The equipment will be procured in phases. First, a development computer
and development software will be procured with the proceeds from a CRISSP subproject.
This would enable SAT to start developing the district system on the basis of the systems
design. Subsequently, an operational database management system would be procured by
ICB. This would allow SAT to start construction of the computer system before
acquisition of operational hardware. Then, equipment for the four cities would be
procured, with the 14 cities' expansion included as an option, leaving flexibility to adjust
hardware architecture after the first phase. SAT will be assisted by a procurement advisor
in preparing the procurement documents.

Note: Figures in parentheses are the amounts financed by the Bank/IDA. Figures may not add due to

3. DLSBURsEMENT
60.           An approximate disbursement profile is given in Table 5.  Disbursements
would be made for: (a) goods at 100 percent of foreign expenditures, 100 percent of local
expenditures (ex-factory) and 75 percent for other items procured locally; and
(b) consultants' services, training seminars, workshops and study tours at 100 percent of
expenditures. Disbursement against contracts for goods not exceeding $200,000 equivalent
and consultants' services performed by firms not exceeding $100,000 equivalent and for
consultant's services performed by individuals not exceeding $50,000 equivalent, training,
seminars, and study tours would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure
(SOEs). Retroactive financing of up to SDR 3.1 million, or about $4.5 million equivalent,
would be alowed for more urgent expenditures-among which Phase I equipment-paid
after March 1, 1995. Projected disbursements depend to a considerable extent on the roll-
out of the tax administration computer system. This roll-out, planned to be completed by



- 19 -
1996, may be delayed due to unexpected difficulties in design, construction, and piloting
of that system. The projected disbursement is therefore somewhat slower than implied by
the timetable in Attachments 4 and 5. The closing date of the loan and the credit would
be December 31, 1999.

61.         MOF will establish a special account in a bank acceptable to the Bank
Group, under conditions satisfactory to the Bank Group. The authorized allocation for the
Special Account is $5 million, which is somewhat higher than the usual four months of
average expenditures, because disbursements are concentrated in the first two years of the
project. Initial deposits amounting to $3 million equivalent will be made.
4. ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT ARRANGEMENT
62.         The project accounts and the special account would be maintained by the
MOF World Bank Department.  The project accounts, special account and the
documentation for SOEs would be subject to an annual audit by an independent auditor
satisfactory to the Bank Group. The audit reports, and separate opinions on SOEs and the
Special Accounts would be furnished to the Bank Group within six months of the end of
the Government's fiscal year.
5. MoNrroRiNG AND PROGRESS REPORTING
63.         For each project component, semiannual activity plans would be prepared
by the implementation team, and furnished to the Bank Group for discussion and
concurrence. Each work plan would include: planning on the subcomponents under
implementation, and the subcomponents under preparation; detailed description and terms
of reference for the components; and budget and expected disbursements for the
subcomponents.
64.         For the tax administration component, progress reports would be prepared
by the implementation team according to the Schedule in Attachment 5 and furnished to
the Bank Group. For the project as a whole, semiannual progress reports would be
prepared. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations. The complexity of the
tax administration component requires a higher frequency of progress reporting. The



- 20 -
reports would summarize progress on the subcomponents, including activities undertaken,
disbursements, output, and implementation issues. Key indicators for monitoring progress
in the activities, as well as the various reports to be produced are summarized in
Attachments 4 and 5.
65.         Output and Impact Indicators. For tax administration, output indicators
would be: (a) the implementation of the new procedures, organizational arrangements and
the new information system in the 18 project sites; and (b) the number of people trained.
The impact of the tax administration reforms would be measured by improvements in
efficiency indicators, among which: (i) number of taxpayer registrations and returns
processed per employee; (ii) number of taxpayers' questions answered, and average
response time; (iii) speed of assembling daily, monthly and annual reports; and (iv)
average tax collection per employee.
66.         For the Tax Policy Component, the main output indicators would be: (a) the
implementation of the revised enterprise survey; (b) the completion of the studies; and
(c) the number of people trained. The final impact indicator would be a broadening of
the tax base and an improvement of the tax structure. This impact, however, largely
depends on political decisions, which fall outside the control of the implementing agencies.
67.         For the Intergovernmental Fiscal Component, output indicators are:
(a) completion of the studies for grants design; (b) number of people trained; and
(c) discussion seminars completed. The main impact indicator would be the national
introduction of an efficient and equalizing grants scheme. This, however, again depends
primarily on a political decision to implement the grants scheme developed under the
project.
68.         For the Budget Systems Component, the main output indicators are: (a) the
completion of the diagnostic studies; (b) expansion of an improved treasury network in one
or two provinces; and (c) the number of people trained. Impact indicators would be the
implementation of the recommendations made in the diagnostic studies.
6. SUPERVISION
69.         Supervision of the project would require an estimated 16 staff-weeks per
year, excluding IMF staff. In the first year, the supervision of the tax administration
component will require more than proportional attention, due to the various critical
decisions on hiring and procurement to be made. Supervision missions for the whole
project will be fielded three times a year for the first two years, and semiannually
afterwards (see Attachment 7 for further detail).
70.         The Bank Group and IMF will continue close cooperation in the supervision
of the project. The IMF plans to assist the Bank Group in supervising the substantive
aspects of tax administration and systems design and implementation. The Bank Group
would retain overall supervision responsibility, including procurement and disbursements.



- 21 -
7. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOus BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT
71.         Bank Group and IMF involvement in tax administration projects suggests
three key factors for success: (a) high political commitment; (b) a clear reform strategy;
(c) a strong implementation team; and (d) use of pilot project to test new systems and
procedures before nationwide implementation. This experience also shows that procedural
and organizational change should precede computerization, and that self-assessment
combined with effective audit techniques and proper administration-intemal resource
allocation provides for the most efficient tax administration.
72.         Bank Group experience in budget systems reforms shows that such reforms
require a long lead time, and that a clear strategy for a revised budget system should
precede implementation of reforms.
73.         The Bank Group has no previous project experience in the field of fiscal
management in China, but there have been seven technical assistance projects: two
Technical Cooperation Projects (Cr. 1412-CHA, Cr. 1664-CHA), a Planning Support and
Special Studies Project (Cr. 1835-CHA), a Reform, Institutional Support and Preinvestment
Project (Cr. 2447-CHA), a Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 2423-CHA),
an Environmental Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 2522-CHA) and an Economic Law
Reform Project (Cr. 2654-CHA). Among the lessons leamed are the need for: (a)
political commitment to the goals of the operation; (b) preidentification of sufficient
subproject activities; (c) avoidance of excessive financing of hardware and overseas
training; and (d) a firm implementation plan, including onlending arrangements between
MOF and the beneficiary agencies.
74.         The political commitment to fiscal reforms is high, as witnessed by The
Decisions of November 1993.  The hardware acquisition is predominantly in tax
administration, and is firmly supported by the overall reform strategy in that area, which
aims to revise procedures and organization before new computer systems are developed.
SAT's Steering Committee and implementation team, supplemented by advisors, provide
a guarantee for implementation of the tax administration component. The budget systems
component aims to develop a long-term strategy for budget system and to build the
capacity to implement such reforms. The appraisal mission has agreed on design and
implementation of overseas training and study tours that ensures their quality and impact.
Most project activities had been identified in preparation, and most TORs were discussed
at appraisal.  The structure of the implementation teams guarantees the necessary
coordination among agencies. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Borrower
will allocate the loan/credit proceeds to the various implementing agencies free of charge.
8. RATIONALE FOR BANK/IDA INVOLVEMENT
75.         The implementation of fiscal and tax reforms is a high priority for China's
government, and the Minister of Finance has directly asked the Bank Group and IMF to
support the proposed project. Fiscal reforms are central to the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy, in which implementation of macroeconomic reforms is one of the primary



- 22 -
objectives. Improved fiscal management would serve as a catalyst for reforms in other
sectors such as banking and SEs, because with increased and better-managed resources
these sectors can be relieved of government functions. A more equitable distribution of
fiscal resources would contribute to poverty reduction. In addition, increased fiscal
resources in poor provinces would relieve some of the shortage of counterpart funds for
Bank Group projects in those provinces.
76.         The Government's reform program corresponds closely with the Bank
Group's recommendations in economic and sector work, and policy dialogue. The tax
administration and intergovernmental fiscal components directly address implementation
of the reforms initiated in 1994. The budget systems and the tax policy component support
preparation of reforms in areas where further improvements could still be made. The tax
policy component aims at rationalization and broadening of the tax base, and the budget
systems component prepares reforms that would increase the efficiency of government
expenditures.
9. PRoJEcT BENEFr
77.         The project would:  (a) contribute to increased efficiency in revenue
generation and government expenditure; (b) enhance the productivity of the tax
administration and reduce burdens on the taxpayer; (c) increase the efficiency of the tax
structure; (d) improve the equitable distribution of government resources among provinces;
and (e) improve allocation of budget resources.  Total project costs are less than
0.2 percent of annual tax collection, and about 2 percent of collection in the districts
directly financed under the project. Thus, only a marginal improvement in collection
efficiency would make the project financially viable.
10. AGREEMENTS OBTAINED AT NEGOTIATIONS
78.         During negotiations, the Bank Group obtained agreements with the Borrower
on: (a) a proper phasing and a realistic planning in the tax administration reforms (para.
24); (b) systems assessment and improvements before procurement of equipment for the
PBC treasury (para. 46); (c) the Borrower will allocate the credit/loan proceeds to the
various implementing agencies free of charge (para. 74); (d) the modalities of project
management, implementation and monitoring (paras. 55, 56, and 64); and (e) adequate
maintenance of equipment procured under the project (para. 55).
11. RISKS
79.         The Government is very anxious to reform the tax administration quickly,
and SAT may be pressured to rush the implementation of the project. This risk will be
addressed by agreements at negotiations with SAT on a realistic timetable, and by
agreements on the phased project design, which requires satisfactory implementation of one
phase before activities for the next phase are implemented.



- 23 -
80.         Poor coordination among participating Chinese agencies may delay
implementation. The structure of the implementation teams would serve as a means to
resolve potential conflict among these agencies, and minimize the risk.
81.         A third risk lies in overburdening key officials in MOF and SAT. This has
been reduced by hiring local consultants under the project to supplement the staff of the
participating agencies, and by phasing the activities over time.
82.         A final risk lies with the possibility that SAT implements the computer
system without following up on the associated reforms in tax administration procedures.
Policy dialogue during implementation of the project will emphasize the importance of the
latter, and thus minimize this risk.

ATTACIHMENT 6
TRAINIG PLAN
1.          The project includes a comprehensive training component to strengthen the
institutional capacity of SAT, NTS in the 18 project locations, MOF, and the provincial-
level Finance and Tax Bureaus. The training program would provide specialized training
and training for trainers abroad, and would provide training for operational staff in-
country. In addition, a number of secondments would be financed under the project to
provide in-depth exposure to best practices in tax administration, budget management and
grants administration for key individuals of SAT and MOF. No degree training is planned
under the project.
2.          Tax Administration. The training under this component emphasizes new
functions in the tax administration, such as taxpayers' services, information management,
and auditing. In these fields, future trainers would be educated abroad. The trainers would
not only be used for the 18 project sites, but also are expected to play a central role in the
expansion of the NTS nationwide. In addition, training in computer systems design and
implementation would enhance SAT's in-house capacity to further develop and implement
the information system, which would enhance sustainability of the new NTS.
3.          Domestic training would include the training of all personnel of the project
sites. All computer operators would be trained in computer applications; tax administration
personnel would be trained in the skills required by the new functional organization of the
NTS bureaus (Registration, taxpayers' services, filing, collection and accounting, audit,
appeals).
4.          SAT would be responsible for the design of the training, assisted by the
Bank Group and IMF; the International Cooperation Department would be responsible for
organization of the training abroad, and the Training Department would be responsible for
domestic training. Domestic training would be delivered at the various training schools
and colleges of SAT, by full-time trainers, and by operational tax administrators. Foreign
training would be contracted out to specialized organizations, such as OECD's Training
Network for Tax Officials; IMF; Tax Consultants, and development institutes at
universities. Training in systems design would be contracted out to the consulting firm that
supports SAT in systems design; and computer application courses would be provided by
the hardware vendor. A timetable for the training activities, including estimates of the
number of officials to be trained, is included in Attachment 4. Outline curricula for the
training courses were developed by SAT before negotiations, and are available in the
project files.

5.          Tax Policy. The training under this component aims to strengthen tax policy
analysis capacity of MOF, SAT and Finance Bureau officials. Basic tax policy analysis
courses, predominantly aimed at provincial-level officials, would be provided domestically.
More specialized courses in tax policy analysis, predominantly aimed at central-level
officials, would be held abroad.
6.          The Tax Policy Unit of SAT and MOF would be responsible for the design
of the training courses, assisted by the Bank Group. At negotiations, it was agreed that
the Bank Group would provide the Tax Policy Unit with a list of institutions that would
be capable of providing the required training. The international cooperation departments
of MOF and SAT, and the World Bank Department of MOF would be responsible for
implementation of the training abroad. The domestic training would be held at training
colleges of MOF and SAT. Most foreign training would be contracted out to specialized
institutions such as various development institutes and tax consultant firms. Outline
curricula for the courses were developed by TPU before negotiations, and are available in
the project files.  Approximate timetables for the training courses are included in
Attachment 4.
7.          Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations. The training for this component aims
to strengthen the capacity for grants systems development and implementation. A number
of senior-level training courses abroad in intergovernmental fiscal relations would enhance
the absorptive capacity of Chinese officials for the studies financed under the project, and
the capacity to further develop the designs to Chinese circumstances. A series of domestic
seminars would, besides disseminating the grants design developed, increase understanding
of intergovernmental fiscal issues at subnational level. Five staff would be seconded to
foreign institutions administering a grants scheme, in order to obtain in-depth exposure to
best practice operation of a grants scheme.
8.          The MOF budget department will be responsible for the design of the
training courses, assisted by MOF World Bank Department, and the Bank Group. At
negotiations, it was agreed that the Bank Group would provide MOF with a list of suitable
institutions for training. The international cooperation and the World Bank Department
would be responsible for the implementation of the foreign training. Domestic training
would be held at various training facilities of MOF and provincial finance bureaus.
Foreign training would be supplied by specialized institutions with extensive experience
in teaching in public policy and intergovernmental fiscal issues. Universities and institutes
in countries with operating grants schemes, such as Australia, Canada, and Germany would
likely be most suited. Outline curricula for the training courses have been submitted by
the MOF Budget Department, and are available in the project files. An approximate
timetable for the training activities, including the expected number of beneficiaries, is
included in Attachment 4.
9.          Budget Systems. The training under this component aims to build the
institutional capacity necessary to implement reforms in budgetary management. Key
individuals at central government level would be trained abroad in a broad area of
budgetary management. Subnational-level officials would be trained domestically in the



- 48 -                      Attachment 6
same area. Domestic seminars would, in addition to disseminating the results of the
studies prepared under the component, expose Finance Bureau officials to key issues in
budgetary management.
10.        The MOF Budget Department would be responsible for the design of the
training courses, assisted by the MOF World Bank Department and the Bank Group. At
negotiations, it was agreed that the Bank Group would provide MOF with a list of suitable
institutions for training. The MOF International cooperation department and the World
Bank department would be responsible for the implementation of overseas training. The
overseas training would be contracted out to institutions and consultant firms with a wide
experience in training for budgetary management. Outline curricula for the training
courses were provided by MOF before negotiations, and are available in the project files.
Attachment 4 provides a preliminary timing for the training activities.
