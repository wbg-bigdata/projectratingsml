MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA
FOR A HEALTH SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Republic of Bulgaria for the equivalent of US$26.0 million equivalent
to help finance a Health Sector Restructuring Project. The loan will be at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate, for a currency pool loan with a maturity of 20 years,
including a grace period of five years. In addition, the Government will receive a loan in an
amount of US$11.0 million from the Council of Europe Social Development Fund (CEF) and
a grant in an amount of US$2.3 million equivalent from EU PHARE.
2.          Country/Sector Background. Bulgaria began the transition to a market
economy with a well developed health infrastructure and relatively good health indicators.
However, as economic conditions deteriorated, health indicators stopped progressing and
even declined in some instances. Infant mortality is rising (from 14.4 per thousand live
births in 1989 to 15.9 in 1992). Maternal mortality, at 20 per 100,000 live births, is twice
the level of OECD countries. Due to the unavailability of modern contraceptives, Bulgaria
has one of the highest abortion rates in the world (1.4 abortions per live births in 1991).
Immunization rates, which were among the highest in Europe, are declining.
3.          Overall, epidemiological conditions are characteristic of an aging population.
Diseases of the circulatory system are major contributors to the increasing difference in
mortality rates between Bulgaria and western EuropeY  Stroke mortality is the highest in
Europe, whereas mortality rates due to cancer are near the European average. Lifestyle is a
major factor affecting mortality and morbidity patterns: tobacco consumption is on the rise in
the population below 35, and among women in particular; alcohol consumption is relatively
high; the percentage of animal fat in the diet is increasing.
4.          Bulgaria is undergoing a difficult transition characterized by severe economic
dislocations, change from a centrally planned health system to a decentralized one, and an
attempt to move away from a publicly financed and provided health system toward a publicly
financed and both privately and publicly provided system. In line with the decline in health
indicators over the last few years, there is increasing evidence that essential services have
either deteriorated in quality or become extremely costly to sustain. Primary health care
(PHC), which in Bulgaria is neither comprehensive, nor clearly differentiated from other
services, is characterized by shortages of essential medical supplies, low paid and
demotivated medical staff, and inability to offer even the minimum level of preventive and
I' In 1991, the age-standardized mortality rates per 100,000 population from disease of the
circulatory system totalled 160.4, as compared to an average of 62.3 for the European Union.



- 2 -
promotive care. In a country where cardiovascular mortality and accidents are among the
leading causes of mortality, emergency medical services are provided by a fragmented
network of pre-hospital and hospital institutions with no clear definition of responsibilities
and with completely outdated equipment. Finally, with the rapid decline in the number of
blood donors, the increasing difficulty in controlling the quality of blood products in a very
decentralized system, and obsolete equipment and technology, the situation of blood
transfusion and hematology is critical.
5.          The health care delivery system, generously endowed with physical facilities
and staff, is characterized by widespread inefficiency. With 3.1 physicians and 12.3 hospital
beds per 1,000 inhabitants, and a primary care center for every 2,400 inhabitants, Bulgaria
has medical staffing and service capacity which are at the high end of the range for both
Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries and countries with established market
economies. This system places a heavy fiscal burden on a country where per capita income
has fallen from US$2,680 in 1989 to only US$1,160 in 1993, and government revenues have
contracted by 50 percent in real terms since 1989.2' Government needs to bring about
necessary adjustments aimed at improving the efficiency of the sector and controlling costs.
6.          Government Strategy. Over the past two years, the Government has
introduced a number of reforms aimed at improving the quality of health care and promoting
new financing arrangements. First, legislation has been enacted to allow private practice for
physicians, dentists and pharmacists. Second, the health care delivery system has been
decentralized, with municipalities now assuming major responsibility in the management of
health facilities. Third, access to medical education has been regulated, and new programs
are being developed, particularly with regard to the training of general practitioners.
Finally, legislation is being prepared for the introduction a national health insurance scheme.
The thrust of the reform program is to establish the basis for a mixed public/private system
of health care delivery, funded in large part through a contributory health insurance scheme,
the main elements of which are still being debated.
7.          More recently, the Government has defined the main orientations of a
comprehensive reform strategy for the health sector. The main building blocks of this
policy framework, as reflected in a Policy Statement prepared by MOH, are:
(a) streamlining the network of health care facilities, through reorganization of health
services at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels; (b) restructuring and strengthening
essential public health services such as primary care, emergency care and blood transfusion
services; (c) developing financing mechanisms which provide incentives for cost containment
' Despite the loss of revenues, expenditure in the health sector has been maintained in real terms,
increasing as proportion of GDP (from 3.4% in 1989 to 5.4% in 1992) and as a proportion of total
Government expenditure (from 5.8% in 1989 to 11.9% in 1992). However, fiscal pressure made
spending cuts inevitable and health expenditures were trimmed to 5.1% of GDP in 1993 and 4.7% of
GDP in 1994.



- 3 -
and quality of care as a prelude to the introduction of national health insurance in the
medium term; (d) eliminating bottlenecks in the supply of critical inputs, especially drugs;
and (e) reforming the medical profession with regard to training, working conditions and
remuneration. Critical pieces of legislation have been enacted, notably decrees for the
creation of National Emergency Services, a law for Blood Donation and use of Blood and
Blood Components and, a decree transferring all responsibilities for blood collection and
processing to the MOH.
8.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. Bulgaria faces the challenge of adapting its
health care delivery system to the new requirements of a country in transition. While the
Government has clearly identified the most important policy changes, up to now it has not
been able to translate them into concrete programs and investments. As a result, very little
restructuring has taken place over the past three years. The proposed investments will assist
the MOH in structuring its approach through support of key reforms in primary health care,
emergency services and blood transfusion, which are the main pillars of modem medicine,
and will initiate longer-term reforms in health care organization and financing.
9.          The Bank has assumed a leading role in helping Bulgaria in the transition to a
market economy and in foreign assistance coordination. The Bank's strategy in the social
sectors is to support the development of policies and programs aimed at ensuring both a
fiscally viable social safety net and the reorientation of the country's human capital
production systems to the new requirements of democratic and market economies.
Continuing access to quality health care, especially by underprivileged groups, at an
acceptable cost to the individual and the community, is an essential element of the social
safety net, providing ample justification for Bank's involvement in this sector. Moreover,
the Bank can mobilize and apply significant expertise for the restructuring of the health
sector and its adjustment to the fiscal contraction.
10.         The proposed project is consistent with the draft Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) -- both of which are being presented to the Executive Directors simultaneously. By
financing the restructuring and upgrading of the health care delivery system, the proposed
project supports one of the priorities of the CAS, namely the need to establish financially
viable and effective social sector policies and institutions, including a social safety net.
11.         Project Objectives. The overall objective of the project is to prevent further
deterioration in the health status of the population, while at the same time improving the
efficiency of the health care delivery system. More specifically the project will: (i) facilitate
the restructuring of the health sector by strengthening the policy analysis and management
capacity in the sector; and (ii) protect the population at large--and vulnerable groups in
particular--by ensuring continued provision of essential health services during the transition
period and beyond.

12.         Project Description. These activities will be achieved through a set of
interventions articulated within the following components:
(i) Policy Analysis and Management. This component will assist the MOH in building
up a capacity for policy analysis and evaluation and will finance a limited number of key
studies such as a burden of disease analysis and cost-effectiveness studies. The component
will also finance computer software and hardware, as well as basic office equipment to
support the Economic Analysis Unit and the network of Regional Health Centers, as they
introduce new methodologies related to public health sector restructuring and flexible
budgeting, and they monitor and evaluate the implementation of health sector reforms. The
component will also finance long-term and short-term fellowships in the areas of health
planning, management, economics and finance, and health education and communications, as
well as public information activities.
(ii) Primary Health Care. This component will improve the quality and scope of
primary health care in selected municipalities, which are committed to the introduction of the
reform of health services delivery and financing, and to improve the efficiency of the health
sector. The component will finance minor rehabilitation for up to 270 local health centers
and 42 polyclinics. It will also finance consultant services to assist MOH and Municipal
Councils to plan PHC activities, design and implement the new package of PHC services and
training programs for medical doctors, nurses and other health and social workers and well
targeted municipal health promotion activities.
(iii) Emergency Medical Services. This component will support ongoing efforts by
MOH to restructure emergency medical services and improve the effectiveness and efficiency
of service delivery, by separating EMS functions from those of the PHC network and
creating a three-tiered national EMS network. The component will finance minor civil works
for base stations at the periphery and minor civil works and equipment for two types of
emergency rooms (21 regional hospital and 45 community hospital emergency rooms). In
addition, it will finance 29 properly equipped intervention vehicles for the medical teams,
and 96 ambulances for the basic life support teams in the pre-hospital services. The
component will also finance consultant services to assist in completing the conception,
coordinating the implementation, and managing the EMS and in training medical,
paramedical and administrative staff.
(iv) Blood Transfusion. This component will assist current efforts to improve the
supply and quality of blood and blood products by restructuring and rehabilitating the
network of blood transfusion centers, by introducing safer and more up to date technology
and by promoting actively the recruitment of new donors. The component will finance minor
civil works and equipment to renovate existing facilities of the National Center for Clinical
and Transfusion Hematology (NCCTH) and the five Regional Transfusion Hematology
Centers (RTHCs) in Sofia, Plovdiv, Pleven, Stara Zagora and Varna. It will finance



- 5 -
technical assistance to design programs, and training for health personnel engaged in donor
recruitment, public relations, blood collection and processing, and quality control.
13.         Financing. Total project costs are estimated at US$47.1 million, including
contingencies and taxes. The proposed IBRD loan of US$26.0 million equivalent will
finance 85 percent of foreign exchange costs. In addition, the Government will receive a
loan in an amount of US$11.0 million equivalent from the Council of Europe Social
Development Fund (CEF) and a grant in an amount of US$2.3 million equivalent from EU
PHARE. Government financing of US$7.8 million equivalent will finance the balance of
local costs. Estimated project costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Schedule
B describes procurement methods and disbursements.
14.         Project Implementation and Sustainability. This project will be implemented
through well established mechanisms and structures by MOH and concerned Municipalities.
The MOH anticipates a phased approach to the reform process, and wide consultation with
medical authorities and administrators of health care delivery institutions in concerned
Municipalities has already been initiated. The project builds upon and expands successful
activities financed under the European Union PHARE program. The project focuses on the
restructuring of existing institutions and as such is not expected to lead to increased recurrent
budgetary outlays. If anything, the consolidation of institutions and related redeployment of
staff will lead to budgetary savings.
15.         Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that an
annual review of the health sector budget, including assessment of the priority public
investment program for health, will be conducted jointly with the Bank, in order to ensure
resource reallocation in line with priorities, as stated in the Health Policy Statement. In
addition, carefully selected monitoring indicators will allow measurement of progress toward
the adoption of indicative norms for the utilization of physical and staff resources and will be
reviewed as part of the mid-term project review. With regard to the primary health care
component, contractual agreements will be signed between Municipalities and the MOH.
With regard to the emergency medical services component, protocols, specifying assets and
staff to be transferred in the context of the creation of the National Emergency Medical
Services will be signed between the MOH and the remaining Municipalities.  Finally, with
regard to the blood transfusion component, protocols, specifying assets and staff to be
transferred in the context of the creation of National Blood Transfusion Service will be
signed between the MOH and the concerned Municipalities .
16.         As a condition of effectiveness of the Bank Loan, all the conditions of
effectiveness of the CEF Loan, other than the effectiveness of the Bank Loan, namely
signing and ratification by Parliament, would be met.
17.         Environmental Aspects. No adverse impact on the environment is expected
from the project. Particular attention has been paid in project design to ensure adequate



- 6 -
disposal of sanitary, medical and laboratory waste. The Project has been classified as C:
"No appreciable environmental impact."
18.         Program Objective Category. The Project supports the Government's policy
of improving health and increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the health service
delivery system. With a focus on upgrading primary care and emergency services, the
Project is expected to contribute indirectly to poverty alleviation and the role of women in
development. The Project falls into one category: Poverty Reduction and Human Resource
Development (100 percent).
19.         Participatory Approach. The proposed project was prepared largely by the
Ministry of Health and related institutions. Four working groups were established in 1994 to
prepare the respective components. These working groups included MOH staff, as well as
representatives from the medical profession and from academia. Extensive consultations
took place throughout project preparation between members of the working groups and
representatives of the Municipalities concerned by the project. In particular, seminars were
organized to explain the project concept and elicit support from municipal authorities and
their medical staff. A Japan Grant, in an amount of US$ 500,000, supported these activities
and provided support to the working groups through local and foreign technical assistance
and training.
20.         Benefits. The project will have four major benefits. It will: (i) contribute to
economic growth and increased lifetime income for individuals through the impact of
improved health status on labor productivity, fewer work loss days, a longer working life,
increased ability of individuals to obtain better jobs, and (through the positive interaction of
health and education) increased enrollment and improved ability to learn; (ii) reduce poverty
and improve equity by targeting health interventions to the poor who stand to gain the most
in economic terms from improvements in health status; (iii) increase the efficiency of the
health system by focusing on health interventions (e.g. preventive and primary) that are
known to be the most cost effective, i.e., those that yield the greatest gains in disability
adjusted life years per unit cost (through a decrease in infant, maternal and other adult
mortality, lower levels of disability associated with various degrees of illness), and by
improving the institutional organization, service delivery, and input utilization of the health
sector; and, (iv) improve fiscal balance and promote macro-economic stability by containing
cost escalation in the health sector.
21.         Risks. The most important risk faced by the project lies in the lack of
experience and weak managerial capabilities of MOH staff engaged in a major reform and
restructuring program. This risk will be offset by building on and expanding ongoing
programs which are being implemented successfully by other donors and by financing a
supporting technical assistance and training program. Other risks are linked to the country's
exceptional conditions. For instance, political uncertainties still inhibit the full commitment
of some officials to the reform program. Moreover, unrealistic expectations are often



- 7 -
generated by a misperception of Western systems or optimistic views on the time and
resources required to develop and introduce a specific reform. These risks will be somewhat
mitigated by financing information activities aimed at building a national consensus on health
sector reform and initiatives to break the isolation of MOH staff and develop professional
contacts with other Western institutions.
22.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
