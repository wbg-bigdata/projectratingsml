BULGARIA
HEALTH SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Loan and Project Summarm
BORROWER:        Bulgaria
BENEFICIARY: Ministry of Health (MOH)
LOAN AMOINT: US$26.0 million
TERMS:           Twenty years, including a five-year grace period, at the IBRD standard
variable rate for a currency pool loan.
PROJECT
oBJECTIVES       The overall objective of the project is to prevent further deterioration in
the health status of the population, while at the same time improving the
efficiency of the health care delivery system. More specifically the
objectives of the project are to: (i) facilitate restructuring of the health
sector by strengthening the policy analysis and management capacity in
the sector; and (ii) protect the population at large--and vulnerable
groups in particular--by ensuring continuing provision of essential health
services during the transition period and beyond.
DESCRIIION:   The Project will be implemented over a five-year period by the MOH
and concerned Municipalities. Total project cost is estimated at
US$47.0 million (including contingencies). The Project will finance
specialist advisory assistance, overseas and local training, study visits,
materials, equipment, computer hardware and software, facilities
rehabilitation, and incremental recurrent costs. The Project comprises
four main components:
(i) Policy Analysis and Management. This component would assist the
MOH in building up a capacity for policy analysis and evaluation and
would finance a limited number of key studies such as a burden of
disease analysis and cost-effectiveness studies. The component would
also finance computer software and hardware, as well as basic office
equipment to support the Economic Analysis Unit and the network of
Regional Health Centers, as they introduce new methodologies related to
public health sector restructuring and flexible budgeting, and monitor
and evaluate the implementation of health sector reforms. The
component will also finance long-term and short-term fellowships in the
areas of health planning, management, economics and finance, and



- iv -
health education and communications, as well as public information
activities.
(ii) Primary Health Care. This component will improve the quality and
scope of primary health care in selected municipalities, which are
committed to the introduction of the reform of health services delivery
and financing, and to improve the efficiency of the health sector. The
component will finance minor rehabilitation, equipment and furniture for
up to 270 local health centers and 42 polyclinics. It will also finance
consultant services to assist MOH and Municipal Councils to plan PHC
activities, design and implement the new package of PHC services and
training programs for medical doctors, nurses and other health and social
workers and well targeted municipal health promotion activities.
(iii) Emergency Medical Services. This component will support ongoing
efforts by MOH to restructure emergency medical services and improve
the effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery, by separating EMS
functions from those of the PHC network and creating a three-tiered
national EMS network. The component will finance minor civil works
for base stations at the periphery and minor civil works and equipment
for two types of emergency rooms (21 regional hospital and 45
community hospital emergency rooms). In addition, it will finance 29
properly equipped intervention vehicles for the medical teams, and 96
ambulances for the basic life support teams in the pre-hospital services.
The component will also finance consultant services to assist in
completing the conception, in coordinating the implementation, and in
managing the EMS and in training medical, paramedical and
administrative staff.
(iv) Blood Transfusion. This component will assist current efforts to
improve the supply and quality of blood and blood products by
restructuring and rehabilitating the network of blood transfusion centers,
by introducing safer and more up to date technology and by promoting
actively the recruitment of new donors. The component will finance
minor civil works and equipment to renovate existing facilities of the
National Center for Clinical and Transfusion Hematology (NCCTH) and
the five Regional Transfusion Hematology Centers (RTHCs) in Sofia,
Plovdiv, Pleven, Stara Zagora, and Varna. It will also finance
technical assistance to design programs, and training for health personnel
engaged in donor recruitment, public relations, blood collection and
processing, and quality control.



- v 
BENEFITS:        The project will have four major benefits. It will: (i) contribute to
economic growth and increased lifetime income for individuals through
the impact of improved health status on labor productivity, fewer work
loss days, a longer working life, increased ability of individuals to obtain
better jobs, and (through the positive interaction of health and education)
increased enrollment and improved ability to learn; (ii) reduce poverty
and improve equity by targeting health interventions to the poor who
stand to gain the most in economic terms from improvements in health
status; (iii) increase the efficiency of the health system by focusing on
health interventions (e.g. preventive and primary) that are known to be
the most cost effective, i.e., those that yield the greatest gains in
disability adjusted life years per unit cost (through a decrease in infant,
maternal and other adult mortality, lower levels of disability associated
with various degrees of illness), and by improving the institutional
organization, service delivery, and input utilization of the health sector;
and, (iv) improve fiscal balance and promote macro-economic stability
by containing cost escalation in the health sector.
RISKS:           The most important risk faced by the project lies in the lack of
experience and weak managerial capabilities of MOH staff engaged in a
major reform and restructuring program. This risk will be offset by
building on and expanding ongoing programs which are being
implemented successfully by other donors and by financing a supporting
technical assistance and training program. Other risks are linked to the
country's exceptional conditions. For instance, political uncertainties
still inhibit the full commitment of some officials to the reform program.
Moreover, unrealistic expectations are often generated by a
misconception of Western systems or optimistic views on the time and
resources required to develop and introduce a specific reform. These
risks will be somewhat mitigated by financing information activities
aimed at building a national consensus on health sector reform and
initiatives to break the isolation of MOH staff and develop professional
contacts with other Western institutions.

BULGARIA
HEALTH SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
A. Introduction
1.1         Bulgaria began the transition to a market economy with a well developed
health infrastructure and good health indicators in many respects. However, as economic
conditions deteriorated, health indicators stopped progressing and even declined in some
instances. Indicators show a rising infant mortality, rising incidence of tuberculosis,
epidemics of communicable diseases, decreased availability of blood products, increasing
incidence of iodine deficiency, and imminent collapse of blood transfusion and hematology.
As transition to a market-oriented economic and restructuring of the health system are
medium-term processes, there is a real danger of further deterioration of current trends
before a new health system performs adequately.
1.2         In keeping with the transition to a more market-oriented economy, the country
is moving from a highly centralized, public sector health system toward a more diverse and
decentralized system in which the private sector is expected to play a crucial--yet still
indeterminate--role. However, the fast pace of decentralization of the health care delivery
system and the unregulated emergence of private health care providers pose a real threat to
the quality of health care. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the medical community are
wrestling with the most complex and often controversial issues such as the introduction of
health insurance, the allocation of resources in a decentralized setting and the means to
encourage greater efficiency and improved quality of health services.
1.3         The system places a heavy fiscal burden on a country where per capita income
has fallen from US$2,680 in 1989 to only US$1,160 in 1993. Govemment revenues have
contracted by 50 percent in real terms since 1989. Despite the loss of revenues, expenditure
in the health sector was maintained in real terms until 1993, when across the board budget
cuts were introduced. Nonetheless, the situation remains financially unsustainable, and the
system needs to adjust to the new fiscal reality. The urgency of reform has been heightened
by the political, economic and social forces which have come into play during the transition.
This first project in the health sector in Bulgaria will promote the necessary adjustments in
the health care system, while at the same time providing urgent investments aimed at
protecting key health services which are part of the safety net and essential for developing
the country's human capital.

B. Health Status of the Population''
1.4         Since the 1950s, the health of the population has substantially improved as
shown by the trends in most health indicators. This improvement, however, has lagged since
1985 and appears to be reversing itself in the last four or five years. Like many East
European countries, Bulgaria faces a major challenge in improving the health of its adult
population, particularly low income groups and minorities.
1.5         Bulgaria's population of about 9 million is aging rapidly, and is expected to
remain stable till the end of the century.Y' The crude birth rate (10.0 per thousand) has fallen
below the replacement level and, since 1990, there have been more deaths than births. Total
fertility declined from 2.1 to 1.9 live births per woman during the 1965-1990 period. The
crude death rate (12 per thousand) is on the rise, largely due to the aging of the population.
The aging process will reduce the 0-14 years age group from 19.9 percent of the total
population in 1990 to 17.9 percent in 2025; at the same time, the 65 years and above group
will increase from 13.5 to more than 21 percent.
1.6         Bulgaria is one of the few developed countries where life expectancy--one of
the most fundamental indicators of health status--has not increased significantly since 1970.
Life expectancy at birth for males has actually decreased (68.1 in 1962 and 68.0 in 1992)
while it increased for women (from 71.7 to 75.0 during the same time period). High rates of
internal migration have resulted in a 67 percent urbanization rate (46 percent in 1965) and a
high concentration in rural areas of elderly people who require more services. The health
status worsened in rural areas, due to lower quality of health services and deteriorating socio-
economic conditions which especially affect the elderly population. Ethnic minority groups
also have a poorer health status and less access to basic health care.
1.7         A review of health indicators shows that infant mortality is high (22nd out of
27 countries in Europe) and rising from 13.6 per 1,000 in 1988 to 15.9 in 1992. Similarly
maternal mortality is high (24th out of 27). Among women, besides the high maternal
mortality, a high standardized death rate (SDR) for cancer of the cervix, a highly preventable
disease, is noteworthy (21st out of 27). Due to the unavailability of modern contraceptives,
Bulgaria has one of the highest abortion rates in the world and, since the early 1970s,
abortions have outnumbered births (1.4 abortions per live birth in 1991). Immunization
rates, which were among the highest in Europe, have recently decreased. Among children,
the most frequent causes of death in 1992 were conditions of the perinatal period (29%),
congenital malformations (26%) and diseases of the respiratory system (24%).
1' For a more comprehensive analysis see Annex 2: The Health of the Bulgarian Population.
' The 1992 Census estimated the population at 8.485 million.



- 3 -
1.8          Overall, epidemiological conditions are characteristic of an aging population.
High mortality is explained by a very high SDR (0-64) for circulatory system diseases (25th
out of 27), with the highest SDR for cerebrovascular diseases in Europe. Diseases of the
circulatory system are major contributors to the increasing difference in mortality rates
between Bulgaria and Western EuropeY  In terms of morbidity, the most frequent reasons
for seeking health services in 1992 were: diseases of the digestive system (44%); diseases of
the nervous system (12%); diseases of the locomotion system (7%); diseases of the
respiratory system (7%); accidents, poisonings and violence (7%). More importantly,
however, the main causes of hospitalization4' confirm again the high prevalence and
seriousness of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in Bulgaria.
1.9          Finally, lifestyle is a major factor affecting mortality and morbidity patterns.
Tobacco consumption is on the rise in the population below 35 (especially in the 11-15 age
group) and among women and alcohol consumption is relatively high. The percentage of fat
in the diet, although below European average, is increasing. Finally, mortality from traffic
accidents and suicide correspond to European averages, but male mortality from injury and
poisoning is much higher. As in other Eastern European countries environment related
health problems seem to be concentrated in the most industrialized areas.
C. Health Care Organization and Financing-'
1.10         The Bulgarian health system is characteristic of most former socialist
economies, with: (i) tax-based financing; (ii) public sector provision of services;
(iii) universal access to comprehensive care; (iv) centralized planning and management;
(v) extensive infrastructure and staffing; and (vi) few incentives for consumers or providers
to increase efficiency, control costs and improve the quality of care. The public sector
health system is organized along the lines of district and municipal administration, and
consists of: (i) rural health posts, district health centers and urban polyclinics (freestanding
and hospital-based) for ambulatory care; (ii) municipal hospitals (250-300 beds each) and
district hospitals (1,000 beds each) for secondary care; and (iii) medical academies and a
wide variety of specialized hospitals and institutes for tertiary care. The public sector health
system also includes an extensive, but inefficient and ineffective, network of emergency

medical services (EMS), as well as a network of regional and district blood transfusion
centers and district-based Hygiene and Epidemiology Inspectorates (HEIs).
1.11        In addition, parallel health systems--financed out of general revenues but
restricted to specific social or occupational groups--are maintained by the Ministries of
Transport, Interior, Labor and Defense. Private sector health services were authorized in
1991 and have grown rapidly in the liberalized and largely unregulated pharmaceutical
sector, prompting the exodus of 40 percent of pharmacists from the public sector. At the
same time, the development of private medical services has been slowed by, among other
factors, the lack of an appropriate financing mechanism.
1.12        The most fundamental reform of the Bulgarian health system to date has been
the decentralization of management and financing of health facilities to the municipalities in
which they are located, including district hospitals and district-based, specialized institutes,
which have catchment areas extending beyond a single municipality. All local health
facilities have the legal status of municipal enterprises, limiting their managerial and financial
autonomy. National-level institutes and hospitals have the status of autonomous public
enterprises--with some falling under the supervision of the MOH. District and municipal
health services are financed almost exclusively from a municipal budget which is distinct
from the central, or republican budget. However, the municipal budget is dominated by
transfers from central budgetary revenues. A key issue following the decentralization of
health system management has been the need to match resources at the municipal level with
health care responsibilities, particularly when catchment areas extend beyond a single
municipality.
1.13        Despite the unprecedented economic and fiscal contraction, the Government
succeeded in maintaining--and even moderately increasing--aggregate real spending for health
during this period until 1992. This is in marked contrast to most other former socialist
economies, where economic contraction has resulted, to varying degrees, in compression of
real health expenditures. As a result, public spending for health rose as a share of GDP
from 3.4 percent in 1989 to a peak of 5.4 percent in 1992--a level which is not high by
Western European standards, but is in the upper range for countries at Bulgaria's income
level. Given the magnitude of the fiscal contraction, health expenditures nearly doubled as a
share of government spending, from 5.8 percent in 1989 to 11.9 percent in 1992. However,
fiscal pressures made spending cuts inevitable and health expenditures were trimmed to 5.1
percent of GDP in 1993, and 4.7 of GDP in 1994.

D. Major Issues for Health Sector Reform
Breakdown of Essential Health Services
1.14        Bulgaria is undergoing a difficult transition characterized by severe economic
dislocations, change from a centrally planned health system to a decentralized one, and an
attempt to move from a publicly financed and provided health services delivery system to a
publicly financed but both privately and publicly provided system. In line with the decline in
health indicators over the last few years, there is increasing evidence that essential services
have either deteriorated in quality or become too costly to sustain.
(i) Primary Health Care
1.15        In Bulgaria, the first point of contact in the public health system--Primary
Health Care (PHC)--is neither comprehensive, nor clearly differentiated from costly
emergency medical services. Provision of family medicine through general practitioners
and/or paramedical practitioners is a new concept. Physicians at the primary level tend to be
both overspecialized and unfamiliar with some elements of the basic package of PHC
services, particularly in the areas of disease prevention and health promotion.
1.16        Maternal and perinatal mortality are very high in Bulgaria due to a number of
factors such as: the low quality of perinatal care, the lack of appropriate follow up in the
case of high risk pregnancy, the difficulties in the emergency referral system, the poor
availability of modem contraceptive services, and the limited availability of blood products.
Improved management of obstetrical and neonatal care in PHC, with stronger linkage to
emergency services needs to be developed.
1.17        With the decentralization of health services, it has become increasingly
difficult for cash-strapped municipalities to ensure even a minimum level of service. Rapid
price increases have led to shortages of consumables and restrictions on utilities. Basic
maintenance of facilities and equipment is often not ensured. Lack of financial incentives
and essential supplies has demotivated medical staff, who have migrated toward the hospital
sector, leaving 1,400 positions vacant at the primary level. As a result, patients tend to
bypass the primary system, seeking less cost-effective treatment in hospitals.
1.18        The economic transition has intensified the need for comprehensive reform of
the health system. At the primary level, measures have been undertaken to train general
practitioners, as well as establish the legal and regulatory framework, and define new



- 6 -
reimbursement mechanisms, for private sector providers. Private outpatient services,
particularly for family medicine, are slowly emerging.6'
1.19        However, the public sector will continue to have an important role to play--
particularly in poorer, more isolated municipalities--in maintaining a minimum PHC network.
Maintaining this network, as part of the public sector social safety net, is crucial during the
economic transition, but also beyond, as evidence shows in well-established market
economies in Western Europe and elsewhere. If the public sector in Bulgaria is to fulfill its
responsibility to provide this key component of the social safety net, reforms in the structure,
scope and organization of primary health services are called for. Investments tightly linked
to measures aimed at improving the utilization of existing facilities and improving the
efficiency of services are also necessary.
(ii) Emergency Medical Services
1.20        Emergency medical services (EMS) play a pivotal role, allowing the
population direct access to critical care for life-threatening and other emergency situations.
They also link the PHC sector to more specialized levels of services, through organized
communication and transport. Beyond the usual response to, management and transport of
real emergencies, EMS in Bulgaria provide house calls and transport for routine non-
emergency care. These services could be handled more effectively and more efficiently by a
public or private PHC.
1.21        In a country where cardiovascular diseases and accidents are leading causes of
mortality, EMS are provided by a fragmented network of pre-hospital and hospital
institutions with no clear definition of responsibilities and linkages. No national standards
for the organization, financing, or quality of care of EMS are enforced. The low quality and
the inefficiency of the services provided has become even more obvious with the
decentralization of health care delivery and with the limitations of municipal budgets.
1.22        There is no separation between primary care and emergency services, and
emergency medical teams, both in mobile units and in health centers and small hospitals, de
facto cater in most cases (up to 85%) to a family practice type of demand, and handle few
critical emergencies. This vertical separation of clinical services leads to expensive
duplication. The concept of a unified, polyvalent emergency room does not exist, and
transfers to specialized services are not controlled.
1.23        The system is generously staffed, although the training of medical and non-
medical personnel is inappropriate. In large cities, pre-hospital medical teams are
overspecialized, as are most medical teams on call in hospitals. Non-medical staff and
9' The MOH estimated that at the end of 1993, some 1,000 private practices had opened.



- 7 -
medical teams in rural areas do not have the training required for handling simple emergency
cases. Finally, the system operates with a large, run down, ineffective fleet of ambulances
and other vehicles which frequently, as mentioned above, provide transport for elective, non-
urgent, and even convenience-based reasons.z'
1.24         The MOH has already undertaken to restructure and streamline the EMS
through the creation of a nation-wide, well-coordinated EMS network under national rather
than municipal jurisdiction. The introduction of the new system is expected to permit the
provision of quality EMS while operating with a significantly reduced number of vehicles
(about 450) and fewer, but appropriately-trained staff. A national consensus on reform was
reached through a consultative process between health professionals and municipal leaders.
The MOH has already received financial support from EU PHARE for the first phase of the
restructuring.
(iii) Blood Transfusion
1.25         The sector of transfusion is a vital element of any public heath care delivery
system. However, the present status of blood transfusion in Bulgaria does not meet basic
criteria such as an adequate supply of high quality blood and blood components, or ensure
adequate safety for blood donors and recipients.
1.26         The current technology for blood collection and processing is out-of-date and
presents a great hazard for transmission of infectious agents to both patients and health
personnel. The utilization of glass bottles as containers limits the volume of donated blood.
A simple switch to collection in plastic bags will increase the amount of blood collected from
the same number of donors by 12,000 liters and extend the shelf life by 24 days (i.e., will
decrease the amount of out-dated blood and increase the availability of blood components for
transfusion).
1.27         Improper processing and storage reduces the yield and activity of plasma
components such as antihemophilic globulin. Moreover, the utilization of glass bottles for
blood collection does not permit preparation of purified blood components such as
leukocyte-free red blood cells and platelets. This in turn eliminates the possibility of proper
treatment for patients undergoing chemotherapy for bone marrow or solid cancer.
Z' The fleet includes some 2,800 ambulances and cars. Virtually no investments have been made since
the 1970s and a large number of vehicles should be written off.
1/ The volume of blood collected in a glass bottle is 340 ml, as compared to 400 ml with plastic bag.
The shelf life of refrigerated blood collected in glass bottles is 21 days compared to 45 days for blood
collected in plastic bags.



- 8 -
1.28        Most transfusion equipment is obsolete and the situation is rapidly
deteriorating due to the lack of spare parts. Identification of donors and tests are handwritten,
increasing the risks of errors. Tests for hepatitis, which are too costly, are not performed.
Because of the lack of appropriate training, transfusion hematology does not comply with
international standards. For example, the main product which is transfused is whole blood.
This contradicts international standards and leads to loss of plasma which otherwise could be
used for fractionation and production of plasma components.
1.29        The network of transfusion centers is highly inefficient and needs to be
restructured. The current system comprises the National Center of Clinical and Transfusion
Hematology (NCCTH), 4 Regional Transfusion Hematology Centers (RTHCs) and 28
District Transfusion Centers. These centers are currently under the administrative and
financial control of municipalities, which makes it difficult to implement national policies and
enforce standards. Each district center is engaged in blood collection and rudimentary blood
processing, while blood banks exist in the major hospitals and in some regional hospitals. A
restructuring of this network and downsizing of institutions could lead to significant
efficiency gains.
1.30        Finally, the political, economic and social changes during the recent years
have had an extremely negative impact on blood donation. Incentives provided to donors
through the work place have all but disappeared, and as in other countries, there is a
reluctance on the part of the population to donate blood. The total number of donors
decreased from 44,000 in 1988 to 24,000 in 1992. A strategy to increase the number of
donors needs to be designed which involves all the major partners, including NGOs such as
the Bulgarian Red Cross, and an aggressive public information campaign must be supported.
Limited Emphasis on Health Promotion
1.31        Health promotion, including disease prevention, is recognized as one of the
most cost-effective approaches for reducing the incidence of many acute and chronic
diseases. Because health promotion has been largely ignored as an element in Bulgaria's
public health strategy, the population has access to insufficient and/or outdated information
on the relationships between lifestyle and health.
1.32        SDRs for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases in Bulgaria are among
the nighest in the world and rising, along with those for diabetes, cirrhosis, and cancers of
the lung, breast and digestive organs. The role which lifestyle factors play in increasing the
morbidity and premature mortality from these chronic diseases is well-established. These
factors are most prevalent in industrialized countries, and Bulgaria is no exception with a
relatively high-fat, high-sodium diet, a sedentary lifestyle, and widespread abuse of cigarettes
and alcohol. Cigarette smoking continues to rise--especially among young adults--increasing
manyfold the relative risk of not only lung cancer, but also cardiovascular disease.



- 9 -
Inefficient Allocation and Utilization of Resources
1.33        The public health care delivery system, generously endowed with physical
facilities and staff, is characterized by widespread inefficiency. With 3.1 physicians and
12.3 hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants, and a primary care center for every 2,400
inhabitants, Bulgaria has medical staffing and service capacity which are at the high end of
the range for both Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries and countries with
established market economies. The existence of parallel delivery systems, maintained by
other Ministries such as the Ministry of Defense or the Ministry of Transports makes it also
difficult for MOH to control investments in the sector. This system places a heavy fiscal
burden on a country where per capita income and government revenues have contracted
significantly over a very short period of time.
1.34        Tax-based health systems such as Bulgaria's offer the advantages of facilitating
universal access to care and minimizing financial risk for health care consumers. However,
budget allocations to facilities are based largely on historical levels of fixed and quasi-fixed
inputs: number of facilities, beds and staff. Allocations do not reflect anticipated service
volume, nor have they been adjusted to take into account shifting patterns of service
utilization in recent years. As a result, the existing budgetary system suffers from: (i) few
incentives for cost consciousness among consumers, who pay no out-of-pocket costs for care;
(ii) no transfer of financial risk (or reward) to providers in order to create incentives to
improve efficiency, consolidate redundant services and improve quality to attract clientele;
and (iii) no reimbursement mechanism for private services which will foster private sector
development.
1.35        It is clear that inefficient allocation of resources is limiting the effectiveness of
the system in preventing and reversing recent declines in health status. Increased efficiency
in resource use is necessary to enhance both the effectiveness of the system in protecting the
health of the population, and its fiscal sustainability. In the absence of more fundamental
financial reform, the Ministries of Health and Finance have sought to improve the existing
system of municipal budgeting by developing "objective criteria" to determine municipal
transfers. However, the methodology is applied to only a small share (11 percent in 1994)
of aggregate municipal transfers, resulting in little reallocation of resources relative to the
past. Facility and personnel norms have also been established to guide restructuring, but are
not based on an analysis of service utilization either in Bulgaria or in other countries.
1.36        In the longer run, adoption of contributory national health insurance legislation
has tended to be viewed as a panacea for health financing and management problems.
However, the draft legislation which was submitted to Parliament fails to take into account
the extremely limited scope for additional payroll taxation as a source of new revenues. It
also does not define specific reimbursement mechanisms. Some type of contracting between
providers and insurers is assumed, and yet the development of new reimbursement
mechanisms which will determine the incentives for increased efficiency, improved quality of



- 10 -
care and development of private health services. Without first defining these reimbursement
mechanisms, it is difficult to assess the impact of introducing health insurance on the demand
and supply of services, and on public spending for health.
1.37        Legitimate concerns about uncontrolled cost escalation--particularly at a time
of severe fiscal austerity--have reduced the political urgency of adopting health insurance
legislation. In the meantime, the National Center for Health Informatics (NCHI) and the
National Insurance Research and Development Center (NIRDC) have begun to develop
necessary accounting systems and define and test new reimbursement mechanisms for health
services. For the past few years, the NCHI has introduced simple cost accounting (by ward
and by expenditure category) in municipal and district hospitals and polyclinics to
complement patient and utilization data traditionally collected for the health information
system. While the financial accounting system is in an early phase--with associated problems
of data reliability and data processing capabilities--it does provide a sufficient basis for
calculating average costs, developing simple, cost-based reimbursement mechanisms and
making efficiency comparisons.
1.38        The MOH intends to carry out pilot activities to improve district resource
allocation, by using existing financial and service utilization data to: (i) identify the potential
for streamlining public health services; and (ii) develop reimbursement mechanisms which
create financial incentives for efficient resource allocation. These pilot activities will
require changes in the relationship between the municipal government and health facilities.
A draft proposal has been prepared and submitted to Parliament to test a number of
contracting systems between health facilities and municipalities (in an initial stage) and
among health facilities, the proposed health insurance administration, and municipalities or
client groups (in a later stage). Such systems will require, inter alia, change in the legal
status of health facilities and development of more sophisticated cost parameters on which to
base reimbursement.
1.39        Building on the work of the NCHI, the NIRDC has outlined a medium-term
strategy to introduce a case-mix, diagnosis-related approach to hospital reimbursement,
based on grouping of patients according to ICD-9 categories. Successful implementation will
require refinement of the cost accounting system, strengthening of financial analysis, and
development of more complex administrative mechanisms.
1.40        Further measures are necessary to: (i) determine priorities for resource
allocation based on Bulgaria's disease profile; (ii) define an action plan to streamline and
rationalize the public health system, and facilitate the development of private sector
providers; (iii) improve financial management, diversify sources of revenue; and (iv) develop
new reimbursement mechanisms for outpatient care, particularly to strengthen primary care
and support the emergence of private sector general practitioners.

E. Government Strategy in the Health Sector
1.41        Over the past few years, the Government has started to introduce a number of
reforms aimed at improving the quality of health care and promoting new financing
arrangements. First, legislation was enacted to allow private practice for physicians, dentists
and pharmacists. Second, the health care delivery system has been decentralized with
municipalities assuming major responsibility for the management of health facilities. Third,
enrollments in medical schools have been limited, and new programs are being developed, in
particular with regard to the training of general practitioners. Finally, legislation has been
prepared for the introduction a national health insurance scheme. The thrust of the reform
program is to establish the basis for a mixed system of health care delivery, funded in large
part through a contributory health insurance scheme, the main characteristics of which are
still being debated.
1.42        More recently, the Government has defined the main orientations of a
comprehensive reform strategy for the health sector. The main building blocks of this policy
framework, as they appear in a Policy Statement of the Ministry of Health, provided in
Annex 4, are: (i) streamlining the network of public health facilities, through a
reorganization of health services at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels;
(ii) restructuring and strengthening essential public health services such as primary care,
emergency care and blood transfusion; (iii) developing financing mechanisms which will
provide incentives for cost containment and quality of care with a view to prepare the
introduction of the national health insurance scheme in the medium term; (iv) eliminating
bottlenecks in the supply of critical inputs, especially drugs; and (v) reforming the medical
profession with regard to training, working conditions and remuneration.
1.43        These are a few of the reform initiatives currently being considered or
underway. While largely positive, they need to be further refined and integrated in a
comprehensive strategy for health system reform, around which a national consensus must be
developed. The MOH has requested assistance from WHO EURO to define a new strategy
for health care. Over the next few years, a tremendous effort will be needed on the part of
the MOH, research institutes, and the medical community to define detailed objectives,
analyze policy options, recommend reforms, formulate implementation strategies, and
educate the public, government officials and lawmakers on policy options and
recommendations. In particular, the MOH, with overall responsibility for development and
implementation of health policy, has a formidable task ahead in linking strategic options to
agreed objectives, and building a national consensus through public awareness and social
marketing of proposed reforms.

F. Bank Lending Strategy and Experience
1.44        Rationale for Bank Involvement. Bulgaria faces the challenge of adapting its
health care delivery system to the new requirements of a country in transition. While the
Government has clearly identified the most important policy changes, up to now it has not
been able to translate them into concrete programs and investments. As a result, very little
restructuring has taken place over the past three years. The proposed investments will assist
the MOH in structuring its approach through support of key reforms in primary health care,
emergency services and blood transfusion, which are the main pillars of modem medicine,
and will initiate longer-term reforms in health care organization and financing.
1.45        The Bank has assumed a leading role in helping Bulgaria in the transition to a
market economy and in foreign assistance coordination. The Bank's strategy in the social
sectors is to support the development of policies and programs aimed at ensuring both a
fiscally viable social safety net and the reorientation of the country's human capital
production systems to the new requirements of democratic and market economies.
Continuing access to quality health care, especially by underprivileged groups, at an
acceptable cost to the individual and the community, is an essential element of the social
safety net, providing ample justification for Bank's involvement in this sector. Moreover,
the Bank can mobilize and apply significant expertise for the restructuring of the health
sector and its adjustment to the fiscal contraction.
1.46        Bank Lending in the Social Sectors. The Bank's initial economic work in
Bulgaria included a preliminary review of the situation in health sector.9' The Technical
Assistance Loan,'-' the Bank's first lending operation in Bulgaria, provided for several
consultancies in the health sector. The Bank prepared internally a development strategy for
the social sectors in early 1992 (which was presented in 1993 at the Bulgaria Consultative
Group meeting), designed to ensure that these sectors will play a constructive role in the
process of transformation to the market economy. The strategy focusses on the development
of an affordable and targeted social safety net with minimal adverse labor market incentives,
and of improved human capital to support the transition to a market economy. It provided
for the development of investment projects, dealing respectively with education, employment
and social protection, and health.
1.47        The proposed Project is consistent with the draft Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) -- both of which are being presented to the Executive Directors simultaneously. It
will promote the necessary adjustments in the health care system, while at the same time

providing urgent investments aimed at protecting key health services which are part of the
safety net and are essential for developing the country's human capital. Moreover, the
reforms introduced through the project support a more rational utilization of resources,
reducing the risk of fiscal explosion in the social sectors. The present project also builds on
knowledge derived from ongoing projects in the sector and in the region, most notably in
Poland, Hungary and Romania. It also builds on assistance already being provided in
Bulgaria by EU PHARE.
G. Aid Coordination
1.48        Support from other donors is generally focused on technical assistance in a
wide range of programs. WHO plays a significant role in advising the MOH on public
health strategies in general and on health promotion and health prevention in particular. The
MOH has already received significant assistance from the European Union. In March 1992,
EU PHARE committed 15 million ECU for upgrading emergency medical services, training
general practitioners, and providing technical assistance in the area of health insurance and
drug policy. In May 1993, EU PHARE provided another 10.5 million ECU for follow up
activities in the area of health insurance, training of health personnel as well as preventive
medicine and private medical practice. The implementation of these programs has been
satisfactory, and the Bank has received significant assistance from the EU PHARE project
coordinating unit in the course of the preparation of this project. Moreover, the proposed
project complements the investments made by EU PHARE.

II. THE FRO.lECT
A. Project Objectives
2.1         The overall objective of the project is to prevent further deterioration in the
health status of the population, while at the same time improving the efficiency of the health
care delivery system. More specifically the objectives of the project are to: (i) facilitate the
restructuring of the health sector by strengthening the policy analysis and management
capacity in the sector; and (ii) protect the population at large--and vulnerable groups in
particular--by ensuring continuing provision of essential health services during the transition
period and beyond.
B. Project Description
2.2         The Project will provide specialist advisory assistance, overseas and local
training, study visits, consumables, equipment, computer hardware and software, facilities
rehabilitation, and incremental recurrent expenditures (US$41.3 million equivalent base cost,
and US$47.1 million equivalent including contingencies, taxes and duties). It will be
implemented over a period of five years by the MOH and concemed Municipalities. The
proposed Project consists of the following four components:
A. Policy Analysis and Management
B. Primary Health Care
C. Emergency Medical Services
D. Blood Transfusion
Policy Analvsis and Management (US$2.5 million, base cost)
2.3         The objective of this component is to strengthen the capacity of the MOH and
health institutions to analyze policy options, implement the National Health Strategy Action
Plan developed jointly with WHO, manage health resources, and disseminate information
about proposed reforms to lawmakers, decision-makers and the public. Prior to
negotiations, the Government finalized a Health Policy Statement (Annex 4), summarizing
the main policy directions for the health sector, and incorporating the views of both the
Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance. (Annex 4). Specifically, the component
will support MOH and its associated institutions in their efforts to: (i) de.termine priorities for
resource allocation based on Bulgaria's disease profile; (ii) define an action plan to
streamline and rationalize the public sector health system; and (iii) improve financial



- 16 -
management, diversify sources of revenue, and develop new reimbursement mechanisms for
health services.
2.4         The component will finance long-term and short-term fellowships to
strengthen the capacity of the MOH and associated institutions to implement reform strategies
in the areas of: (i) health planning and health system management; (ii) health economics and
finance; (iii) health education and communications; and (iv) pharmaceutical policy and the
economics of the pharmaceutical market. Several fellowship candidates will serve as core
members of a strengthened Economic Analysis Unit (EAU) in the MOH. The EAU will be a
technical unit to assist the MOH in analyzing policy options related to health finance,
resource allocation and expenditures. It will also be a locus for organizing and disseminating
information, in order to build broad consensus on health policy reforms and health system
restructuring. Fellowship candidates from five national health institutes will also form a
technical team to assist local authorities in defining regional restructuring plans for the public
sector health system. In addition to fellowships, several study tours will be organized to
allow technicians and policy-makers to assess implementation of health reforms in other
countries.
2.5         Short-term local training programs will also be developed under this
component. Training will focus on building capacity for health planning and health system
management among MOH personnel, regional and municipal health administrators and
hospital directors. Fellowship candidates will serve as a core team of trainers for carrying
out short-term seminars nationwide.
2.6         The component will also finance consultant services to strengthen capacity for
analysis and implementation of reform. A Health Finance Advisor will provide long-term
support to the Economic Analysis Unit in carrying out its functions. In addition, short-term
consulting services will be provided to support a limited number of policy studies/exercises:
(i)    a study on priorities for health will be carried out to examine the burden of
disease in Bulgaria and its implications on public spending in the health sector;
(ii)  an exercise will be carried out to define restructuring programs for the public
sector health system in two pilot regions, and develop a methodology which
can subsequently be applied in other regions, with assistance from the national
technical team described above. The exercise will rely on cost and utilization
data deriving from the pilot cost accounting system introduced over the past
three years;
(iii) pilot activities will be continued to test a methodology for flexible budgeting of
health facilities through contracting arrangements between municipalities and
the facilities explicitly linking budget allocations to service volume. Flexible
budgeting through contracting will be the first step toward



- 17 -
longer-term development of a case-mix diagnosis-related reimbursement
mechanism for health services; and
(iv) a study will be carried out to determine the financial implications of alternative
packages for health services to be covered by the proposed health insurance
system.
2.7         The component will also finance computer software and hardware. as well as
basic office equipment to support the Economic Analysis Unit and the network of Regional
Health Centers. Strengthening the data processing capabilities in Regional Health Centers is
essential for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of health sector reforms. It will
be critical for applying the methodologies developed under the regional restructuring and
flexible budgeting exercises (see above) on a nationwide basis during the project
implementation period. Municipalities will be required to make a commitment to adopt these
methodologies and resulting recommendations in order to benefit from investments in
primary health care under the project.
2.8         The Policy Analysis and Management component will also support information
activities to build a national consensus on health sector reform. On the basis of the Policy
Statement prepared by MOH, the National Strategy for Health Care (developed with the
support of WHO) and the burden of disease analysis supported under the project, the
Economic Analysis Unit will prepare public information documents which summarize policy
orientations in the sector, priorities for allocation of resources, major issues for reform,
measures underway to address these issues and the plan of action to define and implement
further reforms. These documents will provide the basis for information campaigns--through
seminars, conferences, press releases, etc.--targeted at lawmakers, government decision-
makers and the public.
2.9         Finally, this component will finance office equipment, one vehicle and the
operating costs, including expenses for field monitoring and supervision, for the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU), as well as technical assistance and training for procurement,
record-keeping and auditing for both the PCU and the Department of Equipment (DEQ).
2.10        During negotiations the MOH confirmed that:
(i)  the Economic Analysis Unit in the MOH will be staffed with four full-time,
gualified health policy analysts (no later than June 30. 1996) (para. 5. 1; and
(ii)  an annual review of the health sector budget, including assessment of the
priority public investment program (domestically- and externally-funded
projects) for health, will be conducted jointly with the Bank. in order to ensure
resource reallocation in line with priorities stated in the Health Policy
Statement. (para. 5.1).



- 18 -
PrimarY Health Care (US$14.5 million, base cost)
2.11         The objective of this component is to improve the quality and scope of primary
health care in selected municipalities which are committed to the reform of health services
delivery and financing, and efficiency improvement through better utilization of available
resources and existing facilities. This will allow emergency medical services to be
discharged of PHC responsibilities, particularly for home visits, and set the stage for
progressive introduction of changes in public/private delivery of services.
2.12         To achieve these objectives, the project will support the implementation of a
package of essential PHC services in up to 75 municipalities in the 7 districts (Phase 1) and
14 Districts (Phase 2) to be covered by the emergency medical services. This package will
include : (i) basic, high quality, round-the-clock curative care targeted at the most common
health complaints and delivered to the whole municipal population; (ii) preventive care in the
area of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) including family planning, maternal and perinatal
care, infant growth monitoring and immunization; particular attention will also be given to
screening for cervical, and possibly breast, cancer; (iii) other preventive activities
implemented in accordance with national health policies, in particular cardio-vascular
diseases, tuberculosis, acute respiratory infections, sexually transmitted diseases, and
accidents; (iv) municipal health promotion activities to address priority problems (tobacco,
drugs and alcohol abuse, injuries and poisonings, dietary habits, abortion) mainly through the
promotion of better life-styles.
2.13         The project will facilitate, through provision of TA to selected municipalities,
the preparation and implementation of specific plans aimed at improving the quality and
effectiveness of the PHC network. These plans will pay specific attention to under-served
areas and seek a better distribution of human, financial and physical resources. Plans will
address the issues of improvement of quality of services as well as full time coverage of the
population. In the municipal plans, priority will be given to health units located in difficult
or remote areas as well as the infrastructure essential for the implementation of the main
PHC programs at the municipal level.
2.14         The project will target up to 75 municipalities located in 21 districts and
selected on the basis of the following criteria: (i) commitment to the proposed reform and
readiness to introduce the standard PHC package designed under the project; (ii) priority to
under-privileged, low-income areas within the selected municipalities; (iii) willingness to
downsize their health care delivery system; (iv) agreement to financially participate in the
project in particular with regard to rehabilitation and furnishing of PHC centers, and
remuneration of staff providing 24-hour coverage; (v) agreement to allocate vehicles to the
structures for home visits; and (vi) willingness to utilize suitable buildings, with acceptable
standards of water, electricity and heating systems. Activities will be launched in the first
year in the seven Districts already selected (Pleven, Plovdiv, Varna, Dobrich, Pazardjik,
Shumen, Smoljan). The remaining fourteen Districts will be phased in during year 3 of the



- 19 -
Project (Lovetch, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Haskovo, Kardjali, Russe, Montana,
Targovishte, Stara Zagora, Razgrad, Silistra, Vidin, Vratza, Blagoevgrad).
2.15        The project will finance minor rehabilitation for up to 270 local health centers
and 42 polyclinics, equipment and furniture for these facilities. It will also finance technical
assistance to: (i) assist MOH and Municipal Councils to plan PHC activities, design and
implement the new package of PHC services (focusing on quality of care, efficiency,
organization of 24-hour service, and health promotion) and evaluate its impact; and (ii) help
prepare curricula and programs for re-training medical doctors, nurses and other health and
social workers; (iii) develop and implement well targeted municipal health promotion
activities. Contractual agreements, defining the rights and obligations of the respective
parties, and be signed between the Municipalities and the MOH.
2.16        Finally, the project will finance training and continuing education programs to
enhance the skills of PHC personnel working in the municipalities, including: (i) PHC
physicians, with the collaboration inter alia of the four Training Centers for General
Practitioners supported by the EU PHARE program; (ii) midwives, nurses and other health
and social workers in the PHC sector, with the collaboration of local nursing and social work
schools; and (iii) a limited number of fellowships and study tours in key PHC areas.
Periodic seminars and/or workshops for information and exchange of experience gained by
local health authorities will also be organized.
2.17        During negotiations. the Government confirmed:
(i)   that contractual agreements will be signed between Municipalities and the
MOH. for the purpose of implementing the PHC component (no later than
December 31. 1996) (para. 5. 1); and
(ii)  the MOH Primary Health Care Unit will be strengthened with two additional
full time professionals, to assist in the implementation of the primary health
care component (no later than June 30. 1996) (para. 5.1).
Emergency Medical Services (US$13.3 million, base cost)
2.18        The objective of this component is to support ongoing efforts by MOH to
restructure emergency medical services (EMS) and improve the effectiveness and efficiency
of service delivery. It also aims at improving the interface between EMS and primary health
care services, and hospitals.
2.19        An effective and efficient EMS system is characterized by: (a) rapid access by
the population and by primary health care staff to a national telecommunications network that
can process calls, counsel or refer the caller, or promptly dispatch either advanced medical
response tearns or basic life support ambulances; (b) rapid, efficient, on-site treatment and if



- 20 -
required, transport without delay to an appropriate health care institution; (c) properly
equipped, multidisciplinary and multifunctional emergency rooms in the appropriate
community or district hospital; and (d) medical staff with specialized training in the treatment
of the full range of clinical emergencies, and with the support from well-trained paramedical
staff.
2.20        The restructuring of EMS supported under the project will: (i) separate the
functions of EMS from those of the PHC network, while ensuring continuous access to
medical care for the population; (ii) consolidate and effectively manage a three-tier national
network, which permits the coordination of service delivery and streamlining of patient
transfer mechanisms; (iii) improve pre-hospital outreach capacity through the efficient use of
a two-tier fleet of vehicles with adequately trained advanced and basic-level emergency
teams; (iv) introduce the concept of a multidisciplinary emergency room in order to optimize
efficiency in receiving and stabilizing acute cases; and (v) build the capacity of the system to
monitor its own performance.
2.21        The MOH has adopted a gradual approach to restructuring of the EMS
network. Under the proposed project a total of 21 Districts will be covered. Decrees of the
Council of Ministers were passed in February 1994, September 1994, and October 1995,
introducing the new system in the concemed districts. Detailed regulations defining the
structure and functions of the system were issued by the MOH in May 1994. Initial support
for this program is being provided by EU-PHARE, which is financing the national
telecommunications network, some vehicles, equipment and technical assistance, as well as
training. Implementation has already started in the first 14 districts, and protocols which
specify the assets and staff being transferred from Municipalities to the MOH have been
signed.
2.22        The project will finance minor civil works for base stations at the periphery
and minor civil works and equipment for two types of emergency rooms (21 regional hospital
and 45 community hospital emergency rooms). In addition, it will finance 29 properly
equipped intervention vehicles for the medical teams, and 96 ambulances for the basic life
support teams in the pre-hospital services (provided on the basis of one new vehicle for two
non-functioning vehicles being written off).
2.23        The project will also finance consultant services to support the EMS unit
within the MOH Department of Specialized Health Care (DSHC) in completing the
conception, coordinating the implementation, and managing the EMS. In addition, technical
assistance will support the conception and implementation, at the national and district levels,
of a computerized monitoring system of clinical, operational, and financial data to assess the
system's performance. Finally, training of medical, paramedical and administrative staff and
drivers, and special training in emergency medicine for PHC physicians in the periphery will
be provided.



- 21 -
2.24        During negotiations. the Govemment confirmed that:
(i)   protocols. which specify assets and staff to be transferred in the context of the
creation of the National Emergency Medical Services will be signed between
the MOH and the remaining Municipalities (no later than December 31. 1996)
(para. 5.1!; and
(ii)  for every new vehicle purchased for emergency medical services under the
proposed component, two non-functioning emergency vehicles will be written
off (para. 5.1).
Blood Transfusion (US$10.6 million, base cost)
2.25        The objective of this component is to improve the supply and quality of blood
and blood products by restructuring and rehabilitating the network of blood transfusion
centers, introducing safer and more up-to-date technology, and promoting the recruitment
of new donors.
2.26        The project will assist the MOH in re-centralizing the system of blood
transfusion and hematology, thereby concentrating the main blood processing and quality
control activities in only four Regional Transfusion Centers. This will allow a downsizing of
the network, with smaller centers performing only blood collection functions, and other
functions gradually being phased out. It will support the introduction of more up-to-date and
safer technology for blood collection and processing, and upgrade blood processing to current
standards of Council of Europe and other international organizations. Finally, the National
Donor Recruitment Program will be reorganized with the participation of non-governmental
organizations.
2.27        The project will finance minor civil works to renovate existing facilities of the
National Center for Clinical and Transfusion Hematology (NCCTH) and the five Regional
Transfusion Hematology Centers (RTHCs) in Sofia, Plovdiv, Pleven, Stara Zagora, and
Varna. Before negotiations, the MOH presented a physical survey, undertaken by qualified
engineers/architects, of the facilities to be upgraded under this component and provided cost
estimates for civil works. The component will also finance the provision of modem
equipment consistent with Council of Europe standards, as well as consultant services, and
state-of-the-art materials and mass media campaigns to reorganize the blood donor
recruitment program. Finally, training programs for health personnel engaged in donor
recruitment, public relations, blood collection and processing, and quality control will be
provided for in addition to overseas fellowships.
2.28        The MOH has already started the implementation of the proposed strategy by
financing, from its own budget, the provision of plastic bags for the entire network.
Moreover, in March 1994, the Parliament passed the Law for Blood Donation and for the



- 22 -
use of Blood and Blood Components. The MOH has passed a decree, transferring the
responsibility for blood transfusion and hematology from the Municipalities to the MOH.
Protocols, specifying the assets and the staff being transferred from the concerned
municipalities to the MOH, will also be signed.
2.29        During negotiations. the Government confirmed that:
protocols, which specify assets and staff to be transferred in the context of the
creation of National Blood Transfusion Service will be signed between the
MOH and the concerned Municipalities (no later than December 31, 1996)
(para. 5.1).
C. Project Economic Justification
2.30        The project will have three major benefits. It will: (i) improve health status;
(ii) improve equity and reduce poverty; (iii) increase efficiency in the health sector; and
(iv) improve fiscal balance and promote macro-economic stability by containing cost
escalation in the health sector.
2.31        Improve Health Status. Improvements in health status will contribute to
economic growth and increased life time income for individuals through the impact of
improved health status on labor productivity, fewer work loss days, a longer working life,
increased ability of individuals to obtain better jobs, and (through the positive interaction of
health and education) increased enrollment and improved ability to learn.
2.32        Current health outcomes in Bulgaria are amongst the lowest in Europe. In
marked contrast to international trends, life expectancy has actually declined over the past 25
years as a result of premature death from chronic diseases associated with unhealthy life
styles. Life expectancy for males, in particular, has declined between 1960 and 1992. Adult
mortality rates from cardio-vascular disease are the second highest in Europe while mortality
rates from cerebro-vascular disease are the highest in the region. Infant mortality rates are
the sixth highest in Europe and the long-term downward trend has worsened during the
transition. This is due, in part, to the re-emergence of infectious diseases. The country has
recently gone through major measles (1992) and tuberculosis (1990) epidemics. Maternal
mortality rates are third highest in the region, while mortality from cervical cancer have been
increasing and are the seventh highest in Europe.
2.33        The project will improve health status by the most cost effective method:
strengthening preventive and curative care at the primary level to address the leading causes
of high mortality rates in infants, children and adults. The primary health care component
will improve the quality and availability of matemal and child health care, a cost effective



- 23 -
way to reduce pre-natal problems, acute respiratory infections and other infectious and
parasitic diseases which are the leading cause of infant death. Increased access to selected
services for family planning and improved pregnancy related care (pre-natal, child,
post-partum) also included in the primary health care component should reduce the
prevalence of unsafe abortions, as well as inadequacies in pre-natal and post-partum care, the
emergency referral system, and the management of high risk pregnancies, the main factors
contributing to high maternal mortality rates. High female mortality rates from cervical
cancer will be addressed through cost effective cervical screening procedures. High and
increasing adult mortality rates, mainly the result of cardio- and cerebro-vascular disease,
will be reduced through interventions such as the provision of nutrition information and
health promotion efforts geared to reduce high-fat diets, tobacco and alcohol consumption-
leading risk factors for these diseases in adults. Health promotion efforts aimed at accident
prevention should also reduce accidents, the leading cause of death among children 1-14
years of age. Improvements in immunization services (also a part of the primary health care
component) will stem the decline in immunization rates and reduce negative externalities
from infectious diseases.
2.34        Improvements in the quality and quantity of blood, a critical part of the blood
services component, will also have direct impact on improving health status by reducing the
negative externalities from communicable diseases (i.e., STD, hepatitis B). Shifting the
focus of emergency services away from routine care to emergency cases, a major objective
of the emergency services component, should reduce maternal, infant and adult mortality
rates by decreasing the response time to cardio-vascular and ischemic problems, accidents,
and complications arising from high risk pregnancies. Interventions in emergency care and
blood supply systems will provide complementary inputs critical to an effective health care
delivery system.
2.35        Improve Equity and Reduce Poverty. The primary health care component of
the project will identify low income areas as a criterion for site selection for the delivery of
the primary health care package. Bulgaria has higher poverty rates in rural areas, which are
under-served by health services. These areas have a greater incidence of the four leading
causes of both infant and child mortality (congenital malformation, pre-natal problems (only
infant), respiratory disease, infectious and parasitic diseases) relative to urban areas, and
therefore stand to gain the most in economic terms from improvements in health status.
2.36        Increase Efficiency in the Health Sector. Increasing the emphasis on health
promotion activities and most importantly, improving the quality and scope of the existing
primary health care network in order to reduce substitution towards expensive tertiary care,
will increase the efficiency in the health sector.
2.37        The project will also generate efficiency gains in the health sector by
restructuring emergency medical services and blood transfusion and haematology services,
currently two extremely inefficient inputs in the health care system. Streamlining and de-

linking of costly emergency services from the primary health package (in the emergency
medical services component), down-sizing and consolidation of the network of blood
transfusion and haematology centers (by consolidating the network into five regional centers
and phasing out other functions at the prephery (in the blood services component) should
improve service delivery and input utilization of the health sector.
2.38        Improving the policy analysis and management capability of the health sector
will yield efficiency gains by improving financial management and reallocating health sector
resources based on burden of disease analysis. The policy analysis and management
component supports the develpment and implementation of District Restructuring Plans which
will result in the consolidation of the public sector health network and reduction of excess
capacity.
2.39        Improve Fiscal Balance. The project supports the development of new
reimbursement mechanisms which will create incentives for efficiency and cost containment,
as well as promote private sector entry into the health care market. The policy component of
the project will provide support for assessing the financial implications of alternative
packages for health services to be covered by the proposed health insurance system and into
alternative sources of revenue (rather than payroll tax increases) to support this sytem. This
study will assist the Government in selecting a national health insurance scheme--a
mechanism that would reduce risk and promote economic welfare--on efficiency and
budgetary grounds. This would avoid the potential escalation of health costs from the
provision of health insurance, thereby averting an adverse impact on fiscal balance and
macro-economic stability.
D. Environmental ImDact
2.40        No adverse impact on the environment is expected from the project (screening
category C). Particular attention has been paid in project design to ensure adequate disposal
of sanitary, medical and laboratory waste. The Project has been classified as C: "No
appreciable environmental impact."

m. COST. FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Introduction
3.1            This chapter summarizes the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) which is
attached as Annex 1. The PIP describes the operational details for implementing the Project
and outlines the project content, its inputs, costs and financing plan, disbursements,
implementation and coordination responsibilities, procurement arrangements, and reporting,
performance monitoring and evaluation procedures. The PIP was prepared at appraisal and
updated during negotiations and reflects detailed implementation arrangements agreed with
the Ministry of Health (MOH).
B. Project Cost
3.2            The total cost of the Health Sector Restructuring Project is estimated at 5.3
billion Bulgaria Leva or US$47.1 million equivalent including contingencies, taxes and
duties. The base cost is estimated at about US$41.3 million. Physical contingencies amount
to US$3.4 million, and price contingencies between negotiations (November 1995) and the
end of the five year project implementation period are estimated at US$2.5 million. Total
contingencies (US$5.9 million) represent 14 percent of the base cost. The direct and indirect
foreign exchange component of the Project is estimated at US$30.5 million, including
contingencies, or 65 percent of total project cost. Taxes and duties on goods and works are
estimated at US$4.2 million equivalent. Technical assistance expenditures will be tax
exempt. The Project cost summary by component is shown below in Table 3.1.

3.3           The project cost includes technical assistance (specialists, studies, fellowships
and training), equipment (health care, laboratory, computers, office), vehicles, software
(computer applications, books, training materials, copyrights), refurbishing of health
facilities, and incremental recurrent costsW generated by the Project. Detailed project costs
by category of expenditure are shown in Table 2, Annex 1.
C. Project Financin
3.4           The Project will be financed by a Bank Loan of US$26.0 million, a Grant
from EU PHARE of US$2.3 million equivalent, a Loan from the Council of Europe Social
Development Fund (CEF) of US$11.0 million equivalent, and counterpart funds from the
Bulgarian Government equivalent to US$7.8 million. The proposed Bank Loan of US$26.0
million will finance 85 percent of the direct and indirect foreign exchange. Total Bank
financing will represent about 61 percent of total project cost net of taxes. For risk
management considerations, the Government selected a currency pool loan for this Project.
The Government has already obtained the EU PHARE Grant, and intends to sign a separate
loan agreement with CEF for the CEF Loan. All duties and taxes under the Project will be
financed by the Government. A Japan Grant of US$500,000 equivalent was made available
to contract critical specialist services and procure equipment necessary for project
preparation. The financing arrangements are shown in Table 3.2 below.
3.5           As a condition of effectiveness of the Bank Loan. all conditions to th
effectiveness of the CEF Loan, other than the effectiveness of the Bank Loan, will be met.

." Incremental recurrent costs are due primarily to operational and maintenance costs of emergency
vehicles and equipment for hematology centers. No incremental costs from additional staffing is foreseen.
Averaged over five years, the yearly requirement represents less than one percent of the projected 1994
total Government budget for the health sector and is deemed sustainable.

D. Project Management and Implementation
3.6         The MOH will have overall responsibility for the implementation of the
Project. The Project has been designed to fit the implementation and absorptive capacity of
the MOH. From the operational point of view, and in line with the Project's capacity
building objectives, the Project wilL be implemented by MOH line departments, sector
institutions, and health care units in the municipalities, assisted by qualified specialists as
necessary. Day-to-day coordination of Project-related activities will be the responsibility of
the Project Management Unit (PMU) in the MOH.
3.7         A Project Coordination Committee (PCC)L' has been established within MOH
to oversee project implementation, provide guidance and advice to the PMU, and to ensure
that project objectives remain consistent with national health policy and priorities. Chaired
by the Minister of Health, the PCC includes the heads of the PMU, MOH Departments and
sector institutions involved in the Project, and representatives of the Ministry of Finance.
The PMU will have overall responsibility for procurement, will coordinate with the MOH
Department of Construction for the procurement of civil works rehabilitation and upgrading,
and with the MOH Economic and Finance Department for the procurement of goods
(equipment, vehicles, materials). The PMU will be responsible for the management of
project funds. Staffing of the PMU include a Project Director, Deputy Director to
coordinate the technical assistance program, Procurement Officer, Financial Officer, and
support staff.
3.8         During negotiations the MOH confirmed that:
(i)   the PCC will be maintained throughout project implementation (para. 5.1): and
(ii)  the Director of the PMU and four full-time staff will be maintained throughout
proiect implementation with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank (para.
E. Procurement Arrangements
3.9         Goods procured under the Project will be grouped into major packages to
encourage competitive bidding and permit bulk procurement. The Bank has prepared
Standard Bidding Documents which will be adapted for the Project's specific requirements.
Procurement of goods will be in accordance with the January 1995 Bank Guidelines -
12' The PCC was established on July 11, 1994, by a circular decree issued by the Minister of Health.



- 28 -
Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits . Technical assistance, fellowships, and
training contracts will be procured in accordance with the August 1981 Guidelines - Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency .
Procurement of civil works and furniture contracts which are to be financed by CEF will be
undertaken in accordance with procedures agreed between the Government and CEF.
Procurement of technical assistance, equipment and materials under the Policy Analysis Sub-
Component of Component 1, which will be financed by EU PHARE, will be contracted in
accordance with procedures agreed between the Government and EU PHARE. Items of
recurrent expenditure, which will be financed entirely by the Government, will be contracted
in accordance with regular Government procedures. The major procurement categories
include: about US$16.3 million of contracts for goods and vehicles awarded through
international competitive bidding procedures; US$2.5 million through international shopping;
and US$6.0 million from UNICEF (medical supplies and basic medical equipment for
primary health care); and US$300,000 through direct contracting (books, software,
intellectual property). Contracts for technical assistance, fellowships, preparation of studies
and training programs will amount to about US$3.3 million in the aggregate. The
procurement arrangements and responsibilities, packaging of bids, as well as the contract
review requirements under the Project are described in detail in the PIP. The procurement
arrangements under the Project are shown below in Table 3.3.
F. Disbursements. Accounts and Audits
3.10        Disbursements. The Project is the first Bank operation in the human
resources sector in Bulgaria, and therefore, the country disbursement profile is speculative.
The Project has been designed within the capacity of MOH to execute over a five-year
period, and Loan funds are expected to be fully disbursed within five and one-half years of
Board Approval. The Closing Date will be December 31, 2001. The disbursement plan is
shown in Table 9 of the PIP.
3.11        Disbursements for goods under contracts below US$200,000 equivalent and
technical assistance and training contracts below US$50,000 equivalent would be made
against a certified Statement of Expenditures (SOE) for which appropriate documents would
be retained by the implementing agency. Disbursements for contracts above these limits
would be made on the basis of full documentation. The required supporting documentation
will be retained by the PMU for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit
report for the year in which the last disbursement was made. This documentation will be
made available for review by the auditors and by visiting Bank staff upon request.
3.12        Special Account. To facilitate project implementation, the Government will
establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special
Account for the Project. The Special Account will be denominated in US Dollars and

established in a bank acceptable to Bank. The authorized allocation for the Special Account
will be US$500,000. Upon receipt'of the Government request, the Bank will deposit into the
Special Account an initial amount of US$250,000. When the aggregate amount of
disbursements reaches US$2.0 million, the amount deposited in the Special Account will be
increased to the full authorized allocation of US$500,000.
3.13        Project Audits. Project Accounts and the Special Account will be audited in
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects
Financed by the World Bank" (March 1982). The Government will provide the Bank within
six months of the end of each fiscal year, an audit report of such scope and detail as the
Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an independent auditor
acceptable to the Bank, on disbursements against certified SOEs.
G. Project Reporting. Evaluation and Supervision
3.14        The PMU will prepare semi-annual progress reports (beginning from the date
of Loan Effectiveness) on each project component, objective and activity describing:
(a) current status and issues; (b) deviations, if any, from the implementation plan and project
targets; and (c) recommendations for actions and forward planning.
3.15        Mid-Term Review and Evaluation. By December 31, 1998, the PMIU will
undertake jointly with the Bank a mid-term review of progress in project implementation to
determine whether: (a) the Project's intended objectives remain valid; (b) implementation is
advancing satisfactorily to justify its continued implementation; and (c) any adjustments to,
or significant restructuring of, the Project are necessary to improve its effectiveness.
3.16        During negotiations. the Government provided assurances that a mid-term
iroEject review will be conducted in accordance with terms of reference (TORl agreed with
the Bank (no later than December 31, 1998) (para. 5.1).
3.17        Project Completion and Evaluation. Project implementation is expected to
be completed within five years by June 30, 2001. The PMU will be responsible for
preparing a Project Implementation Completion Report to be submitted to the Bank by June
30, 2002.
3.18        Bank Supervision. Because this is the first Bank-financed project in the
health sector in Bulgaria, the Project will require intensive supervision (25 staff weeks each
year) during the first two years of implementation. - The basis of Bank supervision will be the
semi-annual progress reports and the PIP. These will be supplemented by a review of
project expenditures and availability of financial resources, and discussions with technical

assistance groups implementing/assisting in the implementation of various components as well
as with senior management of MOH and the Government.
H. Status of Project Preparation
3.19        The status of preparation is as follows: (a) The PCC and the PMU have been
established; (b) coordination and implementation responsibilities of the PMU and MOH line
departments involved in project implementation have been defined; (c) TORs for the first
year technical assistance requirements have been prepared; (d) Standard Bidding Documents
for works, equipment and consultant services have been prepared with Bank assistance for
Bank-financed projects in Bulgaria, and will be modified by the PMU to suit the project's
requirements. Equipment lists and detailed technical specifications have been prepared for
most components; and (e) preliminary architectural designs for the Blood Transfusion
Centers have been completed, and bidding documents are being finalized.

IV. BENEFIT AND RISKS
Benefits
4.1          The project will have four major benefits. It will: (i) contribute to economic
growth and increased lifetime income for individuals through the impact of improved health
status on labor productivity, fewer work loss days, a longer working life, increased ability of
individuals to obtain better jobs, and (through the positive interaction of health and
education) increased enrollment and improved ability to learn; (ii) reduce poverty and
improve equity by targeting health interventions to the poor who stand to gain the most in
economic terms from improvements in health status; (iii) increase the efficiency of the health
system by focusing on health interventions (e.g. preventive and primary) that are known to
be the most cost effective, i.e., those that yield the greatest gains in disability adjusted life
years per unit cost (through a decrease in infant, maternal and other adult mortality, lower
levels of disability associated with various degrees of illness), and by improving the
institutional organization, service delivery, and input utilization of the health sector; and, (iv)
improve fiscal balance and promote macro-economic stability by containing cost escalation in
the health sector.
Risks
4.2         The most important risk faced by the project lies in the lack of experience and
weak managerial capabilities of MOH staff engaged in a major reform and restructuring
program. This risk will be offset by building on and expanding ongoing programs which are
being implemented successfully by other donors and by financing a supporting technical
assistance and training program. Other risks are linked to the country's exceptional
conditions. For instance, political uncertainties still inhibit the full commitment of some
officials to the reform program. Moreover, unrealistic expectations are often generated by a
misperception of Western systems or optimistic views on the time and resources required to
develop and introduce a specific reform. These risks will be somewhat mitigated by
financing information activities aimed at building a national consensus on health sector
reform and initiatives to break the isolation of MOH staff and develop professional contacts
with other Westem institutions.

HEALTH SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
1.         Introduction. This Project Implementation Plan (PIP) is based on findings of
the Bank appraisal mission of October 1994 and reflects the agreements with the Borrower
during negotiations in November 1995. The PIP summarizes the operational details for
implementing the Health Sector Restructuring Project and outlines: (a) the project content
and inputs; (b) project costs and financing plan; (c) implementation and coordination
responsibilities; (d) procurement arrangements; and (e) implementation, monitoring and
evaluation procedures and processes. The Project's operational details are described more
fully in the Project Operational Manual (POM) which is being finalized by the sector
institutions involved in the Project under the coordination of the Project Management Unit
(PMU) established in the Ministry of Health (MOH).
2.          Project Operational Manual. The POM constitutes the implementation
guidelines, performance and outcome monitoring tools for each of the four components of the
Project. Each of the four sections serves as a complete operational manual for a project
component, and includes detailed information and relevant documents developed at the
various stages of project preparation and at appraisal. Each section describes, among others,
(a) the relevant technical background, objectives, and scope of the component; (b) project
inputs (works, goods, services, operational and maintenance needs, etc.); (c) terms of
reference (TOR) for consulting services, studies and training programs; (d) implementation
schedules and charts; (e) implementation procedures (procurement, execution of tasks,
expenditure and accounting of resources used, reporting, etc); (f) formats for bidding and
contractual documents; (g) responsibilities of relevant implementing institutions and decision-
making matrices; (h) performance targets and monitoring indicators; and (i) detailed cost
estimates, periodic budgetary requirements, and financing arrangements. The outline of the
POM is shown in Appendix 1.
A. Project Objectives and Scope
3.          The Project aims to prevent further deterioration in the health status of the
population, while at the same time improving the efficiency of the health care delivery
system. The Project will: (i) facilitate the restructuring of the health sector by strengthening
the policy analysis and management capacity in the sector; and (ii) protect the population at
large--and vulnerable groups in particular--by ensuring continuing provision of essential
health services during the transition period and beyond. The Project consists of four



- 40 -                       Annex 1
Page 4 of 46
components: (a) Policy Analysis and Management; (b) Primary Health Care; (c) Emergency
Medical Services; and (d) Blood Transfusion. The scope of each project component is
described in detail in Chapter 2 of the main text of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) and
summarized briefly below. The Project will provide medical and laboratory equipment,
computer equipment and software, emergency medical and transport vehicles, technical
assistance, fellowships, training, rehabilitation of health facilities, and incremental recurrent
costs. Details of the elements/inputs financed by the Project for each component are outlined
in Appendix 2 (Detailed Cost Tables).
(a) Policy Analysis and Management. This component will assist the MOH in
strengthening its capacity for policy analysis and evaluation and will finance a limited
number of key studies such as a burden of disease analysis and cost-effectiveness
studies. The component will also finance computer software and hardware, as well as
basic office equipment to support the Economic Analysis Unit and the network of
Regional Health Centers, as they introduce new methodologies related to public
health sector restructuring and flexible budgeting, and monitor and evaluate the
implementation of health sector reforms. The component will also finance long-term
and short-term fellowships in the areas of health planning, management, economics
and finance, and health education and communications, as well as public information
activities.
(b) Primary Health Care. This component will improve the quality and scope of
primary health care in selected municipalities, which are committed to the
introduction of the reform of health services delivery and financing, and to
improvement of the efficiency of the health sector. The component will finance
minor rehabilitation equipment and furniture for up to 312 local health centers and
polyclinics. It will also finance consultant services to assist MOH and Municipal
Councils to plan PHC activities, design and implement the new package of PHC
services and training programs for medical doctors, nurses and other health and social
workers and well targeted municipal health promotion activities.
(c) Emergency Medical Services. This component will support ongoing efforts by
MOH to restructure emergency medical services and improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of service delivery. EMS functions will be separated from those of the
PHC network and a three-tiered national EMS network will be created. The
component will finance minor civil works for base stations at the periphery and minor
civil works and equipment for two types of emergency rooms (21 regional hospital
and 45 community hospital emergency rooms). In addition, it will finance 29
properly equipped intervention vehicles for the medical teams, and 96 ambulances for
the basic life support teams in the pre-hospital services. The component will also
finance consultant services to assist in completing the project concept, coordinating

implementation, and in managing the EMS and in training medical, paramedical and
administrative staff.
(d) Blood Transfusion. This component will assist current efforts to improve the
supply and quality of blood and blood products by restructuring and rehabilitating the
network of blood transfusion centers, introducing safer and more up to date
technology, and promoting the recruitment of new donors. The component will
finance minor civil works and equipment to renovate existing facilities of the National
Center for Clinical and Transfusion Hematology (NCCTH) and the five Regional
Transfusion Hematology Centers (RTHCs) in Sofia, Plovdiv, Pleven, Stara Zagora,
and Varna. It will also finance technical assistance to design programs and training
for health personnel engaged in donor recruitment, public relations, blood collection
and processing, and quality control.
B. Proiect Costs and Flnancing Plan
4.    -       Project Costs. The total project cost is estimated at about Bulgaria Leva
(BGL) 5.3 billion or US$47. 1 million equivalent, including contingencies, duties and taxem.
The total foreign exchange component amounts to about US$30.5 million, or around 71
percent of total project cost net of taxes and duties which amount to US$4.2 million
equivalent. The total local cost component (excluding taxes) amounts to about US$12.4
million equivalent. Total baseline costs are estimated at US$41.3 million, and total
contingencies at US$5.9 million equivalent. Table 1 shows the estimated cost by project
component. Project costs are also summarized by expenditure category (Table 2) and by
expenditure category and project component (Table 3). Detailed cost estimates of each
project component are shown in Appendi 2.

5.          Basis of Cost Estimates. Project costs have been updated to reflect prices at
the time of negotiations (November 1995), and are estimated as follows:
(a)   Base Costs. Base and unit cost estimates are net of taxes and duties, and are
derived from: (a) costs of consultant services, fellowships and training based
on rates currently charged by local, European and North American consultants
and training programs; (b) recent international bids for ambulances and
quotations obtained from suppliers of hospital/medical and office equipment;
(c) estimated requirements for reference and training materials; (d) current
market prices for furniture; (e) recent contracts for building and refurbishment
of health facilities and from consultants' surveys of the current construction
costs; (f) aggregated costs of local and foreign specialized services, internal
travel and subsistence, and mission estimates of material and logistic needs to
estimate the preparation of studies; (g) staff-unit costs from current public
service salary scales adjusted to a level deemed competitive with the market
for local specialized services; and (h) non-salary recurrent costs based on
current Government rates. All project costs are estimated in US Dollars at
November 1995 prices. Conversions of unit prices from the local currency are
based on the prevailing official exchange rate at the time of negotiations in
November 1995 of 68.7 BGL per US Dollar.
(b)   Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency for unforeseen
physical variations (US$3.4 million) equivalent to ten percent of the base cost
of all items except for vehicle costs for which five percent was applied and
none for incremental recurrent costs. Price contingencies on base costs and
physical contingencies are estimated at about US$2.5 million equivalent, or six
percent, and reflect Bank estimates of local and international price increases."
(c)   Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component is estimated
at about US$30.5 million including contingencies, or about 71 percent of total
project cost net of taxes and duties. Calculations of the foreign exchange
content is based on the following: (i) civil works and furniture for
rehabilitation of PHCs and EMS stations --15 percent; (ii) 40 percent for
rehabilitation of Transfusion Hematology Centers; (iii) 100 percent for foreign
fellowships and technical assistance, medical and office equipment, computer
hardware and software, books and journals, medical supplies, and vehicles;
' The following price escalation rates were applied in calculating price contingencies:
1995     1996     1997      1998     1999      20
Foreign Costs    3.3%     2.3%     2.5%    2.5%      2.5%      2.5%
Local Costs    62.7%     28.8%    20.0%     7.5%     3.2%      3.2%

(iv) 35 percent for local training; (iv) 25 percent for maintenance of vehicles
and equipment, and other non-salary operational costs; and (v) zero for local
specialist services, salaries of local staff, and building maintenance.
(d)   Customs Duties and Taxes. With the exception of technical assistance and
training contracts, works and goods required under the Project will not be
exempt from payment of customs duties and local taxes. MOH will ensure
that local resources for the payment of import duties and taxes on goods and
works to be purchased under the Project are available when needed. Project
costs include an estimated US$4.2 million equivalent in direct and indirect
taxes and duties to be financed by the Government.
(e)   Incremental Recurrent Costs. The project costs include BGL 280.1 million or
about US$4.0 million (base cost) to cover incremental operating costs directly
attributable to the Project during the five-year implementation period. These
consist mainly of incremental operation and maintenance expenditure for
emergency vehicles and hematology equipment. There are no significant
incremental costs for staff salaries expected other than support staff for project
management. Averaged over five years, the yearly requirement represents less
than one percent of the 1994 total Government budget for the health sector of
BGL 22.5 billion, and is deemed sustainable. Measures now being instituted
in the health sector to reduce recurrent costs, improve efficiency and increase
collection of user charges will place the incremental recurrent cost within
sustainable limits. During implementation, MOH will pay particular attention
to monitoring the adequacy of recurrent funds for maintenance and operation
of facilities and newly instituted programs, and take the necessary actions to
rectify any deficiencies.
6.          Fnancing Plan. The Project will be financed by a Bank Loan of US$26.0
million, a Grant from EU PHARE of US$2.3 million equivalent, a Loan from the Council of
Europe Social Development Fund (CEF) of US$11.0 million equivalent, and counterpart
funds from the Bulgarian Government equivalent to US$7.8 million. The Bank Loan of
US$26.0 million will finance 85 percent of the direct and indirect foreign exchange. Total
Bank financing will represent about 61 percent of total project cost net of taxes. The
Government selected a currency pool loan for this Project (rationale being requested from
Government). The Government has already obtained the EU PHARE Grant, and intends to
sign a separate loan agreement with CEF for the CEF Loan. All duties and taxes under the
Project will be financed by the Government. A Japan Grant of US$500,000 equivalent was
made available to contract critical specialist services and procure equipment necessary for
project preparation. Details of the financing plan are shown in Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6
below.

7.          Disbursements. The proposed Bank Loan is expected to be disbursed over a
five and a half year period. The Closing Date will be on December 31, 2001.
8.          Disbursements against eligible expenditure will be made at the following rates:
(a)   Office and medical equipment and materials, and vehicles -- 100 percent of
foreign expenditures; 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory cost); and
80 percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally; and;
(b)   100 percent of expenditures for consultant services, fellowships and study
visits.
9.          Special Account. To facilitate project implementation and the timely flow of
funds to the implementing institutions, the Government will establish, maintain and operate,
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account for the Project. The
Special Account will be denominated in US Dollars and established in a bank acceptable to
Bank. The authorized allocation for the Special Account will be US$500,000, which amount
is judged adequate to cover an average four months of eligible expenditure under the Project.
Payments of eligible expenditure (goods, specialist services, fellowships and study tours) may
be made by the PMU out of the Special Account. Upon receipt of the Government request,
Bank will deposit into the Special Account an initial amount of US$250,000. When the
aggregate amount of disbursements reaches US$2.0 million, the amount deposited in the
Special Account will be increased to the full authorized allocation of US$500,000. The
Special Account will be replenished on a monthly basis or when the undisbursed balance falls
below an amount equal to 50 percent or less of the initial deposit. In addition to
documentation requirement stated in para. 10, monthly bank statements of the Special
Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower will accompany all replenishment
requests.
10.        All withdrawal applications will be fully documented except that contracts for
goods under US$200,000 equivalent and contracts for technical assistance, studies,
fellowships and training under US$50,000 will be supported by Statements of Expenditure
(SOE) certified by the PMU Project Director. The required supporting documentation will
be retained by the PMU for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for
the year in which the last disbursement was made. This documentation will be made
available for review by the auditors and by visiting Bank staff upon request. The processing,
disbursement and monitoring of the allocations of the proceeds of the Bank Loan and
Government counterpart financing will be managed by the PMU in coordination and
consultation with the Ministry of Fir.ance (MOF). The financing plan by disbursement
category is shown below in Table 7. Estimates of semestral disbursements of the Bank Loan
are shown in Table 8.

11.                Project Audits. Project Accounts and the Special Account will be audited in
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects
Financed by the World Bank" (March 1982). The Government will provide the Bank within
six months of the end of each fiscal year, an audit report of such scope and detail as the
Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an independent auditor
acceptable to the Bank, on disbursements against certified Statements of Expenditure (SOE).
The separate opinion should mention whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year,

Page 12 of 46
together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied
upon to support the related withdrawal applications. TORs for such audits have been
prepared and will be included in the POM.
C. Implementation and Coordination Arrangements
12.         Overview. The Borrower is the Republic of Bulgaria which is represented by
the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The Ministry of Health (MOH) will have overall
responsibility for the Project. The design of the Project has been carefully tailored to the
implementation and absorptive capacity of the MOH. The project management and
implementing agencies will be supported with appropriate technical assistance to strengthen
their implementation capacity. The Project will be implemented by MOH line departments,
and municipalities. The day-to-day coordination of all Project-related activities will be the
responsibility of the Project Management Unit (PMU) in the MOH. A Project Coordination
Committee (PCC) has been established2' within MOH to oversee project implementation,
provide guidance and advice to the PMU, and ensure that project objectives remain consistent
with national health policy and priorities. Chaired by the Minister of Health, the PCC
includes: (i) heads of the PMU and MOH Departments involved in the Project; (ii) heads of
sector institutions directly involved in project implementation such as the National Center of
Health Informatics (NCHI), the National Center of Clinical and Transfusion Hematology
(NCCTH); and (iii) representatives of MOF.
13.         Project Coordination and Management. The PMU will have overall
responsibility for coordinating project implementation, managing project funds, monitoring
implementation progress, and liaison between MOH institutional units and with external
agencies including the Bank. To be effective, the PMU will be maintained as a compact,
well equipped unit, and provided with direct access to decision making authority in the MOH
and other agencies involved in the Project. The PMU has been established and is headed by
a full-time Project Manager -- a senior MOH official of sufficient authority and experience --
under the authority of the General Director for Health Policy and International Cooperation.
The PMU full-time staff include: (a) Deputy Project Manager responsible for coordinating
the Project's technical assistance program; (b) a Project Accountant; (c) a Project
Procurement Officer; (d) a bilingual Secretary responsible for project files/records, and
adequate support staff (e.g. accounting assistant, clerical personnel, etc.) as needed. To
facilitate daily operations and ensure proper collaboration with MOH staff and implementing
units, the PMU will be located in the MOH and be provided with suitable accommodations,
office technology, communications and transport facilities.
v' The PCC was established on July 11, 1994, by a circular decree issued by the Minister of Health.



- 49 -                      Annex I
Page 13 of 46
14.        The PMU will have three principal sets of responsibilities: (a) coordination
and monitoring of all Project-related implementation activities; (b) procurement of technical
assistance (TA) and equipment, as well as monitoring compliance of other procurement with
procedures agreed with the Bank; and (c) management of project funds. The PMU will call
the attention of MOH management, and/or the Bank and other financiers as appropriate, any
implementation problems or issues which may arise that require immediate action.
Specifically, the PMU will be responsible for the following:
(a)   Project Coordination and Monitoring. PMU will be the principal liaison with
institutions outside the MOH, including the Bank, EU PHARE and CEF, for
project administration and supervision purposes. It will ensure that all
resources utilized under the Project (financial, physical, staff, etc.) are in
accordance with the Project's priorities and objectives. To this end, PMU will
(i) maintain up-to-date, detailed implementation schedules of each project
component; (ii) monitor compliance by the implementing institutions with
Project/Loan covenants and with agreed performance indicators; and
(iii) monitor the placement and performance of staff undertaking external
training, and of consultants contracted under the Project. PMU will prepare
and distribute, by the specified dates to relevant agencies: consolidated semi-
annual implementation progress reports; and annual financial audit reports.
(b)   Procurement. The PMU will be responsible for all procurement under the
project. PMU will undertake the procurement of all equipment, technical
assistance and services contracts, and overseas training contracts, in
collaboration with the relevant implementing departments/units as described
further below. The PMU will be responsible for reviewing procurement
action and compliance by implementing institutions with procedures and
documentation agreed with the Bank. The PMU will ensure that the Standard
Bidding Documents (SBD) prepared by the Bank for Bank-financed operations
in Bulgaria, are appropriately modified to suit the project requirements, and
used consistently for procurement under the Project. The PMU will be
involved in the conduct of the bids and bid evaluation, clear all procurement
documentation and follow up contract approval processes (obtaining the Bank's
prior approval where required) to ensure that all goods, works and services are
contracted in accordance with the procedures and documentation agreed with
the Bank. Specifically, the conduct and supervision of procurement activities
will be undertaken as follows:
(i)   Procurement of Works. Under the general supervision of PMU, the
MOH Department of Construction (MOH-DCON) will monitor and
supervise the rehabilitation and upgrading of health facilities (PHC
centers, EMS stations, and RTHCs) under the Project. MOH-DCON



-50-                         Annex 1
Page 14 of 46
will, inter alia, (1) ensure that the agreed building planning/design
norms are complied with in upgrading project facilities; (2) supervise
the work of consultant architects/engineers in the preparation of
construction plans and documents; (3) conduct the bidding process; and
(4) and oversee the progress of civil works and the performance of
building contractors.
(ii)   Procurement of Goods. The PMU will be responsible for the conduct
of all equipment and goods procurement under the Project. As needed,
in carrying out its procurement tasks, the PMU will involve the staff of
the MOH Economic and Finance Department (MOH-DEQ) as well as
the MOH departments responsible for implementing the respective
project components. PMU will, inter alia, (1) adapt the SBDs for the
procurement of goods prepared by the Bank for appropriate Project use;
(2) conduct the equipment bidding process including preparation of
specific bidding documents, issuance, reception and evaluation of bids
received; and (3) monitor the performance of equipment delivery and
installation contracts and of equipment suppliers.
(iii) Procurement of Technical Assistance (TA). PMU will have overall
responsibility for the procurement of consultant services and
fellowships contracts. In collaboration with the relevant MOH
technical unit, PMU will issue invitations to consulting firms, prepare
shortlists, preside over the evaluation of TA proposals, award
contracts, and monitor the contractual performance of specialists.
(c)   Management of Project Funds. The PMU will take measures to facilitate the
flow of resources to MOH agencies to enable successful implementation of
their Project-related tasks. PMU will administer the Special Account
established for the Project, process disbursement applications, and monitor the
use of Loan funds. It will maintain up-to-date accounts and records (contracts,
purchase orders, guarantees, etc.) of all Project-related expenditure
(investment and recurrent, Loan and Grant resources from the Bank, EU
PHARE and CEF, and Government counterpart funds), and keep updated
estimates of the total costs expected to be needed to complete the Project. The
PMU will monitor and take appropriate steps to obtain adequate Government
counterpart funds to finance the planned project activities. In this connection,
it will consolidate the estimates, prepared by each implementing Department or
unit, of the financial and other resource needs of their respective components
for each implementation year. These consolidated budgetary estimates will be
reviewed with the Bank during the annual project performance reviews for
adequacy, but in any event, sufficiently in advance of the Government's annual



- 51 -                       Annex 1
Page 15 of 46
budgetary presentation/approval processes to accommodate appropriate
changes.
15.         Project Implementation. Primary responsibility for the execution of the
project components rests with the respective MOH Departments and sectoral institutions
involved. These units will coordinate closely with PMU in carrying out their functions under
the Project. The main responsibilities of the implementing units are as follows:
(a)   Policy Analysis and Management Component. Overal responsibility for
implementation of this component will rest with the Deputy Minister for
Health Care Financing in the MOH. The existing Economic Analysis Unit
(EAU) in MOH will be strengthened with additional staff, training and
technical assistance and will assist MOH in analyzing policy options and
organizing and disseminating information on health sector reform. The EAU
will also coordinate certain activities carried out by various health institutes.
In particular, implementation of the regional health care restructuring exercise
and flexible budgeting activities will be the responsibility of technical teams
from different institutions, including the National Center for Health
Information (NCHI), National Insurance Research and Development Center
and the National Institute of Public Health.
(b)   Primary Health Care Component.  This component will be implemented by
the municipalities under the guidance and supervision of the MOH Department
for Health Services (DHS), in particular by the Division of Primary Health
Care (DPHC). In early 1995, with financial assistance from the Japan Grant
and foreign and national technical assistance, the DHS will organize a
workshop to prepare the Guidelines for implementing primary health care in
participating municipalities. Technical assistance wiU be provided by the
DPHC to participating municipalities, for the design of three-year Municipal
Plans of Action. Workshops will prepare the curriculum for the training
program in PHC, including health promotion for physicians and nurses. The
DPHC will ensure the supply of equipment and consumables to Primary
Health Care centers and small polyclinics. The overall management and
coordination of the program will be ensured through regular meetings in the
Districts and reviewed during the mid-term evaluation.
(c)   Emergency Medical Services Component. This component wiU be
implemented and coordinated at the national level by the Emergency Medical
Services (EMS) unit within the DHS. EMS has the main responsibility for
preparing the necessary regulations and instructions for the introduction of the
new system, as well as for making the arrangements and negotiating with
municipalities on the transfer of facilities and staff. The unit is staffed with



-52 -                        Annex 1
Page 16 of 46
two EMS experts and is assisted by the working group, which has been
involved in the preparation of the component, and which includes
representatives of the district EMS network thus providing the necessary local
participation in the reform process. The EMS unit will use local expert
assistance for the finalization of the EMS reform program and the launching of
implementation at the regional level. The unit will also be responsible for the
organization and carrying out of the training programs planned under the
component. The PMU will collaborate with the Project Management Unit of
the EU PHARE-financed Project as necessary for the oversight of this
component.
(d)   Blood Transfusion Component. This component will be implemented by the
National Center for Clinical and Transfusion Hematology (NCCTH) under the
MOH. The NCCTH is the main institution responsible for designing and
implementing national policies in the field of clinical and transfusion
hematology. It is also responsible for coordinating all services provided by the
network of blood transfusion centers and providing technical assistance as
required. The NCCTH performs research in clinical and transfusion
hematology, develops standardization and quality control documents, and is
engaged in the quality control of blood banks.The NCCTH will supervise the
implementation of the activities in the five Regional Transfusion Hematology
Centers (RTHC) included in the Project. These institutions are the main
regional centers for blood collection and blood processing. They perform
immunohematologic tests and tests for transmissive agents (HIV, hepatitis B
and C and syphilis). They monitor the validity and reliability of testing done
in other centers. The NCCTH and the five RTHCs will also be involved in
the blood donor recruitment program. They will work very closely with the
National Center for Health Promotion (NCHP).
16.         Each MOH Technical Department will ensure that their respective project
activities are carried out in accordance with agreed project objectives and performance
targets. Each implementing agency will establish a mechanism with the PMU to ensure the
timely flow of resources for implementing its programs. Typically, each implementing unit
or department will be responsible for the following activities:
(a)   in collaboration with the PMU: (i) finalizing the terms of reference (TOR) for
the specialist services, feasibility studies, and training (in-country and abroad)
required in their respective parts of the Project; and (ii) evaluating proposals
received for consulting services;



- 53 -                       Annex 1
Page 17 of 46
(b)   monitoring the implementation of local training and seminars; and identifying
and tapping local expertise to assist in activities such as preparation of detailed
procedures and updated detailed implementation schedules;
(c)   in collaboration with PMU and DEQ: (i) finalizing the lists and detailed
specifications of equipment required in their respective components; and
(ii) valuating the equipment bids received for compliance with the technical
specifications and meeting the requirements of the end-user;
(d)   in collaboration with PMU and DCON, ascertaining that the upgrading of
facilities related to their respective components meet the technical requirements
of the end-user;
(e)   preparing periodic reports on the implementation progress of their respective
components, and submitting these to the PMU for inclusion in the semi-annual
report on project performance; and
(f)   preparing physical and financial forecasts of future actions required to
implement their parts of the Project, and forwarding these estimates to the
PMU for inclusion in the budgetary proposals for the succeeding
implementation year.
17.         Inter-Agency Coordination. Successful project implementation will depend
on close coordination among donor agencies -- EU PHARE, CEF, and the Bank, and the
effectiveness of PMU in bringing about this collaboration at project level. MOH and the
donors have agreed that: (a) technical data/information and progress reports on the Project
will be shared widely and openly; and (b) issues or potential problem areas will be brought
to the early attention of relevant authorities and the donors for appropriate response/action.
On-going programs initiated by WHO, as well as EU PHARE will be closely monitored to
identify areas where project activities could benefit from lessons learned.
D. Procurement Arrangements
18.         Procurement activities under the Project will be implemented as described
above in paras 15-17 under the overall supervision of PMU. Procurement will be
undertaken in accordance with procedures described in the Bank "Guidelines for Procurement
Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (January 1995) which govern the procurement of goods
contracts, with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the
World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1991) which govern the procurement of technical
assistance contracts, and with the documentation and procedures agreed with the Bank as



- 54 -                       Annex 1
Page 18 of 46
appropriate and as explained further in the succeeding paragraphs. To the extent feasible,
bids for goods and services should be grouped into homogenous packages for greater
efficiency and more effective management of contracts, and in the case of goods for economy
of scale. SBDs for goods and services which have been developed by the Bank will be
adapted by PMU for use under the Project. The procurement arrangements under the
Project are summarized in Table 9 below. The following procurement methodologies are
expected to be used under the Project. The Project Procurement Plan is shown in Appgendix
4 to this PIP.
19.         Procurement of Goods. Contracts for the procurement of goods (equipment,
vehicles, materials and supplies will be conducted as follows:
(a)   International Competitive Bidding (aCB). Vehicle and goods contracts which
are estimated to cost more than US$200,000 equivalent per contract will be
procured following international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in
accordance with the January 1992 Bank Guidelines for Procurement Under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (Procurement Guidelines). Standard Bidding
Documents (SBD) for goods which have recently been developed by the Bank
for Bulgaria will be adapted by the PMU for use under the Project. Medical,
laboratory and office equipment (about US$11.1 million tendered in 8 major
packages) will be packaged according to related specialized fields. Vehicles (3
packages) totalling US$5.2 million equivalent will be also be procured
following ICB procedures. Equipment and vehicles procured through ICB will
account for about 62 percent of the total value of equipment and goods
requirements. The remaining 38 percent of the value of goods and equipment
will be grouped in packages suitable for procurement using other than ICB
procedures. In the comparison of bids for equipment to be procured through
ICB, domestic manufacturers will be allowed a preferential margin of 15
percent, or the existing customs duty, whichever is lower, over the cost,
insurance and freight (CIF) prices of competing imports, in accordance with
Paras. 1 through 5 of Appendix 2 of the Bank Procurement Guidelines.
(b)   The exceptions to ICB procurement will be as follows:
(i)   International Shopping (IS?. Procedures for IS will be used for small
amounts of equipment where the cost of ICB will clearly outweigh
possible price advantages. Contracts for equipment estimated to cost
less than US$200,000 per contract, not to exceed an aggregate amount
of US$2.5 million equivalent, will be awarded under IS procedures,
based on comparing price quotations obtained from at least three
suppliers from two eligible source countries in accordance with Bank
Procurement Guidelines.

(ii)   National Shopping (NS. Minor sundry items, medical supplies and
materials not exceeding US$10,000 per contract, up to an aggregate
amount of US$50,000 equivalent, could be purchased on the basis of
prudent national shopping by comparing price quotations obtained from
at least three independent local suppliers, in accordance with
procedures acceptable to the Bank.
(iii)   Direct Procurement. Goods and technical licenses which the Bank
agrees: (i) are of proprietary nature; (ii) the timely supply thereof is
critical for efficient project execution; or (iii) need to be compatible
with other installed equipment, may be procured through direct
negotiations with property and/or copyright owners, on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank. Such items include contracts for
intellectual property such as books, technical journals,training

materials, audio-visual materials, computer applications software,
including annual upgrading and licensing arrangements, copyrights,
translation and reprinting rights for training materials, estimated to cost
about US$300,000 in the aggregate.
(iv)  Procurement from UNICEF. Based on existing relations between
UNICEF and MOH, there will be direct procurement from UNICEF of
medical equipment and materials for Primary Health Care centers
(aggregate US$6.0 million). The type of medical equipment and
materials required for PHC centers and polyclinics are normally found
in UNICEF warehouses. In case some of these medical equipment and
supplies for the PHCs are unavailable in UNICEF warehouses,
UNICEF may procure these goods for MOH in accordance with the
Bank's procurement procedures.
20.         Procurement of Technical Assistance. The technical assistance requirements
of the Project include consulting services, fellowships and study visits by selected Bulgarian
trainees in training institutions abroad, and in-country training for sector staff. The summary
of the Project's technical assistance and training needs is shown Appendix 5 - Technical
Assistance Schedule. Technical assistance contracts will be procured in the following
manner:
(a)   Consulting Services. Qualified firms will be invited to submit proposals for
comprehensive packages of consultant services, management of fellowships
and training, preparation of pre-investment and development studies, and
architectural/engineering services, in accordance with the August 1991
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The
World Bank as Executing Agency (Consultant Guidelines). To keep the
evaluation process manageable, no more than six (but at least three) proposals
will be invited following a short listing acceptable to the Bank. The total
aggregate value of consultants contracts is estimated at US$1.0 million
equivalent, of which, about 60 percent will be awarded to consulting firms (4
packages) and the rest, which are short-term specialized services (19 contracts
between US$25,000-US$40,000), to individual consultants selected on a
competitive basis. All consulting services will be procured in keeping with the
terms of reference described in the POM. Implementing units will be
provided with adequate technical support by the PMU to manage the selection
process.
(b)   Fellowships and Training. To the extent feasible, the management of
fellowships and training programs will be included in the procurement of
consulting contracts, and will be awarded in accordance with the Bank's



- 57 -                       Anne1
Page 21 of 46
Consultant Guidelines. The aggregate values of fellowships and training
programs is estimated at US$2.3 million equivalent. In most cases, overseas
training will be arranged directly with a selected training institution following
agreement with the Bank on the program and duration of training, the choice
of training institution, the candidates for fellowships, cost of the program and
arrangements for the re-entry of the fellowship candidate after completing
training.
21.         Non-Bank Financed Procurement. CEF and EU PHARE will finance some
elements/components of the Project. Procurement under these parts of the Project will be in
accordance with procedures agreed between the Government and these donor agencies. In
particular: (a) all contracts for (i) civil works (aggregate US$11.9 million equivalent) for the
rehabilitation and upgrading of health facilities; and (ii) furniture (aggregate US$1.1 million)
for project institutions, which are financed by CEF, will be awarded in accordance with
procurement procedures agreed between the Council of Europe and the Government;
(b) procurement of goods, consultant services, and training contracts under the Policy
Analysis subcomponent of Component 1, which are financed by EU PHARE, will be
undertaken in accordance with procedures agreed between EU PHARE and the Government;
and (c) items of incremental recurrent salary and non-salary expenditure (aggregate US$2.6
million) will be financed entirely by the Government and contracted in accordance with
regular Government procedures.
22.         Review of Procurement Decisions. In compliance with Bank procedures,
SBDs will be used for all ICB procurement. The Bank will review master lists and technical
specifications of equipment, packaging of bids and updated cost estimates, bidding documents
(including invitations for bids, instructions to bidders, bid evaluation criteria, bid proposal
documents, general and special conditions of contract, and draft contract agreement). For
technical assistance contracts, the Bank will review TORs, invitations for proposals,
evaluation criteria, and draft contracts. It is estimated that this prior review will cover
about 75 percent of the value of all contracts combined for equipment and technical
assistance. The remaining 25 percent of contracts will be subject to selective post award
reviews by the Bank during the supervision of the Project. In accordance with procedures
described in Appendix 1 of the Bank Procurement Guidelines, the Bank will conduct a prior
review of the following contracts:
(a)   all contracts awarded through ICB;
(b)   all goods contracts procured through UNICEF;
(c)   for each project component: (i) the first two goods contracts awarded through
international shopping; and (ii) all contracts awarded through direct
procurement.



- 58 -                       Annex I
Page 22 of 46
(d)   technical assistance: (i) contracts above US$50,000 equivalent--all
procurement documentation (budgets, TORs, selection procedures, short lists,
letters of invitation, evaluation report, draft contracts); (ii) single-source
consultant contracts and assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably
determined by Bank-- all procurement documentation (see above);
(iii) contracts below US$50,000 equivalent--TORs; and (iv) amendments to the
employment of consultants raising the contract value to more than US$50,000-
-TORs; and,
(d) fellowships and training: TORs for external fellowships and study visits.
E. Implementation. Monitoring and Evaluation
23.         Project Implementation Calendar. The Project is expected to be completed
within a five-year implementation period beginning early 1996. The Project Completion
Date is June 30, 2001. Project preparation activities have been in progress since 1993, such
that at the time of negotiations in November 1995, project preparation activities are well
advanced -- the TORs for major technical assistance assignments have been drafted, vehicle
and equipment lists for project institutions as well draft technical specifications and bidding
documents have been completed, building and design norms for the health facilities as well as
preliminary architectural designs for Transfusion Hematology Centers have been completed
and reviewed by the Bank. In order to ensure that the Project starts procurement activities
by June 1996, the MOH/PMU will ensure that the Project Operational Manual has been
finalized, incorporating the Bank's suggestions. Furthermore, MOH will ensure that the
following actions have been taken:
(a)   finalize bidding documents for the procurement of goods and services, and bid
packages for goods to be procured during the first year of project
implementation;
(b)   finalize architectural/engineering plans and bidding documents for refurbishing
the RTHCs;
(c)   finalize TORs for the specialist services and training to be conducted during
the first year of the Project; and
(d)   complete the engineering survey of EMS and PHC facilities to be rehabilitated
during the first year.



- 59 -                        Annex 1
Page 23 of 46
24.         Appendix 2 (detailed costs of each project component) also indicates the
schedule of project inputs by year of project implementation, and will be translated into a
detailed implementation schedule in the form of a bar charts outlining the sequence of critical
steps taken to complete each activity. The implementation bar chart will form an integral
part of the POM for each component. Models of the implementation bar chart for each type
of project activity (for the procurement of works, goods and consulting services contracts)
are shown in Appendix 6 of this PIP.
25.         Reporting and Annual Reviews. The PMU will prepare semi-annual
descriptive and financial reports on each project component, objective and activity, beginning
from the date of Loan Effectiveness. The reports will describe: (a) current status;
(b) deviations, if any, from the implementation plan; and (c) the reasons for deviations and
corrective actions being taken. Sample progress-reporting documents will be included in the
POM. Reporting and Bank supervision will focus on in-depth reviews of the policy
framework for sectoral improvements, the consistency of activities for each component and
subcomponent with agreements reached at negotiations, performance of the implementing
groups and institutions, assessment of emerging needs for adjustments to project parameters,
and possible follow-up operations which could be supported by the Bank. Bank supervision
will be based on the semi-annual progress reports and the annual evaluation of project
activities by the MOH. This will be supplemented by a review of project expenditures and
availability of financial resources, in addition to substantive discussions with technical
assistance groups implementing and/or assisting in the implementation of various
components, and discussions with responsible authorities. The PIP will be the basis for
supervision and reporting.
26.         Mid-Term Review and Evaluation. By December 31, 1998 (or about two
and one-half years after Loan Effectiveness), the PMU will undertake jointly with the Bank a
mid-term review of progress in project implementation to determine whether: (a) the
Project's intended objectives remain valid; (b) implementation is advancing satisfactorily to
justify its continued implementation; and (c) any adjustments to, or significant restructuring
of the Project are necessary to improve its effectiveness. The POM will be updated
following the mid-term review and the annual work program for the following years will
reflect the recommendations made. The PMU will prepare draft TORs for the mid-term
review and present these for the Bank's comments by the end of September 1998.
27.         Role of the World Bank During Supervision. Because this is the first
Project in the health sector in Bulgaria, the Project will, on average, require about 25 staff-
weeks of intensive Bank supervision per year during the first two years of implementation to
launch the many of the new Project-related activities. These include the training of primary
health care workers, introduction of management reforms and computerized management
support systems in hospitals. Whenever possible, Bank staff will supervise the human

Page 24 of 46
resources projects in the same missions, thereby realizing economies of scale in utilization of
Bank staff resources. This is reflected in the proposed supervision plan in Table 10 below:

- Task manager (8 wks)
- Implementation/Operations specialist (7 wks)
FY2001         15 weeks     Bank resources (15 wks) of which:
- Task mannaer (8 wks)
- Implementation/Operations specialist (7 wks)
28.           Monitoring Development Objectives. Tracking key monitoring indicators is
necessary to measure the impact of the project inputs on the key development objectives.
These indicators have been agreed upon and will be monitored throughout the project cycle.
At the mid-term review, the need to fine-tune or restructure the project design will be based
on the analysis of these indicators. In order to assess the impact of a given intervention on
development objectives, four sets of indicators will be used to monitor and evaluate progress
during project implementation: input indicators, output indicators, outcome indicators, and
financial indicators. Input/Outpbt Tables will be prepared for each subcomponent of the
1i Supplementary technical inputs will be requested through bilateral/multilateral cooperation in the
following areas: public health economics, health planning, management development, public health
education, and health information systems.

Project and included in the POM. These tables will be used to monitor the progress in
project implementation.
(a)   Input Indicators. These indicators will track planned investments in terms of
contracting technical assistance (staff-months), enrollment and time (staff-
months) in training programs and procurement of goods and civil works
(disbursements). These indicators are represented in standard input tables for
each major subcomponent of the Project as shown in Appendix 2.
(b)   Output Indicators. These indicators will track items such as: (i) the number
of studies or reports that have been completed by a given date during the
project cycle; (ii) the number of training programs held and students trained:
(iii) the equipment or vehicles that have been procured; and (iv) the number of
equipped facilities that have been constructed or renovated. These indicators
will be tracked in standard Output Tables for each major subcomponent of the
Project.
(c)   Outcome Indicators. These indicators will track whether or not the
development objectives of the Project have been met. Two criteria were used
to select the basic outcome indicators for health status: (i) that the indicator is
known to be sensitive to the intervention introduced under the Project; and
(ii) that data is readily available through routine collection.
(d)   Financial Indicators. The POM will include detailed financial requirements
based on the timing of major procurement packages. The PMU will be
responsible for monitoring and reviewing the financial plan for the Project to
ensure that there will be sufficient lead time to submit realistic annual budget
requirements to the MOF. The PMU will also monitor the effect of the
Project on incremental and recurrent costs of the health sector. The
introduction of modern management systems to hospital operations is expected
to improve the efficiency and reduce overall unit costs.
29.         For each of the four components, process and outcome indicators have been
agreed upon. These outcome and intermediate process indicators will be tracked during the
Project through routine data collection and simple survey sampling techniques. During the
mid-term review, these indicators will be analyzed and possible corrections of the project
implementation procedures will be effected. Throughout the Project, the PMU wil be
responsible for: (a) tracking the above indicators; (b) tracking inputs and outputs as they
relate to the project development activities; and (c) overseeing proposed studies and other
pre-investment studies. This committee will be headed by an applied operations research
specialist and will report directly to the PMU Director.

30.         Process Indicators. The following intermediate indicators have been agreed
upon:
(a)   Policy Analysis and Management:
(i)   the Economic Analysis Unit is operating;
(ii)   various studies and pilot activities are under implementation;
(b)   Primary Health Care:
(i)   number of municipalities with an active PHC program;
(ii)  immunization rates;
(iii)  ratio of abortion to live birth;
(iv)  availability of contraceptives;
(c)   Emergency Medical Services:
(i)   EMS no longer ensures home visits;
(ii)  Introduction of new software makes available reliable data for EMS
activities;
(d)   Blood Transfusion:
(i)   percentage replacement of glass containers by plastic pouch;
(ii)   100% testing for Hepatitis B and HIV of the blood supply;
31.         Outcome Indicators. The following outcome indicators have been proposed
for each component. Specific targets are being developed and will be part of the Operational
Manual.
(a)   Policy Analysis and Management:
(i)   implementation of the new budget system
(ii)   downsizing of hospital bed capacity and staff
(iii)  improved efficiency of health services.
(b)   Primary Health Care:
(i)   improve infant mortality;
(ii)  improve maternal mortality;
(iii)  decrease 20-64 adult mortality; and,
(iv)   decrease in hospital referrals.

HEALTH SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
OUTLINE OF PROJECT OPERATIONAL MANUAL
Introduction
1.          This Project Operational Manual (POM) has been prepared by the Project
Management Unit (PMU) jointly with each implementing unit/department. The POM
constitutes implementation guidelines, and project performance and outcome monitoring tool
for each project component. The POM comprises four volumes, each of which elaborate the
implementation procedures applicable to each Project component, as well as information
from relevant documents developed at the various stages of project preparation and at
appraisal.
2.          Project Objectives and Scope. The Health Sector Restructuring Project aims
to prevent further deterioration in the health status of the population, while at the same time
improving the efficiency of the health care delivery system. The project would: (i) facilitate
the restructuring of the health sector by strengthening the policy analysis and management
capacity in the sector; (ii) protect the population at large--and vulnerable groups in particular-
-by ensuring continuing provision of essential health services during the transition period and
beyond; and (iii) monitor the health status of the population and strengthen health promotion
activities. The Project consists of four components: (a) Policy Analysis and Management;
(b) Primary Health Care; (c) Emergency Medical Services; and (d) Blood Transfusion. The

BULGARIA
HEALTH SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
THE HEALTH OF THE BULGARIAN POPULATION
I. COUNTRY BACKGROUND
1.          Since the 1950s, the health of the Bulgarian population has substantially
improved as shown by trends in most of the broad health indicators (Table 1). This
improvement, however, has lagged since 1985 and appears to be reversing itself in the last 4-
5 years. Progressive aging of the population contributes to this situation and raises problems
of constantly increasing social and medical costs, a phenomenon common to all European
countries. Specific death rates by age show a significant increase among persons aged 40 to
59 over the last 30 years. This increase is essentially due to the excess mortality among
males in this age group. Hence, the health of the middle-aged adult is a challenge to the
Bulgarian health system.
2.          The Bulgarian Health System has major assets, in particular excellent access
to health care provided "free of charge" to the population through an extensive network of
health centers, polyclinics, hospitals and institutes. The system, however, is rather
inefficient, as discussed in Annex 3, because of its duplication, overstaffing, inadequate
management and poorly allocated recurrent budget. Consequently, the system places a heavy
fiscal burden on a country where government revenues have contracted by 50 percent in real
terms since 1989. Despite this contraction, the Government maintained health expenditure in
real terms until 1993. However, the inevitable adjustment of public health expenditure to the
fiscal crisis, combined with the fast pace of decentralization of the health care delivery
system and the unregulated emergence of private health care providers is leading to further
deterioration in the quality of health care.
3.          Over the past three years the Government has taken a number of painful but
necessary steps to improve the balance between available resources and expenditures: limits
on medical school enrolment, restructuring of the Medical Academy and of the medical
schools, closure of excess sanatoria beds (around 3,400), privatization of the drug
distribution system, and setting new norms for medical services. The Ministry of Health and
the medical community are now wrestling with the most complex and often controversial
issues such as the financing of health services, the allocation of resources in a decentalized
setting and the types of incentives to improve both greater efficiency and quality of health
services.

Page 3 of 19
4.          Stagnation or deterioration in health indicators appears to be due, inter alia, to
the lack of investment in the sector because of a declining economic situation, and to the
inefficient utilization of the recurrent budget. Consequently, this led to a deep deterioration
of the health system, in particular the primary health care (PHC) system, which could not
fulfill its "triage" role. The lack of effectiveness of PHC has put additional stress on an
already overwhelmed emergency and hospital system.
II. POPULATION
5.          According to the 1992 census, the population of Bulgaria was 8.484.900, with
sixty seven percent of the population living in urban areas. The distribution of the population
by Region and by urban/rural residence is presented in Table 2 and the structure by age and
sex is presented in Table 3. It is worth noting that the rural population is older, and the
proportion of working age group (ages 15 to 59) is less than in urban areas. The broad
trends in population dynamics indicate:
(a)   a progressive aging of the population over the past 35 years (from 13% over
60 years of age in 1965 to 20% in 1992);
(b)   a rapid urbanization of the population between 1946 and 1980 (urban
population of 25% in 1946 and 62.5% in 1980), with a slow down in recent
years (67% in 1992);
(c)   very little improvement of life expectancy at birth over the past 35 years
(from 69.59 in 1960 to 71.21 in 1993) except for women (71.35 in 1960 to
74.66 in 1991); and
(d)   as in other European countries, a low rate of population growth since the
1970s and even a negative growth rate since 1990. This last trend is related
to a decrease in natality (lower fertility rate and smaller number of women of
reproductive age), coupled to an increase in mortality linked to the aging
population.
6.          Table 4 shows that Bulgaria's natality is at the low end amongst the countries
of Eastem Europe and tends towards Western Europe's pattern. In recent years, the lack of
population growth has been exacerbated by an important emigration of young adults.
Although the Total Fertility Rate shows a decline from 2.31 in 1960 to 1.45 in 1993, there is
little use of modem methods of family planning.
7.    Reproductive health has the same characteristics as in most East European countries
i.e. reliance on abortion as the main method of fertility control. While the contraceptive



- 87 -                Annex 2
Page 4 of 19
prevalence rate was estimated to be 76% in the late 1970s, it was mainly traditional methods.
The number of abortions is reported to be around 130,000-150,000 per year over the last ten
years. The ratio of abortions to live births was 1,480 abortions per 1,000 births in 1992.
This corresponds approximately to an average of 2.3 abortions per woman during her
reproductive period. This situation appears due in part to (i) the high cost of contraception
in comparison to abortion; (ii) the lack of adequate contraceptive education at the time of
abortion; (iii) the lack of involvement of the medical and paramedical professions in
contraception, except for gynecologists; and (iv) cultural factors.
mI. HEALTH STATUS
8.         If the lack of improvement of the health situation of the adult population, in
particular for males (reduced life expectancy of males, increased cardio- and cerebrovascular
pathology), is a long standing problem, the deterioration of infant health appeared at the end
of the 1980s. Life expectancy at birth for males has not improved since 1960 (from 67.8
years in 1960 to 67.6 years in 1992) and actually has decreased since 1965, when it reached
68.8 years (Table 5). By comparison life expectancy at birth for males is 75 in Sweden, 73
in France and 74 in The Netherlands. There is also a clear excess mortality among males
between the ages of 15 and 49. The death rate (age 15 - 49) in 1991 was 2.17/1,000 males
and of 0.97/1,000 females. This remains a major health problem for the health sector in
Bulgaria.
9.          Tables 6 and 7 indicate that in 1991 Bulgaria's health indicators were lagging
behind many European countries. However, when compared to countries of similar per
capita income (Table 7) Bulgaria has better health than the average Lower-Middle-Income
Country.
A. Health Indicators
10.        Between 1960 and 1990 the trends in health indicators show that:
(a)   Life expectancy in Bulgaria is low compared to most European countries, in
particular for men (67.6 in 1992), and has not improved since 1965.
(b)   Infant mortality has decreased from 45.1 per 1,000 live births in 1960, to
13.6 in 1988, it should be noted, however, that there has been a recent
significant increase in infant mortality (from 13.6 per thousand in 1988 to 16.9
per thousand in 1991 with a decrease to 15.9 in 1992 and to 15.5 in 1993).



- 88 -                 Annex 2
Page 5 of 19
This level is high for Europe (the 22nd highest out of 27 European countries)
with prematurity and perinatal mortality being especially high.
(c)   In spite of a substantial decrease over the past 30 years, maternal mortality
(20 per 100,000 live births in 1980-90) is among the highest in Europe (25th
highest out of 27 European countries).
(d)   A rise in the mortality rate of the population in the 40 - 59 age group
(from 3.4 per thousand in 1960 to 4.6 in 1993 for the 40-49 age group, and
from 8.1 per thousand in 1960 to 10.6 per thousand in 1993 for the 50-59 age
group).
(e)   Rural Bulgaria presents very different demographic and health indicators than
the urban part of the country (see Table 8). Such differences may be due to:
(i) the migration of the active population to the cities; (ii) lower economic and
social development of rural areas; and (iii) lower access to quality health
services. Expectedly, an older rural population experiences a higher crude
death rate but there is also a real excess mortality in rural areas as evidenced
by the age specific death rates by causes for infants and children (see Tables 9
and 10).
B. Causes of Death
11.         The main causes of death, in 1993, were Cardiovascular diseases (62.7%),
Cancer (14.3%), Senility and other Ill-defined Conditions (5.1%), Accidents, Poisoning and
Violence (5.1 %), and Respiratory System diseases (5.6%) (see Table 11). This is not
unexpected in a country with an aging population. Among infants the main causes of
mortality are: (i) conditions related to the perinatal period; (ii) congenital malformation;
(iii) diseases of the respiratory system; (iv) Accidents, Poisoning and Violence; and
(v) infectious diseases.
Adult Mortality
12.         The mortality due to cardiovascular diseases in Bulgaria is among the highest
in Europe and in particular among males. The standardized mortality rate at age 0-64 for
diseases of the circulatory system was 160 per 100,000 population in 1990, thus placing
Bulgaria in the 25th position in the group of 27 European countries. Among circulatory
system diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, in Bulgaria, have the highest mortality in Europe
and ischemic heart diseases have the 20th highest mortality among the 27 European
Countries. This problem is most serious because, in contrast with the general trends in



- 89 -                 Annex 2
Page 6 of 19
Europe, it has worsened in Bulgaria on an average of 2% per year during the 1980s.
Arterial hypertension is frequent, even in young adults.
13.         The cancer Standardized Mortality Rate (SMR) for age 0-64 was
91/100,000 population in 1990, which is below the European average, but rising. Under age
65, the standardized cancer mortality is 30.7 per 100,000 for digestive organs, 21.4 for
trachea/bronchus/lung, 15.6 for breast and 4.2 for cervix (see table 7). Mortality for
digestive organs and the uterine cervix are higher than the European averages, and are rising.
14.         The standardized mortality rate (SMR 0-64) for diseases of the respiratory
system was reported to be 70 in 1992 (24th highest among 31 European countries).
Respiratory infections are the second most frequent cause of hospitalization after delivery and
pregnancy. This may result from air pollution in some industrial areas, tobacco consumption
(4.1 kg per inhabitant as compared to 1.5 kg in Sweden, 2.3 kg in France and 3.0 kg in the
Netherlands in 1990), difficult living conditions, and inadequate health care services.
15.         Accidents and intoxications are a relatively important cause of morbidity and
mortality, especially in children (first cause of mortality in the 1-14 year age group), and in
the young adult male. In contrast with the regression noted in most other European countries,
mortality due to these causes was stable in Bulgaria over the last 10 years.
16.         Infectious and parasitic diseases are well controlled, with the exception of
respiratory infections among children. One should stress, however, that a deterioration of
the health system and/or of the socio-economic situation could easily reverse this process. A
case in point is the increased incidence of tuberculosis since 1990 and the epidemic of
measles in 1992.
Maternal and Infant Mortality
17.         Although enormous progress has been achieved in the last 30 years, indicators
of maternal and child health are still poor when compared with Western European countries.
Health status of children
18.         Perinatal mortality has fallen from 18.8/1.000 live births in 1960 to 10.8 in
1989, to rise again to 13.2 in 1992. In 1990 this was 7 in Sweden; 9 in France, and 10 in the
Netherlands. Infant mortality reached its lowest level in 1988 (13.6/1,000 live births) but
increased to 15.5/1,000 in 1993 (against 6 in Sweden, 7 in France, and 8 in the Netherlands
in the same year). Under-5 mortality rate is 21/1,000 (against 8 in Sweden, 9 in France
and 9 in the Netherlands in 1990).
19.         The main causes of infant mortality are, in decreasing order: (i) problems
related to the perinatal period (for instance delivery) (29%); (ii) congenital malformations



- 90 -                 Annex 2
Page 7 of 19
(26%) (360 congenital abnormalities/100,000 live births in Bulgaria, 168 in France, 222 in
Sweden, 274 in The Netherlands, 346 in Hungary, 444 in Poland); and (iii) pneumonia
(24%). In children aged 1 to 5 years, the main causes of death are respiratory diseases and
congenital abnormalities. The first cause of mortality from age 1 to 14 are accidents and
poisoning (36%).
Maternal Health
20.         Maternal mortality, with 20 maternal deaths for 100,000 live births in the
1980s, remains one of the highest in Europe. This could be due in part to inadequate labor
and delivery services and to the persistence of non-medical abortions in spite of their
legalization (apparently many women are unable to obtain the procedure during the 12 week
limit). The causes for this situation are certainly multiple but the quality of perinatal care,
the management of high risk pregnancy, the emergency referral system, abortion legislation
and management, and the availability of blood products appear to play an important role.
C. Morbidity
21.         The number of cases of illness registered in 1992 in medical establishments
was above 12 million of which 37% were children under 15 years or 2.7 contacts per child
per year. There was on average 1.1 registered illness per year and per adult in 1992. In the
same year, there was 1.4 million discharges from hospitals (17% were children under 15).
Among communicable diseases, the five most frequent ones, in 1992, were influenza,
chicken pox, measles, hepatitis and rubeola. In 1991, insured working personnel were
absent from work an average 7.48 days per person.
22.         The major reasons for consulting the general health services in 1993 were:
(i) diseases of respiratory system (41.8%); (ii) diseases of the nervous system and of the
sense organs (12,6%); (iii) diseases of the circulatory system (7.3%); (iv) diseases of the
skin and cellular tissue (7%); and (v) genito-urinary system (5.4%). Again in 1993, the
principal causes for hospitalization were: deliveries and complications of pregnancy
(18.8%), diseases of the respiratory system (16.5%), diseases of the circulatory system
(11.6%), and diseases of the genito-urinary system (9.4%).
23.         While the high degree of environmental pollution in Eastern European
countries is well known, (especially industrial pollution) it is not easy to demonstrate a clear
linkage with the morbidity. One should, however, mention the elevated lead contents of
blood in children and adults in Pernik, Plovdiv, Asenovgard, and Vratsa. A high incidence
of lung cancer has also been reported in highly polluted areas, such as in Southern Bulgaria
and in the area of Burgas (oil refinery). The role of environmental pollution in the high
infant mortality due to respiratory diseases and congenital malformations is less clear.

IV. HEALTH SERVICES
A. General Organization
24.         The Ministry of health had been traditionally responsible for developing health
policy, plans and budget, preparing health legislation, and evaluating the health status of the
country, as well as delivering most services. Parallel health systems also exist for special
groups of workers under the responsibility of the Armed Forces, the Ministry of Internal
Affairs, the Ministry of Transportation and the Enterprise Medical Services. Most services
are, however, publicly financed and publicly provided at no charge to the user. In 199?, the
responsibility for the delivery of primary and secondary care was decentralized from the
Ministry of Health to the Municipalities, which receive their budget directly from the
Ministry of Finance (see Annex 3). The Ministry of Health manages several National
Institutes and tertiary hospitals, paramedical schools, as well as a network of sanitary and
epidemiological centers (ex SANEPID in the Soviet system). The epidemiology and
sanitation centers have the responsibility , at the District level, for the quality of water, food,
control of communicable diseases, pollution and other pestilence. The organigram of the
Ministry of Health (MOH) is given in Chart 13. The National Center for Health
Informatics, under the Ministry of Health, gathers health statistics for the whole country.
25.         The private practice of medicine is presently authorized in Bulgaria but the
lack of a Medical Insurance system and the past reliance on "free" medical services as well
as the poor economic situation of the population have prevented the creation of a true private
sector. The present situation is characterized by the "after hours" participation in the private
sector of many publicly paid physicians but a total lack of incentives for them to forsake
their public positions.
26.         In 1993 the MOH gave high priority to addressing five main issues:
(a)    adopting a new mode of financing health services;
(b)    modifying the mode of practice of health care in particular the relationship
between medical specialties and between public and private sectors;
(c)   improving access to quality family planning services;
(d)    preparing and implementing a new pharmaceutical policy; and
(e)    restructuring some critical medical sectors such as emergency care,
transfusion services and oncology.

Page 9 of 19
B. Level of Services and Physical Infrastructure
27.         The front line of health services is made of Rural Health Centers and various
types of Polyclinics, according to the rural or urban status of the areas and their population
size. To a certain extent the ambulatory services of hospitals could also be included in this
basic category. In 1993, 3,393 Rural Health Centers, 51 public Polyclinics, 10 enterprise
Polyclinics and 93 dental clinics were operating. These basic structures refer their
complicated patients to 95 Community Hospitals, 30 District Hospitals, 11 Enterprise
Hospitals and to a large number of tertiary hospital structures (University, Institutes,
pediatrics, mental, maternity, pulmonary, sanatoria, etc.). At the top of the pyramid the
National Medical Institutes and the Medical Academy Hospital represent the ultimate
reference centers. In 1993 there were 88,910 hospital beds and 19,278 sanatorium beds.
28.         The health network provides a good coverage of the population. The quality of
the health services is however hindered by the lack of investment (lack of equipment), poorly
targeted recurrent budget (lack of consumables, low salaries of health professionals) and by
the lack of incentives in the primary health care sector. But in terms of quantity of
outpatient structures or hospital beds, Bulgaria with 1,056 beds per 100,000 population is
among the most richly endowed European countries (Belgium 830, Denmark 823, France
931, Ireland 385, Netherlands 594, Average for Europe 940). Many structures, however,
are old and have been poorly maintained. Many renovation will be needed in the next 20
years.
29.         The number of Government health facilities is more than adequate but these
structures are generaUly old, their technology obsolete and they lack modern management and
quality control. At the periphery, there have been shortages of (i) essential drugs which may
now be getting out of reach of some vulnerable groups because of costs; and (ii) diagnostic
and clinical medical equipment. Difficult working conditions and low salaries lead to low
morale among the health providers. As a result of these shortcomings, the PHC level has
deteriorated and the population tends to bypass the primary care level to seek care in
hospitals where free drugs and minimum standards of care remain available. The use of
secondary or tertiary care institutions to provide primary health care and, even at times,
social services increases unnecessarily the cost of health care delivery.
C. Human Resources
30.         A total of 28,457 physicians worked in the public sector in 1993 or 1/297
population. Between 1,500 and 2,000 physicians worked in the private sector. Eighty
percent of the physicians in the public sector are considered as specialists (20,000), including



- 93 -                 Annex 2
Page 10 of 19
3,641 pediatricians (1/466 children under 15 years), 1,594 gynecologists (1/1.350 women in
reproductive age), and 2,902 surgeons. The remaining 20% of the physicians that are not
specialists are not considered as general practitioners (this "specialty" does not exist in
Bulgaria) but rather are in transition toward some kind of specialization. The MOH
estimates that in 1993 12,700 physicians providing general medical services in ambulatory
settings. Data from the NCHI estimates at 3,900 visits per year for the "Generalist" and
3,700 for the pediatrician. To these activities should be added 562 home visits per year for
the "Generalist" and 575 for the Pediatrician. There were around 5,700 dentists and 2,400
pharmacistsin 1993, of which a large number were working in the national pharmaceutical
industry.
31.         The paramedical personnel working in the public sector numbered around
83,396 persons, of which 52,038 nurses (1.8/1 physician), 7,000 medical assistants
(Feldcher), 7,000 midwives, and 13,000 medical technicians (laboratory, radiology,
pharmacy and dental). The total number of employees in the health services (including
administrative and maintenance personnel) was 180.000. Wages of health professionals are
around 15% lower than the average national wages, a fact that does not motivate this
personnel.
32.         With one physician per 297 population in 1993 and one nurse per 101
population, the number of health providers is largely adequate. There are however serious
problems of adequacy of training, lack of quality continuing education and maldistribution
between GPs and specialists.
D. Utilization of Health Services
33.         Indicators of the utilization of health services show an increase of the services
activity until 1985/1986, followed by a progressive decrease. The total number of
consultations performed in public sector ambulatory structures was 46,219,500 in 1993 (5.5
visits for each inhabitant). This activity can be divided between the urban sector with 38.6
million visits, or 6.7 per inhabitant, and the rural sector with 7.7 million visits, or 2.8 per
inhabitant. One should note that the number of ambulatory visits has decreased by 29%
between 1985 and 1993 (by 28% in urban, and by 37% in rural areas). Ambulatory
consultations are provided in hospitals (approximately 55%), in polyclinics (30%), and in
Rural Health Centers (15%).
34.         The number of hospital admissions increased from 1.24 million in 1970 to
1.82 million in 1986. It then has fallen progressively to 1.58 in 1993. The ratio of
hospitalized cases to recorded cases of illness is relatively high, showing without doubt an
incapacity of the primary health services to treat many cases. This appears to be more
specific for adult (15% of the cases of illness in adults are hospitalized) than for children



- 94 -                 Annex 2
Page 11 of 19
(5.9% of the recorded cases of illness are hospitalized), pediatricians managing their charge
more efficiently. One should perhaps revise this evaluation in the light of factors that were
insufficiently known to the mission (such as "social" hospitalization of the aged and disabled,
gratuity of the drugs for hospital patients).
35.         Table 12 indicates that the decrease in the utilization of health services
involves the adult patients (-20% recorded cases of illness and -10% hospitalized patients
between 1986 and 1993) and children (-18% recorded cases and -9% hospitalized patients).
The decline is more noticeable for ambulatory visits (-29% between 1985 and 1993) than for
hospitalization (-14%).
36.         The occupancy rate of hospitals has decreased in the last years. It went down
from an average of 87% in 1985 to 74% in 1993. This decline has mostly affected District
and Community hospitals (-23% and -25% respectively). As is usual in most countries, the
data show in 1993, as in previous years, that the more peripheral and the more specialized
the structure the lower the occupancy rate becomes. Thus the Medical Schools Hospitals had
an occupancy rate of 85% in 1993, compared to 68% for the 30 District hospitals, 65% for
the 91 Community hospitals and only 26% for rural units. One should also note that the
occupancy rate is maintained at that level only because the average duration of the stay in
hospital is long (13.8 days).

ORGANIZATION AND FINANCE OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM
I. INTRODUCTION
1.          The Bulgarian health system is characteristic of former socialist economies,
with: (i) tax-based financing; (ii) public sector provision of services; (iii) universal access to
comprehensive care; (iv) centralized planning and management; (v) extensive infrastructure
and staffing; and (vi) few incentives for consumers or providers to increase efficiency,
control costs and improve the quality of care. Recognizing the positive contribution of the
public health system to the improvement in health status over the past forty years
(particularly in combatting infectious diseases), it is nonetheless clear that inefficient
allocation of resources is limiting the effectiveness of the system in preventing and reversing
recent declines in health status. The country has embarked on a process of reform of the
health system, aimed at maintaining broad access to care, while developing alternative
inancing and reimbursement mechanisms, encouraging private sector health services,
decentralizing the management of public services, streamlining the public network and
introducing appropriate incentives for efficiency and quality of care. Reform to date has
been slow and tentative, as the country struggles to achieve political consensus on the
direction and pace of change. The Ministry of Health (MOH), responsible for development
and implementation of health policy, has a formidable task ahead in linking strategic options
to agreed objectives, and building a national consensus through public awareness and social
marketing of proposed reforms.
II. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEME    OF HEALTH SERVICES
2.          The public sector health system is organized along the lines of district and
municipal administration. The territory consists of 27 districts plus the capital city,
encompassing more than 270 municipalities. It has been decided to group the 27 districts
into nine larger regions, but no administrative structure is in place to operationalize this
decision. The hierarchy of public health facilities consists of: (i) rural health posts, district
health centers and urban polyclinics (freestanding and hospital-based) for ambulatory care;
(ii) municipal hospitals (250-300 beds each) and district hospitals (1,000 beds each) for
secondary care; and (iii) medical academies and a wide variety of specialized hospitals and
institutes for tertiary care. The public sector health system also includes an extensive, but
poorly performing, network of emergency medical services (EMS), and a network of 27



-106 -           Annex 3
Page 3 of 16
district and four regional Blood Transfusion Centers. The health information system is
maintained by the National Center for Health Information (NCHI)and its 28 district offices,
while public health, environmental concerns and food safety are addressed through national
and district-based Sanitary and Epidemiologic Inspectorates. In addition, parallel health
systems, including both ambulatory and inpatient facilities, are maintained by the Ministries
of Transport, Interior, Labor and Defense. Although these systems are financed
predominantly out of general revenues, they are restricted to specific social or occupational
groups (e.g. transport workers). Private sector health services were authorized in 1991.
Private services have grown rapidly in the pharmaceutical sector (para. 12) and in dentristry,
with the establishment of approximately 1,700 private pharmacies and 6,000 private dentists.
The development of other types of private medical services has been slowed by, among other
factors, the lack of an appropriate financing mechanism.
3.          Thus far, the most fundamental reform of the Bulgarian health system is
contained in the 1991 Law on Municipal Autonomy which decentralized management and
financing of district-based health facilities to the municipalities in which they are located.
Even district hospitals and district-based, specialized institutes, both of which have catchment
areas extending beyond a single municipality, fall under the jurisdiction of the municipality in
which they are located. Many regulations hampering municipal management of facilities
have been abolished in recent years. A municipal Commission on Health Care, consisting of
health and social welfare personnel elected by the population, has responsibility for
management of the municipal health system, and reports directly to the Municipal Council.
District health authorities reporting directly to the MOH have a much diminished role
relative to the past, with the Regional Center for Health Information serving as a conduit for
information from the local level to the center. District-based health facilities have the legal
status of municipal enterprises, limiting their managerial and financial autonomy. For
example, while hospital directors have been granted some flexibility in staffing decisions,
they must work within a fixed wage envelope determined by municipal authorities which
cannot be reallocated to non-wage expenditures. National-level institutes and hospitals have
the status of autonomous public enterprises--with some falling under the supervision of the
MOH.
4.          District and municipal health services are financed almost exclusively from a
Municipal Budget (MB) which is distinct from the central, or Republican Budget (RB).
While municipalities do have a limited tax base of their own, tax administration in Bulgaria
is largely centralized, and the Municipal Budget is dominated by transfers from central
budgetary revenues. A key issue following the decentralization of health system management
has been the need to match resources at the municipal level with health care responsibilities,
particularly when catchment areas extend beyond a single municipality. Measures to ensure
this have thus far been inadequate (para. 19). Furthermore, economic contraction during the
initial stage of the transition has imposed severe resource constraints on the health system--
particularly at the municipal level. In many municipalities, more than half of the municipal
budget is allocated to health services. In a highly resource-constrained environment,



- 107 -           Annex 3
Page 4 of 16
municipal authorities are seeling ways to consolidate and restructure the public system and
reallocate resources toward more cost-effective health interventions. However, structural
reform at the municipal level has been hampered by: (i) lack of clear policy directives from
the center; (ii) unclear legislative authority to take decisions on restructuring and
reallocation; and (iii) lack of experience in using financial and service utilization data to
make managerial decisions.
5.           Increasing the efficiency of resource use in the public health system will
require greater managerial autonomy for health facilities and the restructuring of financial
incentives through the development of new cost reimbursement mechanisms. The MOH
intends to promote these objectives through use of a contracting system between health
facilities and municipalities (in an initial stage) and among health facilities, the proposed
health financing administration and municipalities or client groups (in a later stage). Such a
system would require, inter alia, change in the legal status of health facilities and
development of cost parameters on which to base reimbursement. The NCHI has
spearheaded an effort to develop simple cost accounting in municipal and district hospitals
and determine the cost basis for health care reimbursement (para. 20). Pilot activities to test
contractual arrangements and develop reimbursement mechanisms are proposed, and should
be pursued in tandem with efforts to revise the legal and regulatory framework for
ownership, management and financing of public and private health services.
Public Sector Health Infrastructure
6.          Hospital Care. The public sector health system in Bulgaria is plagued with:
(i) excess capacity; (ii) poor differentiation of services for ambulatory, emergency and
inpatient care; and, in recent years; (iii) declining utilization rates. With 12.8 hospital beds
per 1,000 population (10.3 acute care beds and 2.5 sanitoria/rehabilitation beds), inpatient
capacity is high by European standards--and all the more so given Bulgaria's income level
(Tables 1 and 2). The situation has scarcely improved during the transition. Inpatient
capacity in sanatoria and other rehabilitation centers fell by 15 percent in the 1990-92 period,
but capacity in acute care hospitals fell by less than one percent. Bulgarian hospitals tend to
have more separate wards for sub-specialties than comparable hospitals in Western Europe,
and occupancy rates are frequently low. Although capacity is excessive, facilities tend to be
old and poorly maintained, with obsolete technology and--as the fiscal crisis deepens--
shortages of spare parts, medical supplies and drugs. This is especially true at the municipal
level and in rural areas, where budget constraints have been tightest. The resulting decline
in the quality of care is undoubtedly one factor accounting for the fall in average occupancy
rate, from 87 percent in 1985 to 73 percent in 1992. Occupancy rates have dropped furthest
for district and municipal hospitals (to 73 and 69 percent, respectively, in 1992), and are
extremely low for rural hospitals (22 percent). This is so, despite a long average length of
stay (13.8 days) in hospitals, which boosts occupancy figures but is indicative of
inefficiencies in inpatient care.

Page 5 of 16
7.          Outpatient Care. Although hospitalization rates have declined in recent
years, the ratio of hospitalizations to cases of illness remains relatively high, most probably
reflecting the failure of outpatient services to effectively treat patients. Indeed, utilization of
outpatient facilities has fallen far more dramatically than hospital use. Outpatient visits per
capita rose from 5.0 in 1970 to 7.3 in 1985, before declining steadily to only 5.3 in 1992.
Large disparities exist between use of outpatient services in urban areas (6.9 visits per capita)
and rural areas (2.9 visits per capita). The primary care network is extensive, with one
ambulatory care center per 2,300 population in 1992. However, nearly 60 percent of these
are rural health posts with limited access to essential drugs and supplies. In fact, primary
care services in Bulgaria tend to be poorly differentiated from emergency medical services,
and the country lacks effective "front line" family medicine, particularly in rural areas. As a
result, hospitals provide a disproportionate share of primary health services--one reason
hospitals account for 55 percent of all outpatient visits (urban polyclinics provide another 30
percent). In coming years, high priority must be accorded to the strengthening of "front
line" preventive and curative primary care services in both the public and private sector, in
order to reverse deteriorating health status and avoid using hospitals as costly providers of
routine primary care.
8.          Emergency Care. Strengthening the front line will depend on disentangling
routine primary health services from emergency care, and making emergency medical
services (EMS) a fast and reliable link between primary and secondary facilities. Among the
weaknesses of the existing EMS are:
a.    unclear mandate which covers emergency care, routine primary health care,
home visits and miscellaneous transport needs;
b.    decentralized administration;
c.    poor integration between mobile services and hospital emergency wards;
d.    lack of polyvalent emergency rooms;
e.    oversized, obsolete and unreliable ambulance fleet; and,
f.   inappropriate staffing patterns, with overspecialized physicians and
undertrained paramedical staff.
To rectify this situation, the MOH intends to strengthen EMS through: (i) recentralization of
EMS administration; (ii) development of an integrated telecommunications system;
(iii) downsizing and upgrading of the ambulance fleet; (iv) redeployment and retraining of
staff; (v) reorganization and reequipment of emergency rooms; and (vi) revising emergency
medicine curricula.

Health Personnel
9.          Table 3 summarizes the recent evolution of staffing levels in the public sector
health system. The total number of personnel (not including MOH personnel) fell by eight
percent in the 1990-92 period, to around 117,000. All categories of staff declined, with the
number of physicians falling least (5 percent) and the number of pharnacists and pharmacy
assistants falling most (40 and 23 percent, respectively). These figures are in keeping with
the establishment of approximately 1,700 private pharmacies in Bulgaria by end-1993. It is
also believed that most of the nearly 1,500 physicians to leave public service are in private
practice in Bulgaria or abroad.
10.         With 3.1 physicians per 1,000 population and 2.4 nursing persons (nurses,
midwives, feldchers) per physician, medical staffing levels are in the upper range for
European countries, and more than adequate to address the needs of the population (Table 2).
However, medical staff tend to be poorly and/or inappropriately trained to meet the basic
health care needs of the population. Eighty percent of physicians are specialists (including
14 percent pediatricians and 6 percent gynecologists), with most of the remaining generalists
studying towards their specialization. Medical education lacks a family medicine curriculum
and produces no general practitioners--although more than 40 percent of physicians work at
the primary care level. Likewise, nurses are not trained as nurse practitioners. Pre-service
and in-service training in family medicine, coupled with better supply of essential drugs to
peripheral areas, will be the key to improved quality of primary health care in coming years.
11.         Average wages for public sector health personnel have traditionally trailed
behind average wages in the formal economy, but rose by approximately 20 percent in real
terms between 1989 and 1992. Wage and employment policy is determined through
negotiation between the MOH and the trade unions representing health personnel. AR staff
reduction and redeployment must be negotiated with the trade unions, which are entitled to
participate in all management decisions of health facilities. The most recent Sector
Agreement (April 1993) establishes wage rates for five categories of health facilities based on
coefficients applied to an adjusted minimum salary. The base pay scale is quite flat, with a
maximum salary of only 2.7 times the minimum. However, bonuses for advanced degrees,
specializations, seniority and specific fields (e.g. surgery, anaesthesiology, emergency care)
add as much as 70 percent or more to base salaries. Within the framework of the Sector
Agreement, the MOH establishes an average gross wage for all municipally-funded facilites
which then determines the budgetary envelope for the MB wagebill. In addition,
municipalities have the right to increase the average gross wage for health (and education)
personnel by as much as 20 percent as an added incentive, using municipal resources or
savings generated within municipal transfers. For 1994, the average gross wage in force for
municipally-funded facilities is 3,344 BGL/month. For tertiary facilities funded by the
Republican Budget, the average gross wage established ranges from 4,300-4,800 BGL/month
depending on the facility. Including various bonuses, specialized physicians in tertiary care

facilities may earn 7,000-10,000 BGL/month, which is 2.0-2.5 times that of a physician in a
primary health center.
Pharmaceutical MArket
12.         During the socialist era, the State had a monopoly on pharmaceutical
production, import-export and distribution in Bulgaria. In 1991, the market was liberalized,
including: (i) authorization of private sector importers, wholesalers and retailers;
(ii) dissolution of public sector production facilities into 20 independent, state-owned
factories; (iii) dissolution of public sector distribution facilties into 28 state-owned district
wholesalers; and (iv) authorization for health facilities to purchase drugs on the open market.
As a result of these measures, the private sector has grown quickly--a largely positive
development--albeit in a virtually unregulated manner. Procurement by the public sector has
become highly fragmented, resulting in inefficiencies due to small volume purchases, poor
market information and general inexperience at the facility level. The number of registered
substances and dosage forms has increased threefold (nearly 1,000 substances and 3,600
dosage forms by end-1993) due to a surge in imports, while domestic drug industries have
sought bigger profits and foreign exchange earnings by exporting 80 percent of their
production.
13.         Pricing policy for pharmaceuticals is evolving. Prices on domestic production
are loosely controlled in the domestic market (cost plus 20 percent margin). Price controls
in the domestic market add to incentives to export at uncontrolled prices. Import prices are
not controlled, but internal distribution margins for imported drugs were regulated (3 percent
for import handling, 25 percent for wholesale/retail distribution) starting in 1993. Use of ad
valorem margins, however, adds to incentives to market more expensive drugs and dosage
forms. Reimbursement policy has also fueled cost escalation. The state reimburses 100
percent of drug costs in inpatient facilites and 25-100 percent for drugs bought in public and
private pharmacies, depending on the substance. In addition, the state reimburses 100
percent of drug costs for households below the poverty line, and 50 percent of drug costs for
households between 100 and 130 percent of the poverty line. No cap is placed on state
reimbursement for specific drugs, encouraging the use of more expensive brands and dosage
forms. Reimbursement mechanisms have also not kept pace with development of the private
market: private pharmacies submit invoices for reimbursement through hospital pharmacies--
an inappropriate administrative burden for public hospitals.
14.         The National Drug Institute (NDI), charged with implementation of drug
policy, regulation of the market and drug registration, quality control and inspection,
suggests that existing reimbursement policy is both overly complex and fiscally
unsustainable. The state covered nearly 75 percent of the cost of the BGL 3.8 billion spent
on drugs in 1992, amounting to about 17 percent of public health expenditures. This is a
relatively high share by international standards, and fiscal contraction in 1993 and 1994 have
strained the capacity of the state to maintain drug expenditures, resulting in payment delays

and drug shortages. Improving the cost-effectiveness of drug expenditures will be a high
priority for the NDI in coming years. A new Drug Law establishing the basic regulatory
framework for the pharmaceutical market has been submitted to Parliament, and awaits
action. In addition, the MOH intends to take measures aimed at: (i) capping drug
reimbursement rates; (ii) developing appropriate administrative mechanisms for
reimbursement; (iii) promoting rational drug use; and (iv) establishing a bulk procurement
capability within the public sector,
m. FINANCING OF HEALTH SERVICES
15.         Health services in Bulgaria are financed almost entirely from general tax
revenues allocated via the budget, with 2-3 percent of revenues deriving from out-of-pocket
user fees (mostly for pharmaceuticals). Budget allocations are based largely on historic
levels which tend to reflect fixed and quasi-fixed inputs: number of facilities, beds and staff.
Ailocations do not reflect anticipated service volume, nor have they been adjusted to take
into account shifting pattems of service utilization in recent years. At the municipal level,
municipal transfers have historically been the subject of political negotiation, and have not
necessarily reflected the changing needs of the health system, and shifting pattems of facility
use.
Revenue and Reimbursement Mechanisms
16.         Tax-based health systems offer the advantages of facilitating universal access
to care and minimizing financial risk for health care consumers. However, the existing
budgeting system for public health facilities in Bulgaria suffers from the following
weaknesses: (i) few incentives for cost consciousness among consumers, who pay no out-of-
pocket costs for care; (ii) no transfer of financial risk (or reward) to providers in order to
create incentives to improve efficiency, consolidate redundant services and improve quality to
attract clientele; and (iii) no reimbursement mechanism for private services which would
permit private sector development. Fiscal contraction in recent years has also sparked a
search for new sources of revenue to finance health services. Initially, adoption of
contributory national health insurance legislation tended to be viewed as a panacea for these
problems. Various interest groups compromised on draft legislation which was submitted to
Parliament in 1993. However, the initial draft raises two fundamental questions: (i) the
feasibility of a contribution-based insurance system in the present Bulgarian context; and
(ii) the administrative practicality of a decentralized institutional framework.
17.         The draft Health Insurance Law establishes a system which is ostensibly
financed predominantly from payroll contributions. However, payroll contributions in
Bulgaria already account for nearly 60 percent of gross wage payments--a very high rate
which significantly distorts the cost of labor in the economy. Increasing this rate to 68-72



-112 -            Annex 3
Page 9 of 16
percent--a conservative estimate of the cost of health services--would be unacceptable in any
country, but all the more so in a country facing the social pressure of mounting
unemployment associated with the economic transition. Additional payroll taxation does not
represent a source of significant financing for the health system. Initially, the Health
Insurance Law proposed the establishment of 28 independent, non-profit insurance companies
with territorial monopolies for compulsory insurance. However, it was ultimately recognized
that their risk pools would be too small for optimal risk-sharing. Revised legislation has
subsequently proposed the establishment of one national insurance company, with 28
branches. However, the issue of excessive payroll taxation has not been adequately
addressed.
18.         The proposed insurance legislation provides a framework for health financing,
without defining specific reimbursement mechanisms. Some type of contracting between
providers and insurers is assumed, and yet, it is the development of new reimbursement
mechanisms which will determine the incentives for increased efficiency, improved quality of
care and development of private health services. Without first defining these reimbursement
mechanisms, it is difficult to assess the impact of introducing health insurance on the demand
and supply of services, and on public spending for health. Indeed, legitimate concerns about
uncontrolled cost escalation--particularly at a time of severe fiscal austerity--have reduced the
political urgency of adopting health insurance legislation. In the meantime, the Ministries of
Health and Finance, as well as the National Center for Health Information (NCHI) and the
National Insurance Research and Development Center (NIRDC) have begun to define and
test new reimbursement mechanisms for health services.
19.         In the absence of more fundamental financial reform, the Ministries of Health
and Finance have sought to improve the existing system of municipal budgeting by
developing "objective criteria" to determine municipal transfers. However, political
opposition to changing historic transfer levels has been strong, and the logic guiding the
chosen methodology is unclear. Furthermore, while the methodology determines the global
envelope of transfers to each municipality, it does nothing to change the incentives facing
health facilities and other municipal services--a change that can only occur through
development of new reimbursement mechanisms. According to the methodology, municipal
transfers are determined by: (i) historic levels adjusted for inflation; (ii) capital investments
(proposed by the municipality); (iii) per capita income in the municipality; and (iv) a
weighted set of 17 "objective criteria". The set of criteria is heavily weighted (63 percent)
toward three factors: population, number of settlements and number of secondary school
students. Ratios of patients per bed in municipal and district hospitals account for 13 percent
of the weighting. Overall, the rationale behind the numerous criteria and their weighting is
unclear. However, the objective criteria applied to only 11 percent of the aggregate
municipal transfer in 1994, resulting in little reallocation of resources relative to the past.
20.         Efforts to rationalize municipal transfers should be pursued, with an improved
methodology. In general, municipal budgets should be based directly on unit costs for



-113 -           Annex 3
Page 10 of 16
municipal services provided (e.g. cost of secondary education per pupil, per household cost
of trash collection, etc.). Similarly, for municipal health services, budgets should reflect
activity levels--reimbursing for services rendered--with phasing out of underutilized and/or
redundant facilities and services. In fact, the public health system has the necessary cost and
utilization data to develop a more flexible budgeting system based on services rendered and
identify necessary streamlining of the system. For the past few years, the NCHI has
introduced simple cost accounting (by ward and by expenditure category) in municipal and
district hospitals and polyclinics to complement patient and utilization data traditionally
collected for the health information system. While the financial accounting system is in an
early phase--with associated problems of data reliability and data processing capabilities-it
does provide a sufficient basis for calculating average costs, developing simple, cost-based
reimbursement mechanisms and making efficiency comparisons. The NCHI intends to carry
out pilot activities to improve district resource allocation, by using existing financial and
service utilization data to: (i) identify the potential for streamlining public health services;
and (ii) develop reimbursement mechanisms which create financial incentives for efficient
resource allocation.
21.         Building on the work of the NCHI, the NIRDC has outlined a medium-term
strategy to introduce a case-mix, diagnosis-related approach to hospital reimbursement,
based on grouping of patients according to ICD-9 categories. Initially, patients would be
grouped by ward only, with reimbursement based on average unit costs per ward.
Gradually, diagnostic groups would be separated from the ward groupings, with
reimbursement based on average cost of treatment. Successful implementation of such a
system will require refinement of the cost accounting system, strengthening of financial
analysis and development of more complex administrative mechanisms. Financial and
technical support from the international community is being sought for medium term
development of this reimbursement mechanism. At the same time, more attention should be
focused on the relatively easier task of developing a reimbursement mechanism for outpatient
family practice, in order to strengthen primary care and support the emergence of private
sector general practitioners.
Trends in Health EWenditures
22.         As in other former socialist countries, the initial phase of the transition has
entailed economic and fiscal contraction, with gross domestic product falling by 25 percent
and government spending by 40 percent in real terms between 1989 and 1993. Despite this
unprecedented contraction, the Government succeeded in maintaining--and even moderately
increasing (by seven percent)--aggregrate real spending for health during this period
(Table 4). This is in marked contrast to most other former socialist economies, where
economic contraction has resulted, to varying degrees, in compression of real health
expenditures. As a result, public spending for health rose as a share of GDP from 3.4
percent in 1989 to 5.4 percent in 1992--a level which is not high by Western European
standards, but is in the upper range for countries at Bulgaria's income level. Given the



- 114 -           Annex 3
Page 11 of 16
magnitude of the general fiscal contraction, health expenditures more than doubled as a share
of government spending, from 5.8 percent in 1989 to 11.9 percent in 1992. However,
Bulgaria could not sustain this level of health expenditures as the transition deepened. Fiscal
pressures have made spending cuts inevitable, with public spending on health falling as a
share of GDP to 5.1 percent in 1993 and 4.7% of GDP in 1994.
23.         All growth in real spending for health in the 1989-93 period was for current
expenditures. An initial surge in the wagebill was tempered in later years, while spending
for drugs, operating costs and other goods and services increased moderately, peaking in
1992. In contrast, capital spending, including rehabilitation and new investment, declined by
around 20 percent in real terms. Virtually all expenditure categories experienced cutbacks in
1993 and 1994. Reductions were ad hoc in nature, with little restructuring of the public
health system. The challenge for Government in the next few years will be to selectively
maintain public spending in those areas which have the greatest impact on the health status of
the population, while eliminating inefficient and ineffective uses of public resources.
24.         Of greatest concern for the health status of the population is the fact that all
growth in health spending in recent years has accrued exclusively to the Republican Budget,
which supports specialized tertiary care and health administration. Spending for the
Republican Budget increased by 60 percent in real terms between 1989 and 1992, while
spending for the Municipal Budget--which supports more cost-effective primary and
secondary care--virtually stagnated.Y As a result, municipal spending fell as a share of total
health expenditures from 81 percent in 1989 to 72 percent in 1992. This at a time when
resources need to be shifted into basic health services, which have the greatest impact on
health status and the greatest potential to protect vulnerable groups from disease and
premature death during the transition. Failure to restructure and streamline the public sector
health infrastructure at all levels has hindered the reallocation of resources toward more cost-
effective interventions. The trend in spending was reversed in 1993, with real expenditures
under the Republican Budget falling by eight percent, and municipal spending increasing by
seven percent. However, this reversal does not entirely compensate for past trends, leaving
relative spending for the Municipal Budget well below pre-transition levels.
25.         Given the severity of revenue shortfalls, it is remarkable that Government
maintained--and even modestly increased--real spending in health throughout the 1989-93
period. Investment spending alone suffered significant real declines--a not wholly
undesirable outcome, given the nature of the investments which have been selected. The
public investment program during the transition has been a hodge-podge of inappropriate
projects, not subject to objective economic and social evaluation criteria. The 1993 "priority"
investment program consisted almost entirely of construction and completion of specialized
I' This is true after adjusting for the transfer of certain health services (e.g. Regional Centers for Health
Information, Regional Sanitary Inspectorates) to the Republican budget, beginning in 1992.

Page 12 of 16
tertiary care hospitals and secondary hospitals for parallel health systems with restricted
access (e.g. transport workers only). If completed, the 1993 program would have added at
least 1,500-2,000 hospital beds to existing, underutilized inpatient capacity. New investment
needs to be linked to rationalization of existing infrastructure. As it now stands,the program
is an amalgam of special interest projects proposed by municipalities and the medical
community, with the Ministries of Health and Finance playing no role in the selection of
investments which are most cost-effective (i.e. produce the greatest improvement in health
status for the least cost). This is unfortunate, for the investment needs of the sector are
great, in order to strengthen front line primary care, rehabilitate emergency and blood supply
services and upgrade outmoded hospital equipment. Despite a justifiable tendency toward
decentralization in the management of the public health sector, it will be important in coming
years to recognize the legitimate role of the central government (in this case, the Ministries
of Health and Finance) in establishing public investment policy and applying objective
criteria for arbitrage among competing investment proposals.

HEALTH SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
MINISTRY OF HEALTH
STATEMENT OF POLICY DIRECTIONS
FOR HEALTH SECTOR REFORM
Policy Objectives
1.   The health policy of Ministry of Health (MoH) will be directed
towards the achievement of the following priority objectives:
a.   Protect and improve the health status of the population with
regard to specific risk groups;
b.   Restructure the health care system based on primary health
care aimed at improving the health status and encourage a
healthy lifestyle as well as improve the health system
performance;
c.   Further develop the structural reform in the health sector in
conformity with the elaborated National Health Strategy;
d.   Guarantee equal access, equity and justice in the health care
for all citizens.
2.   Health care policy shall preserve its social character and it is aimed at
improving peoples' health , preventing diseases, improving the efficiency of
health care by improving the quality of services and achieving a just
allocation of resources. During the process of implementing it is essential to
maintain the political and social trust of the people in the health care
reform.
3.   In this respect the achievement of a balance between rapid and
tangible results in certain essential health care fields will be essential.

Strategyfor reform
4.   To achieve the objectives of health policy MoH has finalized a
National Health Strategy based on in-depth analysis of the exsting
situation, problems and priority areas for action in the health sector. A
further step in this respect will be the development of a National Action
Plan for the implementation of the strategy. The MoH has focused its
activities based on the following priority areas:
* reduction of cardio-vascular diseases;
* improving the prevention and treatment of neoplasms;
* reduction of infant mortality;
. improving the care for the aged population, the handicapped and the
unemployed
* protecting the health of women in reproductive age
In order to achieve progress in the a.m. priority areas coordination action
will be taken in the prevention of diseases, health promotion, PHC,
environmental health, women's health, perinatal care, blood transfusion and
other fields.
5.   The MoH is undertaking a legislative initiative to provide legal
grounds and regulations of the health sector reform activities. This initiative
includes the elaboration of new laws, amendments to the existing legislation
and development of new regulatory acts related to:
* management of health system
* hospital management
* health care financing
* the status of non-governmental medical associations
* private practice
* health promotion and disease prevention
* drug policy
6.   The process of change in the health system is aimed at promoting
more efficient and effective utilization of the resources allocated to meet
health demands. In this sense the change should be perceived as an
adaptation and restructuring of the existing health care system, taking into
account new quantitative or qualitative requirements. It is essential that this
process covers the demand for new financial, technical or technological
resources.

Restructuring of the health system
The effectiveness and efficiency of health care will be improved through the
restructuring and upgrading of the health system in order to adequately
adapt the country's health care institutions' infrastructure in accordance
with the modified health and demographic status of the population, the
decentralization process and the introduction of a health insurance system.
With respect to the system as a whole, the following measures have been or
will be taken:
a.   Creation of Regional health authorities. Such regional bodies
have been created with the decree No. 145 of COM published
in State Gazette of 17.07.95 named as Regional Health
Centers.
b.   A uniform hospital management model was established aimed
at increased responsibility and accountability for performing
the management functions in an environment of greater
autonomy.
c.   Pilot projects started in 2 regions of the country (Smolyan and
Gabrovo) with the aim of introducing and testing basic
elements of a health insurance system.
d.   Re-establishment of the National Public Health Center and the
National Center for Health Promotion is foreseen in the near
future.
7.  In addition, the MoH will undertake other activities outlined in the
National Health Strategy (NHS) (a copy of which is supplied to the WB
administration). The sequence in order and time of those activities will be
given in the National Action Plan (NAP).
8.   Provision of high-priority, basic health services will be ensured
through restructuring and upgrading of the key networks outlined below.
Prim=r Health care
9.   On May 31st 1994, the MoH issued ordinance no. 10, distinguishing
primary health care services from emergency medical services and defining
their respective roles in providing 24-hour care. Starting this year the MoH



- 124 -                  Amex4
Page 4 of 7
will contract with the municipalities to upgrade basic equipment and
facilities for primary care and provide training in general practice medicine
and community health, contingent on municipal commitment to:
a.   rationalize PHC coverage through adjustments in infrastructure
and staffing, with particular regard for underserved areas;
b.  implement a standard PHC package including 24-hour curative
care, a range of freventive services related to maternal and
child health and other preventive and promotive activities
according to national disease priorities;
These commitments will be adapted to the needs of each municipality.
Commitment contracts will be signed with approximately 75 municipalities
to carry out these activities in the next 5 years.
Emergency Medical Services
10.  The COM  issued a decree on 17.02.1994 to create a centralized
emergency medical service (EMS) under national authority in an initial 7
districts (ordinance no. 37). A second decree was approved by COM on
29.09.1994 to extend this to an additional 7 districts, and Government
intends to progressively establish a centralized EMS administration nation-
wide. The MoH also issued ordinance no. 7 on 25.05.1994 to define the
structure and functions of EMS centers and establish the legal framework
for their operation. The MoH has begun signing separation protocols with
municipalities to transfer local EMS assets (vehicles, staff, equipment) to
central authorities. This is a prerequisite to an ongoing program for
restructuring and upgrading of EMS which will:
a.   eliminate non-emergency, routine primary care and home-visits
from EMS;
b.   set up a modem EMS telecommunications network;
c.   establish and equip polyvalent emergency rooms;
d.   downsize and modernize the ambulance fleet, and adjust staff
accordingly;
e.  improve integration of mobile services and hospital emergency
rooms;

Blood Transfusion
11. As a first step in a programme to improve the supply and safety of
blood and blood products, Parliament passed the law on Blood Collection
and Transfusion on 30.03.94, establishing standards for the collection,
processing and transfusion of blood. At the same time, the MoH improved
the safety of the blood supply and adopted more efficient technology for the
blood collection by replacing glass bottles with plastic bags throughout the
system. MoH is now prepariig a decree to establish a centralized blood
transfusion network and transfer associated assets from the municipalities to
the central authorities. This is a part of a planned strategy to restructure and
rehabilitate the blood transfusion network which will:
a.   concentrate most blood processing and quality control activities in 5
Regional Transfusion Centers, downsizing the network by lirniting
smaller centers to blood collection functions only (phasing out other
functions and adjusting staff accordingly);
b.   upgrade the equipment and technology for blood collection and
processing in line with Council of Europe standards;
c.   re-organize the National Donor Recruitment program with non-
governmental involvement, and improve public relations techniques.
Health Fian
12.  Reform of health financing will seek to mobilize and increase the
efficiency of the existing health resources by adapting the health sector to
the new conditions of a market economy and budgetary constraints. To
begin this process, amendments to the existing Public Health Law are
prepared.
13.  A new draft Law on Health Insurance establishing the broad outlines
for a contributory national health insurance system will be finalized soon
and presented to Parliament. In order to better define the modalities for the
implementation of such a system the following activities are underway:
a.   MoH has approved a proposal for various methods of contracting the
amount and quality of medical services and their payment between
the consumers and providers of health care;



Annex 4
-126-                     Page 6 of 7
b.   a system of cost accounting by department and type of expenditure
has been introduced on a pilot basis in municipal level in-patient and
out-patient facilities;
c.   simple efficiency comparisons are being made on the basis of costs
data, and a link has been established between budgetary allocations
and service volume.
14.  In the next few years the capacity of MoH to analyze policy options
related to health finance and management will be strengthened while
reform will focus on:
a.   updating the existing health statistics information system and
facilities-based management information systems in accordance with
modern standards and streamlining the national health information
administration;
b.   short-term development of a flexible budgeting method to be adopted
by the Ministry of Finance for municipal and national level health
facilities which will explicitly link public resource allocation to the
volume of services rendered;   -
c.  longer-term development of case-mix, diagnosis-related method of
reimbursement for health services which will link resource allocation
to service volume as well as provide maximum incentives for
efficiency and cost-containment;
d.   defining the resource base (pay-roll contributions, budgetary
revenues, user fees etc.) expenditure (minimum package of insured
services) and contracting methods of a national health insurance
system;
e.   building the capacity and the authority of the MoH to evaluate and
select public investment proposals (at the central and municipal
levels) according to cost-effectiveness criteria;
f.   introduction of new postgraduate training system for experts having
higher or special medical education, which would include training in
health administration, management and marketing.

Concluding Remarks
15.  The new health care strategy requires shared responsibilities for the
development of the health sector and the application of practical
mechanisms of real partnership between the state institutions, the public
organizations and the health experts. Implementation of the strategy must
be spearheaded by every department of the MoH, which must internalize
the strategic aims and objectives, and take responsibility for acting upon
them.
16.  It is oriented toward the maximum utilization of the experience of the
developed countries, international institutions and organizations in the field
of health care and the implementation of the financial resources and know-
how provided by the latter.
17.  The achievement of the above defined aims and the implementation
of a health insurance system should guarantee high quality and accessible
health services for the Bulgarian population with the possibility of free
choice of physicians and medical institutions, and professional fulfillment
and an honored position in society for the medical community.
