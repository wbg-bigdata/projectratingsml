MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERN4ATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO
FOR AN EDUCATION SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Lesotho for SDR 18.9 million (US$25.2
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. Part I of this document
discusses Lesotho's development prospects and economic performance, and the
Bank Group's assistance strategy. It draws upon the fourth Policy
Framework Paper, covering the period 1991/92 to 1993/94, which was
considered by the committee of the whole on May 14, 1991. Part II of the
document describes the proposed credit.
I. Country Policies and Bank Group Assistance StrategR
Background
2.       Lesotho's economy is dominated by its dependence on South Africa,
which surrounds the small kingdom. About half of Lesotho's per capita
income of $440 (1989 est.) is derived from remittances of some 140,000
migrant workers in the neighboring republic. Simllarly, more than half its
budget revenues emanates from a South Africa-centered customs union. As a
member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA), Lesotho's currency is tied at
parity with the South African rand. Given the openness of the Lesotho
economy and the lack of exchange rate flexibility, the scope for conducting
independent monetary policy is very limited. Fiscal policy is therefore
the primary means available to the Government to control domestic
absorption, while the rate of inflation closely follows price developments
in South Africa. Lesotho is not a debt-distressed country. In 1990/91,
debt service was only 5.0 percent of exports of goods and services.
3.       The links between Lesotho and South Africa have been extended
through a bilateral treaty that will enable Lesotho to export its only
plentiful natural resource -- water -- to the industrial Transvaal. The
Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) will create an extensive system of
dams and tunnels, to be constructed under a Bank-assisted project; a 70 MW
hydropower station will be included. The financing requirement of the
water transfer and hydroelectric power components is estimated at
approximately $2.2 billion and $0.24 billion, respectively, over the period
1988 to 1997 at 1989 prices. The funding for the water transfer component
is expected to come from commercial sources, and will be repaid and
serviced by South Africa, while the Government of Lesotho is arranging
concessional and grant funding for the hydroelectric power component. The
scheme will create substantial benefits for Lesotho, with water royalties
and customs union rebates expected to equal about $900 million net present
value (1989 prices), as well as providing the stimulus for spin-off
enterprises.
4.       While developing this profitable long-term link with South Africa,
Lesotho is vulnerable elsewhere in its relationship with its neighbor;
notably, the diminishing profitability of the South African gold mining



- 2 -
Industry, and strong employment pressures in the republic, threaten the job
security of many of the Basotho migrant workers. The prospect of
escalating revenues mnd a changing relationship with South Africa
highlights the importance to Lesotho of effective macroeconomic planning
and budgetary management, and the need to be strategically prepared for the
geopolitical fallout.
5.       Economic management has suffered seriously from the lack of a
system for prioritizing and monitoring public expenditures. Delays in
financial reporting, weak budgetary control in the infrastructure
ministries, and virtually non-existent linkages between the development
plan and annual expenditure allocations contributed to a serious escalation
of the fiscal deficit during the late 1980s.
6.       Although Lesotho has achieved robust economic growth in the past
five years, with average real GDP increasing eight percent annually, the
country faces a number of serious structural problems, namely: (a)
inefficient and inequitable use of communal land, contributing to serious
environmental degradation; (b) lack of an enabling environment for economic
diversification to help address a growing unemployment problem and reduce
dependence on mine labor in South Africa; and (c) low implementation
capacity and a marked decline in the quality of education at a time of
expanding employment opportunity. The traditional land-allocation system,
dominated by the chiefs, has failed to regulate livestock overgrazing and
has supported inequitable distribution of grazing rights. Land-use
regulations have protected inefficient or absentee farmers, while ignoring
the tenurial security of women, who run many of the farms in the absence of
the menfolk in South Africa. Arable production has overemphasized food
self-sufficiency at the expense of higher-value crops, which were once
successfully produced in Lesotho. In education, Lesotho has traditionally
enjoyed high literacy rates compared with other sub-Saharan countries,
especially among women, making effective use of a comprehensive network of
church-linked schools. However, high enrollment growth has not been
matched by quality control and development and maintenance of
infrastructure; as a result, overcrowded classes are taught by
underqualified teachers, with high repeater and drop-out rates. In the
parastatal sector, poor management and high subsidies result in a budgetary
drain of about $10 million a year. These factors contributed to
substantial deterioration in the external current account and overall
balance of payments in the mid-1980s. The fiscal deficit (including
grants) reached an estimated 19.8 percent of GDP (10.4 percent of GNP) in
1987188.
7.       To address this situation, the Government, in collaboration with
the World Bank and the IMF, has designed a program of macroeconomic and
sectoral reforms. A major objective of the program is to sustain domestic
growth and increase employment, while strengthening the economy's fiscal
and external current account po ttion. Government strategy seeks to
mxzimize benefits from an expanding and changing relationship with South
Africa while doing more to develop new markets (e.g. the EEC) and deal with
the structural weaknesses that inhibit diversification of exports.
Manpower development is seen as an essential underpinning of these
objectives. The Government has also begun the politically-sensitive



- 5 -
openly declared their support for population control, and the Government
has begun to formulate a population policy.
14.      In the meantime, however, Lesotho faces a growing imbalance
between the growth in its labor force and its capacity to provide
productive employment. Although LHWP will be an important source of
employment, with the workforce reaching some 8,500 to 10,000 when
construction peaks, the Government has given priority to the preparation of
an industrial sector strategy, which is being supported by an ongoing IDA-
financed Industrial and Agroindustries Project. The strategy aims to
attract more foreign investment, do more to help Basotho entrepreneurs take
advantage of the liquidity in the banking system by developing bankable
projects, and deepen non-bank financial instruments for providing venture
capital.
15.      Education is another key element of the program, which is
described in Section II.
16.      Poverty Alleviation.  The Government's anti-poverty program is
being carried out on two fronts: (i) through positive measures for
increasing per capita incomes; and (ii) through safeguards targeted at
vulnerable groups. The PPP program, and the relatively high economic
growth achieved in recent years, has had a generally favorable impact on
standards of living. This has been complemented by the expansion of
Government programs for family planning, improved health-care provision in
remote areas, and special, permanent programs for tuberculosis, sexually-
transmitted disease and mother and child care. However, malnutrition is
prevalent among rural dwellers who lack both land and access to migrant
remittances, and the Government has agreed with donors to restructure its
food relief program to achieve better targeting. Safeguards are being
provided to low-income groups in the cost-recovery measures being taken by
the Government in health care, while a broad spectrum of tax increases
esempts basic foodstuffs.
17.      Economic Prospects.  Under the Fourth PFP, the target for real GDP
growth is set at an annual average of 7.6 percent over the period 1991/92
through 1993/94, while gross investment as a share of GNP is targeted at an
average of 53 percent over the same period, of which LHWP investment would
comprise 21 percent. Similarly, national savings are targeted at an
average of 50 percent of GNP. This reflects the substantial transfers to
Lesotho associated with the financing of the water-transfer component of
the LHWP. To consolidate the improvements in the external position, and to
achieve a more comfortable level of foreign exchange reserves, the fiscal
deficit as a proportion of GDP is targeted to fall from an estimated 2.2
percent (1.2 percent of GNP) in 1990191 to a surplus of 0.3 percent (0.2
percent of GNP) in 1993/94. The external current account deficit
(including unrequited transfers, and those associated with the LHWP) is
projected to fall to about 3 percent of GNP by 1993194. The main risk is
that, given declining profits in gold mining in South Africa, and strong
internal employment pressures, there will be a significant repatriation of
Basotho miners with an associated fall in miners' remittances below those
projected. To maintain a satisfactory external position in such an event,
public spending would have to be cut to levels substantially below those



- 6 -
targeted, with potentially adverse effects upon both public sector
efficiency and the social sectors, while domestic unemployment would be
exacerbated by the return of migrant mineworkers.
Bsnk Group Operations
18.      Bank strategy is closely identified with the objectives of the
Government's program, and has three main points of focuss (a) sustaining
the recent improvement in the fiscal situation, while strengthening long-
term economic management; (b) addressing structural pr-blems in the key
sectors; and (c) maximizing the economic opportunities of LHW, and
generally helping the Government prepare and implement a long-term strategy
to deal with the geopolitical changes taking place. These objectives are
supported by the Policy Framework Paper, a comprehensive technical
assistance operation by UNDP and the Bank to improve public sector
management, policy-oriented sector lending by IDA, and Bank economic and
sector work. Since 1986, the Government-Bank dialogue has intensified, as
the Lesotho authorities took on a daunting agenda of policy reform
following years of inaction. A new military government installed in April
1991 has reaffirmed its commitment to the reform program, and has made
arrangements for registration of voters prior to national elections
sched,led for June 1992. A significant part of the ongoing democratization
process is the granting of greater powers to elected village development
councils in the allocation and protection of land. An ongoing IDA-assisted
project will help these communities prepare and implement their own land-
use plans. Other policy issues on the Government's agenda includes (a) the
array of measures to stimulate industrial development, including
privatization of agro-industrial parastatals; (b) reform of land
legislation to encourage greater equity and efficiency in agriculture,
especially in regard to women; (c) further improvement of budget
management, building on recent successes; (d) long-term reform of the civil
service; and (e) achieving a consensus on population policy.
19       Composition of Lending Through FY90.   Since 1966, IDA has
provided Lesotho with credits totaling $180 million for 19 projects. Some
$47 million, or almost 26 percent of total assistance, has been for human
resource development. Lending for roads amounted to $34.6 million (19
percent), for agriculture and land management $27.6 million (19 percent),
and for urban development $26.4 million (15 percent), and for industrial
development $27.5 million (15 percent). Other credits have provided
resources for water supply, and for the engineering and technical
assistance necessary for preparing LHWP. Lending for infrastructure and
basic services dominated lending for the first 17 years; more recently,
projects have supported sectoral policy reforms (e.g. in land management
and housing finance) and addressed previously neglected areas such as
family planning and social sector financial management and cost-recovery.
With the exception of the LHWP engineering credit, implementation of IDA-
assisted projects has been subject to delays. These have been caused
mainly by capacity constraints, despite the provision of technical
assistance and training in projects. Several current donor initiatives are
addressing the capacity problem, as well as the proposed IDA-supported
project (Section II) and intensive technical assistance by the Bank, UNDP
and donors.



20.      Through the IDA-financed Industries and Agroindustries Project
(PY91), the Bank is supportir3 Government policies that focus on production
with an export orientation -- e.g. textiles and garments, footwear,
processed wool, and mohair production -- as well as industries and services
stimulated by the LHWP construction. Emphasis will be placed upon
developing the activities of two nascent institutionst the Lesotho
Investment Promotion Center (LIPC) and the Business Advisory Promotion
Services (RAPS). These institutions offer support to foreign investors and
indigenous entrepreneurs, respectively. The LIPC will have a technical
assistance agreement with an experienced investment promotion organization,
and training will be provided in investment promotion techniques and
management. The BAPS will receive similar support and staff training, and
will develop a comprehensive data base regarding the resource requirements
of activities relating to the LHWP, large-scale companies, and the LIPC.
To further encourage industrial development, and to improve the environment
within which these two institutions will operate, the Government will
maintain newly-adopted policies ofs (a) streamlining work permit
processing; (b) increasing land availability for industrial developments
and (c) regularly reassessing the level of both the sales tax on public
utilities and the minimum wage to reduce the impact of large unanticipated
increases in labor and other costs, and to protect Lesotho's competitive
position in the region. An equity fund administered by the Lesotho
National Development Corporation (LNDC) will offer significant
encouragement to the development of small-scale industry. The Basotho
Enterprises Development Corporation (BEDCO) has ceased its lending
operations, but will continue to provide industrial and workshop space, and
will assist entrepreneurs in preparing bankable projects. A six-year
investment plan has been initiated rec3ntly by the Lesotho Electricity
Corporation (LEC), which will permit a substantial expansion in power
connections to industrial premises. Future investments in
telecommunications infrastructure will also support industrial investment.
21.      The Bank, with donors, is supporting a major expansion of the
Government's population and health program. A first IDA-funded population
and health project (FY85) successfully established a TB control program,
upgraded clinics, and created a system for developing manpower in the
sector. It also introduced basic family planning program into the health-
delivery system, while emphasizing safe motherhood and reduced infant
mortality. Most of the goals were achieved, althcgh the family planning
program lagged behind mainly because of inadequate consultation with
communities. A second project (FY90) is helping to train far greater
numbers of health and family planning workers at clinic and community
level, and aims to exploit the high levels of female literacy and good
communications channels through expanded information and education
programs. The project will learn from the experience of the first project,
and enhance the role of local communities, church NGOs and the private
medical system in health-care delivery and family planning.
22.      Future Lending.  Lending during the FY92-95 period will be
dominated by the Lesotho Highlands iater Project, for which a $110 million
IBRD enclave loan is proposed. Most of the funding will come from
commercial sources; the Bank's financing will be directed towards
construction supervision and the continued institutional development of the



- 8 -
specially-created Lesotno Highlands Development Authority (LHDA). Bank
finance will help LHDA implement comprehensive programs for limiting the
environmental impact of the project, and providing compensation and rural
development support for affected communities.
23.      IDA lending, whtch is constrained by Lesotho's small slize, will
give the highest priority to arresting the decline in the quality of
education. A Bank education sector study recommended a series of actions
required to improve quality of instruction and student achievement and
begin to address sectoral management and financing issues. The Government
and Bank have concluded discussions on how these goals can be supported
through the IDA-supported project proposed in this report, which would be
coordinated with assistance f-om donors (Section II).
24.      In the infrastructure sectors, a Bank Public Expenditure Review
faulted the Government for promoting new construction at the expense of
maintenance. In particular, agricultural marketing and rural development
is constrained by the frequently impassable condition of mountain roads,
while roads constructed with IDA assistance in the late 1960s and the 19708
are in need of repair or rehabilitation. Infrastructure maintenance is
included in the IDA lending program, subject to the outcome of a proposed
study that will prepare an inventory on the maintcnance needs of roads and
other infrastructure (e.g. bridges, mountain airstrips), while recommending
long-term strengthening of maintenance services. The study will be linked
to the Government's PFP-related effort to prioritize capital expenditure
and give special emphasis to maintenance.
25.      Future IDA lending to the productive sectors will be determined by
progress with the ongoing land management project, the outcome of proposed
agricultural sector work, and Government effectiveness in implementing the
ongoing industrial strategy, and a proposed energy review.
26.      As a contingency measure, the Bank would respond to any large-
scale and sudden return of migrant miners by readjusting the IDA lending
program to give greater emphasis -- possibly within the framework of an
ongoing health project -- to social welfare, particularly nutritional
programs. It would be crucial in such circumstances for the Government to
maintain momentum in its program for increasing employment through economic
diversification and the creation of skills.
27,      No IDA adjustment lending is envisaged for Lesotho.  The ongoing
PFP/SAP/ESAF program has been effective in preparing a comprehensive agenda
of policy reform, backed by investment and technical assistance projects
which support Government initiatives in sector adjustment.
28.      Technical Assistance.  The Bank's technical assistance has been
provided through a number of vehicles (e.g. SPPFs and Bank-executed
projects funded by the UN and donors), and has been specifically designed
to support the objectives of the PFP. There has been early success in a
coordinated effort by SIDA, ODA the Bank and Fund in strengthening
budgetary management and accounting; an effective pilot program introduced
in key ministries is gradually being extended throughout the bureaucracy,
with extensive retraining of personnel. A Bank SPPF has proposed a phased



process of land reform, environmental protection and reduction of
population growth.
8.       The specific policy measures and strategies were first set out in
a Policy Framework Paper (PFP) for 1988/89 to 1990/91, and have been
reaffirmed and extended in three subsequent PFPc which have received the
support of the Fund through a SAP and ESAF. The main components of the
program are: (a) measures designed both to restrain government expenditure
growth and raise additional revenue; (b) initiatives aimed at raising the
efficiency of the civil service, strengthening the planning process, and
improving budgetary management; (c) reform of the land tenure system and
improvements in range management; and (d) policy reforms in the industrial
and agro-industrial sectors to stimulate employment, private investment and
savings, improve parastatal efficiency, and encourage privatization.
Recent Performance and Future Policies
9.       Lesotho's performaace was mixed over the firsc two years of the
PFP program. While growth performance was encouraging, with an estimated
average growth rate in real GDP over the two years of 8.3 percent,
implementation of the reform program during the first year, 1988/89, was
disappointing, with major slippages in the implementst',qn of expenditure
control and revenue-raising measures, and consequently little improvement
in the exter-nal position. In 1989/90, the situation was substantially
reversed, as the Government implemented appropriate revenue-raising
measures and, more importantly, introduced and substantially strengthened a
number of expenditure controls. Provisional estimates indicate that, given
both the implementation of revenue-raising measures and restraints upon
expenditure growth, the fiscal deficit fell to 4.5 percent of GNP during
1989190 and is expected to narrow to 1.2 of GNP in 1990/91. The external
current account deficit improved correspondingly from 7.6 percent of GNP in
1988/89 to an estimated 5.2 percent of GNP in 1989/90 and is expected to be
reduced to 3.3 percent of GNP in 1990/91, compared with a growth rate of
real GNP of 2.3 percent.

10.      Under the structural adjustment program, the Government has also
taken a number of steps to encourage both domestic savings and investment.
The domestic prime lending rate and the minimum savings deposit rate have
been regularly adjusted according to interest rate developments in South
Africa, with a conv2rgence to South African levels. The export financing
scheme, first launched in October 1988, has been maintained as a means of
increasing the flow of credit to productive industrial investment and
exports. Tax exemption on income from treasury bills has been abolished,
thus increasing the relative attractiveaess of lending to the private
sector. agricultural production and exports are expected to increase as a
result of the introduction of a revolving fund, financed by the United
Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), to provide short and long-term
credit to farmers through the commercial banks.
11.      Under the PFP, the Government is coordinating its efforts with the
Bank, UNDP and bilateral donors to support a program to reform
macroeconomic management and the budgetary process and restructure the
civil service. As part of the program, the function of para 'atals will be
reassessed, privatization encouraged where appropriate, and future
performance monitored. Substantial progress has already been achieved in
budgetary and personnel management and in the provision of management
training to civil servants. A new budget management system recently
introduced in key ministries contributed to the reduction of government
expenditures; with strong donor and Bank assistance, the Government is
planving an expansion of the system to other ministries, while adapting it
to cover capital expenditures. To ensure effective and equitable use of
Highlands Water revenues, the Government is in the process of creating a
special development fund.
12.      In other areas, progress has been slower.  in agriculture, the aim
is to improve productivity and quality, and in turn provide the basis for
the creation of agro-industrial and other non-farm employment. In
particular, farmers are being encouraged to exploit Lesotho's potential for
the production of high-value crops, in which there has been some
demonstrated success (e.g. asparagus, melons and vegetables). Overgrazing
is to be reduced through both the maintenance and expansion of a number of
existing programs and the introduction of grazing fees in selected areas.
There have been delays in implementing important proposals for land reform,
which include the extension of land-use rights to women and measures to
promote informal leasing arrangements; however the Government has begun a
process of democratization which will enable village communities to play a
greater role in land allocation ana conservation.
13.      The Government's proposals for land reform and improved
agricultural productivity will generally be favorable to the environment.
They are being consolidated in a national environmental action plan,
adopted by the Governmunt in 1989, which identifies the country's main
environmental problems, and calls for more effective use of ongoing
assistance programs before any new investments are embarked upon. To
implement the plan, the Government intends to establish a supervising body
to coordinate the environmental initiatives of sectoral ministries. The
link between population and the environment is strong in Lesotho, given the
limited carrying capacity of the land. Recently, the country's leaders



- 9 -
program for achieving this. In a complementary action, the Bank is working
with the EEC in helping the Government create a special development fund to
ensure that LHWP reverAes are used effectively and equitably. In the
broader field of civil service reform, the Bank joined a group of UN
agencies in preparing a comprehensive project for restructuring the civil
service and provide training to match. We expect to remain closely
associated with the program. The Bank took a leading role in helping the
Government prepare its Environmental Action Plan, which was adopted in
1989. We are continuing to provide substantial support to the Government
in setting up the administrative machinery for implementing the plan.  The
Government has accepted a Bank proposal for training village development
councils to implement simple technologies for sustainable agriculture; this
effort will be complemented by recent legislation clarifying the role of
the councils, and by the ongoing IDA-assisted land management project.
29.      Economic and Sector Work.  Bank economic and sector work helped
provide the basis for the Government's reform program. A Bank agricultural
review in 1985 focussed attention on the potential for high-value crops; a
1986 public sector management study was the genesis for present plans to
reform the civil service; the Country Economic Memorandum of 1988
highlighted the vulnerability of Lesotho's dependence on South African gold
mining, urged greater diversification of the domestic economy, and drew
attention to the need for Lesotho's labor force to be ready to adjust to
changing opportunities in South Africa.  A recent Bank education sector
review formed the basis for the proposed IDA assistance to the sector. In
industry and agro-industry, a wide range of studies and strategy
formulations prepared the ground for the recently-approved Industrial and
Agroindustries Project.
30.      During FY92-93, we are planning an economic update to assess the
impact of the Government's PFP-linked rteorm program, and recommend follow-
up actions. In agriculture, our strategy is to increase the value added
within sustainable limits. We support the Government's policy for expanded
production  f high-value crops, given significant levels of imports of such
crops, the prospect for export to Europe and South Africa, and the
advantages for maximizing the value added from Lesotho's very limited
cultivable land. Through our ESW, we expect to help Lesotho assess its
experience in horticulture, and recommend ways of improving research,
extension, marketing and enterprise promotion in the subsector.   Family
planning support is provided by the Government, but a concerted effort to
reduce fertility has not yet been possible largely because of the
resistance of the churches, through which more than half of the country's
primary health care is delivered. In recent years the country's leaders
have openly declared their support for a population policy, and the
Government has begun to formulate one. The Bank will support this effort
through a Population Policy Review. In the context of LHEWP, we have helped
the Government deal with institutional weaknesses in the power sector,
which must prepare itself for dealing with greatly increased transmission
when the LHWP hydropower component is complete. Our past technical
assistance to the sector will be supplemented in the near future through
our ESW program. A Women in Development Assessment is also planned, given
the crucial role that women play in farming, social services and small-
scale business.

31.      IMF and Aid Coordination.  Bank relations with the IMF have been
close and constructive during the PFP/SAF process. The UNDP Donor
Roundtable for Lesotho was revived at the Government's request in 1988
after a lapse of several years, during which donor interaction had been ad
hoc and increasingly ineffectual. The Roundtable's opening conference has
been followed by an ongoing series of smaller working groups organized on a
sectoral basis. Bank documents have formed the basis for a number of
meetings. The Policy Framework Paper has helped to serve as a medium-term
agenda for assistance coordination, while LHWP has intensified coordination
among interested donors. Widespread donor interest in the environment and
public-sector management threatens to create problems of overlap and
conflict of goals; thus special donor workshops in these sectors are
planned.
32.      Sumzary Assessment.  Lesotho is at a crucial juncture in its
economic development, facing unprecedented opportunities and risks. The
proposed Highlands Water Project, and subsequent phases of the scheme,
represent one of the largest infrastructure investments to be made in sub-
Saharan Africa. The project will enable Lesotho to export its only
plentiful natural resource -- water -- and benefit from substantial
revenues and spin-off activities. But while developing this profitable
long-term link with South Africa, Lesotho is vulnerable elsewhere in its
relationship with its neighbor. Notably, the diminishing returns of the
South African gold mining industry, and strong employment pressures in the
republic, threaten the job security of many of the 140,000 Basotho migrant
workers. Another risk is that Lesotho will not make the effective
developmental use of LHWP revenues, thus wafting the best opportunity it
has had to secure the economic future.
33.      These circumstances make it imperative for Lesotho to be
strategically prepared for the changing circumstances. The Government that
came to power in 1986 accepted the need for such an approach, and set
itself an agenda of adjustment and policy reform through the PFPISAF
process and through special initiatives such as an environmental action
plan and a program to strengthen public sector management and budgetary
control. The new Government has endorsed this program, and aims to: (i)
achieve effective fiscal discipline and prioritization of development goals
before major LHEP revenues begin to accrue; (ii) maximize the direct and
long-term indirect opportunities of LHWP; (iii) reduce its dependence on
South African mining by diversifying the domestic economy while seeking to
take advantage of changing employment opportunities in the neighboring
republic; and (iv) develop the human resources to maet these challenges,
giving particular urgency to reversing the decline in the quality of
education.
34.      The Government has made good progress towards achieving some of
these goals. A marked improvement in fiscal policy and management has
arrested the escalating budget deficit and has contributed to encouraging
GDP growth. Also the Government has worked constructively with the Bank
and donors in preparing an agenda of policy refomss and other measures to
help diversify the economy, encourage investors and develop new industrial
and agroindustrial markets, and put agriculture on an environmentally-
sustainable basis. The real test will be in implementation. Urgent action



- 11 -
is required to esecute the proposed land reform program, which is
prerequisite to sustainable agriculture; while the potential for high-value
crops will be realized only with improvements to the marketing
infrastructure and enhanced support for agribusiness. The Government must
also build on the encouraging progress in improving fiscal management by
addressing serious weaknesses in long-term economJc planning, as well as
improve civil service performance.
35.      The Bank's assistance program has been closely identified with the
reform program, both in its preparatory phase and in helping to implement
specific objectives. While the Highlands Water Project dominates our
lending for the next five years, our program in general aims to provide a
sound macroeconomic framework for maximizing the benefits of LHiP to
Lesotho and helping the country deal with the changing geopolitical risks
and opportunities.
II. The Proposed Credit
36.      The proposed credit of SDR 18.9 million (US$25.2 million
equivalent) would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would
help finance an education sector development project. The project would be
financed on a parallel basis by the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the European Community (EC) for approximately
US$29.1 million.
Sector Background-and Project Contest
37.      Over the past decade, Lesotho has successfully established a
comprehensive, broad-based education system, spanning early childhood to
university levels. Today, Lesotho's gross primary and secondary
enrollments are about 116 percent and 24 percent respectively, among the
highest in Africa. Also, uniquely in the Africa region, girls actually
outnumber boys (who are expected to herd livestock and/or work in the
mines) at all levels of the education system; the ratio of girls to boys in
primary schools is 1.2sl and as high as 1.5:1 at secondary and post-
secondary levels.
38.      Despite these achievements (and in part because of the rapid rate
at which enrollments grew), Lesotho enters the 19909 faced with a serious
problem of low and deteriorating quality of education. This is reflected
in poor test results and high rates of drop-out/repetition, with negative
implications for the efficiency of resource use. Underlying this situation
are: (a) weak sectoral management capacity, including failure to clearly
define and implement the respective responsibilities of the Ministry of
Education (MOE), parents, and church missions which own and operate over
902 of schools; (b) insufficient public resource allocations to the sector
exacerbated by severe skewing of resources, with basic education severely
underfunded relative to tertiary; and (c) long-standing neglect of
conditions of service for teachers and associated issues of adequate
managerial and professional support. Combined, these problems have led to:
extremely high pupil:teacher and pupiltclassroom ratios, low teacher
morale, and inadequate instructional materials/curricula at primary level;



- 12 -
the proliferation of small, uneconomic secondary schools coupled with low
quality of instruction; uneven formal vocational education and a failure to
exploit opportunities for cooperation with employers in developing skilled
manpower; a weak university government and high overheads; and,
underutilization of existing capacity for non-formal education.
39.      PCRs and PPARs for the first three Bank-supported education
projects and review of the fourth project (which will close in 9/1991)
indicated that while the projects' relatively narrowly-defined objectives
had been substantially achieved, there had been inadequate attention paid
to the underlying structural issues described in para 38. Comprehensive
sector work was therefore undertaken in 1988189 to analyze constraints to
sectoral effectiveness, and, together with other Bank education policy
studies and donor and Government analyses, formed the basis for dialogue
with Government concerning sectoral aims and the objectives and composition
of education sector development activities. Subsequently, Government, with
IDA assistance, developed a coherent strategy and reform package comprising
policy revisions, an action program and public expenditure plan to begin
addressing sectoral problems during the Fifth Plan period (91/92-95/96).
With regard to the structural issues identified, Government intends tot (a)
undertake a reorganization of the MOE to rationalize its central structure
as well as decentralize MOE activities; (b) implement a number of measures
to establish an explicitly contractual relationship in education between
the MOE and church missions; (c) substantially increase public recurrent
resource allocations to education in real terms; (d) allocate a minimum of
702 of the incremental resources to primary education while constraining
expenditures at the university; and (e) raise teachers' salaries to a level
comparable with other civil servants, improve incentives for service in
hardship posts, establish clear management lines and strengthen inservice
training and other professional support. In addition, direct interventions
to improve the quality and efficiency of education will also be Implemented
through a combination of new investments and policy measures, focusing on
the needs at primary level, and building on initiatives already begun with
assistance from IDA, USAID, EC, ODA, Ireland and Germany. While most
attention will be paid to primary edncation (including teacher training),
investments in the other subsectors are also foreseen to respond to
identified priority issues.
The Proiect
40.      Project Obiectives.  The main objective of the project is to
assist Government in the implementation of its five-year action plan for
sectoral reform in education, as laid out in a letter of development policy
and detailed matrix of specific objectives and actions. Project support
would focus ons (a) supporting investments aimed at increasing the quality,
efficiency and relevance of educational programs at all levels of the
education system, with a special focus on primary education, and (b)
helping to address the key management, financing and resource allocation,
and staffing issues which constrain overall sectoral performance.
45.      Project Description.  Within the framework of Government's
policy/action matrix and investment plan, the project will support
improvements ins (a) primary, by constructing/furnishing additional



- 13 -
classrooms in three phases beginning with the relatively-neglected
highlands and ending with Maseru and other lowlands areas, increasing
instructional materials, rationalizing the curriculum, improving pupil
assessment (both continuous assessment and the public examinations),
recruiting additional teachers to prevent deterioration of already high
pupiliteacher ratios, and supporting policies to directly increase internal
efficiency by limiting enrollments of over- and under-age pupils and
reducing repetitiont
(b) secondary, by supporting efforts to rationalize allocation of public
resources to uneconomic schools and regulate opening of new ones, improving
student assessment, and improving teaching by support to teachers in the
form of teachers' guides and in-service refresher training; (c) teacher
training, by expanding the output and quality of both the pre- and in-
service teacher training programs and providing management support to the
teacher college; (d) technical and vocational education (TVE) by raising
the quality and cost-effectiveness of fetmal pre-service TVE through
support for standardization of curricula at craft level and introduction of
evening classes at selected institutions and encouraging involvement of
employers in TVE through expansion of trade-testing capacity and policy
studies; and (e) university, by assisting in implementation of cost-
containment measures in non-teaching areas, introduction of a more coherent
academic program, improvement of science and library facilities and support
for faculty research.
46.      Project support for improvements in sectoral management will focus
on establishing a twinning arrangement between the OE and a suitable
counterpart institution abroad and establishment of a monitoring and
evaluation system, including provision of TA and training attachments. In
addition, office equipment for automation of MOE operations,
construction/equipping of district MOE offices, operating costs and
salaries for agreed new posts would be included under the project.
Management training for headteachers would be supported through the project
to improve school-level management. Project conditionality is the main
vehicle for addressing issues of teachers' conditions of service and issues
of sectoral financing, which are critical to ensuring the productivity and
sustainability of project investments.
47.      Agreed Actions.  Prior to negotiations Government approvedt (a) a
satisfactory teaching service salary scale and career structure; (b) the
agreed MOE reorganization plan, including decentralization measures; and
(c) the agreed five-year education action plan. A signed letter of
education sector development policy has been received by IDA subsequent to
negotiations. The following are conditions of credit effectIveness: (a)
enactment of a revised Education Order clarifying roles of Government,
churches and parents and reinforcing MOE authority over teachers and
opening/closing of schools; (b) enactment of a revised University Order and
Statutes rationalizing university administration; and (c) execution of the
grant agreement between USAID and Government for the USAID parallel-
financed activities.
48.      With regard to actions during the project's implementation period,
Government has confirmed that it will implement the 5-year action plan
agreed with IDA as set out in a letter of development policy, including the



- 14 -
following specific actions: (a) recurrent resource allocations to education
would be increased by 54.4 percent in real terms between 1990/91 and
1991/92 and by at least 4.0 percent in real terms during each subsequent
year of the Fifth Plan period; (b) independent evaluations of the
vocational and agriculture programs in secondary and primary schools
respectively would be undertaken by 3/93 and their recomendations
implemented by 9/94; (c) 1300 new primary teachers would be recruited
during the Plan period, with 70? of these allocated to lower primary; (d)
evening classes would be introduced in 12 TVE institutions by 3193; and (e)
Government would conduct, jointly with IDA, two project implementation
reviews in 3/93 and 9/94 respectively. Conditions of disbursement are as
followss (a) disbursements for the second phase of construction of school
clas&rooms is conditional on public announcement of agreed policy changes
related to primary attendance by under- and over-age children, repetition
limits, and allocation of teaching posts to secondary school in accordance
with a 25sl minimum studentsteacher ratio; (b) disbursement of funds for
other classrooms (in the lowlands) is conditional on implementation of
these announced policy measures; (c) construction of the trade-testing
center is conditional on the completion of a feasibility study on the
financial aspects of operating the center; and (d) laboratory construction
at the university is conditional on completion of the conversion to a
subject system or modified unit course system, implementation of agreed
cost containment measures, and completion of a study of university
overheads.
IDA Role and Benefits and Risks
49.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's country assistance strategy,
articulated in the recent CSP, stresses development of a well-educated,
skilled labor force as a high priority for achieving long-term economic
growth in natural resource-poor Lesotho. Having played an important role
in helping the country to increase access to basic education, IDA's
involvement is now regarded as important by both the Government and donors
in helping the MOE to strengthen education planning and monitoring,
rationalize spending and achieve needed quality and management
improvements.
50.      Benefits and Risks.  The project would assist in improving the
quality of the educational system, helping to increase student achievement
and maintain/improve Basotho productivity and competitiveness in the
domestic and regional labor markets. In the medium- to longer-run,
therefore, it should help raise household incomes, thus contributing to
Government's poverty alleviation efforts. Through support for revision in
education policy and resource allocation patterns, the project would also
help establish a sound base for future investments. Finally, the project's
focus on development of a coherent sectoral plan would help achieve much-
needed improvements in donor coordination within the sector. The project's
principal risk is that with the coming of elections in 1992, political
candidates may promise further sectoral expansion, despite the need for,
and current Governmental commitment to, consolidation during the Fifth Plan
period. To reduce this risk, the project would finance a well-targeted
public awareness campaign to increase popular appreciation of efficiency
issues. A second risk is that Government, given its fiscal austerity



- 15 -
program, may not increase education budgetary allocations enough to allow
timely implementation of the reform package. This risk is reduced by the
strong support for continued real growth in education spending articulated
in the Government's Policy Framework Papers as well as public
pronouncements stating strong commitment to education.
Recommendation
51.      I am satisfied that the proposed credit vould comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
