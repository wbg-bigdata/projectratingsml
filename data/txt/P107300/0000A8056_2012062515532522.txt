                         The development objective of the proposed project is to support the Government of Sindh's Medium Term Education Sector Reform Program (SERP). The objectives of
                         SERP are to increase school participation, reduce gender and rural-urban disparities, increase progression and improve the measurement of student learning.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Sindh Education Sector Project (SEP) was approved by the Board on June 4, 2009 and became effective on June 11, 2009. The total credit amount is USD300 million. The
                         project is presently slated to close on June 30, 2012. The project is mainly performance based with annual implementation progress/performance targets (Disbursement Linked
                         Indicators or DLIs) in 10 subprograms/activities, against which project disbursements are made.

                         The Additional Financing for the Sindh Education Sector Project (SEP AF) for US$50 million was approved by the Board on March 24, 2011 and signed by the government on May
                         19, 2011. The Project Development Objective (PDO) -- including the PDO-level indicators--under SEP AF are identical to those of SEP. The AF supports the implementation of three

                         posts to schools; (2) preparation and management of school-specific non-salary budgets; and (3) extension of the district Education Management Reform (EMR) initiative to additional
                         districts.

                         All ten (10) of the FY2008/09 DLIs in SEP were satisfactorily met by the Government of Sindh, including the Global DLI on merit and needs based teacher recruitment.

                         All ten (10) of the FY2009/10 DLIs in SEP were satisfactorily met by the Government of Sindh, including the Global DLI on merit and needs based teacher recruitment. The
                         achievement of two DLIs -- fiscal and budget management and school management committees -- had lagged beyond FY2009/10 but were subsequently satisfactorily met in
                         FY2010/11.

                         All ten (10) of the FY2010/11 DLIs in SEP were satisfactorily met by the Government of Sindh, including the Global DLI on merit and needs based teacher recruitment. The
                         achievement of 2.5 DLIs -- fiscal and budget management (1); Annual School Census (0.5); and the public-private partnership program under the Sindh Education Foundation (1)--
                         had lagged beyond FY2010/11 but were satisfactorily met in FY2011/12. In the case of the Annual School Census DLI, remedial actions were taken by the Government in
                         FY2011/12, to improve the Annual School Census data quality for the 2011/12 round.

                         All three (3) of the DLIs for SEP AF were satisfactorily met by the Government of Sindh.

                         The Government has fully or partially (in agreement with the Bank) met time-bound legal covenants and maintains full compliance with recurrent legal covenants under SEP and SEP
                         AF.

                         With respect to SEP, including the disbursement recently authorized (June 7, 2012), a sum of roughly US$300 million has been disbursed. With respect to SEP AF, the full US$50
                         million has been disbursed. The TA component under SEP (original amount of US$6 million equivalent) has an underspend due to other Development Partners picking up activities
                         originally envisaged for Bank TA support and the Government of Sindh also putting its own resources for key TA activities.

                         Meeting the DLIs have contributed to improving (1) fiscal sustainability and the effectiveness of public education expenditures, (2) education sector management; (3) access to quality
                         schooling in rural areas and for girls; and (4) the quality of teaching and student learning. Impacts at the service delivery level arise from several interventions, including (1) supporting
                         the setup and operation of public-private partnership schools in un/underserved rural communities; (2) teacher recruitment that is merit based (test based) and the local placement of
                         teachers in needy schools (understaffed schools) under fixed-term, school-specific contracts; (3) the rehabilitation of schools at record pace combined with careful independent
                         screening, full completion, and adherence to minimum construction quality standards; and (4) the activation of and provision of grants to school management committees (parent-
                         teacher associations) across the province, including the rollout of a capacity building initiative for school management committees.
