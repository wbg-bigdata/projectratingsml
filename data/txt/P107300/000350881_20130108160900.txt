1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1 At the time of preparation of the Sindh Education Sector Project (SEP), Pakistan’s
economic growth had slowed down to below 4% owing to major external and internal shocks,
after having experienced a remarkable turnaround since 2000 in part as an outcome of
Government initiated reforms, as articulated in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-I,
2003). Despite the economic progress, social indicators were low and compared poorly with
those of other countries with similar levels of per capita income. The country was off track in
meeting the education Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for 2015, which are universal
primary completion and gender parity in enrollment.

1.1.2 Sindh, Pakistan’s second largest province in terms of both population and economic
output, performed poorly across a range of socioeconomic indicators despite its strong relative
economic position and growth performance. The incidence of household poverty, especially in
rural Sindh, was high (31% in 2005/06) and the rural population was among the most vulnerable
to falling into poverty. About half the children of the primary school population were enrolled in
school. The net enrollment rate (NER) for rural girls in primary school (ages 5-9 years, grades 1-
5) was 31% in 2006/07, and only about one half of rural girls stayed enrolled for some middle or
secondary education after completing primary schooling. Lastly, the level of student achievement
in the province, as in the rest of the country, was low.

1.1.3 Major sector issues affecting the performance of public education system and causing
poor outcomes in Sindh were: (i) insufficient and inefficient budgetary processes; (ii) minimal
monitoring, supervision and accountability of service delivery agents; (iii) limited parent and
community oversight of and participation in school level management and decision-making; (iv)
ineffective implementation of demand side programs such as secondary school stipends for girls
and the provision of free textbooks; (v) patronage-based public school teacher hiring, potentially
compromising the quality of in-coming teachers and their accountability; (vi) lack of teacher
standards and quality assurance in teacher education and professional development; and (vii)
limited extent and quality of evidence-based decision-making due to lack of timeliness and
quality of data from existing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems.

1.1.4 To address these challenges, the Government of Sindh (GoS) initiated a multi-faceted,
medium-term Education Sector Reform Program (SERP) in 2006/07. Reflecting an important
shift from previous development efforts which focused on the levels of expenditures, inputs and
benefits, SERP sought to improve access, equity and quality in education by (i) improving
governance and accountability in education service delivery, and (ii) combining education
reforms with fiscal and public finance management interventions to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of public expenditures.

1.1.5 The Bank supported the design and implementation of the first year of SERP through the
Sindh Education Sector Development Policy Credit (SEDPC) in June 2007. The Bank continued
to support the SERP through the Sindh Education Sector Project (SEP) and Additional Financing
(AF) for SEP, approved by the Board in June 2009 and March 2011, respectively (see Box 1).




                                                1
Box 1: SEP Instrument Design:
The SEP, along with a similar education project in Punjab, was the first results-based education sector
operation in IDA countries, with four key innovative design features:
     • The design was performance based with disbursements tied to pre-specified annual
          implementation progress and performance targets, referred to as Disbursement Linked Indicators
          (DLIs). The DLIs captured intermediate results, central to the medium-term achievement of the
          project development objectives.
     • The design was underpinned by education sector governance initiatives that attempted to set the
          structures and incentives right for service delivery performance.
     • The design also supported improvements in budget and fiscal management, financial management,
          procurement management, and environmental safeguard principles and practices. While the
          specific focus was on the education sector, benefits of many of these improvements extended
          beyond the education sector.
     • The design aimed at further strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems.
The design likely helped in orienting and focusing the GoS's efforts on agreed program implementation
progress and performance targets (see Section 2), and enabled the GoS to take forward important but
politically-difficult, governance-oriented reforms by providing the desired backing in the face of opposition
from status-quo proponents. Annual sets of DLIs also likely promoted steady, incremental progress, scale
up, and improvements in program implementation over the project's life.

1.1.6 Rationale for Bank Assistance: The SERP provided a sound and promising strategy for
improving educational outcomes in Sindh, helping the country make progress towards meeting
the education MDGs. The Bank was in a unique position to add considerable value, beyond
financing the expenditures, through the associated technical and global knowledge that underpins
the Bank’s guidance, and through the political support it leverages domestically for introducing
significant institutional changes.

1.1.7 Higher-level Objectives: At the time of approval, the Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS, 2006a) and the national priorities emphasized increased academic achievement of
primary-school students, reduction in gender gaps in school participation, and improvement in
access to and quality of secondary education. One key pillar of the Government’s PRSP II (2009)
was Human Development which emphasized (a) improving access to education for all, (b)
removing urban-rural and gender imbalances in school participation, (c) enhancing the quality of
education and student learning at all levels, and (d) improving governance and management of
the education sector. PRSP II also emphasized the need to increase financing for the sector,
strengthen planning and implementation capacity, improve resource utilization, enhance
governance for greater accountability of education providers to the community, build capacity of
district and local institutions, and strengthen the role of school committees, all of which are
central in SERP and the SEP.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
1.2.1 The development objective of the project was to support the SERP. The objectives of
SERP were to increase school participation, reduce gender and rural-urban disparities in school
participation, increase progression and improve the measurement of student learning.

1.2.2 The success in meeting the PDO was to be measured using the following four PDO level
outcome indicators and targets (page 5, PAD):

(i) NER in primary schools was expected to increase from 50.3% in 2006/07 to 55.6% in
2011/12;
(ii) female-male ratio NER in primary schools in rural Sindh was expected to increase from
61.2% in 2006/07 to 64.6% in 2011/12;




                                                     2
(iii) transition rate from class 5 to 6 for girls in rural public schools was expected to increase from
51.2% in 2007/08 to 63.4% in 2011/12, and
(iv) learning levels were expected to be monitored through diagnostic learning assessments.

The project was to also regularly monitor the achievement of the DLIs to measure success of the
program (see PAD, pages 36-38 and SEP AF PP, page 9). Although the PAD (page 35) included
other intermediate and outcome indicators, the project’s primary focus was on the four PDO level
indicators and the DLIs to measure the project’s success.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justifications
1.3.1 The PDO and the PDO level key indicators were not revised. However, in March 2011,
under the SEP AF, two additional DLIs were added and one of the original DLIs in the SEP was
expanded in scope (see paragraph 1.7.1). One key justification for the SEP AF was to support the
GoS’s commitment and effort in the design and early implementation of the selected key
education reform activities to improve school system management and service delivery
performance, in order to enhance the SEP’s effectiveness.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
1.4.1 All students in GoS primary and secondary schools and low-cost private schools that
were covered by the SEP initiatives were the immediate beneficiaries and targets of the project
(about 4.29 million children in 49,496 schools at appraisal). The other main beneficiaries were
the Education Department (ED), its Reform Support Unit (RSU), district and school level
management for service delivery, and parents and teachers. The initiatives taken together
covered the entire province, and also covered all levels (grades 1-10). Nine of the ten areas with
DLIs covered government schools, and two of the ten areas with DLIs covered the Sindh
Education Foundation’s (SEF’s) Promoting Private Schooling in Rural Sindh (PPRS) program, a
public-private partnership to extend service delivery to disadvantaged communities. Several
interventions in the SERP and SEP were to disproportionately generate larger performance gains
in rural areas and/or benefit girls (see paragraphs 2.4.6, 2.4.7, 3.2.3 and 3.2.8).

1.5 Original Components
1.5.1 The project consisted of two components: (1) Financing of SERP (cost at appraisal
US$2,166 million, IDA US$294 million); and (2) Technical Assistance (IDA US$6 million).

1.5.2 Component 1 (Financing of SERP) was to finance key eligible expenditure programs
(EEPs) in SERP, with disbursements based on achievements of agreed DLIs that reflect
implementation progress and performance targets, critical to achieving the PDO (see Annex 2).
SERP had four broad thrust areas:

I.      Improving fiscal sustainability and effectiveness of public education expenditures,
through: (i) improved budgetary processes to introduce medium-term, results based budgeting
through the preparation of Medium-Term Fiscal and Budget Frameworks (MTFF, MTBF); (ii)
enhanced internal controls and financial accountability through the resolution of audit paragraphs;
and (iii) improved procurement management. It included one DLI: DLI 1- Execution of
education budgets (including SERP expenditures) in alignment with the MTFF which integrates
SERP strategy and results.

II.     Improving education sector management, through reforms to (i) strengthen provincial
monitoring of education sector and evaluation of priority programs including the implementation
of the Annual School Census (ASC); (ii) strengthen district education management cadre; (iii)
improve performance of districts in school rehabilitation and education service delivery through
performance based funding partnerships; and (iv) strengthen School Management Committees’
(SMCs) capacity and effectiveness through the implementation of a pilot capacity building

                                                  3
program. It included four DLIs: (a) DLI 2 - Share of prioritized schools to meet stipulated design,
construction quality and functionality standards; (b) DLI 3 - Time taken to complete
administration of the ASC and share of schools with ASC data within 10% deviation from
validation data; (c) DLI 4 - Steps in the implementation of the new education management
structure and advice/support system in at least one taluka of two pilot districts; and (d) DLI 5 -
Share of public schools with active SMCs, and the number of schools supported by the SMC
capacity building pilot.

III.     Improving access to quality schooling particularly in rural areas and for girls,
through reforms to (i) improve the performance and effectiveness of GoS’s existing programs
(free textbooks program, and the secondary school girls’ stipend programs for attending public
schools and a phased-in introduction of the DSP (higher annual stipend amount) in talukas with
the lowest transition rates for girls from class 5 to class 6) to provide incentives to poor families
to send their children to school; and (ii) leverage the provision of schooling by private
entrepreneurs in underserved rural communities. Under the SEF’s PPRS program, the GoS was
to offer a per student subsidy to private entrepreneurs subject to their meeting specified quality
standards for school infrastructure, providing free schooling. It included two DLIs: (a) DLI 6 -
Share of beneficiary girls receiving stipends and number of talukas covered under the DSP; and
(b) DLI 7 - Number of private schools supported by the pilot PPRS program.

IV.     Improving the quality of teaching and student learning, through instituting merit and
needs based recruitment of teachers, improving programs and procedures for their continuous
professional development (CPD) and merit-based career advancement, improving effectiveness of
teacher training programs, and strengthening the provincial diagnostic student learning
assessment and improved classroom assessment. It included three DLIs: (a) DLI 8 -
Implementation of merit based teacher recruitment; (b) DLI 9 - Steps in the implementation of
standards and competency based teacher education and development (number of districts with
pilot CPD program, number of CPD providers accredited, number of colleges offering new
teaching diploma); and (c) DLI 10 - Subjects and grades for annual district representative
diagnostic assessments and production and dissemination of analysis reports.

1.5.3 Component 2 (Technical Assistance, TA) was to finance essential technical, advisory
and capacity building support initiatives to strengthen fiduciary, environmental management,
administrative and M&E activities to assist GoS in SERP implementation towards the
achievement of DLIs and verification of their achievement. Activities were to entail the design
and implementation of reviews, validations, and evaluations by third-party firms. Significant TA
was also financed by other Development Partners (DPs), particularly the EU, and by the GoS
itself (paragraphs 1.7.2 and 2.2.1(c)).

1.6 Revised Components
Project components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes
1.7.1 Scope of reform activities. Two new education sector reforms (rationalization of
teachers across schools and formal allocation of teaching posts to schools, and preparation and
management of school-specific nonsalary budgets) were added to SERP and one existing reform
activity (implementation of the district and sub-district Education Management Reform (EMR)
initiative) was extended to additional districts, at the time of the SEP AF approved by the Board
in March 2011. The SEP AF included three DLIs (see Annex 2). The two new DLIs associated
with the above first two changes were: (i) Allocation of sanctioned teaching posts to schools and
incorporation of school-specific teaching posts in FY2011/12 budget books in at least three
districts; and (ii) preparation of school-specific nonsalary budgets using preliminary minimum
funding standards for schools (MFSS) and incorporation into the FY2011/12 budget books in at

                                                 4
least three districts. The third DLI was an extension of the DLI discussed in Section 1.5.2.II
above, i.e. DLI 4 to include three additional districts.

1.7.2 Funding allocations. The original credit amount was US$300 million equivalent and the
AF was US$50 million equivalent. At the request of the Borrower, SDR 2.67 million (or
US$4.01 million equivalent) was cancelled in June 2012 from the amount allocated to
Component 2 (Technical Assistance) because several TA activities envisaged at the start of the
SEP to be financed by IDA were either financed by other DPs (EU, USAID via its ED-LINKS
initiative, and Asian Development Bank) or by the GoS itself (see paragraph 2.2.1(c)). The
possibility of first using grant financing for TA before using the IDA credit was foreseen at
appraisal and thus was planned for (PAD, page 51).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1.1 Background Analysis: The SEP was a three year investment lending operation after the
close of the first SEDPC in December 2007 and the decision that the next two parts of the DPC
series would not proceed owing to the macro environment and uncertainties regarding the IMF
program. SEDPC supported the design and the first year of implementation of SERP. The new
GoS that came to Office in February 2008 made education a top priority, unambiguously stated
its ownership of and commitment to SERP, showed determination in accelerating implementation,
and requested continued Bank support for SERP. The GoS also continued to build on the results
of the SEDPC (PAD, pages 100-101) by further developing and approving the new SERP policies
(e.g., district education management) and the specific design of key sub-programs (e.g., public
private partnership program). The design of other sub-programs was also further refined or
improved based on experience (e.g., school rehabilitation under the district TOP program).

2.1.2 The preparation of SEP benefitted from the lessons of the GoS’s own implementation
experience, from the experience of Punjab which has been implementing its education sector
reform program since 2003, from a range of analytical and advisory work for Sindh as well as
Pakistan (PAD, pages 98-99), from broader international experience (importance of addressing
teacher quality and the importance of student learning assessments), and from the experience of
similar performance-based Sector Wide Approaches (SWAps) used in other countries,
particularly in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region, mostly in IBRD settings. The key
lessons taken into account were the following:

(a) criticality of strong political commitment and ownership in particular to successfully address
governance constraints;
(b) combining sector interventions with cross-cutting fiscal and fiduciary interventions to enhance
the likelihood of results and sustainability;
(c) provision of complementary non-lending analytical and advisory support and just-in-time
policy and technical assistance notes to support design and implementation of the reform
program;
(d) sustained high level policy dialogue to ensure implementation of key reform actions to
improve sector governance;
(e) simultaneously addressing the issues of school access and quality of education to improve the
socio-economic prospects of individuals; and
(f) the importance of a good M&E system to provide timely and reliable information to inform
the design and implementation.




                                                5
2.1.3 Project Design: The GoS’s program (SERP), which the project supports, was prepared in
a participatory approach through consultations with stakeholders including parents, students,
teachers, communities, SMCs, civil society, GoS officials at the provincial, district and sub-
district levels and the private sector. The Bank team that had already engaged with GoS on the
design of SEDPC continued to be proactively engaged on the SEP program design including
refinements of its subprograms and design of new reform areas, reinforcing ownership and active
participation of the various stakeholders through consultations and technical and advisory support.
The SEP was a Sector Investment Credit with a SWAp to support implementation of the GoS’s
SERP for primary and secondary educations (see Box 1, page 2). Credit disbursements were to
be made against selected key education budget line items or EEPs, based on the achievement of
pre-specified results or DLIs, determined in partnership with GoS (PAD, pages 36-38). The
project also included a small TA component.

2.1.4 DLIs reflected priority elements in the SERP, including implementation performance,
institutional change or intermediate outcome indicators that built incrementally over the project
life. They also represented the conditions needed to overcome the budgetary, governance and
accountability constraints and in turn contribute towards the attainment of the key PDO outcome
indicators. Some of the DLIs were expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness in
education sector interventions during the credit life, and others constituted incremental
institutional steps that would have sustained impacts beyond the project life. The DLI relating to
implementation of the merit-based recruitment of public school teachers was made a necessary
condition for all disbursements, constituting a “global DLI?, because the GoS and the Bank
considered this DLI as (i) central to the achievement of education access and quality targets, (ii)
essential to improve sector governance but entailing high implementation risks, and (iii) an
indicator whose achievement could benefit considerably from the leverage provided by the DP
support.

2.1.5 The European Union (EU) had prepared its support, the Sindh Education Sector Plan
Support Program, in tandem with the Bank’s previous SEDPC and prior to the SEP. The EU’s
support was Euros 33 million in four tranches (budget support) and Euros 6 million in EU-
managed complementary services. The EU supported the SEP and financed a similar set of DLIs,
and held joint review missions with the Bank during the SEP’s implementation.

2.1.6 Risks and Mitigation Measures: All risks were properly identified and well mitigated
through project design and preparation. Despite substantial risks associated with some of the
sector governance improvements (e.g., merit-based teacher recruitment, new district education
management structure and quality assurance of schools, accreditation of teacher training
providers, prioritized school rehabilitation with construction supervision and procurement ex-post
reviews by independent third parties, and internal and external controls for stipends and
textbooks), the high degree of GoS commitment and the use of results based disbursements
(DLIs) mitigated most risks and contributed to the success in implementing even difficult sector
governance improvements.

2.1.7 Quality at Entry: No quality-at-entry assessment of the project was carried out by the
former Quality Assurance Group. A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) was conducted in
February 2009 which endorsed the project design, including the PDO and DLIs, fiduciary
arrangements, and risk assessment and mitigation measures (see Annex 9 for reference). In view
of the sound background analysis, incorporation of the lessons learned, innovative project design
with disbursements linked to achievements of results, high GoS commitment, and comprehensive
assessment of risks, the quality at entry is rated satisfactory.

2.2     Implementation
2.2.1   Implementation was satisfactory or moderately satisfactory throughout the course of the

                                                6
project as rated in the Implementation Status and Results (ISRs) reports. The Bank’s support to
the design of SERP and the first year of its implementation via SEDPC laid a good foundation for
the SEP DLI matrix. Annex 2 shows how the DLIs and their targets under the project SEP were
achieved. The following main factors positively affected implementation:

(a) The results-based design of the SEP with disbursements tied explicitly to the satisfactory
achievement of the DLIs likely helped in orienting and focusing the GoS’s efforts on agreed
program implementation progress and performance targets (see Box 1, page2).

(b) Close donor partnership and coordination throughout project design and implementation
including joint review missions helped ensure that a single program was being supported by the
DPs, also minimizing transaction costs for the GoS.

(c) The TA component played an important complementary role to the results-based component.
Together with the EU and other DPs, the Bank financed selected implementation support and
capacity building activities, efforts to strengthen fiduciary, safeguard and M&E systems and
activities, third party validations, and operational and impact evaluations of selected reforms and
activities. TA resources were the main source of funding for contracting third parties for program
implementation reviews, validations and evaluations. The EU provided TA support for the SMC
subprogram, student diagnostic testing, district and sub-district education management reforms,
the ASC, textbook procurement and overall provincial procurement reforms, logistical support to
the RSU, monitoring visits to the field, and training/information dissemination activities. The
USAID, via its ED-LINKS initiative, provided TA support for the ASC subprogram in selected
districts and the Teacher Education Development (TED) subprogram. The Asian Development
Bank provided TA support for the MTBF activity. The GoS used its own resources for the third-
party supervision of school rehabilitation under the district TOP program.

(d) Strong and continued GoS commitment was central to successful implementation of the
program and for addressing governance constraints to effective service delivery. Many reform
actions to improve the governance and accountability environment required significant breaks
from past practices and challenging deep seated vested interests. Examples include: (i) replacing
the patronage based recruitment of teachers by merit and needs-based, objective and transparent
recruitment and placement of teachers in GoS schools; (ii) replacing past school infrastructure
efforts characterized by poor screening and shoddy or incomplete construction, by a school
rehabilitation program that offered annual grants to districts tied in part to the district’s
performance in meeting construction quality and reporting indicators; (iii) starting a pilot PPRS
program to use GoS funding to leverage the private sector to cost-effectively extend quality and
free schooling to un/under-served communities in order to raise school participation and student
achievement; and (iv) introducing, during the SEP implementation, new bold reforms including
teacher rationalization across schools and fixing teaching posts to schools (SEP AF), and school
system consolidation starting with the merging of adjoining schools.

(e) Regular and sustained dialogue between the Bank and senior level GoS officials and
stakeholders at the district and school level facilitated continuity in SERP and SEP
implementation, particularly in difficult sector governance reforms despite frequent changes in
key senior GoS officials (e.g., the Secretary of Education, GoS). Technical inputs from the Bank,
including analytical reports and just-in-time policy and technical assistance notes, supported
design and implementation of key reform actions.

(f) The Bank team pursued and supported the GoS in the implementation of important
governance actions to reduce fiduciary risks in the sector broadly even when such reform actions
were not explicitly a part of the SEP design and DLIs. Two examples are: (i) substantial
reduction in the risk of leakage through the success of concerted efforts of the RSU, in

                                                7
collaboration with the Finance Department (FD), District Treasury Offices, Accountant General
Offices and the PIFRA Directorate (Project for Improvement of Financial Reporting and
Auditing), in reducing the payment of salaries to education sector employees in cash through
Drawing and Disbursing Officers (DDOs) in the districts rather than via direct deposits into their
personal bank accounts from about 23,000 to 1,200 employees (or from about 10% to 0.5% of the
workforce) as of June 30, 2012; and (ii) agreement with the ED/RSU and the Sindh Textbook
Board (STBB), after extensive dialogue during the SEP implementation, to procure textbooks
starting for FY2012/13 under a single publishing contract rather than through separate contracts
for paper, printing and publishing, to reduce potential inefficiencies and address contract
management concerns.

2.2.2   Main factors that slowed down implementation and hindered progress:

(a) The large scale floods and heavy rains of 2010 and 2011 caused extensive and major damage
to school infrastructure and loss of school and student resources, disruption to school operations,
and economic losses for and the physical displacement of households. They also caused the
diversion of attention, efforts, and scarce funds of the GoS to disaster relief, recovery, and
reconstruction activities.

(b) Frequent turnover of Secretaries of Education during SEP (eight Secretaries of Education
from FY08 to FY11) disrupted continuity and slowed down implementation.

(c) Inadequate staffing in the RSU in particular for procurement (consulting services and contract
management) and environment management affected implementation. Frequent turnover of GoS
officers working at the RSU affected implementation performance and oversight of the SEP.

(d) Inadequate mobility allowances for travel of RSU staff to the field negatively affected
management and monitoring of program implementation progress and performance on the ground.

(e) Weak implementation capacity of the districts to simultaneously implement specific sub-
programs of SERP is likely to have significantly contributed to variable implementation progress
and in some cases may have reduced the substance of the reform actions. Preference of the
districts for maintaining the status quo instead of embracing important reforms and changes is
likely to have also significantly contributed to variable implementation speed.

(f) Implementation performance of the TA (component 2) was affected because of inadequate
planning with sufficient lead time to carry out needed procurement, limited capacity for contract
management, and limited use of the TA resources for meeting the important capacity needs at the
district level and lower levels as well as for key entities, other than the RSU, associated with
SERP (e.g., the Economic Reform Unit (ERU), PEACe, Sindh Education Foundation (SEF), and
those concerned with the teacher education development (TED) and EMR programs).

2.2.3 Quality of Supervision: No quality of supervision assessment of the project was carried
out by the former Quality Assurance Group. The Bank’s Operations Committee reviewed the
project implementation progress after the first year of implementation, and endorsed the Task
Team’s supervision approach and efforts. Very close supervision, timely and intensive technical
support across the reform program, timely preparation of the SEP AF, and a dialogue on the
GoS’s SERP II and follow-on SEP II project helped in successful implementation of the project.

The quality of implementation is rated satisfactory.




                                                 8
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
2.3.1 M&E Design: Four key PDO level outcome indicators and a total of 33 DLI targets (over
three years) were identified to monitor progress towards achieving the PDO. Household sample
surveys (Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement (PSLM) Survey) were to provide
data for two of the four PDO indicators (NER primary and female-male ratio NER primary) and
the ASC was to be used for a third indicator (grade 5-6 transition rate, rural girls). SEP was to
also conduct and make use of annual student diagnostic assessments by The Provincial Education
Assessment Center (PEACe) in grades 4 and 8 in district representative samples of government
schools.

2.3.2 Data reliability for monitoring had been an issue in Sindh for a long time. Continued
strengthening of the M&E was integrated into the SERP design and the SEP supported the M&E
strengthening through DLIs, EEPs and TA. Selected M&E activities, including rigorous impact
evaluations, were to be also supported through Bank staff inputs and grants from the Education
Program Development Fund (EPDF). The M&E in the GoS’s program includes the annual
census of public schools (ASC), monitoring and evaluation of SERP interventions by the RSU
and third parties, monitoring of student learning outcomes over time via PEACe, expenditure
tracking and benefit incidence analysis, and rigorous impact evaluations using prospective
designs of selected sub-programs. In addition, results of PSLM surveys were to be used to
monitor and triangulate findings on outcomes.

2.3.3 M&E Implementation: The M&E system worked generally as planned except for the
pace of improvements in the ASC. First, performance of key project activities was maintained
and compliance with the agreed parameters under the DLIs was assessed through independent,
transparent third party validations (TPVs). For example, the TPVs were used to monitor and
evaluate compliance with the agreed DLIs for the rehabilitation of schools, ASC data (quality),
activation of the SMCs, delivery of stipends to girls, and merit and needs based recruitment of
teachers. Second, several impact evaluations were carried out, such as of the capacity building
pilot of SMCs in school improvement planning, stipends for girls in low transition-rate talukas
under the DSP, and the SEF PPRS program, to help inform policy and design discussions and
decisions on scale-up of the sub-programs. Third, the GoS through PEACe successfully
completed a programmed cycle of diagnostic assessments of student learning in selected subjects
in grades 4 and 8; data from the most recent assessments (2011 and 2012) is still under analysis.

2.3.4 Fourth, the ASC remained the GoS’s primary data activity for its public schools and
provided information on school characteristics, enrollment by grade and gender, and teacher level
information. Under SERP, the Bank, EU and USAID (through its ED-LINKS initiative)
supported agreed efforts to strengthen the ASC at both the province and district levels, in
particular the ASC administrative procedures and strengthening human and technological
resources at RSU which managed the ASC activity. Despite significant improvements in
timeliness and quality of data of the ASC under SERP (though the ASC had been conducted for
nearly 18 years, there was no verification of the quality of the data in the ASC until the start of
the SERP), several weaknesses remain in the quality and reliability of the ASC. Weaknesses in
the ASC data arise in part due to the capacity issues at the district and taluka level, poor record
keeping in school registers, and poor field visit practices by supervisors to schools to collect
information. These weaknesses have hampered the ability to track certain indicators and monitor
performance of SEP in areas that rely on the ASC data (e.g., transition rates). Continued
strengthening of the ASC to yield regular and reliable information on public schools will remain a
key initiative under SERP II.

2.3.5 Baseline data on teacher and student absenteeism were to be established in 2009/10 and
decline in the absenteeism rates were to be measured in 2011/12 through school surveys by third
party firms. Rounds of school surveys by a third party firm on teacher absenteeism could not be

                                                9
carried out because the survey was linked to the TPV of the teacher recruitment program and
recruitment under Round 2 was not completed on time. However, the first round of school survey
as part of the TPV of the teachers recruited under Round 1 found an absenteeism rate of 16% for
these contract teachers compared to 21% among regular teachers in the same schools. On student
absenteeism, rounds of school surveys by a third party firm were also not carried out, and thus the
indicator could not be tracked. These surveys are now planned to be carried out in SERP II.

2.3.6 M&E Utilization: The M&E data was used by the RSU and the Bank and EU to inform
assessment of the SERP and SEP and decision making. For example:

    •   The M&E data on the results-based specific targets (DLIs) to be achieved for
        disbursements to take place was very helpful in keeping implementation of the reform
        actions on track, and/or in the case of delays or problems to discuss and agree on
        corrective actions to get back on track. For example, when the target for accurate data in
        the ASC (FY2010/11) was not met, the Bank, EU and the ED/RSU agreed on a remedial
        action plan for the ED to send a strong message to district education and school
        administrators of zero tolerance for misreporting of data starting with the ASC
        FY2011/12, and including a number of confidence building measures (Annex 2).
    •   Data on the timeliness of delivery of textbooks and stipends for girls in public schools
        proved helpful in keeping such service delivery on track.
    •   When due diligence by the Bank team during analysis and review of the payroll data
        (education staff) revealed that a significant share of staff was receiving salaries in cash
        through DDOs rather than as direct deposits into their personal bank accounts posing a
        potential risk of leakage, the Bank, ED, ERU/FD, and others in GoS worked to correct
        the practice (see paragraph 2.2.1 (f)).

2.3.7 Quality and reliability of data used in the ICR is generally good except for the
questionable quality and reliability of the ASC data, particularly the transition rate (see
paragraphs 2.3.4, 3.2.12 and 3.2.13).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguard compliance is rated satisfactory on account of the following achievements/ issues:

2.4.1 Environmental aspect: The SERP overall was expected to result in environmental
benefits. However, some project activities such as rehabilitation and/or upgrading of school
buildings and addition of missing facilities under the district TOP program could lead to non-
significant and minor negative environmental impacts.            In early 2010, some of the
recommendations from the reports on water quality, construction quality and natural hazards
prepared by consultants as well a draft UNICEF report on water, sanitation and hygiene were
incorporated into the designs and guidelines prepared by the third party construction supervision
firm and provided to the district governments, and used in PC-1s and Standard Bidding
Documents (SBDs) for the school rehabilitation initiative under the TOP program.

2.4.2 The environmental management benefits under the district TOP program were major.
The area of significant accomplishment was in the school design and construction. The use of
unframed structures was abandoned and replaced by the use of framed reinforced concrete
structures (RCC), which are stronger and thus less vulnerable to earthquakes. To reduce the
vulnerability to floods, measures such as raising school floors above known flood levels were
also adopted. Pakistan has a long history of earthquakes and severe floods with thousands of
fatalities and extensive damages (e.g., according to the Pakistan government, the death toll of the
2005 earthquake in Kashmir alone was more than 75,000, including thousands of school children).
Improved designs and well-built structures might therefore save thousands of lives. Framed


                                                10
structures allow the use of larger windows that resulted in well-lighted and better ventilated
classrooms (without the use of electricity) that are more appealing to children, particularly in the
hot summer months when the temperatures can be quite high. Boundary walls were built with
proper heights, making it safer for children to attend school and to prevent vandalisms in off-
school hours. Some variations in the construction quality and degree of completeness indicate the
need of more strict construction supervision by district engineers, and by the third-party
construction supervision firm.

2.4.3 The project also reached out to the private sector, distributed the Environmental and
Social Management Framework (ESMF) to the contractors, and to entrepreneurs under the SEF’s
PPRS program as well as held orientation workshops for the PPRS program entrepreneurs. The
RSU did not recruit an Environmental Coordinator but ensured that the third party firm hired for
construction supervision and validation of school rehabilitation works under the TOP program
had an environmental specialist on the team. Overall, the above project activities remained in
compliance with the ESMF, and the use of the firm to screen and supervise construction in the
field was a significant positive step towards increased attention to environmental aspects.

2.4.4 Despite compliance, there were some challenges during implementation, including weak
ownership of the ESMF particularly in the Public Works Department, and limited capacity
building in districts for ESMF implementation. Overall, however, teachers and headmasters of
the rehabilitated schools commented favorably on the quality of construction, concrete reinforced
structures to protect buildings against earthquakes and floods, and boundary walls for safety.
Planned environment enhancement pilots (i.e., to provide low-cost power from renewable sources
to schools without electricity, and cost-effective interventions to remove contaminants such as
arsenic and fluoride, and disinfect water to ensure safe drinking water facilities at schools) did not
take off due to problems in hiring a firm, and will now be carried out under SERP II.

2.4.5 Social aspects: Land for school rehabilitation activities under the district TOP program
was obtained via donations. School buildings under the PPRS program were either rented or
owned by the entrepreneurs.

2.4.6 Successful implementation of several interventions in the SERP supported by the SEP is
likely to have contributed to the significant increase of girls in schools in rural areas. The female-
male ratio NER, rural Sindh, primary level, increased from 68% in 2007/08 to 72% in 2010/11
and in secondary schools in rural areas from 32% in 2007/08 to 40% in 2010/11 exceeding the
targets for 2011/12. The PPRS program extended quality schooling to un/underserved
communities in rural areas, targeting the worst-off districts. Rigorous evaluation results show
that the program had a major impact on improving participation and achievement outcomes for
rural children and for both girls and boys. The program drew nearly all young children into
school (the average share of children going to school in communities with PPRS program schools
is 90% versus 59% in control communities), and produced substantially higher achievement gains
than other (principally GoS) schools that children attend in the evaluation communities. Children
enrolled in school as a result of the PPRS program answered additional 14 and 9 questions
correctly in the math and local-language tests, respectively, while children enrolled in school
(principally GoS schools) answered additional 7 and 5 questions correctly in the math and local-
language tests, respectively.

2.4.7 In addition to the PPRS program, key interventions that are likely to have contributed to
the positive achievements were: (i) higher stipends to girls in low-transition rate (rural) talukas
through DSP, (ii) gender sensitive teacher recruitment (additional marks to female candidates
given in the objective scoring of the candidates), (iii) school rehabilitation through the district
TOP program to bring infrastructure improvements including provision of toilets and boundary
walls that were critical for girls, and (iv) incentives such as free and timely delivery textbooks

                                                 11
and stipends for girls enrolled in classes 6 to 10 in public schools that are likely to have
influenced particularly poor households to send their children to school. The Bank’s impact
evaluation of the DSP indicates that the initiative increased the retention of girls in secondary
grade, thus contributing to higher student attainment.

Fiduciary compliance is rated moderately satisfactory on account of the following achievements
and issues:

2.4.8 Financial management (FM) rating remained moderately satisfactory through the project.
With (i) the GoS’s demonstrated strong commitment to improving public financial management
(PFM), (ii) the provision of PIFRA computer terminals to the ED and RSU for budget execution
reporting and monitoring across the province, and (iii) the fact that education expenditures
constitute a significant outlay in the GoS budget, timely, comprehensive and accurate expenditure
reporting arrangements for the entire sector were already a key area of attention at both the RSU
and the FD. The required staff for the FM unit in the RSU was already in place at the SEP start
up. However, there were issues in retaining the full services of the FM staff. The internal audit
specialist (IAS) had to dedicate his attention towards meeting the targets for resolution of the
outstanding audit paragraphs, and could not make tangible recommendations for strengthening
the internal controls in the education sector. After the IAS left the RSU in April 2011, it was
decided to revise the Terms of Reference but the position could not be filled by the SEP closing
date. All required financial reports were submitted; however there were delays in the submission
of the interim unaudited financial reports.

2.4.9 A key achievement was the strengthening of the system of reviews by the Departmental
Accounts Committee (DAC) and resolution of the cumulative backlog of advance audits
paragraphs for the education sector per the agreed schedule, facilitated by the strong support from
the Secretary of Education. This activity is likely to have fostered the accountability regime
within the education sector. In April 2011, concerns arose concerning the payment of salaries of
about 23,000 education sector employees in cash through the DDOs in the districts. Through the
concerted efforts of the RSU and others in the GoS, the number of employees receiving salary in
cash was reduced to 1,200 or from 10% to 0.5% of the education sector workforce. Steps are
however yet to be taken for systematic process for reviewing and correcting the historical payroll
data for education sector staff and ensuring its consistency with personnel records held by the line
department, and for formally adopting the necessary measures to strengthen internal controls in
this important area of expenditure.

2.4.10 Procurement: At the time of SEP preparation, a revised procurement law was already in
place. The SERP and SEP supported through legal covenants and TA the implementation of an
improved procurement regulatory and institutional framework for the province, and good
practices in implementation of these procurement rules in the education sector. SERP provided a
platform for continued engagement in the procurement reform dialogue with the Sindh Public
Procurement Regulatory Agency (SPPRA) which led towards SPPRA’s notification of
procurement rules and standard bidding documents (SBD) for goods and works; and standard
Request for a Proposal (RFP) for consultancy services. SPPRA is in the process of developing
some implementing regulations. The next steps identified by SPPRA are the development of
sector specific SBDs, establishment of an M&E system for procurement performance,
development of procurement competencies and e-procurement strategy. The GoS had already set
up a system of quarterly updates on the Composite Schedule of Rates (CSR) but its robust
implementation is yet to be seen.

2.4.11 Procurement of all EEPs and TA under the SEP and SEP AF was carried out in
accordance with the Bank guidelines. The civil works contracts under the district TOP programs
signed between districts and RSU for civil works were not an EEP, and hence they were required

                                                12
to follow SPPRA rules. TOPs emphasized the application of SPPRA rules, use of bidding
documents agreed by the Bank (till SPPRA SBDs are notified), and an ex-post procurement
review to be commissioned by the RSU. The past practice had been that the contracts were
awarded on school basis which resulted in thousands of scattered contracts, diluting the focus on
quality of contractors, construction as well as contract management. For school rehabilitation
works under the district TOP program, contracts were planned at the taluka level rather than at
school level which consolidated contracts to a marketable size attracting good firms, making
contract management more efficient, and the RSU hired a third party construction supervision
firm to ensure compliance with the contractual stipulations. The ex-post reviews were also
conducted by this construction supervision firm. Findings of ex-post procurement reviews
provided a useful basis for discussion with the districts as well as private sector to improve upon
the procurement practices. The project also provided a platform to discuss the textbook
procurement (though not an EEP in SEP) and agree on actions to improve the procurement
procedures (see paragraph 2.2.1 (f)).

2.4.12 Issues in procurement were mainly linked to continued capacity constraints. The RSU
did not appoint staff conversant with consultancy selection and contract management, citing a
dearth of such procurement specialists in the local market. The lack of procurement staff with
relevant experience led to (i) delays in updating procurement plans, in getting the website
operational, and in contract awards due to the several iterations necessary before the Bank could
clear documents; (ii) decreased efficiency of consultancy assignments; and (iii) lags in
deliverables. The procurement rating therefore remained moderately satisfactory throughout the
project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
2.5.1 Even before the SEP closed, the GoS had started design and early implementation of the
second Sindh Education Sector Reform Program (SERP II), incorporating the lessons learned on
challenges, constraints and opportunities from the SEP implementation and elsewhere, and
building on the reforms initiated and carried out under the SEP. The GoS has asked for the
Bank’s support for its SERP II through financing a proposed Second Sindh Education Sector
Project (SEP II), scheduled for delivery in early 2013. The SERP II is being designed to carry
forward some of the successful governance and accountability initiatives under SERP and to add
in complementary governance and accountability initiatives that can maximize the reform dose
felt and quickly yield positive results at the school level. To ensure the success of SERP II, the
GoS also plans to strengthen implementation arrangements and coordination. SEP II design will
be similar to that of the SEP, and include a results based component disbursing against
achievement of DLIs and a well-defined TA component. Currently, the GoS is itself financing
key consultancies to support SERP II implementation whose costs will be retroactively
reimbursed from SEP II upon approval and effectiveness.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
3.1.1 Objectives: The SEP objectives remain highly relevant to the Government of Pakistan’s
development priorities articulated in PRSP II (see paragraph 1.1.7). The project objectives (to
increase school participation, reduce gender and rural-urban disparities, increase progression, and
improve the measurement of learning) were well connected to the education sector priorities of
the PRSP II.

3.1.2 The SEP objectives also remained highly relevant and consistent with the Bank’s Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2010-13 which was later extended to FY2014 at the time of the
CPS Progress Report (November 2011). Two of the four Pillars of the CPS emphasized (i)


                                                13
improving access to education with a focus on equity to address regional and gender imbalances,
school outcomes of female children, and quality of education including through improved
systems to measure student learning, and strengthened governance and accountability of
education service providers at all levels (Pillar 2); and (ii) strengthened public expenditures,
financial and procurement management, and enhanced capacity and accountability in public
sector management (Pillar 1). The SEP objectives and its reform activities as reflected in the DLI
matrix were consistent with the above priorities of the CPS.

3.1.3 Although the Bank’s Education Sector Strategy 2020 came into effect after the SEP, yet
the project development objectives were also relevant to the new sector strategy which
emphasizes (i) “learning for all? (not just schooling but learning); (ii) quality, with learning gains
as a key metric of quality, needs to be a focus of education investments (access alone is not
enough); (iii) lowering the barriers that keep girls (and women) from attaining as much education
as other population groups; (iv) strengthening education systems, namely, aligning governance,
management of schools and teachers, financing rules, accountability mechanisms, and incentive
mechanisms with the goal of learning for all; and (v) evidence-based policy making and
innovations.

3.1.4 Design: The SEP design (Box 1 on page 2, Section 1.5 and Annex 2) reflected a proper
diagnosis of the sector development priorities that have remained relevant throughout the life of
the project. It also focused explicitly on the achievement of results (project components and
implementation arrangements) which is consistent with both the Bank’s current CPS and the
Government’s PRSP II priorities. The SEP’s results framework and the DLI matrix reflect the
connections between the SEP objectives and the Bank’s CPS and the Government’s PRSP II.

3.1.5 Implementation: The Bank’s implementation support together with the DPs was and
remained responsive to the government’s needs to achieving its education objectives and
priorities (enunciated in the SERP and PRSP II), and to the Bank’s CPS for the country and the
Education Sector Strategy 2020.         The joint review missions throughout the project
implementation engaged in high-level policy dialogue and conducted the necessary due diligence
and provided continued technical advice as needed. The SEP objectives remained unchanged
even at the time of SEP AF.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
3.2.1 Achievement of the PDO was to be measured using four PDO-level results indicators
(paragraph 1.2.2). Achievement of the DLIs for the key reform subprograms in SERP was also a
key to the success of the program and achievement of the SEP’s project development objectives
(Section 1.5 and Annex 2). In addition, several other indicators including the NER secondary
level and female-male ratio NER, rural Sindh, secondary level were also a part of the results
framework (PAD, page 35).

3.2.2 Effect of floods: Sindh was affected by the large scale floods and heavy rains of 2010 and
2011 (a natural event) that are likely to have significantly impacted the functioning and
performance of the education sector. Each flooding event by itself caused extensive, major
damage to school infrastructure and loss of school and student resources, disruption to school
operations, economic losses for and the physical displacement of households, and the diversion of
attention, efforts, and scarce funds of the GoS to disaster relief, recovery, and reconstruction
activities. Two events in a row, with significant overlap in flood-affected districts, were crippling,
likely resulting in a prolonged recovery period. The floods are likely to have affected the
achievement of all PDO and other indicators including participation, transition, and completion
rates, regardless of whether an indicator had a shortfall against the target or exceeded the target.
Adverse effects of these floods on the results indicators are likely to be persistent for some time


                                                 14
to come and reflected in the future rounds of the PSLM survey and ASC data when they are
released.

PDO 1: Increase school participation.
Indicators: (1) NER, primary education (5-9 years old, 1-5 grades) -- PDO outcome indicator, (2)
NER, secondary education (10-14 years old, 6-10 grades) -- other key performance indicator
(KPI).

3.2.3 SEP supported the design and implementation of several key demand and supply side
reform initiatives under SERP that directly promoted school participation (see Annex 2): (i)
PPRS program extended quality schooling to un/underserved communities. About 450 new
schools were established with an enrollment of about 65,000 students; (ii) merit-based, objective,
and transparent recruitment and placement of teachers in GoS schools with over 13,000 teachers
locally recruited and placed in schools; (iii) school rehabilitation under the district TOP program
to provide missing facilities (e.g., toilets and boundary walls) and buildings for shelterless schools,
primarily in rural areas where the needs were the greatest. About 1,800 schools were rehabilitated
and 250 schools were close to being completed by end FY2011/12; (iv) improvements in the
delivery of stipends for girls in public secondary schools; cumulatively, a total of about 1.5
million girls in class 6 to 10 between 2008/09 and 2011/12 received stipends; (v) under a refined
targeting (Differential Stipends Program or DSP), SEP provided higher stipends to secondary
school girls in low transition rate talukas; cumulatively, a total of 346,000 girls received stipends
under the DSP during 2007/08 and 2011/12; and (vi) improved delivery of textbooks at no cost to
the students with over 90% of the books being delivered within the first month of school opening.

3.2.4 Improved infrastructure inputs increased accessibility to quality school facilities,
particularly in disadvantaged areas (e.g., un/undeserved areas) and are likely to have brought
school-age children into the schools that had remained out of school until now. Presence of
qualified and locally recruited teachers led to improved teacher presence and better quality
teaching. Reduced cost of schooling through the incentive programs (e.g., stipends and free
textbooks, and their timely delivery) is likely to also have influenced households to send children
to school, when they might not have done so otherwise, especially for poor families who often
decide to keep some of the children out of school to assist in household work. Implementation
performance of the incentive programs was substantially enhanced through strengthened delivery
mechanisms and close monitoring, including by the TPVs. The above interventions were
implemented satisfactorily.

3.2.5 The NER for primary education (5-9 years old, 1-5 grades) increased from 50.3% in
2006/07 to 51% in 2007/08, 54% in 2008/09 and 53% in 2010/11; value for 2009/10 is not
available because the GoS did not gather comparable survey data that year (PSLM survey results
for 2011/12 are also not yet released). The project achieved 51% of the target in 2010/11 (the
target was 55.6% by 2011/12). While the above initiatives in SERP are likely to have improved
participation, large scale floods and rains in 2010 & 2011 (see paragraph 3.2.2) – natural events --
are also likely to have resulted in a shortfall in the achievement of the NER-primary education
against the target as the progress on the NER-primary that was on a positive incline in the first
year of the SEP (2008/09) was likely to have been abruptly slowed (the primary-NER in 2010/11
was marginally poorer than in 2008/09). It is likely that the primary-NER value for 2011/12,
when the 2011/12 PSLM survey statistics are released, would show no improvement or even a
drop, as the province is still recovering from the devastating floods.

3.2.6 The NER for secondary education (10-14 years old, 6-10 grades) increased from 26.4%
in 2006/07 to 27.5% in 2007/08, 30.2% in 2008/09 and 29.8% in 2010/11 (PSLM survey results).
Though 227% of the target (27.9% in 2011/12) was achieved (or of the expected increase in the
NER for secondary education) one year ahead of the target year, the NER-secondary was

                                                 15
marginally poorer than in 2008/09, in part due to the likely effects of the floods. Without the
floods, the achievement could have been more. The targeted interventions supported by the SEP
(stipends for secondary school girls, school rehabilitation including missing school facilities,
focus on proactive recruitment of female teachers under the merit and needs based recruitment of
teachers, and free textbooks) are likely to have contributed significantly to the improved NER for
secondary education, offsetting the likely negative impact of the floods.

3.2.7 The achievement of the objective to increase school participation, primary education, is
rated moderately satisfactory. While the full achievement is short of the targets, two factors
warrant a moderately satisfactory rating: (i) secondary education NER target has already been
significantly exceeded and is likely to exceed the target when the 2011/12 PSLM survey statistics
are released; and (ii) the progress on the NER-primary that was on the positive incline until
2008/09 was likely to have been abruptly slowed by the two consecutive floods and heavy rains, a
factor outside the GoS’s control.

PDO 2: Reduce gender and rural-urban disparities in school participation.
Indicators: (1) Female-male ratio NER, primary, rural, 5-9 years, 1-5 grades -- PDO outcome
indicator, (2) Female-male ratio NER, secondary, rural, 10-14 years old, 6-10 grade -- other KPI.

3.2.8 The successful design and implementation of the SEP programs particularly the new
innovative programs targeted to reach the most disadvantaged groups discussed in paragraphs
3.2.3 and 3.2.4 and Annex 2 resulted in a satisfactory achievement of the objective (PDO 2). The
female-male ratio NER in primary education in rural Sindh where the gender equality has been
the worst (5-9 years old, 1-5 grades) increased remarkably from 61.2% in 2006/07 to 71.9% in
2010/11 (target was 64.6% in 2011/12, the PSLM survey statistics for 2011/12 are not yet
available); thus 315% of the target was achieved, one year ahead of the target year. In addition,
the female-male ratio NER in secondary education in rural Sindh (10-14 years old, 6-10 grades)
increased from 32.3% in 2006/07 to 40.3% in 2010/11 (target was 39.2% in 2011/12); thus 116%
of the target was achieved, one year ahead of the target year. Achievement of the PDO by
improving access and equity to the most disadvantaged, and through simultaneous focus on the
quality of learning, is a key step towards reducing the gender and regional disparities. The
targeted interventions supported by the SEP are likely to have contributed significantly to the
improved female-male ratio NERs for both primary and secondary education, offsetting the likely
negative impact of the floods.

PDO 3: Increase progression.
Indicators: (1) Primary school completion rate; and (2) Transition rate from class 5 to class 6,
public schools, rural girls.

3.2.9 Initiatives under the SERP and SEP (e.g., placement of quality teachers in schools on
merit and needs basis including additional marks to female candidates, teacher education
development (TED), strengthening of district and sub-district education management for service
delivery (EMR reforms), school rehabilitation with a particular focus on missing facilities (i.e.
toilets and boundary walls), stipends for secondary school girls and higher stipends for secondary
school girls in low transition rate talukas, the PPRS program, and strengthening of SMCs) were
designed to promote greater school quality and better school management. The idea was that
these improvements would in turn promote retention of students in school with a particular
attention to girls, completion of primary schooling and progression to secondary education. The
GoS satisfactorily met the DLIs for these initiatives including laying foundation for continuing
the longer term TED and EMR reforms and the strengthening of SMCs (Annex 2).

3.2.10 The primary completion rate for all Sindh increased from 53.4% in 2006/07 to 58.3% in
2010/11 (PSLM survey data), exceeding the target of 55.2% for 2011/12 (a 272% achievement of

                                                 16
the target (or of the expected increase in the completion rate)). The PSLM survey statistics are of
satisfactory quality and have been produced over long periods without any significant issues.

3.2.11 The target for transition rate (from class 5 to class 6, rural girls, public schools) is unmet.
PAD had projected the transition rate to increase from 51.2% in 2007/08 to 63.4% in 2011/12 (a
projected increase of 12.2 percentage points). In 2011/12, the GoS removed the rural/urban
classification of schools due to changing rural/urban status on the ground, and hence the Bank’s
Task Team could not track the original indicator. The new statistic is class 5-6 transition rate,
public schools, girls in all districts excluding Karachi and Hyderabad which are predominantly
urban districts. Using the same data but the new definition, the baseline value was 49.7% and the
value of the statistic estimated at completion (2011/12) was 55% (an increase of 5.3 percentage
points); the end-year target using the new definition would have been 61.9%. The original end-
year target of 63.4% in the PAD is not applicable due to the definition change.

3.2.12 The ICR team feels that the poor achievement on the transition rate is very likely the
result of estimating this statistic from administrative data whose reliability and quality at baseline
is highly questionable. As discussed in paragraph 2.3.4, quality of ASC data is still a concern but
relative to baseline data quality has shown improvements. Prior to 2009/10 when the first TPV
was conducted, there was no independent assessment of the quality of enrollment data collected
under Annual School Census, leading to highly incorrect data. The table below shows the Grade
5 and Grade 6 enrollment data for public schools in Sindh to illustrate the problem with the
quality of the ASC data.

         Table 1: Enrollment in Sindh, Grades 5- 6, Public Schools, 2008/09-2010/11
                                   2008-09            2009-10               2010-11
         Grade 5                   524,194             389,457              386,666
         Grade 6                   447,061             240,083              237,064

3.2.13 In 2009/10, with improvements in administration of school census (introduction of third
party validation or TPV), more accurate estimates for enrollments of Grade 5 and Grade 6 were
obtained. Also, data for secondary school enrollments had apparently improved by a greater
margin than for primary school enrollments. Given the smaller proportion of secondary schools
in the province (less than 20%) the probability of sampling a secondary school for TPV is higher,
resulting in greater improvement in the quality of ASC data for secondary schools. Any
comparison of ratios based on ASC data prior to 2009/10 and at project completion is therefore
misleading. Hence the ICR team feels that owing to poor data quality the transition rate in
hindsight should not have been included as a PDO level indicator.

3.2.14 The progress on the two indicators was mixed: (i) the achievement of the target for the
primary completion rate for all Sindh was 272%; and (ii) the baseline value for transition rate was
not applicable and hence the achievement of transition rate cannot be ascertained. Conservatively
the achievement on PDO 3 is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

PDO 4: Improve the measurement of learning
Indicator: Learning levels monitored through diagnostic student assessments.

3.2.15 To improve the measurement of learning, the SEP supported the strengthening of PEACe
as the agency with primary responsibility to carry out a programmatic cycle of diagnostic
assessments in selected subjects in grades 4 and 8 in district representative samples of GoS
schools. The PEACe completed the following assessments over the SEP period: (i) math test for
grade 4 students (3,500 schools) in 2008/09; (ii) language test for grade 4 students (3,500
schools) in 2009/10; and (iii) follow-up math test for grade 4, science test for grade 4, and math


                                                 17
test for grade 8 in 2010/11 for a total sample of 65,920 students in 6,531 schools. In addition,
PEACe conducted the social studies test for grade 4, follow-up language test for grade 4, and the
language test for grade 8 in 2011/12. Analysis and reports of the grade 4 math and language
assessments, completed in 2008/09 and 2009/10, respectively, were completed and findings
discussed with key stakeholders (e.g., ED, STBB, Provincial Institute of Teacher Education
(PITE) and RSU). Although not a part of the DLI, completion of the analysis of the 2010/11
follow-up math test in particular would have been helpful in monitoring the learning level in
math; PEACe was constrained in analyzing the data by its limited capacity. PEACe needs further
support to strengthen its capacity for test design, test administration, and analysis and for wide
dissemination of the findings to key stakeholders and the public. Achievement of PDO 4 is rated
moderately satisfactory.

3.2.16 The SERP also aimed at improving resource allocation and management for the
education sector that cut across the entire sector reform program and thereby contribute to the
achievement of the program’s development objectives. Though not strictly a PDO, the SEP
performance of the activities in support of this pillar is rated satisfactory. Four key achievements
were:

(a) The GoS integrated the results based SERP into the MTFF, and the education budget was
executed in alignment with the MTFF/MTBF although releases of some budget line items were
delayed at times during the SEP. Fulfillment of DLI 1 (see Annex 2) related to the first thrust
area -- education budget, including SERP expenditures, consistent with MTFF -- helped protect
the financing of SERP and ensure effective use of public education expenditures during project
implementation.
(b) Financial accountability and transparency in the education sector was enhanced through the
resolution of outstanding advance audit paragraphs. Actual achievements exceeded the targets:
by April 2009, a reduction of 40% (target 35%) of 7,639 cumulative outstanding advance audit
paragraphs since FY2005/06; by April 2010, a reduction of 63% (target 60%) of 3,854 residual
advance audit paragraphs for FY2007/08; and by April 2011, a reduction of 64% (target 60%) of
3,917 residual advance audit paragraphs for FY2008/09.
(c) Procurement regulatory and institutional framework and procurement management in the
education sector were improved (see paragraph 2.4.10).
(d) Improved procurement management and supervision of schools’ rehabilitation under the
district TOP program was achieved (see paragraph 2.4.11).

3.3 Efficiency
3.3.1 Efficiency in achieving the project objectives in terms of net present value (NPV) is
satisfactory. The details of the approach and assumptions are given in Annex 3.

3.3.2 A cost-benefit analysis using the present discounted value (PDV) method was carried out
at appraisal. The current and future economic benefits and costs incurred for a representative
child age 5 (the official age for entering primary school in grade 1 at appraisal) given a projected
average school attainment profile when the child reaches age 18 were estimated for two cases: (1)
without SERP, and (2) with SERP (see Annex 3). The difference between the two estimates
provides the expected incremental net benefits per representative child age 5, and a positive
expected incremental net benefit implies that the investment was worth pursuing at appraisal.

3.3.3 The PDV of expected economic benefits of primary and secondary schooling were
derived by estimating real lifetime labor earnings based on age-earning profiles for 15-65 year
olds. The PDV of expected economic costs comprised both direct (public expenditures on public
and primary schooling) and indirect (forgone labor earnings of children age 10 and above) costs
of attaining each school completion level.


                                                18
3.3.4 At appraisal, the NPV of the SERP was estimated at PKR 33,150 per child using a
discount rate of 5% (base case), and PKR 2,400 per child using a discount rate of 10% (sensitivity
analysis). As noted in Annex 3, at completion, the ICR team estimates the NPV for SERP of
PKR 130,500 per child using a discount rate of 5%, and PKR 22,800 per child using a discount
rate of 10%. In both cases, estimated NPVs are higher. This shows the desirability of investment
in SERP even at a high discount rate of 10%. The ICR team prefers the estimate with the 10%
discount rate as, over the SEP period, interest rates stayed at 10% or more and the ICR team
expects these rates to remain high due to poor current and future macroeconomic conditions,
resulting in significant price increases.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
3.4.1 The overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. The PDOs and design remained
highly relevant throughout project implementation and continue to remain relevant today.
Efficiency of the project also remained satisfactory. The moderately satisfactory outcome rating
reflects (i) substantial satisfactory achievement of the project’s objective to reduce gender and
rural disparities (PDO 2), (ii) moderately satisfactory achievement of the objectives to increase
school participation (PDO 1), and to improve the measurement of learning (PDO 4), and (iii)
moderately unsatisfactory achievement of the objective to increase progression (PDO 3). Several
other key indicators exceeded the targets (e.g., primary school completion, female-male ratio for
secondary education, and NER for secondary education). Table 2 provides a summary of scores
of different aspects of project outcomes, using a six point scale to serve as a check on the overall
assessment of the outcome rating.

3.4.2 The achievement of the PDO and other indicators was however affected by the external
shock of large scale floods and these effects are likely to persist for some time to come (see
paragraph 3.2.2).

3.4.3 The GoS met, during the SEP implementation, all 33 DLI targets including the 3 DLI
targets that were added during implementation arising from the GoS initiated extension of the
initiatives under SERP to new reform areas. While in some cases, the project outputs also
exceeded the DLI targets, only one DLI needed a significant adjustment (ASC in the M&E


                                                   19
subprogram). The project succeeded in supporting the adoption, refinements and implementation
of some difficult policy reform actions under the SERP and the SEP. Three initiatives that
yielded significant results at the service delivery level were (i) the merit and needs based
recruitment of teachers (see Box 2), (ii) performance based grants to districts for school
rehabilitation under the district TOP program (paragraphs 3.2.3 and 3.2.4; Annex 2, sub-program
2), and (iii) use of GoS funding to leverage the private sector to cost-effectively extend quality
schooling to un/underserved communities in order to raise school participation and student
achievement (paragraphs 3.2.3 and 3.2.4; Annex 2, sub-program 7). Foundation has also been
laid for improved medium term education sector budgeting, and improved financial
accountability and procurement policies and procedures. As a result of the project, the sector
governance and accountability mechanisms have also been strengthened.

Box 2: Merit-based, objective, and transparent recruitment & placement of teachers in GoS schools:
Recruitment of teachers in Sindh has historically been patronage based, often without due consideration of
whether the new hire was appropriately qualified and/or whether there was a genuine need at the school
where the new hire was placed. In addition, academic and professional qualifications used to screen and
select candidates are generally viewed in the country as a poor signal of candidate knowledge and ability in
part because of concerns regarding the quality and integrity of diploma and certificate conferring
institutions. This state of affairs potentially compromises teacher quality at entry and the alignment of
teacher interest and efforts with desired duties and responsibilities over the teacher’s service period.

The new recruitment policy under SERP delineated merit-based, objective, transparent, and standardized
criteria for recruiting new teachers under school-specific, fixed-term (three-year) contracts. Under the new
policy, (1) the candidate was required to pass a standardized, written knowledge test designed and
administered by an independent testing agency; (2) female candidates were given additional marks in the
objective scoring of the candidates; (3) the candidate was not subject to a selection interview (reducing the
possibility for bias by eliminating room for discretion); (4) candidates were ranked using a composite score
that summed up the test score and points for other relevant attributes and job offers were made starting
from the top-ranked candidate and moving down on the list; (5) the qualifying candidate was to be placed
at a school under a nontransferable, school-specific contract which implied that the teacher could not be
transferred between schools; and (6) to the extent possible, the qualifying candidate for primary-school
teaching service was placed locally (i.e., within the union council where the candidate had residence).

Two rounds of recruitment and placement of about 13,000 teachers have been completed under SERP. In
the second round, needs-based placement was also introduced where a qualifying candidate for primary-
school teaching service would only be hired if an understaffed school was identified (a student-teacher ratio
(STR) higher than a STR floor) in the qualifying candidate’s union council of residence. Descriptive
evidence from a school sample survey conducted by a third-party firm indicates that the new teachers
recruited in Round 1 had a higher presence rate than older co-teachers in the same schools.

3.4.4 Overall, key development outcomes have contributed to the improvements in the access,
equity and quality of the education sector. These achievements are expected to have long-term
benefits of improving education outcomes as the reform program and investments are sustained,
with continued Bank support of the GoS’s SERP II program.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
3.5.1 Various elements of SERP aimed at improving equity by reducing relative female and
rural disadvantages. The incentive programs -- the on-time and regular delivery of free textbooks
to public schools (this incentive is likely to have had greater impact for the rural and poor),
regular conditional cash transfers offered to girls as well as higher conditional cash transfers to
girls attending public secondary schools in low transition-rate talukas (which are predominantly
in rural areas) are likely to have helped increase enrollment by reducing the cost of schooling and
providing incentives for households to send their children to school. The rehabilitation of public
schools with deficient/poor quality infrastructure (again such schools are disproportionately

                                                     20
located in rural areas) under the district TOP program, the establishment of free private schools in
un/ underserved rural communities, and recruitment of new teachers (with a bias at the margin
towards female candidates) under merit and needs-based affirmative criteria and their local
assignment under school-specific contracts are likely to have contributed to increased enrollment
of children from poor and rural households. It is often assumed, at times documented, that girls’
school participation is more sensitive to distance to school, deficiencies in school infrastructure
such as the lack of toilets or boundary walls (for a sense of security), and the lack of female
teachers; the initiatives under SERP addressing these issues would likely have a larger impact on
girls’ school participation than boys’. As a result, PDO 2 aimed at reducing gender and rural-
urban disparities was achieved (see paragraph 3.2.8).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
3.5.2 The SEP implementation has resulted in significant institutional changes, and made
progress towards strengthening capacity for the longer-term development of the education sector
institutions, improving governance and institutionalizing accountability in education service
delivery. Examples of the main areas of improvements as well as of the challenges are listed
below.

    •   Fiscal sustainability and effectiveness and accountability of public expenditures have
        been enhanced with the approval of the medium-term fiscal framework, financial
        management reforms including resolution of outstanding unresolved audit observations,
        and procurement reforms (see paragraph 3.2.16).
    •   The project helped strengthen capacity of the ERU in the FD that assisted the education
        sector in budgets and releases, and effectively partnered with the RSU to improve the
        efficiency and effectiveness of public education expenditures.
    •   Progress was made towards building capacity of the RSU which has become the primary
        agency in the ED responsible for education policy formulation, coordination, monitoring
        and evaluation of the efforts under the SERP, donor coordination, and implementation of
        selected activities. However, frequent changes in key staff of the RSU affected its
        performance (paragraph 5.2.4).
    •   The Reform Steering Committee (RSC), composed of the highest ranking officials in the
        province and chaired by the Chief Secretary, to provide overall strategic guidance,
        interdepartmental coordination, and oversight support for SERP implementation could
        not meet regularly, mainly because of difficulties in convening meetings.
    •   The SEP laid good foundation to strengthen the weak capacity at the district and school
        level to strengthen education management, resource management, service delivery and
        monitoring and evaluation. This is an ongoing process and more needs to be done.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
3.5.3 Two positive outcomes are noted. First, the results based project design changed the
nature of dialogue from focusing on inputs to focusing on outcomes because the timing and
amount of disbursements were tied to the achievement of specified annual implementation
progress and performance targets or DLIs. Second, triggered by the Bank’s due diligence, the
concerted efforts of the RSU, FD and others in the GoS resulted in a sharp reduction in the
payment of salaries in cash to education sector employees through DDOs at the district level to
direct deposits into employees’ bank accounts, thereby reducing the significant risk of leakages.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

4.1      Key risks to development outcomes arise from the following: (i) continued political
instability in the province that could reduce GoS commitment to the education reform program
and lead to shifts in priorities; (ii) elections in 2013 and possibly a subsequent change in priorities
and interests by the new GoS; (iii) weak economic management, volatile security situation,
political uncertainty, and poor prospects can depress demand-side, and supply-side government
investments in education; (iv) continuation of reforms in particular concerning improvements in
the education system governance and strengthen accountability at all levels in order to improve
school performance and service delivery are likely to remain challenging in a weak governance
environment and resisted by status-quo proponents; and (v) despite progress in SEP, planning and
execution capacity remains weak across the provincial departments, sub-departments and other
entities of the ED and various administrative levels from the province to the school. However,
the GoS’s request for continued Bank support for its SERP II through a second SEP makes
continued delivery of improved education services likely.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
5.1.1 The Bank performance for ensuring quality at entry is rated satisfactory. As discussed
earlier (Section 3.1), the project development objectives were strongly relevant and remained
relevant throughout the project, and were aligned with the Bank’s CPS and the GoS’s priorities in
the education sector. Building on the engagement with the GoS, established during the previous
SEDPC in support of the SERP, the Bank team remained fully engaged with the GoS in the
design of the SEP including active policy dialogue; continuity in the Bank’s efforts was
facilitated by the same Task Team Leader for the SEDPC and for the SEP during its preparation
and appraisal. Throughout preparation, the Bank team consulted various stakeholders at all levels
in the province and districts, and took steps to reinforce ownership and active participation of the
GoS in project design. In consultation with the GoS, the SEP used a results-based design with
disbursements tied to the achievements of the agreed targets in the DLI matrix.

5.1.2 As noted in the PAD (pages 8-9) and in paragraph 2.1.2, the project design reflected the
lessons learned not only from the GoS’s own implementation experience including from the
SERP and SEDPC, and from Punjab which has been implementing its own education sector
reforms since 2003, but also from the experience of other countries and regions that were
implementing similar projects with similar instrument design, particularly in the LAC region. In
addition, the Bank team took into account the findings and recommendations from a range of
analytical and advisory work for Sindh as well as Pakistan, and broader international experience
in selecting interventions in the SEP design to simultaneously address the issues of school access
and quality of learning.

5.1.3     The SEP design also reinforced improvements in education system governance and
accountability in all interventions, and paid attention to reducing gender and rural-urban
disparities, and addressing social development aspects. The M&E arrangements were appropriate
and well integrated in the project design (Section 2.3); however, in hindsight, in view of the
concerns on the quality of the ASC data, it was premature to rely on data from the ASC for
tracking the progress on transition rate. The SEP design paid adequate attention to the fiduciary
assessment and arrangements to ensure compliance with the Bank’s relevant policies and
procedures. All significant risks, including weak implementation capacity, were recognized and


                                                  22
mitigation measures formulated. In addition, the SEP AF further aimed to intensify important
reforms (teacher rationalization across schools and preparation and management of school
specific budgets).

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
5.1.4 The Bank implementation support team was multi-disciplinary with a good skill mix with
specialists in education, poverty reduction and economic management, financial management,
procurement, social and environmental management, communications, and legal, complemented
by international and national consultants. The continuity of this cross-sectoral team throughout
the SEP starting from preparation to supervision was unusually remarkable and this contributed
during project implementation to (i) the focus on development objectives, (ii) the effectiveness of
the policy dialogue across the diverse reform programs with the higher level GoS officials and the
implementing agencies, and (iii) a speedy resolution of the implementation issues as they arose.
Close collaboration with GoS during preparation of the SEP and the SEP AF continued through
implementation and the Bank team continued to provide the necessary technical advice on
important policy and implementation issues.

5.1.5 The Bank team jointly with the EU and GoS reviewed project progress at least two times
per year, thereby also reducing the transaction cost to the GoS. The Bank and EU teams
collaborated actively throughout implementation aligning their technical inputs including the
support from their respective TA components. Continuous contact over emails and phone and
short missions with specific mission objectives mainly by Islamabad-based staff in between the
main missions helped maintain continuous program support to the implementing agencies.
During security incidents and resulting security restrictions on mission travel, the Bank team
relied on virtual discussions and reviews, contracted consultancy firms and contracted individual
consultants based in Karachi for project supervision and implementation support. However, visits
to districts and schools were limited to those which could be visited within the day long trips due
to the Bank’s security concerns; this gap was however compensated as needed by holding
discussions with, for example, PITE/BoC including PEACe/STBB officials, district education
officials, school teachers in Karachi as arranged by the RSU.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
5.1.6 The Bank’s overall performance is rated satisfactory, considering the above satisfactory
assessments in assuring quality at entry and quality of supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.1 The GoS’s ownership of and commitment to the project and to its successful
implementation to achieve development objectives was strong. The GoS’s attention to education
sector financing for the SERP programs supported by the SEP and SEP AF, despite the floods
and general efforts to address the effects of the floods, remained unabated. The GoS
demonstrated its strong commitment to the project’s development objectives by instituting several
politically difficult reforms such as the merit based, objective, and transparent recruitment and
needs-based placement of teachers in GoS schools, and the pilot program using public funds to
leverage the private sector to extend quality schooling to un/underserved communities
particularly in rural areas. The GoS also supported a structured program of diagnostic
assessments of student learning by PEACe. In addition to meeting the ten DLIs with three annual
targets for each DLI (30 DLI targets in total), the GoS thought of new reforms and introduced
them, leading to three new DLIs (with one annual target for each DLI) supported by the SEP AF.


                                                23
5.2.2 There were however a few areas where performance was wanting: (i) the RSC did not
meet as regularly as expected (paragraph 3.5.2), which at times delayed action on reforms such as
in steering the submission and approval of the Sindh Teacher Education Development Authority
(STEDA) Act (which was approved by the Assembly in May 2012 and is now waiting for the
Governor’s assent), (ii) frequent changes in the Secretary of Education affected continuity and
delayed implementation, (iii) coordination, collaboration and information sharing between the
various departments of the ED and across the provincial GoS involved in the reform program
outside of the Bank/EU joint review missions, and the internal impetus for collaboration were
missing, (iv) provincial government (Planning and Development, FD and AG) pressing the
districts to act would have helped ED/RSU to smoothen and accelerate implementation, and that
support was sometimes wanting. These other entities carry more clout than ED/RSU, and (v) at
times, funds were not released in full and on time. Some delays were due to bureaucratic delays,
some due to ED/RSU issues in providing the needed information, and some because the message
from government leadership to FD on release was missing. On the other hand, the GoS has
remained committed to the education sector reforms and is preparing its SERP II and has
requested Bank financing for the next project with design features similar to those of SEP.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.3 The ED and RSU demonstrated strong commitment and ownership to achieving the SEP
development objectives, and coordinated with the ED staff at the district and school level, and
other relevant entities (SEF, STBB, PITE, Bureau of Curriculum (BOC), and PEACe). The RSU
played a key role in the preparation and implementation of the reform programs supported by
SEP. As noted in paragraph 5.2.1, the ED and RSU instituted politically difficult reform
programs supported by the SEP. The RSU championed two new key reforms during
implementation with the SEP AF support, and introduced another new reform program for school
system consolidation; these reforms were not originally in SERP. The ED/RSU met all DLI
targets and only one DLI target needed a significant adjustment (the ASC in the M&E
subprogram in 2010/11). Satisfactory implementation of the reform program and meeting of the
DLIs were significant achievements. The ED/RSU also kept program implementation from
derailing despite shocks from floods.

5.2.4 The RSU had primary responsibility for conducting the ASC. Though the timeliness and
reliability of data improved during the SEP, the agenda remained largely incomplete (paragraph
2.3.4). Other parts of the M&E system including the TPVs and impact evaluations worked
satisfactorily to provide the required information for tracking progress of the DLIs and inform
decision making and performance monitoring. RSU generally complied with covenants 1 and
agreements and with the Bank’s fiduciary policies. The RSU also played a key role in
coordinating with donors including the EU. Staffing however in the RSU remained inadequate in
particular for procurement (consultancy services and contract management) and environment
management, and frequent turnover of GoS officers working at the RSU affected implementation
performance and oversight of the SEP. At times, payments in the ASC and student assessment
program under PEACe were delayed. Available project TA resources should have been used

  Covenants concerning the communication plan and its implementation, detailed inventory and
investigation report of new schools without the Sindh Education Management Information System
(SEMIS) codes, issuance of permanent, unique and fixed length SEMIS codes to existing government
schools, and the display by all government schools of their school names and SEMIS codes following
issued guidelines were only partially complied with; the reason being that the universe of government
schools is yet to be fully determined by GoS.



                                                    24
more by ED/RSU to support implementation capacity of districts. The most successful example
of support to the districts was the use of a third party construction supervision firm to support
districts, contractors, and schools with the effective implementation of the school rehabilitation
initiative.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.5 The overall performance of the Borrower is rated satisfactory, considering the above
assessments of the GoS (satisfactory) and the implementing agency performance (satisfactory) in
carrying out most reforms including politically difficult reform programs, giving unabated
attention to providing education sector financing, and keeping program implementation from
derailing despite the external shocks from two large scale floods in 2010 and 2011.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1       Significant lessons learned from the SEP’s experience are listed below.
•     A results-based investment operation that disburses against DLIs with predefined
      implementation progress and performance targets can be a good vehicle to influence
      medium-term reforms and performance outcomes such as improved sector governance and
      increased accountability, and help change the nature of the dialogue to focus on development
      outcomes. There was a large amount of “learning by doing? from the design and
      implementation experience of this first results-based education sector operation (along with a
      similar project in Punjab in Pakistan) in IDA countries on the Bank side and by the GoS, and
      the ICR team expects to see positive long-term benefits of this approach as more Bank staff
      and developing countries become conversant with the approach.
•     Strong political commitment and ownership are critical for successfully steering a sector-
      wide reform program and for addressing governance and accountability constraints to
      effective service delivery (e.g., approval of the policy and successful implementation of the
      merit based recruitment of teachers and their needs-based placement following objective and
      transparent criteria required the GoS to challenge vested interests and achieve a significant
      break from the patronage based teacher recruitment in the past).
•     Continuous and intensive Bank engagement across the reform program and technical and
      advisory support (to the line department and other related core departments at all levels
      including program and deputy program managers) can help keep momentum and provide the
      needed support at critical points. Joint preparation and implementation review missions by
      the Bank, the EU and the GoS contributed to the effective project implementation and
      minimized the transaction costs to the GoS.
•     Simultaneous focus in SEP on inputs and reforms to improve the quality of learning is likely
      to be more beneficial in meeting the school participation objectives of attracting and
      retaining both boys and girls in school.
•     A realistic assessment of the capacity is important to inform the design and sequencing of the
      reform programs for optimal impact (e.g., the design of the subprogram for strengthening
      district education management for service delivery proved optimistic during implementation
      and an incremental approach may have resulted in a more effective implementation).
•     Accountability based public subsidies to private entrepreneurs to set up and operate primary
      schools can serve as a major instrument for the GoS to provide quality schooling to
      un/underserved rural communities. The success of the PPRS pilot in the SEP is an example
      of how proper incentives and the power of accountability can help in transforming system
      performance.
•     Regular diagnostic assessments for tracking student achievement are good initial steps

    achieve intended improvements requires capacity for test design, test administration and
    analysis, and wide dissemination of the findings to key stakeholders and the public.
•   Availability of timely and reliable data is essential for choosing the results indicators to
    measure the achievement of the development objectives. In SEP, the ASC could not provide
    reliable data to meaningfully measure progress on the transition rate.
•   Maintenance of the RSC was an essential step to provide high-level oversight and inter-
    departmental coordination but such an effort by itself could not aid oversight of the reform
    implementation progress with sufficient regularity and closer to the ground. The high level
    RSC however needed to be active and should have been followed by working groups at the
    provincial level to guide and help resolve critical issues and by formal coordination and
    oversight arrangements at lower levels.
•   Inadequate staffing of the implementing agency and frequent changes in critical areas such
    as procurement and contract management, environment management, monitoring officers,
    and deputy program managers can affect project implementation.
•   Successful implementation relies on district performance which remained wanting during the
    SERP. The RSU made significant efforts to support the districts and take a considerable load
    off the districts. The efforts to improve district performance will need to be continued in
    SERP II. In addition, apart from the RSC, strong coordination between departments for
    pushing forward the reforms is essential for successful implementation.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
7.1.1 The Borrower’s assessment of the project is included in Annex 7. The ICR team’s
comments on the observations of the Borrower are given below.

•   The GoS has observed that there were complaints from communities and SMCs that the
    amount of the grant to the SMCs (PKR 22,000) for a primary school was not enough for
    larger primary schools with five rooms, and that slabs in the flat amounts can be introduced.
    The ICR team shares the view that needs of the schools vary with size. The amount of the
    grants to the SMCs in the future under SERP II should however also take into account the
    design of the school specific budgets reform program, and arrangements and controls on the
    use of the funds.
•   On the GoS’s comment that the impact of the pilot capacity building program on the SMCs
    was less because selected schools were scattered in 8 districts and the impact would have
    been greater if all schools within the randomly selected communities in 8 districts or 5,000
    schools have been selected within 2 districts only. The original design of the pilot was
    chosen jointly, and the ICR team agrees that in hindsight the pilot capacity building program
    would have likely had a greater impact if all schools (but limited to the desired number, i.e.,
    5,000) within a given village were chosen for the pilot.
•   The ICR team agrees that the assignment, by the construction supervision firm for the district
    TOP program, of two employees (one Assistant Resident Engineer and one Site Engineer) per
    district regardless of the size of the district is likely to have affected the effectiveness of the
    field supervision for the program in the largest districts. This and similar issues should be
    addressed in the proposed SEP II.
•   The GoS has observed that direct and closer interaction with the districts and schools was
    required to further tune-up the technical advice from the Bank. The ICR team feels that visits
    to districts and schools were limited to those which could be visited within the day long trips
    due to the Bank’s security concerns; this gap was however compensated as needed by holding
    discussions with, for example, PITE/BoC including PEACe/STBB officials, district education
    officials, school teachers in Karachi as arranged by the RSU.



                                                 26
•   On the GoS’s comment that the Bank should have had a procurement specialist dedicated to
    SERP only for better facilitation of the reform areas, the ICR team feels that the arrangements
    for the Bank’s procurement support in place for the SEP (the Senior Procurement Specialist,
    based in the Country Office in Islamabad, participating twice a year in joint review missions
    to discuss procurement aspects, visiting Karachi as needed between the formal supervision
    missions to help resolve procurement issues, providing advice on phone and through emails,
    and conducting procurement training) were generally adequate. Adequate number of
    experienced procurement staff in the RSU would have also helped.
•   On the GoS’s comment that strengthening of the Bank’s Country Office in support of the
    SERP could have been more helpful, the ICR team feels that the staffing was adequate for
    providing implementation support to the SEP. As shown in Annex 4, a Senior Education
    Specialist, a Public Sector Management/Governance Specialist, and Senior FM and
    Procurement Specialists were based in the Bank’s Country Office in Islamabad, and a
    Consultant was based in Karachi. These staff together with members of the Task Team based
    in Washington DC supported the SEP implementation.

7.1.2 The RSU reviewed the ICR and concurred with the assessment. No substantive issues
were raised (see Annex 7, page 57). The ICR team has taken into account the RSU’s comments
in the ICR. No comments were received from the ED, FD and P&D.

(b) Cofinanciers
7.2.1 The EU reviewed and concurred with the assessment (see Annex 8). No
substantive issues were raised.

  Notes:
      (1) USD million equivalent calculated using PKR or EUR exchange rate as at June 30 for each fiscal year.
          Discrepancies in figures may occur due to difference in exchange rate on actual day of disbursement.
      (2) EU financing estimate at appraisal calculated using EUR exchange rate as at April 30, 2009 (date of effective
          exchange rate in SEP PAD). TA amount includes TA disbursed before start of SEP duration (i.e. from March
          2007 onwards).
      (3) Appraisal estimate of Borrower financing differs from the amount in the SEP PAD as the EU financing at
          appraisal had been included under Borrower financing, and now in this table for the ICR, the EU financing is
          shown separately in both the appraisal and actual/latest estimates.
      (4) The RSU considers the actual costs for SERP to be likely underestimated because the accuracy of data
          submitted by the districts through PIFRA in FY12 may have been affected due to the changes caused by the
          repeal of the 2001 Local Government Ordinance in FY12.

 Sindh Education Sector Project (SEP) and Sindh Education Sector Project Additional Financing (SEP AF)
 Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) for SEP and SEP AF

 Overall Achievement:
  • All ten of the FY2008/09 DLIs in SEP were satisfactorily met by the GoS, including the Global DLI on merit
      and needs based teacher recruitment.
  • All ten of the FY2009/10 DLIs in SEP were satisfactorily met by the GoS, including the Global DLI on merit
      and needs based teacher recruitment; two DLIs -- fiscal and budget management and school management
      committees -- had lagged but were subsequently satisfactorily met in FY2010/11.
  • All ten of the FY2010/11 DLIs in SEP were satisfactorily met by the GoS, including the Global DLI on merit
      and needs based teacher recruitment; 2.5 DLIs -- fiscal and budget management, public- private partnership
      program under the SEF and Annual School Census (0.5 DLI) – had lagged beyond FY2010/11 but were
      satisfactorily met in FY2011/12. In the case of the Annual School Census DLI, GoS took remedial actions in
      FY2011/12 to improve the Annual School Census data quality for the FY2011/12 round.
  • All three of the DLIs for SEP AF were satisfactorily met by the GoS.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Approach at Appraisal

The main objectives of SERP were to increase school enrollment, retention, transition between levels, and
student learning. By having an impact on these indicators, it was hoped that the program would impact
the probability of a child completing different school levels, and this in turn, would yield gains in labor
earnings measured over the course of standard working life. The net effects of the program were
estimated as the incremental benefits accruing to a representative child (private returns to schooling) as a
result of the effects induced by the program.

A cost-benefit analysis of SERP using the present discounted value (PDV) method was carried out at
appraisal. The current and future economic benefits and costs incurred for a representative child age 5
(the official age for entering primary school in grade 1 at appraisal) given a projected average school
attainment profile when the child reaches age 18 were estimated for two cases: (1) without SERP, where
the projected average school attainment profile is identical to the average school attainment profile over a
recent period, and (2) with SERP, where essentially the projected average school attainment profile was
adjusted by raising the annualized growth rate in the probability of completing secondary school by 0.5%,
1% and 2% points for male-urban, female-urban, and female-rural population groups, while the negative
forecasted annualized change without SERP for the male-rural population group was reduced to zero.

The PDV of expected economic benefits of primary and secondary schooling were derived by estimating
real lifetime labor earnings based on age-earning profiles for 15-65 year olds. The PDV of expected
economic costs comprised both direct (public expenditures on public and primary schooling) and indirect
(forgone labor earnings of children age 10 and above) costs of attaining each school completion level.

Assumptions for Economic Analysis at Project Appraisal:

    •   Urbanization rate: The forecasted annualized urbanization rate was assumed to be equal to the
        annualized population urbanization rate over the period 1998/99-2005/06, which stood at 1.8%.
    •   Discount rate: The rate at which expected economic costs and benefits were discounted to the
        present period was assumed to be 5%. The Bank team used the trend in discount rates (State
        Bank of Pakistan) at the time of the appraisal to assess the appropriateness of the discount rate --
        the rate had remained below 5% from 2001-2007.
    •   Survival probabilities: Estimates of age group-specific adult mortality rates for women and men
        aged 15-49 years using Pakistan Demographic and Household Survey (2006-07) data were
        linearly extrapolated to impute survival rates for ages 50-64.
    •   Unpaid family workers: The age-education level-earnings profile of unpaid workers was
        artificially constructed by applying a reduction factor of 75% to the corresponding profiles for
        self-employed workers. For children ages 10+ a reduction factor of 50% was applied to unpaid
        child workers.
    •   Real annual earnings: The forecasted annual growth rates in real annual earnings in wage and
        self-employment were assumed to be equal to the annualized growth in real annual earnings in
        the respective employment type over the period 1998/99-2005/06 for workers ages 15-64. The
        growth rate for self-employment earnings was applied to the constructed earnings in unpaid
        employment.
    •   Schooling length: For each school completion level, the length was assumed to be equal to the
        modal number of grades completed—for children ages 16+ the modal grades completed were 0, 5


                                                    38
        and 10, corresponding to less than primary school completion, at most primary school
        completion, and at least secondary school completion, respectively.

Results of Economic Analysis at Appraisal

A cost benefit analysis of the SERP, undertaken by using the PDV method, suggests that the program
yields positive expected incremental net benefits under the base case as well as under most of the
alternative cases considered as part of a sensitivity analysis. Specifically, under the base case the net
present value of costs and benefits, discounted at 5%, was estimated at PKR 33,150 (2000-2001 PKR) per
child at project appraisal.

Economic Re-evaluation and Scope of Data Inputs:

The same model was re-estimated using the most recent databases available for post-completion
evaluation by comparing them with and without project scenarios.

Inputs: Data for the analysis, as was the case at appraisal, is largely obtained from province-
representative household sample surveys. The present values of key variables used in the cost benefit
analysis are estimated based on 2010-11 PSLM survey data which covered 19,622 households in Sindh.
For estimating changes in key variables over the recent past, estimates from the above survey data were
compared to estimates based on 2007/08 PSLM survey data which covered 3,765 households in Sindh.
Time-series data on expenditures and students in the Sindh public education system are obtained from
GoS sources.

Assumptions: To keep the base parameters similar to those used in the PAD, the same basic assumptions
for economic evaluation have been used, to the extent possible, as those used at appraisal. Key
assumptions are summarized below.

    •   Urbanization rate: The forecasted annualized urbanization rate is assumed to be equal to the
        annualized population urbanization rate over the period 2007/08-2010/11, which stands at 2.8%.
    •   Discount rate: The rate at which expected economic benefits and costs are discounted to the
        present period is assumed to be 10%--Pakistan deposit interest rates adjusted for inflation have



                                                   39
        remained above 10% over the period 2007-08 to 2010-11, and are expected to continue at this
        level over the long term.
    •   Real annual earnings: The annual growth rate in real annual earnings in wage and self-
        employment is assumed to be equal to the annualized growth in real annual earnings in the
        respective employment type over the period 2005/06-2010/11 for workers ages 15-64. Growth
        rate for self-employment earnings was applied to the constructed earnings in unpaid employment.
    •   Secondary school completion rates: With SERP annualized change in the probabilities of
        completing at least secondary school are 9.2%, 0.5%, 3%, and 2.4% points for the male-urban,
        female-urban, female-rural and male-rural population groups, respectively.
    •   Survival probabilities, age-earning profiles for unpaid family workers, and length of schooling
        for each completion level follow identical assumptions as at appraisal.

Re-evaluation Findings:

As was the case at appraisal, the economic benefits of schooling are estimated by using adult labor
earnings, and the economic costs of schooling are estimated by using schooling expenditures and, given
the context, forgone child labor earnings. The present discounted values of benefits and costs are
provided below.

Comparison:

At appraisal, the incremental net present benefit of the SERP was estimated at PKR 33,150 per child
using a discount rate of 5% (base case), and PKR 2,400 per child using a discount rate of 10% (sensitivity
analysis). As noted in the table, the ICR team estimates an incremental net present benefit for SERP of
PKR 130,500 per child using a discount rate of 5% and PKR 22,800 per child using a discount rate of
10%. In both cases, the estimates are higher than at appraisal. The ICR team prefers the estimate with
the 10% discount rate as, over the SEP period, interest rates stayed at 10% or more and these rates are
expected to remain high due to poor current and future macroeconomic conditions, resulting in significant
price increases.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR

Program Objectives, Design, Implementation & Performance Parameters:
Sindh Education Reform Program is a government initiative to bring-in qualitative changes in the
Education sector. This Program is supported by the World Bank and European Union during the period
June 2009 to June 2012.

a. KEY PROGRAM OBJECTIVES OF SERP-1: The basic objectives of the program SERP are:
   • To increase school participation
   • Reduce gender and rural-urban disparities in school participation
   • Increase progression
   • Improve the measurement of student learning
b. RESULTS: (Source: PSLM - 2007-08 & 2010-11
   (i) 59% Increase in total budget allocation for education.
   (ii) Increase in Net Enrolment Rate (NER) in Primary, Elementary and Secondary from baseline
           2007-08 is 51%, 18% and 11% to 52%, 19% and 11% respectively by 2010-2011.
   (iii) 3% increase in primary completion rate in government schools from 49% to 52%.
   (iv) A visible improvement in examination and assessment results.
c. PROGRAM DESIGN:
The program was designed in four pillars:
   1. Improving Fiscal Sustainability and Effectiveness of Public Education Expenditures.
   2. Improving Education Sector Management
   3. Improving Access to Quality School in Rural Areas for Girls
   4. Improving Quality of Teaching and Students Learning

In order to monitor and assess the progress towards achieving these objectives the World Bank and the
government agreed on a set of Disbursement Linked Indicators or DLI’s making the funding conditional
to the achievement of these DLIs. The progress on quantifiable indicators was measured using
independent evaluations by third parties besides government reports.

At the end of the project, E&L Department successfully achieved all 33 disbursement linked indicators
which was consequently appreciated & verified by the World Bank. However, progress towards achieving
the objectives remained moderate. It should also be noted that during the period province of Sindh
experienced natural calamity i.e. massive flooding twice, in consecutive years having caused serious
damages to every field in Sindh.
d. PERFORMANCE UNDER REFORM PROGRAM PILLARS
The brief overview of performance of the reform program pillars is discussed separately along with the
associated components.

PILLAR-1: IMPROVING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PUBLIC
EDUCATION EXPENDITURES.

    1. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM
Objectives:
Under the financial management objective the program was to improve fiscal sustainability and the
effectiveness of public education expenditure. The following were the objectives of this component
related to public finance:


                                                 45
i.      Improved budgetary processes to introduce medium term result based budgeting, and preparation of
        medium term fiscal and budget framework.
ii.     Enhance internal control and financial accountability in the education sector through resolution of
        Audit Para.
   Achievements:
   Before SERP –I, there were 7,679 audit paras outstanding in the Education Department. During the FY
   2009-10 RSU/ED was able to settle 2,413 audit paras against the target of 2,312. Thus it was able to settle
   overall 63% audit paras against the target of 60%. Likewise FY 2010-11 2,490 outstanding audit paras
   against the target of 2,350, were settled, an overall 64% settlement against the target of 60%. Previously
   around 23,000 employee of Education Department were drawing their salaries manually and there certain
   data error in payroll of education Department .During the SERP , RSU/Education Department was able
   to rectify errors in payroll data of Education Department in PIFRA system .Through greater collaboration
   with the Finance Department (FD),District Treasury Offices ,Accountant General Offices and PIFRA
   Directorate, RSU/Education Department was able to online salaries of around 21,000 education
   employees .Thus number of employees drawing their salaries through DDOs (manually ) was reduced
   from 23,000 to just 1,200 as on June 2012. This effort of education department was highly appreciated by
   the PIFRA Directorate and AG Offices at various forums. To further improve the internal controls and
   create awareness amongst the Drawing and Disbursement Officers (DDOs) of district education
   department an extensive capacity building workshops were conducted in 13 districts with the support of
   European Union (EU) and around 450 DDOs were trained. The School Specific Budgets under MTBF
   were prepared in 14 Districts during FY 2011-12 .The MTBF budget were prepared in 14 Districts as
   against target of 6 districts.
   Implementation & Operational Experience:
   Under SERP I, to improve budgetary processes, the Education Department has been preparing budgets
   under Medium Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF) since FY 2010-11. The budgets of all the provincial
   level organizations/units related to the education departments like Bureau of Curriculum (BOC), Sindh
   Text Book Board (STBB), Provincial Institute of Teacher Education (PITE) and other such sub-
   departments, including Reform Support Unit (RSU) and Sindh Education Reforms Program (SERP) are
   being prepared under Medium Term Budgetary Framework. SERP was to complement the overall Public
   Financial Management (PFM) to improve accountability for education sector expenditures. For that
   purpose, the World Bank desired better internal controls and financial accountability through settlement
   of advance audit paras. Government of Sindh wanted continued resolution of audit Paras for the sector,
   through continued improvements in internal controls and other preventive and systematic actions.

  PILLAR-2: IMPROVING EDUCATION SECTOR MANAGEMENT

      2. MONITORING AND EVALUATION – ANNUAL SCHOOL CENSUS
  Objectives:
    • Conduct Annual Institutional Census & Producing Educational Statistics of Sindh Province.
    • Reliable & Timely Information to Educational Researchers, Planners, Administrators & Donor
        agencies by providing readymade data for effective Education Planning and Management.
    • Develop Coordination with donors & other organizations intervening with Education Sector for
        reform purpose.
  Achievements & Implementation:
  The ASC 2009-10 was conducted in due time and the DLI was met. The ASC 2010-11 was conducted in
  due time (4 months) as targeted.
  The following confidence building measures (CBM) were agreed to make a case for the release of unmet
  DLI.
    1. A meeting by Senior Minister for Education over the TPV results & that was explained to all
        Concerned Officers:

                                                      46
  2. A summary letter to get S. Minister's permission for the written test and time-bound appointment of
      DO SEMIS officers (3 years). A letter sent to AG from Secretary Education requesting timely
      payments for ASC this year and acknowledgment from AG office to that effect.
  3. A standard 9 digit SEMIS code was awarded to all schools reported in ASC 2010-11, earlier the
      SEMIS code was not standardized.
  4. All the districts were asked to display new fixed length and old SEMIS code with Name at the door.
      Almost all the districts have displayed the SEMIS codes and they have also provided evidence of
      certificate of all schools and snapshots of nearly 10% school.
  5. A list of all new schools have been prepared and verified by the districts, all these schools will be
      awarded NEW SEMIS ID, as approved the Senior Minister for Education.
Operational Experiences:
ASC is the key intervention and is a complex process which requires lot of efforts. During the SERP
following main challenges were faced
  1. Shortage of Technical team at SEMIS/ RSU
  2. Capacity of existing Government officers posted at SEMIS wing / RSU
  3. Technical capacity of DO(SEMIS) at district level
  4. Overall capacity at field level (Supervisors for data collection, ADO for data usage and data
      accuracy)
  5. Data entry, Data Merging & Data Cleaning
  6. Unavailability of EMIS/ reporting module

     3. EDUCATION MANAGEMENT REFORM - EMR
Objectives:
The Government of Sindh (GoS) recognizes the strategic challenge of improving the quality of education
service delivery both at district and sub-district levels. Towards this end, the GoS has taken a strategic
initiative of introducing Education Management Reform program (EMR) in a phased approach, under the
on-going Sindh Education Reforms Program (SERP), mainly supported by the European Union (EU) and
the World Bank. The Design of Cluster Based Management Program under Education Management
Reform Program. Sindh has more than 18,000 (approx. 40%) are single/two teacher schools at primary
level.
Achievements:
Before the inception of program reforms, a baseline survey of 327 lead/guide schools was conducted to
identify the current situation of those schools. On the basis of baseline survey findings a quality assurance
model was developed to improve the overall teaching and learning environment of target school. Under
EMR-QA model school-based support was provided to 327 guide/lead schools and some empirical
evidences can be find which has helped in the overall improvement of teaching and learning
environments of those target school. Moreover more than 118 education managers were provided
institutionalized management course with the technical input of IBA-Sukkur.
Operational and Implementation Experiences:
The Cluster Based Management Model was piloted initially in Dadu, Mirpurkhas and Naushahro Feroze
tehsil of respective districts. The baseline survey of all guide schools was conducted to identify issues and
challenges of each guide schools. Before the end of pilot phase an evaluation study was conducted to
gauge the improvement of each guide school. Expansion of EMR Model in Fourteen Tehsils (Dadu,
Badin, Thatta, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Sanghar, Daur (Shaheed Benazirabad), Naushahro Feroze, FaizGanj
(Khairpur), Larkana, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Jacobabad, Kamber Shahdadkot) was implemented.

    4. TERMS OF PARTNERSHIP - ToP
Objectives:
The objectives of the Terms of the Partnership program were to rehabilitate existing schools of the Sindh
Province at the primary, elementary/middle and secondary levels by providing them complete buildings
(shelter less schools) and missing facilities such as Additional class room, toilet, boundary wall, water
and electricity.

                                                     47
Achievements:
An equal amount of 100(M) Rupees was given to each district for rehabilitating schools. Unlike that, the
funds for TOP-II, TOP-III and TOP-IV were allocated on the basis of performance cum need criteria. In
TOP-I phase, around 3000 schools were rehabilitated whereas around 2030 schools have been completed
in TOP-II and TOP-III phase of SERP whereas civil work on TOP-IV phase has just started in a few
districts of the Province.

 Total:              4829            2635           1783           852

Assessment of Design & Implementation:
For each district, two employees’ i.e. one ARE and one Site Engineer were placed by the Third Party
Engineering Firm. The result of such equal based appointment was that site inspection was not done
according to the size of the district. Hence quality was compromised by not having human resource in
accordance with the geographical size of the district. Actually the screening of the schools did not happen
keeping in view the future needs and the quality of the schools. In other words, the officials of the Third
Party certified only surface-level things and those which were inside the boundary wall. The districts at
the initial level did not accept the idea of involvement of third party in the engineering affairs.
Consequently a visible friction was witnessed between AREs and XENs. There was a lacking on RSU
part as well as it failed to send strong signals to districts whenever they were found lacking in the
resolution of such and other their internal issues. Those contractors who opt for ADP related schemes did
not learn much from the SERP concept of execution of schemes. If these contractors would have been
able to get something from the SERP model of Schools Rehabilitation within the districts, in order to get
even more better results in respect of quality of the schools.

    5. SCHOOL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE – SMC

Objectives:
• To improve enrollment and reduce dropout.
• To increase and protect school assets.
• To develop school improvement plan.
• Effective and efficient utilization of funds
• (i.e. government grant/community donation as per SMC guidelines)
• To check the attendance of teachers and students.
• To liaison with NGOs and Government offices for development of schools
Achievements:
Sindh has approximately 43,095 main & functional schools. Majority of bank’s accounts were dormant
and closed due to long non disbursement of SMC funds. It was the major achievement of SMC team that
40,462 bank accounts were made operative by mutual cooperation of State Bank, Regional Banks,
Districts and RSU. More than 5000 SMCs were trained by NGOs. Some NGOs also arranged the
meetings of communities. All 49,000 schools got guidelines in easy version in Urdu and Sindhi
languages. Two posters which were self-explanatory along with one SIP chart were also sent to every
school. This was the intensive awareness campaign. Data was validated in the form of 121 Taluka Master

Operational & Implementation Experience:
Before SERP I, the SMC funds were stopped due to non-transparency of utilization of the funds and lack
of capacity building of SMCs. Communities took it as positive step of Government, however various
complaints have been lodged from communities and SMCs that the meager amount of Rs 22,000 for
primary school was not enough for 5 roomed schools. Various slabs in flat rates can be introduced in this
regard. The capacity building component of SMC also reflect less impact in the field due to the scattered
schools in 8 districts. For intense impact, it may have been better to pick all schools within the randomly
selected communities within 8 districts or 5000 schools have been selected within 2 districts only.
Moreover, no secondary school was included in the sample. Female schools that need more capacity
building were out of sample.

    6. GIRL’S STIPEND PROGRAM

Objectives:
• Relieve parents from financial burden of educating their children
• Provide an incentive for girls to remain in school
• To increase and retain female participation in schools
Achievements:

Assessment of Design & Implementation:
It has been analyzed on the basis of last five years data that total girl’s enrollment has been increased
from 3% to 6% and varies from year to year. Total enrolment was 259,539 in 2007 and 415,868 in 2011-
12. Despite increase in total enrolment transition rate is not sufficiently increased as per expectations,
only 4 %to 5 %. There was significant year wise increase in beneficiaries and expenditure. The increased
Enrollment in 45 DSP Talukas is impressive and doubled in last five years. It was 24,236 in 2007 and
51,448 in 2011-12.

PILLAR-4: IMPROVING QUALITY OF TEACHING AND STUDENTS LEARNING

      7. MERIT BASED TEACHERS RECRUITMENT

Objectives:
i)       To improve the quality of education by merit based recruitment.
ii)      To appreciate appointment of local teachers introducing methodology of school - UC specific
         appointment of Primary School Teachers (PSTs), and Taluka specific appointment of JSTs.
iii)     To ensure placement of local highly qualified / professional teachers.
iv)       To reduce gender disparity.
Achievements:
It was first time in the province of Sindh, the teachers were recruited on merit basis. For Induction of
highly qualified and professional teachers in the stream, the method of gracing marks was introduced
covering various aspects such as high education, professional qualification, locality and gender etc.
Before start of the recruitment process, number of strategies was evolved at RSU level to facilitate other
stakeholder’s, including development of tools / templates and other relevant documents to carry out.
Implementation and operational experience:
The whole program was implemented in very efficient manner to some extent despite some bitter
experiences in some districts (Kamber Shahdadkot and Naushahro Feroze) where EDOEs violate the
guidelines of the department to meet their illicit motives and earned bad name for the department. The
officers were placed under suspension and enquiry was ordered against them by the department. The fate
of the officers will be decided after final recommendations of the enquiry committee and decision of cases
filed by the affected candidates against both officers. This paved way for meritorious candidates to lodge
protest and push department to face litigation in the courts of law. This also caused delay in recruitment
process in some districts. The entry of extra candidates in the stream as successful candidates also caused
great problems to carry out smooth operation of the program.

      8. TEACHERS EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT – CPD

Objectives:
Keeping in view the pre-SERP scenario, Government of Sindh decided to constitute a working group
involving the experts and intellectuals to frame rationalized recommendations for addressing the core
issues and challenges in enhancing the quality of teacher education in Sindh. The objectives of their task
were to;
    i.     Enhance quality of pre-service teacher training courses,
   ii.     Make in-service teacher trainings effective for development of skills and competencies of the
           teachers,
  iii.     Liaise in-service teacher trainings with promotions and career path of the teachers,
  iv.      Strengthen the teacher training institutes in human, capital and physical characteristics ,
   v.      Rationalize overlapping roles of apex organizations i.e. PITE and BoC,
  vi.      Design a mechanism for provision of equal opportunities of training for each teacher in Sindh.
Achievements:
• Rationalization of roles and responsibilities of the PITE and BoC: The roles of BoC and PITE
      have been rationalized and former performs the administrative role through its extension wing and the
      later, the role of Quality Assurance Agency. After 18th Amendment, the responsibility of
      administration of TEIs in Sindh needs to be rationalized
• Introduction of a new Initial Teacher Education (ITE) program by phasing out PTC and CT
      courses: A two year Associate Degree in Education (ADE) program leading to 4 year B.Ed. Honors
      Degree, was introduced as Initial Teacher Education (ITE). 12 (twelve) TEIs offers this ITE program
      from session 2012-13.


                                                    50
•    Introduction of Continuous Professional Development (CPD) framework: CPD framework is
     designed on accreditation and certification standards. It ensures that no sub-standard teacher
     development program would be offered for in-service trainings.
• Establishment of an institutional home/ focal point: Sindh Teacher Education Development
     Authority (STEDA) has been established for strategically managing the whole domain of teacher
     education and development in the province.
Operational and Implementation Experiment:
The outcome of the working group was a Teacher Education Development (TED) policy which was
approved in April, 2009 by the Government of Sindh. The policy mentions the proposals and its
associated institutional arrangements by focusing on following four domains in teacher education in the
province;
i.       Rationalization of roles and responsibilities of the PITE and BoC: The consultative meetings
         were done with both the organizations along with former heads of both the institutions to identify
         if they were performing their roles according to their essence of creation. It is hoped that all the
         interventions mentioned above would reflect both the organizations towards their original roles in
         near future. After clarifying roles of both the organizations, the responsibility of administration of
         TEIs in Sindh needs to be rationalized.
ii.      Introduction of a new Initial Teacher Education (ITE) program by phasing out PTC and
         CT courses: Higher Education Commission (HEC), in line with National Education Policy 2009,
         came out with an intervention in Initial Teacher Education (ITE) with an Associate Degree in
         Education (ADE) program leading to 4 year B.Ed. Honor’s degree. Government of Sindh, in
         consultation with World Bank, decided to adopt the intervention in the province.
iii.      Introduction of Continuous Professional Development (CPD) framework: CPD Framework
         was introduced for in-service training of the teachers and its relation to their career path. The
         framework provides equal and competitive opportunities to both public and private service
         providers to come up with standardized training programs.
iv.      Establishment of an institutional home/ focal point: The need of a regulatory body was
         emerged for strategically managing the whole domain of teacher education and development in
         the province.

Assessment of Design & Implementation:
PEACE, Sindh completed the SERP-I and produced two reports and broachers. The results of these tests
show that there is a need for improvements in teacher training and textbook development. Analysis and
reports of PEACE assessments of Mathematics and Languages in Grade IV for the financial year 2010 &
2011 could not be produced due to non-availability of local consultant and Data Analysis Expert.
Following are the strategies through which targets can be achieved;
• Working Groups to be functionalized to develop a mechanism for the concerned stakeholders to
    implement the finding of students learning achievement for improving the quality of education at
    school, district and provincial level.
• Additional meetings with district officers, teachers and parents.
• Conducting seminars, meetings and workshops to share the findings.

    10. FREE TEXT BOOKS – FTB

Objectives:
 • To increase the enrollment and overcome drop out ratio of school going children.
 • To attract the poor parents to send their children to school. (especially of rural areas)
 • To reduce the education cost.
 • To enhance literacy rate.
Achievements:

Assessment of Design & Implementation:
• Every year a cell comprising of three monitoring officers is established at RSU to examine the
   complaints received from the parents/teachers, in connection with text books delivery and to take
   remedial steps for redressal of their grievances, through different methods and monitoring tools.
• As soon as the process of text books delivery ended, the monitoring teams as well as the DPM (Text)
   himself proceeded to different districts of the province to conduct random visit in connection to
   ensure the text books are delivered to real beneficiaries within due course of time.
• The monitoring tools were developed at RSU before start of activity.
• First time a Proforma was developed to assess number of undistributed books lying in different
   Taluka warehouses and STBB warehouses.
• Due to effective and timely monitoring very small number of complaints were received at RSU from
   different corners.
• Demand of books / Enrollment is obtained from the districts on prescribed Proforma to place order
   for printing of books with the Sindh Text Book Board.
• The schedule regarding free text books distribution is issued to all districts of the province after due
   consultation with the Sindh Text Book Board.
• The School Directory, School Dispatch Forms and Taluka Dispatch Forms are being printed at RSU
   about a month earlier before start of the activity.
• At the time of delivery of Free Text Books the RSU assigns tasks of monitoring of the books
   distribution to its officers, who remain at the Warehouse until the last book is dispatched to the
   district concerned.

Additional Financing:
                                   SCHOOL SPECIFIC BUDGET
Objectives:
Objective is to introduce School Specific Budget with school specific non-transferable posts across all
districts to improve governance and accountability and ensure availability of adequate resources to each
school.
Achievements:
     1. Policy of school specific budget approved and notified.
     2. Software application prepared to support school specific budget 2011-12 preparation and training
         provided to districts government officials.
     3. To satisfy School Specific Budget Disbursement Link Indicator 6 district governments prepared
         School specific budget. In addition to that 8 more districts prepared budget for the FY 2011-12
     4. All 23 districts prepared school specific budget, approved and included in the budget book
         Volume-III for the financial year 2012-13.
     5. School Specific Budget Utilization framework for non-salary approved and circulated to
         concerned quarters.
 Assessment of Design & Implementation:
In the school specific budget management Finance Department, AG Sindh and District Account Offices
have very crucial rules and they are likely to affect and be affected by the proposed increased of school
level DDOs in budgets. Their better understanding of outcomes of the initiative was necessary to move in
the right directions. System limitations and capacity issues in ERU-FD prevented creation of primary,
middle and elementary schools DDOs in the system and making it extremely difficult to reach the
program objectives particularly aligning the teaching resources with the school size and non-salary
expenditure tracking.

Teacher’s Rationalization:
Objectives:
Objective is to rationalize teachers by of fixing teaching post in schools budgets according to teacher
rationalize policy of Education & Literacy Department.

                                                   53
Achievements:
   1. Teacher’s rationalization incorporated in the school Specific Budget Policy.
   2. To clear School specific budget Disbursement link indicator 6 district governments prepared
       School specific budget along with teaching post in primary schools. In addition to that 8 more
       districts prepared budget for the FY 2011-12.
   3. All 23 districts prepared school specific budget with sanctioned post for primary schools,
       approved and included in the budget book Volume-III for the financial year 2012-13.

Assessment of Design & Implementation:
School specific budgets along with teaching post for high and higher secondary schools were incorporated
in the Budget Books Volume-III as per prevailing practices. Since methods of teacher’s requirement
assessment particularly with respect to subject wise teaching and data on subject wise teachers was not
available, allocation of teaching post was not possible in post primary schools. Hence rationalized
allocation of teaching posts restricted to primary schools only.

PROMOTING PRIVATE SCHOOLING IN RURAL SINDH (inputs provided by the SEF)
1. Key Program Objectives:
 a.      Promote long-term public-private partnerships through providing per child fee subsidy to private
         schools sector in order to create greater access to education in marginalized areas of Sindh.
 b.      Enhance the quality of education and educational practices within classrooms thereby increasing
         student learning and achievement.
 c.      Reduce gender disparity in education.
         2. Achievements:
485 new private schools have been established in 10 districts of Sindh catering to the educational needs of
approximately 72,000 students. The schools were established through local entrepreneurs selected
through a comprehensive screening and selection process; these school operators were trained in school
management and school leadership and have been provided regular financial, technical and administrative
support. The entrepreneurs are provided funds to cover the school expenses; the amount of funds or
student subsidy provided to each school is determined based on critical indicators like student headcount,
overall performance and compliance to the key terms and conditions laid out in the partnership contract
signed with the entrepreneurs. In addition to financial support, technical support geared towards
educational quality enhancement at the school level included teachers’ professional development
including district based training programs, refreshers and learning support, provision of learning material,
free Oxford University Press Textbooks for each student, stationery and student bags, school monitoring
and student assessment. Around 1300 teachers, mostly females, were hired from within the community to
teach at these schools promoting employment and development opportunities for local women.

Operational and Implementation Experiences:
The challenges faced during project implementation included opening of new schools near government
schools owing to non- compliance of third party research firms, which were primarily responsible for the
survey, towards contractual obligations resulting in flawed site based verification. As a result around 70
schools had to be closed. Additionally, natural disasters i.e. flash floods and rains that hit the Province
during the course of project implementation resulted in mass migrations of the communities, damages to
the school infrastructure resulting in many schools becoming dysfunctional. Also, the project experiences
in terms of partnership with entrepreneurs point towards the need for further strengthening the selection
criteria of school entrepreneurs and introduction of academic qualification and relevant professional
experience may be considered as some of the key conditions for selection. Some entrepreneurs associated
with the program lack basic reading, writing and comprehension skills which cause huge problems vis-à-
vis understanding the terms and conditions of the contract as well as school based implementation of
project interventions.

Borrower’s Performance
(a) Performance of Government & Implementation Agency:
The role of government has been instrumental in implementation and getting the desired outcomes of the
project.

          The E& L Department was successful in completing all the Disbursement Linked Indicators
(DLIs) of the project including the Global DLI. It was not only successful in achieving the DLIs but was
also successful in getting almost 100% disbursements against the allocated amount of the project.
Moreover, it was also successful in getting the timely disbursement of all the funds under the project
agreement.
          Under the project distribution of funds to the districts under Terms of Partnership (TOP) were
made which helped the education department to allocate guaranteed funds to the District Education
Department to provide missing facilities and improve the school infrastructure. This was verified through
the third party validations conducted under TOP. The spending of the allocated funds was made under the
set plan. However, the link between the Annual Development Plan (ADP) and TOP was missing and
there is a larger need to build relationship between TOP and ADP to avoid duplications and get better
results.
          The government was successful in the payment of Stipends to the Girls and differential stipends
to some district in accordance with the project target .The veracity of the achievement has been checked
through third party validations. Thus, it was able to achieve the broader objective of the project related to
stipends. However, more needs to be focused on outcomes and improvement in payment methods is
required to further improve and facilitate the distribution of funds .
          The School Management Committees funds were successfully distributed getting the set targeted
results under the project. This has also been verified by the third party reports conducted in this regard.
But the basic purpose of involving the community under SMC needs to be improved and more focused
approach towards community participation and creating awareness amongst the community is needed.
          Another major achievement of the government has been allocation of funds for primary, middle
and elementary schools along with high schools under non-salary component in every district of Sindh.
Previously Primary, Middle and Elementary schools didn’t have any kind of non-salary budgets .The
government has been quite successful in designing the policies towards allocation of funds under School
Specific Budgets .There is a dire need for designing, implementation and monitoring framework for
School Specific Budget which would get desired results and set outcomes.
          Under the Medium Term Budgetary Framework, Performance based budget for education were
prepared in all districts of Sindh. Teacher Education mechanism has been significantly improved and a
regulation and monitoring body has been established. Sindh Teachers Development Authority (STEDA)
has been established through an Act of Parliament. The essential political will and commitment
successfully carried out Merit based Teacher Recruitment. This policy precedent will be helpful to
implement much needed hardcore reforms in phase of SERP.
          To improve the access, schools were established under Public Private Partnership the government
was not only successful in establishment of schools but was also able to sustain the system. Under
Provincial Education Assessment Center scheme quality assessment of students was conducted and the
same was verified through third party validations. The governance issues were resolved under the
Education Management Reforms (EMR) under the program. To improve the quality of management
district education managers were provided training under Sindh Education School Management program.
(b) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:
Rating: Satisfactory

                                                     55
The overall performance was satisfactory as all the DLI’s and Legal Covenants identified by World Bank
were met in the timely manner. The Technical Assistance is a major source through which the
Government of Sindh could achieve its objectives. It could improve the skills of the education department
to obtain the required level of skills for the implementation of all the reforms effectively. It is needed that
Technical Assistance must be utilized to its optimum level to achieve the desired outcome

Bank’s Performance
  1. Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
                Rating: Satisfactory
  2. Quality of Supervision
                Rating: Satisfactory
  3. Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Reform Support Unit kept close and continuous contact with the World Bank. The close coordination
    helped the implementation process significantly.
    However a strengthening resident mission of World Bank could have been more helpful. It is also felt
that procurement section of World Bank should have been dedicated to SERP only for better facilitation
of the key reform areas. The direct and closer interaction with the districts and schools is also required to
further tune-up the technical advice that we receive from World Bank. As per the spirit of the Paris
Declaration, European Union and World Bank joined hands. This step greatly reduced transaction cost for
the Government.

Institutional Arrangement for Sustainability of Reform Program:
Next Phase of Sindh Education Reform:
Successful implementation of first phase of Sindh Education Reform Program has provided insights and
lessons that are critical for the next phase. E&L Department is in an iterative process to identify the
reform areas.
Key Legal and Policy Developments:
After designing the SERP, some key legal and policy developments have taken place that has helped to
identify the reform direction.
18th Amendment in the Constitution of Pakistan:
The eighteenth amendment has changed the structure and requirements of education sector. The Sector
stands fully devolved to province. The significant change in post-devolution scenario has made E&LD
responsible to design and implement the curriculum. This change will have profound implications for the
designing process of next phase of reform

Compulsory Primary and Secondary Education:
Also, 18th amendment has made education compulsory for children between the ages of 5 to 16 years.
Provincial government is in process of drafting an Act to meet the constitutional requirement. It is
expected that next phase of reform will revolve around this constitutional requirement.
Identification of Reform Areas:
The fast pace change in social, political and legal environment will require quick and constant adjustment
of the reform design. Reform program of the government will remain an evolving enterprise. It is
expected that thematic areas for next phase of reform will be carefully identified to meet the
requirements. Government has initially identified reform areas on which threadbare discussion with the
development partners, various stakeholders, district administration and provincial departments pertaining
to different but relevant departments is on-going.

Borrower’s Comments on Draft ICR (received on December 17, 2012 from Saba Mushtaq, Deputy
Program Manager, RSU)

Dear Dhushyanth,

Many thanks for this draft report - it is extremely comprehensive and detailed, with useful
lessons learned for the Government of Sindh.

We agree with the comments/assessment of the Project Development Objectives and assessment
of PDO Indicator(s). We also agree with assessment of Intermediate Outcome Indicator(s) except
that the following at page iv & ix need to be explained:

Indicator 1- Fiscal and Budget management at page iv needs to be corrected as the payment in respect of
ASC and assessment was not delayed in 2010-11& 2011-12, however, PPRS got release in 2011-12 with
certain delays.

Indicator 13 - Achievement by 227% at page ix and also referred at page-15, para 3.2.6 need to be
substantiated with numbers for the common reader.

Indicator 15 - Achievement by 272% at page ix and also referred at page-16, para 3.2.10 need to
be substantiated with numbers for the common reader.

We have reservations about the strong wording used about RSU under 2.2(f) at page-8 which
could be revised to reflect the partial responsibility of the Bank also. This however, is
compensated in para 5.2.3 at page-24

The last component promoting private school in rural Sindh needs to be kept at page 54 after
teachers’ rationalization instead of page 56.

We appreciate very positive responses/comments reflected in Article-7, page-26 of the ICR by the Bank
on the issues raised by the Government of Sindh/Implementing Agencies and Partners.
We do not have any comments on the annexes of ICR.

These are the draft comments from RSU while the comments from ED, FD & P& D will be submitted on
Dec. 20.
