SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The proposed project is the second IDA financed project in support
of Tanzania's National Sites and Services Program. Like the currently on-going
first project (Credit 495-TA), it is aimed at enhancing the living conditions
of the urban poor through basic improvements in their environment and creation
of economic opportunities. The most important objectives underlying IDA sup-
port of Tanzania's urban sector are (a) to demonstrate a replicable approach
which responds effectively to the shelter and employment problems of the
urban poor and (b) to strengthen the institutional and financial capability
of Government to implement such an approach on a continuing basis.
ii.       Tanzania's cities are characterized by rapid population growth,
a deteriorating employment situation, and proliferation of inadequately
serviced squatter settlements. The urban population, currently growing at
an estimated 9% per annum, increased from 5% to about 9% of the national
total during 1967-76, with the bulk of the growth contributed by migrants
from the countryside. The economic situation of urban residents has been
worsening. Average household cash incomes in urban areas fell by about
50% between 1969 and 1976 as unemployment more than doubled to its present
level of about 17% of the urban labor force. The rapid growth of the cities
has not been planned or accompanied by a corresponding expansion of urban
services. Consequently, between 40 to 70% of the residents of Tanzania's
main towns are now living in uncontrolled, inadequately serviced squatter
settlements.
iii.      Prior to the adoption in 1972 of the National Site and Services
Program as official policy and the subsequent implementation of the program
with IDA assistance, little was done to improve the living conditions of
the urban poor. Government generally ignored the squatter population or
when political pressure mounted, razed specific squatter settlements and
relocated the residents. Low-cost housing programs sponsored by Government
were inadequate and, because of high standards, priced the poorer groups out
of public housing.
iv.       Under the first project, about 9,000 sites and services plots
and improvements affecting 9,000 houses in existing squatter settlements
are being provided to benefit approximately 160,000 low-income residents
in Dar es Salaam, Mwanza and Mbeya. The execution of the physical aspects
of the first project has been proceeding satisfactorily. There are, however,
deficiencies in the social aspects, financial management and cost recovery
arrangements in the project. The second project will address these defici-
encies in the context of broader, sector-wide policy measures.
v.        The project components to be financed under the proposed IDA credit
are:
(a) Squatter Upgrading: Provision of secure tenure and basic
urban infrastructure including water supply, drainage and
roads to about 16,000 houses in existing squatter neighborhoods;



- ii -
(b) Basic Surveyed Plots: Preparation of about 19,000 sur-
veyed plots in planned residential layouts to be allocated
to low-income applicants in the five towns;
(c) Community Facilities: Primary schools, health and nutrition
centers, and markets for each of the neighborhoods to be
upgraded;
(d) House Improvements and Construction Loans: Continuation
of the lending program established under the first project
for building materials loans for housing improvements in
upgrading areas and construction of new housing or surveyed
plots;
(e) Small-Scale Industry: An experimental program of assistance
to small-scale industries in Tabora and Tanga. The program
would provide infrastructure for industrial clusters, credit
for equipment, and management and technical assistance to
selected small enterprises;
(f) Equipment and Vehicles: Provision of the equipment and
vehicles needed for project implementation, the surveyed
plot program, maintenance and garbage collection; and
(g) Technical Assistance: Financing for consultants' services
for detailed engineering and construction supervision;
training of Tanzanian personnel in executing agencies;
management support; monitoring and evaluation of the project;
a study of pricing and taxation of land and shelter services
in urban areas; and preparation of a follow-up project.
vi.       The project has been designed with minimal standards that will
make it affordable by very low-income households. The estimated cost of
infrastructural improvements in the squatter upgrading areas is T Sh 3,500
(US$422) per plot. For surveyed plots, the cost per plot (including pre-
paration, surveying and provision of minimal access to water) is approximately
T Sh 210 (US$25). With household size averaging nine persons, the per capita
costs are approximately T Sh 390 (US$47) and T Sh 23 (US$3) respectively.
vii,      Based on preliminary engineering of the upgrading sites, total
project costs are estimated at T Sh 243 million (US$29.3 million) includ-
ing T Sh 6 million for land acquisition. The direct and indirect foreign
exchange content of the project cost will be approximately 36%. It is proposed
that IDA finance 70% of the cost of infrastructure and community facilities,
75% of the technical assistance costs and 100% of the costs for equipment,
vehicles and imported cement for THB's Materials Loans Program. The balance
would be financed by Government and THB. Accordingly, an IDA credit amounting
to T Sh 100 million (US$12 million) is recommended.



- iii -
viii.     The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (Ardhi) will
continue to be the principal executing agency, responsible for the infra-
structure works and day-to-day management of the national program. Ardhi will
be assisted in this task by the respective regional administrations and other
concerned ministries and parastatals. Ardhi's planning and execution capa-
bilities will be enhanced through actions agreed by Government as well as
technical assistance provided under the project. The Tanzania Housing Bank
(THB) and the Small Industries Development Organization (SIDO) which will be
responsible for the housing loans and small industries components will also
receive technical assistance support.
ix.       The project will be executed over four and a half years, 1977-1981.
Contracts for civil works totaling T Sh 59.7 million (US$7.2 million before
contingencies) will be awarded after international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank/IDA Guidelines for Procurement. Local contractors will
be allowed 7.5% preference over foreign bidders. Lesser works comprising
mainly community facilities worth about T Sh 7.8 million (US$0.95 million)
will be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding in accordance with
Government procedures acceptable to the Bank. Equipment, vehicles and cement
worth T Sh 16.6 million (US$2.0 million) will be procured according to Govern-
ment' s normal procedures acceptable to the Bank.
x.        The proposed project will benefit more than 315,000 low-income
urban dwellers (26% of Tanzania's urban population in 1976) providing
improvements to over 40% of the existing squatter houses and satisfying
75% of the need for new plots in five major towns. With the benefits being
provided under thd first project, the population affected would be some
475,000 people--almost 40% of the country's current urban population. Ex-
pected benefits of the project include (a) increased productivity resulting
from improvements in living conditions and health standards; (b) increased
employment; and (c) increased housing production. Technical assistance
provided under the project is expected to result in significant improvement
in public policies of urban taxation for land, shelter and infrastructure;
employment (through assistance to the urban informal sector); and health
(preventive health care and nutrition). The economic rate of return is
estimated at 23% for the squatter upgrading and surveyed plots programs.
xi.       The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$12 million on
standard IDA terms subject to conditions set forth in para 7.01.






TANZANIA
SECOND NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The project for which the Government of Tanzania is seeking an
IDA credit is the second phase of the National Sites and Services Program.
The first Tnase, involving new serviced plots and improvements in squatter
communities in Dar es Salaam and two regional centers, is being implemented
with the assistance of an IDA credit approved in 1974 (Credit 495-TA).
The second project will extend the program to four other regional centers
as well as to new sites in Dar es Salaam. The primary emphasis of the project
will be on upgrading; support will also be provided for surveying plots
which will be serviced as settlement occurs. Implementation capabilities
developed in the first project will be expanded and innovations introduced
in project design based on lessons of the first project.
1.02      The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (Ardhi) began
planning the project in 1975 using project preparation funds included in
the first credit. Missions visited Tanzania in March and July 1976 to assist
and review project preparation and in October 1976 to appraise the project.
This report is based on the findings of the appraisal mission consisting
of Messrs. P. Patel (Chief of Mission), C. Goldfinger, B. Rush, D. Coyaud,
and Ms. N. Barry (Bank), and Messrs. G. Hughes and F. Temple (Consultants).



II. BACKGROUND
A. The Urban Sector 1/
Urbanization Trends
2.01      Although one of the world's poorest, least urbanized countries,
Tanzania has been experiencing a rapid rate of urbanization. The urban
population is currently estimated to be growing at 9% per annum and the
proportion of the population living in urban centers increased from 5% in
1967 to about 9% in 1976. Both census and survey data indicate that the
rapid growth of Tanzania's towns has been the result of migration rather
than natural population increase. Dar es Salaam (590,000) is by far the
largest city in the country, followed by Tanga and Arusha (94,000 each).
Data on the growth of Tanzania's urban centers are presented in Annex 1
and their locations are indicated in Map IBRD 12572.
2.02      Unplanned squatter settlements have proliferated.  Official esti-
mates of the number of squatter houses in Dar es Salaam imply an average
annual increase of 16.6% during 1963-73 and a growth rate of 24% per annum
during the last half of the decade. Between 40% and 70% of the residents
of Tanzania's main towns now live in squatter settlements. Although these
settlements are not dense by international standards and much of the housing
is sound or improvable, the infrastructure in these communities is often
inadequate or completely lacking, and their residents have less access to
community facilities than other urban dwellers.
2.03      Another consequence of the rapid growth of Tanzania's towns has
been an increase in urban unemployment. Population growth has considerably
exceeded the creation of new employment opportunities. Regular wage employ-
ment, which accounted for just over two-thirds of the employment opportunities
in the urban sector in 1969, grew less than 6% a year during 1969-1976.
Average real earnings for this type of employment declined slightly during
this period. Informal opportunities (casual and self-employment) grew at some
11% per annum, but because low-income self-employment accounted for much of
the growth, average real earnings in this sector were more than halved. As
a result of these changes and growth in the labor force, average per capita
real earnings fell by about 50% during this period and unemployment rose from
approximately 8% to 17% of the labor force in urban areas. Furthermore, urban
dwellers' purchasing power has been sharply reduced by increases in producer
prices for key agricultural goods as well as inflation. Data for 1976 suggest
that between one-third and two-fifths of Tanzania's urban households have
cash incomes below the minimum wage of T Sh 380 (US$46) per month.
Urban Sector Initiatives During the 1970s
2.04      Tanzania's socialist strategy of economic development, articulated
in the 1967 Arusha Declaration, focuses primarily on agriculture and emphasizes
1/   More information on the sectoral background can be found in chapter II of
the appraisal of the first project (Report No. 337a-TA of May 12, 1974).



- 3 -
social equality and self-reliance. Implementation of this strategy has
led to more equitable income distribution but has also affected the overall
rate of economic growth. The villagization program contributed to a decline
in agricult:uzal production; commitment to costly social programs such as
universal water supply and universal primary education strained public re-
sources, while nationalization of key economic sectors limited the flow
of private investment funds. Administrative decentralization initiated in
1972 resulted in overextension of scarce administrative resources. These
difficulties were exacerbated by the global recession of 1974. Faced with the
economic crisis in 1974, the Tanzanian Government took a series of drastic
measures aimed at increasing agricultural production, reducing the growth
of recurrent expenditures, and freezing wages and salaries. As a result of
these measures, agricultural production increased and economic prospects
improved. Nevertheless, budgetary and manpower constraints on public policies
are likely to remain severe in the foreseeable future.
2.05      The national development strategy assigns low priority to urban
areas and the urban sector. Since a comprehensive urban policy has not as
yet been explicitly formulated, specific measures and initiatives affecting
the urban sector have evolved mainly as a result of broader policy actions.
Four aspects of the urban sector have been particularly affected: urban
rents and incomes; land development and housing programs; industrial and
administrative decentralization; and urban administration and finance.
2.06      Urban Rents and Incomes.  In order to reduce the gap between urban
wage earners and rural farmers, the Government has tried to restrain wage
increases for better-paid workers and raised producer prices for key cash
crops. As a part of this policy, since 1969 rents paid by public sector
employees living in publicly owned housing have been determined on the basis
of their incomes rather then the characteristics of the units. The policy has
had the effect of redistributing real incomes more equitably among public
sector employees. Since Government is the country's main employer, the policy
also has had a considerable impact on the urban income distribution. The
nationalization of rental buildings and the imposition of rent controls further
equalized the distribution of wealth in urban areas, but also discouraged new
private investment in construction and adequate maintenance of existing
buildings. As a result of pricing, income and taxation policies, the esti-
mated differential in consumption expenditure between the highest and lowest
paid public sector employees has been reduced from 60 to 1 at Independence
(1961) to 13 to 1 today.
2.07      Land Development and Housing Programs.  The Government's present
shelter policies 1/ emphasize improvement of existing squatter settlements
and development of new residential areas through surveyed plot programs. The

improvement program provides security of tenure in existing settlements and
basic environmental improvements. The surveyed plots program uses limited
capital resources to provide a planned context for self-help residential
construction, offering an affordable alternative to squatting. 1/ Although
no services (except minimal access to water) are provided initially, the
regional authorities are expected to respond to demands for services generated
by settlement on the plots.
2.08      Industrial and Administrative Decentralization.  The Second Develop-
ment Plan (1969-74) designated eight towns outside Dar es Salaam for preferen-
tial industrial development. The third plan (1975-80) currently under review
will emphasize the development of all 20 regional capitals. However, the
lack of transport and communication facilities in peripheral regions continues
to favor industrial location in established growth centers.
2.09      Administrative decentralization appears to have been more success-
ful. Initiated in 1972, it shifted 40% of the central establishment from
Dar es Salaam to the regions. In 1973, the Government decided to move the
national capital to Dodoma and the office of the Prime Minister has already
been transferred there. Given the huge investment required to develop access
and services infrastructure and the severe budgetary constraints, it is doubt-
ful whether the original construction program can be completed on schedule.
2.10      Urban Administration and Finance.  Far reaching changes in the
political-administrative structure have been introduced by the decentraliza-
tion reform of 1972. 2/ Independent local authorities were abolished and
replaced by districts and subdistricts grouped into regions. Although some
districts and subdistricts correspond roughly to urban areas, there is now no
urban government per se. While substantial decision-making powers were
transferred to the regions, the public finance system was centralized. Since
all fiscal revenues are now collected and decisions a-bout regional budgetary
allocations are made by the Treasury, the link between revenue collection and
expenditure in urban areas has been broken.
2.11      Tanzania's fiscal system uses taxation to redistribute income
between income groups and between rural and urban areas. The tax structure is
highly progressive and favors general rather than specific forms of taxation
in order to minimize differences in tax burdens due to location. An effort to
reduce the share of local taxation in total tax intake has been undertaken
since 1969. In line with its general policy, in 1974 Government abolished a
variety of local property taxes and rates, replacing them with a single levy,
the Land Rent and Service Charge. This is an annual charge equal to 10% of
the economic value of unimproved land as determined periodically by Ardhi
valuers (See para 4.08)
1/   Government owns the land needed for implementation of this program as a
result of the nationalization of land in 1963.
2/   For an extensive discussion of decentralization see Bank Report No. 587-TA
"Tanzania: Fiscal Aspects of Decentralization." (See also Annex 7).



- 5 -
2.12      Since the revenues from the Land Rent and Service Charge are not
earmarked for any specific use, their level is not determined by urban infra-
structure expenditure needs but by general budgetary considerations and
by the pace of Ardhi's valuation. The latter is slow, hampered by a lack
of resources and manpower and somewhat cumbersome valuation methods. There
are also delays in transmitting updated valution rolls from Ardhi to Treasury.
Furthermore, because of the equivocal wording of the Land Rent and Service
Charge Act of 1974, the charge has not been levied at all in squatter areas.
Consequently, the potential revenues of the charge are considerably under-
estimated. The collection of charges is poor: only slightly more than half
of the estimated revenues are being collected and arrears are large (see Annex
7).
2.13      While the 1972 reform specifically sought to transfer public ex-
penditures from urban to rural areas, its impact on the former was accentuated
by the general budgetary crisis and lower than expected yield of subsequently
introduced new levies such as the Land Rent and Service Charge. The result
was a heavy decline in the resources available to urban areas in absolute as
well as in real terms. The lack of funds for maintenance and new infrastruc-
ture investment caused a large-scale deterioration of urban infrastructure,
necessitating stop-gap remedial measures. Recently, for example, the Ministry
of Works had to undertake a large program (T Sh 25 million or US$3 million) of
road repairs in Dar es Salaam.
2.14      In recent months the Government has become increasingly aware of
the shortcomings of the present administrative and financial arrangements
for urban areas and the Economic Committee of the Cabinet (ECC) has initiated
a review intended to produce recommendations to alleviate the problems con-
fronting the towns. As a part of the review, Ardhi has undertaken a study
of the Land Rent and Service Charge to be financed under the project which
will produce recommendations for improving the policy of taxation of urban
land, shelter and infrastructure (para 2.21 and 4.08-4.09).
B. The National Sites and Services Program
Review of the First Project
2.15      The performance of Bank projects in Tanzania has been uneven,
hampered by shortage of local administrative and technical manpower and severe
budgetary constraints. Given this context, the performance of the first
project has been adequate and in many respects quite satisfactory. A workable
approach to low-cost, low-standard shelter has been developed. The execution
of physical infrastructure for the sites and services and squatter upgrading
areas has been carried out on schedule. The design and implementation capa-
bility of Ardhi has been strengthened. In the second project, this approach
will be continued and the scope of the project will be expanded to include
employment and income generation for poor urban dwellers. The design of spe-
cific project components will be modififed to overcome deficiencies. To assist
Ardhi, greater emphasis will be given to the financial management and social



aspects of project implementation, where problems were encountered in the
first project. The issue of plot charges will be addressed in a broader
context of public policies of taxation of urban land, shelter and infras-
tructure.
2.16      The composition of the second project will emphasize squatter
upgrading and provision of surveyed rather than serviced plots. This will
permit extension of the benefits of the project to a larger number of house-
holds in more towns so that more families in lower income groups can be
reached. The proposed project will benefit almost twice as many people as
the first project, although infrastructure expenditures in the two projects
will be approximately equal in real terms.
2.17      The standards for the education and health community facilitites
originally planned for the first project were higher than facilities currently
being provided elsewhere. In the second project, plans for the construction
of community education centers, including workshops, assembly hall and dis-
pensary as well as classroom, have been revised and emphasis is being given
to the provision of classrooms (para 3.08). Medical facilities in the first
project have high capital and recurrent costs and reinforce the emphasis
traditonally given to curative care in Tanzania's urban areas. The proposed
project will emphasize preventive care at Mother and Child Health Clinics
(MCHs) and support an MCH extension program focused on nutrition and environ-
mental sanitation (see para 3.09).
2.18      Early experience with house construction and improvement loans
indicated that prdject allotees were discouraged by THB's application pro-
cedures and fees and that THB was reluctant to incur the risks associated
with lending to relatively poor households with informal sources of income.
To reduce bureaucratic barriers to lending THB agreed to open part-time
offices in project areas and to reduce valuation fees for project applicants.
Furthermore, in order to make loans accessible to applicants from upgrading
areas, THB has begun applying lending procedures used in its rural operations
which do not require mortgages as security. Another problem confronting pros-
pective low-income households desiring to build or improve their houses is
limited access to building materials, particularly cement, at reasonable
prices. In the second project materials supply through on-site depots will be
introduced to complement cash lending (see para 3.10-12).
2.19      Implementation of the first project was handled by Ardhi's Sites
and Services Section in collaboration with regional administrations. In
the second project, this arrangement will be continued and an effort will
be made to improve specific aspects of implementation. The financial man-
agement capability of Ardhi will be strengthened and more emphasis will be
given to social aspects of project implementation, particularly in community
development and assistance to project beneficiaries. A more formal, system-
atic approach to coordination between Ardhi, regional administration and
local project management will be introduced (see para 5.02-5.08).



2.20      Cost recovery has been a critical problem in the first project.
At the time of appraisal of that project Government did not have any coherent
policies or guidelines on cost recovery that could be reconciled with the
Bank's requirements. A special formula was therefore worked out to be applied
exclusively to project areas. Charges calculated according to this formula
were intended to recover the full costs of on-site infrastructure over 25
years at 9% interest. This proved difficult to implement because the level of
charges set by the formula were much higher than in comparably serviced
adjacent areas where plot charges are grossly under-assessed by the Land Rent
and Service Charge Act of 1974 (para 2.11). This situation resulted in
political controversy and allottees refused to pay the fees required to obtain
title to their plots. The Government therefore requested an amendment of the
credit agreement in order to bring charges for project areas within the
purview of the Land Rent and Service Charge Act. Plot charges resulting from
this amendment will allow recovery of 75% of the capital costs assignable to
project beneficiaries amortized over 25 years at 9% interest. The proposed
amendment was approved by IDA in February 1977 (see Annex 7).
2.21      In the second project, the question of plot charges will be addressed
in the broader, sectoral context of a review of fiscal policies toward urban
land, shelter and infrastructure. A reform of the Land Rent and Service Charge
will be undertaken to improve its effectiveness, equity and yield. The long-
term goal of the reform will be to increase the revenues from the urban sector
to a level that would cover investment and operating expenditures for urban
infrastructure. An in-depth study of the Land Rent and Service Charge was
initiated in February 1977. At negotiations the inception report of the study
was reviewed and short-term measures as well as guiding principles for the re-
form of the Land Rent and Service Charge were agreed upon (see para 4.08-4.11).
Selection of Project Towns
2.22      The first project included components in Dar es Salaam and two
up-country towns, Mwanza and Mbeya. Ardhi's principal criteria in selecting
towns for the second project were the magnitude of the squatter settlements
and demand for plots as determined by the number of applications at the
District Land Offices. Other factors such as potential compensation costs for
displaced squatters, direct requests from regions, geographical balance and
availability of assistance from other sources were also given consideration.
2.23      On the basis of Ardhi's recommendations, Dar es Salaam and four
more up-country towns are included in the second project: Tanga, Morogoro,
Tabora and Iringa. The five towns had an estimated combined population
of 860,000 in 1976, 60% of the total urban population of Tanzania. The number
of squatter houses in these towns is estimated at 51,500, about 73% of the
estimated national total of urban squatter housing. The two projects will
serve seven of the ten largest urban centers in mainland Tanzania, containing
70% of the national urban population and 84% of the squatter housing.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The project will continue IDA assistance to Tanzania's urban sector
started under the National Sites and Services Project (Credit 495-TA). Based
on the experience gained in the first project, this project will provide
financial and technical support necessary for the implementation of the
country's National Site and Services Program over the next four years (1977-
1981). The most important objectives underlying IDA assistance to Tanzania's
urban sector are: (i) to demonstrate a replicable approach which responds
effectively to the problems of improving existing slums and controlling rapid
new growth; and (ii) to strengthen the institutional and financial capability
of the Government to implement such an approach.
3.02      The project will provide basic infrastructure and community facil-
ities to 160,000 low-income residents of eleven squatter areas in five towns.
The program of surveyed plots for low-income housing will provide about 19,000
plots satisfying 75% of the estimated five-year demand for new plots in
project towns. House improvement and construction loans, on-site technical
assistance for self-help housing consolidation and support for community
development will complement the provision of infrastructure and community
facilities. The project will also initiate a pilot program of assistance to
small-scale industry in the urban informal sector. Technical assistance
provided under the project will support detailed engineering and construction
supervision; training of Tanzanian personnel; management support for the
implementing agencies; preparation of a follow-up project; and monitoring and
evaluation. Assistance will also be provided to Government's efforts to
rationalize its policies of taxation of urban land, shelter and infrastructure
and to increase its revenues from the Land Rent and Service Charge.
B. Main Components
3.03      The project comprises the following interrelated components in
Dar es Salaam, Tanga, Tabora, Morogoro and Iringa:
(a)  Squatter Upgrading:  Provision of secure tenure and basic
urban infrastructure including water supply, drainage,
footpaths, roads and street lighting to about 15,800
houses in existing squatter neighborhoods;
(b)  Surveyed Plots:  Preparation of about 19,000 surveyed plots
in planned residential layouts to be allocated with legal
titles to low-income applicants in the five towns;
(c)  Community Facilities:  Provision of community facilities in-
cluding primary schools, health centers, and markets to the
upgraded neighborhoods;



- 9 -
(d) House Improvement and Construction Loans: Assistance
to the THB for continuation and improvement of the lending
program established under the first project for building
materials for self-help housing improvements in upgrading
areas, construction of new housing on surveyed plots, and
construction of worksheds for the small-scale industry
program;
(e) Small-Scale Industry: An experimental program of assistance
to existing and new small-scale industries in Tabora and
Tanga. The program would provide serviced sites for about
150 workshops, credit for equipment and technical assistance
to selected small enterprises, cooperatives and artisans;
(f) Equipment and Vehicles: Provision of the equipment and
vehicles needed for project implementation, the surveyed
plot program, maintenance and garbage collection; and
(g) Technical assistance: Financing for consultants' services
for detailed engineering and construction supervision;
training of Tanzanian personnel in executing agencies;
management support; monitoring and evaluation of the project;
a study of pricing and taxation of land and shelter services
in urban areas; and preparation of a follow-up project.
C. Detailed Features
Squatter Upgrading
3.04      A simple and inexpensive approach to infrastructure upgrading,
developed and tested under the first project, will be applied in the proposed
project with appropriate modifications. Selection of viable neighborhoods
was determined by several criteria such as location, economic and transport
linkages, technical feasibility and need for services (see Annex 6). The
sites selected for upgrading are identified on maps of each project town (see
Maps IBRD 12573-7).
3.05      Functional standards for infrastructure, described in Annex 6, are
as low as possible initially so that the per family costs can be afforded
by households at the lower end of the income scale (see Annex 6, Table 4).
However, provision is made in the planning for future upgrading of standards
as household incomes increase. Layouts and preliminary engineering for all
sites have been completed by consultants (see IBRD Map 12595 and Annex 6,
Table 5, for typical examples). Each site will have a network of collector,
primary, secondary and pedestrian roads. Collector roads will be macadam sur-
faced, as required for bus traffic, whereas primary roads will be gravelled,
providing vehicular access to the neighborhoods. Secondary and pedestrian
roads servicing inner areas will be compacted dirt roads. Carriage-way widths
on the surfaced roads will be kept to a minimum, although the rights-of-way



- 10 -
will be wider for future upgrading. Water kiosks with two or four standpipes
will provide one standpipe for every 50-70 houses within a maximum walking
distance of 250 m. Sewage disposal will be provided by owner-installed tra-
ditional pit latrines where soil conditions permit. Where groundwater condi-
tions are unsuitable, house owners will be provided technical assistance and
TUB loans to install alternative drycell systems. The initial power distri-
bution system will provide street lighting on the main roads and electricity
for the community facilities and small industries workshops. The drainage
system, designed to carry storm water and domestic waste water other than from
latrines, consists of open earth ditches along roads. Garbage disposal serv-
ice will be provided in the Dar es Salaam sites (where the problem is most
acute) by trucks financed under the credit.
Surveyed Plots
3.06      Under the program for providing new plots for low-income housing
Ardhi will prepare sufficient surveyed sites to satisfy 75% of the estimated
demand in the five towns (see Annex 1). The sequence of planning and imple-
mentation of the program would be as follows:
(a) site selection (see Annex 6 for criteria);
(b)  layout design (see Annex 6 for criteria);
(c) site clearance and surveying of plots;
(d) installation of skeletal water supply through standpipes;
(e) allocation of plots (see Annex 5 for criteria);
(f) settlement and house construction by allottees; and
(g) provision and upgrading of basic infrastructure in
stages.
Financial and technical assistance for (a) - (f) will be included under
the project; (g) would be initiated by residents with assistance from regional
authorities and Ardhi.
3.07      The layouts for surveyed sites will be designed for the same even-
tual standards as serviced sites (Annex 6), but unlike the typical sites and
services project, all on-site services except water supply will not be sup-
plied until after settlement has occurred. This approach will enable the
project to reach a greater proportion of the target population because of the
lower initial capital requirements. It affords one of the few practical
options available for policy action before squatting occurs.



- 11 -
Community Facilities
3.08      In each of the communities to be upgraded a careful evaluation
of the needs for community facilities over and above those existing was
made to determine the range and number of facilities to be included under
the project. The criteria used in the evaluation are discussed in Annex
2 and standards and cost estimates are shown in Annex 6. Twelve primary
schools will be constructed to meet the needs of project areas in conformity
with Tanzania's program of universal primary education. The schools will be
built to minimum standards and provide only classrooms in view of the severe
problem of recurrent financing and stated preference of local education
officers.
3.09      Health facilities under the second project will be designed with
a greater emphasis on preventive care and will focus on the groups most in
need of it: mothers and small children. Two new Mother and Child Health
Clinics (MCHs) and a medical outpost will be constructed and three existing
MCHs upgraded. The Ministry of Health will prepare guidelines to develop
an urban MCH program similar to the existing MCH program for rural areas.
Particular attention will be given to extension work in which nutrition
officers and nurses will visit the homes of families with malnourished
children and give courses in the community on nutrition and environmental
sanitation. The Tanzanian maternal and child health care program includes
pre- and post-natal care for the mother, immunization services, and child
spacing advice and services.
House Improvement and Construction Loans
3.10      The Tanzania Housing Bank (THB) will continue its lending program
for house improvement (in upgrading areas) and low-cost housing construction
(in overspill and surveyed plot areas) under the second project. The program
will incorporate modifications designed to address two major problems encoun-
tered in the first project: (i) availability of key building materials
to project beneficiaries; and (ii) access to credit for squatter inhabitants.
3.11      In order to improve the access to and supply of building materials
to project beneficiaries, THB will establish on-site offices and materials
depots. Critical building materials including cement, corrugated iron roofing
sheets and joinery will be stocked at the depots by THB. Most of the materials
will be purchased locally by THB using its own resources. However, due to a
severe shortage, cement will be imported until 1980 when two new cement plants
in Tanzania should start production. Foreign exchange required for importing
cement for the first three years is therefore included in the project. In
order to minimize dependence on imported materials new building materials and
techniques will be introduced through demonstration houses (see Annex 3,
Figure 3, for alternative housetypes to be developed).
3.12      In order to encourage lending in squatter areas THB will step up
publicity on the availability of loans in project areas and establish on-site
offices for distribution and collection of application forms. Furthermore,
lending criteria and procedures will be less stringent than those normally
employed by THB (see para 5.12).



- 12 -
3.13      Materials loans averaging T Sh 4,000 (US$482) for house improvements
in upgrading areas and T Sh 13,000 (US$1,556) for construction of new houses
in surveyed plot areas will be offered to project participants (see para 4.05
for terms). Borrowers will have the option of taking their loans in cash
and/or vouchers redeemable at THB materials depots on project sites. In
addition, loans for construction of worksheds up to T Sh 120,000 (US$14,500)
will be offered to participants in the small-scale industry program in Tanga
and Tabora. THB will finance about 90% of the projected lending out of its
own resources (see Annex 3, para 15). Consequently, the Government and IDA
contributions in this component are marginal and directed at special problems:
about US$1,075,000 for importation of cement, loans for worksheds, development
and construction of demonstration houses and staff training and equipment
necessary to operate the lending program effectively.
Small-Scale Industry
3.14      The Small Industries Development Organization (SIDO) will administer
the experimental program of assistance to the informal sector in Tabora
and Tanga included in the project. The program, described in detail in Annex
4, will comprise three major elements:
(a) expansion of SIDO's management training and technical
assistance program at the regional level;
(b) financing of SIDO's hire-purchase program for production
equipment and critical raw materials for industries
selected under the project; and
(c) infrastructure for industrial clusters (to be provided by Ardhi)
and provision of THB loans for building about 150 workshops and
sheds.
3.15      The basic objective of this component is to increase the economic
and employment potential of the project areas and to diversify their economic
base. To accomplish this, the program will build upon existing technical and
marketing skills in the informal sector. The program will provide its partici-
pants with (i) assistance in management, accounting, marketing and quality
control in order to help them expand their productive and marketing capabil-
ities; and (ii) specialization and diversification opportunities through
supply of new equipment. A preliminary list of new product lines to be
supported by the project has been established. 1/ Their selection was based
on an analysis of local raw materials resources, technical skills of the
target groups and demand potential within the region. Particular emphasis
was placed on strengthening industries that would serve surrounding rural
areas and on developing the building materials industry.
1/   This list will be revised on the basis of more detailed feasibility
studies to be conducted by SIDO (see Annex 4, paras 6-7, and Table 1 and
2). By September 30, 1977, SIDO will prepare at least ten feasibility
studies for review by IDA.



- 13 -
3.16      Grouping of existing enttepreneurs into larger cooperatives to
facilitate bulk purchase of in?pts, isternaZ. opecialization and joint market-
ing will be encouraged. Industries that wouid benefit from concentration
of production facilities and requiring large energy and water inputs will
be encouraged to relocate in clusters near the project area. The project
will finance basic infrastructure for the clusters and construction of sheds
and worksheds (through THB). Low-cost building technique will be encouraged
to minimize the repayment burden.
Technical Assistance
3.17      The project provides the following technical assistance:
(a) consultants' services to Ardhi for (i) detailed engineer-
ing and design for the upgrading projects; (ii) tendering
and supervision of infrastructure; and (iii) on-the-job
training of engineering assistants;
(b) eight man-years of management support services to Ardhi
including financial management (Financial Analyst), pre-
paration of management manual (Management Specialist),
community development (Community Development Specialist),
training (Engineering Instructor) and monitoring and
evaluation (Researcher);
(c) five man-years to SIDO for project implementation,
management training and preparation of operating manual
(Project Technical Adviser); and marketing and subproject
preparation (Specialist);
(d) three man-months of management support for THB to assist
in developing procedures for implementing the materials
lending program (Procurement Consultant);
(e) eighteen man-months of consultants' services for con-
ducting a study of the Land Rent and Service Charge; and
(f) six man-years of consultants' services for the preparation
of future projects.
3.18      To the extent possible, the use of local consultants from within
Eastern Africa will be encouraged. At least 30% of the technical assistance
needs are expected to be met through local consultants. However, provision is
made in the project to cover potential foreign exchange costs of expatriate
consultants.
3.19      Annex 8 contains a detailed breakdown of the technical assistance
included in the project. During negotiations assurances were obtained that
consultants to be employed would be acceptable to IDA and would be retained on
terms and conditions satisfactory to it.



- 14 -
D. Implementing Schedule
3.20      Overall project implementation will take about four years (see
Chart 1). Detailed design and engineering will begin in the third quarter
of 1977. Upgrading works are expected to be completed by mid-1979. The
target for the surveyed plot program would be reached by mid-1980. All other
construction components fall within this timetable. THB's lending program
and project monitoring, both on-going activities, will not require IDA dis-
bursements after December 1981. Accordingly, the project's closing date
will be December 31, 1981. A Project Completion Report will be submitted
to IDA within three months of the closing date (see Annex 10).

IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND COST RECOVERY
A. Cost Estimates
4.01      The project cost is estimated at T Sh 243 million (US$29.3 mil-
lion), of which about 36% are foreign exchange costs. The cost estimates
are detailed in Annex 6 and summarized in the table on the next page.
4.02      All costs are expressed in mid-1977 prices.  Cost estimates for
the infrastructure component are based on preliminary engineering designs
by consultants (Messrs. J. Burrows and Partners) and include a location
allowance for upcountry civil works. 1/ Other costs are appraisal mission
estimates based on data provided by the agencies concerned. Physical con-
tingencies of 15% on civil works have been included for infrastructure,
community facilities and demonstration houses. In accordance with Bank
guidelines, price escalation for civil works is based on estimated inflation
rates of 10% in 1976 and 9% in 1977, 1978, and 1979. Price escalation for
equipment and services is based on estimated inflation rates of 8% in 1976
and 7.5% in 1977, 1978, and 1979.
4.03      Equipment and materials imported directly for the project are
assumed exempt from custom duties and taxes. However, some equipment and
materials will be purchased in the local market and hence would be taxed.
The import duties and sales taxes for locally purchased materials and
equipment are estimated at T Sh 5 million (US$0.6 million) or 2% of the
total project cost.
B. Financing
4.04      Of total estimate project costs, about 40% would be financed with
proceeds from the proposed IDA credit of US$12 million to cover 100% of the
foreign exchange costs as well as approximately 5% of local costs. The bal-
ance of T Sh 143.4 million (US$17.3 million) would be financed by Government,
of which T Sh 39 million (US$4.7 million) will be from its normal budgetary
1/   To account for the additional transportation costs and difficult working
conditions compared to Dar es Salaam (see Annex 6).

4.05      The Borrower will be the Government of Tanzania which will pass on
the proceeds of the proposed IDA credit to Ardhi, THB and SIDO for their
respective project components through arrangements acceptable to IDA. For
Ardhi, Treasury will channel funds for the project through Government's normal
budgetary procedures as in the first project. Ardhi in turn will make
funds available to agencies other than THB and SIDO involved in implementation
of sub-components (see para 5.01). The arrangements for channeling funds were
finalized during negotiations. For THB and SIDO the terms will be as follows:
(a) THB. The funds for purchase of imported cement and workshop
loans will be on-lent to THB at 3% interest over 20 years
including a five year grace period. THB's terms to bene-
ficiaries of materials loans for housing will be at 6%
interest up to 20 years with a 1 year grace period, in ac-
cordance with current terms for such loans. Workshop loans
will be at 8% over 15 years with up to 2 years grace period.
Staff development and training expenditures will be made
available to THB as a Government contribution.
(b) SIDO. The funds for the hire purchase program will be
on-lent to SIDO at 3% interest over ten years including
a three year grace period. SIDO will recover the funds
from project beneficiaries at 8% interest over eight years
with up to two years grace period. SIDO's current rate of
interest for the program is 5%. The proposed increase
will bring the rate in line with the interest rate struc-
ture of the National Bank of Commerce (NBC), the main
source of working capital credit to small-scale industry.
This increase in interest rate was confirmed during
negotiations. Funds for management training and assis-
tance will be provided to SIDO through usual budgetary
procedures, while funds for infrastructure for industrial
clusters will be channeled through Ardhi.
4.06      THB will use its own funds to finance the balance of the lending
program for house improvement and construction totalling (before contingen-
cies) approximately T Sh 93.4 million (US$11.2 million) over five years (see
Annex 3). Incremental credit needs for working capital of the small-scale
industries, estimated at T Sh 4 million, will be covered by NBC through its
normal lending procedures. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from THB and Government that these funds would be made available to project
beneficiaries.
4.07      Incremental recurrent expenditures for governmental agencies at
the central and regional level (excluding THB and SIDO) are estimated at
T Sh. 3.5 million (US$0.4 million) annually. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that these expenditures would be financed through normal budget-
ary channels.

C. Land Rent and Service Charge
4.08      Experience in the first project demonstrated the infeasibility of
cost recovery arrangements in project areas which differ from those in other
urban areas (para 2.20). Charges for other areas as applied previously did
not meet IDA criteria, which call for consistent fiscal policies to recover
the economic cost of providing and maintaining the infrastructure. The
Tanzania Government does not have a clearly articulated policy on cost re-
covery in urban areas. Until 1974 legislation concerning charges in urban
areas was governed by five different ordinances. In 1974 the newly enacted
Land Rent and Service Charge Act repealed previous legislation and established
a single, consolidated charge for all urban plotholders. The basis for levy-
ing charges was to be the economic value of land as assessed by Ardhi. In
theory the economic value of land should reflect the full costs of capital
infrastructure investment and hence it should be possible to set charges at a
level sufficient to recover full costs. In practice, however, this is impos-
sible under the present circumstances: valuation rolls used by Ardhi are
outdated and new land valuation is seriously behind schedule; the Land Rent
and Service Charge Act itself is unclear on many of the issues involved; and
the collection machinery is not effective. The Government recognizes these
problems and the broader need to rationalize its fiscal policy toward urban
land, shelter and infrastructure. It has already engaged a team of consult-
ants to carry out an in-depth study of the Land Rent and Service Charge (para
2.14 and 2.21).
4.09      The purpose of the study is twofold:  (a) to analyze the existing
situation regarding the assessment and collection of the Land Rent and Service
Charge; and (b) to propose specific measures to increase its effectiveness,
yield and equity. Terms of reference for the study were agreed upon by the
Bank and Government during appraisal (see Annex 7, Attachment 1). The study
is expected to result in reforms that would introduce valuation methods
which relate the level of charges to urban infrastructure investments and
maintenance expenditures, and improve valuation, collection and enforcement
procedures. The long-term goal of these reforms is to increase the revenues
from the Land Rent and Service Charge to a level sufficient to cover invest-
ment and operating expenditures for urban infrastructure.
4.10      Detailed cost recovery arrangements for the project will be for-
mulated in conjunction with the study )J. During negotiations the inception
report for the study was reviewed and agreement reached on short-term measures,
guiding principles for the long-term reform of the Land Rent and Service
Charge and arrangements for the cost recovery in the project. As a short-term
measure, Government agreed to progressively introduce the Land Rent and
Service Charge in all squatter areas in Tanzania. This introduction will be
linked to the program of house registration (see para 5.09). The charge will
be set initially at T Sh 100, which is 33% higher than the current level of
charges in areas that have not been revalued since 1969.
1/   The study commenced on February 14, 1977.



- 20 -
4.11      Specific recommendations of the study and the agreement between
IDA and the Government on cost recovery arrangements for urban infrastructure
expenditure in the project will be guided by three main principles:
(a) self-sufficiency of the urban sector;
(b) close relationship between expenditure on and revenues
from urban land development and service infrastructure;
and
(c) simplicity of the Land Rent and Service Charge Structure.
Recommendations of the Study will be reviewed and agreement between IDA and
Government on level and composition of plot (house) charges as well as revision
and collection procedures for the project areas reached by December 31, 1977.
D. Accounts and Auditing
4.12      Procedures established in the first project have been revised to
overcome auditing problems. Separate project accounts would be maintained
for all civil works by Ardhi. The Management Section of the Sites and
Services Division will be responsible for maintaining accurate records and
preparing annual statements. Ardhi's Internal Auditor who reports directly
to the Principal Secretary will monitor project accounts. For the THB and
SIDO components the two agencies will also maintain separate accounts for
all project expenditures in their respective components. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that annually audited records of project
accounts would be submitted to IDA no later than six months following the
close of the fiscal years of Ardhi, THB and SIDO.
E. Procurement and Disbursement
4.13      Infrastructure works totalling about T Sh 59.7 million (US$7.2 mil-
lion) before contingencies will be procured through international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA Guidelines for Procurement. While the
relatively small size, scattered locations and staging of the contracts make
it unlikely that foreign firms will be attracted, a number of established
contractors in Eastern Africa should be interested in bidding. Tenders will
be advertised in Eastern Africa and embassies of Bank member countries and
Switzerland in Dar es Salaam notified. There will be prequalifications of
firms so that the Government can assess the firms' experience, financial
standing and performance on similar construction in Tanzania. Local contracts
will be accorded a preferential margin of 7.5% over foreign contractors in the
evaluation of bids.
4.14      Contracts for construction of community facilities totalling T Sh
7.8 million (US$0.95 million) before contingencies will be awarded on the basis



- 21 -
of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with standard pro-
cedures of the Ministry of Works and satisfactory to IDA. Efforts to attract
small contractors from project towns will be made by grouping contracts to be
within their range.
4.15      Equipment/vehicles totalling T Sh 16.6 million (US$2 million) will
be procured in accordance with Government's standard procedures which were
reviewed at negotiations. Cement totalling T Sh 5.4 million (US$0.65 million)
will be procured by international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
guidelines. Other building materials totalling T Sh 93.4 million (US$11.2
million) will be procured by local competitive bidding following procedures
satisfactory to IDA. SIDO will follow its usual procedures which were reviewed
at negotiations for procuring hire-purchase equipment totalling T Sh 7.8
million (US$0.9 million).
4.16      Disbursement of funds from the credit would be made on the following
basis:
(a) 70% of expenditures for civil works against payment
certificates endorsed by consultants and Ardhi;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures if directly imported or
75% of expenditures for locally purchased furniture,
equipment materials and vehicles; and
(c) 100% of foreign exchange expenditures and 75% of local
expenditures for consultant services.
4.17      In view of the urgency and importance of the Land Rent and Service
Charge Study, Government requested approval to appoint consultants to begin
the study in February 1977. Approval of retroactive financing is recommended
for consultants' fees paid prior to credit signing. Retroactive financing is
also recommended to cover consultants' services for detailed design and
engineering from May 1, 1977. A total sum of up to US$200,000 would be
required to cover expenditures incurred for these two items from February 1 to
the date of signing.

V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01      Responsibility for project execution will be shared between Ardhi,
the principal implementing agency, and the decentralized administrations
in each project town. The specialized components involving power supply,
housing loans and small industry will be handled by Tanzania Electric Supply
Company (TANESCO), THB and SIDO, respectively. Because of Tanzania's severe
manpower constraints, adjustments in central and local project management to
overcome problems experienced in the first project will emphasize more effec-
tive use of existing personnel rather than new recruitment.
A. Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (Ardhi)
5.02      Ardhi's Sites and Services Unit will have operational responsibility
for the planning and implementation of the project, as it did for the first
project. The unit will be restructured to strengthen its project management
and community development capabilities and its status within the Ministry
upgraded. Government has already approved the proposed reorganization which
will become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1977. The
project includes T Sh 1.5 million (US$0.2 million) for technical assistance to
Ardhi for the development of financial and management systems and community
development capability.
5.03      The physical planning, detailed engineering and supervision of con-
struction contracts for the infrastructure and community facilities in the
project areas will be the responsibility of the unit's Planning and Engineer-
ing Sections with assistance from consultants. The community' facilities will
be planned and designed in consultation with appropriate ministries and
regional officials. Consultants were hired to prepare preliminary engineering
designs, and detailed engineering and some supervision will also be handled by
consultants. As in the first project, the engineering consultancy contracts
will supplement on-the-job engineering training through secondment of trainees
to work with the consultants. The capabilities developed through the training
program will enable the Engineering Section to assume responsibilities, such
as the engineering for community facilities and the supervision of contractors
at some sites, handled by consultants in the first project.
5.04      The Sites and Services Unit will be responsible for the overall
scheduling and coordination of the surveyed plot program. The Planning
Section will liaise with zonal and regional planning officials to select sites
and prepare layouts. The section will prepare detailed site selection and
planning guidelines as well as model layouts and as much of the planning work
as local staffing permits will be done locally. The surveys will be carried
out by an Ardhi mobile survey crew based in Dar es Salaam. As part of the
reorganization of the Sites and Services Unit, the crew will be transferred to
the Surveys and Mapping Division, which is better able to provide the manage-
rial and professional support it requires.



- 23 -
5.05      Management and community development capabilities relatively ne-
glected during the first project will be expanded under the proposed project.
Financial management will be strengthened by recruitment of a Financial
Analyst to be financed by project technical assistance funds. In order to
familiarize local administrators with the process of project implementation,
the unit will prepare a management handbook and conduct an orientation seminar
in Dar es Salaam for local officials. Community development and land officers
in the unit will be responsible for the non-physical aspects of the project,
including publicity, allocations, registration of squatter houses and pre-
paration of titles, on-site assistance to residents in project areas, and the
formation of housing cooperatives. The unit will prepare guidelines and
information materials for the social components of the project and work with
local officials during their implementation.
B. Regional and District Administrations
Local Project Management
5.06      Teams of local officials under the direction of Project Coordinators
designated by the Regional Development Directors (RDD) will be responsible
for local implementation. The Coordinator's responsibilities will be to plan
local project implementation with assistance from the Sites and Services
Division, to coordinate the activities of the various local officials involved
in the projects, and to monitor progress and submit periodic reports to Ardhi.
One Site Officer (a junior official with technical skills in construction)
will be appointed in each project town to assist the Coordinator and to insure
a continuous administrative presence in the project communities.  Other local
officials such as the relevant Land Officers and Engineers will be responsible
for their normal administrative functions in the project areas.
5.07      Considerable attention will be given to explaining the project
to community residents and to providing on-site assistance. The Site Officers
will work closely with the new ward councils mandated by the Urban Wards
(Administration) Act, 1976. Demonstration houses built in the project areas
will be used as offices by both THB and the Site Officers as well as to
demonstrate low-cost building materials and techniques. Transportation will
be provided for households displaced by the improvement works to help them
relocate.
5.08      The regional and district administrations will assume responsibility
for the recurrent operations of the community facilities and the maintenance
of infrastructure. Budgetary allocations for these services will begin in
fiscal 1978/79. Road maintenance has been a problem in Tanzanian cities due
to budgetary constraints. An experiment in community maintenance of roads and
drains using manual equipment to be supplied through the project will be
conducted in a few project sites to be selected by Ardhi. The equipment will
be given to the local engineers who will loan it to the ward councils and
provide technical supervision.



- 24 -
Allocations and Tenure
5.09      In order to provide security of tenure in the upgrading areas,
titles based on house rather than plot occupation will be introduced. The
title form was reviewed during negotiations and revisions were agreed.
The titles will be issued for five year periods and renewed automatically on
expiration. They will also specify the level of Land Rent and Service Charge,
which can be revised with six months advance notice. The registration of
existing houses in the squatter communities will be the responsibility of the
District Land Development Officers (DLDO's). Maps based on the most recent
aerial photographs available showing the location of existing units will be
prepared by the Sites and Services Division. The DLDO's will update these
maps and work with the Site Officers and local CCM leaders to identify the
house-owners.
5.10      The DLDO's will also be responsible for soliciting and processing
applications for the surveyed plots. A points system taking into account
household income, number of dependents, employment status and length of time
on the waiting list will be used to rank applicants. The system will
be weighted to give preference to households with monthly incomes
below T Sh 1,000 (US$120). However, because of the Government's policy
of encouraging mixed-income communities and the scarcity of other housing
opportunities, there will be no income eligibility limit. At negotiations the
allocation system was reviewed and agreed. The existing District Allocation
Committees consisting of administrators, elected representatives and CCM
officials will select the allottees after review of ranked application files
prepared by the Land Offices. Allottees will be issued long-term leases
(normally for 33 years) which can be mortgaged and serve as security for THB
loans.
C. Tanzania Housing Bank (THB)
5.11      The Tanzania Housing Bank (THB) will administer the house improve-
ment and construction lending component. As in the first project, the lending
program will be run by the Sites and Services Section of THB's Operations
Department. The day-to-day administration of the program will be handled by
regional offices in Tabora, Tanga, Morogoro and Iringa. 1/ Expansion of THB's
lending operations in squatter areas and establishment of the on-site materials
depots will necessitate increases in THB staff at headquarters and in the
regions. The addition of a Procurement Officer to manage the materials opera-
tions will be particularly important. A Procurement Consultant will be
appointed to design and oversee the establishment of material loans operations
(see Annex 3, Attachment 1, for the terms of reference). THB has agreed to
hire the additional staff necessary to implement the program. Project funds
will be provided for short-term training for the staff involved in the program.
1/   The THB Sites and Services Section will assume the day-to-day management
of Dar es Salaam program.



- 25 -
5.12      For the loans in the surveyed plot areas, THB will apply its normal
lending procedures. For loans in the squatter upgrading areas, lending
procedures will be patterned after THB's rural lending program. The major
differences between the two types of loan are: I/
(a) loans in squatter areas do not have to be secured by mortgages;
(b) THB does not charge valuation fees for such loans; and
(c) loans in these areas can be made for smaller amounts for
partial home improvement.
In order to reach the target population more effectively, part-time site
offices will be established in project areas for distribution and reception
of loan applications. Depots for storage and distribution of materials will be
built in Dar es Salaam, Tabora and Morogoro. In Iringa and Tanga, storage
space will be leased. THB will offer standard house-type plans (see Annex 3,
Figure 3) to prospective borrowers and build demonstration houses in the
upgrading areas.
D. Small Industries Development Organization (SIDO)
5.13      The small-scale industry (SSI) program will be implemented by SIDO,
the parastatal responsible for assisting SSIs in Tanzania. Established in
1973 under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, SIDO has set up an extension
service in each region, usually staffed by a Promotion Officer, an Economist
and an Engineer. SIDO operates a hire-purchase program for equipment and raw
materials, eight production-cum-training centers and an industrial estate.
5.14      SIDO will hire a local Project Implementation and Training Coordina-
tor and a Project Economist for each project town. The Coordinator will be
responsible for selecting and providing assistance to participants in the
hire-purchase program and for coordinating and supervising the industrial
cluster and network schemes. Cooperatives, partnerships, sole artisans and
District Development Corporations would be eligible for SIDO support. The
Coordinator will also organize and implement apprenticeships, exchanges,
courses and individual training in accounting, technical skills, market organ-
ization and cooperative organization. The Project Economist will prepare
feasibility studies and financial packages and insure links between project
participants and lending institutions--NBC (working capital), THB (sheds) and

5.15      Consultants, probably from outside Tanzania, will assist in develop-
ing management training programs, initiating the industrial clusters and net-
works and, if necessary, assisting in subproject preparation. Two Project
Technical Advisers will spend up to two years in Tanga and Tabora assisting in
the initiation of the clusters and networks and development of training
programs. The consultants will also develop an operating manual for this kind
of program which could then be applied in other regions. Additional consulting
assistance will be made available for subproject preparation, market organiza-
tion and financial management as needed.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS
6.01      The project is expected to generate a wide range of direct benefits
to more than 315,000 low-income urban dwellers, some 26% of the total urban
population of Tanzania. Provision of essential infrastructure, regulariza-
tion of tenure and supply of credit for house improvement aim at improving
living conditions for some 160,000 inhabitants of squatter settlements.
Additional schools, market and health facilities will raise the standards of
their community facilities. The project will also meet the demand for new
shelter by providing 19,000 new surveyed plots.
Institutional and Sectoral Objectives
6.02      In addition to direct benefits to a significant proportion of
low-income urban dwellers of Tanzania, the proposed project will also con-
tribute to the development of more effective urban shelter policies and to
strengthening public institutions responsible for their implementation. The
project will further demonstrate the feasibility and replicability of a
low-cost approach to upgrading of squatter settlements. The surveyed plot
program of the project will introduce and test a novel response to the demand
for new plots, which combines minimal infrastructure investment with a planned
residential framework for building low-cost shelter. If successful, the
program will reduce the proliferation of squatter settlements and allow more
rational planning and provision of urban services. A broader approach will
also be followed in the implementation of the health community facilities. In
addition to the provision of facilities, guidelines will be developed for an
urban HICH program, similar to the existing MICH program for rural areas, with
a strong emphasis on community extension work focussed on preventive medicine
and nutrition education.
6.03      Particular attention in project implementation will be paid to the
broader fiscal and administrative contexts of urban policies. The project
will help define a program to reform the Land Rent and Service Charge, the
principal urban land use and shelter tax (para 4.07-4.10). In connection
with the reform, a dialogue with Government on other aspects of the present
system for financing urban investment and maintenance and of the administra-
tion of urban areas will be pursued. The technical assistance component of
the project has been designed to strengthen existing institutions responsible
for different aspects of urban policies at both central and regional levels.
Institution-building assistance will also be provided to SIDO and THB.
Squatter Upgrading and Surveyed Plot Program
6.04      A cost-benefit analysis based on comparison of "with project" and
"without project" situations has been used to evaluate the economic rate of
return for squatter upgrading and surveyed plots program. 1/ The analysis
1/   The shadow prices used in the analysis were derived from a number of
key primary factors, the most important of which are (i) tradable goods;
(ii) taxes and Government revenues; (iii) labor, skilled, semi-skilled,
unskilled urban and unskilled rural; and (iv) non-traded goods including
foodstuffs.

takes into account only those benefits that are easily quantifiable in
monetary terms such as higher rental income from better quality housing.
However, the project will also generate less tangible external benefits such
as better health, lower infant mortality, and a higher level of education.
The quantification of these benefits is generally difficult due to the lack
of adequate comparative data on the levels of health, education and related
variables. Therefore, the analysis based on higher rental income provides
only a partial indication of the economic return on the project.
6.05      Costs.  Project costs used in the economic analysis included all
construction, equipment and maintenance costs of infrastructure for squatter
upgrading and surveyed plots net of taxes and duties. Physical contingencies,
administration and detailed engineering were also included as well as house
improvement, new construction and resulting maintenance expenditures incurred
by project beneficiaries. The cost of schools, clinics and health programs
were omitted (see para 6.04 above).
6.06      Benefits.  Project benefits were measured by the increase in total
rent payments generated by the project. Rents may increase because existing
houses are improved, new ones are built or higher rents are paid for the same
accommodation as a result of improvement of urban services and security of
tenure. Values for differentials in the levels of new construction, house
improvements and rents between "with-the-project" and "without project" sit-
uations were based on survey evidence collected by Ardhi.
6.07      Internal rates of return for the squatter upgrading and surveyed
plot program are as follows:
Dar es Salaam          24%
Tabora                 19%
Tanga                  22%
Morogoro               22%
Iringa                 28%
All towns              23%
All towns              20%
(squatter up-
grading only)
All towns              35%
(surveyed plots
only)



- 29 -
6.08      Sensitivity Tests.  The results of the evaluation were relatively
insensitive to changes in assumptions used in the analysis. In the evalua-
tion of squatter upgrading and surveyed plots, the critical parameters were
the differential in rent levels and housebuilding and improvement rates
between improved and unimproved areas. The total value of benefits would
have to decrease 60% for the internal rate of return to fall below 10%.
Small-Scale Industry Development
6.09      Urban unemployment and limited industrial activity are major prob-
lems of Tanzanian towns which the proposed SSI component would address.
The component would bring direct and tangible benefits by creating about
870 new jobs, including 350 skilled and semi-skilled workers at a unit in-
vestment cost of US$650 (US$1,000 if working capital needs and technical
assistance are included). The potential annual output of the 150 new pro-
duction units is valued at about US$2.7 million. The component would also
demonstrate a feasible and low-cost approach to assisting the urban informal
sector and strengthen SIDO's financial, management and technical assistance
programs, especially at regional levels.
Risks
6.10      Risks involved are primarily institutional and financial.  The
project's scattered locations combined with a general shortage of qualified
personnel contribute to the institutional risks. Specific provisions for
strengthening the management capability of the institutions implementing the
projects and for improving coordination between them are made in the project
to limit this kind of risk. Financial risk is associated with the reform
of the Land Rent and Service Charge. While the Government expressed its
willingness to undertake the reform, its complete implementation may prove
difficult in the context of continuing budgetary constraints and scarcity of
qualified personnel. Flexibility, careful timing and continuing monitoring
will be required. However, even partial implementation of the reform will
represent a significant improvement over the existing situation. Financial
risk is also involved in THB lending program in the squatter areas, given
its novelty and lending criteria and procedures less stringent than those
normally employed by THB. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from the Government that the Treasury would closely monitor the progress
of the program and, if required, take the necessary steps to protect THB's
financial integrity.

TANZANIA
SECOND NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
Squatter Settlements and Project Towns
1.        This Annex describes the characteristics of the housing and
residents of squatter communities in two project towns and provides a
brief sketch of each project town. Its final section summarizes the
analysis used to determine the demand for surveyed plots in each town.
A. Characteristics of Squatter Housing and Residents
2.        Detailed studies of housing characteristics in project communities
are available for Dar es Salaam and Tabora (Table 4). The characteristics
of squatter housing in the two towns are quite similar, and analogous studies
in the other three towns are likely to produce comparable results. Local
variations in typical building materials are discussed in the profiles of
the project towns.
3.        In both cities the model squatter dwelling had four rooms and
housed four to eight people, although over a quarter had ten or more
residents. Squatter houses often follow the traditional Swahili house plan,
illustrated in Figure 1, which is characterized by a front verandah, a
central corridor and four to six rooms.. The rooms often have external
access and, therefore, can be rented easily. Monthly room rents in Dar es
Salaam tended to fall in the T Sh 20-29 range; those in Tabora were somewhat
lower.
4.        Physically, the model squatter house type is a mud and pole structure
with a corrugated iron roof; roughly half have cement floors. Two-thirds of
the houses in Dar es Salaam had no foundations, compared to 39% in Tabora (a
high water table in one of the Tabora settlements may encourage residents to
install foundations and floors). Pit latrines were by far the most common
form of sanitation in both cities. The more detailed information available
for the Dar es Salaam settlements indicates that 54% of the houses had open
pits or pits with only temporary structures. 16% of the houses in Tabora and
4% of those in Dar es Salaam had piped water on the plot. In Tabora, where a
more detailed question was asked, almost 20% of the houses had no access to
local standpipes, and another 45% were more than 100m from a standpipe. Data
about effective plot size coverage and use wer! also collected in Tabora.
Seventy percent of the plots were 200 to 300 m ; 81% of the informants felt
that their plots were large enough. Slightly more than half of the plots had
50% to 74% coverage, with the majority having around 50%. Almost 90% of the
plots had gardens and 9% had businesses.
5.        A large survey of Dar es Salaam residents in 1971 permits comparison
of the characteristics of people living in squatter settlements and planned
areas of the city (Table 5). The survey indicated that 69% of the squatters
were migrants, compared to 66% of the non-squatters. There were also no major



ANNEX 1
Page 2
differences between the groups in the reasons given for coming to Dar es
Salaam. Residents in squatter areas were somewhat more likely to be home-
owners, 17% claiming to own a home in Dar es Salaam compared to 7% of those
living in planned areas of the city.
6.        Residents in the planned areas tended to have more education and
higher incomes than the squatters. Half of the squatter respondents had no
formal education, compared to just over a quarter of the non-squatters.
At the other end of the educational spectrum, only 5% of the squatters had
reached Form I or higher, compared to 23% of the non-squatters. Income
is closely related to education, and the squatters had lower incomes. A
third of them had incomes below T Sh 200 (US$24) a month, while only 15% of
the other respondents had comparably low incomes. At the other end of the
income distribution, 41% of the non-squatters had monthly incomes of T Sh 400
(US$48) or more, compared to only 15% of the squatters. Educational attain-
ments were associated with income among both squatters and non-squatters;
however, even when education was statistically controlled, the non-squatters
had somewhat higher incomes. Self-employment and casual labor were somewhat
more common among residents of squatter areas. Unemployment rates were
comparable for the two groups, with about 20% of each group indicating that
they were unemployed or seeking work.
7.        These comparisons indicate that differences between the residents
of squatter settlements and planned residential areas in Dar es Salaam are
relatively small. Far from being marginal areas populated by economically
marginal residents, the squatter settlements are an integral part of the
city. Other squatter settlements chosen for upgrading in the proposed project
are comparably integrated in the socio-economic structure of their cities.
B. Project Town Profiles
8.        Maps IBRD 12573-7 show land-use patterns and the locations of the
project sites in each town. The criteria used to select the sites and the
chracteristics of each site are discussed in Annex 6.
Dar es Salaam
9.        Dar es Salaam is by far the largest city in Tanzania, more than
six times larger than the second biggest city, and accounts for 42% of the
national urban population. As the colonial capital and principal port,
Dar es Salaam was the administrative and commercial hub of the Tanganyika
Colony. During the past decade the Government has endeavored to decentral-
ize both the economy and the administration. The regionalization of the
Tanzanian Government during the early 1970's led to the dispersion of over
40% of the Government's central establishment from Dar es Salaam, a trend
which will continue with the development of Dodoma as the new national
capital. Economic decentralization has been far less successful, and the
completion of the TAZARA railway line from Dar es Salaam to Zambia has re-
inforced Dar es Salaam's importance as a transportation center.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
10.       Dar es Salaam's 1977 population is estimated to be 630,000,
based on an average growth rate of 8.5% a year during the past decade.
At its current estimated annual growth rate of 7%, the city will reach one
million inhabitants by 1985. Approximately two-thirds of the population
now lives in squatter housing. During 1963-73, a period for which reliable
data are available, squatter housing expanded at an average rate of 16.6%
a year. Mianzese and Mtoni-Tandika, upgrading areas in the first and second
projects respectively, are the largest squatter settlements in the country.
(The characteristics of the housing in Manzese are described in para 3-4
and Table 4). Although Dar es Salaam provides over 40% of the country's
urban wage employment, unemployment and low incomes are major problems for
its residents. For example, a recent survey in Manzese suggested that 10%
of the household heads and much larger proportions of other household members
were unemployed. A Bureau of Statistics budget survey in Manzese and Mtoni-
Tandika during 1975-76 indicated that almost a quarter of the households
had incomes below the minimum wage (TSH380 or US$46 a month).
Tanga
11.       For the past two decades Tanga has experienced relative stagnation
compared to other towns and is being eclipsed by Arusha as Tanzania's second
largest city. Prior to World War II, Tanga prospered as a port serving the
rich northern agricultural region and its settler population. Its last
spurt of growth occurred during 1952-57 when the population nearly doubled,
largely because of rises in world market prices for sisal. Since then,
however, its economy has expanded sluggishly and the population has grown more
slowly than in other principal cities.  Efforts to divert port traffic to
Tanga from Dar es Salaam may provide some economic stimulus in the future.
12.       In 1976, Tanga's population was estimated to be 90,000 based on a
stable growth rate of 5% a year. The town's economic problems are indicated
by the fact that wage labor grew at an average rate of only 1% a year between
1962 and 1972. The Tanga Master Plan 1975-1995 pointed to unemployment and
underemployment as severe problems. A survey conducted in 1974 as part of the
master planning exercise indicated that the bottom 50% of the households had
monthly incomes of T Sh 300 (US$36) or less. According to budget surveys
conducted by the Bureau of Statistics during 1975-76, over half of the house-
holds in selected low-income communities had incomes below the minimum wage.
Housing conditions in Tanga generally appear to be worse than in other project
cities. The Master Plan categorized 45% of the housing as in "bad" condition
in 1974. 1/ Squatter housing has been expanding rapidly particularly along
the main southern access route. Ardhi estimates that 40% of the population
currently lives in squatter housing. The prevalence of thatch roofs which
catch fire frequently suggests that the availability of materials loans for
corrugated iron sheets should be stressed in the upgrading program in Tanga.
1/   Ardhi's Urban Planning Department uses a standard house rating system.
The lowest rating is assigned to units "built of temporary or semi-
temporary materials and those incapable of rehabilitation." Master Plan
for Morogoro (1974), p. 6.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
Morogoro
13.       Morogoro, located 180 km southwest of Dar es Salaam, has promising
growth prospects. It is an important transportation center, situated on
the Tanzam Highway, the Eastern African Railways central line and the road
from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma. Morogoro was selected as a site for a Bank-
financed industrial estates project which will provide 3,000 new jobs.
It is also an educational center with four secondary schools, a teacher
training college, the National Institute of Development Management, and
the agricultural faculty of the University of Dar es Salaam.
14.       Morogoro's 1977 population is estimated at 45,000 and the town is
growing at an estimated rate of 6% a year. Table 6 indicates that Morogoro
has the highest wage employment per capita and, proportionately, the largest
manufacturing sector among the project towns. However, sisal and tobacco
processing industries account for much of this emp'loyment, and average wage
earnings per job are below the national urban average. More than 40% of
the population lives in squatter settlements. The Master Plan for Morogoro
prepared in 1974 classified 80% of the housing in Msamvu, a project upgrad-
ing site, as "poor", but the proportion of "good" housing in the town's
other squatter settlements (36%) was comparable to the rest of the town.
The potential for house improvement in Morogoro's squatter settlements thus
appears high.
Iringa
15.       Iringa is located about 400 km southwest of Dar es Salaam on the
Tanzam Highway. It is a commercial and trading center for one of the most
fertile agricultural areas in the country. Although it is strategically
located for the development of agricultural processing industries, the city
currently does not have any major industries, and the tertiary sector is
proportionately more important than in the other cities (Table 6). A short-
age of piped water is an impediment to economic expansion as well as a poten-
tial health hazard.
16.       The city's population of 56,000 is estimated to be expanding at
8% a year. During 1967-75, planned areas grew at an average annual rate
of 6% compared to 14% for the squatter areas; the proportion of squatters
in the total population rose from 26% to 49%. Soil conditions are appropriate
and firewood is available for burnt bricks in Iringa. Therefore, much of
the housing in the squatter settlements is structurally very sound. The
Bureau of Statistics' pilot household budget survey in 1974 included a small
sample (59) in Kihesa, one of the communities to be upgraded. Approximately
45% of the households sampled had incomes below the minimum wage.
Tabora
17.       Tabora, 520 km west of Dar es Salaam, was an important Arab trading
town which was developed as an administrative center by the Germans. The East
African Railways line from Dar es Salaam and Dodoma branches in Tabora and the
EAR has a servicing yard there. Tabora is also a national educational center,
with six secondary schools, teacher training and secretarial colleges, a SIDO



ANNEX 1
Page 5
cottage industry school, and EAR vocational training school. However, the
town lacks major manufacturing and processing industries, and its narrow
economic base poses a major problem for its future growth.
18.       Tabora's estimated 1977 population is 69,000; it is growing at the
comparatively low rate of 5% a year. Data presented in the Master Plan for
Tabora indicate that in 1967-72, the population of squatter areas grew at 6%
a year, compared to 3% per annum in other areas. Ardhi estimates that about
70% of the population now lives in squatter areas. The characteristics of
the housing in two squatter settlements are described in paras 3-4 and Table
4. The regional administration undertook an improvement program affecting
500 houses in one squatter settlement on its own in 1972. The gravity of the
employment situation in Tabora is indicated by Table 6; among the project
towns Tabora had the least employment per capita and proportionately the
smallest secondary sector (manufacturing and construction). Average incomes
in Tabora are substantially below the national urban sector average.
C. Size of the Surveyed Plot Program
19.       The analysis used to determine the number of plots to be surveyed
in the project is summarized in Table 7. Detailed data about population
characteristics, household formation and effective demand for housing in
Tanzania's cities are not available. Therefore, a simple approach based
primarily on projected population growth was adopted. The population and
growth rate estimates presented in Table I were used as the starting point
for the analysis. It was assumed that a population equivalent to the increase
due to natural growth would be accommodated in existing housing. The estimated
growth rates were therefore deflated to remove the impact of natural increase,
estimated at 1.8% a year based on analysis of data from the last census. The
resulting rates were then used to project the number of people who will need
new housing during the project implementation period, 1977-1981. The result-
ing figures were reduced by 25% to reflect infilling and extension of houses
in existing squatter communities and the very limited availability of other
housing opportunities for better-off households (e.g., NHC and THB houses and
medium-and low-density plots prepared by the regions).
20.       The estimated net demand for new housing was then divided by the
average number of people per plot in low-incomes communities to determine
the required number of plots. Although Ardhi uses seven people per plot as
a planning guideline, nine was chosen as a more realistic figure reflecting
prevailing conditions in existing high-density settlements. The estimated
total need for surveyed plots for all five towns is 18,977. 1/ It should
1/   This is 19% fewer plots than Ardhi originally estimated would be needed.
Ardhi's projections took into account the number of households on the
district allocation waiting lists as well as population growth over a
three year period. The mission chose not to take the waiting lists into
account because they are not consistently kept up to date.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
be noted that this estimate does not take into account the backlog of demand
due to the small size of the surveyed plot program in the past. Because of
the unreliability of the data and parameters on which the estimates are
based, the phasing of allocations of surveyed plots will be planned to begin
slowly and to increase in relation to the volume of applications received.
If the application rate is lower than anticipated, the allocations can be
phased over a longer period.

TANZANIA
SECOND NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
Community Facilities Program
INTRODUCTION
1.        To raise the level of community services in each site to national
standards, the project will provide primary schools, Mother and Child Health
(MCH) Clinics, and markets. The number and location of these facilities is
summarized in Table 1. This Annex reviews the sectoral context, first project
experience and the proposed approach in the second project for each category
of community facility.
SCHOOLS
2.        Background.  In 1974, the Tanzanian Government established an
ambitious program of universal primary education aiming at 100 percent enroll-
ment by 1977. Despite considerable progress, it has since become apparent
that achievement of this target would entail severe pressure on the national
budget and take a longer time. 1/
3.        Due to the severe shortage of funds, school construction in the
regions has been falling behind schedule. The cost of classrooms constructed
by contractor is currently estimated at T Sh 20,000 for upcountry towns and
T Sh 40,000 in Dar es Salaam. However, on the assumption self-help is avail-
able, Government allocates each region amounts sufficient to buy only building
materials. Over the past two years, this has been cut back from T Sh 8,000
per classroom to T Sh 5,000 for upcountry towns, and from T Sh 20,000 to T Sh
5,000 in Dar es Salaam. Local officials have repeatedly commented on the
difficulty of obtaining self-help labor in urban areas. As a result, funds to
finance classrooms are transferred from other budgets and/or the funds pooled
and fewer classrooms built. In the Dar es Salaam region, for example, only 74
of the 101 classrooms scheduled to be constructed in 1975/1976 were actually
completed. In the town of Morogoro, seven of the ten classrooms planned were
constructed. Typically, a one stream (seven years) school is opened with one
classroom for the entering Standard I pupils. A class room is added each year
to allow the intake of new students as the first year students advance. The
1/   For detailed information see "Fiscal Implications of Universal Primary
Education and Universal Rural Water Supply", report of World Bank
Special Mission, March 1976. The achievement of UPE would require
almost doubling the number of classrooms in order to accommodate
the increase of school population from 433,000 in 1975/1976 to
841,000 in 1977.



ANNEX 2

school is _orirleted at the end of six years.  Building standards are low:
concrete floors, unpainted cement block or burnt brick walls, corrugated
iron roofing, no ceilings, and screens for windows.
4.        To date, urban schools have had no shortage of staff and sufficient
funds for the teachers' salaries have been provided by the Government. How-
ever, severe shortages exist for supplies. In 1975 the Ministry of Education
recommended an annual average expenditure of T Sh 80 per primary school pupil
for supplies. In fact, the Dar es Salaam region received only about T Sh 15
per pupil in 1975-76. 1/
5.        First Project Experience.  Phase I primary schools were originally
designed as complete "Community Education Centers", with six classrooms,
teachers' offices, kitchen, dining hall, craft workshops and dispensary.
Their cost is presently estimated at T Sh 1.2 million per school. In light
of the financial constraints, the proposed standards are unrealistically
high. Furthermore, the provision of workshops and technical workshops
attached to primary schools is still an experimental program, aimed at a
small number of schools, funded by Danish aid and therefore not generally
applicable at this time.
6.        Second Project. Phase II schools will basically provide classroom
space. As shown in Table 8, Annex 6, a one stream school will include six
classrooms, 2/ a small administration block, and a toilet block. Building
standards will be as low as possible: concrete floors, burnt brick or
cement block walls, corrugated iron roofing, and screens for windows.
Ceilings will be included if funds allow. Space will be provided on the
site for additional streams and workshops that could be constructed in
the future. The cost estimate of T Sh 43,000 (US$5,180) per classroom in
Dar es Salaam is based on the 1975 contract price of a classroom updated to
mid-1977 level. For upcountry towns, the cost of a classroom is estimated
at T Sh 33,000 (US$3,976). 3/ The project will also provide T Sh 5,500
(US$663) per classroom for furniture and T Sh 40 per pupil to partially
cover initial expenditure on books and supplies. Anticipated recurrent
staffing and supply expenses are presented in Table 4.
7.        To determine the number of schools to be provided (see Table 2),
the school-age population and existing facilities in and adjacent to the
1/   The Dar region received T Sh 944,000 for supplies in 1974-75, 850,000
in 1975-76, and is expected to receive only 835,000 in 1976-77. Due
to inflation and the increase in enrollment both current and real
per pupil expenditures have decreased substantially.
2/   As Standard I and II operate on double shifts, only six classrooms
are needed for the seven standards.
3/   On the basis of information supplied by regional education officers,
it is assumed that a 25 percent saving can be achieved in the
construction of upcountry classrooms with contracts tendered locally.



ANNEX 2

project areas were taken into consideration (see Table 2). Most of the
existing schools are not completed because of the staged expansion described
in para 3. It was assumed, however, that the regions will find the resources,
as they have in the past, to add classrooms each year and gradually equalize
the number of streams per standard.
8.        The Bank supports the goal of UPE, although it remains concerned
with the overall costs of the program and would prefer to see the target
reached over a longer time span. On the basis of a one stream school for
315 children or approximately 225 families and in conjunction with planned
regional efforts, the project would help to meet the demand for new class-
rooms required for close to 100% enrollment of the current school-age popu-
lation in project areas by 1981.
HEALTH AND NUTRITION
9.        Background.  Tanzania's health problems are severe.  In 1967,
infant mortality was at 165/1,000, with life expectancy at birth only 41
years. Most sickness results from poverty-linked infectious and parasitic
diseases, such as malaria, measles, and gastroenteritis, and from various
anemias and protein malnutrition. These diseases affect both urban and rural
areas.
10.       To combat these problems, Tanzania has been committed to a rapid
extension of its health care system, particularly over the past six years.
Foreign assistance has been crucial in this expansion; 90% of the 1975/76
health development budget of T Sh 97 million was supplied by outside donors,
up from 70% the year before. For fiscal year 1977/76, the recurrent public
sector expenditures, financed from internal sources, were about T Sh 400
million (US$48 million), an expenditure of T Sh 27 per capita. At 2.4% of
GNP, this represents a stronger public sector commitment to health care than
is shown by other countries of similar per capita incomes. The 1975/80 Five
Year Plan calls for public health care to expand to 4.5% of GNP. Such an
expansion, however, would generate further pressure on the public budget. In
view of present budgetary constraints its achievement appears unlikely.
11.       Most of the health sector investment is going to the rural areas.
By 1980, the Five Year Plan calls for one 4-room rural dispensary for every
8,000 people and a larger rural health center for every 50,000. The emphasis
is placed on preventive care to the two groups in greatest need--pregnant
women and children under the age of five. One of the rooms of the rural
dispensary serves as a Mother and Child Health (MCH) Clinic, staffed by a
specially trained MCH aide and providing basic pre-natal and post-natal
examinations, innoculations, medicine, nutrition education and food supple-
ments if necessary.
12.       The program has been well established in rural areas, following
Ministry of Health guidelines. With the cooperation of USAID and UNICEF,



ANNEX 2
Page 4
twenty centers to train MCH aides have been set up which will be supplying
450 MCH aides per year by 1980. The standards for the program have been kept
low: a simple MCH aide kit is distributed to all facilities and the aides
are given only a basic 18-month course.
13.       Urban Health and First Project Experience.  Urban populations
have traditionally had greater access to medical care than rural families,
with most cities served by a district or regional hospital and outpatient
clinics or dispensaries. However, the availability of care is unevenly
distributed, with facilities adjacent to squatter areas severely overcrowded.
1/ Designed to serve 20,000-30,000 people, urban dispensaries are usually
large (about 400 square meters), with high physical standards. Curative
treatment is emphasized, although some preventative care, such as innocula-
tions, is given. These facilities have high recurrent costs, due particularly
to the large expense for drugs and other supplies. 2/ Recurrent funding has
been inadequate and severe shortage of simple equipment, such as sterilizers,
clamps and beds, often prevents the staff from carrying out simple operations
which the facilities are designed to handle. As a result, many patients must
still be referred to the hospitals.
14.       Designs of health facilities in the first project, based on
model Health Ministry plans, conformed to the traditional pattern of urban
medicine and emphasized curative care and high construction standards.
15.       Second Project Program.  The second project will extend the
emphasis on preventive medicine from rural to urban areas by financing the
construction and/or expansion of MCH clinics. The program should help hold
down recurrent expenses, relieve the overcrowding of existing facilities,
and improve the access to health care for pregnant mothers and small
children in squatter areas.
16.       In selecting the location and type of MCI facility, complete clinic
or extension, existing medical facilities were taken into account (see
Table 3). Although a few clinics already operate in some towns, no specific
guidelines have been established to indicate the changes required for the
large-scale implementation of the MCH program in urban areas. The Ministry
of Health has agreed to prepare such guidelines which will specify the serv-
ices to be offered, the number of patients to be served, organization of the
facility, staffing, equipment, layout and estimated capital and recurrent
1/ Dispensaries near the project sites in Dar es Salaam were designed
to handle 500 patients a day; they currently handle 1,000-1,500 per
day.
2/   In the current Five Year Plan, it is projected that 40% of a clinic's
total expenses, including salaries, should be allocated for supplies.
However, in two Dar es Salaam dispensaries, supplies equal 60-70%
of total costs.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
costs. Emphasis will be placed on the efficient utilization of staff,
reducing physical standards, and limiting recurrent expenses.
17.       An urban MCH should serve about 30,000 people and accommodate
a daily flow of 250-350 mothers and children. Table 8 of Annex 6 pre-
sents a tentative list of functions and specifications for a complete
MCH, based on a well-functioning clinic in Dar es Salaam. A type design
for the clinics will be included in the guidelines. To lower capital
costs, two construction standards should be used: a low standard, similar
to that used for school classrooms, for the waiting and registration areas;
and a higher standard for medical facilities, i.e., the rooms where actual
treatment or injections are given. Recurrent costs and staffing level
are given in Table 4.
18.       The guidelines for urban MCH program will also include a community
extension program focussing on nutrition education, and which should become
one of the standard functions of the clinic. The current MCH nutrition
education program offers short lessons on nutrition and other subjects while
the women are waiting for consultation; however, mothers' attendance is
only sporadic. There is little effort to follow up on children identified
in the clinic as malnourished. Mothers are encouraged to return to receive
further guidance, but home visits are rarely made. In an attempt to over-
come these problems, nutrition and MCH aides based at the clinic will be
assigned to work in adjacent communities, visiting houses of particularly
malnourished families and providing regular courses in family hygiene,
nutrition and environmental sanitation at community centers. UNICEF guidance
and assistance will be sought in improving the nutrition education program.
19.       The program should begin with at least two extension workers
assigned to each clinic, with the possibility that more may be added as
the country meets its health manpower requirements. The project will
finance bicycles, motorbikes, and other equipment necessary for starting
the program. The guidelines for the extension service will be prepared
with the assistance of the local UNICEF office, which has agreed to
finance a field work orientation seminar providing MCH aides. The exten-
sion workers will be placed under the supervision of the MCH clinic director.
MARKETS
20.       Design, construction and management of markets is the responsibility
of the regions.  Most towns have one or two large markets and a few smaller
neighborhood markets.  These smaller markets may have some high standard,
formally constructed stalls, but are primarily made of informal wooden stalls,
built by the vendors themselves and frequently strung out along the roadside.
It has been difficult for the regions to raise funds to improve these markets,
as all revenues collected from stall rents are channeled to the central
Treasury.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
21.       In the first project, markets were designed to provide some higher
quality, more hygienic stalls, particularly for meat and fish selling. It
is anticipated they will serve a population of 15-20,000. Standards for
the second project will be similar. As outlined in Table 8, Annex 6, the
proposed markets would include eight vegetable stalls, built to low standards
of unfinished concrete block walls and no water, and four meat stalls, built
to higher standards of fully enclosed space, washable concrete surfaces, and
piped water. A porch in front of the stalls and toilet block are included.
Recurrent expenses for the market are shown in Table 4.

TANZANIA
SECOND NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
House Improvement and Construction Loans Program
1.        Under this project, house improvement and construction loans to
project beneficiaries will be made by the Tanzania Housing Bank (THB). This
will be an extension of the program established under the first project with
modifications designed to address problems encountered. This annex discusses
recent developments in the organization and management of THB, 1/ reviews the
experience of the first project and describes the proposed lending program
for the second project.
A. THB--Recent Developments
2.        Since 1974 THB has embarked upon an ambitious program of regional-
ization. It currently has ten Regional Branches as well as a Zonal Office in
Moshi (covering Kilimanjaro, Arusha and Tanga regions). In the near future
THB plans to establish branches in eight remaining regions of the mainland,
where Regional Cooperative Unions presently act as THB agents. In early 1976
the heads of Regional Branches were promoted to Manager levels. However, all
lending operations still have to be approved by the Head Office. THB Manage-
ment is currently considering an experimental delegation of lending responsi-
bility to the Zonal Office in Moshi.
3.        The THB staff has grown rapidly from 100 persons in mid-1974 to 270
in mid-1976. As a parastatal, THB offers better promotion and career develop-
ment possibilities than most other government employment and is therefore able
to attract qualified personnel. However, difficulties are experienced in two
areas: accounting and architecture. These are due to the general shortage of
qualified Tanzanians and the length of formal training in those fields.
Currently ten members of THB staff are being trained locally and abroad. 2/
4.        THB has diversified its operations.  It administers the Workers'
and Farmers' Housing Development Fund, created in mid-1974 and financed
by a monthly levy of 2% of the wage bill of every employer of ten or
more persons. The Fund is likely to become one of the main sources of

tion and management see the appraisal report for the first project

THB's financing for low cost housing in both urban and rural areas. On
the other end of its lending activities spectrum, THB set up a subsidiary,
THB Estates, which builds and sells high standard housing estates and
commercial buildings.
5.        The balance sheet of THB as of 31 December 1975 is shown in
Table 1. Since its creation THE has considerably improved its financial
situation. Between 1974 and 1975, and despite a 58% increase in its admin-
istrative and overhead expenses due primarily to regionalization, profit
(before taxes) increased from T Sh 0.4 million to T Sh 2.4 million. The
volume of lending increased 58% to T Sh 177.6 million (US$21.4 million).
The majority of those loans was made for medium-cost housing, priced at
T Sh 35,000 or more. The average interest charged is 7% per annum. The
lending policies of THB are sound, if anything somewhat conservative,
stressing the link between the income of prospective borrowers and their
housing plans. THB's building inspectors follow-up the loans in order
to ensure that the loan money is not misused. The rate of default is low
and the enforcement is fairly rigorous.
6.        A vigorous savings mobilization campaign across the country in
1975 was very successful and resulted in a 71.5% increase in deposits
over the 1974 level from T Sh 74.6 million to T Sh 127.8 million. Within
those deposits the share of fixed term two-year deposits increased from
7.3% in December 1974 to 24% in December 1975. The average interest
rate on public deposits is 5.4%. 1/
7.        Despite the spectacular increase in public deposits, there was
still need in 1975 to find complementary sources to finance THB's lending
operations. The main source was the Workers' and Farmers' Housing Develop-
ment Fund which provided T Sh 31.5 million at 3.5%. THB management believes
that it will be able to finance the future demand for mortgages out of its
own resources (including Workers' and Farmers' Rousing Development Fund).
The present spread between the average cost of money from all sources and
income from lending operations -- estimated at 2% -- is judged satisfactory.
There is a concern however that a greater share of fixed terms deposits
which are paid a higher interest rate than the short term deposits, combined
with an increased emphasis on low-cost housing loans, which carry lower
interest rates than medium and high-cost housing, might result in a reduc-
tion of the spread. The interest rates on deposits and loans have not been
adjusted since early 1974. An upward adjustment appears desirable in the
middle term, but it should take place in the context of an overall review of
the interest rate structure of the banking sector.
1/   The effective rate is lower (about 5%) due to the short maturity
(less than a year) of the majority of deposits.

B. Experience of the First Project
8.        It is still too early to draw definitive conclusions about the
effectiveness of the lending program in the first project. There are, how-
ever, indications that the program did not work as well as expected. In the
site and services areas, the proportion of project beneficiaries who applied
for loans was lower and the loan amounts higher than originally anticipated.
Until mid 1976 no loans have been made in improvement areas. This was due
mainly to the fact that in dealing with project beneficiaries, THB was apply-
ing its normal lending procedures which are rather stringent and not geared
toward the means and expectations of the target population. There was also
a lack of coordination between THB and Ardhi.
9.        A number of steps were taken during recent supervision missions
to increase the effectiveness of the program. Formal coordination of THB
and Ardhi programs has been established. THB has agreed to adopt a more
aggressive posture in project areas. A publicity campaign advertising
the availability of loans has been undertaken. Lending criteria have
been relaxed somewhat and application procedures simplified. A demonstra-
tion houses program was started in late 1976 and part-time site offices
opened in the project areas.
10.       In the second project further effort will be made to simplify lend-
ing procedures and establish THB's presence in the project areas (see para
16 below). This should help to overcome the reluctance of the inhabitants who
often tend to perceive THB as a remote, somewhat aloof and hardnosed institu-
tion lending mostly for large projects. In addition, the problem of access to
building materials encountered in the first project will be addressed more
directly in the second project.
11.       The problem of access to building materials has two facets.  First,
building materials, particularly cement, are scarce; second, the existing
distribution system is inefficient and does not reach the target population on
a systematic basis. Therefore, in the absence of specific measures aimed at
ensuring an adequate supply of building materials to project areas, many
project beneficiaries are unlikely to obtain them at reasonable prices.
C. The Lending Program in the Second Project
12.       Under the project, three categories of loans for house improvement
and construction will be made:
(a) Loans for improvement of existing houses in upgrading
areas. The average size of these loans, which will be
used primarily for building materials, is estimated at
T Sh 4,000 and the estimated take-up rate for this
category is 20% of the eligible population.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
(b) Loans for construction of new houses for households
to be relocated as a result of squatter upgrading
works. The average size of these loans is estimated
at T Sh 14,500. The estimated take-up rate for this
category is 60%.
(c) Loan for construction of new houses in surveyed plot
areas. The average size of these loans is estimated
at T Sh 13,000. The estimated take-up rate for this
category is 30%.
13.       Given the novelty of lending in upgrading and surveyed plot areas,
no firm data exist on the take-up rate for these categories. The proposed
rates are mission estimates based on discussion with THB and Ardhi staff.
The average size of loans is based on estimated costs of improvement and
construction of houses (see Annex 9 for details). It was assumed that the
houses in surveyed plots areas, where the level of services will be very
low initially, will be of somewhat lower quality than new houses in better
serviced areas. The size and volume of the lending program is summarized
below:

2. Relocation               1,519          60%            920           13,340
3. Surveyed Plots Area   18,977            30%          5,700           74,100
Total                34,797                        9,480           98,880
14.       In addition to the house improvement and construction loans, THB
will also make loans for construction of worksheds to the participants in the
small-scale industry programs in Tanga and Tabora. The maximum size of these
loans will be T Sh 120,000 (US$14,500). The size of the workshed construction
program is estimated at T Sh 2.8 million (US$0.34 million).
15.       Under the first project, IDA and the Government were to supply funds
to THB for the total estimated demand for loans from project beneficiaries.
In the second project, IDA and Government contributions will focus on those
aspects of the program that appear as likely impediments to its effective im-
plementation. No major difficulties are anticipated for financing of the
lending program for house construction and improvement. IDA will provide
T Sh 8.9 million (US$1.075 million) to cover the foreign exchange costs for
importing cement for the first three years (see para 19 below), loans for work-
sheds, staff training and equipment necessary to operate the lending program
effectively. THB will finance the balance before contingencies of T Sh 93.4



ANNEX 3
Page 5
million (US$11.2 million). Assuming that the lending program will be spread
over five years, the average annual lending volume between 1978 and 1982 would
be T Sh 18.6 million (US$2.2 million). This represents 10.6% of current
THB lending. In the past, THB has been able to finance considerably larger
expansion of its operations. Assurances were obtained at negotiation that
THB will supply the funds for the local currency balance of the lending
program.
Lending Procedures
16.       The lending procedures and terms for surveyed plots areas will
be similar to those normally applicable to low-cost housing. Loans will
be secured with a first mortgage which can be obtained only for plots held
under long-term right of occupancy. Letters of intent from Ardhi indi-
cating that preparation of a long-term right-of-occupancy title has been
initiated are to accompany the loan application. The applicant has to show
his ability to repay and is required to put down 5% of the total construc-
tion cost. This sum however includes different fees to be paid in connec-
tion with the loan.
17.       For loans in squatter upgrading areas, THB will use procedures
similar to those used in its rural lending program. These loans do not
have to be secured with mortgages and fees are considerably lower. The
application process for the loans will be administered from offices housed
in THB demonstration houses to be constructed in the upgrading areas. The
application form will have to be signed by the District and TANU officials
in order to confirm the information supplied by the applicant. Rental
income will be considered in determination of the applicant's ability to pay.
Loan applications will be sent to THB's Sites and Services Section for final
approval.
18.       Procedures and lending terms (interest rates, grace period, and down
payment requirements) for loans to small-scale industry program participants
for workshed construction will be less stringent than those normally applied
by THB in its lending for commercial operations. SIDO's Project Economist will
play a crucial role as a link between program participants and THB. He will
assist the participants in preparing the loan applications. His feasibility
studies will be used by THB to determine applicant's ability to pay.
Materials Loans
19.       Borrowers will have a choice of taking their loans in cash or
vouchers redeemable against specific quantities of cement, corrugated iron
sheets or other building materials. These materials will be available to
project borrowers at THB materials depots to be built on project sites. THEB
will procure locally available materials using its own resources and maintain
adequate stocks at on-site depots. Cement, however, is a scarce commodity in
Tanzania; the current production of cement by the Wazo Hill factory in Dar es



ANNEX 3
Page 6
Salaam satisfies only about two-thirds of the existing demand. The shortage
is unlikely to be alleviated before 1980 when two new plants under construc-
tion in Tanga and Mbeya will begin production. Thus, it is expected that the
incremental demand generated by the project estimated at 12,360 tons over
three years will have to be covered by imports. Foreign exchange to cover the
needs of the first three years are therefore included in the project. Table
2 provides an estimate of the cement requirements for the program.
20.       Figure 1 presents a simplified flow chart for cement procurement.
The purchase, storage and transportation arrangement will be the responsi-
bility of the Procurement Officer in THB's Sites and Services Section. In
order to design and oversee the implementation of the materials loan opera-
tions a Procurement Consultant will be hired for three months (see Attachment
I for the Terms of Reference). Bulk purchases from the Saruji Corporation,
which is responsible for importing cement will be made on a periodic basis.
The materials will be transported by truck or railway--whichever is cheaper--
and by hired rather than purchased vehicles. The initial distribution of
materials among project towns and sites will be based on the estimates of
demand shown in Table 2. Subsequent shipment will be adjusted to reflect the
actual pace of lending. Depots for storage of the materials will be built in
three towns where the demand is likely to be the greatest, Dar es Salaam,
Tabora and Morogoro. In Tanga and Iringa storage space will be leased. The
price for materials charged to borrowers will reflect the full cost of pur-
chasing and transporting the materials and operating the depots.
THB Staffing Requirement for Project Implementation
21.       In order to implement this component THB will have to increase its
staff both in its Sites and Services Section in Dar es Salaam and in the other
project towns. Table 3 indicates the existing staffing pattern and the new
staff necessary to carry out the program. A Procurement Officer responsible
for ordering materials and arranging for their transportation will be added to
the headquarters staff in addition to the existing positions. A Building
Inspector and Bank Clerk will be added to the operational staff in Tabora,
Tanga and Morogoro, and a Bank Clerk added in Iringa where the project lending
operation will be modest. Staff to manage the materials depots in Dar es
Salaam, Tabora, and Morogoro will also be needed. The estimated annual salary
costs for the new staff are approximately T Sh 355,000. No serious difficul-
ties are expected in finding qualified Tanzanian nationals for the new posts.
As part of the loan agreement THB will undertake to hire the additional staff
necessary to implement and operate the program.

Explanatory Note on Cement Estimation
1.        The figures are derived by the following calculation:
(a)  in order to build a Swahili house of 100 m  with concrete
floor 3.75 tons of cement are required. This is obtained
as follows:
(i)  floors - 100 m  x .15 m = 15 m  of concrete mix;
assuming 1:123mix cement/sand and specific gravity
of 1.6 tons/m = 2.0 tons (15 x 0.083 x 1.6);
(ii)  walls = (10 m x 2.52m) = 25 m  - 3 m   (for doo5s
and windows) = 22 m  x 4 = 88 m  x .15 = 13.2 m;
assuming mix 1:4:8 cement/sand/gravel and specific
weight as in (i) = 1.75 tons (13.2 x 0.083 x 1.6);
and
(iii) floor and walls = 3.75 tons of cement.
(b) the amount of cement required for improvement is assumed to
equal 1/3 of the amount needed for new conssruction or 1.2
tons (based on the assumption th5t only 5 m of concrete
will be required instead of 15 m in the new house); and
(c) the amount required for surveyed plots is assumed to equal
2/3 of the amount required for the new house or 2.4 tons
(it is assumed that, in the absence of services, inhabitants
of surveyed plots will not proceed immediately to build high-
standard houses).
2.        It is assumed that the total amount of cement will be supplied over
a 5 year period. Hence column (4) = column (3)/5.

TANZANIA
SECOND NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
Small-Scale Industry Program
1.        The second project will include an experimental program of assis-
tance to the small-scale industry sector in Tabora and Tanga. This program
will be implemented by the Small Industries Development Organization (SIDO).
It would be the Bank group's first venture into the urban informal sector in
Tanzania and its first involvement with SIDO. The objectives of the program
are two-fold: first, to directly increase production and employment in the
project areas, diversifing the economic base; second, to strengthen SIDO's
programs and implementation capabilities in the urban sector, particularly at
the regional level. Total costs of the recommended program including loans
for worksheds and cluster infrastructure will be T Sh 14.8 million or approx-
imately US$1.8 million before contingencies. The program includes management
training and technical assistance, funds for hire-purchase of equipment, in-
frastructure for small industry clusters, and loans for construction of work-
sheds. Approximately 75% of project costs will be required in foreign exchange
since nearly all the equipment would have to be imported. This annex discusses
the program concept and institutional arrangements, program components,
expected benefits and SIDO's performance and prospects.
A.  Program Concept and Institutional Arrangements
2.        SIDO will be the major intermediary for the small-scale industry
program, building upon its present role as the government parastatal providing
integrated support to small industries, including management and technical
assistance through its regional staff and financial support through its
equipment hire-purchase scheme. The program will focus on increasing SIDO's
regional implementation and management capabilities, and developing project
promotion, preparation, technical and financial assistance capability that,
once refined, could later be applied in other regions throughout Tanzania.
3.        The National Bank of Commerce (NBC) will not receive project
finance; rather, it will continue in its present role, offering com-
plementary working capital finance once SIDO has prepared, appraised, and
approved a small industry as eligible under SIDO's hire-purchase scheme.
The small industry clients will continue to deal almost exclusively with
SIDO staff in acquiring equipment, construction, and working capital loans
since NBC and THB would rely on SIDO's feasibility studies and financial
packages. Since working capital funds required would be about T Sh 4 mil-
lion, no special Bank-NBC agreement will be necessary; this initial par-
ticipation equals less than .01% of NBC's annual lending, and NBC's head-
quarters management has stated that there would be no difficulty in extending



ANNEX 4
Page 2
this amount of working capital in Tanga and Tabora nor need for a special
project agreement. The project will fund appointment of a Regional SIDO
Credit Officer to do the promotion and preparation work for SIDO hire-purchase,
NBC working capital and (when necessary) THB construction loans; this person
could be transferred to NBC at the point that a specialized field staff were
organized within NPC. However, all indications from NBC Headquarters and
Regional Managers are that NBC will continue to rely on SIDO to do the promo-
tional, technical and supervisory work.   NBC has strong interest in sim-
plifying procedures for lending to small industries and would be willing to
introduce new procedures as part of the project in Tabora and Tanga Towns.
4.        Regional Focus.  Since this project would represent the Bank group's
first experience working with SIDO and on small industries in Tanzania, the
small industry component will limit its scope to two project towns, Tanga
and Tabora. A limited regional approach is necessary and appropriate at
this stage. Decentralized government administrative structure and the poor
internal communications make it necessary to improve regional programs and
staff. In SIDO as in most other government agencies, the regions constitute
the basic operating unit. The small-scale industry program is designed to
increase SIDO's regional and implementation capacity and develop procedures
which later would be applied throughout Tanzania. Experiences gained from
specific training and extension methods developed and used in Tanga and
Tabora will be transferred through an operating manual developed as part
of the program, to be used by all the regions. Improved procedures for
supervision, collections and financial controls for the hire-purchase scheme
will be installed and later implemented in other regions. Low-cost workshed
models will be designed by Ardhi in collaboration with SIDO for SSIs on and
off the clusters in Tanga and Tabora; these low-cost models could be copied in
other zones to transform the costly industrial estate approach into an econom-
ically viable scheme for work space.
5.        In urban areas, financial and technical assistance under the program
will be available to cooperatives, associations, sole artisans, and District
Development Corporations. The project would emphasize cooperative formation
building upon existing technical and marketing skills in the project areas.
Cooperative groups and individuals from other areas will also be eligible. The
main emphasis of the program will be on the upgrading of managerial, accounting
and marketing skills. The project will also provide new specialization and
diversification opportunities through the supply of equipment under hire-
purchase program. Grouping of artisans and productive units into larger
partnerships and cooperatives that would facilitate bulk purchase of inputs,
internal specialization and joint marketing will be encouraged.
6.        Priority Industries.  In selecting the priority subsectors,
preference has been given to industries utilizing local resources; employ-
ing labor-intensive technology; building upon existing technical skills



ANNEX 4
Page 3
while increasing specialization and/or market reach; developing forward
and backward linkages with existing larger industries in project towns;
and meeting regional demand for items traditionally imported into the region.
Particular emphasis was placed on industries that would enhance urban-rural
links and seLve surrounding rural areas and on the development of the building
materials industry.
7.        The detailed list of selected industries is shown in Tables 1 and 2
of this Annex. Selection was done in cooperation with SIDO's staff and is
based on an analysis of the regional potential of Tanga and Tabora. By
September 30, 1977, SIDO will prepare at least ten feasibility studies for
review by IDA. These feasibility studies will give special emphasis to
market potential and channels, raw material sourcing, criteria for selection
of participants, and organization aspects. Consultants support for additional
project preparation is available under technical assistance (see para 29
below).
8.        Some of the priority industries will be located in clusters near
the project areas; in Tanga the designated small industrial zone is between
the two project areas of Gofu Juu and Mwakizaro, while in Tabora the small
industry area is in the project area of Kiloleni (see para 18-20 below).
Other selected small industries will be scattered throughout the wards of
each town, but organized into cooperatives or joint ventures, forming networks
with common facilities for storage of raw materials and finished products as
well as for specialized machinery which individual small industry cooperatives
cannot afford.
9.        The priority industries provisionally selected for Tanga will:
(a) use waste or by-products from the parastatals (e.g.
shorts from the steel rolling mill for nuts, bolts,
hinges, and structural steel; gypsum board and plaster
of paris from wastes of the fertilizer plant; and edu-
cational equipment from the shorts from the sawmill;
(b) process some agricultural products (e.g. salt refining,
coir and sisal mats or ropes) and other natural resources
(wood industries, lime-based construction materials);
(c) manufacture products and implements needed by agriculture,
e.g., sisal knives, husking blades; and
(d) provide construction material and hardware materials,
e.g., nuts, bolts, hinges, lime building material,
joinery products.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
10.       In Tabora, the proposed priority industries would:
(a) specialize in products utilizing local resources
of cotton, wood and lime;
(b) supply needed services such as general engineering
workshops and garage;
(c) respond to the local demand for educational supplies,
agricultural implements and packaging.
B. Program Components
11.       The small scale industry program for Tabora and Tanga will involve
three major components: (a) expansion of SIDO Management Training and Tech-
nical Assistance programs and staff at the regional level to increase imple-
mentation capacity in the towns without diverting resources from the develop-
ment of rural industries; (b) funds for SIDO's program for hire-purchase of
production equipment and purchase of critical raw materials for participating
small industries; and (c) infrastructure for the industrial clusters as well
as provision for credit from THB for loans for low-cost industrial structures
and sheds. The costs of the program are summarized in Annex 6, Table 12.
Management Training and Technical Assistance
12.       Management and technical apprenticeships and training materials for
short, practical courses, e.g., on accounting or financial management, will
be funded under the project. In Management Apprenticeships, a prospective
industry manager or cooperative chairman could spend one to three months with
a successful industry with similar product lines and ownership structures to
learn the general management methods and problems in getting raw materials,
finding markets, managing money, organizing the work, costing products, etc.
The project will pay the participants' transportation and subsistence costs
as well as a stipend to the industry offering the the training.
13.       Project Implementation and Training Coordinators in each town will
be responsible for identifying and organizing productive groups which would
participate in the industrial clusters and networks. The Coordinator will
also be responsible for the start-up of the industries and for on-going manage-
ment assistance to the industries in Tanga and Tabora towns promoted under the
project. Working with Ardhi and appropriate regional and national administra-
tions, he will oversee the orderly settlement on the clusters and insure that
the service and facilities provided are properly maintained. In addition, he
will work with the Technical Adviser developing training programs and super-
vising management apprenticeships, short practical courses and exchanges among
artisans. Project Technical Advisers will be hired (probably from outside
Tanzania) in both Tanga and Tabora towns for a period of up to two years.
They will assist the Coordinator in starting new production cooperatives and



ANNEX 4
Page 5
other industries and will focus on developing management assistance and
training programs for cooperatives and SSI networks. In addition, they will
be responsible for developing an operating manual for technical assistance and
training program which could be used in other regions to assist small-scale
industry activities.
Hire Purchase of Equipment
14.       This component will build upon SIDO's existing Equipment Hire-Pur-
chase and Raw Material Bank Programs (see para 27(d) below). Over 85% of T Sh
7.8 million worth of equipment and raw materials made available under the
project will require foreign currency. About 60% of these funds have been
allocated to specific priority industries within the industry clusters and
networks (see Section A), while 20% will be available for incremental equip-
ment for existing small industries and for other subprojects (whose feasibil-
ity would be determined during the course of project implementation) and 20%
for critical raw materials difficult to obtain through normal distribution
channels. In addition, funds will be provided for contracting to install
equipment and provide critical technical training on the more unfamiliar
machinery. While most of the industries involve labor-intensive technologies,
nearly all of the equipment is imported and about half of the industries in
the clusters would require assistance by the equipment suppliers in installing
and technical training. SIDO has positive experience contrating foreign
machinery suppliers for this role.
15.       SIDO and its predecessor, the National Small Scale Industry Cor-
poration, have had hire-purchase schemes. With the one to two years grace
period, collections to date have been limited; however, analysis of the
portfolio shows that arrears rates are below 10%. Funds for the hire-pur-
chase program have recently been made available from various outside sources
(see para 28 below), and there is a need to formalize and standardize lending
and repayment procedures and terms and to establish a revolving hire-purchase
fund within SIDO. The project will provide assistance for this task.
16.       Project Coordinators in each town will be responsible for iden-
tifying and organizing new productive groups which would participate in the
Industrial Clusters and networks. They will also be responsible for coordi-
nating the start-up of the industries and providing on-going management
assistance to the new industries promoted in Tanga and Tabora under the
project. They will be assisted by Project Implementation Advisers in
starting new production cooperatives and other industries.
17.       Project Economist within SIDO's Tanga and Tabora offices will be
responsible for preparing feasibility studies and financial packages including
necessary equipment, credit and construction financing. The Project Economist
will be the project participants' link with NBC and THB, facilitating the
processing and repayments of credit.



ANNEX 4
Page 6
Infrastructure for Industrial Clusters
18.       To provide the needed space and infrastructure for small indus-
tries, three hectares (adjacent to the project areas) have been set aside
as small industries zones; in Tanga the designated small industrial zone is
between the two project areas of Gofu Juu and Mwakizaro, while in Tabora,
the allotted small industry area is in the project area of Kiloleni. The
project will provide funds for basic infrastructure--preparation of land,
roads, electricity, water supply and sewerage. Cost per hectare would be
about T Sh 110,000 (US$13,000) before contingencies. The infrastructure will
be supplied as a part of the upgrading works in project towns. Services on
and off clusters will be maintained by appropriate regional and national
agencies (Ardhi, Tanesco, Comworks, Regional Water Supply).
19.       Traditional industrial estates often involve expensive buildings
with costs exceeding the price of machinery and equipment. It is estimated
that building costs could be reduced to T Sh 700 (US$84) per square meter by
using a combination of traditional building materials and earthern floors,
with cement floors as needed for machinery. In several industries planned
for industrial clusters, basic infrastructure, combined with construction
of basic workshops and sheds with security are all that are needed. In
order to minimize costs, project participants will assume the responsibi-
lity for actual construction of sheds.
20.       T Sh 2.8 million (US$330,000 million) will be available to finance
low-cost sheds in Tabora and Tanga towns, on and off the clusters. Loans of
up to T Sh 120,000 will be made to program participants at interest rates of
8% with maturities of 15 years and up to two years' grace. Security and down
payments will be lower than THB's normal requirements for commercial under-
takings given the reduced size and new nature of the enterprises. Ardhi will
provide low-cost designs to meet the needs of various types of industries.
Local Project Coordinators will supervise construction with the assistance of
SIDO's staff.
C. Expected Benefits
21.       The small industry component will provide benefits in increasing
employment, incomes and production in Tanga and Tabora Towns. The component's
incremental employment of 870 people over 3 years would cost US$650 in fixed
investment per position created and less than US$1,000 including initial
working capital needs and technical assistance. This employment figure
includes those who were previously seriously underemployed. The majority
of the priority industries represent new product lines in these regions and
often in Tanzania as a whole; however, they build upon existing skills and
resource base. Many of the industries use local resources as inputs process-
ing them into finished products which were formerly imported; therefore, the
program will result in savings of foreign exchange for inputs and increase
local value added.



ANNEX 4
Page 7
22.       One major objective of the program is to strengthen SIDO's regional
implementation capacity and to develop methods in Tabora and Tanga which can
be applied elsewhere. The institution building benefits would include devel-
opment of:
(a) new, improved training and extension methods, transmitted
to other regions through manuals and seminars;
(b) regional management and implementation capabilities in
urban areas through addition of staff to perform key
functions;
(c) financial management under the hire-purchase scheme;
(d) low cost workshop clusters and networks to replace the
capital intensive industrial estate approach formerly
favored;
(e). coordination among SIDO, ARDHI, NBC and THB.
D. SIDO's Performance and Prospects
23.       SIDO - Background and Organization.  The small scale industry
program will be implemented by the Small Industries Development Organization
(SIDO). SIDO is a parastatal under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
It replaced the national Small Industries Corporation (NSIC), established
in 1966 as a subsidiary of the National Development Corporation (NDC).
According to a 1974 directive on small-scale industries, SIDO should not
run or own any industries. Rather, its role should be to render services
to new and existing small scale industries. Consequently, SIDO attempts
to assist all forms of the small-scale industry from simple self-employed
artisans to small factories, during all stages of their activities.
24.       SIDO is headed by a Director General who reports to a Board of
Directors headed by a Chairman who at present also serves as the Junior
Minister of Industries. The Director General is assisted by three Depart-
mental Directors of Research and Planning, Training and Marketing and Admini-
strative and Account Section. A small extension service has been estab-
lished in each region, staffed by one Small Industry Promotion Officer (SIPO)
and one Training Officer. Complementing the regional staff, there are Zonal
Economists covering three to four regions. The organization of SIDO is shown
in Figure 1.
25.       SIDO's Performance.  SIDO has been in operation for too short a
period to permit a definitive judgement on its performance and effectiveness.
Assistance to the small-scale industries is an experimental area in which few
countries have accumulated solid and transferable experience. Establishment
of programs and staff to assist small-scale industries is a long process.



ANNEX 4
Page 8
At present, large variations exist among regions in the quality of programs
and considerable improvements in SIDO strategic planning and staff are needed
to increase its impact on SSI development in urban and rural areas. Until
recently, physical development has been emphasized with 70% of SIDO's budget
in 1974/75 allocated to construction of industrial estates and urban workshops
in some regions. Additional attention is needed in initial organization of
industries, their management, quality control and marketing of final products.
Coordnation with other agencies and regional authorities is often insufficient.
Project preparation skills are generally satisfactory, although more attention
should be given to problems of marketing and organization.
26.       These problems can be partially attributed to the scarcity of quali-
fied manpower and resources. They also reflect the ambiguities of the original
strategy of SIDO and its evolution. One of the main ambiguities concerns the
ownership of industries. In ujamaa villages small industries can only be
operated by cooperatives, while in urban areas individuals and small partner-
ships as well as cooperatives are eligible for assistance. A related problem
is the role of small-scale industry in the national development strategy;
large parastatals are often promoted to meet the same demand as are the small
industries promoted by SIDO. Furthermore, no clear choice appears to have
been made between the view of small-scale industry as a social service
which provides employment and education, but whose economic viability is
secondary and which is to be subsidized; and a view of small-scale industry as
an economic viable entity, which has to satisfy the vigorous test of competi-
tion and which is not to be subsidized beyond a short start-up period.
27.       The services SIDO is providing include:
(a) Industrial consultancy and marketing services provided
by Regional SIDO staff.
(b) Training. Eight training-cum-production centers are presently
in operation, including one in Tabora, Muhezg and Tanga. They
serve as training and industrial extension nuclei, while
producing goods for local consumption. In addition SIDO
provides basic training of long duration and short refresher
courses for its staff. Until 1975, 55 engineering staff
have been sponsored abroad (mainly in India) for specialist
training.
(c) Industrial Estates and Clusters. SIDO is presently engaged in
the implementation of several industrial estate and production-
cum-training projects and has plans to take up five more
projects during the Third Five-Year Plan. A T Sh 4 million
estate in Dar es Salaam has been recently completed, as well
as a smaller estate in Songea. In Tanzania's Five-Year
Plan, SIDO is committed to developing industrial clusters of
estates in each regional center. These and other expansion
plans of SIDO would require continued external as well as
internal financing.



ANNEX 4
Page 9
(d) Hire-Purchase Programs for Machinery. SIDO has a
small hire-purchase program. SIDO's budget for 1975/76
included about T Sh 20,000 per region for hire-purchase
to small-scale industry but internal and external
funding has since increased. An initial deposit of 10% is
required prior to delivery. The balance is lent at 5%
for three to seven years (with up to one year grace period)
depending on the size of the loan and type of machines. The
repayment record appears satisfactory with arrears to date
less than 10%.
(e) Government Purchase Program. Government departments and
parastatal organizations are the largest buyers of indus-
trial products. Following a 1974 directive, SIDO arranged
a program in which government agencies are encouraged to
give preference to purchases from small industry producers.
In 1974, over T Sh 3.2 million worth of goods produced by
small-scale industries were purchased through SIDO.
(f) Raw Materials Supply. At present SIDO supplies its work-
shop network with raw materials and plans to extend
this service to other small-scale industries, using the
outlets of the Regional Trading Companies as well as
developing one or two Raw Material Banks for scarce items.
28.       SIDO has a variety of funding sources (including Treasury, India and
Scandinavian countries), each with a different perception of needed programs
of small industries and making funds available at different costs. SIDO faces
a major challenge in developing an integrated strategy and standardized
interest rates for its hire-purchase program.
29.       While the proposed program will be on too limited a scale to allow
for short term, direct impact on SIDO's national strategy, policies and
organization, the program will be used as an instrument of dialogue with
SIDO on these matters and regional approaches can form the basis for overall
reform in policies and procedures. Efforts will be made to strengthen SIDO's
capability in these areas where weaknesses have been acknowledged. The
project will focus on the regional level of SIDO operations and place strong
emphasis on managerial assistance and the process of project identification
and selection of participants. Assistance will also be provided to SIDO's
headquarters:
(a) to develop effective methods of management assistance to the
small-scale industry especially to cooperatives, on industrial
clusters, and off clusters, to decentralized networks of
industries;
(b) to improve the procedures, structure and performance of the
hire-purchase program and to formulate guidelines on lending
to small-scale industry; the interest rate will be increased
from 5% to 8% in order to bring it in line with interest
rates charged by NBC;



ANNEX 4
Page 10
(c) to formulate a policy on the development of ancillary
industries; and
(d)  to reinforce its marketing and management assistance
capabilities.
30.       Toward a Small-Scale Industry Project in Tanzania.  SIDO would
almost certainly be the prime mover if the Bank group eventually decided to
fund a nationwide small industries project in Tanzania. The major financial
intermediary could be NBC with SIDO providing project promotion, preparation,
evaluation, technical, management, and marketing advice and organization.
SIDO's management has stated that it would be amenable to the eventual estab-
lishment of a small industry fund within NBC. In this case, SIDO's hire-
purchase would most likely be maintained for use by small industries which
require small amounts of equipment to complement new product development
or product upgrading efforts.
31.       Several major changes would be required in NBC's strategy, staffing
and procedures before it could be expected to function as the major financial
intermediary for small industries. Until now, NBC has little commitment to
and experience in lending to small industries. Until 1975, NBC had lent less
than US$10,000 to small industries; in 1975-76 NBC's lending to small indus-
tries increased, but the amount was about US$1 million, less than .O1X of its
total annual lending. Most of NBC's small enterprise clients are retail
outlets which require standard working capital, usually keep books and require
little active involvement by NBC.
32.       A major limitation of NBC is its charter to lend only for working
capital needs; there was a small hire-purchase fund, which has been discon-
tinued in the regions visited due to lack of promotion. The headquarters
and regional managers claim that at present they would not be able to lend
for equipment or worksheds. Board-level discussions had been held on the
possible request for a change in NBC's mandate to include investment and
working capital, but no quick decision was foreseen.
33.       NBC has no specialized small industry staff or program; the accounts
department at both headquarters and regional branches handles agriculture,
commerce, large and small industry loans. In small industries, NBC relies
almost completely on the project appraisals of SIDO staff, with NBC providing
complementary working capital to SIDO's hire-purchase clients. Recognizing
their lack of personnel with experience in small industry lending, NBC's
management recently sent one member of their technical staff to India to
study small industries. This lack of specialization precludes NBC's active
promotion or information dissemination about the availability and terms of
credit to small industries. It also hinders the development of the project
preparation, technical and management assistance and loan supervision capa-
bilities that are needed to develop small industries in Tanzania. While SIDO
can do most of the extension work, some specialized small industry unit would
be needed within NBC to appraise projects SIDO prepares, provide some super-
vision and act as a link between SIDO and NBC.

ANNEX 5
TANZANIA
SECOND NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
Implementing Agencies and
Project Organization and Management
1.        This Annex provides a brief overview of the principal implement-
ing agencies and describes the administrative arrangements for the proposed
project. The distribution of responsibility for various administrative
functions described in the Annex is summarized in Figure 1 and an implemen-
tation schedule is presented in Figure 2.
2.        Responsibility for project implementation will be shared between
the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (Ardhi), which will be
designated as the Executing Agency with overall responsibility for the
project, and the decentralized administrations in each project town.
A. Central Project Administration
Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development
3.        Ardhi has overall responsibility for formulating and implementing
policies for urban development, particularly with regard to land use and
housing. It also assists the Prime Minister's Office in administering land
development in rural areas. In 1973 Ardhi was reorganized and some of its
staff decentralized as part of the regionalization of the Tanzanian Govern-
ment. Ardhi's current organization is indicated in Figure 3 and recent ex-
penditure patterns are shown in Table 1. 1/
4.        The ministry is confronted with a severe shortage of trained staff
(see Table 2). Less than two-thirds of the ministry's approved non-adminis-
trative posts in the technical grades are currently filled. The Ardhi
Institute, which began as a Survey Training Center, has been expanded to
provide training in urban and rural planning and land economics as well
as surveying. The institute currently has 21 faculty members. In 1976
approximately 75 students received professional diplomas after three years
of study, while another 100 earned subprofessional certificates in surveying
after a two-year course. The first diplomas and certificates in housing
design, construction and management will be granted in 1979. The institute
plans to train 342 diploma graduates and 520 certificate-holders by 1980.
The first project includes US$280,000 for expansion of the institute's
facilities.
1/   The reorganization of the ministry and its current organization are
discussed in Annex 2 of the appraisal report for the first project.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
Sites and Services Unit
5.        The Sites and Services Unit will have operational responsibility for
the planning and implementation of the project, as it did for the first
IDA-financed project. Although it has handled the design and construction of
the physical components of the first project satisfactorily, there have been
deficiencies in other aspects of project implementation. First, the social
aspects of the project have been given inadequate attention. At least par-
tially because they were not given assistance in relocating, a substantial
proportion of the families whose units were demolished because of upgrading
works have squatted elsewhere or become renters rather than moving to the
serviced plots allocated to them.
6.        Secondly, the Project Manager has been over-burdened.  Although
the unit is responsible for almost half of the ministry's development
expenditure, it had only sectional status and was headed by a fourth-tier
manager. The Project Manager was frequently given assignments not related
to the project and did not have authority for independent action commen-
surate with his units' responsiblities.
7.        Thirdly, insufficient attention has been paid to financial
management. Records have not been adequately maintained. The turnover
of accountants has been high and currently the position is filled by an
accounts assistant, who lacks qualification.
8.        Fourthly, insufficient guidance and support has been given to
local project administrators. A systematic approach to local project
management has not been developed, and there are no well established lines
of communication between Ardhi and local administrators. Consequently,
problems have had to be dealt with on a sporadic, ad hoc basis.
9.        Finally, although the Monitoring and Evaluation Team has provided
useful feedback about project implementation, problems of communication
and unclear responsibility have arisen because the team is supposed to
report to the Principal Secretary rather than to the Project Manager.
Furthermore, they cannot act as the Manager's representatives to recom-
mend remedial actions when problems are identified during site visits.
10.       In order to overcome these deficiencies in the proposed project the
Sites and Services Unit will be restructured and upgraded to divisional status
within the ministry (see Figure 4). Project management and community develop-
ment capabilities will be strengthened primarily by shifting established posts
into the new sections and converting a few of them into more senior positions.
The reorganization was approved by the Ministry of Manpower Development for
the beginning of the 1977/78 fiscal year. The organization plan adds only
three new technical positions to the unit, but will increase recurrent expen-
diture by 15-20% due to the upgrading of some posts.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
11.       The Division's Planning Section will function much as the existing
unit does. The section prepared preliminary site layouts and has been review-
ing the consultants' preliminary engineering and making appropriate modifica-
tions. Plans for the community facilities in the upgrading areas will be
prepared in consultation with the appropriate ministries and regional offi-
cials. The section will also work with local officials to select sites and
prepare layouts for the surveyed plot program.
12.       Because of the Engineering Section's limited capability, consult-
ants (John Burrow and Partners) were hired to prepare preliminary engineer-
ing designs for the proposed project, and the detailed engineering and some
supervision will also be handled by consultants. The engineering consult-
ancy contracts have been used to supplement on-the-job training begun under
the first project. Five of the first six trainees were seconded to work on
preliminary engineering and supervision with consultants, and the contract
for detailed engineering will incorporate similar opportunities for some
of the twelve remaining trainees. The capabilities developed through the
training program will enable the Engineering Section to assume some of the
responsibilities, such as the engineering for communities facilities and
the supervision of contractors at a few sites, handled by consultants in
the first project.
13.       Management and community development functions relatively neglected
during the first project will be strengthened under the second project. Three
management functions will be given particular attention. First, financial
management will be strengthened through recruitment of a Financial Analyst
using project technical assistance funds. The Financial Analyst will be
responsible for the maintenance of project accounts and preparation of reports,
budgets and cash flow projections and will be supported by a Tanzanian Accounts
Assistant.
14.       Secondly, more attention will be devoted to systematic monitoring
of project implementation and identification of problems needing special
attention.  (see Annex 11)   Effective performance of this function will
depend on the development of a simple management information system to provide
information to Ardhi and guide local administrators in planning and implement-
ing the project. In order to familiarize local administrators with project
implementation, the section will prepare a brief management handbook, includ-
ing standardized planning and reporting forms, and conduct an orientation
seminar in Dar es Salaam for local project administrators. The first draft of
the handbook was prepared between the appraisal mission and negotiations. The
unit will prepare periodic reports on the progress of project implementation
in each city based on standardized reports prepared by local administrators
and occasional visits to the cities.
15.       Finally, research studies will be conducted on specific topics which
cannot be monitored adequately through normal procedures. In order to carry
out these studies funds will be provided for hiring temporary interviewers,
reproducing questionnaires, and processing data.



ANNEX 5
Page 4
16.       The community development and lands staff will be responsible for
the social aspects of the project and will work closely with local officials
to ensure their effective implementation. Their specific responsibilities
will include publicity for the project, allocations and titles for the sur-
veyed plots, registration of squatter houses and preparation of titles, the
various forms of on-site assistance to be provided to residents in the project
areas, and the formation of housing cooperatives. During the planning phase
of the project, they will develop guidelines and prepare information materials
for the social components and work with local officials to plan their imple-
mentation. They will also visit the towns periodically to monitor progress
and provide assistance.
17.       On-Site Assistance.  Considerably more attention will be given
to explaining the project to community residents and to providing on-site
assistance than in the first project. The Sites and Services Unit will
prepare guidelines and standard information materials and work with local
officials to develop integrated service programs consisting of some or all of
the following elements:
(i)  publicity about the project, emphasizing provision of
compensation and relocation assistance to households
displaced by the improvements, procedures to be followed
in the registration of houses and the availability of
THB house improvement loans;
(ii)  type plans for house improvement and construction, which
will be sold at the site offices at prices set to recover
reproduction costs;
(iii)  three to five demonstration houses, including scale models
showing different stages of construction, in each city;
(iv)  technical assistance in house improvement and construction
to be provided by artisans;
(v)  relocation assistance to households displaced by upgrading
works, including early payment of compensation and selection
of an alternative site, assistance in applying for.a THB loan,
and transportation for moving possessions; 1/ and
(vi) assistance in the formation of housing cooperatives, to be
provided by local Cooperative Officers following guidelines
developed by Ardhi.
These forms of assistance will be available through site offices in
the demonstration houses.
1/   A truck to be purchased by Ardhi for transporting the Mobile Survey
Crew from town to town will also be used to relocate displaced
households.



ANNEX 5
Page 5
18.       S;veying for the surveyed plot program will be done by an Ardhi
Mobile SUGVz7 Crew consisting of three surveyors and ten technical assis-
tants. Field assistants will be supplied by the Regional Surveyors or hired
locally, and survey students from Ardhi Institute will gain field experience
working with the program. The crew will be organized in two teams, each
consisting of 5 technical assistants and 20 field assistants under a sur-
veyor. It will alternate between trips of two to three months to the regional
capitals and periods of work in Dar es Salaam. As indicated in para 5.04 of
the report the Sites and Services Unit will be responsible for the overall
scheduling and coordination of the surveyed plot program.
B. Local Project Management
19.       In 1974 Tanzania's administrative and political structures were
decentralized in an effort to shift important decision-making power to local
bodies. The structure now consists of the Central Government, 20 regions,
over 70 districts and sub-districts in some localities. Among project
cities, Dar es Salaam is a separate region with three districts, Tanga
is a district, and Tabora, Iringa and Morogoro are sub-districts.
20.        Figure 5 provides a schematic overview of the national administra-
tive structure. At both the regional and district levels teams of functional
officers operate under the leadership of Development Directors. Sub-district
teams are led by Assistant District Development Directors (ADDD's) and have
fewer functional officers. Planning Officers responsible for financial
planning and administrative coordination assist the Development Directors.
Although the functional officers follow policies set by their ministries,
they are responsible to their Development Directors for local administrative
matters.
Local Project Management: Overview
21.       In the first project primary responsibility for local project ad-
ministration was assigned to the Regional Land Development Officers (RLDO's).
These offices are part of the regional administrations under the Regional
Development Directors (RDD's) and are responsible for physical planning,
surveying, land valuation, and allocations. Experience with the local
administration of the first project has indicated two general shortcomings
of this arrangement. First, no single local official has explicit overall
operational responsibility for the local implementation of the project,
resulting in ambiguities about responsibility for solving problems and
communication difficulties locally and with Ardhi. Second, there is no
formal mechanism for ensuring that the various local officials who need
to be involved in the project make the required inputs on schedule.



ANNEX 5
Page 6
22.       A more formal, systematic approach to local project management
will be employed in the proposed project. Teams of local officials under
the direction of Project Coordinators designated by the RDD's will be
responsible for local implementation. The Assistant Development Officer,
District Planning Officer or one of Ardhi's decentralized staff members will
be designated Project Coordinator. The Coordinators' responsibilities will be
to plan local project implementation with assistance from the Sites and
Services Unit, to coordinate the activities of the various local officials
involved in the project, and to monitor progress and submit periodic reports
to their RDD's and Ardhi. The Coordinators will either establish formal
Project Committees or rely on less formal coordination mechanisms.
23.       The Project Coordinators are not expected to devote full time
to the projects; their involvement is likely to vary from a few hours to
several days a week. A Site Officer (a junior official with technical
skills in construction) will be appointed in each project town to assist
the Coordinator and to ensure a continuous administrative presence in the
project communities. The Site Officers (as well as other officials) will
work out of demonstration houses to be built on the sites. The Site Officers
represent the only increment to the local administrations planned for the
local management of the projects. Other officials will participate in
project execution as part of their regular administrative duties.
24.       The success of this approach to local project administration will
be heavily dependent on the guidance and support provided by the Sites and
Services Unit. The orientation seminar in Dar es Salaam for local project
administrators will provide an opportunity to familiarize them with adminis-
trative requirements of the project. The management materials prepared for
local administrators will identify the major tasks in project execution,
indicate their interrelationships, and suggest simple management tools such as
planning and monitoring charts. A project implementation schedule worked out
between the local administrators and Ardhi will indicate specific targets
which can be used to plan local activities and to monitor progress. The
management assistance to be provided to Ardhi under the project is described
in Annex 8.
Upgrading Program
25.       Tenure.  House-owners in the upgrading areas will be issued titles
based on house rather than plot occupation. 1/ The titles will be issued
for five years and normally be renewed automatically. They will specify
1/   Tanzania's land tenure system is described in Annex 6 of the appraisal
report of the first project. The most salient features of the system
are that land was nationalized in 1963 and that land use is normally
governed by short (usually annual) or long-term (usually 33 years)
rights of occupancy issued by Ardhi.



ANNEX 5
Page 7
annual charges which can be revised with six months advance notice. Title-
holders will be obligated not to erect additional buildings or transfer
their holdings without permission from the District Land Office. The titles
will be convertible to standard rights of occupancy if the holder arranges
for the effective plot on which the house stands to be surveyed and registered.
House-owners will be required to pay fees of approximately T Sh 90 for title
preparation and registration and stamp duty in order to obtain a title. The
legal title form to be used to grant tenure in the upgrading areas was re-
viewed and revisions agreed at negotiations. 1/
26.       The Site Officers will work closely with local leaders to ensure
community involvement in the project. CCM is organized in ten-house cells
at the local level and is particularly strong in some of the project
communities. In 1977 Ward Assemblies and Councils will be elected according
to the Urban Wards (Administration) Act, 1976. These bodies are intended
to complete the process of decentralization by creating popular bodies
which can participate in decision-making at the grassroots level in the
urban areas. Either the Construction and Transportation Committee which
each Ward Council must establish or a specifically constituted project
subcommittee will serve as the principal formal link between the community
and the project administration. Working relationships will be developed
with key local leaders.
Surveyed Plot Program
27.       Allocation of Plots.  The RLDO's are responsible for the allocation
of surveyed plots. Arrangements for allocation of the plots included in the
program will begin before completion of the surveying. Because the program
will involve a substantial number of new plots, their availability will be
publicized in existing low-income communities, and information about house-
holds on the waiting list will be updated. Final decisions about alloca-
tions are made by District Allocation Committees consisting of administrators,
elected representatives and CCM officials on the basis of files prepared
by the RLDO's.
28.       Allocations will be made on the basis of a point system weighted
to favor households with monthly incomes below T Sh 1,000 (US$120) a month.
It is Government policy to promote mixed-income communities and housing
opportunities are scarce for even better-off households in Tanzania because
of the weakness of the private sector. Therefore, although applicants in the
1/   The legal form will be called an "Offer of a Right of Occupation and
Use". This type of instrument is normally used for land which can be
adequately identified even though it has not been surveyed. R.W. James
notes that "the expression 'offer of a right of occupancy' is misleading
because the document is not a mere offer, but it is a final document
embodying agreed terms" (Land Tenure and Policy in Tanzania, p. 122).



ANNEX 5
Page 8
target group will be given preference, households with monthly incomes
over T Sh 1,000 will not be absolutely excluded. Other criteria to be
considered, but given lower weightings in the point system will include
number of dependents, employment status and length of time on the
waiting list for plots. Assurances were obtained from Government at
negotiations that the allocation procedures will give strong preference
to households in the target income group.
29.       Tenure.  Following Government policy, long-term rights of occupancy
issued for 33 years will be employed in the surveyed plot areas. Responsibil-
ity for the issuance of rights will be shared between the Land Offices and
Ardhi following standard procedures. Allottees are informed of their selec-
tion and receive a Letter of Offer specifying fees which must be paid to
obtain title. Based on annual Land Rent and Service Charges of T Sh 75 for
unserviced plots, these fees typically amount to about T Sh 130 plus the Land
Rent and Service Charge due for the remainder of the year (Table 3). However,
Ardhi has agreed to revise the survey fee schedule during 1977 to recover the
actual average cost of surveying plots and the review of the Land Rent and
Service Charge is likely to result in higher annual charges. Therefore the
level of the initial fees will also increase. If the fees are not paid within
a month, the Government is entitled to reallocate the plot.
30.       After being notified that an allottee has paid the required fees,
Ardhi's Land Development Division in Dar es Salaam assigns a Land Office
Number to the newly opened plot file, secures a deed plan from the Survey
Division and prepares a Certificate of Occupancy. The certificate is then
sent to the Land Office and the allottee is notified to report to sign it.
The signed certificate is then returned to Dar es Salaam for the signature
of the Director of Land Development Services and forwarded to the Registrar
of Titles who registers it and returns a copy to the allottee.

TANZANIA
SECOND NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
Design Standards and Cost Estimates
A. Physical Planning
Squatters Upgrading
1.        Settlement selection.  A detailed evaluation of existing squatter
areas in the five project towns was carried out before selecting the nine
settlements for upgrading under the project. The selection criteria
included:
(a) Socio-economic Characteristics of the Community and Housing
Conditions
-    socio-economic vitality of the community;
-    permanency, quality of building materials and general
condition of dwellings; and
-    potential for upgrading and housing improvement.
(b) Availability of Off-Site Infrastructure
-    proximity of existing trunk roads, primary and
secondary distributors;
-    proximity of existing water supply reticulation,
storage and treatment works;
-    proximity of existing storm culverts, streams and
ditches; and
-    proximity of existing power and telephone lines.
(c) Extent and Condition of Existing On-Site Infrastructure
-    pattern of existing circulation network and access
reserves, if any; and
-    types of sanitary facilities, water supply and
drainage.
(d) Physical Characteristics of the Site and Land-Use Patterns
-    topography, ground conditions and natural drainage of
site;
-    scale or size of the site and patterns of land use:
space available for infrastructure and community
facilities;
-    density of dwellings.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
(e) Access to Employment Opportunities
-    extent and potential of informal sector within site;
and
-    distance, availability and cost of transport to existing
employment areas.
(f) Relationship to General Planning Framework
-    conformity with existing patterns of development; and
-    development potential and constraints within planning
context for future growth.
2.        Squatter settlements were ranked according to these criteria
and areas most in need of improvement and with the best opportunities
for successful implementation were identified.
3.        Site Plans.  For each of the selected settlements Ardhi planners
carried out surveys and designed circulation layouts on aerial photographs,
conforming as far as possible to existing patterns of development. Adequate
provision of space has been made for community facilities at convenient
locations in each settlement. The consultants prepared engineering designs
for infrastructure on the basis of these site plans using standards described
in Section B of this Annex.
Surveyed Plots
4.        Site Selection.  The process of selecting suitable sites for
surveyed plots will be critical to the program's success. A systematic
and rational approach to the evaluation of available sites will be developed
and employed by Ardhi. Table 1 lists the criteria to be considered in the
evaluation. Sites with the greatest potential will be identified through
this process.
5.        The Physical Planning Section of Ardhi's Sites and Services Divi-
sion will be responsible for providing guidelines and assistance to regional
urban planning offices for preparing site plans for the selected sites.
The site plans will incorporate the following planning and design considera-
tions:
(a) adequate land use planning to ensure maximum locational
convenience of housing areas, community facilities areas
and circulation networks in terms of access, safety and
social interaction and to minimize costs;
(b) adequate provision of land for community facilities, i.e.,
schools, clinics, community centers, markets, day care
centers, etc.;



ANNEX 6
Page 3
(c) grouping of plots for community facilities to form an
attractive, viable nucleus for community activities and
to permit multiple uses of building and play areas;
(d) provision of a safe, convenient system of pedestrian
circulation linking lots to future bus lines, play areas
and community facilities;
(e) provision of vehicular circulation within the area which
will allow access to residential lots, commercial and
public areas and permit an easy flow of traffic while
protecting the neighborhoods from through traffic;
(f) provision of limited car parking and access for garbage
pick-up facilities;
(g) designing of lot layouts to reflect local social preferences
and life styles, and to minimize disturbances such as traffic
noises, industrial activities and natural nuisances;
(h) efficient physical planning to comply with desirable ranges
of population density 1/ and land use percentages 2/ for
circulation, public areas, private areas and lot coverage--
all features of a sound physical layout which is the primary
determinant of subsequent commitment in terms of cost of
land, infrastructure networks, administration and maintenance;
(i) convenient location of the initial standpipe cluster for
provision of potable water; and
(j) planning and design provision for staged installation of
basic services in the future. The requirements of each
utility will be considered individually (i.e., roads,
footpaths, stormwater drainage, water supply, power supply
and security lighting) and allowance made for incremental
upgrading from initial levels of service which may be lower
than desirable minimums.
1/   Defined in this instance as the number of persons divided by total
usable area. Desirable/effective gross population density range in
such projects is 250-500 persons per ha.
2/   Based on standards developed by several international agencies,
academic institutions and public planning agencies, these ranges
are: 20-30% for circulation areas, 50-60% for private areas,
and 15-30% for other public areas.



ANNEX 6

B. Infrastructure Standards
6.        In designing the infrastructure, standards employed in the first
project (see Annex 5 of Report 337a-TA) were utilized with appropriate
modifications. As in the first project, minimum functional requirements
were considered in determining initial levels of services and provision
was made in the engineering plans for future upgrading as needed. Infra-
structure cost estimates for the various sites are summarized in Tables 3
and 4. Detailed breakdown of cost estimates for a typical site, Kiloleni
(Tabora), are shown in Table 5 for reference.
7.        Roads.  Each site will have a network of collector, primary,
secondary and pedestrian roads. To the extent possible, layouts of the
networks conform to existing patterns of circulation and housing. Design
specification for the four different roads will be as follows:
(i) Collector Roads (Class A) are designed to serve as the main
access routes linking the sites with the urban road network.
They would accommodate heavy vehicles including bus traffic
which will be provided after upgrading works are completed.
Class A roads will have an overall reservation of 36 meters
with an initial carriageway width of six meters. The carriage-
way construction comprises a treated dry macadam surfacing
(20 mm double surface dressing on 150 mm base course) on
mechanically stabilized gravel base (200 mm sub-base). The
edges of the pavement will be strengthened with concrete
border curbs. 4.5 m wide shoulders are provided on both
sides for pedestrians and cyclists and for future expansion
of the carriageway.
(ii) Primary roads (Class B) will serve as the main vehicular
access to dwelling groups for taxis, garbage trucks, cesspit
emptiers, fire engines as well as private cars. These roads
will have an overall reservation of 24 meters with a 4.5 m
wide carriageway of rolled gravel on mechanically stabilized
gravel (150 mm base course). 3.25 m shoulders are provided
on both sides.
(iii) Secondary Roads (Class C) are dirt roads which will serve as
vehicular access to inner areas for light traffic and occasional
service and emergency vehicles. The road has a 12 m reserve
with a 5 m carriageway of compacted earth.
(iv) Pedestrian Paths (Class D) will function as pedestrian and
cyclist accesses to houses as well as emergency vehicles.
The D-roads will have a road reserve of six meters.



ANNEX 6

8.        vat2r Supply. 1/  Potable water will be supplied through
standpipes 'n all project areas. The design of on-site distribution
systems for squatter upgrading areas is based on the assumption that the
percentage of population served through public standpipes will decrease
over time from 100% in 1976 to 70% in 1986. Accordingly, the primary
distribution reticulation comprising pipes of diameter 75 mm or more,
is designed to meet the water demand of 1986. Water velocity is about
one m/sec in the primary distribution pipes. The secondary distribution
lines comprising pipes of diameter less than 75 mm are designed to meet
the demand from standpipes. The number of taps in one standpipe is limited
to four to avoid crowding. A 4-tap standpipe is expected to serve 50 plots.
Fire hydrants are provided only around community facilities and are spaced
at 300 m intervals.
9.        The specific water demand criteria adopted were 40 liters per
capita (lcd) for people served through pjblic standpipes, 100 lcd for people
served thrSugh private connections, 30 m /ha/day for community facilities
and 17.5 m /day per school. Water losses totalling 12% of consumption have
been taken into account to calculate the total water demand. Peak water
demand factors have been estimated at 1.20 for the peak day and 2.9 for
the peak hour. The future annual population growth adopted in the squatter
areas was assumed to be 5%, except in Mtoni-Tandika and Hanna Nassif in Dar
es Salaam where 2% growth only was adopted. These figures are based on
growth records of the various towns and particularities of each project
area.
10.       For the surveyed plots the standards of water supply distribution
systems would be limited to the simplest. Full on-site water supply
reticulation would not be laid. Provision is made in the project for water
mains, designed for an average per capita consumption of 40 liters/day, of
0.5 mile maximum length which would supply water to each project site through
public standpipes only. The number of standpipes would be limited to one
per 350 plots. The other criteria used to design the water main would be
the same as for squatter areas.
11.       Surface Water Drainage.  The drainage system is designed to carry
storm water and domestic waste water other than sewereage from latrines.
The system is designed for peak storm frequency of five years and consists
of unlined open ditches along the roads and through culverts at vehicular
crossings. On steep gradients lining will be provided to prevent erosion.
1/   The status of off-site water supply networks and general water
infrastructure for each town is summarized in Table 2 of this
Annex.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
12.       Sanitary Sewerage.  As in the first project, the traditional
pit latrine will be used for sanitary sewerage. In the upgrading areas,
pit latrines already exist in the majority of houses. Construction
and maintenance of pit latrines is the responsibility of project bene-
ficiaries. Technical assistance is provided by Ardhi for this. When
the pit latrine is full, it either has to be emptied or a new one built.
Cesspit emptiers provided under the project would empty pit latrines in
project areas in Dar es Salaam and Tabora. Where soil conditions and
ground water tables are unsuitable, house-owners would be encouraged to
install an alternative drycell system for which technical assistance and
loans from THB would be provided.
13.       Power Supply.  A system of street lighting and security lighting
at major communal areas will be installed. The center-to-center spacing
for street lighting will vary within a maximum spacing of about 50 m on
Class A and B roads. The distribution system will be designed to allow
for future individual metered connections which would be installed by
TANESCO on application.
Cost Estimates
14.       Detailed cost estimates for infrastructure, community facilities,
vehicles and equipment, technical assistance, house improvement and con-
struction loan program and the small-scale industries component are shown
in Tables 3, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12, respectively. Table 4 describes unit
costs for infrastructure works for squatter upgrading. Table 5 contains
the detailed costs of infrastructure works for a typical upgrading site
(Kiloleni, Tabora--the total project infrastructure costs for squatter
upgrading were aggregated from similar data on each site). Table 6 shows
cost estimates for basic infrastructure (water) for surveyed plots and
Table 8 describes unit costs and space standards for community facilities.
All costs are expressed in mid-1977 prices.

SECOND NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
General Water Supply Infrastructure for Project Sites
Project Town                           Status of Water Supply
Dar es Salaam:       The lower Ruvu River scheme financed by the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) has increased
the production and transmisSion capacity of t1e water
supply system from 95,000 m /day to 263,000 m /day.
The new facilities were commissioned at the end of 1976.
In addition, KfW has recently financed the expansion
of distribution reservoir capacity and transmission
mains in the town. No off-site mains would have to be
laid to supply the project areas except for the (Mbagala)
area where an off-site water main has been included under
the project to strengthen the supply of the on-site
distribution system.
Tanga:               The Siggi River scheme financed by KfW will make up for
the deficit in water production capacity of the bore-
holes presently supplying the town. The new T Sh 165
(US$20) million scheme consists of a dam, raising
mains, a treatment plant and new storage tanks. There
will be more than sufficient capacity to supply the
project areas. The scheme is presently under imple-
mentation and will be substantially completed before
construction of the reticulations of the present
project begins.
Tabora:              A new T Sh 83 (US$10) million extension scheme financed
also by KfW will make up for the deficit in water pro-
duction capacity of the Iyembe River Scheme presently
supplying the town. The new scheme includes capacity
for development in upgrading areas of the project. It
is under implementation and will be completed before
commissioning the reticulations to be built under the
project.
Morogoro:            New production, transmission and distribution facilities
have just been financed mainly by the Bank (Urban Water
Supply Project). The new T Sh 125 (US$15) million
scheme will increase the peak production capacity of the

Project Town                           Status of Water Supply
water supply system from 2,300 m  /day to 27,300 m /day.
It includes the construction of an 1,650 m long earth
dam across tqe Ngerengere River for storage of up to
10 million m of water, transmission pipelinS a treat-
ment plant and a pumping station of 25,400 m /day
capacity.  It also includes the 3construction of dis-
tribution reservoirs of 5,450 m total capacity and
the extension of the main distribution networks to
bring it up to an efficient state by early 1979. The
new facilities are expected to be commissioned by
October 1979.
Iringa:              A feasibility study for expansion of the water supply
system in Iringa has been completed (and appraised by
-the Bank in conjunction with six other urban water
supplies) but financing has not been found to date.
Existing production facilities are incapable of meeting
present needs 3(water production has levelled off at
2,200-2,500 m /day since 1971) and average per capita
consumption in the town is very low (45 lcd). The
present system is therefore incapable of serving addi-
tional reticulation without the risk of reducing
pressure in the pipes which would cause network
contamination and health hazards. The squatter
settlement included for upgrading under the project,
Kihesa, has some water service -- through 93 private
connections and 7 public standpipes. Therefore, a
limited strengthening only is proposed under the
project until funds (US$4.7 million) are available
to finance increased production and transmission
facilities in the town.

L  Experience of the First Project indicated significant differences in the cost of infrastructure works between Dar es Salsm and
upcountry towns. These difference reflect higher transportation costs and generally higher costs of construction in upcountry
towns -- lack of skilled manpower, inadequate maintenance facilities and poor cammunication with Dar es Salaam. In the absence
of reliable data or unit construction costs in upcountry towns, a location allowance expressed as a percentage of infrastructure
cost for Dar es Salaam was derived for each of the upcountry towns (30% for Tabora, 12.5% for Tanga, 7.5% for Morogoro and 28%
for Iringa) on the basis of consultants' and Ardhi's experience.                                                                                                                          4

TANZANIA
SECOND NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
Cost Recovery of Urban Infrastructure
1.        This annex discusses the approach to recovery of urban infra-
structure investment and maintenance costs from its direct beneficiaries,
to be adopted in the second project. After a review of present fiscal
arrangements in Tanzania, in particular of the Land Rent and Service
Charge, and the experience of the first project, the proposed approach
to the cost recovery in the second project is discussed.
A. Background
2.        Fiscal Policies in Tanzania.  The present fiscal system was
established in the context of decentralization reform introduced in May 1972.
Its principal characteristics are:
(a) the preference for general rather than specific forms of
taxation, in order to ensure a near uniformity and greater
progressivity in tax burdens across the territory;
(b) the centralization of assessment and collection machinery
in the hands of the Treasury. 1/
An effort to reduce the share of local taxation in the total tax burden and
equalize local tax burdens began in 1969. Between 1970 and 1972, the
share of local taxes (principally Urban House Tax and Vehicle Tax) as a
proportion of central government revenue fell from 5Z to 1.4%. A variety
of local taxes were abolished and/or consolidated into single levies such
as the Land Rent and Service Charge (see para 3 below). In may 1972, local
governments were abolished and regional and district administrations which
took their place have no taxing powers. Money collected locally for any
purposes (even market dues) goes to the center where broad expenditures
decisions are made and spending authorization given. Any geographical
link between revenues and expenditures has thus been broken. In such
a system, which deliberately seeks to use taxation as a direct distribu-
tion tool, user charges become an exception rather than the rule as
few public services have the necessary fiscal autonomy. Consequently,
the notion of cost recovery does not appear to play a significant role
in the design of fiscal policies.
1/   For a more detailed discussion of the fiscal system after decentrali-
zation see Bank Report No. 587-TA "Tanzania: Fiscal Aspects of
Decentralization."



ANNEX 7

3.        Land Rent and Service Charge.  In line with its general policies,
in July 1974 the Government abolished a variety of local property taxes and
land rates, replacing them with a single levy called the Land Rent and Service
Charge. The Land Rent and Service Charge is assessed on the economic value of
the unimproved land, which should reflect several criteria (location, level of
services, land use, etc.). However, as no specific official formula exists,
the economic value is determined by the valuers of the Land Valuation Section
of Ardhi on a case-by-case basis. In the absence of up-to-date valuations,
the 1969 valuation rolls are increased by 25% and used. The responsibility
for collection of the Land Rent and Service Charge lies, as for other taxes,
with the Treasury.
4.        The level of revenue from the Land Rent and Service Charge is
not determined by urban infrastructure financing needs but by general
budgetary considerations and by the pace of Ardhi's valuation. The
latter is slow, hampered by the lack of resources and manpower and
somewhat cumbersome and time-consuming valuation methods. Furthermore,
there are delays in transmitting the updated valuation rolls from Ardhi
to Treasury. Finally, because of the equivocal wording of the Act, the
charge is not levied at all in unsurveyed areas. All this leads to
considerable underestimation of the potential revenues of the Land Rent
and Service Charge. Thus, for example, the 1974/75 Land Rent and
Service Charge revenues for Dar es Salaam were estimated at T Sh 20
million. A recent evaluation of property values for just one street in
Dar es Salaam put them at T Sh 18.6 million. The total revenue for Land
Rent and Service Charge was estimated at T Sh 40 million in 1974/1975,
T Sh 30 million in 1975/1976, and T Sh 50 million in 1976/77.
5.        The collection of the Land Rent and Service Charge is very poor.
In FY 1975, out of the estimated revenues of T Sh 40 million, only about
T Sh 23 million were collected. Arrears are big and growing. The poor
record is due to the inefficient collection machinery, inadequate record
keeping, understaffing and lack of simple enforcement procedures as well
as the attitude of many urban dwellers, who are not accustomed to paying
for public services.
6.        While the 1972 reform specifically sought to transfer public
expenditures from urban to rural areas, its impact was accentuated by the
general budgetary crisis and lower than the expected yield of new levies
such as Land Rent and Service Charge. The result was a heavy fall in
resources available for urban areas, in real as well as in absolute terms.
Thus, the annual recurrent expenditures for building works in Dar es
Salaam dropped from T Sh 3.9 million in 1973 to T Sh 1.5 million in 1975.
The lack of funds for maintenance and low urban infrastructure investment
caused a large-scale deterioration of urban infrastructure. Costly stop-
gap remedial measures became necessary. Recently, for example, the
Ministry of Works had to undertake a costly program (T Sh 25 million
or US$3 million) of road repairs in Dar es Salaam.



ANNEX 7

B. First Project Experience
7.        In the first project, an attempt was made to introduce the
practice of capital cost recovery from direct beneficiaries of project
investment. The formula agreed between the Government and the Bank was
designed to recover on a site-per-site basis the assignable capital cost
of the infrastructure investments over 25 years at 9% interest. 1/
8.        The implementation of the formula encountered serious difficul-
ties. The major problem was that the proposed formula applied only to the
sites financed under the project, while plot charges for other sites were
determined by the Land Rent and Service Charge Act, enacted in mid-1974.
In effect, a distinct fiscal regime was proposed for the project. Further-
more, there was a considerable disparity in the level of charges under the
two regimes, with charges for project areas being considerably higher than
charges for comparably serviced areas outside the project. This provoked a
generally negative reaction from potential project beneficiaries. Its con-
sequences were a sluggish take-up pace for the payments of project plots fees
and political pressures on Ardhi to reduce the charges to a level comparable
with other urban areas.
9.        In October 1976, at the request of the Government, a Bank super-
vision mission reviewed the cost recovery formula for the first project in
order to bring the plot charges in line with the Land Rent and Service Charge
Act. In February 1977 IDA approved an amendment to the Credit Agreement which
would allow the recovery of 75% of the capital costs over 25 years at 9%
interest. Details of the proposed charges for each project area as well as
cost recovery coefficients are shown in Table 1. For the sites and services
areas those charges are based on the charges levied in comparably serviced
areas recently revalued by the Land Valuation Section of Ardhi. For the
squatter upgrading areas, the charge was set at T Sh 100, which is 33% higher
than the current charge for unserviced areas. This level of charges is
considered an interim solution to be modified after the overall review of the
Land Rent and Service Charge (see para 12 below).
C. Proposed Approach for the Second Project
10.       The experience of the first project plainly indicates the in-
feasibility of a cost recovery formula which applies only to project
areas. Furthermore, such a formula is not acceptable to the Government.
1/   Further details can be found in the appraisal report of the first
project (Report No. 337a-TA of May 12, 1974).



ANNEX 7
Page 4
Charges in project areas will therefore be determined by the Land Rent and
Service Charge Act of 1974 as amended and specified following recommendations
of the study discussed below (see para 12).
11.       While the interim solution, adopted for the First Project, repre-
sents a considerable improvement over the existing situation (see para 9
above), it is not fully satisfactory as it does not address the larger problem
of financing capital and maintenance expenditures of urban infrastructure.
There is growing concern in Government about these matters in view of recent
deterioration of urban infrastructure. A review of the existing system of
financing urban investment and financing costs has been recently initiated by
the Government.
12.       The necessary upward revision of the charges under the Land Rent
and Service Charge Act should take place in the context of this review for
which IDA's assistance was sought by Ardhi. As a part of the review, an
in-depth study of the Land Rent and Service Charge is being conducted. Since
the Land Rent and Service Charge is the principal tax on urban land use
and services as well as the instrument of cost recovery in the first project,
the study provides both a suitable vehicle for a dialogue with Government on
the financing of urban infrastructure and maintenance costs and a deter-
mination of specific arrangements for the second project. The study is re-
viewing all aspects of the Land Rent and Service Charge: valuation, assess-
ment, collection and enforcement. Its emphasis is practical: How to define a
simple, workable formula for valuation, which would reflect the value of
services provided? How to update valuation rolls? How to improve the collec-
tion process? What are the costs of shifting from annual to monthly collec-
tion? Its recommendations would apply to all urban areas in Tanzania. The
study was conceived as a short-term undertaking to be completed in six months.
Government has already engaged consultants who began work in February 1977.
The terms of reference for the study which were approved by IDA are shown as
Attachment 1. Financing for the study is included under the project. A
retroactive financing for the study under the project is recommended (see para
4.17).
13.       An inception report for the study, prepared by consultants, was
reviewed during negotiations. Agreements were reached regarding short-term
measures, guiding principles for the long-term reform of the Land rent and
Service Charge and arrangements for the cost recovery in the project. As a
short-term measure, Government agreed to progressively introduce the Land Rent
and Service Charge in all squatter areas in Tanzania. This introduction would
be linked to the program of house registration and tenure regularization (see
para 5.09 and Annex 5, para 25). The charge would be set initially at T Sh
100 annually and revised upward periodically.
14.       The specific recommendations of the study for the reform of the
Land Rent and Service Charge and then review by IDA and the Government will
be guided by the following three principles:



ANNEX 7
Page 5
(a) Sai-f-sufficiency of the urban sector. The cost of providing
an? maintaining urban land development and service infrastruc-
ture should be borne to the extent feasible by the urban
population in order to avoid having the rural population
subsidize these costs.
(b) Close relationships between expenditures on, and revenues
from, urban land development and service infrastructure.
The Land Rent and Service Charge should be closely related
to the cost of the provision and maintenance on regional/
local basis of urban land development and service infra-
structure. The charge should be flexible in order to meet
the incremental cost resulting from new programs.
(c) Structure of the Land Rent and Service Charge. The structure
of the Land Rent and Service Charge should be simple in order
to expedite the valuation process.  However, the Land Rent
and Service Charge should also differentiate between different
users in order to permit a control of demand and supply of
urban services and effect a better allocation of resources
and activities. The valuation and differentiation of the
charge should be based on the following three main criteria:
(i) plot size; (ii) land use; and (iii) level of services.
15.       The final report, to be completed in August 1977, will be reviewed
jointly by IDA and the Government. Before December 30, 1977, an agreement
will be reached regarding the cost recovery arrangements for the urban
infrastructure expenditures in the project--level and composition of plot
(house charges) as well as applicable revision and collection procedures.

TANZANIA
SECOND NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
Land Rent and Service Charge Study
Terms of Reference
1.        The broad purpose of the proposed study is two-fold:  (a) to
analyze the existing situation regarding the assessment and collection of
the Land Rent and Service Charge (LR & SC) and (b) to propose specific
measures that would increase its effectiveness, yield and equity. It
will also review other local taxes associated with LR & SC.
2.        More specifically, the study will deal with the following
topics:
(a)  Existing LR & SC system
(i) assessment - review of present valuation procedures
and program of valuation; estimate of time required
to complete this program with existing resources;
estimate of funds and manpower needed to complete
the revaluation program in the next two years;
(ii) collection - review of linkages between assessment
and collection agencies, between Ardhi's Directorate
of Land Development and the Commissioner of Internal
Revenues, and, on the local level, between the District
Land Officer (DLO) and the Internal Revenue Officer
(IRO); review of recording and payment notification
procedures; review of enforcement mechanisms; and
(iii) performance - review of the effectiveness of Central-
local, assessment-collection linkages, analysis of
present arrears; estimate of the shortfall of public
revenues due to the deficiencies in assessment,
collection, enforcement and lack of coordination
between those three components of the system;
identification of major bottlenecks affecting the
effectiveness of the system.
(b) Improvement measures
(i) analysis of the broad rationale of the present valuation
system based on the estimated market value of the land;
review of possible modification of this rationale in
order to introduce the level of services provided and,



ANNEX 7
Attachment 1
Page 2
cost of their maintenance as factors in setting up
the amount of LR & SC:  discussion of ways and means
of equalizing the charges among inhabitants of urban
areas; detailed outline of proposed modifications and
reforms of the present system in line with considerations
discussed above: necessary institutional adjustments and
incremental manpower and costs of the improved system;
estimates of potential revenues to be collected under the
new system; and
(ii)  analysis of advantages and feasibility of decentralizing
the responsibility for collection to the local author-
ities; analysis of feasibility of establishing a monthly
collection system; of linking the collection of LR & SC
with collection of utility charges; a detailed outline
of other modifications necessary to improve the collec-
tion-enforcement component; estimate of institutional
adjustments required (between central ministries and
local authorities, and between functional managers),
and of the incremental manpower and costs of the improved
component.
(c) Other local taxes associated with LR & SC - review of other
local taxes (registration fees, user charges for municipal
facilities such as markets and slaughter houses) estimate
of their yield and required collection system; analysis of
feasibility (social, economic and administrative) of improve-
ment of the present valuation collection system of those taxes.
3.        The final outcome of the study will be a detailed outline of an
improved LR & SC system, including specific recommendations and implementation
schedule as well as an analysis of costs and benefits of the proposed system.
4.        The responsibility for the study will be shared by Ardhi and
Treasury. A steering committee will be established comprising concerned
senior officials of both ministries. In addition to guidance and supervision,
the steering committee will ensure the coordination between the proposed study
and other efforts to improve local administration. The study will be carried
by a team comprising three full-time staff internationally recruited, special-
ist in land taxation, local public finance and local administration. Two
counterparts, one from Ardhi, one from Treasury will be designated to assist
the team and liaise with relevant authorities. Ardhi and Treasury will share
the responsibility of the logistics support for the team. The appropriate
duration will be six months:



ANNEX 7
Attachment 1
Page 3
-    one month to prepare a detailed brief
-    two months for the analysis of the existing situation
-    three months for formulation of modification and
reform proposals
5.        It is expected that the implementation of study recommendation as
approved by the steering committee and other relevant authorities will con-
stitute an integral part of the Second National Sites and Services project.
IDA will finance 18 man-months of consultant services (T Sh 747,000 or
US$90,000) to carry out the study.

TANZANIA
SECOND NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
Squatter Upgrading and Surveyed Plot Program
1.        The squatter upgrading and surveyed plot programs in Dar es Salaam
and the four upcountry towns will substantially improve the quality of urban
services provided to low-income households in the areas affected. In response
it is expected that the rate and quality of new housebuilding will increase,
while existing housing will be improved more rapidly. The provision of
materials loans by the Tanzania Kousing Bank for both new building and house
improvements will enhance the stimulus provided by the new services and
facilities.
2.        In evaluating the project the social costs of infrastructure,
housebuilding and recurrent expenditures were estimated using shadow prices
derived from an analysis of the composition of input costs and expenditures
in the Tanzanian economy.  Benefits generated by the project are measured by
the additional rents paid by households for existing and new housing improved
or built in response to the project.  Rent payments, however, provide only a
partial indication of the project's economic rate of return.  The improvement
in urban services provided in squatter areas and the construction of various
community facilities should also generate indirect benefits in the form of
better health, lower infant mortality, and better education for more children
which are not necessarily reflected in higher rental values. It was not
possible to quantify these indirect benefits because of the lack of adequate
data on levels of health, education and related variables in improved and
unimproved squatter areas. Therefore they (and the associated costs) were
not considered. Nonetheless, it is generally assumed that the benefits
derived from basic health and education facilities in low-income areas will
at least equal the cost of their provision.
A. Project Benefits
3.        Benefits generated by the project are measured by the increase in
total rent payments--either actual or imputed--for housing in the project
areas. Total rents may increase because new houses are built, existing ones
improved, or higher rents are being paid for the same accommodation reflecting
the improvement in services. It is assumed that as a result of the project,
more new houses will be built and more existing houses improved than would
have been the case without the project. To estimate the magnitude of increased
rental values alternative projections for the rates of housebuilding, housing
improvements and rent differentials were made for each project area to compare
the with and without project pattern of these variables.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
4.        On the basis of evidence gathered by Ardhi, the following assump-
tions were made regarding housebuilding and improvement in project areas. 1/
(a) In improved squatter areas new housebuilding will increase
the housing stock by 8% p.a. in Dar es Salaam and 10% p.a.,
in upcountry towns as compared with 5% p.a. in unimproved areas.
This housebuilding activity is subject to a limit on the overall
density of housing in a given area. A maximum feasible housing
stock was estimated for project sites. Furthermore, the composi-
tion of the new housing stock will differ: the proportion of
higher quality houses will be higher in improved than in the
unimproved areas (70% vs 40%). The rate of improvement of exist-
ing houses in improved areas will be twice that of unimproved
areas. The assumed values for the rate of improvement, rate and
composition of new building, as well as maximum housing stocks
for combined projects areas in each town are shown in Table 1.
It was assumed that construction periods for house improvement
and new housebuilding are one and two years respectively.
(b) For the surveyed plot areas a growth rate of 10% p.a. (subject
to overall density limit) was used since expansion and infilling
may be expected to take place more rapidly in new areas of devel-
opment with an organized layout. The composition of the new
housebuilding in these areas is shown in Table 1. It was assumed
that the houses are built in two years following the year of survey
and allocation of plots and that the survey program is phased
gradually over four years, as follows:
Year 1 - 10% of plots
Year 2 - 20% of plots
Year 3 - 30% of plots
Year 4 - 40% of plots
It was also assumed that the infrastructure ensuring a level
of services similar to that of improved squatter areas will
be provided in years 9 and 10 of the project. As beneficiaries
of the program will anticipate this provision, it was assumed
that it would not affect the rate and composition of house-
building but only the rent levels.
(c) Rents in Tanzania, subject to strict governmental controls, have
been practically frozen since 1972 while the general price level
has increased by over 60% during the same period. This situation
has resulted in a distortion of the rental market, under-the-
table or in-kind payments for living accommodations, and a sharp
reduction in the rate of housebuilding. If the housebuilding
1/   Some of the evidence used is discussed in Annex 1.

and improvement are to be encouraged, the rents must rise to
a level that would assure an adequate return on investment.
For the purpose of the analysis, rents were estimated by ad-
justing 1972 rents (last year before rent controls) to mid-1976
price level. Differentials between different categories of
houses and between unimproved and improved areas were based on
survey evidence on variations in rents in function of location
and level of services. The annual rents for a typical five-
room house that were used in the evaluation are shown in Table
1.
B. Costs
5.        All costs are expressed in mid-1976 prices.  Infrastructure
costs include physical contingencies, location allowance, detailed engineer-
ing and supervision and are net of taxes and duties. Infrastructure costs
for surveyed plots (other than initial provision of water kiosks) were esti-
mated using per hectare cost of squatter improvement for particular town
(see Annex 6, Table 4). Annual maintenance cost for infrastructure was taken
at 2% of capital costs. The administrative costs of implementing and adminis-
tering the project--Ardhi and THB personnel, surveying, title preparation--
were also included. The marginal costs of water consumption induced by the
project was estimated to be T Sh 50 per house per year.
6.        For the purpose of the analysis, housing stock was divided into
three categories, reflecting major quality differences. Table 1 shows
capital costs of building a house in each category as well as costs of im-
provements, i.e. the cost of upgrading a house from lower to higher category.
7.        Shadow prices for major items of project expenditure were estimated
by analyzing the cost of each item in terms of direct or indirect expenditures
on a limited number of key primary factors. The most important of these
were:
(a)  traded goods;
(b)  taxes and government revenue;
(c)  labor, which was divided into two categories--skilled
and unskilled; and
(d)  non-traded goods, including basic foodstuffs.
Accounting ratios, i.e., the ratios of shadow prices to market prices, were
estimated for each of these primary factors by examining their opportunity
cost to the Tanzanian economy. Working back from these accounting ratios
it was then possible to estimate the full range of shadow prices for major
expenditures items.

C. Project Evaluation
8.        Internal Rate of Return.  Using the above assumptions, the internal
rate of return for squatter upgrading and surveyed plots programs in each
project town range from 19.4% to 27.8% with an overall rate of return for
the project's shelter component of 22.9%. Detailed results of the analysis
are shown in Table 3-10.
9.        Sensitivity Analysis.  A number of parameters used in the evalua-
tion were estimated on the basis of limited evidence. The effect of variation
in values taken by these parameters was therefore investigated. The results
of this sensitivity analysis are shown in Table 2 for the five most important
cases investigated. The internal rate of return appears relatively insensi-
tive to changes in assumptions.

TANZANIA
SECOND NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
Monitoring and Evaluation
Background
1.        In  the first urban project the monitoring unit produced three
kinds of reports: reviews of on-site progress, based on personal interviews
with contractors, consultants, and local officials; occasional papers on a
particular problem, such as the difficulty of issuing occupancy licenses
to squatters; and one general socioeconomic survey of a community to be
upgraded. While helpful, these studies were frequently ad hoc, with the
unit too small to carry on systematic recordkeeping of key indicators that
project management needed to know for each site. Furthermore, it remained
unclear whether the unit was to serve primarily as an outside evaluator of
the project, reporting directly to the Principal Secretary, or more as
project management support, providing information regularly to the Sites
and Services division.
Proposed Program
2.        For the second project, the function and content of the monitoring
has been modified to overcome the difficulties encountered in the first
project. As outlined in the report (para 5.05), monitoring will be one of
the responsibilities of the management support unit, located directly under
the head of the Sites and Services Division (see Figure 4, Annex 5). For
this particular project, there is greater need for monitoring to be of
direct service to project management rather than to remain as an outside
evaluator of the project.
3.        Within the Management Section, two staff members will be assigned
full time to the monitoring unit: one researcher with a background in social
sciences and an assistant with some field work experience. Efforts will be
made to find Tanzanian nationals for both positions, but funds have been
provided to hire an expatriate researcher, if necessary. Other members of
the section will also provide assistance. Overall, the monitoring will
involve two tasks:
4.        First, the unit will be responsible for the up-to-date maintenance
of a basic management information system. Forms to facilitate the collec-
tion of this data will be prepared by the unit, filled out by the regional
administrators responsible for execution in the field and then collected
and analyzed by the unit on a regular basis. Information will be collected
on the following topics:
(a) known socioeconomic characteristics of the community
to be upgraded and the applicants for surveyed plots;



ANNEX 10
Page   2
(b) number of applications received for surveyed plot
program, number actually allotted plots, and charac-
teristics of accepted and restricted applicants;
(c) existing level and quality of infrastructure and
utilities in areas to be upgraded;
(d) pace of construction of the project infrastructure;
(e) pace of housing consolidation or improvement to be
done on an annual basis;
(f) degree of participation in the housing loan program
and repayment record;
(g) collection of Land Rent and Service Charge;
(h) inventory of small-scale industries and their problems;
and
(i) use of community facilities.
5.        To the extent suitable, the recording of this data should follow
the format suggested in the Bank's "Manual for Information and Monitoring
Data in Urban Projects." Prior to the implementation of this record system,
the monitoring staff will assist in conducting a management training seminar
for local administrators from the regions during which the system will be
fully explained.
6.        Secondly, the monitoring unit will, from time to time, do special
surveys to research particular problems in greater depth. Possible topics
include: the functioning of particular community facilities, 1/ the success
of community orientation for the project, current house construction costs,
and the experiences of households displaced by the upgrading process. A
budget of T Sh 300,000 is included for hiring temporary researchers and
interviewers to collect the data, purchase supplies and hire temporary
office help.
7.        The monitoring unit will be responsible for compiling quarterly
reports which include, inter alia, the results of the unit's surveys and
research. The quarterly reports will be submitted to IDA. A final respon-
sibility of the monitoring unit will be the preparation of a Project Comple-
tion Report for submission to Government and IDA within three months of the
last disbursement, i.e. by March 31, 1982.
1/   Monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of the nutrition-cum-
health services offered under the MCH component is to be carried out
by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with UNICEF.
