Borrower:         The Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Beneficiaries:    The provinces of Sind, North West Frontier and
Baluchistan
Amount:           SDR 53.0 million (US$ 52.50 million equivalent)
Terms:            Standard
On lending terms: The proceeds of the Credit will be lent by the
Borrower to the provinces on standard IDA terms.
Project
Description:      The main objective of the project is to improve the
quality of primary education in Pakistan; it would
cover about 14,000 schools in the Sind, Baluchistan and
Northwest Frontier provinces. Quality improvement would be
achieved by more effective in-service training and
supervision of teachers, improved learning materials, the
expanded use of assistant teachers, improved physical
facilities, and greater community support.
Risks             The success of the project will depend mainly on whether
teachers can be influenced sufficiently to improve the
quality of teaching. The project would adopt a new
approach to teacher training through the development of
integrated learning modules for teacher training and
classroom use. The development of well designed learning
modules therefore would be crucial to the success of the
project. The risk inherent in this innovation would be
minimized by the recruitment and training of staff and the
use of experienced foreign expertise to advise them.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
SECOND PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
I. PRIMARY EDUCATION IN PAKISTAN
A. Introduction
1.01    Pakistan has made impressive progress over the Fifth Plan period
(1979-83) in expanding its industrial base and agricultural production.
Progress has been helped by an increase in the availability of water and by
prudently managed public finances. But improved economic performance has not
been matched by similar achievements in controlling population growth or
increasing literacy levels. The growth in primary school enrollments during
the Fifth Plan barely kept pace with population growth, which remains at
about 3Z p.a., resulting in a nearly static adult literacy level of 22Z.
Inequities in educational opportunities for girls compared to boys and in
rural compared to urban areas have been accentuated rather than diminsihed
during the same period. As a result, Pakistan is faced with the urgent need
to strengthen its neglected social base not only to achieve a more equitable
distribution of the benefits of economic growth but also to lay the fonda-
tions for sustained economic growth over the long run.
1.02    The variety of terrain in the country as well as the diverse ethnic
origins have also created imbalances in development especially in the social
sectors. The most fertile locations (mainly in the Punjab) are also the most
heavily populated, while vast semi-desert areas (mainly in Sind and Baluchis-
tan) remain sparsely populated and support only a nomadic lifestyle. Because
of the dispersed population in some provinces it is difficult and expensive
to develop education and health services.
B. Issues in Primary Education
1.03    Education Planning and Management.  Successive national five-year
Plans have failed to achieve primary education targets. Although each Plan
recognized the importance of establishing an adequate base for the educa-
tional system, the results so far have been disappointing. The decrease in
primary level enrollment ratios throughout the nation during the Fifth Plan
period, was attributed to inadequate expenditures and the absence of a
suitable machinery for the planning, implementation and supervision of
primary education development programs.
1.04    While planning for the development of the education sector and the
allocation of development budgets through Annual Development Plans (ADPs)



-2-
remain a federal responsibility, primary education is a provincial respon-
sibility. Five-year education development plans have not been well imple-
mented because of this division of responsibility, and because the provinces
enjoy considerable autonomy in establishing their own planning priorities.
Plans to increase enrollments and literacy levels tend to be interpreted at
the provincial level to mean the opening of new schools and employing more
teachers. However, if the quality of teaching is low, more schools and more
teachers would not significantly improve literacy levels, especially in rural
areas. Therefore, such investments are largely wasted. Furthermore, reliable
information is not available on enrollments, facilities, and unit costs. The
system of collecting, processing, and reporting educational statistics does
not provide the information necessary for planning and budgeting at either
provincial or federal levels.
1.05    Recurrent Costs.  While development expenditures are financed mainly
through the Annual Development Plans (ADPs), recurrent costs in the education
sector must be met from limited provincial revenues. For this reason, the
education sector in the Provinces has not expanded as rapidly as other sec-
tors even when the Federal Covernment has made education a priority area for
development. Another factor compounding the recurrent cost burden is the
variation of population densities in the country. While the national stu-
dent-teacher ratio is about 40:1, it varies widely by district and Province.
In some areas, schools have fewer than 15 enroLlees per teacher while in
others the ratio is closer to 70:1. The necessity of providing equal access
to education particularly in low density areas increases the recurrent cost
burden.
1.06    Community Attitudes.  Community support and parental interest in
education are major determinants of schooL enrollment. Children, especially
girls, are kept out of school because of a lack of awareness of the potential
benefits and also because of socio-religious beliefs and customs. The oppor-
tunity cost of school attendance also discourages poor families from enroll-
ing their children. Moreover, those children who do attend school for only a
few years often remain illiterate, thereby supporting the view that education
has little to offer to poor families.
1.07    Quality.  Few rural children who attend primary school acquire basic
literacy and numeracy and about 50% drop out before grade V. Most of those
who reach Grade IV are unable to answer even simple questions drawn from the
science and mathematics syllabus. The main reasons for these low achievement
levels are poorly trained teachers, the lack of instructional materials,
inadequate supervision and decaying physical facilities. Pre-service and
in-se=vice teacher training programs are weak and ineffective in imparting
classroom teaching skills and upgrading subject matter competence. Teachers
are also unsupervised. The small cadre of sub-district officials responsible
for supervision can manage only one to two inspections per school per year.
This is insufticient to monitor the teachers' performance or provide remedial
guidance. Adequate instructional materials for teachers and students are
generally are not available in rural areas. Furthermore, most of what is
available is not organized into lessons or other classroom activities, and is
therefore not used as intended.  School bu'ilings are poorly designed and
badly constructed. The lack of technical and professional skills at union
council level has produced structures that are unsuitable and costly to



-3-
maintain. In the absence of maintenance, many buildings have fallen into a
state of decay and disrepair.
C. Government Education Programs and Policies
1.08    Compared with other developing countries, Pakistan has allocated a
very low percentage of its CDP of public sector outlays to education. The
consequences are clearly manifested in low levels of literacy and the poor
quality of education at all levels. Recognizing this the Sixth Plan
(FY84-88) proposed a sharp change in sectoral priorities and a considerable
increase in development spending on education. The Sixth Plan strategy
emphasized: (i) primary and secondary education; (ii) the launching of a mass
literacy program; (iii) lower spending on higher education combined with
attempts to improve quality; and (iv) increasing the enrollment of girls and
education facilities in rural areas.  With respect to development spending,
the Sixth Plan called for an increase of 2002 over the level achieved during
the Fifth Plan, which would raise the share of education from 4.6% to 8.3Z of
total ADP outlays.
1.09    The Sixth Plan set ambitious targets for primary education.  These
included 902 enrollment of boys and 60Z enrollment of girls, for a national
average enrollment ratio of 75% of the primary school age group by the end
of the Plan period. Five years of education would be made obligatory. The
additional enrollment in Grades I through V were expected to be about 5.6
million representing an increase of more than 81% over present enrollments.
To accommodate this large increase, 40,000 new mosque schools were to be
opened under the Special Development Program for Primary Education and 24,000
primary schools were to be improved. The Plan proposed to meet this objec-
tive by using the mosques to accommodate Grades I to III and constructing
buildings for existing sheterless schools, new schools to house Grades IV and
V, and sheds to supplement the space for schools opened in mosques. Mixed
enrollments would be introduced in Grades I to III but separate girls'
schools would be maintained where essential. Two teachers (including the
Imam) would be provided in each mosque school, and pne teacher for each Grade
in the Grades IV and V schools. Finally, separate agencies for the implemen-
tation of primary education programs would be created at the Federal, Provin-
cial and local levels.
1.10    The Plan also proposed to address issues of poor quality and dropout
through changes in the curriculum since it is considered too demanding in
the early grades. In Crades I-IrI, only religious instruction, reading,
writing, and arithmetic would be taught, while science and social studies
would be integrated into reading and writing. The full curriculum would only
be taught in Grades IV and V. The role of communities and local bodies would
be expanded to help improve quality, motivate teachers, upgrade school
facilities and determine school hours and vacation periods to help meet local
requirements. In order to implement these programs the Plan proposed an
allocation of Rs 7 billion of which 50X would be earmarked for the Special
Development Program for Primary Education. The remaining Rs 3.5 billion
would be used by the Provinces to implement their ongoing programs in primary
education.
1.11    The first two years of the Plan were marked by a serious underfunding
of the education sector which received only 23Z of the proposed five-year



-4-
allocation. Allocations to primary education amounted to only 18% compared
to the Plan target of 34Z. The lower share of primary education was the
result of discontinuing the Special Development Program and of underfunding
of primary education programs by the Provinces themselves. Other subsectors
which received smaller than projected shares were technical education and
mass literacy, while university and college education, helped by political
influences, received relatively larger allocations. The Three-Year Priority
Investment Program has been introduced in an attempt to reorient development
expenditures towards the original Sixth Plan strategy and objectives and to
rectify shortfalls in the social sectors by greatly expanding outlays in
education. The Program allocates Rs 9.7 billion to education of which 28%
would be for primary education, 25Z for secondary education, and 9% for
technical education, while allocations to university education would be
significantly reduced from 17Z in FY83-85 to 12Z under the Program.
1.12    The proposed reorientation of sectoral allocations if it can be
achieved would mean that spending on primary education would reach 50% of the
level originally called for in the Sixth Plan. Primary school enrollments
would rise by 2.1 million compared to the Plan target of 5.6 million, leading
to a primary school participation rate of 53% by the end of the Plan period
compared to a target of 75%. Since higher education has strong political
support, attaining this shift will require external support and a strong
Government commitment. Increased allocations to the primary sector will
depend almost entirely on the successful and timely implementation of the
proposed project and on the implementation of an additional primary education
project for the Punjab and Federally administered territories during FY86.
These two projects alone wouLd account for 40X of the primary education
allocation under the Priority Program and would be solely responsible for the
projected rise in the primary education share of the budget from the present
18% to 28Z.
D. External Financing of Education
1.13    Few donors have been involved in financing primary educatica in
recent years. The UNDP has budgeted US$3 million for the education sector
for the period 1978-84. Activities include assistance to educational
administration in the provinces, assistance to the Open University, the
National Institute of Psychology, the Academy for Education Planning and
Management, the Scientific Instrument Center and some support for skill
development and women's training. USAID is not significantly involved in
the education sector but is currently reappraising its priorities. ADB will
support secondary science education and is currently preparing a project
which would include the provision of equipment including the development of
science kits, strengthening science teacher training, and the establishment
of an Institute for the Promotion of Science Education. UNICEF has supported
primary education through its integrated services program in nine districts
of the Punjab, five in NWFP, one in Sind and selected population clusters in
Baluchistan.
E. The Bank's Role in the Education Sector
1.14    The Bank has supported the development of the sector with five
projects covering a broad front. An on-going primary education project
(Credit 892-PAK) supports basic needs at the primary level so as to raise



-5-
the general level of literacy and numeracy as well as to expand the educa-
tional base within all provinces. IDA has supported skilled manpower
development for the agriculture sector through university training programs
and agricultural extension training under Credit 678-PAK. Primary teacher
training was also supported under Credit 678-PAK. Skilled and semi-skilled
manpower development for the industrial sector is being supported by Credit
1109-PAK. IDA will expand its intervention in basic education by addressing
the adult literacy issue in a non-formal project which is under preparation.
A project in rural skills training is also being prepared which will aim to
improve self-employment for both men and women in rural areas. At the secon-
dary level, the need to improve science education to create an adequate base
of well educated graduates for entry to higher education is apparent. A
possible science education project which will complement the proposed ADB
project is under consideration.
1.15    Project implementation has been improving in the education sector.
To date three projects have been completed. The First Education Project (Cr.
50-PAK) which financed the expansion of Lyallpur (Faisalabad) Agricultural
University and equipment for six polytechnics was completed about eight years
behind schedule. The main causes of delay included two wars, floods,
shortages of materials, and sharp price increases which affected the pace of
work. Other factors which affected implementation were cumbersome implemen-
tation procedures, the unfamiliarity of project staff with IDA procedures,
and the late appointment of consulting architects. The Second Education
Project (Cr. 206-PAK) which assisted the NED Government Engineering College
in Karachi was completed three and a half years behind schedule and suffered
to a lesser extent from similar problems. The main cause of delay was the
Government of Sind's reluctance to use Credit funds for foreign experts and
fellowships. The Third Education Project (Credit 678-PAK) was completed in
June 1984, two years behind schedule. Delays were due to difficulties in
obtaining building sites and the lack of adequate technical assistance
because of the Government's reluctance to use Credit funds for this purpose.
The Fourth Education Project (Cr. 892-PAK) is expected to be completed on
schedule although it will be under spent, which is due mainly to changes in
the Rupee exchange rate. It has been a successful experimental project,
yielding important results which have guided the design of the proposed
project (e.g. the supervision system, the assistant teacher concept and
evaluation were the main successes; teacher training, communications and
dissemination of achievements were less successful, school building construc-
tion methods were unsatisfactory). Project Completion Reports and Audit
Reports for Credits 50-PAK and 206-PAK have been completed and issued.  The
PCR for Credit 678-PAK is under preparation.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin
2.01    The proposed project is an outcome of the first primary education
project, Credit 892-PAK, which was carried out as an experiment to provide a
better understanding of subsectoral issues and to identify possible solutions
to these issues. As a result of the experience and findings from this
project, the proposed project has been designed on a larger scale but would
still retain an emphasis on research and experimentation. The project has
been designed as an integral part of the governmRnt's Sixth Plan.  As such it



-6-
sets out to help achieve some of the Sixth Plan objectives for primary educa-
tion.
B. Project Objectives
2.02    The objectives of the proposed project are to improve quality and
find an effective strategy for raising literacy and student achievement. The
major objectives of the project would be to:
(a) Improve teacher effectiveness through the provision of (i) instruc-
tional guides and training materials that organize the curriculum
into a set of tightly structured lessons, (ii) in-service training
courses in the effective use and further elaboration of these
materials, and (iii) continuing training and support through
on-the-job supervision and guidance.
(b) develop low-cost primary education through (i) the use of assistant
teachers; (ii) the development of low-cost, low-maintenance school
buildings; (iii) increasing average student-teacher ratios; and (iv)
developing national policies which encourage low-cost primary school-
ing.
C. Project Strategy and Scope
2.03    Given the problems of primary education in Pakistan (paras 1.03 -
1.07), the low expectations of teachers, parents, and the educational
authorities in rural areas become powerful, self-fulfilling prophecies. These
attitudes eventually undermine all programs of constructive reform. A change
in the perception of the role of the village school, and the social contribu-
tion it can make, is necessary towards meeting naticnal development objec-
tives. The proposed project would attack this problem frontally. Instead of
the conventional approach to educational programuing where the problems
associated with teachers, buildings, management, materials and curriculum are
addressed in separate projects, the proposed project would adopt an
integrated, school-based strategy in which all input components would be
upgraded concurrently. The project would attempt to demonstrate that quality
primary education can be provided at a lower unit cost, and on a larger scale
than previously considered possible. If successful, it will stimulate loca'
commitment and support which has been lacking in the past, but which is
indispensable to the effective evolution and growth of primary education.
Since the evaluation of the first project was sufficiently conclusive to
justify the design of a larger scale project, the proposed project would
cover nearly 14,000 schools in Sind, North West Frontier and Baluchistan.1/
The project would: (a) upgrade educational quality in about 59Z of the
schools, (b) influence the teaching methods of approximat.Ay 54Z of the
teachers, and (c) improve the achievement of approximately 44Z of the ptimary
school children in these provinces.
1/ At the time of appraisal, Punjab had declined to be included in the
project. The ProvinciaL authorities have subsequently requested a second
project and this is currently under preparation.



-7-
D. Project Inputs
2.04    Several input components of the first primary education project which
proved successful would be retained and expanded, and those that failed would
be either modified or dropped and others added. However, there would be two
major changes in implementation which would make the proposed project
qualitatively and quantitatively different from the first project and
increase its potential impact. First, input components would not be dis-
persed over scattered school sites, but concentrated on entire districts.
Second, the responsibility for the inputs and their effective use would be
substantially transferred from special project units to the regular manage-
ment structure of the Provincial Education Departments. In the districts
that participate, the project would no longer operate solely as an experimen-
tal and therefore a temporary adjunct to the regular system. It would con-
stitute the regular system, the only system, of primary education in effect
at these locations. The project would have eight distinct but mutually rein-
forcing inputs which are as follows:
2.05    Supervision.  The hypothesis that by expanding the cadre of School
Learning Coordinators (SLC) the frequency of school visits would increase
and would reduce teacher absenteeism, increase professional guidance to
teachers, and stimulate greater coimmunity support was confirmed in Credit
892-PAK. Under the proposed project the use of SLCs would be expanded and a
number of additional staff essential to meet the management demands of this
expanded cadre v-uld be established at district and sub-district levels. The
project would fisance vehicles, and the salaries and allowances of an addi-
tional 679 SLCs and 79 management staff on a declining scale (Annex 2, Table
I).
2.06    Assistant Teachers.  The hypothesis that the employment of uncer-
tified (assistant) teachers especially females can be educationally sound as
well as a low-cost solution to the shortage of teachers in rural areas, was
also confirmed under Credit 892-PAK. Since assistant teachers assumed
responsibilities and demonstrated teaching capabilities equal to those of the
regular teachers, the project would support about 2350 additional Assistant
Teachers by financing their salaries on a declining basis (Annex 2, Table
1).
2.07    In-service Training.  The in-service training program developed in
Credit 892-PAK identified the nature and extent of skill deficiencies in
teachers but did little to overcome them. The content of the courses was
inappropriate, the isolation of the training from the other project inputs
and the absence of follow-up and assistance in applying the lessons in the
classroom were the major reasons for the poor results. Accordingly, the
proposed project would restructure the in-service training program.
In-service training would be linked to the development and use of tightly
structured learning modules (para 2.08) and continuous follow-up would be
provided by the SLCs. The project would support in-service training by
financing training allowances and consumable training materials for about
2,500 supervisors and SLCs, 2,350 assistant teachers and nearly 30,000



-8-
regular teachers (Annex 2, Table 2).  During negotiations agreement was
reached with the government 1/ on a comprehensive staff training plan.
2.08   Learning Materials.  Primary school teachers were found to be defi-
cient in subject-matter knowledge as well as teaching techniques. Under
Credit 892-PAK, only limited provision was made for developing and distribut-
ing instructional guides. In the proposed project, this situation would be
remedied by expanding the provision of learning materials. Subjects taught
at each grade level would be analysed to identify the specific skills stu-
dents are expected to learn, and a self-contained learning module consisting
of demonstration exercises for the teacher, practice exercises for the stu-
dents, and a mastery test, would be developed for each skill. The modules
would serve as the basis for in-service teacher training, as teacher's guides
and as focal points for on-the-job training by the SLCs. The project would
finance the preparation, testing, publication and printing of at least 276
modules for the main subjects for each Grade. During negotiations the
government provided assurances that: (a) the specifications and prototypes
of the learning modules would be developed in a manner satisfactory to IDA;
(b) they would be developed, in consultation with the Provinces, in accord-
ance with guidelines, a work program and a schedule satisfactory to IDA; (c)
a detailed schedule and syllabus of in-service courses would be prepared and
furnished to IDA for approval; and (d) the modules would be used imediately
after development and thereafter for such in-service courses. The furnishing
of the detailed schedule and syllabus of in-service courses for IDA approval
would be an additional condition of credit effectiveness.
2.09    Physical Facilities.  Most of the classrooms, constructed under the
previous project, were used as one-room schools at sites where there was no
school building previously; this tended to exacerbate the problem of
single-teacher schools. Because of the absence of local construction
capabilities in isolated locations and the inability of the C&W Department
to supervise thousands of scattered school sites, most classrooms were of
low quality, inferior design, costly, and increased the maintenance
liability. In the proposed project, construction would be limited to the
expansion of schools that have adequate enrollments and teaching staff. It
is also planned that low-cost, low maintenance classrooms would be either
constructed in a large number by a large contractor or manufactured, shipped,
and assembled at each site on a turnkey contract basis. It is expected
thereby to overcome local construction deficiencies identified in the first
project. To the extent possible local communities would be encouraged to
erect boundary walls and to rehabilitate existing classrooms. A total of
6,000 new classrooms, 4,000 boundary walls and the rehabilitation of about
12,000 existing classrooms would be financed under the project. During
negotiations, the government provided assurances that guidelines (Annex 4)
acceptable to IDA would be followed for the selection of schools for school
building improvement (para 3.04).
1/ Throughout this document 'the government' means the Government of Pakis-
tan acting on behalf of the Federal Government and participating Provin-
cial Governments.



-9-
2.10    Communication and Dissemination.  Information about the findings of
the first project has had limited circulation in Pakistan and the educational
community. In order to publicize these accomplishments and the new oppor-
tunities being created in the proposed project, an active dissemination
program including the use of broadcast media would be undertaken. This would
also be a means of building support for primary education in the community.
The project would finance on a declining scale, the salaries of the addi-
tional staff required for this purpose including one information officer in
the Federal Coordinating Unit (FCU) and three professional assistants one in
each Provincial Implementatin Unit (PIU). The project would also finance 36
staff-months of contract services to assist in the development of media and
related materials.
2.11   Information Systems.  Obtaining accurate data on enrollments,
drop-outs and costs proved to be extremely difficult in the past. In order
to maximize the effectiveness of the proposed project, access to reliable
data would be essential. Rather than rely on special studies or surveys to
assemble such data, the approach would be to upgrade the,regular information
flow in the participating districts by installing more efficient and reliable
procedures. To achieve this objective the project would support the
strengthening of management information systems by financing on a declining
scale the cost of additional staff (Annex 5) and equipment.
2.12    Project Evaluation.  Three kinds of evaluative studies would be
undertaken. The first would be assessments of the extent to which the inter-
mediate outcomes (e.g., improvements in the teachers' classroom performance,
more positive attitudes toward education on the part of the local comr
munities) are being achieved. These assessments would be carried out through
surveys conducted jointly by teams of the Federal Coordination Unit (FCU) and
Provincial Implementation Units (PIUs). The results would indicate whether or
not the inputs designed to produce these outcomes are effective or need to be
strengthened. The second would be assessments of the achievement of the
project's ultimate objectives - increased participation, greater student
achievement, lower per capita costs. These would be based on the detailed
(improved) records that would be maintained at each site and forwarded to the
district and provincial levels as part of the regular information flow. The
results would indicate whether the intermediate outcomes that are being
achieved are sufficient to produce the intended long-term effects, or whether
there are other significant sub-sector issues that also must be addressed.
The third, which would be triggered by shortfalls in either of the others,
would be diagnostic and formative studies to identify the aspects that must
be strengthened or added. These would be carried out by FCU or PIU staff, or
by other agencies under contract to the FCU. Problems that cannot be ade-
quately explored with formative studies would be addressed by special
research studies, as elaborated below. The pattern of implementation by
tranches 1/ that would be followed would accelerate the normally slow pace at
which the findings of evaluative studies are applied to project operation.
As new insights are developed, they would be applied by the PIUs in the
preparation of the proposals for the next tranche, and by the FCU in the

implications in the contect of this project.



-10-
appraisal of these proposals. Evaluation units established under Credit
892-PAK will be strengthened under the proposed project which will finance
new staff positions (para 2.13).
2.13    Project Studies.  (a) Research Studies would be carried out to enable
detailed diagnostic assessments to be undertaken on topics of relevancE! to
the development of primary education, and according to needs that a,-_;e
during implementation; these would be of value in the preparation of future
plans for primary education. (b) A teacher training study to enable a full
review of pre-service teacher training, identifying issues and proposed
solutions would be commissioned. (c) Project preparation studies to permit
preparatory work to be undertaken for future education and training projects
would also be started. (d) A completion study of the proposed project would
be financed. Eleven additional staff positions would be created to expand
the existing PIU teams (Annex 5 shows the total staff required) so that they
can undertake evaluation of the project and these studies. The project would
finance vehicles, and salaries, allowances and other operating costs on a
declining basis.
E. Technical Assistance
2.14    The project would finance 225 staff-months of specialist services
(Annex 6). Sixty staff-months would be used for the continued employment of
a long term foreign adviser, throughout the duration of the project.
Short-term consultancies would be needed: (a) early in the implementation
period for assistance on learning modules probably from abroad (30-40
staff-months); (b) throughout the whole project on information systems
(60 staff-months); and (c) on educational measurements (24-29 staff-months).
To assist with the production of media materials for the dissemination of
information about primary education, a professional firm, which can provide
both the specialist knowledge and equipment, would be placed under contract
(36 staff months). During negotations, the government provided an assurance
that the terms of reference, qualifications, and conditions of employment of
all consultants be acceptable to IDA.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, FINANCING & COSTS
A. Project Management
3.01    A management structure was established under Credit 892-PAK consist-
ing of the FCU and PIUs in each province. These units are responsible for
general project management, civil works and equipment procurement, data
collection and processing, research and evaluation, accounting, record keep-
ing, and the preparation of reports. Though gaps remain in the staffing at
the federal level, in the three participating Provinces (Sind, NWFP and
Baluchistan) the PIU staff constitute a base on which further capacity can be
built and enable the proposed project to be implemented without delay. As a
condition of Credit effectiveness four project directors, one for the FCU and
one for each PIU would be appointed. During negotiations, the government
provided assurances that: (a) the FCU and PIUs, established under Credit
892-PAK, would be maintained and strengthened in a manner satisfactory to IDA
and; (b) to this end the Project Directors and other staff necessary for
carrying out the Project ir.cluding staff specified in Annex 5 would be
appointed in accordance with a schedule satisfactory to IDA.



-l1-
3.02    The management of the proposed project would differ from the first
project in three ways. First, the number of implementation staff would be
expanded. Additional staff positions in such fields as educational technol-
ogy, research, information systems, and communications and public relations
would be required (Annex 5).
3.03    Second, the proposed project would integrate project management into
the provincial administrative system. District Education Officers, for the
first time, would play a major role in implementation in Sind and NWFP, and
an expanded role in Baluchistan. In all provinces the PIUs would have closer
links with, or be incorporated into, the Department of Education.
3.04    Third, the mechanism for project implementation and phasing would
differ from the first project to afford greater flexibility and provide for
adaptive design changes during implementation. This flexibility would be
achieved by implementing the project in five tranches, only the first of
which has been designed. Subsequent tranches would be designed, according to
the agreed guidelines, within each project district of each province in a
phased sequence. These tranches would be submitted to the provincial offices
for clearance and comment. District staff would be involved in the design
but would be assisted by provincial technical staff. Clearances at provin-
cial level would be granted only if the designs conform to the established
guidelines which were agreed during appraisal (Annex 4). Thereafter the
design would be submitted to the FCU where a more formal appraisal of the
proposal would be carried out. This would entail field visits and discus-
sions. Final clearance by the Association would be required except as the
Association shall otherwise agree. During negotiations the government
provided assurances that: (a) implementation tranche proposals for each of
the participating provinces would be prepared in accordance with guidelines
acceptable to IDA; (b) no later than the three months from the effectiveness
date the government would furnish to IDA for review the second implementation
tranche proposal for the three participating provinces and; (c) it would
furnish to IDA for review the implementation tranche proposals for the third
through fifth tranches for each of the provinces in accordance with a
schedule acceptable to IDA.
3.05    The mechanism of tranche appraisal would eventually provide a new
institutional capability for handling future sub-sector loans. For this
purpose the FCU would gradually phase out of its present implementation
management role, and devolve this to the PIUs and the Departments of Educa-
tion. The FCU's responsibilities would then be primarily the appraisal of
tranche proposals and supervision of their implementation. In this way an
intermediary institution would be established at the federal level capable of
appraising provincial programs and financing priority investments. To ensure
that adequate financial resources are available for the implementation of the
project, 80% of project costs would be made available to the provinces in
addition to their normal ADP allocations. The remaining 20% would be
provided by the provinces from their own resources or from their normal ADP.



-12-
B.  Building Design and Construction
3.06    The first primary education project demonstrated that traditional
methods of planning, design and construction are unsatisfactory and inap-
propriate for a school building program of this scale. The inadequacies of
the C&W department to supervise the thousands of school sites and the lack of
local technical and professional skills led to costly and badly constructed
buildings that are unsuitable and a maintenance Liability.
3.07    To explore remedies to these problems identified in the previous
project, extensive discussions were held with the government and various
options were considered from the use of traditional construction to fully
factory-made classrooms. It was decided to procure 6,000 classroom through
ICB in packages of 1,000 cr more. Bid documents would be based on perfor-
mance specifications with at least two "deemed-to-satisfy" designs. Contrac-
tors would be permitted to bid using any one or more of the following con-
struction methods: (a) traditional on-site construction contractor;
(b) partially industrialized manufacture and site assembly combined with
on--site construction of some components; (c) fully industrialized manufacture
delivery and site assembly. Industrialized cLassroom units would have to be
designed for ease of transportation and site assembly and would have the
advantage of requiring less on-site supervision. On-site supervision and
maintenance would be taken into account in the evaluation of bids. The rate
of supply and delivery to sites would be phased in accordance with the
implementation tranches. It is anticipated that such a program would enable
classrooms to be procured at competitive rates.
3.08    Construction Management.  A well established national firm of plan-
ning and construction consultants (NESPAK) has been appointed to provide
services as a project Construction Manager (CM). The CM would be responsible
for the management of all civil works under the project including the
procurement of 6,000 classrooms. The CM will undertake scheduling and cost-
ing and develop strategies to harmonize with the overall needs and priorities
of the project. The CM would inter-alia make arrangements and be .esponsible
for: (a) pre-qualification of contractors; (b) the preparation of the
documentation for international competitive bidding (ICB) including perfor-
mance specifications and two "deemed-to-satisfy" designs (one for traditional
and one for semi-industrialized classrooms); these would be prepared by the
CM, if necessary with the assistance of an externally appointed consultant
(para 3.09); (c) the evaluation of submissions; (d) recommendations on the
award; (e) phasing; (f) logistic and legal considerations; (g) performance
testing and guarantees; and (h) site supervision. In addition the CM would
advise and coordinate the technical planning and costing of the local
individual works at each school site (boundary walls, classroom renovation
etc.,) and the coordination of building production overall. During nego-
tiations the government agreed that the prequalification of turnkey contrac-
tors, the preparation of bidding documents, including the performance
specifications and two deem-to-satisfy designs, would be substantially com-
plete and ready for tendering by June, 1985.
3.09    Production of Physical Facilities.  As a result of inviting bids from
the pre-qualified turnkey contractors, the CM would conduct an initial
evaluation first to establish that the buildings to be supplied substantially
meet the performance specificacions; the CM would then make recomaendations



-13-
for award on the basis of the lowest evaluated bid. An externally appointed
consultant, acceptable to IDA, would be appointed to assist with the evalua-
tion. The contractor would be responsible for the construction and or
manufacture, testing, transportation, erection and commissioning of the
classroom units, and providing the necessary warranties and bonds. The
manufacture, production, delivery and site erection by trained operatives
would be planned and managed by the contractor. The CM would be responsible
for assisting the FCU in monitoring the progress of the work and coordinating
building production and completion in accordance with the programmed needs of
the Provinces and for on-site supervision. This would include some locally
executed building renovations, boundary walls and other minor works. In
addition the CM would process all civil works certificates in accordance with
IDA procedures. Fees for the construction management and other professional
services have been included in the cost estimates.
C. Project Costs
3.10    Summaries of cost.  The total cost of the project including duties
and taxes on imported goods is estimated at about Rs 1168 million or
US$ 73.03 million equivalent. Detailed project costs by component, institu-
tion and time are given in Annex 7. The breakdown of local and foreign costs
for each component is summarized in Table 3.1.

3.12    Basis of Cost Estimates.  Estimated costs for new classrooms,
rehabilitation, and other local construction are based respectively on:
(a) specifications for the new classrooms at current international rates
including delivery and erection (Rs 55,000 per classroom); (b) a physical
survey 1/ of existing buildings and rehabilitation needs (averaging Rs 1250
per classroom); and (c) an average cost of boundary walls (Rs 8,000 per
school). Fees for construction management services reflect the current
scales of fees established for such services provided by local consultancy
firms. Schools that are eligible to receive new classrooms would also
qualify for classroom rehabilitation and boundary wall construction.
3.13    Estimated equipment costs are based upon costs of similar equipment
supplied by UNICEF in Pakistan. Furniture estimates reflect the results of
the physical survey of schools in each province. Consumable training
material costs were calculated on the basis of 9.0 rupees per student per
year. Other operating costs are based upon relevant operating costs in
similar circumstances in Pakistan and additional staff salaries plus allowan-
ces are based upon Public Service Commission scales.
3.14    Customs Duties and Taxes.  The cost of che project includes import
duties and taxes estimated at about US$ 7.51 million.
3.15    Contingency ALlowances.  Estimated project costs include physical
contingencies (US$ 5.33 million) estimated at 10Z of base costs. Price
contingencies (US$ 14.38 million) to cover expected price escalation were
calculated at the rates shown below. Foreign costs are calculated at 6.25%
in FY86, 7.75% in FY87, 8.0Z from FY88-90 and 6.5Z in FY91. Local costs at
6.5% in FY86 and FY87 and 6.0% from FY88-91.
3.16    Foreign Exchange Component.  The estimated foreign exchange component
of US$ 27.69 million representing 38% of estimated total project cost, has
been calculated on the basis of estimated foreign exchange proportions as
follows: (a) civil works (new construction and rehabilitation) 6Z; (b)
furniture 13%; (c) building components and equipment 70%; (d) vehicles 40Z;
(e) classroom equipment, learning modules and training materials 13%; (f)
fellowships 90%; (g) local training 8Z; (h) foreign experts 70%; and Ci)
operation and maintenance from 0% - 80% depending upon the category.
D. Project Financing
3.17    Financing Plan The total project cost of US$ 73.03 million equivalent
would be financed by a proposed IDA Credit uf US$ 52.50 million equivalent,
which would cover 80% of total project cost net of taxes. The Government
would finance the remaining net costs of US$ 13.02 million (20% of total net
project cost) and all taxes. The proposed financing plan for the project is
summarized in Table 3.3.

3.18    Retroactive Financing To assist the government with early impLementa-
tion of the project expenditures (professional fees, technical assistance,
equipment, furniture, educational materials, training, salaries and other
operating cost including office rental) incurred between January 1, 1985 and
the date of signing of the Development Credit Agreement, amounting to
US$500,000 would be eligible for reimbursement retroactively under the
Credit.
3.19    Local Budget Requirements Budget allocations would be made available
to the project on an annual basis in accordance with the Forecast of Expendi-
tures and Disbursements shown in Annex 8. The approval of the PC-1 by ECNEC
would be a condition of Credit effectiveness. During negotiations, the
government provided assurances that the necessary funds would be made avail-
able annually to ensure prompt project implementation and make availabLe not
later than one month before the commencement of each fiscal year a statement
indicating that sufficient funds have been allocated for the annuaL op%.ration
and maintenance of physicaL facilities financed under the project.
3.20    Special Account.  To ensure that project activities are carried out
promptly, the Government would open a SpeciaL Account at the National Bank of
Pakistan; IDA would place an initial deposit of US$ 3.5 miLlion equivalent
representing the estimated amount of four months expenditure on IDA financed
items at the peak period of disbursement. The opening of the Special Account
would be made in accordance with Section 2.02 of the Development Credit
Agreement and it would have three sub-accounts one for each participating
province.
3.21    Recurrent Cost.  Because of the severe difficulties encountered by
provincial governments in meeting the relatively large recurrent costs
imposed by the education sector, efforts ( e.g. by use of low maintenance
buildings, by reduced dropout and by employing assistant teachers) have been
made under the project to reduce the recurrent costs per Grade V graduate.
Additional recurrent costs generated by the project would be financed out of
the Credit on a declining basis.  However, a'ter completion, the recurrent
cost burden would have to be assumed by the provinces. The extent of this
burden at January 1985 prices for each province is indicated in Table 3.4.
In addition Credit 892-PAK will impose an added burden of about eight million
rupees per annum nationwide, mainly for additional staff costs. Most of
these staff are indispensible to the activities of the proposed project.

3.22    One of the chief benefits of a project of this kind must be to reduce
unit costs in the educaticn system. This can be demonstrated by assuming
that primary children who fail to reach Grade V are at best semi-literate and
are likely to lapse into functional illiteracy, with little or no derived
educational benefit from their school experience. The productive output of
the primary sub-sector therefore consists of the number of Grade V graduates.
From this point of view, the cost of producing a Grade V graduate is an index
of unit costs in the system. If it is assumed that the additional project
inputs can reduce drop-out by 50Z of current levels it can be shown that the
cost of producing a Grade V enrollee in Sind would be about Rs 283 compared
to Rs 523 at present, while in Baluchistan the costs would be similarly
reduced to about Rs 888 from Rs 1525 at present.
E. Procurement
3.23    Procurement Plan.  Procurement arrangements are summarized in the
Table 3.5.
3.24    Contracts for US$ 50,000 or above for building components and
vehicles (USs 32.33 million) would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Local
contractors or manufacturers would receive a margin of preference in bid
evaluation of 7.5X on civil works and building components or 15Z on vehicles
of the CIF price of competing imports or the actual customs duty, whichever
is the lower. Contracts for furniture, equipment and small purchases of
building components (US$ 3.25 million) would be awarded on the basis of local
competitive bidding following procedures which are satisfactory to the
Association and do not exclude foreign bidders. Educational materials
produced locally in each province (US$ 4.52 million) and some civil works
construction (US$ 2.10 million), which would be scattered over about 6,000
different school sites, wouLd be procured by locally awarded contracts
(totalling US$ 6.62 million) under local bidding procedures acceptable to
the Association. Force account would be used for procurement of some civil
works, employing loc_lly available labor and using locally procured materials
(US$ 2.10 million). Other procurement methods would be used for some equip-
ment and vehicles (U-$ 0.10 million) in the start-up phase of the project
and for educational materials (US$ 2.34 million) to be produced in each
province.

3.25    IDA Review of Procurement Decisions.  Prior approval of the Associa-
tion would be required for the award of any building components and civil
works contract to cost the equivalent of US$ 500,000 and for contracts for
furniture, equipment, vehicles and educational materials exceeding
US$ 100,000 equivalent resulting in coverage of about 852 of building com-
ponents and works contracts and 75% of other goods contracts.
F. Disbursements
3.26    The proposed Credit would be disbursed over a period of five years
which is shorter than the average country disbursement profile of IDA
assisted projects in Pakistan during the period 1972-1982. The reduction is
justified due to the availability of sites, the advanced stage of preparatory
work (e.g. the preparation of initial district tranche proposals and the
preparation of bidding documents for the procurement of classroom buildings)
and on the basis of achievement and prompt completion of Credit 892-PAK which
was managed by the same government agency. A forecast of disbursements based
on a five year project and adjusted to reflect the project implementation
schedule is shown in Annex 8. The Credit would finance 80% of total pro-ect
costs net of taxes in the following manner:
Category                     Z of Expenditures to be Financed
1. Civil works and building
components.
(i) for the rehabilitation          60%
of classrooms and the
construction of boundary
walls.
(ii) other                           95%
2. Furniture, equipment and
vehicles.
(i) goods                           100% of foreign expenditures and

and maintenance cost.               expenditures (100, 80, 60, 40, 20)



-21-
3.27    Disbursements for small civil works and furniture contracts for the
equivalent of US$ 50,000 or less, salaries of additional staff and other
operational costs would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure
(SOEs). Reimbursement applications would be submitted on a quarterly basis
for amounts equivalent to US$50,000 or more. Other disbursements would be
fully documented.
G. Accounting and Auditing
3.28    The FCU and PIUs would prepare and maintain project accounts in
accordance with sound accounting practices. Separate project accounts would
be prepared and withdrawal applications would be supported by full documenta-
tion. Expenditures against SOEs would be certified by the provincial Project
Directors. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:
(a) accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year would be prepared
and audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; and (b) certified
copies of the audited accounts, SOEs and financial statements for each fiscal
year, together with the Auditor's report would be furnished to IDA as soon as
available, but not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year.
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01    The first project (Credit 892-PAK) provided sufficient evidence of
successful and unsuccessful strategies for the development of primary educa-
tion in Pakistan,and indicated some low cost ways of achieving both a
qualitative and quantitative improvement in the sub-sector. The second
project would utilize and extend the use of this experience. Thus one of the
more important benefits of the project is to provide the government with a
strategy for the development and implementation of long-term programs in the
primary education sub-sector.
4.02    The emphasis in the project is on achieving quality improvements.
The coverage of 14,000 schools representing about 60Z of the schools in the
participating provinces should have a large impact on improving literacy,
lowe-ing unit costs in the sub-sector, and promoting a general awareness -of
the benefits of education among the population. This in turn would have
benefits in facilitating agricultural extension work and improved farm
productivity. Similarly, improved levels of education would contribute to
improvements in health, hygiene and help to lower population growth rates.
4.03    The implementation of this project by tranches will give dis-
trict-level officials responsibility for establishing targets, adopting
overall strategies to fit local conditions, and preparing proposals for
allocating resources. Substantial improvements in local planning and manage-
ment capabilities can therefore be expected as a result of this shift of
responsibility from provincial to district levels.
Risks
4.04    The most important input component of the project is the development
of learning modules. Without good learning modules other project inputs
alone cannot fully achieve the project objectives. While learning modules



-22-
have been used in other countries with some success (Philippines, Indonesia,
Liberia, Bangladesh and the U.S.A.) they are a new concept in Pakistan's
education system and there is no accumulation of experience on how to develop
and use them. The risk that this new input will fail to achieve its full
objectives can be minimized only by the careful recruitment of staff to work
as a team on this aspect of the project and by expatriates with appropriate
experience to advise on the methodolgy to be employed.
4.05    The first IDA intervention in primary education in Pakistan was an
experimental project with considerable risks attached to it. Its eventual
success was the result of strong top management coupled with initiative and
communications from the administrative and field staff emploved under the
project. As with the first project the risks will be reduced by ensuring
that there are strong management teams in each province. The first project
also proved that under good management the strong commitment of field staff
will result in a high degree of initiative and effort directed towards the
success of the project. Technical support services, to meet needs for exper-
tise in special fields such as the development of learning modules, data
collection, analysis and evaluation will also help to reduce the risks
inherent in the project.
V. AGREED ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN BY THE GOVERINMENT
5.01    As  conditions of Credit effectiveness the government agreed to take
the following actions:-
(a) submiL a detailed schedule and syllabus of in-service
courses for IDA approval (para 2.08);
(b) appoint four project directors one for the FCU and one for
each PIU (para 3.01);
(c) obtain full approval of the PC1 project document from ECNEC
(para 3.19); and
(d) open a Special Account at the National Bank of Pakistan in
accordance with Section 2.02 of the Development Credit Agreement
(para 3.20).
5.02    During negotiations, the government provided assurances that:
(a) (i) the specifications and prototypes of the learning modules would
be developed in a manner satisfactory to IDA; (ii) they would be
developed, in consultation with the Provinces, in accordance with
guidelines, a work program and a schedule satisfactory to IDA; (iii)
a detailed syllabus of in-service courses would be prepared and
furnished to IDA for approval; and (iv) the modules would be used
immediately after development and thereafter for such in-service
courses (para 2%08);
p
(b) the selection of schools for school building improvement would be
made in accordance with guidelines acceptable to IDA (para 2.09);



-23-
(c) the terms of reference, qualifications and conditions of employment
of all consultants be acceptable to IDA (para 2.14);
(d) the FCU and PIUs, established under Credit 892-PAK, would be main-
tained and strengthened in a manner satisfactory to IDA and; to this
end the Project Directors and other staff necessary for carrying out
the Project including staff specified in Annex 5 would be appointed
in accordance with a schedule satisfactory to IDA (para 3.01).
(e) implementation tranche proposals for each of the participating
provinces would be prepared in accordance with guidelines acceptable
to IDA; no later than three months from the effectiveness date the
government would furnish to IDA for review the second implementation
tranche proposal for the three provinces and it would furnish to IDA
for review the implementation tranche proposals for the third through
fifth tranches for each of the provinces in accordance with a
schedule acceptable to IDA (para 3.04);
(f) necessary funds would be made available to ensure prompt project
implementation and a statement would be made available not later than
one month before the commencement of each fiscal year, indicating
that sufficient funds have been allocated for the annual operation
and maintenance of physical facilities financed under the project
(3.19); and
(g) accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year would be
prepared and audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; and
certified copies of the audited accounts, SOEs and financial state-
ments for each fiscal year, together with the Auditors report would
be furnished to IDA as soon as available, but not later than nine
months after the end of each fiscal year (para 3.28).
5.03    Subject to the above conditions and assurances, the proposed project
constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$ 52.50 million, to the
Covernment of Pakistan for a term of 50 years, including a 10 year grace
period.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
SECOND PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
Draft Guidelines for the Preparation of
Learning Modules and In-Service Training Program
r. INTRODUCTION
1.01    The linch-pin of the various categories of inputs that would be
directet at improvements in the teachers' classroom performance would be a
set of teaching/learning modules that would be developed expressly for this
project. As illustrated in Figure 3-1, these modules would serve as the
basis for in-service training courses to be provided to teachers, Assistant
Teachers, Learning Coordinators, and other supervisory personnel; as
post-training guides and reminders for the teachers when they return to the
classrooms; as learning aids for the students; as focal points for supervi-
sion and on-the-job remedial training; and as vehicles for further research
on the use of standardized learning materials to upgrade student achievement.
1.02    Although the objectives to be achieved through the use of learning
modules are formidable and may not be entirely achieved during the life of
the project, these ultimate objectives and the many uses to which the learn-
ing modules would be put when ultimately developed is fully described herein.
Even if they serve just as teacher's guides and for teacher training and
achieve very little else they will have been worth introducing. By continual
feedback of information concerning their effectiveness in teacher training
and the school classroom (through SLC observations) they can continually
undergo revision and improvement thereby becoming more effective in achieving
more of their ultimate objectives. These draft guidelines have been prepared
to assist the Federal Coordination Unit (FCU) in planning the development
work, and mobilizing the manpower necessary to complete it on a timely basis
during the ongoing project.
1.03    Because of their central importance and the dependence of other
inputs on their effective completion, a set of teaching/learning modules
sufficient to support the first year's in-service training courses would have
to be ready soon after the date of project effectiveness. A detailed
schedule and syllabus for the first year's courses would be submitted for IDA
approval as a condition of Credit effectiveness (paras 2.08 and 5.01).

ANNEX 3

II. DESCRIPTION OF MODULES
2.01    A separate set of modules would be developed for each Grade (I
through V) and each subject.
2.02    The first step in developing a set of modules would be to identify
the specific, demonstrable skills that the student is expected to develop as
a result of the instruction given in that subject at that level. Each of
these skills would be defined as a Clear and Demonstrable Outcome (CanDO) to
be achieved by the student. It would be described in operational, measurable
terms in a sentence or paragraph (as necessary) that would indicate clearly
(a) the problem on other "givens" to which the student is to be able to
respond when using this skill, and (b) the criteria that determine whether
the student's response is appropriate and sufficient.

ANNEX 3
Page 3
2.03    A separate and self-sufficient module would be developed for each
CanDO. It would consist of three major components (in addition to the opera-
tional description of the skill), as summarized in Figure 1, and as detailed
further below.
2.04    The first component would be a set of exercises for the teacher to
use to demonstrate and explain the skill to the students. These would take
the form of step-by-step instructions for the teacher to follow, including
such sketches and diagrams as may be necessary to explain the intended demon-
stration procedure. From the standpoint of requirements for instructional
materials, the modules would be of three types:
(1) Modules that require no materials other than
chalk and blackboard or other items that should
be at hand.
(2) Modules that require materials that the teacher
should be able to assemble locally (e.g. pebbles)
or manufacture (e.g. geometric cut-outs).
(3) Modules that require special materials (e.g. magnets)
that would have to be supplied as part of the module
if not already provided to primary schools.
Every effort would be made to minimize the requirements for special materials
to reduce costs and simplify the problems of distribution and storage. When
a particular item clearly is necessary to demonstrate the skill in an effec-
tive manner, however, that item would be supplied.
2.05    The second component would be a set of ezercises for the students to
wo-k through to practice the skill. These exercises would be designed in
accordance with the principles of self-instructional materials. They would
begin with extremely simple applications of the skill (or parts of it) and
build in small steps to mastery. They would allow ample opportunity for
repetition so as to be suitable for slow as well as more rapid learners.
Like the demonstration materials, they would consist of three basic types:
(1) Exercises set by the teacher (e.g. arithmetic
problems) in accordance with instructions specified
as part of the module.
(2) Exercises based on durable (i.e. reusable) items
supplied as part of the module, such as wall charts,
individual booklets or cards, Cuisenaire rods, etc.
(3) Exercises requiring consumable items that must be
restocked each year.



-32-
ANNEX 3
Page 4
Every effort would be made to limit the consumable items to essentials.
2.06    The third component would be a test of mastery. It wouLd consist of:
(1) A mastery test to be administered to the students
to indicate the extent to which each has mastered
the skill.
(2) A set of instructions for developing alternate forms
of this test for use by the teachers to develop fresh
tests for testing slower learners, and by Learning
Coordinators to verify that it is the skill and not
a particular set of test questions that the students
have mastered.
The mastery test would constitute the ultimate criterion for evaluating the
effectiveness of instruction.
III. MODULES FOR IN-SERVICE TRAINING
3.01    Developing a full set of learning modules for all grades and all
subjects before the project begins would not be feasible. The goal would be
to develop a sufficient set of modules to support the initial set of
in-service courses, and to develop the remainder and phase them into use
during the first three years of the project.
3.02    The modules to be developed for the initial tranche of in-service
courses would be limited to two subjects (Mathematics a--I Science) and three
grades (I-II-III for Mathematics and III-IV-V for Science).
3.03    A total of 12 modules would be developed for each subject at each
grade level (72 modules in all). The 12 modules would not be expected to
cover all of the CanDO's that have been identified as iLv-ortant to mastery of
that subject at that level. They would be seLected to constitute a
reasonably representative sample of them, however, inclLiing topics from both
early and later parts of the course.
3.04    The initial set of modules would be developed centrally by consult-
ants or under a turn-key contract, under the generaL direction of the FCU.
Each Provincial Implementation Unit (PIU) would take responsibility for any
necessary adaptations to fit local conditions, for reproduction in the requi-
site numbers, and for distribution to the Districts. (Full advantage would
be taken of any economies of scale that could be realized by producing
modules that do not require adaptation centrally to achieve lower unit
costs).
3.05    The initial tranche of in-service courses would include instruction
not only in the effective use of the modules already available, but also in
the design of modules for topics not covered-by the initial set. Teachers



-33-
ANNEX 3
Page 5
would be encouraged to develop additional modules during the course of the
year with the assistance of the Learning Coordinators, who in turn would be
encouraged to forward any exemplary modules to the PIUs, and through the PIUs
to the MFU, for refinement and inclusion in the master set. Though only a
small proportion of teachers would be expected to produce generally useful
modules, it nevertheless would be anticipated that most if not all of the
"gaps" in the initial set could be filled in this manner, and that a fairly
complete set of modules for these subjects and grade levels would be avail-
able by the time the second tranche of in-service courses begins in the
second year of the project.
3.06    This pattern would be repeated in each of the next two years.  During
the first year of the project (and again during the second), the FCU would
develop 12 modules each for other subjects and grades, to be introduced in
the second tranche of in-service courses (and again in the third), and as
before to be expanded into a complete set by teachers in the field. Modules
spanning the entire primary school curriculum would have been developed and
distributed by the fourth year of the project.
IV. PLAN FOR MODULES DEVELOPMENT
4.01    The plan for the development of the modules that would be presented
to IDA at negotiations would cover the following topics:
(1) Outcomes to be Achieved:  A complete list of the clear
and demonstrable outcomes that constitute the important
skills to be learned in Mathematics and Science at the
three selected grade levels, developed under the auspices
of the FCU and agreed to by each Province.
(2) The Initial Set of Modules: The 72 CanDO's of the above
set for which modules would be developed during the ongoing
project, and the reasons these were selected.
(3) Module Specifications:  Detailed specifications for the
characteristics of suitable modules, including standards each
must meet, in sufficient detail to be used as a procedural
guide by subject matter specialist preparing modules.
(4) Personnel and Schedule: Details concerning the individuals
and institutions that would take responsibility for
preparing, editing, testing, and revising modules, including
arrangements for specialist consultants and a projected
timetable of events.
(5) Field Testing: Plan and design for testing each module under
actual classroom conditions, with techers and students from
representative areas.



-34-
ANNE 3
Page 6
4.02    A set of six prototype modules (3 Mathematics, 3 Science) when comm-
pleted would be appended to the plan. Topics-would be selected to iLlustrate
different types of modules with respect to the use of generally available,
teacher-made, or specially provided materials. Each prototype would be of a
quality that would make it suitable for use as an exemplar for subject matter
specialists preparing modules.
V. CONDUCT OF IN-SERVICE TRAIINING
5.01    The plan for in--service training to be presented to IDA prior to
project effectiveness would cover two major topics:
(1) The program of instruction, with special reference
to the approach to be used to teach the effective use
of the existing modules, including practice sessions;
and the approach to be used to teach the development
of similar modules on other topics, including
individualized projects.
(2) The instructional staff, with special reference to the
role of the central staff w~ho supervized the developmient
of the modules in conducting sessions and/or training
the trainers.
5.02    The provincial training schedules for the first tranche of in-service
courses would be appended, including any necessary explanations of the arran-
gements for transporting and housing the participants.
5.03    The 72 modules t o be used for these courses also would be appended,
as would a brief report on the results of the field testing and the nature of
subsequent revisions.

SECOND PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
Draft Guidelines for the Preparation of District Proposals
and School Building Improvements
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01    Because of the more flexible approach that is proposed for the
management of the second primary education project, detailed design at the
Tehsil level would be undertaken in the project districts in a phased
sequence throughout the project's life. As a condition of Board Presenta-
tion, a detailed design for the first tranche of implementation would be
submitted for IDA approval.
1.02    These draft guidelines agreed to during appraisal have been orepared
to facilitate the preparation of tranche proposals to make them more readily
acceptable to the various clearance authorities including (i) provincial
departments of education, (ii) the federal coordination unit and (iii) IDA.
Both the respective PIU and the FCU would conduct full field appraisal of
each tranche proposal.
1.03    These guidelines would be finalized and agreed to at negotiations.
Any change in these guidelines would require IDA approval.
II. PHASING
2.01    Inputs would be introduced on a geographically phased basis, in
accordance with the capacity of existing management structures.
2.02    The introduction of inputs in each geographical increment would be
completed before expanding to the next.
2.03    On the basis of information collected during the appraieal, the
preliminary phasing plan would be:

2.04    This preliminary phasing plan could be modified if necessary, main-
taining comparable levels of effort in the successive tranches. A final
plan, approved by each province, would be presented at the time of nego-
tiations.
III. DISTRICT ADMINISTRATION
3.01    To assist offices and district administrators to undertake additional
responsibilities (i} for supervision of schools (ii) supervision of project
activities and (iii) the preparation of implementation proposals (according
to the sequence of tranches above), certain items of support would be
provided to district offices.
3.02    According to need, this support would take the form of (i) the provi-
sion of additional professional and administrative staff positions, (ii)
vehicles, (iii) allowances for office furniture and project-related overhead
costs.
3.03    All of thege District level inputs would be made at the beginning of
the project in the Districts that are participating in the on-going primary
project, and in the second year of the project in the expansion Districts
(Kohat, Nasirabad, and Turbat) that would be joining in the project at that
time.
IV. LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION PLANS
4.01    Notwithstanding the schedule of implementation projected in the
phasing plan, implementation would not be undertaken in any tehsil until a
detailed implementation plan has been prepared by the District Education
Office, and approved by the Provincial Education Department and the Federal
Coordination Unit (FCU).



-38-
ANNEX 4
Page 4
4.02    Local Implementation Plans would be divided into 7 sections as fol-
lows:
(I)   STATUS, APPROACH AND TARGETS
(II)  PROPOSED SUPERVISION ARRANGEMENTS
(III) PROPOSED USE OF ASSISTANT TEACHERS
(IV)  PROPOSED TRAINING SCHEDULE
(V)   PROPOSED PLANS FOR CONSTRUCTION
(VI)  PLANS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF LEARNING MATERIALS
(VII) PLANS FOR COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
Because of the substantial differences in the development of male and female
education, separate implementation plans would be prepared for boys' and
girls' schools in each tehsil.
4.03    Status, Approach, and Targets:  The first section of the plan would
summarize the current status of primary education in the tehsil with respect
to (a) participation, (b) drop-out, (c) pupil achievement, and (d) community
support. It would identify the locations at which there is a reasonable
opportunity for achieving marked improvements in these aspects in the next
two years, and describe the ways in which the resources provided by the
project would set targets for improvements in (a) participation rates, (b)
drop-out rates, (c) scores on achievement tests, and (d) community contribu-
tions that are realistic and in the light of local conditions, and constitute
fair criteria for evaluating the results of the project.
4.04    Proposed Supervision Arrangements:  The second section would indicate
the number of Learning Coordinators that is necessary to provide effective
supervision in this tehsil, the schools for which each would be responsible,
and the site at which each would be stationed. The guidelines to be followed
would be:
(1' Male Learning Coordinators would be responsible
for no more than 15-20 schools. Female Learning
Coordinators would be responsible for no more than
10-15 schools.
(2) Insofar as practical, the "beats" of the Learning
Coordinators would be consistent with the
configuration of Union Councils.
(3) Sites selected for female Learning Coordinators would
be sites for which qualified individuals reasonably
can be recruited.
If deviations from (1) or (2) are necessary to fit local conditions, the
reasons for each deviation would be explained.



-39-
ANNEX 4
Page 5
4.05    Plans for supervising these Learning Coordinators also would be
presented.  In Sind, adequate supervision would require the establishment of
additional management positions at the tehsil level - Assistant Sub-District
Education Officers (ASDEOs) in the case of males, and Sub-District Education
Officers (SDEOs) in the case of females. In N.W.F.P., where there is a
larger supervisory structure already in place, and in Baluchistan, where the
number of Learning Coordinators is substantially smaller, only a few addi-
tions would be required to the existing tehsil management structure.
4.06    Preliminary estimates of the supervisory positions that wouLd have to
be established to implement the project in the first tranche of tehsils are
shown in Table I-1. (Estimates for the project as a whole are given in the
Annex 2). These estimates would be adjusted as appropriate; the reasons for
adjustments would be explained in this section of the plan.
4.07    Since effective supervision requires extensive travel, the purchase
and recurrent costs of conveyances also would be provided by the project.
At the tehsil level the standard schedule would be as follows:
One van and driver per male SDEO, and one motorcycle
per male ASDEO, to be used primarily for supervising
the work of the male Learning Coordinators; one
motorcycle per male Learning Coordinator, to be used
exclusively for school visits.
One van and driver per female SDEO, and one van and
driver per female ASDEO, to be used primarily for
transporting the female Learning Coordinators to
schools on a fixed and regular schedule.
Conveyances for SDEOs and ASDEOs would be provided
Loth to incumbents in the existing positions and to
appointees to the additional positions established
under the project.
If deviations from this schedule are proposed in the local implementation

4.08    In addition to the above costs, the salaries, allowances, and tran-
sportation costs of Learning Coordinators appointed under the ongoing project
but stationed in tehsils not included in the first tranche would be supportec
under the project until it is implemented in their tehsils, at which time
they would be re-appointed or re-assigned to help fill the stipulated posi-
tions. The locations and costs associated with these "holdover" Learning
Coordinators also would be detailed in this section of the plan.
4.09    A rough map (sketch) of the tehsil, showing the "beats" to be covered
by the Learning Coordinators, and a list of the schools included in each beat
would be appended to the plan. For each school, accurate information would
be given on current enrollment (by grade and sex), number of teachers and
qualifications, and the number and condition of rooms.

ANNEX 4
Page 7
4.10    Proposed Use of Assistant Teachers:  The third section would indicate
the number of Assistant Teachers to be appointed in this tehsil, the schools
to which they would be posted, and the reasons that these assignments are
thought to be the most productive use of this resource to help realize the
goals of the project. The general guidelines would be:
(1) The strategy being followed in the ongoing project
of appointing only female Assistant Teachers in Sind,
and both male and female Assistant Teachers in the
other provinces would be continued.
(2) Assistant Teachers would be appointed at Pay Grade 6.
(3) An average of 4 Assistant Teachers would be appointed
per Learning Cocrdinator.
(4) No more than 1 Assistant Teacher would be posted at
any school; only schools that have at least 1 and
preferably 2 regular teachers would be considered.
(5) First preference in assignments would be given to
schools that meet all of the criteria for the
construction of additional rooms (see below) except
for the lack of one additional teacher.
(6) Second preference would be given to schools that have
adequate facilities but inadequate number of teachers
to meet the demand for primary education at their
locations.
Deviations from these guidelines would be explained in this section of the
plan.
4.11    Proposed Training Schedule:  The fourth section could present a
schedule for in-service training consistent with the timetable of courses
(dates and locations) published by the Provincial Implementation Unit (PIU).
The general guidelines would be:
(1) Courses would be resident courses of two weeks'
duration; they would focus on the effective use of
the teaching materials and Learning modules being
developed under the project.
(2) Approximately half of the teachers in the tehsil
would attend the course in each of the first two
years of the implementation of the project in that
tehsil. Teachers who do not attend either of these
two offerings for any reasons (e.g., leave,



-42-
ANNEX 4
Page 8
re-assignment, etc) would attend the course in the
third year of the project.
(3) Learning Coordinators would participate in the course
once each year. They would be accompanied by the
teachers from schools for which they are responsible
who are taking the course that year (and who would be
scheduled to attend it as a group).
(4) ASDEOs and supervisors appointed under the Special
Development Program would attend the course once in
the first year of project implementation in the tehsil.
Deviations from these guidelines would be explained in this section of the
plan.
4.12    Proposed Plans for Construction:  The fifth section would detail the
physical facilities to be constructed under the project, the specific schools
at which this construction would be done, and the reasons that make these the
most appropriate choices to achieve the goals of the project. Ceneral
guidelines for this component are given in paras 6.01 - 7.03 of this Annex.
4.13    Plan for Distribution of Learning Materials:  The sixth section would
describe the arrangements that would be made for distributing learning
materials to all schools in the tehsil. Materials would be available from
the PIU. Since they include consumable as well as durable items, there waould
be a new distribution each year.
4.14    Plans for Community Involvement:  The final section would describe
the steps that have been taken to develop greater community participation and
support, and the additional steps that are planned. The topics to be covered
include:
(1) The extent to which leaders of each community
participated in the development of the implementation
plan;
(2) The mechanisms that have been or would be developed
for keeping community leaders informed of the progress
the project is making, and of problems that cannot be
resolved without their assistance; and
(3) The kinds of support that each community reasonably
can be expected to provide to the local school, and
the steps that would be taken to obtain it.
Since the situation would vary from community to community, there would be a
separate discussion for each of the majo- communities served by the primary
schools of that tehsil.



-43-
ANNEX 4
Page 9
V. UPDATES AND REVISION
5.01    Quarterly progress reports would be submitted by each District to the
Provincial Education Department and the PIU. Topics would include:
(1) Status of appointments at District level and related
logistic support.
(2) Changes in status with respect to (a) participation,
(b) drop-out, (c) pupil achievement, and (d) community
support in each tehsiL, relative to the status reported
in the local implementation plan (or the preceding
progress report).
(3) Status of implementation in each tehsil with respect
to targets for increased supervision (appointments,
frequency of visits, documented accomplishments);
assistant teachers (appointments, indications of
performance); in-service training; civil works; and
distribution of materials and other equipment.
Shortfalls in inputs and/or results relative to plans would be explained in
detail. As appropriate, revised targets would be proposed.
Meetings of the participating DEOs would be held quarterly in each
Province; an annual meeting of DEOs from all Provinces would be hosted by the
FCU. The purpose of these meetings would be to exchange experiences and
ideas, and to identify aspects of the project plan and/or its implementation
that should be revised. Revisions consistent with the general project
guidelines would be considered and approved by the FCU.
VI. SCHOOL BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS
6.01    Primary school enrollments in Pakistan tend toward extremes.  There
are many large primary schools (often attached to high or middle schools)
that have enrollments of 300 or more. There are many small primary schools
with enrollments of fewer than 50, sometimes even fewer than 20, students
scattered across the primary grades. Neither extreme is an appropriate model
for the development of suitable and cost effective facilities at the vast
majority of rura3 locations.
6.02    An appropriate model would be a school with three sound classrooms
and a verandah (which studies have shown to be the most cost-effective com-
bination for schools of moderate size), a staff of at least three teachers,
and an enrollment of 120-200, with such other amenities as can be provided
through local community support, including a storage room, a water room (or
water supply), and latrines. A boundary wall would be an essential component
for girls' schools and a highly desirable component for boys' schools.



-44-
ANNEX 4
Page 10
6.03    The strategy that would be followed in the second project would be to
identify schools that nearly satisfy this model, and upgrade them to meet it.
This would maximize the number of cost effective schools that would be
created with the limited resources available for construction and civil
works.
6.04    These guidelines are intended to help provincial and district plan-
ners develop a maximally productive strategy for the school building com-
ponent in each tehsil. The specific plan developed would be included in the
Local Development Plan as para 4.12 of this Annex. Deviations from these
guidelines would require the approval of the FCU and IDA.
VII. CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR BUILDIKC IMPROVEMENT
7.01    The allocation of school classrooms would be determined according
to the following guidelines and with the following priorities:
(i) two existing classrooms which are sound and
weatherproof;
(ii) at least three teachers;
(iii) an enrollment of c. 100-180;
(iv) a level site that affords sufficient and suitable
space for expansion.
Second  riorit  will be given to the provision of one additional classroom at
boys' and girls' schools that comply with the criteria for the first priority
but:
i) need repairs to existing rooms, provided such repairs
are completed before the additional classroom is installed;
and/or
ii) need additional teachers to be assigned, provided that:
(i) such additional teachers are designated before the
additional classroom is installed; (ii) no school will
have more than one assistant teacher.
Third priority will be given to the provision of one additional classroom at
girls' schools that:
i) meet the criteria of the first or second priority with
the exception of iii (enrollment);
and/or



-45-
ANNEX 4
Page 11
ii) are in a catchment area that is judged able to support
a girls' enrollment of 150-200.
Fourth priority will be given to the provision of one additional classroom at
boys schools that otherwise satisfy the third priority criteria.
Fifth priority will be given to the provision of two classrooms to a boys' or
girls  school without any building but having, in government ownership, a
level site affording sufficient and suitable space and having an enrollment
of 100 or more students and two teachers.
Sixth priority will be given to the provision of two additional classrooms at
schools that are eligiL'e for selection under above priorities one through
four (in order) except that they possess only one sound classroom and need
two additional classrooms.
Seventh priority will be given to the establishment of a schooL for Crades
IV and V only by the provision of two classrooms, conditional upon the
appointment of two teachers (one of whom can be an assistant teacher) and
where there is, in government ownership, a level site affording sufficient
and suitable space not within 3 km distance of any other school having Grades
IV and V but within 3km distance of enough mosque schools with sufficient
total grade III enrollments which would ensure an enrollment of 50 or more
students in the new school at Grade IV.
Eighth eriority will be given to the provision of one additional classroom
at boys' or girls' schools where the enrollment is at Least 60 per classroom
and there are at least two classrooms and one teacher per classroom (includ-
ing the additional classroom).
7.02    Schools selected for the installation of additional classrooms also
will be eligible for financial assistance for the cost of ancillary works
such as boundary walls, repairs to existing faciltities, verandah etc.
Scales of allocation under the project will be:
Rs. 8,000 - for the cost of boundary walls;
Rs. 2,500 - for necessary repairs to each classroom
as identified under the second priority;
7.03    The school in each Union Council that has the largest number of
classrooms, if suitably located to act as a Resource Center, may be selected
to serve as a base for learning ^oordinators, for storing learning modules,
for in-service training and community training. Resource Centers would be
eligible, if resources remain, for the addition of one classroom as follows:
(i) a school with three functionally sound classroom would receive one addi-
tional classroom; (ii) a school with four functionally sound classrooms would
receive one additional classroom. These criteria can be used to provide an
extra classroom to the primary section of a middle school.

SECOND PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
Project Management Structure and Staffing
1.      The Federal Management Unit and the three Provincial Implementation
Units would be staffed in accordance with their respective roles in the
conduct of the project. The FCU would maintain a core professional staff
responsible for supervision of the projects undertaken in the three provin-
ces, the compilation of results and their effective dissemination, and the
appraisal of proposals for implementing successive tranches. The PIUs would
maintain administrative and technical staffs responsible for assistance and
guidance to District and Sub-District officials in the conduct of ongoing
projects and the preparation of new proposals, for arranging and overseeing
in-service training, and for insuring the smooth flow of descriptive and
evaluative data.
2.      To strengthen the central role of the FCU in procuring buildings an
agency (CM) would be appointed to pre-qualify contractors, prepare bidding
documents, evaluate bids and make recommendations on the choice of classroom
building (para 3.08).
3.      While 75X of these staff were in post (under Credit 892-PAK) at the
date of appraisal, the new project requirements are indicated in the follow-
ing table irrespective of whether the post was filled or not, since vacant
position are occuring more frequently as Credit 892-PAK approaches comple-
tion.
4.      Estimates of the recurrent costs associated with these operations
total Rs. 21.1 million for the FCU and three PIUs over the life of the
Project. This represents approximately 2.5 percent of the total project
costs.
