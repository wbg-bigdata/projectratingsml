1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
With a population of 1.8 million (2006 census data) and gross national income of
US$1,000 per capita in 2007, Lesotho is a small, poor, landlocked economy, completely
surrounded by the Republic of South Africa. Two-thirds of its land area is comprised of
mountain areas, with less than 10 percent suitable for crop cultivation. Domestically
generated income from agriculture is supplemented by declining remittances from
Basotho mine workers in South Africa, royalties from the supply of water to South Africa
from the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, official development assistance, and by a
mostly foreign-owned garments industry. The latter exports mostly to the U.S. market,
and is exposed to the risks of eroding preferential trade terms. Lesotho's future potential
is highly dependent on the development of its human resources.

Lesotho was ranked 149 out of 177 on the Human Development Index, higher than many
other African countries but low in global terms. Its adult literacy rate is relatively high at
84 percent. In 2002, the gross primary enrollment rate was over 100 percent but the net
enrollment rate was only about 85 percent, while the secondary enrollment rate was only
29 percent, reflecting the limited capacity prevalent in secondary schools. In regard to
tertiary education, the country's performance was even poorer: Less than 2 percent of
young people between 18 and 20 were enrolled in tertiary institutions.

In addition to the challenges it faces in the education sector, Lesotho has also the highest
HIV/AIDS prevalence rate among the world's poorest countries: 24 percent of the adult
population was HIV-positive in 2006. At the time of project design, the infection rate
was estimated to be over 30 percent and the number of AIDS orphans over 70,000.

The Second Education Sector Development Program (ESDP II) was designed in 1999
as a 12-year three-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL) to support the education sector.
The goal of the 12-year program was to assist the Government of Lesotho (GOL) to
increase the number and level of educated Basotho and enable them to participate in local
and regional labor markets. The 1999 ESDP II Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for
Phase 1 stated that the program purpose was to produce: more Basotho better educated,
and actively employed both regionally and locally and participating in community
leadership roles. The ESDP II was to be implemented in three phases: Phase 1 (1999-
2002), Phase 2 (2003-2006), and Phase 3 (2007-2011), with analytical work completed in
each Phase intended to underpin investment decisions for the subsequent Phase.

The ESDP II Phase 1 (Credit 3192) had an IDA allocation of US$21 million (and an
expected GOL contribution of US$5.7 million). The project development objectives
(PDO) were to assist GOL in its effort to increase the access to and equity of primary and
secondary education, as well as improve their quality. Further, Phase 1 supported the
Government in the development of a policy and institutional framework for early
childhood care and development (ECCD), technical and vocational education and
training (TVET), and non-formal education (NFE). The closing date of Phase 1 was



                                               1

extended for an additional year up to December 31, 2003, by which time it had achieved
most of its objectives and had a satisfactory outcome rating, including Bank and
Borrower performances. However, ESDP II Phase 1 experienced persistent difficulty in
implementing the TVET and NFE components. Reasons identified included: (a) a lack of
capacity in TVET within the Ministry of Education and Training (MoET); (b) the
introduction of free primary education (FPE) and focus on primary and secondary
education diverted the MoET's attention from TVET; and (c) the complexity of TVET
reform. As a result, while three of the other triggers were achieved, the TVET and the
NFE triggers were not fulfilled by the end of Phase 1. The Decision Meeting determined
that the indicators met were the important indicators and approved the preparation of
Phase 2.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The ESDP II Phase 2 project (with an IDA allocation of US$21 million and GOL
allocation of US$6.2 million) aimed to support the continuation of activities of Phase 1
during the period of September 2003 to December 2007, including support for primary
and secondary education, ECCD, policy work and capacity building in TVET, higher
education and NFE, and MoET institutional strengthening. In addition, the project was
intended to lead on to a third Phase from 2008 to 2011. The PDO were to: (a) increase
enrollment and completion in primary education; (b) improve learning achievement in
primary education; (c) increase enrollment in secondary education; and (d) build capacity
in the education sector, including for ECCD, TVET, higher education, NFE, and MoET
core functions.

reasons/justification
Not applicable

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
The primary beneficiaries of the project were identified as: (a) all primary and some
secondary school-age children; (b) children between the ages of 3 and 5 who would
benefit from increased ECCD coverage; (c) TVET and tertiary students who would
benefit from potentially more relevant and higher quality skills training; and (d) the
participants in the two NFE pilots such as illiterate adults, returning miners and others
seeking additional skills and training. The secondary beneficiaries were expected to
include parents and communities. Finally, MoET officials and teachers would also
benefit from the project because of increased opportunities for training and exposure to
the best practices in education reforms and increased job effectiveness and satisfaction.
Further, the project aimed to target orphans and other disadvantaged children through
better school site selection targeted scholarships and support for ECCD sites in
disadvantaged areas.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The project was divided into four main components: 1) primary education, 2) secondary
education, 3) lifelong learning and 4) strengthening MoET, with the operating costs
forming a fifth component. The four main components had a total of 20 subcomponents,
as outlined in Table 1.

The project was to be implemented by MoET line units, under the overall leadership of
the Principal Secretary (PS) of the MoET and coordinated by the Director of Planning.
The MoET Senior Management Committee, chaired by the PS, was intended to have
responsibility for project implementation and to ensure full integration of the
implementation process into the regular operations of the MoET. The project
Coordination and Support Unit (PSCU) of MoET established during Phase 1 as a


                                                       3

temporary measure to backstop weak capacity in the Planning Unit was to continue
responsibility for financial management, procurement and construction until these
functions could be absorbed within MoET line units.

1.6 Revised Components
The components were not revised. However, at the request of Government there was a
reallocation of US$4 million in IDA finance from primary (construction) to secondary
education (textbook procurement) in 2005 and a further reallocation of over US$1 million
to training of staff in 2007.


1.7 Other significant changes
While there were no major changes in design, the project's total financing increased by
over US$7 million (20%) from the appraisal estimate (see Table 2) due to a favorable
exchange rate resulting in an increase of US$1.6 million in the IDA allocation and an
additional US$5.54 million, which was provided by GOL as counterpart funds.
Government counterpart funds were applied, as agreed in the Credit Agreement, to
finance a proportion of each contract, but additional counterpart funds were used to
finance other activities, mainly the expansion of the PSCU.

There was some change in the focus of spending. Funds were reallocated from various
categories to provide greater support for the provision of secondary school textbooks,
with the approval of the Bank. As a result, the share of expenditure allocated to
secondary education rose from 22 percent to 30 percent. There was also a major deviation
from the planned expenditure in the category of operating costs, which increased from 5
percent to 12 percent of total expenditure. This increase was mainly driven by the
unanticipated expansion of the PSCU, financed through increased provision of
government counterpart funds. The availability of additional counterpart funds to finance
elements not anticipated in the project plan was a concern to the project team, as it
allowed the PSCU (and the operating costs) to grow disproportionately. This issue was
raised repeatedly with the government during supervision. However, after consultation
with the Bank's Financial Management unit and Legal Department, the team was advised
that such additional counterpart contributions were not desirable but did not represent a
breach of the credit agreement because the government was meeting its counterpart
commitments.

The project closing date was extended by one year to December 31, 2008 to enable the
completion of training activities and delivery of furniture to schools and the standard
four-month grace period was granted to conclude disbursements.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The design of ESDP II Phase 2 was guided by the ESDP II framework agreed in 1999
and lessons learned from implementing Phase 1. In addition, the project took account of
three particular developments in education since the design of the APL: (a) the
introduction of the FPE policy in 1999 resulting in significant changes in primary
enrollment patterns; (b) the development and use of the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework as a tool for aligning sector budgets with priorities; and (c) the ongoing
development of an Education Sector Development Plan by Government in consultation
with development partners.

The project team also identified the many challenges remaining to be addressed. At
primary level these included: (a) the apparent stagnation in primary education enrollment
after the initial jump in 2000 after FPE; (b) the low primary completion rate; and (c) the
high wastage. At the secondary level, coverage was low and there were regional and
gender disparities in access. At the ECCD level, access to and quality of services varied
greatly across the country. Further, the policy directions remained to be developed and
capacity was weak for TVET, higher education, and NFE. The project also identified the
serious challenges posed by the attrition of MoET officials, staff, and teachers and the
situation of orphans and other disadvantaged children caused by the high HIV/AIDS
prevalence. Finally, in regard to education financing, while education received a high
share of total Government budget, the share allocated to primary and secondary education
within the overall budget was modest while the share devoted to higher education was
relatively high.

ESDP II Phase 2 was the second phase of an APL and the team and Government were
satisfied with progress in the first phase. The Bank and the Government were in
agreement on objectives and inputs and the project was designed in a very short period (8
months). In the context of the aim by both the borrower and the Bank to move towards a
sector wide approach (SWAp), the project was designed to influence and monitor
developments across the sector, while the direct project finance was confined to specific
interventions mainly in primary and secondary education. Substantial reform of TVET
and Higher Education policy were anticipated, but very little of the project resources
were related to supporting these reforms. As a result of this approach there was a
considerable mismatch between the project interventions and the chosen indicators.

2.2 Implementation
Implementation of the project inputs progressed reasonably well: The civil works were
completed by the close of the project, the planned procurement of textbooks and other
goods progressed as anticipated, and the teacher training, bursary provision and capacity
building components were implemented largely as expected. The 1-year extension


                                               5

allowed for the completion of some of the final items, and by the end of the project, all of
the major project outputs had been implemented and 99.9 percent of IDA funds had been
disbursed.

During project supervision, the Bank team provided assistance to support Lesotho's
successful application for a grant from the Education For All Fast Track Initiative (FTI)
of US$7.2 million (which became effective in September 2006) and a second grant of
US$4.7 million (which became effective January 2008). In addition, the Bank team
supported MoET to develop a sector plan and to organize annual reviews from 2006. The
mid-term review was held in April 2006 following the first annual review in March 2006
and the project benefited from observations by other development partners as well as
GOL.

While the project inputs were implemented as planned, the anticipated policy reforms did
not all proceed as expected. The legislation to reform the TVET sub-sector was delayed
both over concerns regarding the content of the Bill as well as the fall of the government
and subsequent elections. The reforms expected in Higher Education also proceeded
slowly. The Council on Higher Education was established and began its work in
monitoring and regulating tertiary education courses, but remained in the early stages of
this work by the close of the project. Finally, despite the project inputs, the enrollment
patterns in primary education did not change as expected. The introduction of Free
Primary Education resulted in a very large intake into Standard 1, as many older children
and even some adults entered primary school. These early FPE cohorts suffered from
high dropout, and high repetition rates. Following these first FPE cohorts, the intake rate
fell (but remained greater than the number of children age 6), and cohort survival
increased. The progress of these enlarged cohorts through the system has caused some
unusual trends, including falling overall enrollment, and a slight decline in the net
enrolment rate in recent years.

One of the major implementation issues was the unanticipated growth of the PSCU. This
was initially conceived as a temporary support to the MoET, to allow implementation to
progress while capacity was developed in the MoET. In practice however, the PSCU
grew to become the implementing unit for the project, and also an integral part of some
of the core functions of the MoET. By 2007, the PSCU had a staff of over 100, with an
annual salary cost of US$1.3 million (Table 3). The expansion of the PSCU was
attractive to some of the MoET management, as it allowed rapid recruitment of staff as
required, bypassing the normal public service procedures. The PSCU successfully
implemented the major project components, particularly the supervision of construction,
which would not otherwise have been within the capacity of the MoET. The PSCU also
provided staff for the operation of the education management information system
(EMIS), the information technology support for the MoET, and other core functions.
However, the personnel in the PSCU, who were in some cases paid significantly more
than their public-service colleagues, had a strong interest in preserving their own jobs,
and did little to build capacity in the MoET.

From as early as 2005, and in almost all subsequent missions, the Bank team pointed to
the need to integrate the PSCU functions into the public service, and the risks of sudden
loss of capacity once the project closes. However, as most of the PSCU personnel (all but
the 2 expatriates) were financed through additional government counterpart funds, the
team had little ability to curtail its expansion. The Ministry of Finance and Development
Planning, although opposed to the growth of the PSCU, continued to provide additional
finance in excess of its counterpart obligations to support these personnel.

A mid-term review of the project was held in April 2006. This review noted with
concern the falling net enrollment rate, and the lack of progress on reform of TVET and
higher education. It was agreed that the MoET would undertake a study of the enrollment
patterns to examine the causes of the enrollment patterns. This was subsequently
completed and provided useful analysis and explanation of the patterns. At the time, the
proposed TVET legislation was in draft form and seemed likely to be passed, and the
Council on Higher Education was in the process of being appointed. In both of these
areas, significant progress seemed probable before completion of the project. The
mission also raised concern about the unanticipated growth of the PSCU with both the
MoET and the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MoFDP). The MoFDP
subsequently began to raise questions about the PSCU, and ultimately forced a reduction
of its size through a reduction of the excess counterpart funding.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The choice of project indicators was not ideal. First, the indicators chosen were designed
to monitor progress in the sector as a whole, rather than the impact of the project. While
this may be appropriate in the case of an APL, and in the context of the aim to move
towards a sector wide approach, it resulted in a weak alignment between the indicators
and the focus of the project. In this project, 94% of the resources went to primary and
secondary education. Indicators for progress in ECCD and TVET were questionable,
given the modest resources allocated to these areas. The choice of indicators had a


                                                7

detrimental effect on the project rating, as the project achieved most of its output targets,
and with a more modest set of indicators would have been rated as satisfactory.

Second, the specific indicators of learning achievement were problematic. Learning
achievement does not respond quickly to inputs such as improvements in infrastructure,
and setting targets for learning achievement improvement within the context of a 4-year
project is difficult. The use of national assessment data was also problematic, as the
national assessment was new (supported by the project) and therefore may not have been
completely reliable. Finally, the use of average scores, as opposed to the proportion
reaching a specific competency threshold, was inappropriate, especially in the context of
a reform which increased intake and included a greater cross-section of society.

The monitoring of the education system and the key project indicators progressed well in
the early years of the project. The annual statistical reports were comprehensive and with
the support of the project, the MoET developed improved data collection systems and an
education geographical information system (EGIS) mapping the locations of schools.
Problems of software and capacity emerged in 2007, delaying the publication of 2007 and
2008 statistics. While there were undoubtedly software difficulties, at least part of the
difficulties resulted from the loss of experienced personnel employed through the PSCU.
Despite strong pressure from the supervision team, these difficulties have persisted, and
by April 2009 the MoET had produced only preliminary data for 2007, and no data for
2008.

The information generated as part of the project's Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
framework was helpful to MoET in providing reports for stakeholders including
development partners and the reflection on achievement of indicators and problems
causing lack of achievement generated MoET action to improve participation in some
areas. For example, the EMIS 2006 data on enrolment showed a drop in pupil numbers
and MoET commissioned a study of enrollment trends and revised the plans for
expansion of primary teacher numbers. At the 2008 joint review, National Assessment
data showed a fall in performance in some areas and, in response, MoET organized short
courses for primary teachers aimed at improving the teaching of literacy and numeracy.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Procurement was managed reasonably well after a slow start. An Independent
Procurement Review (IPR) of procurement activities for the ESDP was conducted
between the period July and November 2006 and the report was completed in 2007. The
findings and conclusions for the IPR were that: the processes followed in respect of
procurement and contracting procedures in general were in compliance with procedures
acceptable to the Bank and were in conformity with the legal agreement. In addition, a
fiduciary supervision mission composed of a procurement specialist and a financial
analyst was carried out in August 2008. The mission noted that all the procurement
under the ESDP II Phase 2 (and FTI) had been the subject of Banks prior review
irrespective of amount and the provisions of the Credit [and Grant] agreement
provisions. Consequently the procurement process for relatively small value
procurement which should have been subject to post review by the Bank was taking long



                                               8

and creating unnecessary delays through the addition of additional layers of review by
the Bank when this is not necessary.

In regard to financial management, the fiduciary supervision mission found adequate
capacity in PSCU and observed that external audits were carried out within the six
months allowed (though MoET failed to provide an audit management letter in good time
for the 2007 accounts). The mission identified one major problem with the use of
counterpart funds to pay for expenditures not eligible under the Credit (and FTI funds).
These included the extension of contracts for the Project Coordinator and Procurement
Advisor as well as PSCU gratuities. The mission recommended that counterpart funds
should be used to cover the government portion as established by the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) and to pay for expenditure related to the PDO.

The project was assessed as environment category B. An Environmental and Social
Management Framework and a Resettlement Policy Framework were prepared and
disclosed. However, there was no resettlement of people and no environmental issues
were raised in the course of project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Many of the major components of the project are now part of MoET's ongoing programs
and will continue. All of the schools constructed are in use and sustained through normal
MoET mechanisms. The bursary system developed under the project continues to
provide bursaries for OVCs in secondary schools. The primary textbooks provided
through the project are replenished as required through the school supply unit. It is
anticipated that textbooks for secondary schools can be replaced through the revolving
fund, but this is as yet untested. The Distance Teacher Education Programme (DTEP)
continues to function well, and the MoET has increased the allocation to the Lesotho
College of Education to cover the costs of sustaining its operation.

However, the capacity of the MoET has been diminished by the closure of the project,
with the loss of most of the PSCU personnel. In 2007 the MoET began to create public
service posts to replace some of the tasks performed by PSCU staff, including the NFE
tutors, bursaries officers and the DTEP personnel. Many of the PSCU staff were
absorbed into these posts and became permanent public servants, but others did not have
the academic qualifications required for the posts, and could not be absorbed. The
contracts of the 24 remaining core PSCU staff, those involved in financial management,
procurement and supervision of construction, were extended to March 2009. In March
2009, with support from Irish Aid, these remaining personnel were offered continued
contracts but with salaries matched to public service pay scales, to facilitate absorption
into the public service. While some accepted these posts, there were significant losses of
expertise in all three areas, and procurement and construction have been significantly
disrupted.

It seems likely that there will be a further IDA operation in the education sector in the
coming financial year, but it may be structured as a separate operation, rather than as the
third phase of the ESDP II APL. In parallel the associated FTI operation is continuing
and is currently in its second grant, and in the process of preparation of a third grant.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
Lesotho's development is very dependent on its human resources and the education
system is critical to that. Support across the education sector is relevant and will continue
to be relevant to Lesotho's development. At the time of project design, the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period of 2002-2006 supported the investment
in human development and particularly in education and anticipated an education
operation. In addition, the new CAS developed in 2006 identified: Improving Human
Development Outcomes as one pillar and stated that Bank assistance will be directed
towards improving ... learning outcomes. Focus will be on improving ... the education
sector ... and skill development in the private sector. ...In education, quality, efficiency,
service delivery, and management capacity will be at the center of Bank support. The
CAS also anticipated a new education project, in the form of an operation in support of a
Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) for education in FY09.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The assessment of the outcomes of the project presents a mixed picture, as the project
achieved most of its output targets, but only partly achieved its development objectives.
This section looks at achievement of the PDO and attempts to link critical inputs with
these achievements. Annex 2 provides a summary of progress towards the agreed outputs
under components as described in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). Annex 2 also
comments on these outputs and rates their sustainability.

Objective 1. Increase enrollment and completion in primary education.
The indicators intended to measure this objective were the net enrolment rate (NER) and
the completion rate. The NER was expected to reach 90 percent by project close but was
81 percent in 2007 and the completion rate expected to be 83 percent and was actually 90
percent in 2007. Hence the Development Objective has been partly met, as the
completion rate increased, but NER did not. Analysis of the enrollment patterns reveals
that intake into primary education rose with the introduction of free primary education,
bringing the NER from 60 percent to over 80 percent. As a result of these increases, most
children in Lesotho enroll in school, but many continue to enroll late. In 2006 97 percent
of children of age 12 were enrolled in school although some were in the early grades of
primary education. As a result of the continued late enrollment, particularly in the
mountain areas, the NER has not risen as expected. In fact, NER fell slightly during the
project period, as some of the students in the post-FPE bulge in enrollment moved out of
the official primary school age.

Inputs: construction of classrooms. The project aimed to provide 255 primary
classrooms. In the event the project enabled 243 classrooms to be built. The 243
classrooms increased capacity within the system by an additional 10,000 pupils
accommodated annually and almost all of these are in rural areas and over one-third are
in remote areas. The classrooms were constructed to a high standard, furnished and


                                                10

supported by administration and ablution blocks. A detailed review of the construction
standards during supervision found that the specifications were appropriate given
Lesotho's climate and soil conditions, and the high cost of repair (particularly in the
remote schools).

Costs of construction were relatively high by regional standards, with an average cost per
primary school of US$227,000. Costs were higher in the most remote areas, where the
contractors factored in a higher cost of delivery of materials and in some cases the cost of
some works to make the site accessible to vehicles. Given the standard of construction,
the cost of materials and transport and the proportion of schools in mountain areas, these
costs were justified, and were broadly in line with the appraisal estimates.

The project also supported a community driven approach to construction. Three
communities were selected and each community identified labor providers while the
PSCU purchased the materials and delivered them as required. There were mixed results,
with one school completed, one school abandoned and one school requiring further
interventions by the PSCU to complete the work. This experiment was not evaluated.
Delegated construction is more likely to be successful where the output is additional
classrooms in existing schools and the work is overseen by the school board (including
the community).

Input: Provision of bursaries to needy children. The project aimed to award bursaries to
15,000 pupils unable to attend schools because of lack of resources. Bursaries were
intended to cover cost of fees, textbooks and feeding and averaged 2,600 Maloti per child
in 2006. School principals identified needy orphans and bursaries officers verified and
prioritized. In all over 20,000 bursaries were provided. In addition, the project supported
salaries of 10 district and 3 central staff as well as training. Expenditure on primary
bursaries was lower than expected, partly because of interventions from other donors, and
partly because of reducing demand for primary bursaries as primary school fees were
abolished. On completion of FPE rollout to all standards in 2006, bursaries for primary
were provided only for special needs children. Given the number of single and double
orphans in Lesotho, the provision of bursaries is an important intervention and
supervision missions reported satisfaction with the administration of the scheme.
However, no evaluation of modalities or impact was carried out.

While improvements in classroom infrastructure and provision of bursaries are both
likely to have contributed to increased enrolment and retention in primary schools, it is
difficult to isolate the effect of these from the other major factors influencing the system,
and particularly the impact of FPE. FPE was introduced on a phased basis one year at a
time, with Standard 1 free in 2000, and all grades 1 to seven free from 2006. Primary
enrollment rose rapidly following the introduction of FPE, and the Gross Enrollment Rate
(GER) reached 128 in 2004. This rise was driven by very high intake rates. In 2000, the
first year of FPE, the number of new entrants into Standard 1 was double the age cohort.
In subsequent years the intake reduced, and fell steadily to 121% of the age cohort by
2007.




                                               11

The bulge of extra large classes moving up through the system has driven the changes in
key indicators. Gross Enrolment Rate rose to 128% of the school age cohort by 2004, and
then began to decline slowly as the extra large classes in the FPE bulge were eroded by
high dropout. The NER also rose with the introduction of FPE increasing from 60% in
1999 to 82% in 2000. However the NER did not rise further as expected, as many
children continued to start school late. Between 2003 and 2007 the NER actually fell
slightly, as the bulge of enrolment resulting from FPE gradually grew older than the
expected age for primary school children.

Objective 2: Improve learning achievement in primary education. The indicator
chosen for monitoring learning gains was the average scores on the national assessment
test, administered every two years to a sample of students at standards 3 and 6. In the
2006 assessment (the latest available) the scores in mathematics exceeded the target
values, but scores in English fell below the target, and scores in Sesotho met the target
only in Standard 6. Accordingly, this DO was partially met.

There are a number of difficulties with this indicator. First, the 2004 national assessment
was the first national assessment, following a pilot in 2003. The results, showing a
decline in all subjects between 2004 and 2006, seem inconsistent with the increasing pass
rate in the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), raising questions about the
validity of tests. Second, the use of average scores, rather than the percentage of children
reaching a minimum standard may also have been unwise, as the expansion of enrollment
might be expected to draw in a broader cross section of the population and thus reduce
average scores. Third, the switch to Sesotho as the language of instruction in the early
grades may have causes some disruption in the system, and resulted in a temporary drop
in quality in Sesotho and English.


                                                12

Overall the picture of learning performance is unclear for the moment. The 2008 national
assessment data, when available, is expected to clarify some of the issues. In addition,
the World Bank Development Research Group (DECRG) is currently conducting a study
of the changes in learning achievement since the introduction of FPE, based on EMIS,
PLSE and National Assessment data, which is expected to shed more light on these
issues.

The project supported a range of inputs intended to improve quality: textbooks for core
subjects, in-service training and upgrading qualifications through a distance teacher
program.

Inputs: Textbooks for primary schools. The project intended to provide core textbooks to
maintain the pupil to textbook ratio at 5. Initially, it was intended that the project provide
mathematics textbooks in Sesotho for Standards 2 and 3. However, no suitable textbooks
were found. In agreement with MoET, the project provided over 60,000 textbooks in
different subjects and textbooks were purchased and distributed and are in use in schools.

Inputs: Annual in-service training for all teachers. The project supported a needs
assessment for primary teachers carried out by the Lesotho College of Education (LCE)
in 2007, as well as curriculum and training modules based on these and supported
training some inspectors, advisors as well as National Curriculum Development Centre
(NCDC) and LCE staff to carry out training for teachers of mathematics, science, Sesotho
and English. The project provided resources for much of this with some training of
trainers for mathematics and science courses supported by the Support for Mathematics
and Science in Secondary Education project (SMASSE). 2,000 English teachers were
trained in 2007 and 1,777 teachers of mathematics and science were trained in 2008.
Teachers of Sesotho will be trained during 2009. It is intended to continue this training
on an annual basis. The development of the training modules and support for senior
MoET staff should ensure that the training can continue to be provided.

Inputs: Upgrading for serving unqualified teachers. DTEP is a 4-year program for
unqualified and under-qualified teachers. The teachers enroll and are provided with self-
instructional materials, attend monthly weekend workshops and six monthly residential
courses in LCE during school holidays. Teachers study for four years and take
examinations equivalent to those on the whole-time course at LCE. Following on
interventions in ESDP II Phase 1, support was provided to complete the development of
modules. Self-instructional modules for all subjects and all four years of the course were
designed, produced and distributed to DTEP students. In addition, the project provided
support for the operating costs of weekend workshops and residential courses, and the
office equipment. The DTEP has been remarkably successful: graduating 447 teachers in
2006, 316 in 2007 and 437 in 2008. Of the 1,194 graduating, 889 (74 percent) are
female. There are over 2,216 teachers on the course in 2009 of whom 75 percent are
female. The success of the DTEP is particularly important as the current output of the
regular LCE course is insufficient and the proportion of unqualified teachers has been
growing. The DTEP also provides a mechanism where unqualified teachers, often



                                             13

recruited locally, are able to obtain a qualification, thus assisting in the provision of
qualified teachers in remote areas. An evaluation of this program was recommended
during the mid-term review but this was not taken up and remains desirable.

Inputs: Other. Other components that contributed to the achievement of this objective
were the support for district management, support for curriculum and exams and staff
development and training. These are described further under Objective 4 below.
As measured by the achievement tests the objective to improve learning achievement in
primary was partly achieved. While other measures of quality, including repetition rates
and dropout also give cause for concern, it seems likely that the inputs supported by the
project will improve quality over time.

Objective 3: Increase enrollment in secondary education. This development objective
was achieved. The indicator was the GER, which was expected to rise from 43 percent in
2002 to 50 percent by 2007. In practice the GER rose to 53 percent, and actual numbers
enrolled increased from 80,000 in 2002 to 100,000 in 2007. The project design supported
the following activities: (a) construction of 3 secondary schools offering lower secondary
education (Forms A, B and C) and (b) provision of bursaries. In addition, textbooks were
to be provided and a revolving fund was to be established and 125 secondary school
principals and 30 school boards, 20 secondary inspectors and advisors and 1000 teachers
were to be provided with training.

Inputs: Construction of schools. In regard to enrollment increase, the three secondary
schools were built and they accommodate an additional 720 students annually (at 40
students per class). These schools are constructed to a high standard with six classrooms,
administration, science and ablutions blocks as well as two teachers' houses. They are
also located in the more remote districts serving areas not otherwise served. The Bank's
supervision team examined the sites proposed for construction and assessed technical
suitability and presence of feeder schools. On the basis of these assessments, some sites
were rejected and the final sites agreed. All three schools were provided with furniture.
The costs were relatively high at an average of US$600,000 per school. However, the
costs and specifications were judged by the technical experts to be appropriate for the
conditions. All three schools are currently in operation, and some are over-enrolled. At
least one of the secondary schools has already built additional classrooms to
accommodate Forms D and E.

Inputs: Provision of bursaries. Bursaries were provided supporting 15,000 students
annually. While the project supported identified students at Forms A, B and C, the
Global Fund supported students at Forms D and E. Bursaries covered the cost of fees
(which range from 800 Maloti to 6,000 Maloti annually), textbooks and feeding. These
bursary programs are continuing with support from government and other donors.

Inputs: Provision of textbooks. At the request of the Government, the project reallocated
funds from primary school construction to provide support for textbooks in all subjects
for Forms A, B and C for over 70,000 students. The Bank supervision team was
instrumental in assisting the MoET to establish a revolving fund to finance sustained



                                               14

textbook provision. This fund is intended to allow for replacement of a full set of
textbooks after a five-year usage period. Funds collected for textbook fees are paid by
schools into a special consolidated account. To date there has been no call on this
account, and it is unclear how much of the required funds have been collected.

Inputs: School-level training. Support was provided to develop a manual for school
boards in secondary schools. A self-instructional training manual was developed with
project support and is with all school principals.

Objective 4: Build capacity in the education sector, including for ECCD, TVET,
higher education, Non-Formal Education, and MoET core functions. The targets in
these two areas were not met. The indicator of ECCD coverage increased from 31
percent in 2002 to 36 percent in 2007 against a project target of 40 percent. The TVET
indicator of an adequate legal and regulatory framework conducive to a demand-driven
TVET system in place could not be considered achieved as the revised legislation had not
passed.

ECCD. While the target for ECCD coverage was not achieved, there were gains. Home-
based ECCD centers, using volunteer staff, were established in all districts. However a
number ceased to operate after an initial period and it is estimated that 59 of the 71
centers established by 2007 continue to operate in 2008. The project supported the costs
of establishing these home-based centers. In parallel, MoET has been establishing pilot
reception classes in primary schools, though sometimes in temporary spaces (staff rooms
or store rooms). Eleven were operating in 2006, 97 in 2007 and 123 were operating in
2008. These cater for children of age 5 only, and teachers are paid the General Minimum
Wage as defined by the Labour Court. Support was provided for the development of a
syllabus and training materials for ECCD teachers, and a certificate course (2 years part
time) has now been established at LCE. Thirty-two reception class teachers are
completing the second year of this course and a further 30 enrolled late in 2008.

TVET. The target for reform of TVET was not achieved during the project. Reforms
expected included the imposition of a training levy on industry, involvement of industry
in the management of TVET and restructuring of the structures and staffing of the sub-
sector to align with industry requirements. There was considerable resistance to these
reforms: the training levy was not welcomed by the private sector, and the proposed
reforms were perceived as a threat by some of the staff in the sub-sector. As a result, the
reforms did not occur as quickly as anticipated, and opposition from industry and the
sector resulted in repeated re-drafting of the proposed legislation. At the time of the mid-
term review, the TVET Bill had been finalized and was ready for presentation to
parliament, and its passage seemed probable. However the progress of the Bill was
delayed by competing national priorities and then disrupted as the government fell. With
the elections, a new Minister of Education and Training was appointed, and at the close
of the project the government was further revising the Bill, removing the proposed
training levy, and revising the management structures intended for TVET. There appears
to be a commitment to reform in the sub-sector, and the Bill is scheduled for a further
presentation to Parliament in 2009.

Higher education. A Higher Education Act was passed in 2004, which provided for the
establishment of the Council for Higher Education. The project provided limited inputs
to the sub-sector, mainly in providing support for a study tour of three African countries
by some higher education policymakers in 2007. The new Council for Higher Education
was not established until 2008 and the associated secretariat had not been established at
the close of the project. The project also supported development of a framework for an
incentive fund but further work on this is awaiting the establishment of the secretariat.

NFE. The project aimed to support the work of Lesotho Distance Teaching Centre
(LDTC) on adult literacy in two districts and paid the salaries of 20 literacy resource
teachers. These worked with Learning Post Advisors (literacy teachers at village level).
The project also supported training workshops for these. In addition, the project paid for
the production of basic English materials as well as materials to help LDTC train
villagers in income-generating activities. The 20 NFE teachers were employed through
the PSCU, and their contracts terminated in September 2008. Those who met minimum
qualifications were absorbed into the MoET and 15 new public service positions were
created. The NFE work has not been evaluated and it is difficult to judge impact.

Capacity in MoET. It was expected that a plan for training across the whole of MoET
would be developed. The project helped to build capacity in some areas of MoET: three
staff of the Planning Directorate were supported on the nine month planning course in the
International Institute of Education Planning; procurement and financial management
staff in PSCU were provided with training; and bursaries officers and inspectors and
advisors were also supported. MoET has now strengthened its Human Resources
Department and a cross-Ministry plan has been developed, including integration of PSCU
functions into MoET.

Curriculum and Assessment. The project provided support to assist consultations on
an integrated curriculum and assessment framework and its production. The Framework
was approved by Cabinet in 2008 and the Examinations Council of Lesotho (ECOL) and
NCDC are now under a Chief Education Officer (CEO) for Curriculum and Assessment.
The project also provided support to help ECOL localize the Cambridge examinations.
However, this is moving slowly and further support is needed to help the transition.
Considerable support was provided to build capacity for national assessment (NA). The
project supported participation by key personnel from Lesotho in five World Bank
organized courses aimed at providing skills in support of national assessment. A pilot
and three full assessments have now been carried out and reports provided on three of
these. This is a major achievement but will require continued capacity building in data
analysis and report writing as well as some hardware and software if the work is to
continue to produce high quality information.

HIV/AIDS: The project supported a HIV coordinator and two counselors located at HQ.
The project also supported training as HIV counselors for 57 MoET officials and 367
teachers. Supported by MoET, clinics have been established in the higher education
institutions to serve the high student populations. In addition, voluntary testing of



                                             16

education sector staff has been introduced in 7 districts: 2,585 were tested, of whom 528
were HIV positive. As the project came to a close the coordinator and one of the
counselors left the MoET, and their functions have been assigned to regular MoET staff.

The development objective for capacity building was only partly achieved, there was
progress in ECCD and on HIV/AIDS and MoET staff, particularly in planning and
assessment were provided with training, but overall the MoET continued to have capacity
difficulties and became over-reliant on PSCU personnel.

3.3 Efficiency
Net present value and the economic rate of return have not been calculated. The project
was implemented efficiently and the input cost estimates at appraisal were accurate.
While the project was extended for one year to accommodate some staff training and
delivery of furniture to schools the main activities were completed on time. As
discussed, there was a planned change to provide textbooks to secondary education
students.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
This project financed relevant and important improvements in primary and secondary
education in Lesotho. It largely achieved its output targets, exceeded some, and was
virtually fully disbursed by closure. However if cannot be considered completely
satisfactory because it failed to achieve some of the development objectives. Throughout
the project, the passage of the legislation reforming TVET seemed to be imminent and
the team rated the progress as satisfactory. As the project drew to a close, it became
apparent that the legislation would not pass on time, and that the ECCD target would not
be met, and consequently the project was downgraded to moderately satisfactory in the
final ISR.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Government's introduction of FPE and the project's support for this are likely to increase
access for poor children in Lesotho. In addition, school construction supported by the
project provided schools in remote locations where service was limited. Finally,
bursaries for orphans improve their opportunities to participate in school. However, in
the absence of evaluation and data it is not possible to describe the impact precisely.

The DTEP is notable in providing opportunities for the unqualified teachers, often locally
recruited, to upgrade their skills. This contributes to improving the distribution of
qualified teachers in primary schools, and provides opportunities for young people with
poor school leaving qualifications to upgrade their skills. In doing so it may also provide
greater opportunities for social mobility, although this is yet to be studied.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
MoET has been strengthened by the development of the DTEP, introduction of a national
assessment, the development of the Curriculum and Assessment Framework, the



                                              17

development of a robust bursary scheme, the capacity building for school principals and
board of management, and the development of a syllabus for ECCD.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
PSCU staff were instrumental in assisting GOL to receive two FTI grants and they also
supported MoET in organizing annual reviews of progress in education.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
None were held.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The risk is moderate. When Operating Costs are excluded, 94 percent of project costs
were devoted to primary and secondary education. Many of the supports provided
through construction of classrooms, training courses design, capacity enhancement,
development of a curriculum and assessment framework and the development and
operation of the DTEP will continue to make a contribution to the delivery of primary
and secondary education and it is likely that MoET will continue to support these. There
is a high risk that the achievement of sustainable strategies for TVET will not be
achieved. On the other hand, work on higher education is proceeding though slowly and
there has been success in integrating HIV/AIDS awareness into curricula.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
As has been noted, Bank staff worked closely with MoET in project design and there was
considerable ownership of the project by MoET line units. In addition, Bank staff
responded to MoET requests to support the whole sector. While this imposed particular
difficulties, it was the correct decision. However there should have been more discussion
of the breadth of project support and the indicators chosen were not ideal.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
Twelve supervision missions were held over the life of the project and these focused on
the achievement of project objectives and ensured that Government did not allow other
priorities to interfere. Each mission's Aide Memoire identified the issues clearly as well
as the actions to be taken. Given the importance of construction it is notable that a
professional architectural/engineering firm was included in more than half the
supervision missions. The project had three task team leaders (TTL), the project design
TTL (who was Washington-based) until April 2006, a South Africa based TTL from
April 2006 to June 2007 and a Washington-based TTL until project close in end 2008
(and through the ICR). Of particular note are the later Aide Memoires that summarized
progress on agreed actions in the previous mission and identified others to be taken
before the next mission. The ISRs were completed on time and the advice from


                                             18

management was helpful. The issue of the un-planned growth of the PSCU was
highlighted during supervision consistently, and was raised with the MoFDP at the mid-
term review. The team was proactive in addressing this issue and sought advice from the
financial management and legal departments as soon as the relevant information became
available. While it could be argued that the indicators might have changed at the mid-
term review, there was progress on TVET and higher education at that time and the risk
to achievement of targets did not appear high.

Also of note is the Bank's willingness to assist the Government to access FTI funds to
support the sector. In addition, the team supported MoET to prepare for sector-wide
reviews with other partners and to refine the sector plan. These additional tasks were
demanding and imposed considerable work pressure on supervision staff. They did,
however, enable staff to maintain the coherence of sector-wide support. Given the focus
on primary and secondary, there was limited attention paid to TVET and Higher
Education. One particular problem was delayed disbursement caused by the Bank's
requirement for prior review of all procurement in the first eighteen months. This was
not required by the DCA and unnecessarily delayed disbursement.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The project design was based on experience with the first phase of the Education Sector
Development Project, and a series of analytic studies. The design was comprehensive and
included analysis of the needs of the entire sector. The limited implementation capacity
of the MoET was recognized at the start, and mitigation measures put in place, including
the provision of two long term expatriate technical assistants supported by the project.
Supervision was conducted systematically, and issues were identified early and
consistently and brought to the attention of the client.

With hindsight, the comprehensive project design stretched the limited implementation
capacity of the MoET, leading to neglect of some of the smaller sub-components. The
increasing influence of the PSCU, emerging from a unit with a strong procurement and
civil works civil works background, contributed to the neglect of the sub-components
unrelated to civil works and major procurement items. Pressure from the team during
supervision assisted in drawing attention to some of the neglected sub-components, and
highlighted the issue of the growing dependence on an unsustainable PSCU.

During supervision the Bank team contributed to the sector dialogue, prepared a country
status report for the sector, supported the development of joint reviews, conducted and
supported studies and analytic work including studies of teacher issues, enrollment
patterns, and education expenditure. The Bank team worked closely with the other donors
active in the sector, was instrumental in securing FTI funding, and acted as supervising
entity for the FTI catalytic fund grant.


5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory


                                             19

Senior management personnel in the MoET were actively engaged with the project, were
very familiar with its objectives and operation, and met regularly with supervision
missions. However, the MoET was not proactive in regard to a number of areas,
including absorption of PSCU functions (and necessary staff) into the Ministry, or in
active involvement in facilitating TVET and higher education reforms. The lack of
attention given to reforms in TVET and Higher education contributed to the limited
progress in these sub-sectors. The failure to build capacity within the MoET, and the
increased use of the PSCU as a flexible source of staffing, resulted in over-dependence,
lowered morale in the MoET and had detrimental long term impacts on MoET capacity.
In mitigation, it must be recognized that this project occurred at a time of expansion in
primary and secondary education, with strong public pressure for expanded access and
improved facilities at primary schools, which put pressure on the small MoET staff to
focus on these sub-sectors.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
In principle, the implementing agency was the MoET, and specifically the Planning Unit
of the MoET. In reality the PSCU became the de facto implementing agency, leading to
institutional capacity difficulties at the closure of the project. The PSCU performed
effectively as an implementing agency, and its performance enabled the construction of
243 primary classrooms and ancillary facilities, and 3 secondary schools, and supplied
furniture and equipment for these. It also enabled the procurement of 60,000 primary
textbooks, secondary textbooks and was focused on the PDO. They also provided
support for bursaries for over 20,000 pupils and students. In addition, the PSCU
supported the successful distance teacher education program as well as a range of
activities that covered most of the MoET units.

The PSCU, however, failed to build capacity within the MoET, and instead absorbed
additional responsibilities, increasing the dependence on it as a unit. As the project drew
to a close, the performance of some parts of the PSCU deteriorated, progress reports
became less comprehensive and the follow up on implementation issues less thorough.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
Overall the borrower performance was mixed. The project was implemented successfully
and with only a one-year extension. Construction and procurement targets were met, and
civil works were supervised and built to a high standard. There were no unresolved
procurement or financial management issues at the end of the project. However, the
borrower did not manage the implementation as expected, and instead became reliant on
a large and expensive PSCU. Further, the MoET did not succeed in implementing the
policy changes expected during the life of the project, including (i) reform of the TVET
sub-sector, (ii) reform of the funding of higher education, and (iii) adjusting the budget
composition to increase the share devoted to primary and secondary education.



6. Lessons Learned


                                               20

Use of implementation arrangements outside of the public service structures created
difficulties of sustainability. Despite the intentions at appraisal, the PSCU became the de
facto implementing agency for the project and for other MoET functions. Once
established, it was allowed to grow rapidly. While effective in implementing the core
tasks, the PSCU did little to build capacity within the ministry. In fact, any failures in the
ministry were seen as strengthening the case for continuation of the PSCU. The
reluctance to address this issue on time, and to develop a realistic transition strategy, has
resulted in a much more abrupt transition than would otherwise have been the case, with
consequent disruption to the work of the MoET. Building capacity within the MoET
remains a challenge. Provision of training courses has had some impact, but the benefits
were eroded by staff turnover and by organizational structures which prevented optimal
use of the skilled personnel. Building better organizational structures is likely to take
some time, and some external assistance may be required to ensure efficient operation of
the MoET. However, future external assistance should be carefully managed to ensure
that it supports capacity building aims and cannot become a separate arm of the Ministry.

The broad scope of the project put some of the smaller components at risk. The project
design covered many aspects of the sector, and included a large number of small
components with limited funding. In the context of a ministry with limited capacity, and
a PSCU focused on construction and large procurement items, there was little support for
some of the minor components. In retrospect, the project design may have been too
complex, and a simplified design with fewer components, might have been implemented
more fully.

Some of the project components would have benefitted from a rigorous evaluation. This
project included a number of innovations, including the Distance Teacher Education
Programme (DTEP), the Home Based ECCD centers, the textbook revolving fund and the
bursary scheme. In each case a rigorous evaluation could have assisted the MoET to
refine the intervention and improve impact. A number of evaluations were planned but
did not take place.

Structural reform is unlikely to be influenced by the project if it has little direct
contribution to the relevant sub-sector. This project anticipated significant reform in
TVET and Higher education, when the project was making very minor interventions in
these areas and thus had little leverage to influence reform.

The reform of the TVET sub-sector remains challenging. It is clear that the current
provision is poorly matched to the national needs, and that provision of skills training is
an important contributor to sustained economic growth. The reforms envisaged in the
project design, including a training levy to be imposed on employers, and plans to
radically reshape the provision of TVET, seem likely to meet continued resistance from
employers and the current TVET staff. It may have been unwise to propose a training
levy in advance of demonstrable benefits to industry. The passing of legislation is
unlikely to be the key driver of reform. There are some indications of promising
directions for the TVET sub-sector. First, a pilot project offering training in partnership



                                              21

with industry, where the training is designed as a relatively short course specifically
tailored to industry needs, is proving successful in attracting students, and helping them
transition to employment. Second, a private higher education institute which recently
opened a campus in Maseru offering courses in information technology, has
demonstrated that there is strong demand for certificate and diploma level courses in
areas that are perceived as labor-market relevant. Future development in the sub-sector
will need to consider both the labor market needs, and the political economy of reform.

The Distance Teacher Education Program is a promising model for countries with a
shortage of qualified teachers. This training modality, combined with Lesotho's teacher
recruitment practices, allowed schools in mountain areas to recruit unqualified teachers,
often from the local area, and provide them with the opportunity to train in situ. This has
assisted in provision of teachers in remote areas, and in building capacity within
mountain communities.

Selection of appropriate indicators is critical. In designing projects there is a tension
between the need to monitor the higher level objectives, and the need to identify
indicators which are likely to respond to the project interventions within the project
timeframe. Monitoring of student learning achievement is particularly problematic as it
is slow to change, and unlikely to respond to project inputs during the project life. In this
project the selection of indicators more closely match to the project interventions could
have resulted in an overall rating of satisfactory.

Education service provision in Lesotho is made more difficult by the geography of the
country, including the low population density, transport difficulties and severe climate in
mountain areas. Poor transport infrastructure and severe climate limit the effective
catchment area of schools, while low population density implies low student numbers
within catchment areas, resulting in small and less efficient schools. The disparity in
living conditions between remote mountain areas and the lowlands makes provision of
qualified teachers in remote mountain schools difficult. These geographical difficulties
result in late entry to primary schools, as children are seen as too small to walk the
distances to school.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
The borrower comments, summarized in annex 7, reflect the poor communication
between the PSCU and the MoET managers. As a result, some activities were delayed
because of a perceived lack of funds, and rushed implementation at a later date. The
strong ownership of the project by the PSCU impeded government ownership, and
resulted in some activities being perceived as project-driven.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

This summary was prepared by the task team, as the borrower produced a 27 page
completion report and no summary was provided.

The completion report described the project objectives and the progress under each
objective by December 2008. It highlighted a number of issues and challenges which
arose during the project:

   a) The borrower noted (section 1.7) that lack of concrete information about the
       availability of funds delayed the implementation of some activities, and resulted
       in rushed implementation later. The report suggested that the planning unit
       should provide regular reports on the status of funds available to the MoET
       managers.

   b) The borrower noted (section 3.1) that some of the activities supported by the
       project were not sustained after the period of funding. The example cited was the
       support for the home-based care centers, where it was reported that the training of
       care-givers and communities was not sustained after the closure of the project.
       The report suggested that the project should be resuscitated in order to provide
       sustained support.

   c) The borrower noted (section 3.4) that the support of learning resource teachers
       had boosted morale in the NFE literacy programs, but that this support, and the
       associated morale, collapsed when the project ended. The report suggested that
       that better plans should have been in place for government to take over these tasks
       when the project ended.

   d) The borrower also noted that (section 3.2), as a result of the short term nature of
       projects, they tend to receive a focus of attention, sometimes to the detriment of
       other non-project activities.

   e) The borrower noted that the project indicators were not well matched with the
       project inputs, and suggested that the chosen indicators should have focused more
       closely on primary and secondary education, as these were the focus of the bulk
       of the project resources.

The borrower report did not suggest overall ratings.
