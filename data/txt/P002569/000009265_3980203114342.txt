PREFACE
This Project Completion Report concerns the Technical Assistance
Project I in Sudan, for which Credit 614-SU in the amount of US$4 million
was approved in February 1976. The Credit has been closed on March 31,
1982; US$3.7 million have been disbursed.
The Completion Report and Highlights have been prepared by the
Eastern Africa Regional Office of the Bank. It is based on inforsmation
gathered in the course of supervision of this project and of the Second
Technical Assistance Credit (No. 1153-SU), on a review of the relevant Bank
files and reports, and on the comments of Government and Bank staff who
have been associated with the project. Comments received from the Kuwait
Fund and the UNDP are reproduced as Annexes IV and V.
This project was not audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUDAN - TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(CREDIT 614-SU)
HIGHLIGHTS
The Technical Assistance Project I, cofinanced by the Kuwait Fund,
responded to the need for more carefully prepared project proposals, which
became apparent after Sudan embarked on a major expansion of its public
investment program. Sudan had established ambitious investment goals
particularly for large capital-intensive investments in industry,
infrastructure, and modern sector agriculture and needed to expand its
capacity to identify projects for financing and to strengthen its ability
to manage the preinvestment work.
In mid-1975 the Bank Group began discussing with Government the
possibility of a special technical assistance credit to facilitate project
preparation and to help train Sudanese staff in project preparation.  The
project was appraised in November 1975 and was approved by the Bank in
February 1976. The Kuwait Fund agreed to cofinance US$ 3.0 million of the
US$ 8.0 million project cost. A second Technical Assistance Project
was approved by the Board of Directors on May 28, 1981 and became effective
on December 22, 1981.
The Project was carried out largely as anticipated, although with
considerable delay. The original closing date of December 31, 1979 was
extended to March 31, 1982; at the original closing date only 35% of the
total project funds were disbursed; no disbursements were made during the
first year of project implementation. The Project Preparation Unit (PPU)
suffered from h4tgh staff turnover among the professional staff and lacked
adequate support services. The Project Review Committee (PRC) responsible
for the selection of studies to be financed under the Credit was, at
times, more of an administrative bottleneck than a guiding and
decision-making body. Institutional performance did, however, improve
considerably in the course of implementation. The PPU continues to
function under the second Technical Assistance Project, while the PRC has
been dissolved with the closing of Credit 614-SU.
Of the 11 separate studies financed under the project, three have
led to projects apprcved by the Bank Group. two studies served as basis for
projets presently beLng prepared or appra4 ed and one study provided the
background information for the accounting component of the Technical
As6istance II Project.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUDAN - TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(CREDIT 614-SU)
I.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
1.      The first Technical Assistance Project in Sudan was conceived at a
ti-me when the economic/financial outlook for the country seemed quite
buoyant.  Sudan was regarded in the early to mid-1970's as the potential
"bread basket" of the middle east; indeed, after the surge of oil price
increases in 1973, many of Sudan's oil-exporting neighbors looked on the
country's substantial but largely unexploited agricultural resources as an
attractive target for investment. Even though at the time Sudan was
experiencing debt and balance of payment difficulties, these were felt to
be of a temporary nature. In the circumstances, the Government found it
possible to embark on a major expansion of public sector investment in 1973
and 1974. This expansion, however, took place in an unsystematic manner
since Sudan at the time had no planning document; rather it occurred within
the general objectives contained in an Interim Action Program adopted by
the leadership of the Sudan Socialist Union in 1973. Preparatory work had
begun on a six-year plan, however, and it was to have been finalized in
July, 1977. In the meantime, Government's limited project preparation
capacity was perceived to be a potentially serious constraint particuarly
in view of the high level of public investments being contemplated by
Government and endorsed by such studies as the Sudan report prepared by
ILO.
2.      In mid-1975 the Bank Group began discussing with Government the
possibility of a special technical assistance credit to facilitate project
preparation and to help train Sudanese staff in project preparation. A
companion objective was to help avoid duplication of efforts by external
financing agencies since at the time there was no lack of investment
proposals and ideas for Sudan. The Bank's approach was based to some
extent on a similar project that had been approved earlier for Indonesia;
the aim was to promote a fairly narrowly defined activity concerned solely
with taking the priorities identified by the government, and such studies
as were already available, and identifying and financing the work required
to prepare the projects for financing.
3.      The Bank's ideas were discussed with Government, endorsed verbally
by the Minister of Finance in August, 1975, and finalized at the 1975
Annual Meetings. Appraisal was carried out in November, 1975, negotiations
in January, 1976; the Board approved a US$4.0 million Credit on cebruary
17, 1976 and the project became effective on October 5, 1976. The Kuwait
Fund, which did not participate in the early discussions or the appraieal,
agreed to cofinance the endeavor with a loan of US$3.0 million equivalent.
The European Community, which had at one time expressed an interest in
possible cofinancing, decided not to participate.
4.      A Project Preparation Unit (PPU) was established in the MiniL:ry of
National Planning to implement the project and a Project Review Committee
(PRC) was established to provide overall supervision. Although the



-2-
feasibility and project preparation studies were carried out largely as
expected, the institutional side of the exercise did not evolve as
originally planned. The PPU, for most of the implementation period
temained a kind of appanidage to the Ministry and was not given appropriate
emphasis until late in the implementation period, and then only under
pressure of conditionality associated with the second project (Credit
1153-SU). The PRC started out strongly but aDpeared to lose interest as
time went on, met only intermittently and has been disbanded for the second
project. It remained a body too removed and inflexible and had only
limited impact in the actual selection process for studies to be financed.
5.      Although delayed considerably, the Project helped markedly in
improving preparatior, capacity, in the actual preparationi of projects and
in establishing improved institutional structures and procedures for
project preparation.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
6.      The first Technical Assistance Project responded to the need for
more carefully prepared project proposals, which became apparent after the
Sudan embarked on a major expansion of public investments, which rose from
U.S. $75 million in 1972/73 to U.S. $100 million in 1973/74 and exceeded
U.S. $250 million in 1974/75. The necessity to further increase public
investments was pointed out by the "Comprehensive Employment Strategy
Report" submitted by the International Labour Organization and prepared
together with the Bank. The report included recommendations for a high
growth strategy, calling for additional public investments in agriculture
and infrastructure. A tripling of gross capital inflows was projected
until 1985, rising to about U.S. $1 billion.
7.      The increased public investment program was a response to changes
in the political and economic environment of the Sudan and in the
neighboring Gulf States.  Four developments in the past 1971 period gave
rise to optimism concerning Sudan's growth prospects. First, the civil war
in the south came to an end with the signing of the peace accord in Addis
Ababa in 1972. Second, the emergence of the Sudan Socialist Union (SSU),
appeared to offer prospects of a more broad based and authoritative
national program than had characterized Sudan in the past. Third, the
expectation was that Sudan could supply the rich markets of the Middle East
with agricultural products and tap the pool of surplus funds in the
oil-producing Arab countries. The 1973/74 oil price increases strengthened
this vision of Sudan as the "breadbasket" of the Arab world. Fourth,
considerable inflow of Arab capital from oil-exporting countries was
expected, which would support the rapid development program to be launched.
8.      These apparent prospects encouraged the Sudan Government to
undertake large capital-intensive investments in industry, infrastructure,
and modern sector agriculture. The aim was to expand the country's
transportation system, to achieve self-sufficiency in a number of basic
consumer products and to increase the production of high-value cash crops,
particularly for exports. To support the ambitious investment goals, the
Sudan needed to expand its capacity to identify projects for financing and



-3 -
to strengthen its ability to manage the preinvestment work. Some project
identification and preparation work had already been undertaken by the
Government, by various U.N. agencies, by bilateral agencies and under IDA
financed arrangements, but the level of preparation activities proved to be
insufficient and the absence of a sufficient pipeline of adequately
prepared projects had become a major barrier to a further expansion of
investmlents.
9.      The objective of the Technical Assistance Credi.t. was to finance a
program of project preparation studies for the Sudanese Government and to
assist in expanding the capacity of Sudanese institutions to execute
preinvestment work. Studies to be finranced would have to be in high
priority sectors and closely linked to an anticipated investment decision.
Examples mentioned as high priorities were railways and irrigation
rehabilitation.  The President's Report did not define any specific
studies, which should be financed under the Credit.
10.     Negotiations for the project were held January 5-7, 1976, Board
apprc'val was obtained on February 17, 1976; the date of effectiveness was
October 5, 1976. The Project was co-financed with 13S. $3 million by the
Kuwait Fund, while the European Economic Community, which originally was
interested in cofinancing part of the project under the Lome Agreement,
decided not to participate.
11.     It was agreed that the Project would be administered by the Project
Preparation Unit (PPU) to be established in the National Planning
Commission (NPC). Location of PPU within the NPC was not undisputed,
arguments were brought forward to locate separate project preparation units
in each sector ministry rather than on the general level of the NPC. To
secure sufficient participation of the relevant ministries and to provide
for integration of the various agencies involved, the PPU was to organize
informal working parties, composed of representatives of Government
agencies concerned, to consider each sub-project.  Approval was to be
required for each sub-project by a Project Review Committee (PRC), which
included the Director General of the National Planning Commission, the
Resident Representatives of UNDP and IBRD, a representative of the Kuwait
Fund and such other members as found to be appropriate. It was agreed that
contracts exceeding U.S. $100,000 in value should be subject to prior
approval of IDA.
L
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
12.     The studies carried out under the Credit have prepared a variety of
projects in Sudan which are now being implemented or under further
preparation. Of the 11 separate studies financed under the Project (Annex
I), three have led to projects approved by the Bank Group: the New Halfa
Irrigation Project (Credit 1022-SU), the Livestock Meat Marketing Project
(Credit 782-SU), and the Agricultural Services Project (Credit 1201-SU).
Based on the Gezira preparation study, the Gezira Modernization and
Irrigation Project was appraised in May '82. The Sugar Rehabilitation
Study has provided the groundwork for further project preparation work.



-4-
The Accounting Study provided the basis for the accounting component of the
Technical Assistance II Project.
13.     Cofinancing arrangements with the K1uwait Fund have worked very
well. Studies were generally financed separately either by the Kuwait Fund
or by IDA, with the exception of the Gezira preparation study, which was
financed jointly.  The Kuwait Fund financed feasibility studies for
projects in the Transportation, Energy, Water Supply artd Agricultural
Sectors. 1/
14.     The Project provided funds for a variety of short traininlg courses
in Western Europe in the fields of agriculture, industry, and
agro-Industry. Several staff members of the PPU attended these courses;
US$ 82,000 was disbursed for this purpose.
15.     Although the feasibility and project preparation studies were
carried out largely as expezted, various delays occurred in the
implementation of the program.  This led to the extension of the closing
date from December 31, 1979 to M4arch 31, 1982. At the original closing
date, only 35% of the total project funds (US$1.4 million) were disbursed,
no disbursements were made during the first year. At the time of credit
closure, an amouvt of about US$314,000 remained undisbursed.
16.     Delays in project implementation were due to difficulties in the
start-up phase of thie project. The PPU suffered from very high staff
turnover among the professional staff and lacked adequate support services
and facilities. During the first year the PPU undertook a comprehensive
survey of all project studies which were carried out or scheduled to be
undertaken by the various Sudanese ministries and other public agencies, as
well as the international or bilateral donor inastitutions. However, an
Inventory was not completed until the second year of project
implementation, partly due to difficulties in recruiting a librarian to
organize the collected information. Similar delays occurred in the
establishment of an inventory of Sudanese and international consulting
firms, with particular qua fications for work in Sudan.
17.     The PPU attributed part of the delays in implementation to the
complicated and time consuming procedures adhered to by the Bank for the
use of consultants. The Bank evaluatcd the comments by the PPU and found
them partially valid. It was decided that the financial proposals of those
two or three consulting firms which submitted the best technical proposals
were to be evaluated, simultaneously with the technical proposals. This
procedure, however, could only be adopted if the technical proposals were
similar in quality.
18.     It was expectel that some of the studies financed under the project
would be executed by Sudanese firms.   Sudanese participation in the
studies financed, however, has been very small. Only one Sudanese

Project Preparation Unit as executing agency. Except for the Gezira
Rehabilitation Study which was jointly financed, no details are available
on the studies financed by the Kuwait Fund.

consulting firm has been solely responsible for the exectution of a study
(Rainfed Agriculture Development Study). In other instances, e.g. Study
for the Gezira Rehabilitation and Modernization Project and in the Water
Supply Studies, Sudanese firms participated as partners of foreign firms.
IV. GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE AND INSTITUTION BlJILDING UNDER TIIE PROJECT
19.     One of the main objectives of the technical assistance project was
to davelop institutional capacities in the Sudan for project preparation
and implementation. It was anticipated that the PPU would develop into a
unit whiclh would be able to initiate, supervise and implement project
preparation by itself and in collaboration with other agencies and act as
an intermediary between the various sectoral ministries. Although the PPU
basically carried out the responsibilities as assigned under the project,
it did not develop into the strong supervising and integrating institution
envisaged. It was not fully integrated into the Ministry of Planning and
also lacked the authority to integrate the activities of the various
ministries. Performance of the PPU,i however, did improve during the last
two years of project implementation.
20.     As many other agencies in the Sudan, the PPU suffe,ed from very
high staff turnover.  Generally one-third of the professional ztaff
positions were not filled or were temporarily vacant. Professional staff
either left for other positions, mostly in the neighboring Gulf States, or
participated in study programs abroad - a problem which is endangering the
functioning of almost all public organizations in Sudan. Under these
conditions it was difficult for the PPU to achieve, and sustain
effectiveness.
21.   Delayed completion of accounts and records constituted a serious
problem. PPU was unable to present up-to-date accounts of commitments
and/or disbursements made under either the IDA credit or the Kuwait loan.
Figures generally could only be obtained from IDA records. In spite of
continuous monitoring through IDA supervision teams the situation only
improved slightly during the second half of theproject implementation
period. The serious situation was due to a general lack of trained
accountants in the Sudan as well as the lack of established accounting
procedures for the Project.
22.     Another shortcoming of the project was the failure of the working
party system (para. 11). It has not developed into the integrating
instrument between the project unit and the sectoral ministries as
originally envisioned. Although working parties were generally established
for each sub-project they seldom had real influence in the decision making
process. An exception to this was the working party of the Gezira Study
which functioned well. Otherwise the work was carried out either by the
consultants with occasional input from PPU staff; by the relevant
government agency or the PPU in isolation. In almost all instances cily
junior officers had been assigned to these working parties, mnerely to
represent the ministry or agency involved without providing meaningful
professional input. During the last year of project implementation the
Government funds were made available to the PPU so that it could offer



incentives to members of working parties in order to secure adequate
participation.
23.     The Project Review Com -ittee remained a distant forum, which at
times was mere of an admliistrative bottleneck than a guiding and
decision-making body. The PRC held six meetings from 1976 to 1980,too few
to enable the Committee stay informed and become effective. Since the PRC
had to take a decision before a study could be financed by the Kuwait Fund
or IDA, the irregtularity of the meetings contrib.ted to the delays in
project implementation.
V. BANK PERFORMANCE
24.     The Project was supervised during six supervision missions under
the guidance of the East Africa Programs Department. Additional
supervision was provided by staff members of the Projects Divisions, who
visited Sudan and dealt with the respective studies, which were being
prepared in their sectors. The supervision missions were able to help
improve some of the critical i3sues. During thleir missions to Sudan, Bank
staff provided assistance to the PPU in the preparation of Terms of
Reference and in the supervision of the studies.
25.     The project implementation capacity of the PPU had been clearly
overestimated by the Bank at the time of project preparation and
appraisal. The three-year project implementation period as envisioned
during appraisal, was too short and the support which needed to be provided
to the PPU by Bank mission was more intensive than anticipated. This
continuous assistance was not provided but possibly could have expedited
the consolidation process of the PPU and avoided some delays in
implementation.
26.     Various lessons learned from the First Technical Assistance Project
were incorporated in the Second Technical Assistance Project (Credit
1153-SU), which became effective December 22, 1981. The role of the PPU
has been considerably strengthened by giving it the sole responsibility for
project preparation work and linking the unit directly to the office of the
Undersecretary of Planning. Moreover, a Project Coordination Committee was
established, headed by the Undersecretary of Planning to coordinate
implementation of the second project. This project includes, in addition
to project preparation, assistance in project implementation and
macroeconomic management. The implementation component includes: (a)
strengthening of accountancy capacity in the country; (b) improvement of
procurement procedures; (c) strengthening of monitoring and evaluation by
the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. The Macro-Economic
management component includes assistance in debt management and in
improvement of national accounts.
27.     Due to the rather mixed results under the first project, the
Project Review Committee has been discontinued. The working party system
has been maintained and efforts are being made to attract more qualified
staff as participants.

4. Rainfed Cotton Study
The study examined the possibilities of increasing cotton
production on rainfed areas and evaluated the economic and financial
competitiveness of raiafed cotton and other crops associated with rainfed
cotton in rotation.
The study included an examination of the types and varieties of
cotton grown, sources of seeds, seed rates, quality of seeds and present
practices of cotton cultivation. It also examined existing arrangements
for transport, marketing and pricing policies, the institutional
involvement in production and defined present and past levels of
productivity as well as the major constraints to expansion of cotton
production on rainfed areas. The study was carried out by Sudan Consulting
Bureau, Khartoum, Sudan.
5. Sugar Rehabilitation Study
The study provided a review of Sudan's sugar industry. It
described its basic structure, and past and current performance. The study
defined the operational constraints of the sugar industry and made
suggestions for revised sugar pricing policies, staff training and
recruitment policies and outlined administrative changes necessary to
improve the efficiency of the operational units. The study also defined
major capital investments needed to rehabilitate the sugar industry. The
study was prepared by the Economist Intelligence Unit, UK.
6. Water Supply Studies: Western Sudan, Khartoum, El Obeid and Kosti
Detailed feasibility studies were presented for the cities of El
Obeid, Kosti and Khartoum. The objectives of the studies were to identify
alternatives for supplying water to those.  It also asessed the need for
improvement of the present system of production and distribution of water.
The studies were undertaken by Sir Alexander Gibb, UK and Gannett Fleming,
USA.
7. Rail Track Study
The objectives of the study was to (i) increase track reliability
by eliminating or reducing effects of washouts, sand storms and speed
restrictions, (li) increase line capacity, and (iii) minimize cost of track
maintenance.
The study was undertaken in two parts. Part One surveyed 203 km
(Port Sudan-Haiya) to indicate weaknesses in embankment, used materials,
design protection works and to identify possible alternatives for improving
line capacity and to show technizal, financial and economic viability of
alternatives. Part Two of the study provided a survey for the rest of the

Dear Mr. Kapur,
Subject: Project Completion Report on Sudan-
Technical Assistance Project (Credit 614-SU)
Thank you very much for yot  letter of 25 July 1983 on the
evaluation of the above project. You may be aware that the involvement
of this office in implementation of the project, if any at all, was
marginal.
However, I found your repoit very interesting particularly
since the project in its implementation stage was faced with problems
similar to those faced by UNDP-assisted technical cooperation projects.
This is particularly true in relation to the inadequate staffing of
Government counterpart offices, very high staff turnover in sucb instittu-
tions and impossibility of achieving one of the basic objectives -upgrad-
ing of local capabilities to the level which might enable local institu-
tions to take over and run appropriate projects successfully without any
further expatriate inputs. Of course, this is one of the Sudan realities
and it has to be seriously taken into account at the formulation stage of
individual projects.
Yours sincerely,
D . L._A4
