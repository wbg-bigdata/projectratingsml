SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Agriculture is the most important sector in the Arab Republic of
Egypt providing about 30% of the GNP and employing about half of the total
labor force. Sustaining and improving land productivity is essential for
maintaining and improving the standard of life of the people. However, in the
absence of adequate drainage, growth of agricultural production has stagnated
just under 2% annually since 1965 because of the twin effect of waterlogging
and salinity. The situation became critical after the construction of the
Aswan High Dam in 1970 which made available to the farmers more water for
irrigation.
ii.       The proposed drainage project will comprise construction of four new
pumping stations and replacement of pumping units in two existing stations,
remodelling of open drains on 810,000 feddans and installation of field
drainage on 400,000 feddans. The total project area on which the above works
will be implemented is 1,000,000 feddans. Field drainage on the remaining
600,000 feddans will be implemented at a later stage. A Bilharzia control
component to expand the ongoing IDA/Bank financed program will also be in-
cluded to cover an additional area of 1,200,000 feddans in Upper Egypt.
In addition, provision was made for financing a Government contribution of
US$0.85 million to draw up a Master Plan for Water Resources, under a UNDP
project of which the Bank is the executing agency. The project is expected
to be completed in five years.
iii.      Total costs of the proposed project are estimated to be US$207 mil-
lion. The foreign exchange component is US$90 million of which US$54.3 mil-
lion for drainage works, US$10.4 for Bilharzia control, US$0.4 million for
Agricultural Extension Service and about US$0.9 million for the MIaster Plan.
It is expected that the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany through
the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) will finance the foreign exchange
costs of the production of PVC plastic pipes for field drains, estimated at
US$24 million. IDA and the Bank will finance the balance of foreign exchange
costs of US$66 million of which about US$21 million will be for the procure-
ment of equipment and materials and US$45 million for civil works. The
Government will bear all local costs estimated at US$117 million.
iv.       The Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects (EPADP) will
be responsible for executing all drainage works. The Ministry of Agriculture
will, in cooperation with EPADP, execute soil surveys and through its Exten-
sion Service, will assist in project implementation and maintenance. The
Bilharzia control operations will be administered by the Ministry of Health.
The Ministry of Irrigation will be responsible for the preparation of the
Water Master Plan.
v.        It is expected that the construction of pumping stations and the
remodelling of open drains will prevent further decline in land productivity
due to the lack of adequate drainage, over the total project area of 1,000,000
feddans. Field drainage which will be installed on 400,000 feddans will raise
present yields by 12-25%. The gross value of incre mental production of the
major crops from the project at current farm gate prices, which are lower than
international prices, will reach BE 8 million p.a. (US$12.0 million) within



- ii -
9 years of project commencement, an increase of 20% over the present level.
Additional benefits will accrue from preventing the further decline in
land productivity. The economic rate of return for the project, excluding
Bilharzia control and Water Master Plan, is estimated to be 23%. A sensi-
tivity analysis, testing the influence of increasing investment costs and
on-farm costs by 25% simultaneously with a decrease in value of benefits by
25% would lower the economic rate of return to 15.3%. As a result of the
project, the average annual income of about 295,000 farm families would
increase between 14 and 44%.
vi.       The necessary assurances having been obtained during negotiations,
the project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$27 million on standard terms,
a Bank loan of US$27 million with a term of 20 years including 4 1/2 years of
grace at interest of 8.2%, and a Third Window loan of US$12 million with first
repayment date January 15, 1983 and final maturity date January 15, 2001 at
interest of 4-17/2%. The borrower will be the Arab Republic of Egypt.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Waterlogging and salinity are considered the major limiting factors
to crop production of irrigated lands in the Arab Republic of Egypt. The
Government has therefore accorded high priority to improving the drainage
conditions throughout the country's irrigated lands. Government's plan
is to provide a total area of about 5,000,000 feddans with adequate field
drainage by 1990.
1.02      Works for installing an efficient drainage system in Egypt were
started by the Government in 1960 and have been supported by the Bank since
1970. Since that year three drainage projects have been financed by IDA and
the Bank, with a total amount oE US$122 million, covering a total area of
1,750,000 feddans, of which 530,000 feddans have so far been completed.
1.03      The Government has requested further IDA and Bank assistance to
assure the financing of the continuation of its drainage program. The pro-
posed fourth IDA/Bank drainage project is designed for providing the required
pumping stations and remodelling of open drains over an area of 1,000,000
feddans in the Nile Delta and for installing field drainage on 400,000
feddans of this area. A Bilharzia control component has also been included
in this project as it was the case in two of the previous projects. The
four IDA/Bank financed projects together with other Government projects will
provide by the end of 1982 some 2,930,000 feddans with field drainage, re-
presenting about 50% of the total irrigated area in Egypt.
1.04      Present capacity of EPADP allows an annual implementation rate of
remodelling of open drains on 280,000 feddans and of installation of field
drainage on 215,000 feddans. With the provision of additional equipment
under the third drainage project and with the introduction of PVC pipes and
foreign contractors for field drainage installation, it is expected that by
1978 the annual implementation capacity of EPADP will have increased for
remodelling to 400,000 feddans and for field drainage to 340,000 feddans.
In order to continuously employ this capacity it is important that the
proposed project becomes operational beginning 1978. It should be mentioned
that field drainage installation under the proposed project will not commence
before 1980, when the new pumping stations and the remodelling of open drains
on 400,000 feddans, will have been completed.
1.05      The project was prepared by the Government and the preparation
report was submitted to IDA and the Bank in September 1976. An IDA/Bank
appraisal mission, consisting of P. Economides (irrigation engineer,
mission leader); F. Sands (agriculturist); U. Kiermayr (economist); and
G. Webbe (Bilharzia specialist/consultant), visited the country during
October 1976.

II. BACKGROUND
General
2.01      Egypt is a large desert country with a total land area of approxi-
mately 1 million km2. The populated area is 35,850 km2 (3.6%) and the culti-
vated area approximately 25,000 km2 (2.5%). In the early 1950's, the cropped
area (cultivated area multiplied by cropping intensity) was 9.4 million feddans
for a population of 20 million. Each cropped feddan was required to support
2.1 persons. Now this figure is 3.5 persons per feddan due to the increase in
population.
Population
2.02      Egypt has a population of 38 million (1976) with a current popula-
tion growth rate of 2.5% per annum. About 96% of the country is very sparsely
populated. However, the remaining 4%, located mainly in the Nile Valley and
the Nile Delta, has one of the highest population densities in the world, with
over 1,000 persons per km2. The GNP per capita for the country in 1970 was
US$210 and for agriculture in the same year it was only US$100. In 1976, the
GNP per capita for the country was US$310 and US$150 for agriculture. The
relative poverty level in rural areas of the country is estimated to be about
US$60 per capita.
The Agricultural Sector
2.03      Egypt's agricultural sector as a source of food, fiber, foreign ex-
change and domestic resource mobilization is of extreme importance to the life
and economy of the country. Agriculture employs 46% of the working population,
provides about 30% of the GNP and is responsible for about 80% of foreign
exchange earnings. In addition, the vital textile industry as well as most of
the service sector--transport, commerce, government--are directly connected to
agriculture. During the 1955-65 period, agricultural production grew at a
rate of 3.5-4% annually. After 1965 agricultural growth declined and over the
past decade stagnated at an annual growth rate of 1.6%. On a per capita basis
this meant a decline of 0.7% per year. Food production has also declined
slightly on a per capita basis. This, together with changing consumption
patterns away from sorghum and maize to wheat and meat, which accompany
increasing urbanization, has necessitated increasing food imports at a time
when prices are at record high levels and Egypt's export income is declining.
The net result has been a serious drain on scarce foreign exchange.
2.04      Growth of agricultural imports far outstripped growth of agricul-
tural exports. Imports were mostly basic foodstuffs to supplement domestic
shortfalls in production and to meet an increasing demand from both popula-
tion growth and changes in consumption patterns. Food import costs rose
sharply from about US$250 million in 1972 to about US$1 billion in 1975.
Government subsidy costs to supply basic foods rose from US$100 million in
1972 to US$1.25 billion in 1975 and an estimated US$1.1 billion in 1976; the
major part of the fall between 1975 and 1976 is due to the decline in inter-
national prices. Other heavy subsidies are paid for fertilizers, pesticides,



- 3 -
irrigation, drainage, and agricultural credit. The subsidy bill for fertilizer
in 1975 alone amounted to nearly US$230 million. Despite these heavy foreign
exchange expenditures and the absorption of high subsidy costs, the Government
has not been able to prevent food prices from rising 60% since 1967.
2.05      The construction of the Aswan High Dam made intensification and
extension of the irrigation system possible. Cropping intensity rose to
almost two. Mounting population and a substantial number of landless
farmers led the Government to undertake a program to expand the agricultural
land. However, costs of bringing new land into production have proven higher
than expected, the potential lower, and gestation periods longer than planned.
It now has become obvious that. instead of the 3-5 year period initially used
in planning new land development works, a minimum of 15 years' capital absorp-
tion will be required before sufficient income can be earned to cover even
operating expenses. However, better planning and coordination of construction,
extension and other agricultural support services could improve the situation
and shorten the development period.
2.06      The Land Reform Act of 1952 and its subsequent amendments have
changed the basic land tenure situation in Egypt. Prior to the revolution,
94% of all farmers owned 35% of the land while less than 0.2% owned 27% of
the land. In the course of the land reform about one-sixth of the farm land
was redistributed among small farmers and tenants were provided with greater
protection. The maximum holding today is 50 feddans per person or 100 feddans
per family. Despite the land reform and redistribution program, as prior to
the revolution, 94% of the farmers have an average holding of less than five
feddans and approximately 70% of the farmers have an average holding of less
than three feddans. The main achievement of the land reform is that the size
of the holdings of the upper 6% has been reduced. Further measures taken to
improve the conditions of farmers were in the form of policy controls over the
conditions of production, the pattern of investment and the distribution of
income. The major control imposed over the conditions of production was com-
pulsory cooperative membership through which the production decisions of the
many small independent farmers were directed. In practice this system has not
been as effective as desired for a number of reasons, such as complicated lines
of authority, policy of controlled commodity prices, development of parallel
markets, and the excessive degree of concentration of powers.
2.07      During the last decade, the agricultural sector has faltered.  More-
over, a large portion of the reclaimed lands, roughly two-thirds, has not been
made fully productive. The groundwater level has risen seriously as a result
of the increase in water application and lack of drainage facilities adversely
affecting the productivity of considerable areas. Shortage of capital, con-
trol over prices, marketing of the major crops and regulated cropping patterns
have further hampered agricuLtural production.
2.08      Preparation of a medium-term development plan for 1976-80 has not
yet been completed. A preliminary draft of the plan shows that agriculture
ranks third in development priority behind the transport and communication
sectors and the industry and mining sector. While agriculture has consistently



accounted for about 30% of GNP over the past decade, its share in total gov-
ernment current expenditure has remained at a relatively constant 4.5% and
its share in total investment has been declining. In the past, investment
allocations for agriculture were heavily weighted in favor of new land develop-
ment. Due to the above-mentioned serious problems which developed in the
government's horizontal expansion program and to resource constraints, invest-
ment allocations within the agricultural sector are being revised. In the
1976-80 draft develoment plan 10% of total investments are allocated to the
agricultural sector.
2.09      To restore and maintain the productive capacity of most of Egypt's
agricultural land which has been adversely affected by waterlogging and sa-
linity, heavy investments in drainage have become the prime requirement. The
effects of inputs such as fertilizer and improved seed are determined by the
most limiting factor--drainage--and therefore cannot be maximized. These
facts have been recognized by the Government and restoring adequate drainage
facilities is being given a high priority.
Previous Bank Drainage Projects in Egypt
2.10      The first IDA project (Nile Delta Drainage I) became effective
in December 1970. IDA, through a credit of US$26.0 million, provided funds
for: (a) equipment for the construction and remodelling of main open drains;
(b) equipment and erection of 11 new pumping stations; (c) cement pipe making
factories, pipe laying machines, and other equipment for field drainage on
950,000 feddans; and (d) vehicles, workshops, laboratory and office equipment.
Up to the end of 1976, construction and remodelling of main open drains were
completed on 680,000 feddans; out of the eleven pumping stations, five are
operational; and field drains had been installed on 480,000 feddans.
2.11      The second IDA project (Upper Egypt Drainage I) became effective
in September 1973. IDA, through a credit of US$36.0 million, provided funds
for: (a) equipment for the construction and remodelling of main open drains;
(b) equipment and erection of five new pumping stations; (c) pipe laying
machines and other equipment for field drainage on 300,000 feddans; (d)
vehicles, workshops, laboratory and office equipment; and (e) molluscicides,
drugs and equipment for a Bilharzia control program covering 900,000 feddans.
Up to the end of 1976, construction and remodelling of main open drains was
completed on 230,000 feddans; one pumping station became operational; and
field drains were installed on 50,000 feddans. Satisfactory progress has
been made on the Bilharzia control program.
2.12      The third IDA/Bank project (Upper Egypt Drainage II) became effective
in January 1977. IDA/Bank through a credit of US$40 million and a loan of
US$10 million, provided funds for: (a) equipment for the construction and
remodelling of main open drains; (b) equipment and erection of one new pumping
station; (c) equipment and civil works for field drainage on 500,000 feddans;
(d) vehicles, workshops, laboratory and office equipment; and (e) mollusci-
cides, drugs and equipment for the expansion of Bilharzia control program over
an additional area of 120,000 feddans located between the Asyut and Dairut

barrages. USAID is participating in the financing of this project through a
loan of US$31 million which covers foreign exchange cost for the production
of PVC plastic pipes for field drainage.
2.13      The first two drainage projects have faced a number of problems
in the past, namely lack of local funds, shortage of engineers, shortage of
cement for the production of pipes, poor performance of local contractors and
other managerial difficulties. The situation became very critical after the
1973 October war and little was achieved during 1974. However, since mid-1975,
the situation has improved and subsequently, for the first time, in 1976, the
targets of the two projects for the year were reached. It is expected that if
the required local funds are available, the Nile Delta I and Upper Egypt I
Drainage Projects will be completed by the end of 1979 and the end of 1980,
respectively, compared to original estimates of 1976 and 1977. The table
hereunder shows the results obtained to date and the planned implementation
schedule for the entire drainage program in Egypt up to 1983.

III. PROJECT AREA
General
3.01      The proposed project is located in six governorates of the Nile
Delta. The project contains 20 drainage catchment areas covering approxi-
mately 1,000,000 feddans in the east, west and central part of the Delta
within 25 km of the Mediterranean in the north, to about 150 km away from
the coast at the southern most limit of the project. Field drainage will be
installed in 10 catchment areas while only remodelling of open drains would
be implemented in the other 10 catchment areas. The project area is shown
on Map IBRD 12596. Details as to catchment areas are given in Annex 4.
Climate
3.02      The climate in the area (Annex 1) is classified as Mediterranean.
The cool winter period extends from November through March and the hot summer
season from May to September. At Tanta, in the center of the project area,
the mean daily temperature varies from a mean maximum of 34.50C in July and
August to a mean minimum of 6.OOC in January. The mean humtdity varies
from a low of 65% in March to a high of 73% in July. From the coast inland,
rainfall decreases, being annually approximately 187 mm at Alexandria, 78.5 mm
at Sakha, 46 mm at Tanta and 26 mm at Cairo. During July the winds are mainly
from the north shifting to the southwest in January. The climate in the
region favors the growth of a variety of high value crops under irrigation.
Topography and Soils
3.03      The topography of the Delta is flat with a gentle average slope
of 7.7 cm per km from Cairo towards the sea. The soils are primarily heavy
deltaic alluvium and tend to be lighter in the southern region. The alluvium
averages 9 to 10 m deep and overlies deep deposits of water bearing sands and
gravels. These soils have been formed from the settling of suspended matter
brought down by the Nile for centuries. The sediments have come from the
weathering of igneous rocks and are rich in plant nutrients such as potassium,
calcium, magnesium, iron and phosphorus. They are highly productive. When
supplied with irrigation water and drainage is satisfactory, they can support
good crops of cotton, wheat, maize, rice, vegetables, beans, Egyptian clover
and some fruits (Annex 2).
Irrigation and Drainage Conditions
3.04      The Ministry of Irrigation through its control of the main canals
regulates water supply according to the crops and soils. In the summer, the
irrigation cycle for rice is 4 days, for corn 15 days and for cotton 15-20
days, depending upon the soil. In the winter, an irrigation cycle of 7 days
is generally followed. Because of the abundance of water, farmers tend to
overirrigate their fields thereby contributing to the drainage problem.



- 8 -
3.05      The annual volume of water available for diversion from the Nile
in the Delta since the first barrage was commissioned in 1890, averaged about
26 billion m3. However, this supply has recently been increased to 56 billion
m3 by the construction of the Aswan High Dam. The Nile water has a low salt
content averaging about 200 parts per million. Nevertheless, the quantity of
salt passing arnually into the Delta soils for the last 87 years has been about
1.5 tons per irrigated feddan. It is now evident that too low a proportion of
this salt is being leached out of the soil by effective percolation, with the
result that the salt accumulation has already reached a level which is poten-
tially dangerous to crops in more than half of the northern part of the Delta
and in the eastern and western sectors of the project.
3.06      Since the introduction of perennial irrigation during the last
century, the natural drainage of the Delta has been increasingly incapable
of discharging the large quantity of surface run-off and year-round seepage
from the fields and canals.   Despite the construction of a widespread system
of surface drains and pumping stations over the past 47 years, the groundwater
table has gradually risen. As a result, it is now less than 60 cm from the
surface in much of the area for several months of the year (Annex 2). The
high water table causes waterlogging and prevents leaching of incoming salts
from the root zone. If the productivity of the area is to be maintained,
accumulated salinity must be removed and the high water table must be lowered.
The installation of sub-surface field drainage on a massive scale thus becomes
a prerequisite for preserving this productive area of Egypt. Field drainage,
as proposed for the project, is an appropriate method to extract excess
groundwater and control its level.
Salinity and Alkali Conditions
3.07      Most of the soils in the project area are non-saline soils (EC-
Saturation Extract less than 4 mmhos/cm). However, in the northern sector
of the East Delta and in parts of the West Delta there are fairly large and
numerous patches of moderate, strongly and even very strongly saline soils.
In the Central Delta, small parcels of moderately saline soils are found.
No major alkali problem is expected in the project area.
Agricultural Production
3.08      The cropping patterns are well established throughout the project
area, with cotton, rice, wheat and maize being the major crops (Annex 4).
Cotton controls the cropping pattern and its acreage throughout the entire
country is determined by decree each year issued by the Ministry of Agricul-
ture. Rice production is also controlled by the Ministry of Agriculture, and
because of its water requirement (amount and frequency) is confined to the
northern portion of the Delta. Cotton is usually grown on the same land
every third year and is preceded by a short crop of berseem (Egyptian clover).
Wheat or clover usually follows cotton in the winter. In the southern parts
of the project, maize follows wheat and clover in the summer and in the
northern regions, rice and/or maize are the summer crops. Cropping intensity
is approximately 190% in the project area. The only time fields are vacant is
the short land preparation period between harvest of one crop and the planting
of another.



- 9 -
3.09      In spite of the fact that high-yielding strains of cotton, rice,
wheat and maize have been introduced, fertilizer applications have increased,
disease and insect control improved and support services expanded, the yields
of rice, wheat and maize have remained constant on average over the decade
since 1965. Cotton yields, on the other hand, have decreased markedly since
1969 (Annex 4, Table 10). Also, in certain areas yields of all the major
crops have already declined. The major reason for this situation is attri-
buted to the constant deterioration of the cultivated lands due to water-
logging and salinity. In the 26 districts, which are scheduled for field
drainage under the proposed project, the 1972-75 average yields on those
soils suffering from waterlogging and salinity show as much as a 46% reduc-
tion in yield for maize, 50% for cotton and wheat and 30% for rice, below
the average yields on soils in the same district which are not seriously
affected by waterlogging and salinity (Annex 4, Table 8). Without adequate
drainage facilities, it has been estimated that average crop yields in the
project area would decline by at least 30% over the next 35 years.
Agricultural Support Services
3.10      The Ministry of Agriculture, through its agencies, provides a number
of services to promote agricultural development. The most important agencies
are the Agricultural Cooperative Organization, the Egyptian General Organiza-
tion for Agricultural and Cooperative Credit, the Agricultural Extension
Service and the Agricultural Research Center. The various Research Depart-
ments breed new, superior, high-yielding varieties while the Department of
Seeds handles the production, processing, certification, testing and distri-
bution of seeds. The Extension Service has trained university graduates at
the district level and, to a limited extent, at the village level, to assist
farmers in the production, protection, marketing and storage of farm crops.
The agricultural support services lack the required effectiveness at village
level. The Extension Service is now being supported by USAID and FAO through
the provision of consultants to upgrade its efficiency. Assistance under the
present project is limited to the supply of some transportation and audio-
visual equipment.
Population and Land Tenure
3.11      About 295,000 farm families, consisting of an average of 5.4 persons,
live in the project area benefiting from the drainage works. Total population
in this area is therefore estimated to be about 1.6 million. The land tenure
situation is rather unclear. According to the national agricultural census,
carried out in 1960, approximately 40% of the farms are owner cultivated, 30%
are rented and the remaining 30% consist of owner-tenant operated holdings.
It is expected that the land tenure situation in the project area is similar
to the nationwide picture.
Credit, Marketing, Transportation and Storage
3.12      Credit to agriculture is planned and organized by the Egyptian
General Organization for Agricultural and Cooperative Credit (EGOACC). The
actual credit outlets consist of 17 Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Banks



- 10 -
(ACCB) at governorate level and about 4,000 local cooperatives at village
level. Almost 99% of the loans made annually are provided for crop produc-
tion, cattle raising and cattle fattening, for periods not exceeding 14 months.
Credit for crop production is granted at fixed amounts per feddan in kind and
cash calculated each year for each crop and each district by consultation
between the EGOACC and technical sections of the Ministry of Agriculture.
Medium-term loans are granted mainly for purchase of farm machinery, develop-
ment of orchards and cattle breeding. Both short-term and medium-term loans
carry an interest rate of 4.5% for the ultimate borrower. This lending rate
is two percentage points lower than the average borrowing rate of EGOACC, the
difference being paid by the Government. Total lending for agriculture in the
country reached LE 83.8 million in 1974/75. Plans to strengthen and reorganize
Egypt's financially and organizationally extremely weak agricultural credit
structure are presently being reviewed. In addition to the funds made avail-
able through the ACCB/EGOACC system, some of the country's commercial banks
provide limited credit facilities for marketing and processing of agricultural
products. The traditional non-institutional credit outlets like money lenders,
traders, commission agents, friends and relatives also lend funds in cash or
kind for a variety of purposes.
3.13      Egypt has a mixed marketing system composed of official and private
enterprises. Administered prices and compulsory sales to the cooperative
system characterize the official side of the marketing system which handles
cotton and sugarcane exclusively and specified proportions of wheat, rice
and some other crops. Parallel to the official market exists the "free"
village market for over-quota amounts of produce which typically offers
higher prices than the official marketing channels.
3.14      Transportation does not pose a serious limitation.  The road and
railway system, together with water transport on the Nile, provide good con-
nections with major consumption centers and ports. Communications within
the Nile Delta are satisfactory. Storage capacities of the marketing system
are not adequate but due to the extremely dry climate losses are not excessive.
Agricultural Taxation
3.15      Two types of taxes are levied on farm land:  The basic land tax
which is stated as a fixed amount in LE per feddan is destined for the general
revenue and is levied on all farm lands. Presently this tax averages LE 4 per
feddan per annum and must be paid by the owner of the land. To support defense
efforts a special security tax was introduced in 1967 which equals the basic
land tax and is paid by the user of the land. The land tax is levied against
the estimated value of production from the land, and is expressed as 14% of
the actual or potential rent of the land. Tax reassessments are to be carried
out every ten years. As a special concession to the small farmers, land tax
for holdings of less than 3 feddans was suspended in 1973 by Law No. 51.

IV. THE PROJECT
Objectives
4.01      The objectives of the project are:
(a) to prevent decline in land productivity on one million
feddans in the Nile Delta through construction of pumping
stations and remodeling of the main drainage system;
(b) to increase productivity on about 400,000 feddans, out of
the one million, through the installation of field drains;
(c) to expand the on-going Bilharzia control program under the
two Upper Egypt Drainage projects by 1,200,000 feddans thereby
instituting a control program over the entire cultivated
area from Giza to the Aswan High Dam; and
(d) to cover part of foreign exchange expenditures for a UNDP-
financed project designed to draw up a "Master Plan for
Water Resources Development and Use", for which the Bank
is acting as executing agency.
Project Drainage Works
4.02      The project drainage works (Annex 3) will affect approximately
1,000,000 feddans in the Nile Delta and will consist of:
(a) construction of four new drainage pumping stations,
including electric transmission lines;
(b) replacement of ten obsolete pumping units in two existing
drainage pumping stations;
(c) deepening and widening of 1,565 km of existing open main
drains serving an area of 810,000 feddans including ex-
tension or reconstruction of the existing structures; and
(d) installation of covered field drains and collectors in
an area of 400,000 feddans.
Annex 3, Table 1 shows the areas that will be affected by the above drainage
works.
Pumping Stations
4.03      Of the total project area of 1,000,000 feddans, the discharge
effluent from 400,000 feddans will be evacuated into the Nile or into main
open drains by gravity. The effluent from the remaining 600,000 feddans
will be evacuated through seven existing and four new pumping stations. The



- 12 -
four new pumping stations, serving an area of 118,000 feddans will together
have 14 electrically driven pump units of a discharge varying from 1 to 5
m3/sec and an operating head from 0.60 to 4.50 m. Electric transmission lines
of 19 km length in total will connect these stations to the national grid.
Ten more pump units will be provided under the project for the replacement of
an equal number of obsolete units in two of the existing stations, affecting
193,000 feddans.
Remodelling of Open Drains
4.04      The existing network of open main and branch drains was designed
to keep the water level in the drains at approximatley 1.50 m below ground
surface. Experience during the last few decades has shown that this water
level is inadequate to ensure good drainage conditions for the crops. To
further lower the ground water and to provide free-fall discharge from the
pipe collectors of the field drainage system, the open main and branch drains
will have to be widened and deepened to a water level of no less than 2.50
m below ground surface. Existing bridges, syphons, flumes and other struc-
tures will have to be either extended or rebuilt. It is estimated that on
approximately 190,000 feddans of the project area, the existing open drains
have sufficient capacity and depth and do not need any widening or deepening.
Therefore, the remodelling of open drains will affect 810,000 feddans. It is
expected that with the installation of new pumping stations and the remodelling
of the open drains, the decline in land productivity would be prevented.
Field Drainage
4.05      Field drainage will be installed on 400,000 feddans of the project
area. The selection of this area was made on the basis of present drainage
conditions, giving priority to areas severely suffering from waterlogging and
salinity. The remaining project area of 600,000 feddans would be provided with
field drainage at a later stage. With the installation of field drainage it
is intended to reduce the water table to at least 1 m below the ground sur-
face within 48-72 hours following irrigation. To achieve this, field drains
will be installed at a minimum depth of 1.50 m at the point of their connec-
tion with the pipe collectors. The spacing of field drains is calculated on
the basis of physical soil characteristics, the calculated values being rounded
to the nearest standard spacing adopted by EPADP, i.e., 40, 50 and 60 m. Field
drains will be about 200 m long and will discharge into cement pipe collectors,
which will evacuate the drainage water into the open main drains. Vertical
drainage with tubewells is not recommended. Besides the uncertainty that this
type of drainage presents, the available data indicate that vertical drainage
cannot be considered as an economical alternative to the parallel drainage
with covered pipes.
4.06      PVC corrugated plastic pipes of 80 mm in diameter will be used in
90% (360,000 feddans) of the area, cultivated with field crops, to be provided
with field drainage. The PVC pipes will be manufactured locally. Two plants
with a capacity of 1,000 m/hour of pipes will be imported. The raw material
(resin powder), required for the production of PVC pipes, estimated at 11,000



- 13 -
tons, will also be imported. The installation of the PVC pipes will be made
by using trench pipe laying machines, similar to those used for cement pipes
in the ongoing drainage projects, unless field tests prove that trenchless
machines can be used in the Delta soils successfully and economically. The
selection of PVC pipes for fielcl drainage was made because of the advantages
they offer in comparison to cement pipes used in the past, namely easier
transportation, higher output of pipe laying machines due to the simplified
logistics, and lower total cost. In the remaining area of 40,000 feddans
which is cultivated with orchards, cement pipes, 10 cm in diameter, will be
used for field drains. In this area, the excavation of trenches and the
laying of pipes will be done manually as the use of machinery in densely
planted orchards is not feasible. Assuming an average spacing of 50 m, the
total length of field drains will be 32,400 km of PVC pipes and 3,600 km of
cement pipes. It is recommended that a gravel envelope of approximately 5
cm thickness will be placed around the field drains in order to (i) prevent
sediment from flowing into the pipe drains; (ii) provide adequate permeability
for the ground water to converge into the pipe drains without a significant
loss of head; and (iii) provide an additional discharge area around the pipe
drains. The recommended gradation of gravel is given in Annex 3.
4.07      For the collectors, cement pipes of a diameter varying from 15 to
40 cm will be used. The installation of the collectors in the area cultivated
with field crops is expected to be done by using special heavy duty pipe laying
machines, should the on-going test in Egypt of one of these machines proves
satisfactory. If this should not be the case, regular trenchers will be used.
In orchards the excavation of trenches and the laying of collector pipes will
be done manually, as for field drains.
4.08      The three cement pipe making plants which have been constructed
under the Nile Delta Drainage I Project will be used in the future to produce
cement pipes for collectors and for field drains in orchards under the proposed
project as well as for replacement of cement pipes, installed in the past. To
increase the production of collector pipes five new machines, at a total cost
of US$300,000, will be required. The cost of these machines will be included
in the project.
4.09      The installation of field drainage under the proposed project will
not commence before 1980 for two reasons: (i) EPADP's and contractor's
efforts should be concentrated on the installation of field drainage in the
remaining area of 470,000 fedans of the Nile Delta Drainage I Project due
for completion in December 1979; and (ii) field drainage cannot be installed
prior to the construction and rehabilitation of the pumping stations and the
remodelling of open drains. Therefore, during the first two years the project
activities will be limited to the construction of pumping stations and remodel-
ling of open drains. Installation of field drainage will start at the begin-
ning of 1980 and will be completed by the end of 1982.
4.10      The project will also provide vehicles and audio-visual equipment
for extension service and office and laboratory equipment for EPADP.

Bilharzia Control
4.11       Bilharzia is endemic in the entire irrigated area between Aswan
and Cairo. The Bilharzia control program was initiated under the Upper Egypt
Drainage I project and extended under the Upper Egypt Drainage II project.
The control program consists of integrated snail control measures supplemented
by treatment of infected persons (chemotherapy). This program will now be
further extended under the proposed project to cover an additional area of
1,200,000 feddans between Asyut and the Aswan High Dam, with a total popula-
tion of about 5 million people (Annex 2 and Map IBRD 12717).
Master Plan for Water Resources
4.12      An agreement has been reached between Government and UNDP to carry
out a project for the study of water related problems in Egypt. The Bank has
been appointed executing agency for this project (EGY/73/024/A/01/42) entitled
"Master Plan for Water Resources Development and Use". The project is designed
to produce recommendations on important short-term policy and investment issues
and to provide a long term framework for the formulation of policies for water
resource development, water use, investment programs for economical optimal
development, efficient operating procedures, proposal for ensuring a continuing
analysis and training of staff. Duration of the project is 42 months. UNDP
will contribute US$1,250,000.  The Government has requested an IDA credit of
US$850,000 to cover the remaining foreign exchange expenditures of the Master
Plan. This amount has been included in the present project. All local costs
estimated at EE 640,500 of which BE 232,200 in cash and EbE 408,300 in kind
will be borne by the Government.
Status of Engineering
4.13      A detailed soil survey covering the Lower Delta was conducted and
published in 1971 by the Ministry of Agriculture. 1/ Field investigations
and detailed design for field drainage will be conducted during the two first
years of project implementation by EPADP's design office. The present staff
will be increased by an adequate number of engineers to meet the design
requirements of all drainage projects. A considerable amount of the design
work for the remodelling of open main drains and for the reconstruction of
hydraulic structures has already been conducted by the regional technical
offices of EPADP. As the remodelling of open drains will take four years,
there is sufficient time for the timely completion of the remaining design
work. Final plans for the pumping stations will be prepared by the supplier-
contractor according to the specifications and after approval by EPADP.
Concerning the replacement of the pumping units in the two existing pumping
stations, EPADP will furnish the supplier with accurate designs of the buil-
dings and will ask the supplier to provide suitable pumping units that can
be installed without major modifications of the buildings. Designs for work-
shops, stores, sheds, etc., will be prepared by the design office of EPADP.
Technical specifications for equipment and civil works will be prepared by
EPADP's mechanical department and design office, respectively.

Consulting Services
4.14      The Egyptian Government has been granted technical assistance from
the Dutch Government for consulting services in the field of water management
and drainage of agricultural land. A joint panel of Dutch and Egyptian con-
sultants has been set up to advise EPADP on technical problems related to the
implementation of the drainage program and to formulate a program of specific
studies (drainage methods, establishment of monitoring of drainage systems,
water management, etc.) to be carried out by the Government. Two resident
consultants have already been recruited under the Dutch agreement to assist
the Government in carrying out these studies. The panel meets two times a
year for a period of 1-2 weeks. EPADP will require additional advice and
assistance in using PVC pipes for field drainage and for training local staff
in the new techniques involved. Funds for consultants have been provided
under the Upper Egypt Drainage I Project and their recruitment is underway.
Construction Schedule
4.15      The construction of the four pumping stations will commence in
the first year of the project with the pump units being installed during the
second year and becoming operational in the third year. The project will
provide a sufficient number of excavating machines and auxiliary equipment
to complete the remodelling of the open main drains within four years.
Structures on the main drains will be built during the same period. Equip-
ment for the PVC pipe plants will be ordered and installed during the second
year of the project and the plants will become fully operational at the
beginning of the third year. Field drainage installations will commence in
third year and continue up to the fifth year with an average annual rate of
130,000-140,000 feddans.  The implementation of remodelling of open drains and
installation of field drainage is estimated to proceed ,as follows:
Calendar Year            1978      1979      1980     1981       1982    Total

Table on page 6 shows the overall construction schedule for drainage works
in Egypt.  Chart IBRD 16775 shows the implementation schedule of the proposed
project. The schedule for field drainage installation could be adversely
affected by delays in the remodelling of open drains, erection of pumping
stations and installation of PVC pipe plants. Therefore, timely awards of
contracts for the above works is essential. Assurances to this effect have
been obtained during negotiations. EPADP will together with IDA/Bank periodi-
cally review the progress of drainage works. Assurances to this effect have
been obtained during negotiations.
Cost Estimates
4.16      On the basis of end 1976 prices, the total project cost is estimated
to be US$207 million plus an estimated US$4.8 million in custom duties. The
foreign exchange component is estimated to be US$90 million. In preparing the



- 16 -
project cost estimates the following considerations were taken into account:
(i) costs for pumping stations and their equipment were based on unit prices
of similar stations awarded in early 1976 under the Upper Egypt Drainage I
project, increased by 10%; (ii) costs for remodelling of open drains were
based on recent unit prices of awarded contracts to local contractors; (iii)
costs for plants and raw material for the production of PVC pipes were based
on recent price information from manufacturers; (iv) costs for operation and
maintenance of PVC plants were based on detailed calculations under Egyptian
conditions with allowance for overhead costs and contractor's profit and
risk; (v) costs for installation of field drains and for construction of pipe
collectors by foreign contractors were based on current unit prices of con-
tracts awarded to local contractors, adjusted for using PVC pipes and allowing
overhead costs and foreign contractor's profit and risk; (vi) costs for mol-
luscicide and drugs for Bilharzia control were based on recent unit prices
of awarded contracts. A physical contingency of about 10% for equipment and
15% for civil works and administration to cover changes in amount of work and
unforeseen costs has been included. A price contingency also has been in-
cluded, calculated on the basis of a price factor increase for equipment of 8%
for 1977, and 7% p.a. for 1978-82; and for civil works of 12% for 1977, and
10% p.a. for 1978-82. Detailed estimates of the project cost are given in
Annex 5 and summarized below:

Financing
4.17      The foreign exchange cost of equipment and civil works for pumping
stations, remodelling of open drains, installation of field drains, of equip-
ment, molluscicides and drugs for the Bilharzia control component, of equipment
for the Extension Service and the foreign exchange contribution to the Master
Plan for Water Resources will be financed by IDA and the Bank. The Government
has requested assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany through the
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) to finance equipment, materials and
other foreign exchange costs of the production of PVC pipes. The failure of
the agreement with KfW becoming effective by December 31, 1977 or by another
date to be agreed upon between the Government and IDA/Bank, will be a condition
of default under the IDA/Bank agreements unless the Government will be able to
secure the additional foreign funds required from other sources.

lion of which US$54.3 million is for drainage works, US$10.4 million is for
Bilharzia control, US$0.4 million is for Agricultural Extension Service and
about US$0.9 million for contribution to the Master Plan for Water Resources.
The cofinancier (KfW) will contribute US$24 million for equipment, materials,

and other foreign exchange costs of the production of PVC pipes. The Govern-
ment will provide the balance of US$117 million in local currency. In addition,
Government will bear the cost of custom duties estimated at US$4.8 million
equivalent.
4.19      The total amount of local funds required between 1977 and 1982 for
the completion of the oagoing and the proposed drainage projects have been
estimated at BE 270 million (Ainex 5, Table 6). Assurances have been received
from the Gcvernment prior to negotiations that (i) the local funds required
for fiscal year 1977 for the ongoing IDA/Bank financed drainage projects have
been included in EPADP's budget of this year and (ii) local funds required
in the future for the IDA/Bank financed drainage projects will be included
in the Medium Term Development Plan.
4.20      The Government will establish a Special Fund from which EPADP may
draw without restriction the required funds for implementing the IDA/Bank
financed drainage projects. This Fund will help overcome the difficulties
experienced in the past in obtaining timely allocation of local funds. The
Government will replenish the Special Fund at monthly intervals to a level
equivalent to the estimated local expenditures during the following three
month period. The establishment of the Special Fund is a condition of
effectiveness of the credit/loan.
Procurement and Contracts
4.21      Equipment and materials (except molluscicide and drugs) financed
by IDA/Bank (US$10.4 million) 1/ will be procured through international
competitive bidding, according to IDA/Bank Guidelines. Domestic bids will
be allowed a margin of preference of 15% or the actual customs duty, which-
ever is lower. For purposes of bid comparison the parallel market exchange
rate will be applied. Small contracts of up to US$10,000 equivalent for
equipment may be awarded on a competitive basis to reliable suppliers after
having obtained quotations, whenever practicable, from at least three such
suppliers. The aggregate expenditure for items so procured will not exceed
US$150,000 equivalent. Proprietary equipment estimated to cost in the aggre-
gate up to US$150,000 equivalent may be purchased off-the-shelf from reliable
suppliers. In the event the aggregate cost of this equipment will exceed
US$150,000 equivalent, the Government will consult with IDA and the Bank on
the procurement procedures to be followed. Assurances on the above procurement
procedures have been obtained during negotiations.
4.22      The molluscicide ancl the oral drug used for the Bilharzia control
are produced at present by only one West German manufacturer. The mollus-
cicide is also produced by a licensee in the USA. Both products have been
approved by WHO and have been tested in the project area and proven to be
the most effective ones available. They will therefore be procured from the
manufacturer thereof at an estimated cost of US$8.9 million.

4.23      Civil works for pumping stations and for installation of field
drainage with PVC pipes, financed by IDA/Bank (US$31.2 million) will be
procured through international competitive bidding, according to IDA/Bank
guidelines. Bidders will be required to present evidence of their previous
experience in carrying out such works. The contractors who would participate
in the bidding will be requested to submit a list of equipment they intend to
import into the country for the execution of the contract in accordance with
the construction schedule. The value of this equipment, if approved by the
Government and IDA/Bank, will be advanced to the contractors in the form of a
mobilization award (Annex 3, para 24). In all cases, contractors will be
required to provide experienced operators and mechanics to train Egyptian
staff in the use and maintenance of the imported equipment. For purposes of
bid comparison the parallel market exchange rate will be applied. Assurances
on the above procurement procedures have been obtained during negotiations.
4.24      Civil works for structures in open drains, installation of field
drainage in orchards with cement pipes and buildings (workshops, stores,
sheds, etc.), financed by IDA/Bank (US$9.4 million) will be awarded to local
contractors after bidding on the basis of local advertising and in conformity
with other local procurement procedures acceptable to IDA and the Bank (Annex
3, para 13). These small and varied works 1/, scattered throughout the proj-
ect area, and planned to be implemented during the whole project construction
period, are not suitable for international competition.
4.25      Civil works (earth works) for remodelling of open drains, financed
only by the Government, will be awarded to local contractors on the basis of
local procedures described in Annex 3 (paras 9-12). Contracts will include
provision for the transfer of project equipment and spare parts to the con-
tractors under terms already established by EPADP for the previous drainage
projects and found acceptable by IDA/Bank. For the calculation of the value
of the equipment the parallel market exchange rate will be used.
4.26      Goods and services to be financed under the KfW loan will be procured
in accordance with KfW procurement policies.
Disbursement
4.27      The proposed credit of US$27 million and loans of US$39 million will
be disbursed over a five-year period as follows:
i/   It is expected that the number of structures to be rebuilt in the
open drains will be 1,400 at a cost per structure varying from
bE 2,000 to SE 20,000, the number of contracts for installation
of field drainage in orchards with cement pipes will be about
30 with an average cost of BE 80,000, and the number of buildings
will be about 20 with an average cost of BE 25,000.

Environmental Impact
4.29      The implementation of the project will have beneficial effects on
the environment due to the land improvement and the Bilharzia control program.
The installation of field drains, remodelling of open drains and erection of
new pumping stations will lower the water table, and therefore improve the
hygienic conditions of the area. The Bilharzia control component of the proj-
ect\will improve the health and well being of approximately 5,000,000 persons
in Upper Egypt. By the use of molluscicide, the vector snails, now found in
the canals and drains from Asyut to Aswan, will be destroyed. This will
reduce the possibility of contaminating the already treated areas north of
Asyut. Chemotherapy will supplement the eradication of the disease efforts
by reducing the source of contamination of the water courses. Although the
molluscicide to be used (Bayluscide) may have some adverse effects on fish,
the chemical being biodegradable, it would not harm human beings even if the
fish is consumed.

V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Authority Responsible for Drainage Works
5.01      The Egyptian Public Atuthority for Drainage Projects (EPADP), estab-
lished by Presidential Decree in 1973, is responsible for implementing drainage
works under the proposed and previous IDA/Bank financed projects. EPADP is
headed by a Chairman and it is empowered to carry out field investigations,
planning, design, procurement, construction, budgeting, and operation of
project accounts. For planning, design and execution of drainage works two
Vice-Chairmen are responsible, one for projects in Upper Egypt and one for
projects in Lower Egypt. Attached to each Vice-Chairman is a special design
office responsible for detailed design of project works. Field supervision of
drainage works in the project area is the responsibility of the four regional
offices of EPADP in the Delta. The mechanical department of EPADP is respon-
sible for supervising the installation of pumping stations, transmission
lines, maintenance workshops, stores, and for mechanical equipment. Chart
IBRD 16856 shows the present organization of EPADP. Assurances have been
obtained during negotiations that a qualified and experienced Chairman and a
qualified and experienced Vice-Chairman for Lower Egypt will continue to serve
at all times and on a full-time basis.
5.02      In charge of procurement is the Administration and Finance Depart-
ment of EPADP. An ad hoc committee composed of the Chairman, the responsible
regional Vice-Chairman and the head of the Technical Office of EPADP approves
specifications prepared by the design office. It also evaluates bids and
makes recommendations for contract awards.
5.03      Required data on crop yields will be collected by the Ministry of
Agriculture which also will carry out soil studies and conduct reclamation
work on saline lands. Effective participation of the Extension Service of
the Ministry of Agriculture in the drainage program is essential. It is the
responsibility of the Extension Service to instruct farmers in operating the
drainage system, to assure their cooperation with the drainage maintenance
units, and to adopt efficient irrigation practices. For this purpose coor-
dination committees with representatives of the Ministry of Irrigation,
Ministry of Agriculture and EPADP have been established. Among other func-
tions these committees will formulate plans for joint activities and initiate
programs to train extension personnel in all aspects of field drainge (Annex
4). During negotiations, assurances have been obtained that all measures
necessary will be taken to provide adequate coordination between the Extension
Service and EPADP at national, governorate and district levels.
Supervision of the Bilharzia Control Program
5.04      The Ministry of Health will be responsible for planning, executing,
and supervising the Bilharzia control program. This new program will be an
extension of the ongoing programs, financed under the Upper Egypt Drainage I
and II Projects. It would be operated in the same manner and under the same



- 24 -
management as the ongoing programs. The application of molluscicide will
be carried out by Snail Control centers and units of the Ministry of Health.
These applications would be based upon synoptic data on canal discharge pro-
vided by the Ministry of Irrigation. Bioassay monitoring of treated waters
and analysis of water samples for active molluscicide would be undertaken
by the Snail Control centers and units. The chemotherapeutic treatment and
follow-up of all infected persons will be carried out by qualified personnel
of the Ministry of Health at health centers and units throughout the area,
using an oral drug, acceptable to the Ministry and IDA/Bank. The Ministry
of Health will prepare and submit to IDA and the Bank a Plan of Operation for
the Bilharzia Control Program which will stipulate the implementation and
technical supervision of the snail control program and the chemotherapeutical
treatment of the infected persons. A special assessment unit established by
the Ministry of Health, will have the responsibility for the supervision and
evaluation of the Bilharzia control program. At all times the Ministry of
Health will employ an adequately qualified and experienced program director.
After the completion of the IDA/Bank financed Bilharzia control program the
Ministry of Health will on a continuing basis review the effectiveness of this
program and will take whenever necessary the required action to ensure the
continuity of the Bilharzia control measures beyond the implementation period
of the previous and present projects. Assurances to all the above have been
obtained during negotiations.
Operation and Maintenance of Drainage Works
5.05      As in previous drainage projects, the contractors will be respon-
sible for the maintenance of the pumping stations until final acceptance by
EPADP, which normally occurs one year after completion. Following acceptance,
the stations will be handed over to the maintenance department of the Ministry
of Irrigation. Maintenance of open drains will be the responsibility of the
same department. Field drainage works will be maintained for one year after
completion by the contractors. After formal acceptance by EPADP, field
drainage works will be maintained by special field drainage maintenance units
to be established under the project. These units will be equipped with
flushing pumps, water tanks, hoses and other necessary equipment. Assurances
have been obtained during negotiations that EPADP will establish such special
field drainage maintenance units in the project area and that the necessary
funds, staff, equipment and transportation facilities will be provided.
Details on the operation and maintenance costs are given in Annex 6.
Staff Requirements and Training
5.06      Project implementation would require strengthening of the tech-
nical services of EPADP. It is estimated that about an additional 100 civil
engineers, 20 mechanical and electrical engineers and 200 technicians-super-
visors will be required by 1979 for the proposed project. These engineers
and technicians are required for planning, designing and supervising project
construction. It is anticipated that a number of engineers will be made



- 25 -
available to EPADP from engineers who are now serving in the army and are
already on EPADP's payroll. Technicians-supervisors will be recruited from
among graduates of the Technical Institute for Survey. This institute,
recently established, admits high school graduates and its two years curri-
culum includes extensive practical training. About 100 technicians were
graduated in 1976 and an equal number is expected to be graduated annually
in the future. After a short period of on-the-job training in EPADP these
technicians could replace engineers in the supervision of field drainage
installation. In order to attract and retain qualified and experienced per-
sonnel, special allowances plus an annual bonus will be paid as in previous
drainage projects. Assurances to this effect have been obtained during
negotiations. In view of this, it is not anticipated that a shortage of
qualified personnel will develop during project implementation.
5.07      To train engineers and technicians of the project in field drainage
practices, and operators and mechanics in the proper operation and maintenance
of the project equipment, EPADP will implement a training program, at its
existing training center. Instructors for the training courses will comprise
experienced Egyptian engineers, consultants to EPADP and contractors' personnel.
Assurances to this effect have been obtained during negotiations. No funds
are provided under the proposed project for training abroad, as several
bilateral aid programs provide finance for this purpose.
Cost Recovery
5.08      Substantial amounts of project investment and maintenance costs
will be recovered from project beneficiaries. Law 74 of 1971 regulates the
recovery of costs incurred in the installation of field drainage works. The
law stipulates that actual investment costs of field drainage, plus a 10%
administrative charge, are to be recovered from the beneficiaries. Payments
to that effect are to be made over a 20-year period, commencing not later than
12 months after completion of the works. Assurances to this effect have been
obtained during negotiations. For the proposed project, field drainage invest-
ment costs have been calculated at about BE 100 per feddan including a 10%
administrative charge.l/ Based on such payments a total of bE 41.6 million
would be recovered and the cost recovery ratio would be 100%. The benefit
recovery ratio, defined as the ratio of the present worth of the stream of
direct government revenues from cost recovery charges divided by the present
worth of the stream of incremental farm income, discounted at 10%, would be
less than 10%, which is favorable.
5.09      The above mentioned Law does not however contain any provision for
direct charges to be paid for maintenance of field drainage works. In the
past these costs were considered to be recovered as part of the reassessed
land tax following the completion of field drainage systems. For the majority
1/   The foreign exchange component has been calculated at the parallel
market rate.



- 26 -
of the farming community in the project area this basis for paying the main-
tenance costs was removed in 1973 when Law 51 exempted all holdings of less
than three feddans from paying land tax. In order to continue the recovery of
field drainage maintenance costs, a Ministerial Decree has been issued to that
effect. According to this Decree, the maintenance cost of field drainage will
be calculated at the end of each fiscal year on the basis of costs actually
incurred. This decree will also apply to the previous IDA/Bank financed drain-
age projects. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
It is not expected that the total cost recovery (investment and maintenance
costs) would result in a benefit recovery ratio of more than 12% which still
is favorable. Details on cost recovery are given in Annex 10.
5.10      For the 400,000 feddans to be equipped with field drainage a recovery
ratio of all costs, namely 100% of investment and maintenance cost per field
drainage plus a share of 40% of all investment costs for pumping stations,
remodelling of open drains including structures and 40% of the related opera-
tion and maintenance cost has been calculated. The net present value of these
costs excluding price contingencies discounted at 10% amounts to bE 53 million
of which a net present value of BE 14 million or 26% would be recovered over
the 30 year life of the project. Taken the small size of the majority of the
farm which is on average 3.4 feddans this total cost recovery ratio is con-
sidered satisfactory.
5.11      During negotiations of the Upper Egypt Drainage II Project it was
agreed that EPADP conducts a socio-economic study within that project area to
determine the ability of beneficiaries to pay for the full costs of the field
drainage investments, including the opportunity cost of capital for which
farmers presently are not charged. This study will be extended to include the
area of the present project and it will be completed before June 30, 1978.
The Government will implement the recommendations emanating from this study in
consultation with IDA/Bank. Assurances to the above have been obtained during
negotiations.
Accounts and Audit
5.12      A cost-accounting system established by EPADP for the previous IDA/
Bank financed drainage projects is now being implemented. During negotiations
an assurance has been obtained that EPADP will continue to maintain this cost-
accounting system.
5.13      EPADP will establish and maintain separate accounts to adequately
reflect the expenditures for project implementation. Assurances to this
effect have been obtained during negotiations.
5.14      EPADP's accounts will be audited annually by an independent auditor
acceptable to IDA/Bank. Copies of audit reports in English will be submitted
by EPADP to IDA and the Bank for each fiscal year within six months after the
end of each year. Assurances to this effect have been obtained during nego-
tiations.

VI. PRODUCTION, MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, CROPS AND FARM INCOME
Cropped Area, Yields and Production
6.01      On the 400,000 feddans, which will be provided with field drainage,
the decline in yields will be prevented and increases in yields will be
expected. Data on the present and projected cropped area, yields and annual
production for this area are presented in the table below:
Yields            Production       Increase in
Cropped Area        m tons/Fed        (000) m tons       Production

Maize              102.6      1.75      2.19      180.0    224.7       44.7       25
Wheat               94.3      1.49      1.76      140.5    166.0       25.5       18
Total         419.3
Details of average present yields and production on the areas to be field-
drained are found in Annex 4, Tables I and 2. On the remaining 600,000
feddans, it is anticipated that the influence of the installation of pumping
stations and the remodelling of open drains will prevent the decline in yields
that would otherwise occur. This decline in yields is estimated at 30% of the
present yields over a period of 35 years.  In addition, the deepening of open
drains to a depth of over 2.5 meters will provide good drainage conditions,
equivalent to those of field drainage, on a strip of land of about 50 m wide
on both sides of the open drains. Since the open drains are spaced about
2000 m, it is assumed that 5% of the area of 600,000 feddans, i.e. 30,000
feddans, will receive the full benefits of field drainage. The summary of the
estimated present and projected cropped area, yields and annual production for
the 30,000 feddans are found in the table below:
Yields            Production       Increase in

Total      31.3
Details on estimated present production and yields on the 30,000 feddans are
found in Annex 4, Table 3.



- 28 -
6.02       To ascertain the influence of field drainage on reducing waterlogging
and salinity, and thereby increasing yields, a number of experiments and re-
ports on yield responses in farmers' fields have been reviewed. In all cases,
yields have increased due to field drainage, but the magnitude of this increase
varies with the crop, yield level before drainage was installed, location, and
other factors (Annex 4, paras 11 and 12). As a result of reviewing the data
available and field observations, conservative increases in yield were used to
determine the benefits from the project. Yield increases are expected to be
20% for cotton, 12% for rice, 25% for maize and 18% for wheat. It is assumed
that hybrid maize will be used in the project and that the extension program
will assist farmers to improve their irrigation and cultural practices par-
ticularly with cotton and maize. These increases are not expected to be
realized until 3 years after installation of field drainage. Expected yield
increases are assumed to built up as follows: 40% in the first year, 30% in
the second year and 30% in the third year.
6.03      The direct effect of field drainage on crop yields and soil proper-
ties will be better known after completion of the evaluation studies which
were initiated under the ongoing drainage projects. A complete evaluation
report for the first drainage project (Nile Delta Drainage I) will be sub-
mitted to IDA/Bank not later than June 30, 1978. The monitoring system for
the proposed project will be initiated after installation of field drainage
in the first catchment area and the evaluation report will be submitted to
IDA/Bank not later than June 30, 1984. Assurances on the above have been
obtained during negotiations.
Market and Prices
6.04      Egypt today is faced with decreasing foreign exchange earnings from
traditional export crops and increasing food import bills for its fast grow-
ing population. Therefore no problems are foreseen in absorbing incremental
outputs of various crops produced in the project area (details are shown
in Annex 8). Wheat imports, alone between 1974 and 1975 rose by 24%. Any
additional wheat production will substitute for even larger expected imports.
Increases in cotton production will be readily absorbed both on the export
market, where Egyptian cotton has a high reputation, and for domestic textile
manufacture, which has taken up an increasing proportion of cotton output
in recent years. Additional maize will also substitute for steeply rising
imports. As domestic consumption of rice is steadily rising the value of
export is declining. The incremental rice production in the project area will
help to restore previous export earning levels. Additional outputs of other
crops effected by the project will be readily absorbed locally, with some
vegetables adding marginally to exports. The present storage, processing and
transportation facilities are expected to handle the forecasted increased
production without imposing serious problems.
6.05      Egypt has a system of parallel markets for most of its major crops.
For the public marketing outlets prices are Government controlled and are
generally significantly below prices paid on international markets. For the
economic analysis of this project administered prices are adjusted according



- 29 -
to projections provided by the Bank's Economic Analysis and Projections
Department, valued at the parallel market rate of LE 1 = US$1.5 (Annex 11,
Table 2). Prices used in the financial analysis for farm inputs and outputs
are based on current farm-gate prices received in the project area.
Producer Income
6.06      Full development of any individual farm holding is expected to
be reached about three years after installation of field drainage. On a 1
feddan tenant operated non-rice growing farm, annual net return will increase
at full development from LE 112 to LE 135. Without the project the annual
net return would drop to LE 94 in about year 10, due to the increasing effects
of waterlogging and salinity. Compared to the without project situation in
year 10, the annual net return will increase by almost 44%. In the case of a
3 feddans non-rice growing farm, operated by the owner, the annual net return
will increase from LE 389 to LE 472. Compared with the without project situa-
tion in year 10, the annual net return will have increased by 42%, as the
return by then would have dropped to bE 332. Illustrative farm budgets for
three farm models are presented in Annex 9.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Benefits from Drainage Works
7.01      At full project development, which is expected to be achieved in
year 9, the project will give rise to an annual incremental stream of net
benefits valued at LE 21.8 million (US$32.7 million). This represents in-
creased crop production on 400,000 feddans benefiting from field drainage
(LE 12.67 million per annum) and on the 30,000 feddans (LE 0.95 million per
annum) located along both sides of the remodelled open drains. In addition,
the project will prevent the decline of crop yields on 570,000 feddans which
would otherwise drop at least 30% over the next 35 years.  The net annual
economic value of this prevented decline which can be claimed as a benefit
for the project, is estimated to be LE 8.2 million (US$12.3 million) by year
9. However, by year 35, which will be the life of the project, this would
have increased to LE 34.5 million (US$51.7 million). Details are given in
Annex 11.
7.02      Based on the above benefits and a 35-year project life, the economic
rate of return is estimated to be 23%, using the parallel market rate for for-
eign exchange. This rate of return is based on conservative assumptions as
incremental production and prevented yield decreases of only the major food
and export crops, wheat, maize, rice, and cotton have been included in the
calculation. Additional benefits are certain to accrue from incremental pro-
duction and prevented yield decreases of vegetables, fruits, and berseem,
the yields of which are expected to react to improved drainage similarly as
the mentioned major crops. The rate of return is comparatively high due to
the nature of the project which is in actual fact an exercise in restoring



- 30 -
the productive capacity of existing farmland and at the same time in preventing
its productive decline. The rate of return has been tested against adverse
developments affecting production and investment costs. Thus, with a cost
increase of 25% and a simultaneous decrease in production of 25%, the project
would still yield a rate of return of 15.3% (Annex 11).
7.03      During the five-year implementation period the project will create
demand for labor totaling 58,000 man-years. From year 6 onwards the annual
labor demand for operation and maintenance will be 2,310 man-years. At full
development, seasonal on-farm labor requirements will be increased by 8% or
1.5 million man-days annually. This additional on-farm labor will mainly be
required during harvest periods which, however, due to multiple cropping,
will be spread over the year.
Beneficiaries from Drainage Works
7.04      A total of 295,000 farm families or about 1.6 million people are
expected to benefit from the project mainly occupying small farms. Based on
the three farm models, used to calculate the benefits of the project, present
farm incomes, after deduction of taxes and charges, vary between BE 112 for
a 1 feddan tenant operated non-rice growing farm and BE 438 for a 3 feddans
owner operated rice growing farm. Without the project these incomes would
decline to LE 94.3 and BE 332 respectively by year 10. The relative poverty
level in rural areas in Egypt is estimated to be about BE 60 per capita. The
income of more than 50% of the farming population in the project area is es-
timated to be less than this level. With the project, farm incomes will
increase to BE 135, for the one feddan holding and to LE 472 for the three
feddans holding. Actual increases in farm incomes will be higher than the
farm models indicate, because of the unaccounted increases in yields of
fruits, vegetables and berseem. Moreover, increases in income do not quite
reflect the real impact of the project because, as indicated above, without
the project, incomes will decline below the already submarginal level.
Benefits from Bilharzia Control
7.05      The proposed control measures aimed at reducing transmission of
Bilharzia in the area between Asyut and Aswan will complete the current
Bilharzia control programs in Upper Egypt. The population in the area
covered by the proposed project is about 5 million people of which some 25%
are presently infected with Bilharzia. It should be mentioned that during the
next 3 years the population in that area would increase by circa 540,000 and
in the absence of any effective control measures, approximately 135,000 new
cases of schistosomiasis would occur. Not only will the project prevent an
increase in the number of people suffering from this severe, dibilitative
disease but it will help to cure those already infected and reduce Bilharzia
related morbidity.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following principal
points:
(a) contracts for the purchase of goods and for civil works for
pumping stations and for field drainage with PVC pipes will
be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with IDA/Bank guidelines (paras 4.21 and 4.23);
(b) the Government will take all measures necessary to provide
adequate coordination between the Extension Service of the
Ministry of Agriculture and EPADP and will maintain the
coordination committees established at national, gover-
norate and district levels (para 5.03);
(c) the Ministry of Health will prepare a plan acceptable to
IDA/Bank for operation of the Bilharzia control program
under the proposed project (para 5.04);
(d) the Ministry of Health, after the completion of the Bilharzia
control program, will review on a continuing basis the effec-
tiveness of the program and will take the required action to
ensure the continuity of the Bilharzia control measures
(para 5.04);
(e) EPADP will establish special field drainage maintenance units
in the project area and will provide them with the necessary
funds, staff, equipment and transportation facilities for the
maintenance of field drainage works (para 5.05);
(f) the Government will make suitable arrangements to ensure the
recovery from the beneficiaries of the present and previous
IDA/Bank financed drainage projects of: (i) the capital
costs of installing field drainage, plus a 10% administrative
charge, by annual installments over a period of no more than
20 years; and (ii) the maintenance cost of field drainage works
calculated at the end of each fiscal year on the basis of total
costs actually incurred by the field drainage maintenance units
(paras 5.08 and 5.09);
(g) EPADP will complete the socio-economic study to determine the
ability of beneficiaries to pay for full cost of field drainage
investment before June 30, 1978 and the Government will imple-
ment the recommendations of this study in consultation with
IDA/Bank (para 5.11);
(h) the monitoring of the effect of field drainage works on crop
yields and soil properties under the proposed project will be
initiated immediately after installation of field drainage



- 32 -
in the first catchment area. A complete evaluation report will
be submitted to IDA/Bank not later than June 30, 1984 (para
6.03).
Special Condition
8.02      The failure of the agreement with the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
(KfW) of the Federal Republic of Germany becoming effective by December 31,
1977 or by another date to be agreed upon between the Government and IDA/Bank,
will be a condition of default unless the Government will be able to secure
the additional funds required from other sources (para 4.17).
Condition of Effectiveness of the Credit and Loans
8.03      The Government will establish a "special fund" for the previous and
proposed IDA/Bank financed drainage projects, for timely allocations of local
funds (para 4.20).
8.04      The project is technically feasible, economically sound and finan-
cially viable. Having received the necessary assurances, the project is
suitable for an IDA credit of US$27 million on standard terms, a Bank loan
of US$27 million for a term of 20 years, including 4-1/2 years grace period
with interest at 8.2% and a Third Window Loan of US$12 million with first
repayment date January 15, 1983 and final maturity date January 15, 2001 at
4-1/2% interest. The borrower will be the Arab Republic of Egypt.

APPRAISAL OF
NILE DELTA DRAINAGE II PROJECT
ARAB RPEUBLIC OF EGYPT
Climatological Data
General
1.        The entire country of Egypt lies in the temperate zone between 220
and 320 north latitude. It is part of the vast desert belt which extends in
Northern Africa from the Atlantic Coast eastward through Saudi Arabia. The
country as a whole is dry and arid with sub-tropical temperatures prevailing
throughout the land. The Nile, flowing from the southern region to the
M-editerranean, forms the ribbon of life for the country. People and crops
are confined to the eastern and western side of this strip of water. The
Nile below Cairo travels on a north-westerly course and at approximately 20
kilometers downstream divides into two branches: The Rosetta Branch flows
westward, for about 239 kilometers and the Damietta Branch eastward, for about
245 kilometers before each empties into the Mediterranean. Those areas west
of the Rosetta Branch are in West Delta, those east of the Damietta Branch are
in east Delta and the region between the two branches is the Central Delta.
The project site is located in the East, Central and West Delta.
Rainfall
2.        Annual rainfall tends to decrease inland from approximately 187 mm
at Alexandria (Table 1), to about 46 mm at Tanta (Table 2), located at the
center of the project, to around 26 mm at Cairo. At the research station in
Sakha, Kafr El Sheikh, situated at the northernmost tip of the project, the
average annual total rainfall is 78.5 mm (Table 3). Most of the rain occurs
during the winter months, November through March. Rainfall, however, is of
little consequence in the project area and crop production depends totally on
irrigation.
Temperatures
3.        The annual mean maximum, minimum and average temperatures are
respectively 27.20C, 12.80C, and 20.70C for Tanta (Table 2), and 29.10C,
13.20C and 19.20C for Sakha (Table 3). During the summer period, May through
September, the average monthly temperature in the project area seldom rises
above 34.50C or falls below 140C. During the winter, the monthly maximum
temperatures range from 260C in November to 200C in February. In this same
period, the monthly minimum temperatures range from around 120C in November
to a low of 60C in January and February.

Relative Humidity
4.        The mean annual relative humidity is lowest around the coast, 68.8%
at Alexandria and tends to increase inland being 70.5% at Sakha and 74.7% at
Tanta. At Sakha, the lowest relative humidity is in March (64%) and the
highest in July (76%). At Tanta, the lowest period of relative humidity
occurs in June being 63% and the highest in November and December amounting 82%.
Crop Influence
5.        The temperate climate of the Delta with hot and warm days and rela-
tively cool nights favors plant growth when moisture in deficit or excess is
not a limiting factor. Crops such as potatoes, cabbage, wheat and beans
thrive in the winter, while the hot summer period is favorable for cotton and
rice, the major export crops, and maize. The climate also promotes the growth
throughout the year of perennial and annual temperate and semi-tropical crops
such as oranges, grapes, bananas, mangoes and tomatoes.

APPRAISAL OF
NILE DELTA DRAINAGE II PROJECT
ARAB RPEUBLIC OF EGYPT
Soils and Needs for Drainage
General
1.        The soils in the project area are recent alluvium, formed from
suspended matter brought down by the Nile flood from the hills and the plateau
of Ethiopia. The soils are typical heavy deltaic alluviums (a complex pattern
of silts and clays), with an average depth of 9-10 m, that overlie deposits of
waterbearing coarse sands and gravels. The complexity of the alluvium is due
to the way in which it was deposited. The Delta has been cut up and reestab-
lished many times. During the Roman period, seven branches of the river
traversed the Delta whereas today there are only two branches.
Soils Types
2.        The soils in the southern part of the Delta are homogenous clays,
while in the north they become heterogenous, with the comparatively lighter
soils alternating with heavy clays. A compressed, impervious peat layer
exists at a depth of about 6 m in the north of the Delta. Most of the soils
in the central part of the project are dark to very dark brown clays ranging
from light to heavy in texture, throughout the profile. There are patches of
soils, particularly in catchment area XIII, (IBRD Map 12596) with dark brown
clay loams to sandy loams with occasional sandy layers in the subsoil (levee
formations). In the western part of the project, catchment areas OW3 and OW4,
the yellow sandy soils are of desert plains origin. In the southern part of
catchment area OW 2 pale yellow calcareous soils occur and in the central part
of the same catchment area the soils are of marine alluvium comprising dark
brown clay loams and clays to a depth of 50-120 cm, overlying marine shells
with layers of bluish sand and clay. In the eastern part of the project,
(catchment areas OE6, OE4 and OE11) in addition to the soils of recent allu-
vium, there are patches of grey or pale brown sandy sub-deltic deposits. They
have occasional dark brown sandy loam to clay loams in the surface layer.
3.        The Soil Survey Department of the Ministry of Agriculture has con-
ducted a soil classification of the cultivated lands of Egypt and maps are
available showing soil texture, drainage classes, depth of water-table and
salinity. However, depth of water table and salinity vary over time and data
on these features hold true only for the period of the survey.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
Texture
4.        In general, the Delta soils are fine textured, medium heavy to
heavy clays. In the southern part of the project area, the surface one meter
of soil consists of 75-85% of fine silt and clay, and 25-15% of very fine sand
with very little coarse sand. In the northern part of the area, the clay
content increases. In the west, sandy soils dominate the profile. In the
east, there are patches of sandy loam to clay loam in the surface layers.
Near the edges of the desert, on the east and west sides of the Delta, the
texture of the soils become coarser.
Structure
5.        The structure of the heavy Nile alluvium is sub-angular, blocky in
the arable layer. The clay fraction is primarily montmorillonite and kaolinite
and these types of clays are responsible for the high cation exchange capacity
found in most of the soils. Also because of the nature of the clay fraction,
the soils, when saturated, often become structureless and, when dry, extremely
hard.
Permeability
6.        The permeabilty of the soil varies from less than 0.1 m per day in
most of the heavy soils, to 0.5 m per day or sometimes considerably more in
the lighter soils. Some very sandy profiles may have a permeability of
several meters per day. As a guideline, the following simplified relationship
may be taken; with clay percentages over 50, between 40-50, between 30-40 and
less than 25, the average permeabilities would be 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5, and 1
meter per day respectively. In homogenous clay profiles, the permeability
tends to decrease with depth. In the arable layer and in the root zone values
of 2 m per day have been measured occasionaly, which decrease rather abruptly
to values below 0.10 m per day at depths greater than 1 m.
Salinity and Alkali Conditions
7.        Very little detailed information on salinity throughout the project
area is available. The land classification maps of the Delta, completed by
the Soil Survey Department Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, shows
the presence of four salinity groups namely:
(a) Non-saline soils, less than 4 mmhos/cm
(b) Moderately saline soils, 4-8 mmhos/cm
(c) Highly saline soils, 8-16 mmhos/cm
(d) Very highly saline soils, more than 16 mmhos/cm
The surveys on which the maps for the project area have been based were carried
out over a period of about six years. When comparing the degree of salinity
between areas, care has to be taken, due to this time lapse and the continuing
increase in salinity of the Delta. The maps, however, clearly show that
the southern part of the project area is much less saline than the northern



ANNEX 2
Page 3
section. Also, that in the east, catchment areas OE4 and OE5, there are many
areas with moderately high and very highly saline soils. In the west, the
same is true for catchment areas OW2 and OW3 but to a lesser degree in OW4.
There are very few areas that are likely to need more than leaching and
drainage to improve their productive potential. The Soil Survey Department
considers that alkali soils exist in only 5-10% of the land in the Delta.
No serious problem with alkali soils is expected in the project area.
8.        Desalinization of the top 0.5 m of the saline soils in the project
area is expected to take 3 to 4 years, with most rapid leaching taking place
immediately following the completion of the drainage facilities. In some
very saline areas, desalinization will take more than 4 years. The proposed
drainage system for the project, based on experience from Nile Delta I
Drainage Project, will provide conditions whereby all crops can be grown
without any depression of yield due to salinity or inadequate drainage.
Drainage in the Delta
9.        Because the slope to the sea is only 7.7 cm per km, natural drainage
under the best of circumstances in the Delta is very slow, even though the
soils have a thick base of permeable sands and gravel. Since 1847 the river
water level at the Delta apex has been raised as a result of the construction
of the Cairo Barrage which allowed more water to flow into the canals. This
raising of the water level at the barrage has caused a rise in the water table
in the Delta. Data of monitored wells in the neighborhood of Cairo from as far
back as 1894 to 1950 show water levels 1 km from the river to have risen from
14.29 meter above sea level to 16.80 meters. It is strongly believed that
water table levels throughout most of the Delta have risen as a result of the
erection and increasing the height of the barrage pond and of the high level
canals built to carry the diverted water.
10.       Following the introduction of controlled perennial irrigation, the
increase in total quantity of irrigation water diverted and applied annually
resulted in a parallel increase in the need for drainage water to be removed
from the area. Although the irrigated lands are underlain at depth by a very
permeable strata, the overlying soil horizons are of comparatively low per-
meability, and give rise to a rather complex natural drainage system. The
capacity of the artificial drainage system provided in the Delta in the past
has been insufficient to prevent disequilibrium arising in the groundwater
aquifer. The minimum water table level in all areas of the project are
influenced by seepage water from canals, by surface irrigation all of which is
superimposed on a foundation of mass underground infiltration from the barrage
pond at the apex of the Delta.
11.       In the project site, in those areas not at present equipped with
field drains, the natural drainage process has not been able to function to
the degree desired resulting in a seasonal rise of the water in the winter
often to within 60 cm from the surface. This is especially true since farmers
tend to put more water on the land than is necessary. In mid-summer the evapo-
transpiration rate is such that throughout most of the Delta, except where



ANNEX 2
Page 4
rice is being cultivated, the soil moisture level is reduced below saturation
point, down to a depth of approximately 1.50 m below the surface, except
during the two or three days after irrigation. Depending upon the permea-
bility of the soil, the water table is at an average depth which is satisfac-
tory for most crops in midsummer. In early and late summer, however, the
water table in inadequately drained areas is at intermediate depths which are
too shallow for the optimum development of the rooting system of cotton and
maize. In the rice growing areas the fields are inadequately drained when
there is only a simple surface drainage system in existence without any
appreciable subsurface drainage flow. It was pointed out in the appraisal of
Nile Delta I Drainage Project that the rice crop benefits from sub-surface
drainage and leaching resulting from the installation of field drains, and
that yield increases of up to 25% were obtained. Field drains were beneficial
because they removed accumulated toxic elements and improved aeration in the
root zone. In the imperfectly drained areas, salts tend to build up in the
surface because of the rise of the saline groundwater, due to overirrigation.
Thus in those areas which are imperfectly drained, crop yields are 30 to 50%
below those on better drained lands that are non-saline or only moderately
saline (see Annex 4, Table 8).
12.       Recently, because of the difference in water requirements of rice
and cotton, some problems have been encountered when these crops are grown
near each other and share the same drainage outlets. Rice requires flooding
and periodic drainage whereas cotton requires free drainage at all stages
of growth. EPADP is giving the problem careful attention and believes that
planting of cotton and rice in large blocks, each with different drainage
outlets, would resolve the problem.
Drainage and Salinity
13.       Measurements of soil salinity carried out in the top 1.0 m of soil
profile before (1971-72) the execution of field drainage in four catchment
areas of the Nile Delta I Drainage Project, compared with measurements in
January 1976 after installation of drains, showed field drains to be very
effective in the reduction of salinity. All areas which were moderately to
highly saline had their salinity status changed to a non-saline condition
within three years, as shown in the table below:

14.       Recently published experimental data 1/ on the effect of subsurface
drainage in the Delta on salt removal from cultivated land showed that, after
one year of cropping 70 feddans, each feddan on average lost 3.0 tons of
soluble salts in the top 20 cms. Evidence is also presented to show that
in clay loam saline areas with salt content greater than 0.33%, salinity had
nearly disappeared, one year after the installation of drainage, by cropping
clover and rice.

APPRAISAL OF
NILE DELTA DRAINAGE II PROJECT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Project Drainage Works
General
1.        The project drainage works, described below, will affect an area
of approximately 1,000,000 feddans and will include:
(a) construction of four new pumping stations required to lift the
drainage effluent in low-lying areas for discharge into main
drains, canals or directly into the Nile; construction of 19 km
of electric transmission lines to connect the stations to the
national grid;
(b) replacement of ten obsolete pumping units in two existing drain-
age stations;
(c) deepening and widening (remodelling) of 1,565 km of existing
open main and branch drains serving an area of 810,000 feddans;
extension or reconstruction of existing structures (bridges,
culverts, syphons; etc.) in these drains; and
(d) installation of covered field drains and pipe collectors on
400,000 feddans of the project area.
2.        The project in addition will provide vehicles and equipment for
extension service, and training and office equipment. Table 1 shows the area
that will be affected by the project drainage works. Map IBRD 12596 shows the
total project area, the location of the existing and new pumping stations and
the areas to be provided with field drainage.
Pumping Stations
3.        The effluent from the buried collectors and open drains will either
be discharged by gravity or lifted by pumps where necessary. There are seven
drainage pumping stations in the project area, serving an area of 484,000
feddans. Two of them, serving an area of 193,000 feddans, were constructed
in 1954 and their pump units are becoming obsolete. The replacement of these
units, ten in total, is included in the project. The remaining five of the
existing pumping stations have been constructed in recent years and they are
in good condition.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
4.        Four additional new pumping stations will be required to ensure
an adequate water level in the open dra -            he four  rumping stations which
will serve 118,000 feddans in total will together have 14 electrically
driven pump units of which 4 (one per station) will be standby units. Power
transmission lines 11 KV, of a total length of 19 km, will connect the new
pumping stations to the national grid. The discharge capacities of the elec-
trically driven pump units will vary from 1 to 5 m3/sec and the operating
heads between 0.60 to 4.50 m.
5.        With the existing and the proposed pumping stations, a total area
of about 600,000 feddans will be served. The drainage effluent from the
remaining area of approximately 400,000 feddans will be discharged by gravity
to the Nile or to existing main drains.
6.        The technical characteristics of the existing and new pumping
stations are given in Table 2.
Remodelling of Open Drains
7.        The existing network of open main and branch drains was designed to
keep the water level in the drains at approximately 1.50 m below ground sur-
face. Experience during the last few decades showed that this water level is
inadequate to ensure good drainage conditions to the crops. In order to fur-
ther lower the groundwater and to provide free-fall discharge from the pipe
collectors of the tile drainage system, the open main and branch drains will
have to be widened and deepened to a water level of no less than 2.50 m below
ground surface. Existing bridges, syphons, flumes and other structures will
have to be either extended or rebuilt. It is estimated that on approximately
190,000 feddans of the project area, the existing open drains have sufficient
capacity and depth and do not need any widening or deepening. Therefore, the
remodelling of open drains will affect an area of 810,000 feddans. The total
length of drains which need remodelling is estimated to be 1,565 km and the
approximate volume of excavation 36 million m3. With the installation of new
pumping stations and the remodelling of open drains the decline in land
productivity would be prevented.
8.        For widening open drains the expropriation of approximately 10,000
feddans will be required. The average compensation that is expected to be
paid to the farmers by the Government is LE 800 per feddan. This land will
be lost for agriculture but in exchange, an area also estimated at 10,000
feddans, occupied now by tertiary open drains, will be made available for
cropping after installation of buried collectors. Therefore, the proposed
drainage works will not cause any reduction in the total cultivable land.
9.        Earth works for remodelling of open drains under the project will
not be financed by IDA/Bank. They will mainly be carried out by local public
sector contractors who have considerable experience in this type of work.
There are three large public sector (nationalized) contracting firms working
with excavation of open drains and irrigation canals in the Delta: (a) The
Egyptian Dragline Co.; (b) The Behera Co.; and (c) The Mechanical Excavation



ANNEX 3
Page 3
Co. The Ministry of Irrigation has made a five-year contract with these com-
panies for the execution of the work at fixed unit prices, with only a clause
for fuel price escalation. Unit prices for excavation have been determined
in the current contract at LE 0.235 per m3 for drains with a bed width of
more than 3.00 m and LE 0.355 to LE 0.400 per m3 for drains of smaller sec-
tions. The contracts expire at the end of 1977 and new contracts will be
signed in January 1978. Unit prices are expected to be increased by 30-50%.
10.       The annual requirements of the Ministry of Irrigation for excava-
tion work in Egypt are estimated at 40-50 million m3 of which approximately
2/3 are for drainage works and 1/3 for irrigation. During 1976, 93% of the
quantity of earth works was distributed among the above mentioned three
contracting firms according to their implementation capacity. The Egyptian
Dragline Co., established in 1885, is by far the most important. Their
share of work for 1976 was about 26 million m3, but they claim that their
capacity can be easily increased to 40 million m3 if they were provided with
additional equipment, spare parts and repair facilities (workshops). The
firm second in importance is the Mechanical Excavation Co., established by
the Ministry of Irrigation in 1975. The firm specializes in the excavation
of small section drains and in maintenance. Its share of the work in 1976
was about 10 million m3. The third firm, the Behera Company, is only operat-
ing in the Western part of the Delta, mainly in the Behera Governorate. Its
share of the work in 1976 was about 5 million m3. The performance of the
contracting firms in the execution of project works is satisfactory, in
spite of the fact that there is no competition.
11.       The equipment procured under the ongoing IDA/Bank financed drainage
projects has been distributed to the three contracting firms according to the
share of the total workload assigned to each firm. The terms of transfer of
the equipment to the contracting firms have been approved by IDA and the
Bank. For the execution of the work under the proposed project, 22 draglines
of 1 m3, 23 hydraulic excavators of 3/4 m3 together with other equipment and
spare parts will be provided under the project.
12.       The excavation and remodelling of small drains, for which the use
of equipment is not economical, is made by hand. This represents about 7%
of the total annual excavating volume. Contracts for the execution of the
work are awarded to private sector contractors after tendering. There is
a large number of private contractors specializing in this type of work in
each area, therefore competition is satisfactory.
13.       Structures to rebuild in open drains comprise bridges from 5 to
70 tons, flumes, culverts and syphons. According to statistical data, to
each 100 km of open drains correspond approximately 90 structures (0.9 struc-
tures per km) of a cost per structure varying from LE 2,000 to LE 20,000.
It is estimated that 1,400 structures will be required to be rebuilt under
the proposed project of a total estimated cost of LE 13 million of which
LE 5.2 million (US$7.8 million), representing indirect foreign exchange cost,
will be financed by IDA and the Bank. These structures, because of their
small size and the fact that they are scattered throughout the project area



ANNEX 3
Page 4
and planned to be implemented during the entire construction period, are not
suitable for international competition. Contracts for their construction will
be awarded to local contractors of private or public sector following local
procedures for tendering, which are satisfactory. Advertising is made in
local papers one month before the bidding date. Bids are evaluated and con-
tracts are awarded by special committees at the Governorate level if contracts
are less than LE 200,000 and by the Central Committee in Cairo if contracts
are more than LE 200,000. The competition is very satisfactory.
14.       Details on open drains works are shown in Table 3.  Maps IBRD 12597
and IBRD 12598 show the open drains to be remodeled.
Field Drainage
15.       Field drainage will be installed on 400,000 feddans of the project
area. The selection of this area was made on the basis of present drainage
conditions, giving priority to areas severely suffering from waterlogging.
The remaining area of 600,000 feddans will be provided with field drainage
at a later stage. With the installation of the field drainage systems it is
intended to reduce the water table to at least 1 m below the ground surface
within 48-72 hours following irrigation. To achieve this, field drains will
be installed at a minimum depth of 1.50 m at the point of their connection
with the collector. The slope of the field drains will vary between 10 to 20
cm per 100 m, depending on the topographical features of the area. To permit
installation of the field drains to this depth without further increase the
depth of the collector, the first field drains at the upstream part of the
collectors would have to be connected directly to the collector pipe at its
center line. The spacing of tile drains is calculated on the basis of physical
soil characteristics by using the Hooghoudt equation. The calculated values
are rounded to the nearest standard spacing adopted by EPADP, i.e. 40, 50 and
60m. The average length of field drains will be about 200 m and will discharge
into cement piped collectors which will evacuate the drainage water into the
main drains. The average length of the collectors will be 1.5 km, never
exceeding 2 km. The total length of field drains for the 400,000 feddans is
estimated to be 36,000 km and of the collectors 4,800 km. The areas to be
provided with field drainage are shown in maps IBRD 12597 and IBRD 12598 and
in Table 2.
16.       In order to ensure satisfactory maintenance of the covered drain-
age systems, manholes (inspection chambers) will be constructed in the pipe
collectors at an interval of about 180 m. The chamber bottom will be 30 cm
below the bottom of the lowest pipe entering the chamber to allow a margin
depth for sedimentation. Junction boxes for easy inspection and maintenance
will be used between field drains and collectors if the diameter of the col-
lector is larger than 30 cm. The upstream end of the collector pipes will be
extended up to the nearest irrigation canal in order to allow the use of water
from the canal for the flushing of the collectors. The downstream outlets of
the pipe collectors will consist of reinforced concrete pipes extended towards
the open drains. To avoid erosion of the banks at the point of the outlet,
the side slope of the drains will be protected with stone pitching. At the



ANNEX 3
Page 5
upstream end of each field drain a vertical flushing pipe with a concrete
block on the top will be constructed to allow flushing if sedimentation
occurs.
17.       Ninety percent of the area to be provided with field drains is
covered with field crops. In this area representing 360,000 feddans, PVC
corrugated pipes of 80 mm will be used for field drains. The pipes will be
manufactured locally in Egypt by imported pipe manufacturing plants. Two
plants of a capacity each of 1,000 m/hour of pipes would be required. The
raw material (resin powder) for the production of PVC pipes will also be
imported. It is estimated that the required quantity of raw material for
the production of PVC pipes for 360,000 feddans is 11,000 tons. The selec-
tion of PVC pipes was made because of the advantages they offer in comparison
to the cement pipes used in the past, namely, easy transportation, higher
output of pipe laying machines, due to the simplified logistics required,
and lower total cost. Assuming an average spacing of 50 m, the total length
of field drains with PVC pipes will be 32,400 km.
18.       The remaining 40,000 feddans of the area to be provided with field
drainage is cultivated with orchards. Because of the difficulty in using
machinery in densely planted orchards, the excavation of trenches, the laying
of pipes and the backfill will be done maually. In this case, cement pipes of
10 cm in diameter will be used for field drains. The total length of field
drains with cement pipes will be 3,600 km.
19.       For the collectors, cement pipes of a diameter varying from 15 to
40 cm will be used. Assuming an average of 12 m per feddan, the total length
of collectors for the 400,000 feddans will be 4,800,000 m.
20.       Under the Nile Delta Drainage I Project, three cement pipe making
plants have been installed for the production of pipes for field drains and
collectors. It is suggested that these plants be used after completion of
the Nile Delta Drainage I Project (December 1979) for the production of
cement pipes for collectors, for field drains for orchards and for maintenance
of field drains installed in the past. For this purpose, some modifications
will be required to the plants after completion of the Nile Delta Drainage I
Project in order to increase the production of larger diameter pipes and
reduce the production of pipes for field drains. These modifications consist
of the replacement of ten small machines for field drains by five large
machines for collector pipes. This arrangement will enable the pipe making
factories to work at full capacity up to the completion of the Nile Delta
Drainage II Project (December 1982). The five large machines will be provided
under the present project at an estimated cost of US$300,000 to be included
in the project, while the ten small machines could be sold. Table 4 shows the
annual requirements of cement pipes under the proposed project and for main-
tenance of previous drainage projects and Table 5 the breakdown in diameter
of the required collector pipes. Table 6 shows the present and suggested
capacity of the three cement pipe making factories.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
21.       A gravel envelope of approximately 5 cm thick will be placed
around all field drains. This will be done: (i) to prevent sediment from
flowing into the pipe drains; (ii) to provide adequate permeability for the
water to converge into the pipe drains without significant loss of head;
and (iii) to provide an additional discharge area around the pipe drains.
In order to obtain an envelope of approximately 5 cm thickness around the
pipe a quantity of 1.5 m3 of gravel should be used per feddan. The recom-
mended gradation of gravel is as follows:
Diameter of sieve openings:  2 mm   5 mm   10 mm   20 mm
Percent of gravel passing:   5%       50%    80%       100%
The only way to obtain this grade of gravel is by using crushers. Four gravel
crusher plants of a capacity of 25 m3/hour each will be provided under the
project. Because of the high cost of the gravel envelope, its general appli-
cation will be revised in light of the results from field tests to be carried
out in the ongoing projects.
22.       The responsibility for the installation of PVC pipe plants will
be under the supplier of the plants. In addition the suppliers will be
asked to provide experienced expatriate technicians for a period of three
years to assist the Government in the operation and maintenance of the plants
and for training local staff. The foreign exchange cost for the supply, in-
stallation and operation of the PVC plants and for the supplies of the raw
material for the production of pipes will be covered by the co-financier.
23.       The installation of the PVC pipes will be made by using trench lay-
ing machines, similar to those used for cement pipes in the ongoing drainage
projects. The average output of these machines with PVC pipes is expected to
be 1,800 m per day. Trenchless laying machines are not recommended because
the required depth of field drains (up to 1.80 m) combined with the soil con-
ditions in Egypt (mostly clay soils with high moisture content) raise doubts
as to the suitability of these machines. However, if field tests prove that
trenchless machines can be used in the Delta soils successfully and economi-
cally, contractors will be allowed to use this type of machine. Twenty-six
new pipe laying machines together with other equipment and spare parts (Annex
7) will be provided under the project. For the backfilling of field drains
and collector trenches four-wheel tractors with mount grader blades will be
used. Twenty of these tractors with spare parts will be provided under
the project.
24.       The contractors for the laying of PVC field drains and their col-
lectors will be selected through international competitive bidding, in
accordance with Bank Guidelines. The contractors who would participate in
the bidding will be invited to submit a list of new equipment they intend
to import into the country for the execution of the contract in accordance
with the construction schedule. This equipment, if approved by the Govern-
ment and IDA/Bank, will be procured by the contractors and imported under



ANNEX 3
Page 7
temporary exemption from import duties. The Government will advance to the
contractors the value of the equipment in the form of a mobilization award.
Upon completion of the contract the Government would have the option to buy
the used equipment if it is in acceptable condition, at prices calculated
on the basis of their residual value. In the event that the Government and
a contractor do not agree to an equipment transaction, the contractor could
either sell the equipment privately on the local market (in which case he
will be required to pay import duties, assessed on a prorata basis) or
remove the equipment from the country within six months after completion of
his contract. In all cases, contractors will be required to furnish expe-
rienced operators and mechanics to train Egyptian staff in the use and
maintenance of the imported equipment.
25.       Contracts for field drainage in orchards with manually installed
cement pipes will be awarded to local contractors of private or public
sector, following local procedures. These contracts are not suitable for
international competition since the average size of each contract would not
exceed 2,000 feddans, scattered in several locations, and the average cost
LE 120,000. There are 9 public sector and 15 private sector contractors
specialized in this type of work, therefore the competition is very satis-
factory. The same local procedures as for the tenders of structures in
open drains (para 13) will be followed. The cement pipes for field drainage
will be supplied to the contractors by the three existing tile making plants.
The total area of orchards to be provided with cement pipes under the pro-
posed project is 40,000 feddans and the estimated total cost LE 4.2 million
of which LE 0.84 million (US$1.30 million), representing indirect foreign
exchange cost, will be financed by IDA and the Bank.
26.       About 20 buildings (workshops, stores, offices, sheds, etc.) of an
average cost per building o' LE: 25,000, will be required by EPADP for the
implementation of the project and for the afterwards maintenance of drainage
works. Contracts for those buildings will also be awarded to local contractors
of the private sector followings local procedures. The total cost required is
about LE 0.5 million of which LE 0.2 million (US$0.3 million), representing
indirect foreign exchange cost, will be financed by IDA and the Bank.

NILE DELTA DRAINAGE II PROJECT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Agriculture
General
1.        The agricultural sector is extremely important in the life and
economy of Egypt. It provides employment opportunities for 46% of the popula-
tion, generates 31% of the GNP and is responsible for approximately 80% of the
export earnings.
2.        The Nile flowing northward creates two distinct agricultural regions:
the Nile Delta, an alluvial fan; and the Nile Valley, formed by alluvial soils
that were deposited annually on the flood plains of the east and west banks of
the Nile. In general, agriculture is mcre advanced in the Nile Delta than in
the Nile Valley. The project is located in the Mile Delta.
Crops and Seasons
3.        Due to its mild, temperate climate and available water, the Nile
Delta enjoys a year-round growing season. Traditionally, the agricultural
year begins in November and is divided into three periods: winter, summer
and "nili" (the fall season, named after the Nile flood). The major winter
crops are wheat, barley, Egyptian clover or berseem, broad beans, lentils,
winter vegetables, winter onions and potatoes. These crops are usually
planted during October through December and harvested from April through June.
The major summer crops are cotton, rice, maize, and summer vegetables. They
are generally planted from March through June and harvested from August to
November. The nili crops consist of maize and vegetables which are planted
in July and August, and harvested from October through December. An array of
fruits such as oranges and other citrus, mangoes, grapes and bananas are grown
in permanent groves. Dates are the second most important fruit after organges,
and date palms are found around villages and cultivated fields and along canals.
Rotations
4.        The general practice is a 2 or 3-year rotation.  In either case,
farming is intensive and the land usually supports a variety of crops through-
out the year giving a cropping intensity of approximately 190% in the project
area. The area devoted to cotton and rice are regulated by the government and
they tend to be farmed in relatively large consolidated blocks. This facili-
tates land preparation, water distribution, disease and insect control. The
other crops are cultivated in small plots.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
5.        A schematic layout for the 2 and 3-year rotations are presented
below. Clover, in association with cotton, is planted in the late fall and
after about two cuttings, no later than March, the cotton crop is planted.

Farm Practices
6.        Since the commissioning of the Aswan High Dam all farmers have
access to perennial irrigation. Farmers fields are provided with water
distributed through a vast network of irrigation public and private canals.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
Water is lifted from the main canals to the plots by traditional water wheels,
and to a lesser extent by motor pumps. Since there is no water charge to the
farmer, there is a tendency to over-irrigate.
7.        The major source of farm power is the buffalo and cattle.  They are
used for land preparation, threshing of grain, lifting of water and trans-
porting of goods and people. The donkey is very common and is used primarily
to transport goods and people. Sheep of the fat-tailed, coarse wool type,
and goats are found in the area, usually in herds controlled by nomads. They
roam from place to place grazing stubles. Sheep and goats' milk is used
primarily for making cheese and their meat is valued highly. The raw wool
produced is used mainly for making cloth and carpets. Pigeons are housed in
crude to sophisticated coops and provide a good income for raisers. Poultry
are common, securing their food by scavenging the homestead and nearby fields.
8.        Machinery is being used to an increasing extent in some agricultural
operations needing draft power such as plowing for cotton, pumping machines
for irrigation and motor sprayers for pest control on cotton.
9.        Organic manures and chemical fertilizers are used extensively and
farmers are fully aware of their benefits.
Agricultural Production
10.       The area, average yields and production of the major crops in the
project area are presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3. The data are given by
region, catchment area and district. The average weighted yields for the
major food crops in the project area in metric tons per feddan are 1.49 for
wheat, 0.30 for lint cotton, 2.30 for rice and 1.75 for maize. While there is
very little difference between the East and Middle Delta in respect to yields,
the West Delta region is particularly lower than the others where wheat and
cotton are concerned. All regions are large producers of food, especially
rice. About 28% of the land planted to major crops was devoted to cotton. In
some areas of the West Delta, such as in catchment area OW3, because of the
sandy nature of the soil, the farmers grow watermelons and maize instead of
cotton.
Responses to Drainage
II.       Yield responses to drainage have been studied by a number of govern-
ment agencies. A ten-year study (1942-52) by the Ministry of Irrigation
covering an area of 18,500 feddans in Menufiya Governorate gave an average
yield increase due to field drainage of 47% for maize and 48% for wheat.
Cotton data for that period was unreliable because of the effect of pests,
climate, variaties and other factors. Between 1949 to 1957 a joint research
program between the Ministry of Irrigation and the Faculty of Irrigation,
Alexandria University was undertaken. Their report showed increases in yield,
after two years of field drainage without fertilizers, to be 6% for cotton,
85% for maize and 47% for wheat. Yield increases were much higher in the



ANNEX 4
Page 4
fourth and eighth year after installation of drains for the mentioned crops
and substantially larger when fertilizers were applied (Tables 4, 5 and 6).
The UNSF/FAO team that conducted a drainage pilot project in the Delta (1961-
1964) reported that "the average yield increase due to field drainage can
safely be estimated at 10% and may be as high as 20%." During 1963 to 1968
the Drainage Research Bureau studied the influence of drainage on wheat yields
and reported increases due to drainage to be from 20 to 26% on average for the
period. In 1964 and 1968 a joint committee from the Ministries of Irrigation
and Agriculture was formed to evaluate crop response to drainage. Their
report, after reviewing all available information and data, indicated that
yield increases due to correction of poor drainage to be on the average of 35%
for cotton, 32% for maize and 27% for wheat.
12.       Recently the Soil and Water Research Institute, Agricultural Research
Center, Ministry of Agriculture established a permanent experiment to study
the influence of PVC and concrete field drains on the water table level and
yields of clover, cotton, wheat, rice and maize. The site is Mehallet Mousa
Farm in Kafr El-Sheik Governorate and the experiment is being conducted on
soil types representative of the Delta. Published data on clover showed
increases in yields of berseem over the first cutting to be for PVC pipes
106 to 114% and concrete pipes 89 to 99% (Table 7). In the third cut, the
yield increase over the first cut was 89 to 99% for PVC pipes and 79 to 97%
for concrete pipes. Although there were differences between the pipe mate-
rials in the increase in yields, these differences were reported to be not
statistically significant. The data for the other crops are to be published
the first part of 1977 but are reported to have increases that range from
26-92% for rice, 0.5 to 38% for wheat, 20-37% for maize and from 68% to over
100% for cotton, which had a base yield of 176 kg/fed of lint cotton. These
crops were planted in sequence in the same manner as done by farmers. The
Evaluation Committee of EPADP, reviewing field sample data on farmers' fields
totaling over 49,000 feddans in four catchment areas of the Nile Data I
Project, prepared a summary report. This report presents weighted average net
yield increases for the three crop years (1972/73-1974/75) after installation
of field drains, compared with yields in the same period outside project, to
be 14, 16 and 15% for wheat; 9, 5 and 7% for cotton; 14, 10, and 8% for maize;
and 3, 4 and 8% for rice. Unfortunately, samples were taken from different
farms inside and outside the project area each year and reflect all kinds
of conditions such as differences in management, soils, diseases, and other
unidentified situations and conditions. In the 26 districts which are sched-
uled for field drainage under the proposed project, the Ministry of Agriculture
reports that the average yields on those soils suffering from waterlogging and
salinity show as much as a 46% reduction in yield for maize, 50% for cotton
and wheat and 30% for rice, below the average yields on soils in the same
district which are not now seriously effected by waterlogging and salinity
(Table 8).



ANNEX 4
Page 5
13.       After a very careful review of available data  cited above on yield
increases in the Delta due to drainage and farmers' experience, modest in-
creases in yield at full development were taken to determine benefits from the
project. They were 20% for cotton, 12% for rice, 25% for maize and 18% for
wheat. However, it is expected that the yield increases on those severely
waterlogged and saline soils (Table 8) may be much higher.
14.       A monitoring and evaluation study, based on a new methodology is now
being prepared by the Evaluation Committee, in cooperation with the Dutch con-
sultants, to objectively evaluate the effects of drainage on the yields. The
study will involve the selection of representative areas in north and south
Egypt where crop yields over a timespan will be recorded before and after
the installation of field drains inside and outside the project area.
Information of the soil and physical and chemical properties as well as
environmental conditions such as plant diseases, weather and other pertinent
factors observed in these representative areas will also be recorded.
Agricultural Support Services
15.       Support to the farmer in the project area is through the Ministry
of Irrigation, EPADP and several agencies within the Ministry of Agriculture.
The Ministry of Irrigation supplies at specific intervals irrigation water for
the crops and maintains the irrigation canals. Also, this Ministry through
EPADP installs field drains, remodels and opens the main drains, erects the
pumping stations and controls the drainage canals. The most important agencies
in the Ministry of Agriculture serving the farmers in the project area are
the Egyptian General Organization for Agriculture and Cooperative Credit, the
Agricultural Cooperative Organization, the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative
Banks, the Agricultural Extension Service and the five agricultural research
stations at Giza, Bahteem, Neubaria, Sakha and Gemmeiza. These stations are
involved with the breeding and seed multiplication of superior, locally
adapted varieties of the major and some minor crops as well as research on
cultural practices. Great progress has been made in the breeding programs.
In addition to the regular agricultural extension agents, agricultural engi-
neers from departments other than the Extension Service attached to the office
of the Governor in each governorate serve as Extension Agents. There are
other services in the Department of Agriculture and Land Reclamation that
backstop the total agricultural program with direct and indirect support
to the farmers (Table 9). Additional credit facilities to the farmers are
expected to be available in the near future through village banks. To improve
the efficiency of the Extension Service and to facilitate the operation of
EPADP at the village level it has been proposed to EPADP and the Ministry of
Agriculture that (a) seminars be held for EPADP and Extension Personnel at the
governorate level to acquaint each other with their respective roles and to
explain how Extension could assist in the EPADP program; (b) coordination
committees, consisting of Extension and EPADP personnel, be established at
Cairo, each governorate and district level in which plans could be formulated
for fostering EPADP's program in each village; (c) a training program be
established to train Extension personnel in all aspects of the drainage



ANNEX 4
Page 6
program to enable the Extension Agents to communicate more effectively with
farmers; (d) the Extension Service collaborate with the maintenance units to
be established in EPADP to assure farmers' support and participation; and
(e) extension information material be developed specifically for the drainage
program. A strong effort should be made by the Extension Service to teach
farmers how to irrigate their fields more efficiently and to reduce overwater-
ing, an important factor contributing to the drainage problem.
16.       The Extension Service has been inefficient largely because of lack
of transportation, and inadequate training aids, especially those relating to
drainage. Insufficient staff is also an important factor. At present only a
limited number of villages have an Extension Agent, although there are plans
to have one agent in each village. To meet the transportation and training
needs of the Extension Service in the project area, vehicles and educational
materials will be provided under the project. The consultants required by the
Extension Service to assist in its training programs, program implementation
at the village level and for the development of audio-visual aids for the
drainage program are being supplied through two USAID programs recently
consummated between the Extension Service and USAID.
Production Restraints
17.       Restraints to agricultural production fall into two categories,
physical and physiological. The most significant where this project is con-
cerned is providing the proper physical environment for root growth. This
is directly related to drainage and salinity. Adverse drainage and salinity
conditions inhibit plant development. Thus inputs such as fertilizers,
improved high yielding strains, increase in support services, improved insect
and disease control measures have not increased average yields appreciably
over the last decade (Table 10). The second category is largely physiological,
namely, losses from diseases and insects, poor water management, and inadequate
timely land preparation for crops. Improvements in the breeds, feeding and
general maintenance of small and large livestock would also enhance output and
productivity in the agricultural sector.
Water Table Depth and Crop Yields
18.       The water table depth in the Delta to achieve optimum crop produc-
tion for the various crops has not been precisely determined in the field.
However, experiments conducted with soil-filled tanks, although it is doubtful
that all other factors affecting yields have been eliminated, have provided
some guidelines. The data show that maximum crop yields were obtained in
typically heavy soils when the depth from ground level to water table was
stabilized as follows:
Cotton                   1.30 m
Wheat                    1.10 m
Maize                    1.15 m
Egyptian clover          1.00 m



ANNEX 4
Page 7
19.       Very limited data are available on the direct effect of a fluctuating,
shallow water table (as distinct from the effect of salinity) on crop yields,
or on the effect of varying water table depths during the growing season. It
may reasonably be assumed that early in the growing period and for short
periods after each irrigation, higher non-saline water tables will not harm-
fully affect the yields, unless the root zones are waterlogged continuously
for several days, in which case the affected roots of most dryland crops,
including cotton, will rot. The field drains to be installed in the project
area are designed to lower the water table depth to at least 1.0 m within
72 hours after irrigation which would provide an adequate water table level
for all crops grown.
Salinity and Crops
20.       In the project area the salinity of the groundwater, increases
from around 480 ppm in the south to about 7,680 ppm in the northern parts.
Should the soil profile become saturated after irrigation, and drainage
facilities are inadequate, the saline groundwater will rise by capillary
movement to a level that would harm root development. Crop salt tolerance
varies with the crop, varieties, stage of growth, temperature and other
factors. Among the four major crops grown in the project area, cotton is the
most tolerant to salinity followed by wheat. Rice and maize have medium salt
tolerance and would suffer more from the saline conditions than cotton or
wheat. The level of yield reduction in the project area in the field due to
increasing salinity is not know. However, data taken from arid areas for
plants during rapid growth and maturation show the following which gives an
indication of the reduction in yields due to increasing salinity.

Cotton
21.       Cotton is the major export crop, occupies about one third of the
land available for crops, and is the major foreign exchange earner; hence,
its importance to the agricultural sector and the country, as a whole. Al-
though cotton is relatively tolerant to salinity, because of its deep rooting



ANNEX 4
Page 8
nature, it does not develop properly in soils with poor drainage properties.
The main commercial varieties of cotton (Gossypium barbadense) being grown in
Egypt now, are listed in the table below with their properties. In the project
site, in 1976, Giza 36 (Menoufi) and Giza 68 were grown mainly in Dakahlia
Governorate with small areas of both varieties in Kafr El-Sheik Governorate.
Giza 70 was grown mainly in Behera Governorate with small areas being culti-
vated in Gharbia and Kafr El-Sheik Governorate. Giza 36, 68, and 70 are
extra long staple varieties (over 1-3/8"). Sharkia and Gharbia Governorates
produced most of Giza 67 while Dakahlia produced about half that of each of
the previously mentioned Governorates. Giza 69 is grown only in Sharkia
Governorate. Giza 67 and Giza 69 are long staple varieties (over 1-1/4").
Only a small amount of Giza 75 (Giza 67 x Giza 69) is grown in Asmoun District
of Menoufiya Governorate. This variety has the large boll size of Giza 67 and
the high gin turnout of Giza 69.

22.       Cotton production, local consumption and farmgate prices are firmly
controlled by Government. The varieties of cotton are changed each year and
the acreage of each variety to be planted (based on predicted market demands)
is decided upon in early January. Since farmers must plant a certain amount
(25-30 percent) of their land to cotton, cotton controls the cropping pattern.
Approximately 40-50% of the crop is consumed locally. In 1976, about 1.25



ANNEX 4
Page 9
million feddans were planted and in March 1977, a total of 1.5 million feddans
are expected to be planted to cotton.   This will amount to approximately 25%
of the total cultivated area of Egypt. Cotton is not a popular crop with
farmers largely because of the price received and the high labor requirement
of the crop. This is especially true since cost for seasonal labor (har-
vesting) has risen about 40% over the past two years. Since farmers must
plant cotton, many have been planting it late preferring to get more returns
from a winter vegetable crop than the subsequent cotton crop. The high
returns from the vegetable crop off-sets the loss in yields by planting cotton
late.
Rice
23.       The project area includes the Governorates which are the largest
rice producers in the country. Behera, Dakahlia, Kafr El Sheik are first,
second and third respectively, with Behera producing about 1/3 of the total
rice crop in 1975. Sharkia is fifth in total rice grown while Damieta, not in
the project, is fourth. At the present time Giza 170 and Nahda are the major
varieties grown. Nahda in the past has been the standard variety and Giza
170 is a recent introduction. In 1977 the government expects to replace
these varieties in all rice growing areas with Giza 171 and Giza 172. These
varieties are now being propagated by the Ministry of Agriculture. The latter
two mentioned varieties are higher yielders than Giza 170 and Nahda. More-
over, the new varieties are blast-resistant and the milling out-turn is 74%
for Giza 171 and 172 vs. 70% for the others.
24.       Certified seed is distributed to rice growers at least every two
years (with about a 20% price subsidy) through the Agricultural Credit and
Cooperative Bank. Because of a well-organized seed production program, newly
released varieties produced by the Rice Research Section are quickly delivered
to rice growers and purity of seed is maintained. Rice yields in Egypt are
among the world's highest mainly because of productive land, high sunlight
intensity, moderate temperatures, industrious farmers and adequate water. In
1974, the average yield of paddy was 5.07 m t/ha and in 1975 it was 5.38 m
t/ha. In spite of these high yields, they can be higher with the control of
salinity, followed by improved cultural practices such as adequate fertilizer,
weed control and the proper planting time.
Wheat
25.       Wheat is the major food crop that must be imported (about 60% of
Egypt's needs), thus its importance in the economy and rotation. The major
wheat varieties grown are Giza 155 and Giza 156. These varieties are soft,
white and considered "spring" wheats, although they are sown in the fall in
Egypt. They are all Egyptian bred, rust-resistant and high-yielding. Under
conditions maintained at the research and breeding station, yields can reach
2 m tons per feddan. Some Mexican varieties such as Chenab 70 can exceed
Giza 155 by 10% and are grown to a limited extent in the Delta. The Mexican



ANNEX 4
Page 10
varieties, however, have not been particularly attractive to the farmers be-
cause of their tendency to shatter in the field, their high nitrogen require-
ments, over 60 Kg N/feddan, and their lack of resistance to rust diseases
under local conditions and poor straw quality.
26.       Giza 155 is the first Egyptian variety developed that had field
resistance to stem, stripe and leaf rusts and also give a 15-20 percent in-
crease in yield over the previously used varieties such as Giza 144 and Giza
150. Giza 155 was responsible for raising the national wheat yield in 1971
and 1972 to above the 3 m tons/ha level for the first time. Since the mid
1960s there has been a breeding program operating to develop an Egyptian
bred variety of the Mexican dwarf types that is rust resistant, non-lodging
and retains its high-yielding ability when given high nitrogen levels.
Maize
27.       Maize is the most widely grown grain in the Delta and is the main
cereal for bread-making among the rural population, and feeding animals in
the summer. Prior to the availability of water from the Aswan High Dam,
maize was planted in the Nili period (fall). Since 1965, most of the crop is
planted in the summer when the climate is more favorable and it is also less
effected by maize borers resulting in higher yields. The national average in
1964 was 8.32 ardebs/Feddan (2.78 m tons/ha) compared with an average of 10.54
ardebs/Feddan (3.51 m tons/ha) in 1965.
28.       Hybrids DC 175, DC 159, DC 19 and DC 186 are currently the commer-
cial varieties now grown in the Delta. DC 175 and DC 159 are susceptible to
late wilt while DC 19 and DC 186 have some resistance. Seed multiplication
is the major limiting factor to the expansion of acreage in hybrids. The
hybrids out-yield the long established variety American Early by 25% or more
on an experimental basis but only about 10% in the farmers' fields. There
are several other local varieties grown in the Delta and their yields are
about 15% below that of American Early. These varieties are early maturing
and, not being responsive to fertilizers, do not require high levels of
fertilizers.

APPRAISAL OF
NILE DELTA DRAINAGE II PROJECT
ARAB RPEUBLIC OF EGYPT
Agricultural Credit, Cooperatives, Marketing, and Prices
Agricultural Credit
1.        Egypt has a public credit system for agriculture comprising, the
Egyptian General Organization for Agriculture and Cooperative Credit (EGOACC)
responsible to the Ministry of Agriculture and 17 Agricultural Credit and
Cooperative Banks (ACCB) subordinated to it. Although legally independent,
EGOACC and the ACCBs work as one unit. The former functions as head office
and the latter as branch offices. The EGOACC undertakes the central planning
of agricultural and cooperative credit within the framework of the Ministry
of Agriculture's cropping policy and executes it through the ACCBs and their
sub-branches. Financial resources for the system are raised mainly from
the commercial banking sector at interest rates on average two percentage
points higher than those received from onlending to farmers. The resulting
deficit is covered by a subsidy in the Government budget.
2.        The system is organizationally weak, has a centralized bureau-
cratic structure, and due to lack of capital and lending skills, has mainly
restricted activities to short-term lending. District branches of the ACCBs
deal with the affiliated village-level rural cooperative societies, providing
credit, in cash or in kind, to finance each farmer's basic inputs for his
allocated crops, in amounts determined centrally. The system's banking
operations are inseparable from its non-banking operations which include
procurement, storage, sale of agricultural inputs, and crop marketing. ACCBs'
branches at district level manage about 1,050 grain and input supply stores,
and arrange for transportation and distribution of agricultural inputs.
Despite the high centralization of agricultural credit, and the integration of
credit banks and village cooperative societies and of credit and marketing
operations, the performance of the ACCBs is low and the loan recovery rates
are only of the order of 70%.
3.        Total lending activity of the ACCBs has risen from LE 36.6 million
in 1959/60 to LE 81.4 million in 1974/75, an average rate of increase of 5.4%
per annum (Table 1). Increases in lending slowed significantly from the
middle 1960s onward and total loans have yet to regain the level reached in
the 1966/67 period. This implies that lending in real terms has actually
been falling in recent years, although fixed prices for fertilizer over a
long period have ensured that application rates have not fallen off. Short-
term loans for seasonal crop expenses have made up more than 98% of total
lending in the past five years, with cotton accounting for between 40% and
50% of the short-term volume (Table 1).



ANNEX 8
Page 2
4.        A project to reorganize and recapitalize the agricultural credit
system is presently under preparation. With the assistance of USAID it is
envisaged to substantially increase the number of credit outlets through
opening about 700 village banks, each serving 5 to 6 villages. Additional
funds would enable the system to finance higher levels of application of
key inputs, especially fertilizer. The envisaged improvements in the field
of agricultural credit would also benefit the project area. No provision
for additional credit has therefore been made in this project. Even if the
envisaged measures should not materialize the project would not suffer unduly,
as the project's benefits have been computed at present levels of inputs.
5.        In addition to the credit facilities provided by the ACCB/EGOACC-
system, some of the commercial banks make loans to the agricultural sector,
but mainly for storage, marketing and processing operations. A recently
approved Bank loan to Egypt for the development of the horticultural sub-
sector provides for a line of credit of US$17 million to Bank Misr for on-
lending to private cooperative and public sector agroindustrial enterprises.
The objective of this credit operation is to assist in the development of
processing, packaging and handling facilities for horticultural products.
Direct lending to farmers is done by commercial banks only on a very limited
scale. The traditional non-institutional system of credit sources such as
moneylenders, traders, commission agents, friends and relatives is well
developed; but these sources lend fund mainly for other than directly
productive purposes.
Cooperatives
6.        As indicated above, Egypt has a centrally organized multipurpose
cooperative system which performs all vital commercial functions for the
farming community. Through compulsory membership and a quota system for each
major crop tied to predetermined input supplies, the cooperative system
directs the production decisions of thousands of small, independent farmers
into a cropping pattern consistent with the Government's production targets
for food and export crops.
7.        Each cooperative is managed by an agricultural engineer paid by the
Ministry of Agriculture to carry out both managerial and extension activities.
A chief accountant employed by the EGOACC oversees the commercial operations.
Other staff generally include a storekeeper and several clerks. The overall
management of each society is vested in an elected Board. In accordance
with the Cooperative Law the majority of Board members are drawn from among
farmers with less than 10 feddans. Most of them can barely read and write.
It is unlikely that they can effectively supervise and control the work of
the university-educated manager or give meaningful direction to the officers
of the society. Ineffective policy guidance coupled with generally low
management skills have left most local level cooperatives financially ex-
tremely weak, despite the financial support provided by the Government
which covers operational losses.
Marketing Arrangements
8.        Egypt has a mixed marketing system composed of official and private
enterprises. Agricultural products can be classified into three groups in



ANNEX 8
Page 3
terms of the way in which they are marketed. Cotton and sugarcane are ex-
clusively marketed through public sector channels. Wheat, rice, lentils and
groundnuts are partly marketed by the public sector and partly by the private
sector. The third group of products consists of animal products, maize,
fruit and vegetables which are freely marketed through private sector channels.
9.        Government policy of intervention in the marketing of agricultural
products is essentially based on two considerations. One is concerned with
the maximization of export earnings while the other is related to consumer
policy which aims at assuring food supply at relatively low prices. The chief
means used by the Government to accomplish these objectives are low prices to
farmers for products of the first and second category and their compulsory
delivery to official marketing outlets. Prices of the third category are
allowed to respond to local market demand and supply conditions.
10.       This discriminatory price policy has affected complex interactions
which were facilitated by Egypt's eminent suitability for both factor and
product substitution. Factor use is distorted with considerable consequences
for the government's policy objectives as farmers divert resources from
price regulated crops to those which are freely marketed without government
price intervention. Farmers, for example, use fertilizer allocated to cotton
for vegetables or they delay cotton planting to allow two or three cuttings
of catch crop clover instead of one cutting that was standard until recently,
thereby reducing cotton yields, etc. Egypt's farmers have shown great
flexibility in responding to the differences in the profitability of the
public and private sector markets.
Prices
11.       The sector's mixed marketing system is reflected in its producer
prices which have developed differently for controlled and uncontrolled
commodities (Tables 3 and 4). Prices of crops not subject to controls have
generally risen much faster than those controlled. Domestic producer prices
have usually been below world market parity. Farmers receive in the order of
70%-80% of the sales revenue from their cotton crops and 50% from rice sales,
the balance going to the Government. Annual changes in farmgate prices over
the last decade (1965-75) have varied between 3.4% for cotton and 11.2% for
berseem (Table 5). On an output-value-per-feddan basis annual changes were
1.9% for cotton and 8.5% for berseem (Table 6). Despite price rises, profit-
ability of cotton has continually declined. In the case of wheat and rice
increases in producer prices have had acreage responses while cotton plantings
continued to decline both in actual feddans and relative to its main com-
petitors despite the price rises and continuance of input subsidies.
12.       For cotton and rice the price differential between producers' re-
ceipts and actual receipts represent an implicit tax of from 15%-60% with a
resource transfer to the Government. For wheat and maize there has been a
recent transfer from producers to consumers (Table 4). Prior to this there
was a long period of transfers from the Government to producers rather than
from consumers who purchased from government procurement agencies at subsidized



ANNEX 8
Page 4
prices. Due to the Government's agricultural price policy, incomes have
moved in favor of those who can shift away from wheat, maize, and cotton
into rice, fruit, vegetables, berseem and wheat. This pattern particularly
favors farmers near cities in the Delta areas.

Farm Models
1.        The land tenure situation in the project area is unclear.  The
available data are contradictory and outmoded. They do not provide a realistic
basis from which to draw representative farm models. The limited investigation
carried out by the mission in the field provided evidence that tenant operated
farms of about I feddan are quite common in the Nile Delta. This farm size
was therefore chosen for the first farm model. Farm sizes of between 1.5 and
2 feddans were also found in substantial number. As a second farm model a
size of 1.7 feddans, tenant-operated, was taken. Among the larger farm sizes
only few were found with 5 feddans and more. For the category owner-operated,
a farm size of 3 feddans was chosen for a third model.
2.        The main distinction in the cropping pattern of farming in the
project area is the inclusion or exclusion of rice. In some areas the Ministry
of Irrigation has imposed certain water control measures which prohibit the
growing of rice. Farm models have been prepared to depict the budget estimates
for rice growing farms and those which do not grow rice.
3.        The basic input/output coefficients used in the farm models are set
out in Table 1. Assumptions with respect to areas under various crops are
given in Table 2. For both rice growing and non-rice growing farms an over-
all cropping intensity of 190% was assumed. Further assumptions underlying
budget estimates are as follows:
(a)  Prices of outputs and inputs are outlined in Annex 11,
Table 2. They are based on average farmgate prices
currently experienced in the area, or on officially
announced prices for certain crops.
(b) It is expected that with the project, requirements for
farm labor will somewhat increase. Serious shortages
are, however, not foreseen. In the cost estimates, all
labor has been valued at the present average wage rate
of LE 0.65 per day. The value of labor has been added
back into the net return figures, on the assumption that
most of it is, in fact, unpaid family labor.
(c) All crop output has been valued at the above indicated
farmgate prices (Annex 11, Table 2).  A certain portion



ANNEX 9
Page 2
of the output would, however, not be marketed but would be
consumed directly by the farm family. In the calculation
of net cash returns, it has been assumed that the following
amounts would be retained, and their value equivalent to
LE 47 has been deducted from the total:
Per Family
Item                          kg      Value (LE)
Wheat                               120           6
Maize                               400          20
Rice                                200           8
Beans                                60           5
Fruits and vegetables                -            8
47
(d) The present land tax is assumed to be LE 4 per feddan. On
tenant operated farms, rent is taken to be a multiple of
seven of the land tax which amounts to LE 28 per feddan.
Since 1973 all farms of less than 3 feddans are exempted
from paying any land tax. The tenancy law allows an owner
to pass on any increased land tax as a rent increase. For
this purpose it has been assumed that with the project the
land tax would increase by about 20%. Other taxes which
are at present 100% of the land tax cannot be passed on
to farmers. Allegedly it is common practice that rents
are fixed at higher rates than seven times the land tax,
which is quite conceivable, as land tax was last assessed
in 1952 based on 1949 values. As no clear evidence of
this could have been established, the upper legal limit
has been used in computing net returns. Costs for field
drainage have been calculated at about LE 100 per feddan
which would be recovered by annual instalments over a 20
year period without interest.

Cost Recovery for Field Drainage Works
Legal Background
1.        Law 74 of 1971 provides the legal basis for the recovery of the
costs incurred in the installation of field drainage systems. The construc-
tion of pumping stations and the remodelling of open main drains is considered
part of the public infrastructure and farmers are not expected directly to
contribute to their financing. The above mentioned law does not explicitly
mention any direct financial contribution by the farmers towards the mainte-
nance of the drainage systems. The law does however provide for the reassess-
ment of lands which have been improved through irrigation or drainage facilities
within one year of completion of the works. The law states that incremental
taxes levied on imported lands are considered as compensation for the costs
incurred by the Ministry of Irrigation for the maintenance of the drainage
systems. In addition farmers contribute indirectly towards investment and
maintenance costs through the difference between economic and financial
product prices which is substantial in the case of Egypt.
Recovery of Investment Costs for Field Drainage Works
2.        The recovery process of investment costs for field drainage systems
is divided into three clearly discernible steps involving three agencies,
namely, EPADP, the Survey Department of the Ministry of Irrigation, and the
Directorate General for Land Tax of the Ministry of Finance. After completing
the works in a field drainage unit EPADP prepares a cost statement showing the
actual construction costs, including a 10% administrative charge. Together
with a map, showing the location of the field drainage unit, EPADP forwards
the cost statement to the Survey Department of the Ministry of Irrigation
which as a second step verifies the area and ascertains equal treatment of
all beneficiaries of field drainage works in the country. The verified maps
and data are then forwarded to the Directorate General for Land Tax of the
Ministry of Finance. There the information is transferred into their own
records and maps. After delineating the area of each individual beneficiary
the Directorate General prepares a cost bill for each beneficiary of the
field drainage unit. A list of these individual bills is then advertised for
at least one week at the local cooperative society or the local policy sta-
tion to give the persons concerned the opportunity to oppose their assessment
within 30 days. After the expiration date, actual collection can commence.
Payments can either be made in lump sum or in up to 20 annual instalments.
According to the Directorate General so far all beneficiaries of field
drainage works have opted for the instalment plan. The law stipulates that
payments for field drainage works are to commence not later than 12 months
after completion of the works.



ANNEX 10

Recovery of Maintenance Costs for Field Drainage Systems
3.        As mentioned above, Law 74 of 1971 does not contain any provision for
direct charges to be paid for the maintenance of field drainage systems. In
the past these costs were considered to be recovered as part of the reassessed
land tax following the completion of field drainage systems. For the majority
of the farming community in the project area this basis for paying the mainte-
nance costs was removed in 1973 when a Presidential Decree exempted all hold-
ings of less than 3 feddans from paying land tax. During negotiations it was
therefore agreed that a Ministerial Decree will be issued before the project
will be presented to the Board of Executive Directors. The Decree stipulate
that the costs of field drainage maintenance will be recovered on a continuing
basis. This Decree will also apply to the three previous drainage projects.
In practice these costs will be collected together with the instalment for
the field drainage investment cost. The maintenance costs will be reviewed
annually to cover the actual costs of the maintenance units, each of which
will cover 10,000 feddans.
Past Experience with Payments for Field Drainage Works
4.        The following analysis of the experience with cost recovery for
field drainage works is based on data for 75 contracts executed between 1970
and 1975 covering an area of 320,000 feddans in Upper and Lower Egypt, both
inside and outside IDA/Bank financed projects. As of December 31, 1976 cost
recovery payments were collected for 79,400 feddans or 25% of the eligible
area of 320,000 feddans. Based on this information BE 125,000 or 26% of the
potential amount of SE 481,000 was collected during 1976.
5.        On average it took EPADP 13 months to prepare the map showing the
area in which the drainage works had been executed and to finalize the state-
ment showing the actual costs incurred including the 10% administrative charge.
The actual time required for the preparation of these documents varied from
9 to 44 months for individual drainage units.
6.        The Survey Department of the Ministry of Irrigation required on
average 24 months to verify the area and to assure equal treatment of all
field drainage beneficiaries in the country, with actual times spent for
this function ranging from 4 to 76 months for the 75 analyzed contracts.
7.        The Ministry of Finance through its Directorate General for Land Tax
executes the actual collection of cost payments for field drainage systems in
connection with the collection of land tax. To issue bills to each individual
holding within the drainage unit and to make them effective through public
advertisement took an average of 16 months. For individual drainage units it
took the Directorate General between 4 and 37 months to start collection of
payments. As recommended by a recent supervision mission, two survey engineers
were recently seconded to the Directorate General to assist it in the prepara-
tion of the maps necessary to locate individual holdings.



ANNEX 10
Page 3
8.        The law stipulates that payments for field drainage installations
commence not later than 12 months after the completion of the works. Based
on the above analysis, the aggregate of the average times spent by the three
agencies involved was 53 months or almost 4-1/2 years per drainage unit. The
survey Department of the Ministry of Irrigation with an average of 24 months
per drainage unit was the slowest of the three agencies. It is important
to mention that the above calculations give only an approximation of the
actual time required in the preparatory process for cost recovery, as the
administrative work for 47 of the analyzed 75 contracts has not been com-
pleted. This means that the time actually spent could be well in excess of
the above-mentioned figures. During negotiations, it was agreed that the
Government will do its best to either meet the provisions of the law or to
modify the law to bring it in line with actual practice.
9.        Collection of maintenance costs for field drainage will commence
during the second year after completion of the works as the contractor is
responsible for their maintenance during the first year. This provision
has been made to guarantee effective working conditions of the drainage
system.

Economic Rate of Return
1.        Economic rates of return were calculated on the basis of data dis-
played in Table 1. The following assumptions were made for computing the
rates of return:
(a) Crop Prices. For the four major crops included in the project,
i.e. cotton, rice, wheat, and maize, IBRD price projections for
international markets, adjusted to farmgate levels, were used.
(b) Prices for Investment Items and Farm Inputs. Investment items
to be financed under the project were valued at unit prices of
similar works and previously awarded contracts, adjusted to
end-1976 levels. Fertilizers and chemicals were adjusted for
subsidies. Other inputs were valued at 1976 prices.
(c) Labor. All farm labor has been valued at the average current
wage rate of LE 0.65 per day. This is justified because of
the high labor demand in the project area where cropping in-
tensity is 190%.
(d) Exchange Rate. Foreign exchange has been converted at the
parallel market rate of LE 1 = US$1.5.
(e) Replacement of Equipment. Drainage pumps would be replaced
in year 22 (Annex 6), and residual value of equipment totaling
US$4.02 million is credited to the project in years 5 and 6.
(f) Crop Yields. Due to the project, crop yields would rise
over present levels by 20% for cotton, 12% for rice, 25% for
maize, and 18% for wheat. Without the project crop yields
would decline linearly 30% over 35 years. No incremental
benefits for fruits, vegetables, berseem and other crops
have been included in the calculation.
(g) On-Farm Costs. On-farm costs for cultivation, seeds,
fertilizers and chemicals would remain at the same level
with and without the project. Costs for inputs which are
directly related to outputs, such as harvest labor and
transportation charges, have been adjusted for higher
yields.



ANNEX 11
Page 2
2.        Based on these asumptions the economic rate of return was estimated
at 23%. To test the project against value and time changes in costs and
benefits, sensitivity analyses were carried out and the results are summarized
below:
Sensitivity Analysis
Rate of Return
Basic calculation                                                  23.0
Cost up 15%                                                        20.6
Cost up 25%                                                        19.3
Benefits down 15%                                                  20.3
Benefits down 25%                                                  18.3
Cost up 25% and benefits down 25%                                  15.3
These calculations indicate that even under highly adverse conditions the
rate of return would not drop below 15.3% and the proposed investments would
stil result in substantial gains to the economy.
3.        The Bilharzia control component has not been included in the rate of
return calculations because of the difficulties in quantifying the benefits.
In the areas, however, which have already been treated successfully against
the disease, it has been shown that the effects of bilharzia control go beyond
the obvious preventive effects which could possibly be expressed statistically.
Bilharzia control means an improvement in the quality of life which can only
be fully appreciated by those who suffer from the disease or by those whose
livelihood depends on a person whose productivity is seriously affected
by it.
4.        The project would also provide a number of non-quantifiable economic
benefits which, although not reflected in the rate of return, greatly support
the justification for the project. The most prominent is, that during the
five-year implementation period the project would create demand for labor
totaling 58,000 man-years. From year 6 onwards the annual labor demand for
operation and maintenance would be 2,310 man-years. At full development on-
farm labor requirements would have increased by 8% or 1.5 million man-days
annually. For Egypt's rapidly increasing population this labor creating
element of the project would be extremely valuable.

APPRAISAL OF
NILE DELTA DRAINAGE II PROJECT
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Bilharzia Control
General
1.        Bilharziasis, or schistosomiasis, is recognized as the most impor-
tant public health problem in Egypt and there is considerble evidence of its
ancient origins. MIany of the relationships between the respective infections
and the more serious clinical manifestations such as urinary tract diseases,
bladder cancer or involvement of the portal circulatory system and liver
failure have now been established. It is estimated that there are now more
than 300 million infected individuals in tropical and subtropical areas
throughout the world. Of the three most important schistosomes infecting man,
Schistosoma haematobium, S. mansoni and S. japonicum, both S. haematobium and
S. mansoni are endemic in Egypt (being transmitted by the snail species
Bulinus truncatus and Biomphalaria alexandrina respectively). S. haematobium
is prevalent in the Nile Valley from Aswan to Cairo and throughout the Delta
and S. mansoni is confined to the Delta with a low prevalence in the Gov-
ernorate of Giza near Cairo. S. laponicum is not endemic in Egypt.
Life Cycle
2.        The adult schistosome worms live in the blood vessels.  Those of
S. haematobium inhabit the veins around the bladder and produce the urinary
form of the disease, while adult worms of S. mansoni are mainly found in
the posterior veins of the bowel and are responsible for an intestinal and
hepatic (liver) form of the disease. The three species of schistosomes
commonly affecting man have similar life cycles and develop in stages. Eggs
which are laid by the adult female worms in terminal blood vessels surrounding
either the bladder or intestine eventually reach the lumens of these organs,
and are then voided in the urine or faeces. When the eggs reach fresh water
a small free swimming larva, the miracidium, hatches and is infective to a
snail intermediate host. In the appropriate snail host, development stages
called sporocysts are produced which in some 4-7 weeks later in turn produce
another free swimming larva, the cercaria, which is infective to the definitive
host, man. The usual portal of entry is the skin and man becomes infected
through contact with waters infested with these larvae, which may live up to
48 hours after being shed by the snail. After penetration of the skin, the
larvae migrate and eventually develop into the mature adult worms which com-
mence egg-laying in the respective locations already described. This may
begin in some 6-12 weeks after penetratin of the skin. Only a small propor-
tion of the eggs laid by the adult worms are voided in the excreta of man and
serious pathological lesions and sequelae of infection result from the numerous
eggs which are retained in the tissues and organs of an infected person.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
Symptoms
3.        Egg excretion in the case of S. haemotobium usually occurs 10-12
weeks after initial infection and may be associated with pain, frequency of
passing urine and haematuria (the presence of blood in the urine). The
majority of infected children in endemic areas are in this stage of the dis-
ease. Haematuria is not always considered by infected people as abnormal.
Some people consider it to be a normal process of puberty and not requiring
medical treatment while others may ignore pain but may seek treatment with
the onset of haematuria.  The established S. haematobium infection may produce
changes in the bladder, lesions in the ureters and kidneys and other dis-
orders of the urinary tract. Involvement of other organs and systems such
as the genital tract, lungs and ceintral nervous system may also take place.
The onset of symptoms of S. mansorni infection may occur in 3-8 weeks after
exposure.
Prevalence
4.        The prevalence of bilharzia infection is generally higher in males
than in females, rises to a maximum at the age of 10-15 years, and begins
to fall gradually after the age oE 20 years. Prevalence of S. haematobium,
according to the returns of endemic diseases hospitals decline from north to
south in Upper Egypt - Beni Suef 40.9%, El Minya 43.4%, Asyut 36.5%, Sohag
40.1%, Qena 31.7% and Aswan 27.2%. Although these data represent biased
samples of the populations in the different areas, they serve to indicate the
order of prevalence. They undoubtedly, however, underestimate the prevalence
of S. haematobium in many rural areas within the districts of respective Gov-
ernorates and, the heterogenous distribution of the infections (see Table I).
5.        Data from Rural Health Units show that a reduction in overall preva-
lence of infection of 3.4% occurred between 1964 and 1971 in Asyut while in
Qena a rise of 8.6% is noted. Compared with data collected in 1935, the
prevalence of S. haematobium apparently increased markedly in Asyut, Sohag,
Qena and Aswan during the following decade and afterwards which is directly
attributable to the conversion from basin to perrennial irrigation. Intensive
chemotherapy practised during the past 15 years may have accounted for the
observed general downward trend in prevalence of S. haematobium in Egypt.
6.        It is estimated that there is an overall S. haematobium prevalence
of about 25% in the population of approximately 5,000,000 in the proposed
project area between Aswan and Asyut.
Infection with S. haematobium and S. mansoni
7.        The association of bilharzia with bladder cancer in Egypt is statis-
tically highly significant, and this most serious consequence of the infection
is seen in many young people in Middle and Upper Eypt. The age-specific pre-
valence of S. haematobium infection, its rise and fall is the same as for
cancer of the bladder, but occurs ten years earlier.



ANNEX 12
Page 3
8.        In regions such as the Nile Delta mixed infections with S. haematobium
and S. mansoni are extremely common and it is difficult to determine the patho-
logy due to each parasite. The long term adverse effects of these chronic
infections are frequently underestimated and a general deterioration in health
may be complicated by other infections and malnutrition. The mortality rate
due to bilharzia in Egypt has been estimated to vary form 0.1 to 1% according
to the local prevalence and intensity of infection.
9.        Health education in Egypt in recent years in schools and at health
centers has resulted in many more persons seeking treatment at hospitals
and health units. Such treatment, if the course is completed, should confer
considerable benefit on the individual concerned. Often, however, in the
absence of alternative water supplies or through occupational necessity,
or sheer ignorance, individuals who have been treated become reinfected.
Undoubtedly, throughout the Nile Valley there are many districts and vil-
lages, and even parts of villages, in which prevalence and intensity of infec-
tion are far above the levels recorded by the returns from rural health units
and endemic diseases hospitals. There is a clear need for integrated control
combining systematic treatment of infected persons with adequate measures
against the snail intermediate host in order to prevent reinfection and ef-
fectively reduce transmission.
10.       Control may have the objective of limiting the spread of infection,
reducing morbidity or controlling and even stopping transmission. Control of
transmission implies reduction of bilharzia to a prevalence where it is no
longer a major public health problem. Control once achieved must be main-
tained by applying a continuing program, although a reduction in the degree
of applied measures should be possible during later consolidation phases.
The different methods of control include selective on mass therapy of the
human definitive host, environmental sanitation, control of contact with
water and control of the molluscan intermediate host. These methods will
prove more or less effective according to the conditions where they are ap-
plied and each has advantages and disadvantages.
11.       It is now generally recognized that treatment of the infected
population while not always curing the individuals, causes a marked reduc-
tion in the number of eggs passed. Mass or selective chemotherapy, as a
control procedure, has as its main objective a reduction in the number of
bilharzia eggs passed by a community. A secondary benefit would be the
alleviation of symptoms and reduced morbidity in individuals resulting from
fewer bilharzia eggs being deposited in their tissues.
12.       It is considered that snail control is a cost-effective means of
controlling transmission where the volume of water to be treated per caput
of protected population is small, such as in an irrigation system with a
high population density. A combination of control methods directed against
different links in the life-cycle is most likely to achieve a threshold level
below which transmission will cease and the composition of any control pro-
gram must depend on local conditions.



ANNEX 12

Control Programs in Egypt
13.       A control program was initiated in El Fayoum in 1969 using mollus-
cicide applications for snail control in the spring, summer and autumn, and
chemotherapeutic treatment of the infected population. Prevalence of S.
haematobium was reduced from 45.7% to 9.1% between 1968 and 1974, and trans-
mission of bilharziasis was effectively stopped.
14.       The integrated bilharzia control program  initiated in 900,000 fed-
dans of Middle Egypt north of Dairut under Upper Egypt Drainage I Project, in
1976, supports the Fayoum control project. This has been supplemented
by control work in a further 120,000 feddans between Asyut and Dairut under
Upper Egypt Drainage II Project.
15.       Preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of the Bayluscide appli-
cations show that prior to the use of the molluscicide, 20 snails per 100 dips
were found in the primary, secondary and tertiary canals with higher densities
in the field drains. Following mollusciciding, no snails were detected in the
canals over a 7-week period. Snails were then found in primary and secondary
branch canals at a density of 3 per 100 dips. No snails had been detected in
any tertiary canals or in any of the treated drains 14 weeks later. The
large-scale chemotherapy orientation trial which was conducted on some 90,000
infected people of all age groups in the project area of Upper Egypt showed
the compound to have high acceptance by the people with minimal side-effects.
Follow-up examinations have shown that treatment with metrifonate has resulted
in high cure rates greater than 80% and substantial egg load reductions larger
than 90%. The latter is important since it reduces the transmission of S.
haematobium and brings about also a drop in the morbidity caused by the in-
fection.
16.       The proposed control program will cover the entire irrigated area
of 1,200,000 feddans between Asyut and Aswan (Map IBRD 12717) which has a
total population of about 5 million people, thus complementing and reinforcing
the extensive control measures now in progress north of Asyut and completing
control of S. haematobium from Aswan to the area of Giza near Cairo. The
project will be of 3 years duration, commencing with the purchase of equipment
and materials and the establishment of the necessary organization to execute
the program. At least one year will be necessary to carry out epidemiological
evaluation and to collect sound baseline data and also ensure that all procure-
ments under this loan are completed before the commencement of full operations
in 1978.
17.       In the respective Governorates of the project area there are 137 rural
health centers and 344 health units with suitably qualified staff to provide
treatment of the infected people. In the same Governorates 28 district snail
control inspectorates, 59 snail control centers and 236 snail control units have
already been established, with suitably qualified staff, to carry out the snail
control program under the proposed project. Under the circumstances prevail-
ing in the project area, these two integrated measures involving snail control



ANNEX 12
Page 5
by the application of molluscicide and treatment of the infected population
would achieve the best control of bilharzia at this time. It is considered
that these measures will be most cost-effective if the entire area is con-
sidered for delivery of control measures, thus reducing the cost of protection
per caput of population.
Proposed Snail Control Measures
18.       It has been demonstrated that a good molluscicide, when properly
applied in the field, kills at least 99% of the snails and that snail popula-
tions will remain below 5-10% of their original level during some 8 weeks fol-
lowing such treatment. It is considered that mollusciciding of the entire
area should be initiated in March and completed by early May. This would
result in a low snail population during the ensuing summer period when
transmission would be highest. Optimum control of snails would be achieved
by another area-wide application of molluscicide 7-8 weeks later in mid-July.
A further application of the chemical should be made in mid-September on an
area-wide basis to cover control of transmission during the autumn period.
19.       In order to achieve and maintain an acceptable level of snail con-
trol, the following program would be initiated:
(a) Bayluscide (70% wettable powder) would be applied by dis-
pensing into all irrigation branch canals and lateral distri-
butaries at 1-2 mg/litre for 8 hours, 3 times during each
year, in spring, summer and early autumn - in relation to the
15-day irrigation water rotation system and any variations
being operated.
(b) The molluscicide would similarly be applied to main and field
drains wherever flow conditions render this method of applica-
tion feasible.
(c) The molluscicide would be applied by spraying (at 1 mg/litre
active material) at the tails of tertiary irrigation canals
and in main and field drains with vegetative cover.
(d) Chemical analysis would be carried out during applications to
ensure that adequate concentrations are maintained throughout
that part of the system being treated. Snail surveillance
would be carried out to ensure the efficacy of mollusciciding.
Environmental Effects
20.       Area-wide application of the molluscicide Bayluscide will initially
result in fish mortality. The fish thus freshly killed are fit for human
consumption without harmful side effects. The molluscicide is biodegradeable
and causes minimal and only temporary alterations in microflora and microfauna
in the habitat. It is harmless to higher plants including rice and cotton



ANNEX 12
Page 6
and produces no adverse effects in the fruits and foliage of citrus or banana
trees. The basic chemical molecule of Bayluscide, (niclosamide), is identical
to that of the pharmaceutical procluct Yomesan, which is used for treatment of
tapeworms in man.
Chemotherapy
21.       The delivery of chemotherapy in the project area will be carefully
planned in relation to available rural health units with proper facilities
and adequate staff. It is estimated that some 1,250,000 infected persons will
require treatment during the program, using the organophosphorus compound
metrifonate (Bilarcil)R, which is currently being used in the control schemes
of Upper Egypt Drainage I and II Projects.
Continuity of Control Measures
22.       It is essential that adequate provision be made for continuity and
maintenance of bilharzia control measures in the project area beyond the
operational 3 year period. The control strategy should be reviewed and, if
necessary, redesigned in the light of the endemic situation prevailing when
the integrated measures of area-wide snail control and chemotherapy have been
applied and properly evaluated (4-5 years). The shape of the ongoing main-
tenance control program may well be different to the proposed project strategy
for initial implementation, and cost levels may well be considerably reduced.
In this context "control" means continuous activity and, although the inputs
may be reduced, recurrent expendLture will be required.
Bilharzia Control Equipment and Cost
23.       The equipment, vehicles and material necessary for the 3-year
operational program of bilharzia control are listed in Annex 7, Table 1.
The requirements have been estimated considering the infra-structure of the
existing snail control organization in the respective Governorates of the
project area, and in relation to the needs of the proposed control project.
24.       The molluscicide Bayluscide would be purchased in the 70% wettable
powder form and it is estimated that 200 metric tons per year will be needed.
It should be noted that this quantity has been calculated in relation to
synoptic data, for the irrigation system in the project area. This material
and the drug, metrifonate (Bilarcil)R are available from only one manufacturer.
