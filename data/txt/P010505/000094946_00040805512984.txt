A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex I)
The long-term goal of the project is to reduce poverty in the selected districts of Rajasthan which
are amongst the poorest in the state. The project's development objective is to improve the economic
opportunities, living standards and the social status of the poor in selected villages of these districts.
Specifically, the project would: (a) mobilize and empower the poor and help them to develop strong
grassroots organizations that facilitate access to and participation in democratic and development
processes; (b) support small-scale sub-projects that are priorities chosen, planned and implemented by the
poor; (c) expand the involvement of the poor in economic activities by improving their capacities, skills,
access to social and economic infrastructure and services, and employment opportunities; and (d) improve
the abilities of non-government, government and elected government (Panchayati Raj) institutions (PPIs) to
hear, reach and serve poor clients, i.e., to function in a more inclusive and participatory manner.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
A sample of key performance indicators that would be used to assess achievement of the project's
development objective is given below.
Indicators of Social Capital Development
3   Number of common interest groups formed among the poor, active, and sustained over time
(including range of activities, etc.); also, women's groups and tribal groups
i Improved social status of participant households and capacity to participate in collective action
beyond the project
v Inclusiveness of PRIs in decision-making
* Operation and management arrangements, including type, regularity and value of beneficiary
contributions
Indicators of Economic (including Infrastructural) Improvements
* Number of sub-project proposals submitted, funded and implemented
* Infrastructure created: type, number, economic value, quality, utilization
* Improvements in practical skills among participants (e.g., planning and decision-making,
productive, entrepreneurial, technical, financial management skills)
*   Increases in access to and utilization of social and economic services (including credit,
markets, health, and education)
*   Number of credit-worthy, bank-linked groups; volume of savings and formal sector credit; and
micro-enterprises started and successful
*   Increased income and assets among participant households, related to: (a) skill development;
(b) infrastructure improvements; (c) access to economic/social services
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: CAS: 17241-IN                   Date of latest CAS discussion: 01/15/98
Progress Report No. R99-12, IDA/R99-10                 Discussed on              02/18/99
The key objective of the Bank Group's assistance to India is to reduce poverty by accelerating
economic growth with equity. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) specifically proposes to assist India
to develop innovative, well-targeted programs to reduce poverty. This project would be one such initiative;
-2 -



two similar projects are being prepared in Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The areas in which
investments would be made under the project -- social organization and development, human capital
development, agriculture and allied activities, natural resource management, infrastructure -- are among the
priority sectors identified in the CAS. The Country Strategy includes a focus on states with a commitment
to economic reforms. The state of Andhra Pradesh embarked on reforms with Bank assistance; and
Rajasthan is already engaged in important reforms in the areas of public finance, power and irrigation,
while in dialogue with the Bank regarding possible assistance to its program. Finally, the CAS aims to
promote decentralization and beneficiary participation in development, which are key aspects of the
proposed project.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
As the Bank's 1997 India Poverty Assessment reported, the incidence of poverty in rural areas was
around 36.7 percent in 1993-94. Rajasthan's rural poverty ratio was 47.5 percent. This mass of poverty
encompasses people who live in resource-poor regions, those who lack productive assets (especially land),
skills or capacities due to ill-health, disability or illiteracy, and those who are inadequately organized to
utilize available resources or services. Resource-poor regions are also generally those where infrastructure
such as roads and markets is inadequately developed, which compounds the problems of inaccessibility and
low productivity. Since the early 1950s, the Government of India and state governments have implemented
programs to develop the resources of such regions (e.g., land development, agriculture, irrigation, forestry,
water supply programs), or directly address the poverty of disadvantaged households. The direct
anti-poverty programs (APPs) include efforts to provide wage-employment, productive assets (such as land
or animals), skills, credit, and food security. However, these efforts have not succeeded in reducing
poverty to the extent necessary. High levels of ill-health, low literacy among adults, and social problems
such as gender and caste discrimination prevail, and also constrain the reduction of poverty.
Government development programs are implemented through a sizable government presence in the
form of administrative and technical agencies at the district and sub-district levels. However, low
beneficiary involvement in planning, implementation and monitoring of these programs has resulted in
many being supply-driven, primarily by numerical targets. Recently, several state governments in the
counitry, including Rajasthan, have engaged in widespread social mobilization programs to improve the
acceptability, utilization and accountability of public programs, and some multilateral and bilateral aid
agencies such as UNICEF, UNDP and SIDA have financed small-scale efforts of this nature. Particularly
noteworthy in Rajasthan are the Women's Development Program, non-formal education efforts such as
Lok Jumbish and Shiksha Karmi, and the Right to Information campaigns, all of which have heightened
people's, especially women's, awareness and participation in development.
The Bank's analytical report on Rajasthan draws attention to the state's low per capita income,
lowest female literacy in the country (around 20 percent), worse than average health status, and extremely
low status of women (e.g., only 27 percent of girls aged 10 years complete primary school, compared with
57 percent for the country as a whole). Although the state's economy has grown faster than that of the
country as a whole over the past decade (at 6 percent compared with 5.3 percent), its public agencies are in
financial distress while there is under-spending on infrastructure and social services. Spending in these
areas is also not efficient: the quality of public infrastructure is poor, and there are imbalances in health
infrastructure, worker and supply ratios. There is a great need for water conservation and irrigation
measures, potable water, roads, schools, adult literacy, and basic health services. While the reform efforts
would aim to rectify some of these problems though macro-level fiscal adjustments and by improving the
state's revenue position, this project aims at micro-level improvements, including improving the efficiency
of spending by better targeting, greater synergy, attention to intra-household issues, and people's
participation in implementation as well as in operation and maintenance (O&M) to ensure the long-term
- 3 -



sustainability of investments. The development of appropriate approaches under the project, including
management improvements, could assist the state government to improve the efficiency of its public
expenditure more widely in the future.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The major sector issues that this project would address are:
*   the high incidence of poverty in resource poor areas;
*   the multi-factorial causation of poverty encompassing both social and economic
dimensions;
*   the inadequacy of infrastructure and public services in poor areas and/or their
inaccessibility to poor people;
*   weak, or a lack of, organization among the poor;
*   inadequate targeting and inefficient management of development programs meant for the
poor;
*   the lack of community participation in the design and implementation of programs;
*   poor local-level accountability in development programs; and
*   inadequate synergy between different types of efforts to reduce poverty, e.g., direct and
indirect anti-poverty measures, and efforts to address 'area poverty' and 'people poverty'.
The state government is concerned about the intractability of poverty and is seeking innovative
ways to address it. The proposed project aims to meet this need by developing a demand-driven approach
in which the poor themselves identify the actions and investments required, and take responsibility in their
implementation. Community ownership and contributions would be the cornerstones of the project. The
project would establish the social institutional base for planning and implementation of activities in a wide
range of sectors. Implementation would involve public and private entities, with the implementing agencies
responsible to communities, and user groups overseeing implementation. By applying strong participatory
principles, the proposed project would ensure that activities and resources are targeted to those who need
them and would utilize them efficiently. In sum, the project aims to improve the living standards of
disadvantaged households through increased flexibility, efficiency and local ownership of government
efforts and, for sustainability, to establish a system to allocate resources to the poor that can expand and
draw in other programs.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project would support key policy and institutional reforms which are under way in Rajasthan
(and other parts of India) in the areas of poverty reduction, decentralization, fiscal management and
administration. These include:
e   social mobilization and improved people's participation in implementation and management of
programs througlh engagement of local workers, group-based approaches;
*   increasing the voice of the poor, particularly in local-level resource allocation, and improved
targeting of programs to them, to women and other dis.,dvantaged groups;
e addressing people's right to information and increasing accountability of public institutions;
* lean and professional management structures and better deployment of staff;
* flexibility and local adaptation of training, delivery systems, procedures and norms;
* more equitable use of public assets (e.g., lands, water resources, public buildings);
*   involvement of local government bodies (PRIs) in management, and of mechanisms such as
gram sabhas for voicing and redressing grievances, decision making, etc.; balancing PRIs
with wider people's organizations;
*   involvement of NGOs in training, service delivery, social mobilization, rendering of technical
assistance and other support services, and government-NGO partnerships;
* consolidation/integration of public programs aimed at poverty reduction/improved synergies
between them; transfer of poverty-alleviation programs to the state sector;
*   collection of community contributions for capital as well as operation and maintenance (O&M)
costs.

By supporting the above approaches, the project would demonstrate their value and impact, and
provide a forum for continued dialogue with the state and central government on future reforms. The
project is highly relevant to direct efforts to reduce poverty and to departmental programs, e.g., in health,
education, drinking water and sanitation, watershed development, agriculture and animal husbandry. All
these departments aim to reduce poverty and account for a much larger share of public spending than the
anti-poverty programs. Many are striving to achieve some of the strategic and policy changes listed above.
Hence, the project would be instrumental in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of development
programs at large.
3. Benefits and target population:
Target Population
To reach the poor, the project would utilize three types of targeting.
Geographic targeting: The project has selected the seven poorest districts of Rajasthan (20
percent of districts) and, within these, it would focus on the poorest blocks, villages and habitations. All
districts in the state were ranked according to several economic and social criteria, and those with the
lowest aggregate ranks were selected. The criteria were: the percent of Scheduled Castes and Tribes in the
total population; the percent of agricultural laborers among total workers; the percent of the population
below the poverty line; the proportion of villages not having a primary school within 5 kilometers; the
proportion of villages not having a health facility within 5 kilometers; the proportion of workers in
manufacturing to total workers (an indicator of the industrial base of the district); the number of kilometers
of road per 100 square kilometer area; female literacy; total literacy; net sown area to total cropped area;
irrigated area to total cropped area; cropping intensity; per capita rural income. The project districts are:
Baran, Churu, Dausa, Dholpur, Jhalawar, Rajsamand and Tonk. The blocks in each district were also
ranked in a similar manner.
Group targeting. The project would mobilize groups of poor people and target capacity- building
and sub-project investments to them. Group members would be from socially and economically
disadvantaged households, particularly Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, women, female-headed
households, landless laborers and backward occupations.
Self-targeting. The project would focus on basic goods, small investments and activities, such as
labor-intensive construction, that primarily attract the poor.
Social assessments (SAs) were carried out in each district. In addition to identifying the poorest
communities and the poorest groups in 'mixed' communities, the SAs determined their priorities,
appropriate areas for intervention, and the most effective mechanisms to involve them in the project. A
strategy for area coverage also evolved during the SA process: the project would begin in identified poor
areas (village clusters) of the two poorest blocks in each district, and progressively cover additional clusters
and then other blocks in the district. The SAs also initiated a participatory planning process that would be
developed further during the project to ensure that communities access project funds and utilize them
effectively. Social assessments would continue during the project to identify pockets of poverty, poor
groups, and interventions in additional areas, and to provide feedback on project activities in areas already
covered.
Benefits
About 350,000 poor families would benefit directly from the project. Benefits would include:
empowerment through mobilization and organization, information and improved awareness of services,
rights, etc.; new or improved skills; increased earning opportunities and incomes; and greater access to
-6 -



productive assets, infrastructure, and economic and social services. The poor in the proposed project
districts would also benefit more broadly from improvements in the abilities of the district administrations
and panchayats to respond to demand from poor clients, and from the resultant improved effectiveness
(through better targeting and ownership) of on-going development programs, encompassing those that build
infrastructure and/or deliver services.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The institutional arrangements include the organizations of the poor, and the mechanisms to ensure
their access to funds for investments and technical support services, in addition to lean project management
units (PMUs). The PMUs would be community-oriented and decentralized, with operational autonomy.
Their most important attribute would be the ability to work with poor communities as well as with public
and private institutions that provide relevant resources and services.
Common Interest Groups (CIGs) Common interest groups would be the key organizations of the
project, formed among poor people living within a proximity that makes it feasible to come together to
plan, manage and implement small-scale projects of their choice. These groups would be organized and
assisted by Community Facilitators (CFs), who are local community residents hired by local
non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The CFs would work with the CIGs to prioritize their needs and
develop appropriate sub-projects, arrange for these to be appraised, technically assisted by government line
departments or private agencies and financed, and help to manage and implement them. The CIGs would
be fully responsible for implementation of the sub-projects, and for post-investment operation and
maintenance. Further details about CIGs are given in Annex 2, Attachment 1.
Village Development Associations (VDAs). At the habitation level, Village Development
Associations would be formed to consolidate the interests of CIGs and expand their ambit, transfer learning
and assistance (technical, financial, and managerial) across CIGs, and resolve any conflicts that may arise.
The VDAs would be responsible for ensuring that sub-project activities do not duplicate each other and are
harmonized with other village development activities, coordinating with the Gram Panchayat/Panchayat
Samiti where appropriate. They may propose, undertake and be responsible for post-investment operation
and maintenance of village-wide works. The VDAs would consist of all the members of the CIGs in a
habitation, and their Executive Committees would be comprised of a representative of each CIG,
member(s) of the ward/ gram panchayat or sarpanch if resident in the specific habitation, other
representatives of the village poor who are not yet organized into groups chosen at the gram sabha and the
Community Facilitator for the habitation. This, largely poor, membership would ensure that these
organizations are not captured by village elites, and that they carry out development activities to benefit the
poor. The chairperson of the VDA would be the sarpanch of the gram panchayat in which the habitation
is located (or hlis/her nominee). The Committee would elect its own chairperson (who may or may not be a
panchayat member). The CF would be the member secretary of the VDA and the Committee.
Panchayati Raj Instittions (PRIs). While maintaining operational independence, CIGs and
VDAs would be assisted to develop a productive relationship with the local PRI, normally the Gram
Panchayats of the habitation/village. The project would focus on developing the dialogue between Gram
Panchayats and CIGs on the problems and priority needs of the poor, and facilitate identification and
preparation of community proposals for project financing which are endorsed by both CIGs and PRIs in the
VDAs. Financing of such proposals would enable the project to build confidence and trust between the
ClGs and PRIs. Project efforts would include preparation of micro-plans that meet the needs of the entire
village community, and strengthening of financial management capacity. This approach is consistent with
the state government's strategy to involve the panchayats gradually in development programs, and to give
hiigh priority to the social and economic development of poor communities. It also fits well with the
-7 -



evolving relationships between community organizations, PRIs, elected legislators, and civil servants.
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). The project allocates several important roles to
NGOs, who would be selected on the basis of agreed criteria and processes (see Selection of NGOs, Annex
2, Attachment 2). NGOs supporting the project would be expected to have a good track record of working
with the poor, and to be accepted by the participating communities. They would be engaged by the project
management to mobilize and organize communities, and would therefore employ the Community
Facilitators in collaboration with the beneficiary communities, train and assist them. There would be
several CFs in each district, according to need, and they may work individually or in teams in each village
community. The same or other NGOs would undertake the training or other capacity-building activities, or
provide technical/managerial assistance to CIGs/VDAs for sub-project implementation and linkages with
financial institutions where relevant. NGOs who are willing to do such work, but lack adequate skills or
facilities, would be assisted by the project to develop appropriate capacity, in keeping with the project's
focus on building institutional capacity to address poverty in backward districts.
District Project Managenent Units (DPMVs). Project support at the district level would be
provided by proactive field units, the District Project Management Units. Each DPMU would have a
District Project Manager (DPM), a senior professional for each of the following functions: Training and
Comnmunity Development, Sub-Project Appraisal, Monitoring and Learning, and Accounts/Administration,
and other support staff as needed. The DPMUs would be autonomous district-level units in the state's
Rural Development Department, and responsible to the State Project Management Unit (SPMU), referring
to it as needed, reporting according to a pre-defined time and task schedule, and obtaining necessary
support from it. The DPMU would be responsible for planning and managing project activities at the
district level and below, including: disseminating information to motivate the village poor, recruiting
NGOs; organizing training; sub-project appraisal; and support activities. The DPMUs would be
responsible for technical and financial appraisal of sub-project proposals, for making adequate funds
available on a timely basis to the village groups, and for ensuring implementation/completion of
sub-projects. They would maintain a roster of experts who would provide sector-specific technical
assistance to CIGs/VDAs when the latter request it, and to the project at large.
Project moneys would flow from the SPMU into Community Investment Funds (CIFs) at the
district level to be readily available for community activities. The DPMUs would manage the CIFs and
lhave powers to accord technical and financial approvals to sub-projects up to US$30,000 equivalent.
Above this cost, sub-project proposals would be sent to the SPMU for consideration as they would require
the approval of the Bank. Funds for approved sub-projects would be passed on to CIGs and VDAs under
terms set out in a Sub-Project Agreement with the DPMU, and in accordance with procedures described in
the section on Project Financial Management System below in Annex 6, and in the project's Financial
Management Manual. Over time, authority to make small investments would be devolved by DPMUs to
lower levels, according to local capacity to manage such funds. The DPMU would also be responsible for
forward planning of the project in the district, environmental, technical, and cost-benefit analysis of
sub-projects, and, for contracting out/overseeing the continued social assessments to identify new areas,
additional target group, and activities. Implementation of all project activities would be monitored by the
DPMUs.
District Project Coordination Committees (DPCC) would be established to ensure that
DPIP-financed activities are coordinated with the on-going or planned activities of line departments and
panchayats and do not duplicate or conflict with interventions under other schemes. Another key role
would be to ensure that the various project-related entities collaborate and, wherever appropriate, that
synergies are achieved between them. This mechanism is intended to improve the responsiveness of local
service delivery institutions to the poor in the short term, and to assist in the transfer of successful project
experience across agencies for greater project impact and sustainability. Each DPCC would be headed by
-8 -



the District Collector (who is also Executive Director of the Zilla Parishad ), and include the Zilla
Pramukh or her/his nominee, the DPM, key District Line Officers, and representatives of participating
NGOs, CIGs and VDAs. The DPCC would be a small body (10-15 members) with two-thirds non-official
and one-third official members. A democratic process overseen by the SPMU would be followed to
identify members of the DPCCs, choosing those who support the principles and values of the program.
The DPCC would ensure that the project maintains its community orientation and non-governmental
involvement at all times.
State Project Management Unit (SPMU). The State Project Management Unit is envisaged as a
lean entity -- a small group of managers and professionals. It would be part of the GOR's Rural
Development Departnent, headed by a State Project Director (SPD), and staffed by an experienced
professional for each of the following functions: Training and Community Development, Sub-Project
Appraisal, Financial Control (heading the finance and accounting function), Financial Management,
Monitoring and Learning, and other support staff as needed. It would oversee the functioning of the
District Project Management Units. Its main roles would be: to facilitate and coordinate project activities
across all project districts; staff recruitment; organizing cross-cutting activities such as workshops, study
tours, exclhange opportunities; leading strategic and policy dialogue with other agencies of the state
government and taking up project-related issues that arise across districts; ensuring timely and adequate
funds flow to the districts and maintaining the project's financial management system; providing assistance
to sub-project appraisal, environmental assessment, and gender-related activities; and monitoring and
learning, including contracting periodic independent evaluations.
Governing Council and Empowered Committee. The project as a whole would be overseen by a
Governing Council (GC) headed by the Minister of Panchayati Raj and Rural Development, consisting of
15-20 members, one-third official and two-thirds non-official. Its role would be to set policy for, oversee
and guide the project to ensure that project objectives are met. The GC would take up policy-related
project matters with other entities in government or in non-govermnental forums. An Empowered
Committee of the state government, headed by the Chief Secretary and including the Development
Commissioner, Secretary Finance, Secretary Rural Development, Secretary Panchayati Raj, Secretary
Planning, and Special Secretary DPIP (State Project Director), would be responsible for ensuring
implementation of policy decisions, providing the necessary financial authorizations for the project, and
ensuring the collaboration of other government departments.
K4ey Implementation Approaches
Training. The project's capacity-building strategy is described in Annex 2, Attachment 3. The
basic premise is that building a wide range of institutions which are inclusive and appropriately skilled
would contribute greatly to poverty reduction and its sustainability. Initially, the capacities of project staff,
NGOs and CFs to plan and carry out community-driven development would be enhanced. CFs, NGOs and
DPMUs would then be responsible for providing information to communities about the project, and
building and strengthening CIGs and VDAs among them. Further, this component would develop the
capacities of other local institutions (PRIs, line departments, private agencies) to assist community-driven
development, and improve technical capabilities where these are inadequate to meet the needs of the poor in
a given sub-sector. Local private entities are included because they are expected to participate in the
project at the behest of communities who would contract works and services to them.
District Capacity Assessments were carried out during project preparation, covering line
departments (staffing, budgets, training needs, etc.), panchayats, and NGOs in each district. While certain
aspects were found to be common across all districts (such as the type of formal training being carried out
and resources available for it), other parameters were district-specific. The ensuing strategy emphasizes
the nieed to decentralize capacity-building and tailor approaches to local needs. Numerous NGOs, line
-g



department officers, panchayat and community representatives participated in the Social Assessments,
District Capacity Assessments and project preparation. The project would continue to build this
constituency to promote the principles and approaches of the project, and strengthen institutions to
implement the project and carry out project-related training of government and non-governmental personnel
and communities.
Preparation, Appraisal and Financing of Sub-projects. The major portion of project investment
would be determined by sub-project proposals submitted by CIGs, VDAs and Gram Panchayats for
financing from the Community Investment Funds (CIF), operated by the DPMUs. On receiving a proposal,
the DPMU would check its compliance with agreed eligibility criteria and a negative list, which are given in
Annex 2, Attachmenit 4. If it complies, the sub-project would be appraised. The approach to appraisal is
described in Annex 2, Attachment 5. The DPMU would establish a multi-disciplinary Panel of Experts
(individuals or firms) to undertake social, technical, environmental and financial appraisal of sub-projects,
and would return its approval (or reasons for rejection) to the proposing institution within fifteen days. It
would enter into a Sub-Project Agreement with the institution. A format that identifies, inter alia, the type
of sub-project, the works and goods to be financed, and the cash or kind contribution from beneficiaries has
been agreed and included in the Project Operational Manual (Annex 2, Attachment 6). Financial appraisal
would be done both before and after sub-project implementation, i.e., by review of the proposed
budgets/cost estimates as well as a review of actual expenditures. The latter would be carried out by the
community groups as well as by the DPMU. The SPMU would examine sub-project costs and
expenditures on a sample basis.
Eligibility Criteria for Sub-Projects. The eligibility criteria and negative list would be publicized
so that participating communities know and understand them. Technical departments would also be aware
of them and would be responsible for ensuring compliance where they are involved. In addition to criteria
for sub-projects, eligibility criteria would be established for implementing agencies, including community
groups, NGOs, private sector and government agencies.
Beneficiary contributions are a requirement to confirm demand and ensure sustainability of
investments. Participants' commitment to the sub-project of their choice is expected to be expressed
through up-front cash, kind or labor contributions. The level of contribution would be sector-specific and
not less than l 0 percent of the total sub-project cost. The costs of operation and maintenance (O&M) of
project-created assets would be wholly the responsibility of communities; or, where assets originate from
sub-projects put forward by GPs, or are transferred to them, the costs of O&M would be provided by the
local governiment.
Community Investments. Examples of the types of sub-projects that are likely to be financed
include: economic infrastructure such as village approach roads, community water and sanitation schemes,
mini-irrigation works, pavements and marketplaces; social infrastructure such as village health posts and
literacy centers; training and equipment for services such as animal husbandry; or micro-enterprise
development. A sub-project could include capacity building that is managed by the group itself. A group
could choose to implement a sub-project itself or engage contractors. Where the work is undertaken by the
group, technical assistance and quality control could be provided by technical staff of a line department or
other identified sources. It is expected that sub-projects proposed by GPs would be mainly for community
infrastructure extending across more than one habitation. They would nevertheless have to meet all
eligibility criteria. Proposals for infrastructure would be discussed and agreed by GP and CIG
representatives in the VDA to avoid duplication and to ensure that proposed investments would benefit the
poor. Water-related sub-projects, such as drinking water supply, water harvesting structures and
community drainage systems, would not in any way affect the quantity or quality of the waters flowing to
any of the streams and rivers that are tributaries of the Ganges River, because none of the sub-projects
- 10-



would be in the catchment areas of those streams and tributaries. All activities are intended to meet the
needs of poor people, and would be community- based and community-managed. They would also be
subjected to environmental screening, assessment and mitigation, as described in Annex 2, Attachment 7.
During the first two years of the project investments in infrastructure would be limited to 40
percent of the funds available annually in the CIF. After that the situation would be reviewed and
allocations adjusted to ensure that other proposals from CIGs are not being crowded out by investments in
infrastructure. The CIFs would not have a fixed size -- funds would be transferred to each on the basis of
demand and utilization to encourage competition between districts. However, to ensure that no district
gains an unfair advantage over the others, the total amount to a district would be limited to 30 percent of
the funds in the CIF component over the life of the project.
The eligibility criteria, sub-project appraisal process, beneficiary contribution rates, sub-project
agreement, technical specifications, procurement and other implementation procedures are set out in the
Project Operational Manual which has been discussed and agreed with GOR. The Manual would be
revised from time to time (as agreed with the Bank) to reflect project implementation experience and the
evolving needs of the poor.
Coordination with District Plans and Additionality. Project funds would be additional to district
developmenit funds (including those channeled through panchayats ). Interventions financed by the project
are expected to differ significantly from on-going activities on account of the participatory and
community-managed dimensions, and because the project approach encourages full financing of activities
as well as follow-on proposals to optimize the impact of investments. There is unlikely to be duplication
with on-going anti-poverty programs, but the use of funds provided, for example, through Swarnjayanti
Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) could be coordinated productively to support project objectives.
Responisibility for ensuring that project investments are additional and not substitutes or marginal
supplements to on-going district programs would rest, importantly, with the structures above and below the
district level, i.e., the State PMU and community committees, in addition to the DPMUs, DPCCs, District
Administrationis (Collector) and Zilla Parishads.
Over the long term, the project is expected to influence other programs aimed at the poor. The
project's institutional arrangements (especially the VDAs and DPCCs) are designed with this in mind. As
these institutions become established, they would exercise increasing influence over other activities in the
villages. Success in this project would encourage them to promote the use of community demand and
decision-making processes in the allocation of resources from a number of different programs, including the
state- and centrally-funded anti-poverty schemes. Thus, the impact of DPIP would include the spread of its
methiods to othier programs, and potentially throughout the state. The process of rationalizing the numerous
anti-poverty schemes has already been started by both GOI and GOR, and it is expected that the experience
of DPIP would contribute to finalizing a discrete and complementary cluster of programs which are
effective in reducing poverty because they harness the capabilities and meet the needs of the poor.
Participatory Monitoring and Learning. Monitoring and learning (M&L) are critical in this
project to plan, track, and make mid-course corrections, as well as to assess its impacts. The M&L system
would involve and be used by all actors in the project from poor clients to NGOs, project managers, and
the Bank, to learn about on-going activities, achievements, gaps and failures. The main elements of the
system are: (a) computerized performance tracking; (b) participatory process monitoring; (c) development
audit; and (d) impact assessment. Details of the M&L system are given in Annex 2, Attachment 8. The
first activity, part of the impact assessment, would be a baseline survey (BLS) conducted in a sample of
project and non-project villages/families by an independent agency experienced in quantitative and
qualitative evaluation of field programs similar to DPIP. Towards the end of the project, the impact
assessment would be similarly contracted out.
- 11 -



The task of setting up the broader monitoring and learning system for the project would be carried
out in several stages. The initial focus would be on developing a strategy, including formats, procedures
and methods, for elements (a) to (c) listed above. The strategy would emriphasize the importance of
self-assessment by beneficiaries, in particular, of group processes, skills, decision making capabilities and
sustainability. The SPMU would work with a selected agency to develop the computerized tracking system
and engage an independent agency to develop and undertake the process monitoring. The second stage
would be to develop an M&L manual (including reporting formats), the software package and training
modules for project staff, NGOs, CFs and community groups. These stages would be completed by project
start-up. Responsibility for operating the performance tracking system would be with the project units at
district and state levels. Process monitoring would be carried out by CIGs and CFs on a continuous basis,
with the assistance of the outside agency.
Another dimension of project learning would be cross-learning among the three proposed DPIP
states -- Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan. As the objectives and basic design of these
three projects are similar, it is planned to share information on their implementation experiences, and
transfer strategies, procedures and instruments across locations. This process occurred throughout project
preparation (e.g., through joint workshops, exchange visits of project planners, shared membership of the
Bank task teams) and would continue to be fostered by the individual states as well as the Bank. Other
mechianisms for sharing would include dissemination of reports, joint study tours, and common consultants.
The Bank would also organize multi-state events during supervision missions.
Reporting and Mid-term Review (MTR). The SPMU would submit to IDA a six-monthly
progress report and a comprehensive annual report. The six-monthly reports would consist of: (a) physical
and financial expenditure data; (b) a progress report on performance indicators; (c) successes and problems
encountered, witlh suggested remedial actions; (d) socio-economic and environmental impacts; and (e)
progress against, benchmarks in implementing policy reforms. These reports would be in addition to the
quarterly Project Monitoring Reports (PMRs) which will be generated by the computerized financial
management system from the start of the project. The annual report would cover all quantitative and
qualitative aspects of implementation progress, including implementation plans for the following year.
The Mid-Term Review would be an in-depth assessment of progress and an opportunity to change
course wh-ere appropriate. As an input to the MTR, the SPMU would commission specific studies as part
of the M&L work on: (a) the effectiveness and efficiency of the institutional and implementation
arrangements; (b) the impact of the project's capacity building program, including the program to secure
credit for interested groups on the quality and performance of CIGs/SHGs and their access to credit from
the lending institutions; (c) fiscal impact on the state budget and effectiveness of DPIP; and (d) overall
impact of the project. The terms of reference for the proposed studies would be developed by SPMU and
amended as necessary based on comments provided by IDA. The SPMU would take responsibility for
contracting and managing consultants engaged for the proposed studies. The studies would be completed
and reports provided to IDA three montths before the MTR. The overall MTR report would include the
results of the DPIP Development Audit conducted in the second year of the project.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
During the early preparation of this project, which involved the Governrnent of India, the state
governments of Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, and the Bank, several alternatives were
considered.
Support to Existing Anti-Poverty Programs. The Bank could assist on-going anti-poverty
- 12-



programs such as the Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP, now combined with other programs
into the Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana, SGSY), a beneficiary-oriented credit program, or the
wage-employment creation, Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (JRY, now known as the Jawahar Gram Samridhi
Yojana, JGSY) or Employment Assurance Scheme (EAS). However, these programs are
centrally-sponsored and implemented throughout the country with limited state contributions and very little
beneficiary participation and would require major improvements to achieve significant poverty reduction.
These programs were the subject of the 1998 India Poverty Assessment, which concluded that they have
not reduced poverty to the extent needed.
A Larger, Specific Investment Project Early proposals for a poverty alleviation project
envisaged very a large (US $500 million) investment in a few selected activities. While this approach was
muIti-sectoral, it was not tailored to meet the many and locale-specific needs of the poor. Nor did it
develop the organizational framework to involve potential beneficiaries in the selection or implementation
of activities, to enhance ownership, accountability and sustainability. It was felt that the impact of such an
investment would be limited in much the same way as that of existing programs. A specific investment
project would have been implemented by one or more line departments, accustomed to implementing
top-down and target-driven programs.
A ' Traditional' Unisectoral Approach. Another option would be for the Bank to continue
financing only single-sector projects, as it has done to date. However, as discussed in Sections I and 2 on
CAS Objectives and Sector Issues, the need to address the multiple causes of poverty has often been
demonstrated in Bank-assisted projects, as well as in wider development experience in India and elsewhere.
Hence, the proposed project aims to address the needs of the poor across sectors, and focuses on developing
an integrated area- and people-targeted approach to poverty reduction. The focus on building alternative
institutions and influelncing the functioning of traditional structures and the way in which public money
flows are the key innovations of this proposed project.
The Panchayati Raj Model. This would be the 'democratic' alternative, as PRIs are elected by
tihe people, have the potential to respond to communities at the local level, and can be voted out if they do
not perforn well. However, the model would be problematic at the current time because panchayats
frequently do not represent the poor or excluded. Social structures may prevent adequate attention to the
poor. Decision-making is not transparent, and they have not yet learned how to manage resources. PRIs
hiave weak capacities for implementation, and fiscal devolution policies are still evolving. It would be to
establish a stable working environment because of the evolving relationship between PRIs, politicians and
thie bureaucracy.
The Social Fund M1odel would transfer funds to NGOs and other agencies working directly with
thie poor. It has the potential for better targeting to the poor and local adaptation. However, in the Indian
context, it is limited in scope because, although there are many NGOs in the state, they collectively cover a
fraction of the population, and few are found working in the most difficult areas. Long-term sustainability
is also at issue because the approach bypasses existing institutions such as PRIs. It is less likely to transfer
learning to other institutions, and even to poor communities as the institutions may create dependency
rather tlhan develop lasting capacities for self-help.
Alternative Institutional Arrangements. During project preparation, various institutional
arrangements were considered, e.g., management by the District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs),
on the one hand, or full implementation of the project by NGOs or by an independent Society, on the other.
The institutional arrangements arrived at represent GOR's and the Bank's joint agreement on what is most
likely to ensure: (a) full participation of the poor; (b) innovation; (c) partnerships for wider impact; (d)
sustainability; and (e) influence on other development programs. Project management was not placed in the
DRDAs, which are directly funded by the Central Government, in order to enhance its potential to involve
- 13 -



and impact other district and state-level departments. Importantly, the proposed project brings village
groups into focus, providing them with greater control as well as responsibility.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The three proposed DPIPs (Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh) are the first
multi-sectoral projects supported by the Bank in India and targeted exclusively at the poorest segments of
the population. They have nevetheless drawn on extensive experience in on-going projects. For example,
some projects, such as the Uttar Pradesh Sodic Lands Project, have shown how the poor themselves wish to
establish organizational structures and engage in multiple activities in order to mitigate risk and participate
more fully in development. Several Bank projects have sought to involve beneficiaries in planning and
implementation, and have shown how communities will contribute towards investment and operating costs
if they are assured a good service. Among the more successful are the Integrated Watershed Development
Projects, wlhich have dernonstrated the viability of a strategy based on the formation of user groups, their
potential to manage project activities, and the effectiveness of community contributions. Similar lessons
also emerge from the Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Projects. The
Forestry projects, particularly in West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh, have also demonstrated the potential of
community groups such as Joint Forest Management Committees, and the value of successful partnerships
between community organizations, NGOs and the Government. Some projects have encountered
difficulties of which this project is mindful, such as conflicts of interest in planning and implementation.
The institution-centered approach of this project seeks to place planning exclusively in the hands of
organized poor groups and to strengthen the responsiveness and abilities of agencies charged with
implementation.
Early preparation of the three proposed DPIPs was carried out jointly resulting in common
objectives and sirnilar basic designs. The experiences of on-going programs in each state were shared. An
important lesson from the UNDP-assisted South Asia Poverty Alleviation Project (SAPAP) in Andhra
Pradesh was that it is not enough to mobilize communities for social action -- they want economic
opportunities and need investments, alongside social development. Hence, the DPIPs seek to mobilize
communities and provide them the support to improve productivity. They also include support to develop
linkages with credit institutions to expand mnicro-enterprise opportunities. Another relevant lesson of
SAPAP was that NGO involvement must be selective and focused. These lessons were applied to the
specific situations in each state, resulting in some differences in project design. Nevertheless, the three
states all recognize the value of continued interaction, and several mechanisms are planned to promote
cross-learning during implementation (see the section on Participatory Monitoring and Learning).
In addition to lessons learned from India, the proposed project has drawn on Bank experience
elsewhere. Up to the end of FY96 the Bank had approved 51 Social Fund projects in 34 countries,
amounting to commitments of over US$3.1 billion. These were evaluated in 1998 and this project's design
incorporated lessons from some of them. In particular, the following aspects of project design have
benefitted from the findings of the evaluation: (a) the creation of a decentralized project management
structure with control over the sub-project approval to expedite decisions and minimize political
interference; (b) streamlined procurement and disbursement rules and regulations to ensure speedy
implementation; (c) competitive employment conditions for project management staff to attract and retain
competent and motivated individuals; (d) detailed Operational Manual, computerized MIS, standardized
financial management procedures, regular and rigorous auditing and quantitative and qualitative
evaluations of project outcomes, all aimed at ensuring transparency, accountability and development
effectiveness; (e) mechanismns for sectoral coordination that are flexible enough not to compromise the
- 15 -



independence and efficiency of the State and District PMUs; and (f) incorporation of physical and financial
sustainability criteria for sub-project eligibility, to ensure a continued flow of benefits.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The state government has been steadfast in its request for Bank assistance for a poverty reduction
project, whose importance has been expressed by senior ministers and bureaucrats. It has shown its
commitment to the project throughout preparation, completing several tasks which demonstrate both its
commitment and early readiness for implementation.
*   It identified project districts on the basis of poverty indicators, and subsequently conducted
extensive Social Assessments and detailed District Capacity Assessments in the selected
districts. These facilitated selection of priority blocks, village clusters and social groups for
project start-up, and the preparation of a plan to cover the districts during the project period.
The activities involved government officials, NGOs, other private institutions, and potential
beneficiaries, building wide support for the project.
*   It established a State Project Management Unit early in preparation, and has maintained this,
along with contact persons in each district. The SPMU has adequate office space and
equipment, and key staff have been recruited (the State Project Director, Finance Manager,
Training & Community Development Officer, Project Appraisal Officer, Monitoring and
Learning Officer). District Project Managers are also in place, and the district-level Training
& Community Development Offtcers, and Accounts Officers would be in position by project
start-up.
*   Building on its good track record of working with NGOs, it has selected a ftrst group for
project implementation, including community mobilization, group formation, and training
activities.
*   It has developed a comprehensive capacity building strategy and a plan for the first year, and
identified the lead institutions for capacity building activities. It has prepared a Project
Implementation Plan; an Operational Manual agreed with the Bank; the procurement plan for
the first year, including bidding documents for two NCB contracts, and typical bidding
documents for three types of works likely to be financed under the project; the Financial
Management Manual and software; and the Environmental Assessment Report. It has retained
consultants to implement the last two activities, and to further develop the Sub-Project
Appraisal guidelines.
*   It has included the overall project budget and counterpart funding in the annual budget for
Indian FYs 1999-00 and 2000-01.
*   It has constituted the Governing Council and Empowered Committee for the project.
In general, the state is committed to expanding participatory approaches and fostering grassroots
institutions, based on the experience of other programs. It is also accelerating decentralized development,
as demonstrated by its recent decision to hand over elementary education to thepanchayats.

5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
There is growing recognition that the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of development
programs are significantly enhanced if they are implemented using decentralized and participatory
approaches. There is great need in India to promote such approaches. The Bank's added value stems from
its wide related experience, particularly: (a) its international experience of decentralization, participation,
demand-driven rural investment funds, and social funds; (b) the large India portfolio, which offers
experience of participatory approaches in other states, in a range of sectors including land and water
development, water supply and sanitation, forestry, micro-credit, etc.; (c) the size of its lending, which is
large enough to address relevant policy issues and investment needs in a comprehensive manner; and (d) its
broad experience with policy issues in all the key sectors. Furthermore, Bank support for DPIPs in three
states simultaneously would greatly facilitate the sharing of information, and enhance the quality of each
project and their total value to India's development.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
0 Cost benefit    NPV=US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
O Cost effectiveness
* Other (specify)
The main benefits of the project would arise from human and social capital development and
economic activities that would result in better living conditions and higher incomes. The impacts of project
investments in social mobilization and group organization, capacity building, and knowledge and skill
transfers are not readily quantifiable. However, these would be the pre-condition for investing in public
infrastructure, services, and goods that would benefit about 350,000 poor families, enhancing their access
to the means of production.
Investment in Group Development and Capacity Building. The formation of effective groups,
anid investing in individual and institutional capacities could bring about multiple benefits, including
iicreased participation in economic activities, skill improvements for greater productivity, and improved
responsiveness and efficiency of public and private services (e.g., services provided by financial
institutions).
Econonic Viability of Sub-projects Supported by the Community Investment Funds. While
some investments from the CIF would serve as 'enabling' investments to improve the knowledge or skills of
the poor (e.g. demonstration of technologies, skill training, product exhibitions), most would generate
measurable benefits. To ensure that sub-project activities undertaken are economically viable, proposals
from the CIGs would be subject to a least return analysis (see Annex 4), which would ask how much the
produictivity of participants would need to be raised to make the investment worthwhile. Reference would
be made to the total sub-project investment per individual or per CIG, and the net incremental economic
return needed over a certain period of time to generate an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) above 12 percent.
A relatively quick and reliable judgment could be expected on whether to go-ahead. Since the scope of the
CIFs is not restricted to economic activities, multiple criteria would be used to assess viability. The overall
approach to sub-project appraisal is described in Annex 2, Attachment 5, and detailed guidelines are
incluLded in the Project Operational Manual.
Annex 4, Table I shows the analysis for a few typical sub-projects. More examples are given in
the Guidelines for Sub-project Appraisal in the Operational Manual. The examples shown estimate the
economic IRRs as ranging from 19 percent (cotton bed and cushion production) to 48 percent (training of
- 17-



para-veterinary workers). While these examples demonstrate the good potential of sub-project activities, it
would be too speculative to derive an IRR for the project as a whole, as it is not possible to anticipate the
composition of activities likely to be financed from the CIF. However, in global terms, assuming benefits
to 350,000 families, the project cost (CIF, Capacity Building and Project Management components) would
amount to approximately US$188 per family. Assuming that benefits were to start 2 to 3 years after group
formation, aii average annual increase in the economic net productivity per family of about US$25.3 per
year (equivalent to less than Rs. 100 per month) would allow break-even with an IRR of 12 percent. It is
expected that the project would yield higher benefits in most cases.
Rationale for Public Investment. Overall, the project is expected to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of public services for the poor in the selected districts, and to reduce poverty. It would give
high priority to capacity building, including social mobilization and empowerment, enabling the rural poor
to influence public services beyond the project as well. Typical investments from the CIF would enhance
community infrastructure, improve access to services, such as health and education, improve access to
capital and productive resources and remove specific disadvantages faced by the poor (e.g. lack of
information/transparency to overcome market imperfections).
2. Financial (see Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)
Fiscal Impact:
The total cost of DPIP would be US$ 124.8 million over a five-year period, of which US$100.5
million (80.5 percent) would be financed by IDA, US$17.7 million (14.2 percent) would be funded by the
state government, and US$6.8 million (5.3 percent) would be raised through beneficiaries' contributions to
sub-projects. Projected DPIP expenditures would amount to about 1.7 percent of GOR's current annual
expenditures on Social and Economic Services on average, and 2.8 percent in the peak year. It is expected
that expenditures on Social and Economic Services would remain constant as a share of Gross State
Domestic Product (GSDP) over the next five years, which would allow some increase every year as GSDP
grows, thereby creating space for DPIP expenditures.
In the long term, DPIP is expected to improve the efficiency of the state's spending on poverty
alleviation. Efficiency gains are expected through the careful targeting planned in this project, direct
transfers of funds, and reduction of overheads. Furthermore, success in implementing a demand-driven
approach could have spill-over effects to programs in other sectors. In the medium to long term this
improved efficiency will allow the fiscal space to be created to expand DPIP-type operations to other
districts.
Counterpart Funding. The state government would contribute about 15 percent of total project
costs as counterpart funds. This claim on its budget is considered manageable and would not cause undue
burden. During the five-year project period, the counterpart funding would range from about US$1.0
million to 6.0 million (Rs. 45 to 317 crores) per annum. Consequently, the requirement for counterpart
funds for the project in the peak year would be only 0.4 percent of the revenue expenditure under the Social
and Economic Services heads.
Beneficiary Contributions. About 5.3 percent of total project costs, equivalent to about 6.7
percent of the amount in the CIF, would be raised through community contributions, in cash, kind or labor.
The value of the latter would be monetized in accordance with appropriate guidelines. The total beneficiary
contribution amounts to US$6.57 million (about Rs. 34.3 crores) over the life of the project. It is expected
that at least 350,000 families would benefit from the project directly and additional families indirectly, who
- 18 -



would also be potential contributors to sub-project costs. Each core family would thus contribute a
maximum of Rs. 1,000 over the project period, or about Rs. 200 per year on average. This can be
compared with the expected minimum increase in beneficiary family income of about Rs. 1,200 per year.
Post-project Period. DPIP would require only minimal expenditures by government during the
post-project period. The project is not expected to have significant recurrent cost implications beyond its
life as most staff would be on contract. The incremental operation and maintenance costs of the small-scale
infrastructur-e investments are expected to be met by beneficiary cormmunities, wlhich would be ensured by
the sub-project appraisal process and agreements. Thus, there would not be a significant additional burden
on public expenditures for O&M in the future.
3. Technical:
The project would finance a variety of interventions, ranging from land development to water
resource management, horticulture and other agricultural activities, micro-enterprise development and
social services. The project would be flexible in terms of the activities financed, but strict in ensuring
adherence to core principles such as: the demand-driven nature of investments; community management
(both short and long-term) of activities; targeting to the poorest; and financial efficiency and accountability.
Activities would be carried out within the policy framework and general guidelines established for other
Bank-assisted projects in a given sector (modified where experience suggests this is necessary or
advisable). Sub-project appraisal would be informed by sectoral guidelines and would assess the
appropriateness of metlhods and technologies being used and their cost-effectiveness. Sub-projects could
draw on designs and standards already available in many sub-sectors, e.g., watershed development, rural
infrastructure. These would continue to be developed for new interventions, or when the scope of
intervenitionis clhanges, and refined on the basis of implementation experience.
4. Institutional:
4.1 Executing agencies:
The institutional arrangements for project implementation are described in detail in Section C4,
above. The main executing agencies are the CIGs, VDAs, Gram Panchayats, NGOs, District line
departments, and private agencies willing and able to work at the village level. The formation and
development of local grassroots organizations (the CIGs and VDAs) is the crux of the project. In addition,
the project design gives an important role to NGOs and local government bodies (panchayats) in
mobilizing, organizing and supporting poor communities to access resources. Both NGOs and government
line departments have roles in providing technical support to the CIGs, and private agencies would also be
engaged for particular purposes (e.g. construction of small infrastructure, marketing, etc.). In addition,
support structures such as the District Project Coordination Committees and panels of experts set up at the
district and state levels would work closely with the PMUs to broad base the project's ideas, approaches
and implementation strategies.
Even though Rajasthan has a vibrant NGO sector and several examples of productive collaboration
between NGOs and government, the availability and capacity of NGOs within the project districts is
variable. As the project design envisages important roles for NGOs in mobilizing communities, forming
and supporting CIGs, training and other activities, the DPMUs and SPMU would continuously identify
NGOs and assess and build their capacities. NGOs would be selected on the basis of criteria outlined in
Annex 2, Attachment 3.
- 19-



4.2 Project management:
Project management is the responsibility of the State Project Management Unit (SPMU) and seven
District Project Management Units (DPMUs) within the Government of Rajasthan's Rural Development
Department. The SPMU would facilitate the development of project strategies, plans, procedures, and
materials that can be commonly used across districts. It would also assist in the transfer of experience and
learning and promote competition between districts for innovation, quality of implementation, and the
effective utilization of funds. A focus on developing the DPMUs allows for the creation of strong linkages
between institutions/programs at the local level, which would promote sustainability. The DPMUs would
maintain the required operational autonomy and flexibility to respond to demand-driven proposals quickly.
Accordingly, they would:
* respond to the priority needs of poor communities;
* ensure the participation of representatives of poor communities in the district project
coordination committee;
* adopt streamlined administrative procedures for day-to-day management;
* develop effective convergence between development programs managed byPanchayati Raj
Institutions (PRIs), line departments and other local institutions;
* adopt a simple funds flow arrangement to allow direct transfers of funds to the community
groups implementing.sub-projects (see Annex 2 Figure 2).
4.3 Procurement issues:
The bulk of project funds would be in the CIF component to finance small sub-projects requiring
the procurement of works, goods and services costing less than US$ 30,000 equivalent. These sub-projects
would be implemented by communities or through direct contracting or by NGOs.
Since most procurement activities would be managed by the DPMUs, each unit would have a
trained full-time staff to handle the procurement work. As the formation of CIGs and hiring of NGOs
would occur continuously tlhroughout the project, workshops and seminars on procurement would be
organized at regular intervals to ensure good understanding of procurement procedures among district staff,
NGOs and beneficiary institutions. The State Project Management Unit would have a trained procurement
officer conversant witlh the Bank's procurement procedures, especially those related to small
community-based investments. He/she would also: (a) coordinate demands coming from the DPMUs; (b)
oversee updating of the procurement section of the Operational Manual which would serve as a reference
for procurement procedures applicable to different situations; and (c) standardize the technical details for
community works which would be used as an aid to the preparation and review of sub-project proposals.
4.4 Financial management issues:
Project Financial Management System (PFMS). Financial management arrangements for the
project are detailed in Annex 6. An FMS Manual has been prepared and an integrated computerized
financial management system is being developed. Computers for the SPMU and DPMUs have been
procured and installed. The next key tasks to be carried out would be: (a) installation of PFMS software,
expected to be completed by April 30, 2000; (b) full placement of FM staff at SPMU (a qualified
Chartered Accountant as a Finance Manager, and a Financial-Controller) and DPMUs (Accounts Officers),
expected to be completed by May 31, 2000; (c) training of staff in implementation of the PFMS, expected
to be completed by June 30, 2000. The PFMS is expected to be fully operational by July 1, 2000.
Flow of Funds. The Government of India would pass on funds to the Government of Rajasthan in
accordance with the prevailing system of fund transfers from the Center to the states as applied to
Bank-assisted state-sector projects. The state government would release funds to an interest-bearing
personal deposit (PD) account established for the project. The SPMU would transfer funds to the seven
- 20 -



DPMUs through banking channels based on their fund requirement projections and work plans. These two
mechanisms (the PD account and district bank accounts) would facilitate monitoring of the state
governmenit's provision of funds to the project, and protect allocated funds for project use. It is expected
that Rajasthan's fiscal reforms and the on-going dialogue between the Bank and GOI regarding fund flow
arrangements would facilitate financing (including counterpart funding) of the project. The flow of funds
from the DPMUs to beneficiary institutions would be based on the schedule in the sub-project agreement
between them, which would be structured to ensure that adequate funds are available in advance for all
operations. The CIGs would be required to maintain simple books of accounts recording all transactions
pertaining to the sub-project.
Disbursements. Disbursements from the IDA credit would initially be made according to the
traditional method (reimbursement with full documentation and against statements of expenditures) and
would be converted to disbursement based on Project Management Reports (PMR) after the successful
implementation of the computerized PFMS. The target date for this conversion is July 1, 2001.
Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing up to an amount of US$0.7 million equivalent
would cover eligible expenditures for activities after July 1, 1999, based on a Statement of Expenditure.
Retroactive financing would support consultancies which have been contracted by the SPMU to advance
thie Environmental Assessment, Sub-Project Appraisal and other work on the project, and some
establishment and operating costs of the SPMU and DPMUs.
Audii. The financial statements of the project would be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor
General of India (CAG) or his nominee. The Rural Development Department would prepare the financial
statements and reconcile the accounts with the State Accountant General's figures within four months of the
close of the Indian fiscal year. The audited annual project financial statements would be submitted to the
Bank within six months of the close of the Indian fiscal year. This report would be monitored under the
Audit Reports Compliance System (ARCS). An agreement would be reached between the CAG, GOR and
IDA onl the formats of financial statements and terms of reference for the audit. In addition, a CA firm will
carry out a review of internal financial controls on a quarterly basis, for which a terms of reference would
be agreed by GOR and IDA in consultation with DEA-GOI and the CAG by May 31, 2000.
5. Environmental:                 Environmental Category: B
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultationi and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
An independent agency was engaged by GOR to develop an Environmental Assessment Report
(EAR) oni the basis of the project design, available information on the project districts and likely project
investments. From an environmental perspective, the project component that would be of concern is the
CIF. Hence, an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) has been developed for the ClF.
The CIF would support both income-generating activities and infrastructure investments which, in
most cases, would be small-scale and hence not expected to cause environmental impacts of any
significance. All sub-project proposals would, however, be subject to environmental screening in order to:
(a) prevent execution of sub-projects with potentially significant negative impacts; (b) decrease potential
minor negative impacts through modifications in sub-project design, location or execution; (c) prevent or
mitigate negative impacts resuiting from cumulative small-scale investments; (d) enhance the positive
impacts of sub-projects; and (e) prevent additional stress on environmentally sensitive areas.
5.2 Wlhat are the main features of thie EMP and are they adequate?
To assist in meeting these objectives, the Environmental Assessment Report (EAR) sets out the
following: (a) a methodology and administrative structure for environmental management; (b) an
environmental capacity building and awareness raising program; and (c) an environmental supervision and
- 21 -



monitoring plan. The EAR is part of the Project Operational Manual. To ensure the effective
implementation of these measures, an Environmental Agency has been appointed by the SPMU. Further
information on the EMF and the proposed management arrangements is given in Annex 2, Attachment 7.
5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status of EA:
Date of receipt of final draft: February 29, 2000
The final draft of the EAR has been received.
5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?
As the specific project investments would be decided during implementation, environmental
screening of sub-projects would take place as part of sub-project preparation and appraisal. Beneficiaries
would be fully involved in sub-project preparation, and in the environmental reviews conducted by the
community facilitators. Local NGOs and the DPMU would be involved in sub-project appraisal and in the
Limited Environmental Assesments. Very few sub-projects are likely to require an Environmental Impact
Assessment, but it is expected that the consultants engaged to carry out EIAs would consult all
stakeholders in the process.
5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on the
environment9 Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
The terms of reference of the appointed Environment Agency include continuous monitoring of
environment issues and of awareness of project personnel. An independent agency would conduct an audit
of the implementation of the EMF every two years.
6. Social:
6.1 Suinmarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
The key issue in the project is its continuing need to ensure the participation of and attention to the
needs of the socially disadvantaged among the economically poor.
Women. It is recognized that women are disproportionately represented among the poor, and that
female-headed households are amongst the poorest. In addition, the gender division of labor and gender
differentials in access to resources and services have important implications in the project. Information
collected during the social assessments on the situation of women in the project districts and from
consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, including organizations and individuals who have been
involved in the state's Women's Development Program, women activists, researchers and others, was used
to formulate a detailed gender strategy for the project. The full strategy is part of the State's Project
lImplementation Plan and Operational Manual. Annex 2 Attachment 9 summarizes its key features. The
strategy aims to ensure gender equity in and through all project processes, including planning, staffing,
community mobilization, capacity-building, sub-project appraisal and investments, and monitoring and
learning. The project would ensure the participation of females as well as males and, where necessary and
feasible, take special measures to overcome gender-related handicaps (e.g., formation of women's groups;
attention to their health, education or child-care needs). A gender advisory committee would guide and
oversee the project, and women's resource centers would be established at state and district levels.
Scheduled Castes and Tribes, and Other Vulnerable Groups. The project would also focus on
other socially vulnerable groups among the economically poor including the Scheduled Tribes and
Scheduled Castes. The approach adopted by the project also allows interventions to be made for groups
- 22 -



such as the disabled, destitute widows, etc. While social disadvantage would be a criterion for the
formation of certain groups and activities, it is expected that all groups formed would be assisted through
economic interventions. Attention would be paid to ensuring that the natural resource base, on which the
livelihoods of many poor people (especially tribal groups) are founded, is protected and developed rather
than eroded. Indigenous forms of community action would be encouraged where these are useful to assist
poverty reduction. As several project districts have significant tribal populations, a Tribal Development
Plan has been formulated to address their needs. The full plan is contained in the Project Implementation
Plan and attached to the Minutes of Negotiations. Annex 2 Attachment 9 summarizes its key features. The
project aims to cover all tribal villages in the districts.
The Right to Information. The project is predicated on a participatory approach, for which
information dissemination is critical. Beneficiaries would receive information to participate in the initial
processes (e.g., group formation, preparation of proposals), and they would also be informed continuously
about project-related services, opportunities,etc. The involvement of Panchayats (at all levels) would be
an important aspect of participation, and their roles in the provision of information, decision-making and
management of the project would be built carefully. The project also includes a social audit mechanism --
development audit, and the learning system would ensure that participants and village communities have
access to information about project progress, achievements, expenditures, and effectiveness at all times.
Dealing with Community Divisiveness. The most difficult social issue which the project is likely
to face is that of community divisiveness. It would be difficult to assist the poor unless the better-off are
convinced of the common good, and agreeable to the proposed interventions. The project would attempt to
ensure adequate support from groups who would not benefit directly (or who may even lose benefits by
project interventions or their success) through public consultations and by establishing a close working
relationship between the CIGs and Gram Panchayats who very often represent the interests of the
better-off in a village.
Land Provision for the Construction of Rural Roads and Small Infrastructure. The CIF
provides for communities to undertake improvement of inter-habitation roads and small civil works. In
some cases, the work may require small amounts of land. This would most often be public&land
(government or panchayat owned), but in some situations private land may be needed. It is common
practice for such land to be given voluntarily, without compensation, because of the strong private and
community interest in improving road linkages and infrastructure. It has been agreed that a Memorandum
of Understanding (which has been attached to the Minutes of Negotiations and is included in the Project
Operational Manual, along with the procedure to be followed) would be signed between the District
Collector or his nominee, the Gram Panchayat and the land owner(s). Construction would be started only
after unanimous agreement among all parties. The purpose is to ensure that vulnerable people in the
community are not disadvantaged by the land transfer/use, and the procedure would emphasize a
transparent public consultation process. Close attention would be also be paid to this aspect in the
independent monitoring, to ascertain that land contributions are made voluntarily
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
The primary beneficiaries of the project would be poor rural people, organized into Common
Interest Groups. The project design calls for them to participate in the identification, planning,
implementation, operation and maintenance of all activities at the local level. This would also involve the
participation of other civil society institutions such as NGOs and panchayats, whose roles are described in
Sections C4 and E4 above.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
- 23 -



Consultations were held during project preparation with a broad cross-section of poor
communities, a number of NGOs andpanchayats. These would continue during the project to further
develop project modalities and procedures, as well as to expand an interested and supportive constituency
for the project. NGOs also conducted the social assessments and the district capacity assessments, and
participated in the preparation of project strategy and plans. As described in Section C4 NGOs would be
key agencies in the implementation of the project.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
See Section C4.
6.5 How will the project monitor perfornance in terms of social development outcomes?
See Section A2, Key Perfonnance Indicators.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
There are three dimensions to sustainability in DPIP: that of sub-project investments; of DPIP
structures; and of the project as a whole. The sustainability of sub-project investments is assured by the
requirements that O&M arrangements be planned and agreed during sub-project preparation, and that
contributions for O&M be collected during implementation. No other liabilities would be created by the
project. Sustainability of the project approach would depend largely on the extent to which the capacities
of the poor and PRIs are successfully built and strengthened, and changes in modus operandi are brought
about in line departments. Not all DPIP structures (e.g., CIGs, VDAs, DPMUs) have to survive the
project. The design provides for them to be institutionalized, or to disappear once the demand-driven and
community-based service delivery approach demonstrated by DPIP has been absorbed by agencies such as
PRIs and line departments. These institutions would then be expected to operate more efficiently and
equitably. If the project is successful, it is expected that it would be scaled up with resources available to
the state government, possibly reallocated from other programs.

Annex 2
Attachment 1
Formation and Development of Common Interest Groups (CIGs)
Introduction
The key contributors to the mobilization and development of CIGs at the village level would be
Community Facilitators (CFs). As their role is critical, considerable attention is necessary to select persons
with appropriate skills, qualifications, motivation and commitment. The CFs would be contracted by a
suitably-selected NGO operating in the area. The CFs may be recruited from the open market on a
competitive basis or, in some instances, selected from among staff already working in the NGO (or even
government) program. Efforts would be made to select a person from the village(s) in which s/he would
work, or from an area nearby, to increase cultural and geographic familiarity. The CFs would receive
training in social mobilization (facilitation skills, formation of new groups, strengthening of existing
groups, group management, financial management, and group training). In the first year they would work
on developing a dialogue with the poor in their habitations, training group leaders and members, etc. Given
the intensive work required to build cohesive and stable groups, CFs are likely to need continuous support
from the NGO. Hence the NGOs would be engaged on contracts long enough to provide the necessary
facilitation, training and management for CFs in a given area (cluster of villages/block).
Formation of Common Interest Groups
The social assessments selected villages (on the basis of poverty criteria) in each district that would
be covered in the first year of the project. The number of first-year villages varies from district to district.
Areas of operation (blocks) were also selected for later years in the project, and these would be revalidated
during the project. The CFs would conduct several rounds of dialogue with the village poor, identified on
the basis of criteria established by the project and discussed in a gram sabha or other village meeting.
Emphasis would be given those who have not been organized through any past program and are not
members of any existing groups. As the 'excluded' poor are often very difficult to access, contacts would
be made with the help of village agencies, the Gram Sabha, etc. During this process the commnunity would
be encouraged to identify sincere and committed people who could initiate the processes of CIG formation
and become members of CIGs themselves. These persons would also receive training in social mobilization
and group building. The CF and the NGO would conduct training, using modules developed for the
purpose. In addition, training would be provided to group members at the habitation level, also by the CF
and NGO. The best groups would be identified and developed as resource groups, to which the members of
the other groups in the area could be brought on exchange visits.
During the process of group development, qualified and committed group members/leaders would
be identified and trained as habitation-level leaders and trainers. They could be paid stipends by the CIGs.
The project would assist with some incremental expenses related to group meetings, materials and training.
These leaders would take over more and more responsibilities for sustaining groups within their habitation.
They would also assist CFs with new groups as these are formed. As a strong cadre of village group
leaders is developed, CFs would transfer responsibilities for day to day support of the CIGs to them. At
the same time they would enlarge their own area of coverage to newer habitations and channel their efforts
to developing new groups, performance improvement of existing.groups, and preparation of sub-project
proposals for financing under the CIF. During this work they would pay attention to motivating and
training committed group leaders as trainers for the development and support of new groups in subsequent
- 39 -



years.
Performance improvement of CIGs
In parallel with the development of new groups the CFs would identify existing groups and would
work on improving their performance with the help of other NGO staff. This would include awareness
building, training, improvement of access to commercial credit, and support in the preparation of
sub-projects. The same activities would become part of a continuing support program for those CIGs
which have been newly created under the project.
Both existing groups in the project areas as well as groups created under the project would benefit
from a comprehensive and continuing program of group performance improvement, awareness building,
and training. To strengthen group awareness, each group would be exposed to educational campaigns
during the year on subjects such as child nutrition, health, sanitation, reproductive health, animal health,
soil and water conservation, etc. All groups would undergo regular performance rating with the objective
of improving their management and performance in ways that the group would become qualified for
commercial bank lending. The exact nature of support to be provided to existing groups would be decided
on the basis of the performance rating of each group.
Proposed role of NGOs
NGOs would play an important role in forming and sustaining CIGs. In areas where capable
NGOs are available, they would be contracted to take on the full responsibility for managing the
development of CIGs and VDAs in the villages, including engagement of CFs. In other areas, where
suitable NGOs may not be available to take this broad responsibility, strong NGOs from adjoining areas
could be contracted to undertake mobilization and/or provide support on specific aspects, according to their
experience and location. Examples of such support are: group formation, awareness building, group
performance rating, conducting of training for CIGs, or handling special subjects such as account keeping.
Development of group resource persons
Based on group demand, and the nature of social/economic activities being undertaken by them,
group members would be given special training as para-technicians (e.g., in primary health care, veterinary
care, etc.). The training would be appropriately tailored to the groups, and would be held at the NGO or
district level. These trained resource persons would become the main contact persons for other group
members, and even for line department and private sector support personnel, to facilitate the transfer of
information to other members and CIGs.
Number of DPIP beneficiaries
The project would support about 60-80 NGOs to work in the project areas in about 7000 villages
(about 100 villages on average over the five-year period). As there could be multiple CIGs in each
habitation, atleast 10,500 CIGs are likely to be created in this time. In addition to the CFs, trained group
leaders and members could also assist to form new groups in time and to sustain them, with support from
the project. Assuming an average membership of 30-35 people per group, about 350,000 individuals, with
an average family size of five, would benefit from the social mobilization and organization process.
Discounting for about 1 0 percent 'double-membership' (i.e., members of the same family belonging to
different groups), the total number of beneficiaries is expected to reach about 1.6 million, or approximately
30 percent of the rural population of the seven districts.

Annex 2
Attachment 2
Selection of Non-Governmental Organizations
To ensure flexibility and responsiveness to the village poor, DPIP will involve NGOs as there is
nlow wide acceptance that they are an effective mechanism for mobilization and organization of people at
the grass-roots. Two main roles are envisaged for NGOs in the project: a Project Implementation role and
Capacity Building and Support. A Project Implementation NGO will be based within the district and
operate locally. These NGOs will have good understanding of the local culture and the socio-economic
conditions of the people in the area. They will carry out the following tasks:
* Establish contact with the community through suitable village entry programs;
* Build awareness about the project;
* Initiate processes of community mobilization;
* Form CIGs and nurture them;
*   Build the capacities of CIGs;
* Generate options regarding sub-project activities and assist CIGs in identifying suitable
activities and preparing proposals for them;
* Provide process related support;
* Access and provide technical support for sub-project activities;
* Ensure that the process approach is not overtaken by the target approach;
* Form and nurture VDAs;
*   Establish effective links between the CIGs/VDAs and the DPMU/SPMU;
These tasks would be carried out by Community Facilitators contracted by the NGOs.
Capacity Building and Support NGOs could take on training and capacity building, or provide
specialized support. They will have a high level of professional competence and personnel with a good
field experience, with training capability and/or specialized technical knowledge and skills. Capacity
Building and Support NGOs would normally be based in the district, but could also come from other areas.
They would be expected to be closely involved primarily with Implementation NGOs, but also with CIGs
and VDAs.
The NGO Selection Process
A fully transparent process will be used to identify, assess and select NGOs for the Project. The
roles and responsibilities of both the DPMU (and in some cases the SPMU) and the NGO would be laid out
clearly in a contractual agreement. The NGO identification, selection and contracting process will be
refined continuously through wide consultations at the state and district levels. State and district
workshops will serve the purpose of introducing the project to potential NGO partners, reviewing selection
criteria and processes, discussing key elements of the contract, support to be provided by the DPMU and
other agencies, and so on. The workshops will help to identify NGOs who are willing and able to work
with the project.
The selection process currently envisaged will follow a series of steps, and will adhere to the Bank'
s procurement guidelines.
Step 1 -  SPMU: Issue advertisement calling for expressions of interest in which interested NGOs are
requested to send information on their organization and experience
Step 2 -  SPMU: Set up an NGO Selection Group including the State Project Director or District
Project Manager of the concerned district, representative of the Lead Training agency, and
-41 -



two independent persons.
Step 3 -  NGO Selection Group: Develop parameters for screening (see below) and for detailed
assessment (including staffing, other resources, financial capability, etc.)
Step 4 -  NGO Selection Group: Screen NGOs and visit suitable NGOs to meet with their team,
assess the infrastructure and facilities, staff capacities, financial turnover and management,
and interest, based on the previously set parameters. In the event that no NGO is found
suitable the selection group will proactively approach some NGOs and/or develop capacity
building plans with 'almost suitable' NGOs
Step 5 -  NGO Selection Group: Shortlist NGOs definitely capable of working with the Project.
Invite these to become partners in the Project, requesting them to submit proposals
Step 6 -  NGOs: Submit technical and financial proposals and work plan to the Selection Group and
present the proposal
Step 7 - NGO Selection Group: Evaluate proposals and recommend selection to the DPMU.
Successful proposals go to Step 8. In the event that the technical and financial proposals are
not upto standard, the group provides detailed feedback to the NGO to facilitate
improvement of their proposals, or to rectify any other deficiency
Step 8 -  DPMU and NGO: Negotiate successful Technical and Financial Proposal and sign contract.
Proposed Screening Criteria
NGOs will be shortlisted using, inter alia, the following criteria:
* Legal Status: evidence of legal registration;
C Constitution: constitutional provision to engage in social/economic activities;
* Track record. at least three years experience in group formation and group-related
social/economic activities, or the specific activities for which they will participate in the
project; the NGO should not have been blacklisted at any time by CAPART, CSWB or other
relevant government agency;
*   Finance: accounts audited and certified by a chartered accountant for at least three years;
* Staff: staff capacity to carry out the proposed activities or demonstrated ability to procure such
capacity.
NGOs will be screened by the Selection Group on the basis of the above criteria prior to
short-listing. Thereafter, the processes listed above will be carried out.
Scoring System for Technical Proposals
In order to ensure the selection of optimally-qualified NGOs, a scoring system will be developed.
The NGOs will be independently assessed by at least three team members, and their average score used as
the basis for decision-making. NGOs not achieving at least 75 points out of 100 will be disqualified. The
following parameters will be included, and the points to be assigned are given. In addition:
* Suitability to providing direct services to communities (location, mobility, language skills, etc.)
(10 points);
* Geographical orientation and demonstrated loyalty to particular communities over a period of
time (10 points);
*   Experience of grassroots work, specifically:
Previous experience of social mobilization/group formation in rural areas (15 points)
Previous support activities in social and economic development (15 points)
Other activities related to rural development (5 points);
*   Methods and Skills:
Experience of using participatory methods and tools (15 points)
- 42 -



Financial and record-keeping skills (10 points)
General management skills (10 points);
* Continuity of leadership (10 points)
In addition costs would be considered (20 points) in following the Bank's Quality and Cost Based
Selection (QCBS) procedure.
Other Considerations
NGOs selected to work in a district will be represented on the District Project Coordination
Committee. The State Project Director will hold regular quarterly meetings with the NGOs working in the
Project to resolve any difficulties they may be facing or conflicts that may have arisen.

Capacity Building
Definition, vision and expected outcomes
Capacity-building (CB) is the process by which the abilities of target communities to plan and
manage development programs, and influence the economic social and political environment in which they
are implemented is increased; and those of the staff of governmental and NGOs to facilitate such efforts is
irnproved. Also, the capacities of the PRIs to plan and manage development activities and facilitate the
ernpowernent of the poor would be enhanced. The capacity-building process would consist of training and
networking initiatives, using participatory methodologies. Networking initiatives are non-module based
learning efforts that respond to project needs as they arise. These would include, for example, an annual
DPIP Conference bringing together all leading DPIP participants from the village to the state level, or
village fairs to increase the buy-in to DPIP concepts, processes and plans of the private sector and others
not directly involved in DPIP. Capacity-building under DPIP would develop the know-how and build
linkages, through joint programs, study visits, material development, etc., with institutions and facilitators
in the state, the rest of India and abroad to carry the vision forward.
The following are the expected outcomes of capacity-building in DPIP:
*   Empowerment of the target communities: i.e., their achievement of control over development
processes;
a Improved quality of services: i.e., greater responsiveness, innovation, transparency,
accountability, flexibility, and sustained participatory management and processes;
o Enhanced gender equity: i.e., greater involvement of women in development processes, based
on proper gender analysis, sensitization, etc.;
o   Participant learning: through feedback and analysis, and an impact on attitudes and
behaviours such as sharing trust, resposiveness and openess;
* Institutional change: intemalizing the new perspectives, decentralization, learning
partnerships, seeing government as a 'facilitator, not a provider';
*   Capacityfor participatory development: i.e., a cadre of facilitators sensitive to a more
inclusive approach to development, and with commitment to promoting participatory
mechanisms;
-   Innovation: new ways of addressing poverty;
*   Process documentation.
Guiding Principles
The capacity-building in DPIP would:
* be motivational and learner-centric;
*  be customized for different stakeholders;
*   include continuous capacity needs assessments and adaptation of curricula and activities to
these needs;
*   involve continuous learning support and extension, including counseling;
*   be on location, mainly at the point where participants have to apply their knowledge and skills;
*  be experiential - a minimum of theory and grounded in the experience of participants;
*   emphasize win-win outcomes ; and
*   create an environment that sustains the values, attitudes and operational changes being
emphasized by DPIP.
-44 -



Elements of Capacity-Building
Capacity-building aims to address the following aspects of the lives of target communities, staff,
NGOs, other implementing agency personnel and PRI representatives:
*  physical capacities;
*   relationships between co-workers, juniors and seniors, and, most importantly, staff and target
communities, stressing trust, respect, cooperation, and teamwork;
* attitudes and behavior toward the poor;
* awareness and knowledge of socially-sensitive approaches to development;
*  skills related to project implementation, including manual, technical, financial and managerial
skills;
*   opportunities for learning, including networking to share experiences and leam first-hand from
peers.
Capacity Building Modules
The capacity-building modules would include a Basic/Foundation Module (for all participants)
which provides: an understanding of the project, its vision and approach to poverty alleviation, and
comparison with other approaches; physical capacity-building; relationship development; and attention to
attitudinal shifts and required behavior changes. Sectoral modules (applicable to selected participants)
would cover knowledge enhancement for specific situations and skill development for identified activities.
Follow-up Modules would include refresher courses on identified issues, and advanced courses in skill
development and knowledge enhancement, applicable on the basis of the needs assessments. An indicative
list of focus areas in the sectoral and follow-up modules follows: Participatory Learning and Action;
Listening and Sensitivity; Gender Analysis, Equity and Participation; Project Management; Financial
Management; Sector-Related Capacity Building (e.g., micro-enterprise management); Group Organization
and development (for CFs and CIGs); Sub-Project Preparation and Proposals; Environment Management,
Monitoring and Evaluation. The details of these modules would emnerge from the needs assessments and
sub-projects.
Capacity-Building Process
The capacity-building process would consist broadly of the following steps. It would be responsive
to project participants' changing needs and requirements.
* List participant categories and indicative topics/subject areas in which they require CB;
*   Assess the number of participants in each category, and determine the best way to reach them,
e.g., for large numbers, through the training of Facilitators or, if the numbers are small, direct
CB modules delivered through a mobile CB team in each district;
* Prepare a database of CB resource persons, including Master Facilitators;
* Conduct Capacity Needs Assessments for each participant category to assess existing levels of
capacity and specific needs;
* Prepare modules;
* Organize participants and modules;
* Conduct modules.
-45 -



The modules would be designed by individuals or institutions with relevant experience. Basic work
on module design would be undertaken at the state level, and they would be field tested before being
produced and put to use. The overall process would intially be the responsibility of the State Capacity
Building Cell but is expected to be taken over rapidly by the district team, supported by consultants.
Methods
CB methods would:
* be flexible and participatory -- e.g., working groups rather than lectures, involving participants
as resource persons, shifting venues;
* bridge the traditional gap between project mnanagers and grassroots clientele, e.g., by involving
articulate and experienced village dwellers as resource persons, such as articulate village
women in gender sensitization of project managers and line department staff,
*  be adapted to illiterate and semi-literate people; visual materials, role plays/simulation and
experience-sharing and similar methods would be the norm, written materials would be used
mainly for managers and staff, and some methods such as study visits and experience-sharing
would be common to all.
Enhancing State Capacities for Capacity Building
In addition to building the capacities of people who would be involved in implementing DPIP in the
seven districts, the project would build capacity for participatory development in other organizations in the
state, which would then be utilized for the benefit of other development projects and beyond the project
period.
At the state level DPIP would build capacities in (a) the Indira Gandhi Panchayati Raj and Rural
Development Institute (IGPR&RDI), the lead capacity-building agency within which the State Capacity
Building Cell (SCBC) would be established; and (b) Aravali, the Association for Rural Advancement
through Voluntary Action and Local Involvement, which would develop the CB strategy, plans and many
modules for the project in partnership with IGPR&RDI. Aravali which has the potential to become a
leading capacity-building agency in the state is currently in its infancy, and would be provided with suitable
financial support to expand its current infrastructure and staff to carry out CB activities for the project.
At the district level, DPIP would support the establishment of district capacity building centers
(DCBCs) with suitable infrastructure and qualified staff. Each center would serve the CB needs of the
district. The management of these centers would be either with the SCBC or with an NGO in the district
chosen for the purpose, or a partnership between the two. For the duration of DPIP, the centers would
house the district capacity-building team that would coordinate and manage CB at the district level.
Post-DPIP the services provided by these centers would be chargeable and thereby able to generate
revenue.
PRI members are important stakeholders in the project to ensure the empowerment of target
communities. Hence, they would also be part of the vision-building for DPIP and undergo a short
structured program in village development planning. They would also have access to a support mechanism,
e.g., a resource center, where they would able to get information they require. These Panchayat Resource
Centers, would be based at the block-level and managed by NGOs. They would be set up collaboratively
by the district capacity-building team and the NGOs in the district. In the initial years the personnel
managing these centers would play a proactive role and reach out to the PRIs. Importantly, these centres
would serve the special needs of women PRI members whose capacity-building would be undertaken
separately to help them better understand their roles and responsibilities and be effective.
- 46 -



Management of the Capacity Building Program
A specially-organized DPIP capacity-building cell will be established by Aravali within the
lGPR&RDI in Jaipur to manage the overall capacity-building effort. The IGPR&RDI is an autonomous
organization set up by the GOR, with administrative links to the Rural Development Department. The
institute's primary responsibility is the training of PRI representatives in the state and from Indian FY
99-00 it also hosts the State Institute for Rural Development. The Minister for Rural Development and
Panchayati Raj is the Chairperson of the Institute and the Director is an Indian Administrative Service
officer. The institute has well-developed infrastructure, including a hostel.
The DPIP State Capacity-building Cell would be headed by a Capacity-building Coordinator. The
CB Coordinator would be a person from the non-governmental development sector, with suitable
experience of managing organizations, capacity-building, and development programs. S/he would have at
least 10 years of relevant experience, and an academic qualification in development. S/he would report to
the DPIP State Project Director for all program activities, and to the Director of the IGPR&RDI on
establishment matters. The funding for the capacity-building activities would flow to the IGPR&RDI. The
CB Coordinator would assume complete responsibility for the capacity-building program and also manage
the funds for this purpose. The CB Cell would have a core staff to plan and manage the CB activities, and
monitor the process and outcomes. The main job responsibilities of all key staff involved in
capacity-building at the state and district levels are given in the State Project Implementation Plan and
Project Operational Manual.
The SCBC would be responsible for undertaking the capacity need assessments, designing and
developing the modules, field testing them, and building the capacity of staff in the district
capacity-building teams. The SCBC would also be responsible for helping the districts develop materials
to be used in the modules and in the communication efforts. There would be some common materials that
could be used for all districts, and others that would be more specific to the needs of a particular district.
The SCBC would contract out the materials development, and other tasks as needed.
The district capacity-building teams would be the principal coordinators and managers of all CB
activities in the districts. The budget for capacity building would be provided against an annual CB plan
through the DPMUs, including the salaries of the district CB staff and operational expenses. The District
CB Coordinator would manage the funds for the Unit in accordance with the yearly plan. The district CB
teams would consist of individuals with participatory learning and action skills. Team members would be
carefully selected from the open market. They would facilitate the capacity-building of Community
Facilitators, technical staff, personnel selected by CIGs and VDAs to lead their groups and assist in
sub-project implementation, PRIs and DPIP staff. A large number of modules would be designed for use at
the district level, and another significant component of the CB strategy is continuing counselling and
support to field personnel. The capacity-building of CFs would be structured, intensive and continuous.
The district team would be trained to provide constant counseling and support to the CFs. In turn, the CFs
would build the capacities of the village-level institutions. Their performance would be constantly
upgraded through continuous needs assessment and refresher modules. The capacity-building of the district
teams themselves is an important aspect of the CB plan.
The district capacity-building teams, together with professional consultants from NGOs or
government would constitute the District Capacity-Building Support Units (DCBSU). There would be
atleast five professional persons in each unit. The DCBSU could be housed in a competent NGO with
relevant experience, or operated by the SCBC in the DPMU, if it is not possible to find a suitable NGO.
The advantage of such an approach is that the selected NGOs would be able to bring their own varied
experience into the project, which could be useful for building greater learning in and among the districts.
A spirit of competition between the SCBC-operated unit(s) and the NGO-operated units could be useful to
- 47 -



bring out the best in each. These NGOs would be identified with care by a committee consisting of
representatives of the SCBC, other NGO support organization, and a few experienced development
consultants, and the selection would be in accordance with the procedure laid down for NGO selection in
general.
The DCBSU would report administratively to the DPMU, but have a functional relationship with
the SCBC. The SCBC would guide the DCBSU, and provide it with the basic materials developed for the
required CB activities. The DCBSU would use the modules that have been developed and field tested by
the SCBC, modify them if required to suit local conditions, and implement them. The CB strategy
visualizes the DCBSU as a dynamic, proactive, extension unit that would assist field staff in the district to
undertake activities related to capacity building. The basic characteristics of the DCBSU would be: ability
to be responsive and flexible; its ability to plan well, and ability to function as an extension agency. For
capacity building to be effective, it would need good follow-up which requires the units to be self-contained
and have a strong support-oriented culture.

Attachment 5
Sub-Project Appraisal Process
Introduction
The project is expected to generate a large number of sub-projects which would be systematically
appraised to ensure their worthiness and highi benefits or rates of return. The process and criteria used for
sub-project appraisal, therefore, must be sound, and quick to ensure that the sub-project is implemented at
the cost estimated in the proposal.
Appraisal criteria and norms: 'Thumb rules'
The nature and objectives of DPIP call for sub-project appraisal to cover a number of areas.
However, it is not easy to practice multi-dimensional appraisal of small projects, especially at the district
level. Therefore. for each type of sub-project, certain simple but critical.appraisal parameters reflecting
key processes and results would be identified and their normative levels determined on the basis of a sample
of sub-projects. The norms wvould be in the form of 'thumb rules' which can be understood and applied by
project staff with some orientation and training to facilitate quick appraisal of sub-project proposals. The
parameters identified would indicate activities/performance critical for the achievement of sub-project
goals. and would be appropriate to the size of sub-projects. The following areas of appraisal would be
included.
Institutional Appraisal. The age, experience, human resource capacities, managerial capabilities,
cohesiveness. operational modalities, and financial (or thrift and credit) record of the CIG/VDA/GP would
be assessed before assessing the sub-project proposal per se. The complexity of the sub-project is expected
to match the technical and managerial capability of the group proposing it.
Social AppraisaL The expected social impact of each proposal would be assessed. Parameters
such as the percentage of beneficiaries expected to cross the poverty line, proportion of beneficiaries
belonging to social groups such as SCs, STs, OBCs, women, widows. female headed-households, and
plvsically handicapped persons, additional employment and income generated, and changes in the
conIsLinptioni patterns or quality of life of the beneficiaries would be relevant.
Participation Appraisal. Proposals would have to show how participation has occured in the
identification and preparation of the sub-project, and how it would occur in implementation and
management, monitoring and evaluation. operation and maintenance. Participation appraisal would also
assess the proposed arrangements for sharing ownership, and beneficiaries' commitment to the sub-project
as expressed through their contributions of cash, labor or materials.
Financial Appraisal. Financial viability would be assessed for each investment proposal related
to economic activities and small-scale infrastructure. To simplify financial appraisal, benchmarks for
investment costs per unit (e.g., costs per beneficiary households for roads, drinking water and sanitation,
etc.. or costs per hectare for irrigation infrastructure, horticulture, etc.) would be developed and used. For
micro-enterprises. a full cash flow analysis would be done.
Economic Feasibility. In addition financial viability, a separate economic analysis would be
undertaken when major inputs and/or outputs with distorted financial prices are crucial in the sub-project
proposal. An example would be water-pumping using subsidized electricity.
Technical AppraisaL Each sub-project would be checked for compliance with engineering and
techinical standards prescribed for local conditions, and consistency with national standards and
cost-effective construction/production methods.
- 50 -



Environmental AppraisaL An environmental checklist would be utilized for appraisal, including
impacts on natural resources, human safety, health risks, etc. as described in Annex 2, Attachment 7.
Sustainability and O&MArrangements. The sustainability of a sub-project would be assessed
on the basis of proposed O&M arrangements (a detailed plan and firm commitments) and surety of the
resources required for maintenance being generated by the beneficiary community. Activities such as
micro-enterprises would need to ensure continued linkages to raw material supplies, markets, etc.
Input formats
To facilitate quick sub-project appraisal, the agency making the proposal would furnish
sub-project details on a pre-designed computer compatible format so that the critical parameters could be
computed quickly and compared with their normative levels. To minimize human error in project selection,
each critical parameter would be assigned a value consistent with the overall project goals. Any
sub-project with a normative minimum score would automatically pass the appraisal test under each
category.
Database for appraisal
The DPMU would derive data on the costs and benefits, social, technical and sustainability
dimensions of sub-projects from the proposals sent up by CIGs or other agencies. Over time, to facilitate
quick appraisal of large numbers of sub-projects, a comprehensive data bank on different types of
sub-projects would be built in each district, using these data in addition to those generated by sample
studies.
Operational guidelines
The operational guidelines for sub-project appraisal would include: sub-project formulation and
format; methodology and process of appraisal; sub-project appraisal criteria, covering institutional, social,
participation, financial. economic, technical, environmental and sustainability appraisal and 'thumb rules';
case studies of sub-project appraisal, and information on the database on sub-projects. These guidelines
would be updated periodically.

Attachment 7
Environmental Assessment
From an environmental perspective, the project component that is of concern is the Community
Investment Fund. To address this concern, an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) has been
developed. To ensure the effective implementation of the framework, an Environment Agency (EA) has
been appointed by the State Project Management Unit. This summary presents the principle elements of
the EMF, and then briefly discusses the role of the EA. The Terms of Reference for the EA are included in
the Project Implementation Plan.
Environmental Management of the Community Investment Fund
The Community Investment Funds (CIFs) to be financed under the project would support both
income-generating activities and small-scale infrastructure investments. In most cases, the small scale of
these interventions means that they are not expected to cause envirornmental impacts of any significance.
All sub-project proposals would, however, be subject to an environmental screening exercise in order to:
*   prevent execution of sub-projects with potentially significant negative environmental impacts;
*   decrease potential minor negative impacts through modifications in sub-project design, location
or execution;
*   prevent or mitigate cumulative negative impacts as the result of multiple small-scale
investments;
*   enhance the positive impacts of sub-projects;
*   prevent additional stress on environmentally-sensitive areas.
To meet these objectives, an Environmental Assessment Report (EAR) has provided the following
inputs to the design of the overall project:
*   a methodology and administrative structure for environmental management;
*   an environmental capacity-building and awareness-raising program;
*   an environmental supervision and monitoring plan.
The requirements of the EAR would be included in the DPIP Operational Manual.
Methodology and Administrative Structure for Environmental Management
All sub-projects submitted for funding from the Community Investment Funds would be subject to
an environmenital screening process with the following steps:
(a)    Determination of tlte Level of Environmental Analysis Required Using the Environmental
Screeninig Criteria (ESC) included in the Environmental Assessment Report, the CF would determine the
level of environlmental analysis required. The options would be as follows:
*   Environmental Review (ER) -- to be applied to sub-projects considered to be environmentally
beneficial or benign;
*   Limited Environmental Assessment (LEA) -- required for sub-projects with minor potential
impacts;
*   Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) -- required for sub-projects with significant potential
impacts. In most cases these sub-projects would not be eligible for funding.
(b)    Environmental Analysis and Mitigation If the sub-project requires an ER, this would be
completed by the CF using the Environmental Review Guidelines, an environmental mitigation checklist
- 57 -



providing standard guidance for mitigation of potential minor environmental impacts. The completed
checklist would be submitted with the sub-project proposal to the District Project Management Unit for
review prior to sub-project approval.
In the case of sub-projects requiring an LEA, the DPMU would be responsible for ensuring that it
is conducted according to a generic TORs by a local consultant approved by the EA.
Sub-projects requiring an EIA would be forwarded for review to the SPMU's Project Appraisal
Officer, who would request an estimate of the EIA cost from the EA. Based on a comparison of this cost
with the expected economic benefits of the sub-project, the Project Appraisal Officer would decide whether
the EIA would be undertaken. or whether the sub-project would be denied DPIP funding.
Environmental Capacitv-building and Awareness-raising
One of the principal tasks of the EA appointed by the SPMU would be to provide adequate training
to allow the CFs, DPMU and SPMU staff, and approved local environmental consultants to fulfill their
environmental responsibilities. To meet this goal, the EA would prepare four training courses as follows:
* Environmental Awareness-raising for DPIP Beneficiaries;
* Basic Environmental Screening and Mitigation for Community Facilitators;
* Environmental Screening and Mitigation for DPMU and SPMU Staff.
- Limited Environmental Assessment for Environmental Consultants.
These courses would be prepared and delivered in close consultation with the SPMU Training Officer and
the State Capacity-building Cell.
Environmental Supervision, Monitoring and Auditing
(a)    Environmental Supervision. Supervision of EMF implementation would be conducted at two
levels. At the district level. as part of their overall supervisory responsibilities, the DPMU staff would be
required to verify that CFs are correctly using the environmental screening and mitigation checklists and
guidelines, and that the environmental mitigation measures included in the approved sub-project proposal
are implemented. The DPMUs would verify these matters for the same sample of sub-projects as they use
for other supervisory requirements, and the results would be included in their overall supervision reports
provided to the SPMU. These supervision reports would be submitted to the EA for review of EMF
implementation.
At the state level. the EA would conduct six-monthly supervisions of EMF implementation,
selecting a representative sample of ER, LEA and EIA category sub-projects. The EA would verify
whetlher the screening process was correctly applied, suitable mitigation measures specified, and the
measures correctly implemented. The supervision report, to be submitted to the State Project Director,
would include recommendations for improving either the EMF approach, or its implementation.
(b)    Environmental Monitoring. It would be the responsibility of the EA to remain abreast of
changing environmental conditions and emerging environmental concerns in DPIP areas. This would not be
achieved through the collection of primary data, but rather through monitoring information collected and
provided by government and civil society sources. On the basis of this information, the EA would
recommend revisions to the EMF, and highlight local concerns to the DPMUs. Details of changing
conditions. emerging concerns. recommended revisions, and local issues would be included in the
six-monthly supervision reports provided to the State Project Director.
(c)    Environmental Auditing. To provide an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the
design and implementation of the EMF, once every two years the State Project Director would contract an
environmental audit of DPIP. to be conducted by an independent civil society organization. The principal
- 58 -



focus of the audit would be to assess the extent to which the EMF has lead to the implementation of
appropriate environmental mitigation measures in DPIP sub-projects, and has promoted the implementation
of environmentally-beneficial sub-projects. A secondary goal of the audit would be to attempt an
assessment of the extent to which the DPIP may have led to improvement or deterioration in environmental
quality.
Role of the Environment Agency
At the state level, the SPMU would appoint an EA to undertake a range of environmentally-related
activities. The mission of the EA would be to:
*   prevent environmental degradation as a result of either: (a) the cumulative effect of many small
DPIP investments that individually have a negligible impact; or (b) the impact of individually
harmful sub-projects. This duty would be fulfilled without imposing an unnecessary
administrative burden on the DPIP;
*   promote the implementation of sub-projects that would be expected to lead to improvements in
local environmental quality; and
* build capacity for environmental management at the local, district and state levels.
In order to achieve this mission, the EA would undertake six principal tasks:
* the design and provision of training in environmental management;
*   supervision of the implementation of the Environmental Management Framework of DPIP;
*   monitoring of environmental conditions to ensure that the EMF remains responsive to
environmental concerns;
*  estimation of the cost of undertaking specific sub-project EIAs as requested by the SPMU;
*  specific sub-project ElAs which may be requested by the SPMU, but undertaken under
separate contracts;
-   the provision of ad hoc technical support on environmental issues, as requested by the SPMU
or DPMUs.

Attachment 8
Monitoring and Learning System
Objectives, design, and expected results
The project emphasizes the need to build ownership of the monitoring and learning (M&L) system
among potential users, and proposes to accomplish this by involving project managers, NGO implementors,
and intended beneficiaries in the detailed design of the system to ensure that only relevant data are collected
and that the data are analysed and used by them. System design therefore is simple, flexible and
transparent, and would focus mainly on four result areas: (a) empowerment, mobilization and the capacities
of the rural poor; (b) CIGs' access to productive assets, infrastructure and services; (c) administrative and
local governments' capacities to meet the development needs of the poor; and (d) changes in vulnerability
and poverty.
Description of the M&L system
DPIP would not set targets for activities or for numbers of beneficiaries. Hence these would not be
the basis for monitoring its progress. Instead, it would focus on project outcomes and results as perceived
by the target communities, including their perceptions of self-development. The M&L system would
monitor the project's progress in terms of:
*   Inputs delivered: timeliness, effectiveness and efficiency;
-   Delivery system responsiveness to beneficiary needs;
*   Information used for project learning;
*   Beneficiaries empowerment and capacity development.
Given the objectives and expected results of the the project, a four-component M&L system is
envisaged. These components are:
*   Performance tracking;
3   Process monitoring;
*   Development audit;
*   Impact evaluation
Performance tracking would monitor progress in the recruitment and training of staff, formation of groups,
sub-projects initiated and completed. financial flows, and benefits accrued. This component would be
linked to the information and technology of the financial management system required by the World Bank.
Process nmonitoring would focus on the critical aspects of project learning such as CIG's skills in group
activities, decision-making, and important events in CIG's life. Examples of information generated at
different levels are given in the next section
Development audit would contribute to increasing transparency, accountability and efficiency of the
project. It is a tool to assess the effects of the project from the perspective of different stakeholders.
Impact evaluation would establish the net effects of the project on poverty reduction and the capacities of
the poor. It would assess the changes in poverty levels, changes in capacities to utilize resources and
exploit opportunities; and changes in poverty-causing factors such as debt, ill-health and addictions. These
results would be relevant for subsequent phases of DPIP, and for designing other similar projects.
-60 -



M&L components and indicators
Component 1: Performance Tracking
Performance tracking would use mainly quantitative indicators to assess progress in the physical,
financial, and capacity development aspects of the project. These indicators would include, for example,
CFs and other project staff appointed and trained, number of CIGs formed, participation of the poor and
vulnerable groups in the CIGs, number of sub-projects approved and completed, utilization of funds,
benefits accrued, etc. It would also track some of the quality aspects of the project such as delays in
appraisal and approval of sub-projects; time and cost over-runs; CIGs becoming dysfunctional, and
changes changes in perceptions of poverty and vulnerability in the project villages. Using these indicators
project implementors would assess whether project inputs are being used efficiently, reaching the intended
target groups, and helping the CIGs' to develop their capacities.
Component 2: Process Monitoring
Process monitoring would be undertaken to help those involved in the project to understand how
inputs get converted into outputs, what issues are critical in that conversion process, and what action is
necessary to increase effectiveness. This component would monitor issues such as project staff sensitivities
to the needs of the poor; intimidation or capturing of benefits by elite groups; internal and external
functioning of CIGs and VDAs. Another purpose of process monitoring would be to identify good
practices to emulate elsewhere in the project.
Process monitoring is especially important in DPIP because the project does not have
predetermined targets. It does however assume that certain procedures would take place, which would help
to achieve project goals. The project's success hinges on how well these assumptions hold. Key
process-related assumptions are:
o   The target communities have information about and access to investment funds.
-   GIGs would effectively and inclusively manage group dynamics and operations.
O   PRIs and district administrations do not feel alienated by CIG initiatives.
-   DPMUs would respond quickly and objectively to sub-project proposals.
-   Service and other input providers would respond adequately to CIG needs.
If these assumptions did not hold well, DPIP would not achieve its intended outcomes.
Performance tracking could highlight process issues but would not provide adequate explanations or
identify mediating factors that affect performance. Such realities are best assessed through a combination
of conventional and participatory techniques and learning strategies. Process monitoring would therefore
consist of three approaches to data collection and use:
Group self-assessment in which CIGs and VDAs would use learning tools to assess their own
organizational and capacity development. Each CIG or VDA would periodically undertake an
self-assessment of the goals it set for itself and measure progress using indicators it selects.
Self-assessments would track levels of satisfaction/dissatisfaction of the groups, CIGs' capacities to
manage local activities, to solve problems, to mobilize resources and take responsibility. In order for the
group self-assessments to be useful and taken seriously by CIG members, the CIGs must be empowered to
take decisions on the basis of their collective analysis. They may also need to be effectively linked to a
hiigher-level decision-making body that would respond quickly and effectively when required.
Peer Reviews would be used for cross-group learning. These would involve experience-sharing
and learning from groups with similar interests, e.g., CIGs formed around the same activity, VDAs
addressing similar issues, DPMUs managing particular project components. Peer reviews would focus on
a limited number of activities or topics. Because the emphasis is on constructive lessons, topics would
- 61 -



normally be those with which at least one group is having positive experiences. It is anticipated that the
outcomes of these reviews would feed back into the overall project monitoring data/information base in a
small report form.
Focused-studies would be needed from time to time to understand certain process issues in a more
rigorous and systematic way. Methodologies for these studies could range from rapid assessments to more
conventional analytical approaches. Identification of the issues or the trigger for such studies would come
from a variety of sources. Some would emerge from the tracking and monitoring components; others
would emerge in response to changes in the project's macro-environment. Any group of stakeholders
would be able to put forth requests for a focused-study to the concerned DPMU or the SPMU. It is
anticipated that about 20-25 such studies would be carried out during the life of the project. Each report
would be made publicly available, and an executive summary circulated and kept at all DPMUs and the
SPMU.
Component 3: Development Audit
In many respects development audit is very similar to process monitoring but it differs in three
important ways. First, it can be undertaken by an independent agency, giving an opportunity to project
implementors to stand back and review the project from different perspectives - those of non-beneficiaries,
of opinion leaders, and other stakeholders. Second, it can take place less frequently than other process
monitoring activities say, once in two years. Third, it would draw information from a wide range of
stakeholders, including those not directly involved in the project. Development audit would be a powerful
tool to demonstrate public value and accountability of the project. Experimentation in Rajasthan would
build on other experiences of social audit in the state, efforts of other organizations to promote public
accountability, and an experiment scheduled as a part of the Madhya Pradesh DPIP.
Development audit is currently conceived as a series of steps that would culminate in a scored
assessment of project effectiveness in the broader social, economic and political context of DPIP.
Development audit activities would begin in Rajasthan in the second year of the project. At present it is
anticipated that development audit would assist those involved in the project to:
_ Verify sub-project activities, their costs and timeliness;
a Assess whether project benefits have reached poor and vulnerable groups;
= Assess whether CIGs and VDAs are empowering the poor and vulnerable;
* Analyse whether the selection of sub-projects, use of project resources, and decision-making in
the project are transparent and inclusive;
*   Access whether different stakeholders have understood and accepted the project's objectives
and strategy.
Component 4: Impact Evaluation
The central objective of the impact evaluation would be to establish the net contribution of the
project to poverty reduction and capacity building among the poor. Measuring impact would involve
comparing qualitative and quantitative outcomes "before" and "after" the project, and between the "project"
and "control" areas. Since these outcomes depend on a number of factors, many related but some unrelated
to the project, an effective impact evaluation would try to estimate the net effect after controlling for the
non-project factors to the extent possible. It is accepted that attribution of causality would be difficult.
This would involve not only acknowledgment of possibly unacceptable assumptions, but also a rigorous
methodology and level of analysis which is unlikely to be cost-effective for DPIP. However, the simple
quantitative and qualitative exercises using comparative analysis in project and control areas could provide
extremely useful feedback on project impact.
The changes in poverty and poverty-causing factors would be assessed through indicators such as
-62 -



the increase in earnings of the target groups, in land yields, in access to water, health and education
facilities, and in skills and organizing capacity. The project impact would also be measured in terms of
inicreased and strengthened social capital of vulnerable groups in the project villages. The indicators of
social capital include strength of formal and informal village networks, capacity of members to form new
groups, members' knowledge and participation in existing government programs, and the responsiveness of
PRIs and government administration to the needs of the poor.
Recognizing that this project expects different outcomes at the village, household and sub-project
levels, different sets of indicators have been proposed at each level. Baseline information on these
outcomes would be collected mainly through household surveys, supplemented by other data sources such
as census and village records, and using other data-gathering techniques such as social mapping and
participatory learning techniques. An external agency would be appointed to undertake the baseline survey
in a sample of project and control villages before project start-up; and the endline survey would similarly
be conitracted out to an independent agency.

Gender Strategy
The Situation of Women in Rajasthan
Rajasthan is acknowledged as a state where women's status is particularly low. It has a feudal
culture and patriarchy is institutionalized. Power and land ownership have remained largely vested in men,
and patriarchy has also been enforced through institutions such as purdah (seclusion of women),child
marriages, female infanticide, and sati. (widow immolation). An alarming trend is the steep decline in the
ratio of women to men in the state. In 1981, the sex ratio was 919 females to males, and in 1991 this
figure was 913 females per 1000 males (compared with the all-India average of 932). The sex ratios in the
DPIP districts have decreased, with Churu showing a large decline from 954 in 1981 to 937 in 1991, and
Jhalawar reaching the lowest level of 918 in 1991 from 926 in 1981. Educational attainment among
women in Rajasthani is extremely low -- only 20.44 percent are literate, one of the lowest literacy rates in
the country. The literacy levels for rural women in all the DPIP districts is low, ranging from 9.29 percent
In Jhalawar to 14.19 percent in the best district. These data indicate extreme exploitation and
subordination of women.
Since the 1970s the Government of Rajasthan has initiated a number of programs for women's
development including programs for women's health, education, employment and empowerment. The
Women's Development Program was the first program in the state to make a conscious effort to empower
women through communication, information, education and awareness. Recognition of the need to increase
the space for women in the public sphere also prompted legislation to give women 33 percent reservation in
the Panchayati Raj institutions all over India, including Rajasthan.
The importance of women's participation in PRIs has to be understood in the context of their social
subordination. While it is true that the traditional social and political structures continue to subordinate
women even after they are elected, the opportunity to participate in public space is itself a great leap
forward for women in Rajasthan. There are over 2000 women members of PRIs altogether in the seven
DPIP districts. Women panchayat members would remain limited in their capacity to make or enforce
decisions until they become informed and aware, and can function confidently in a traditionally male
domain.
DPIP's Approach to Gender Equity
In Rajasthan, it is vitally important for women to have greater control over decisions regarding
expenditure, marriage and reproduction; opportunities to be effective in diverse roles, especially in
PRIs, and recognition of their rights to dignity and security. In this context, the approach of DPIP to
meet the economic needs of the poor within the strategic focus of capacity-building is appropriate and
conducive to addressing the needs of women. Three elements are essential for successful gender
intervention in DPIP:
* Environment-building to prepare the ground for gender action at both village and district
levels. Community Facilitators would involve existing women's groups to create
awareness and information about DPIP, to address the needs of women. The message of
women's empowerment through poverty reduction and capacity building would be spread
through village-level meetings, workshops, fairs, etc.
*   Capacity-building, consisting of gender sensitization of male and female staff; the use of
knowledge and tools to promote women's development and empowerment; and the
- 65 -



promotion of learning for self-development among women in the target communities.
*   Women' s Resource Centers to provide human and material support to women in the
project areas, and over time in other parts of the state, to ensure gender equity. The WRCs
would support DPIP through training, research, documentation, and information
dissemination, to strengthen the delivery mechanisms for women, and enable them to
become active partners in the development process. A State Women's Resource Center
(SWRC) would be responsible for promoting and incorporating a gender perspective into
all DPIP activities. It would be an autonomous unit, with an overall Coordinator and three
specialist coordinators for training, documentation and information dissemination, and
research. Autonomy would ensure the focus, flexibility and sensitivity to women issues.
The District Women's Resource Centers (DWRC) would be created by the SWRC in all
seven project districts to ensure attention to gender in the day-to-day implementation of the
project.
Gender in Project Implementation
Community Investment Funds
DPIP's design to support small, community-based initiatives is particularly appropriate to meet
women's needs. CFs would be trained to work with women to articulate their needs and priorities, a
number of which were identified during the social assessments, including drinking water,
income-generation, health, literacy, day care, and micro-enterprises. The following issues would be
part of the discussion in each CIG or VDA prior to the proposal of an activity as a sub-project.
*   Are women's needs and potential being addressed through the proposed intervention?
* What benefits would flow to women from the intervention?
* What resources are being made available through the intervention? Would women have
access to them, and be likely to manage and control them?
*   Are there likely burdens on women? If so, are they being compensated adequately and/or
mitigation measures worked out?
Gender Appraisal of Sub-Projects. These questions would underlie the criteria for gender
appraisal that would be part of the social appraisal format for sub-projects, to ensure that gender is
considered in determining the viability of a sub-project and that women are part of the process of
determining trade-offs and the selection of mitigation measures. Close monitoring of activities would
also be undertaken to identify requirements that were not apparent during sub-project appraisal.
Capacity-building
The gender-related capacity-building strategy is detailed in the State Project Implementation
Plan. Some elements of the plan would serve as budget heads for the separate allocations of project
funds to women's development. At least 40 percent of the funds for capacity-building under DPIP
would be allocated for women's development, and expenditures monitored separately.
Project Management
At least 30 percent of the members of the DPIP Governing Council would be women
(government representatives and non-officials, counted separately). Women non-officials would be
representatives of genuinely progressive women's empowerment efforts in the state, with demonstrated
capacity for women's advocacy. In addition, a Gender Advisory Committee would be set up at the state
level to guide, monitor and evaluate the implementation of gender aspects in DPIP. Regular quarterly
meetings of the members of the committee would be held to ensure support to project activities. The
committee would give feedback to the SPMU and suggest actions on various issues emerging from the
- 66 -



field. The decisions of the Advisory Committee would be taken cognizance of during implementation.
Linkages with Other Government Programs. Trained human resources exist in other state
programs, such as WDP, Lok Jumbish, and Shiksha Karmi, that could be effectively used for
environment-building and capacity-building in DPIP. DPIP would also extend to these workers the
networks that are created for women staff at the grassroots level.
Monitoring and Learning. The M&L system would monitor the progress and evaluate the
impact of the project on women. The participatory nature of the M&L would ensure that appropriate
indicators for impact, performance and process monitoring are developed in consultation with women in
the target communities and staff, although some have already been identified. Among the broad areas
to be tracked by performance monitoring are: the number of women's groups formed, the number of
women in mixed CIGs, activities being selected and managed by women, and the benefits they are
receiving. The process monitoring would, among other things, assess the following: development and
consolidation of women CIGs; women's role in mixed CIGs; the effect of organizational development
on their capacities to make decisions within groups as well as in the household and community. It
would also assess the role of capacity-building, women's networks and the other initiatives to bring
women together. It would monitor the role of the women's resource centers. Women in CIGs would be
involved in assessing their empowerment through self-assessments. The process of recording, analysing
and reporting are empowering mechanisms in themselves. The tools for group self-assessment that are
part of the M&L are intended to help beneficiaries track their own progress. Women's culture, literacy
levels, and other aspects would be taken into account in their design. For example, for illiterate women
the self-assessment tools would be largely visual. The impact assessment would monitor, inter alia, the
impact of DPIP on: women's incomes and livelihoods; linkages with markets; access to technology;
skills; new designs for crafts; understanding of gender issues among staff; and gender sensitivity in line
departments at various levels, and within NGOs.

Annex 2
Attachment 10
Tribal Development Plan*
A Tribal Development Plan has been prepared for the project and has been attached to the Minutes
of Negotiations. A brief overview. is provided here.
Background
Rajasthan has a tribal population of 5.47 million people, amounting to 12.44 percent of its total
population. Table I provides information on the percentage of tribal people in the project districts and
blocks, and the year-wise phasing of coverage of the blocks. Twenty-four of the 42 project blocks have
tribal populations over 10 percent, while 18 are under this level. In general, the project would begin
implementation in the most difficult tribal blocks in each district, and cover additional blocks in subsequent
years. All project blocks would be covered during the project period, and it is proposed that all tribal
villages would participate in the project. In order to ensure that the impact of the project on tribal people
is measurable, and to provide specific, reliable and up-to-date information on them, a Baseline Survey
would be carried out in all project districts once the Project becomes effective. This would include the
tribal blocks and an appropriate sample of tribal villages and people.
The principal tribal groups are the Bhils, Sehariyas and Meenas. Poor tribals are largely
agricultural laborers and cultivators, and are involved in forest-related occupations. Only a very small
proportion of them are engaged in other occupations of the district such as mining, quarrying, construction
or services. They are generally found to be poorer than non-tribal groups. Their search for livelihoods has
pushed them out of main villages to the edges of settlements. The inaccessibility of tribal hamlets denies
them even the rudimentary infrastructure and services that exist in non-tribal areas. The Scheduled Tribes
have lower literacy levels than non-tribal people. According to the 1991 Census, the average literacy rate
was 38.55 percent for the whole state, but it was only 19.44 for the STs. While the female literacy rate for
the state was, 20.44 percent, for ST females it was only 4.42 percent.
Project Approach
Because the needs of tribal people are manifold and the result of problems that have evolved over
time, improvements in their condition would need integrated interventions and sustained efforts over a long
period. The precise nature of interventions and the additional activities needed to rout specific or
deeply-entrenched problems would be determined when their needs are articulated during the social
mobilization phase of the DPIP project cycle, and expressed as demands through the sub-projects proposed
by Common Interest Groups. In addition to meeting immediate needs, the entitlements of STs to common
property lands and forests would be addressed together in DPIP, i.e., the overall implementation strategy
would be to improve STs incomes in the short-term through economic solutions, such as inputs and training
to increase productivity, or micro-enterprise development, and enhance their sustainable development by
helping the tribal people address the underlying causes of their problems, to identify and take actions
necessary to remedy their situations, ensuring their entitlements and that they gain control of their economic
lives.
NGOs already working with tribal people would be involved in the project and assisted to enlarge
their ambit, to undertake community organization work and/or provide other project-related services.

Where necessary, capacity would be built by the project to encourage and equip NGOs to work
witlh tribal people, and they would be provided adequate resources for field operations in these, often
difficult, areas. The project would ensure high levels of effort in preparing viable sub-project proposals for
the tribal groups and villages, and make investment funds readily available through the CIFs. The DPMUs
would be the main project agencies responsible for ensuring adequate attention to tribal areas. They would
liaise with and mobilize, as required, other government agencies in the districts to provide support,
including officers and line department staff working in/near the tribal areas. Where necessary, the
capacities of these staff to work in tribal areas (physical capacity, sensitivity, motivation, skills) would also
be enhanced through the project. This would, in turn, strengthen existing programs. The State Project
Management Unit would be responsible for overall project planning and supervision, including ensuring
that monitoring data are collected and utilized to keep project implementation on track to meet its
development objectives in tribal areas.

INDIA: RAJASTHAN DISTRICT POVERTY INITIATIVES PROJECT
Economic Assessment
Introduction
The project would invest in increasing the knowledge and organization of poor people, and their
access to public infrastructure, services and markets, covering at least 350,000 families in seven of the
poorest districts of Rajasthan. This investment would significantly increase their levels of economic
activity, productivity and income. Knowledge and organization of poor people, and their access to public
infrastructure, services and markets, commonly called "intangible assets", are crucial to enhance of the
economic productivity of individuals as well as enterprises. However, while their importance is well
recognized, the quantification of these assets is often difficult; and it is even more difficult to give them an
economic value. Given these problems, the following economic assessment does not compute an overall
economic rate of return (IRR) for the project, but demonstrates: (a) the likelihood that the project would
pass the overall benchmark of capital investment with an IRR of more than 12 percent; and (b) that
individual activities likely to be taken up under the project would be economically viable.
Capacity Building and the Community Investment Funds
Final benefits from the capacity building component of the project, in terms of improved incomes
and living conditions of the poor, arise through several intermediate stages. Chart 1 provides an
illustration of the economic input/output flows for selected project activities. The exact type and
composition of outputs cannot be anticipated at this stage. Uncertainty about the outcome of the capacity
building component enters into the CIF component since sub-projects proposed for financing under the
CIFs are expected to arise as a result of capacity-building in the form of CIG development and
CIG-supporting activities. Most of the CIF investments are expected to serve as 'enabling' investments,
which would improve the conditions of the poor and would stimulate in a second and third stage the
beneficiaries' own economic activities and productivity.
Despite these difficulties an investment decision would be supported by an economic analysis
through:
A comparative analysis: Under otherwise comparable conditions, the economic productivity of
people organized into groups would be compared with those not organized. All intermediate inputs and
outputs could be seen as a 'black box'. It would not be necessary to quantify them since the incremental
benefit of the project would be measured by assessing the economic net value of production of groups,
comparing them with the economic net value of production of a similar number of people not organized in
groups; or
A least return analysis: This analysis would ask by how much the productivity of people would
need to be raised to make the investment viable (break even point) *. Reference would be made to the total
project investment per individual or per CIG and the incremental economic net return, which would be
necessary over a certain period of time to generate an IRR above 12 percent.
No cornprehensive assessment of economic activities of CIGs has yet been undertaken in the
project areas and therefore no data are available for a comparative analysis. Given the limitation of
quantitative information the "least return analysis" was used as a rapid assessment method. This analysis
is supported by cost-benefit analyses of a limited number of typical small sub-projects, which indicate the
considerable scope of viable investment opportunities under the CIF (see Table 1). Further example
analyses would be made available in the guidelines for sub-project appraisal prepared for the project.
- 74 -



Economic assessment results: It is estimated that about 350,000 families would directly benefit
from membership in one or more CIGs supported by the project. Total project investment for CIGs is
estimated at about US$65.9 rnillion ** or about US$188 per family. Assuming that benefits would start 2
to 3 years after group formation, an average annual raise in the economic net productivity per family of
US$25.3 would break even with an IRR of 12 percent. An average raise in family productivity of about
two dollars per month (equivalent to less than Rs. 100 per month) is a very modest assumption and it is
expected that the impact of the project would be higher ***.
Samples. of activities stipulated by the project show estimated economic IRRs in a range from 14
percent (village access road construction) to 48 percent (training of para-veterinary workers, see Table 1
B 1). These examples demonstrate a good potential for economnically-viable activities. Assessment of the
economic benefits of individual investment proposals under the CIF would be an on-going process as part
of the sub-project appraisal mechanism. This would ensure that the overall project would be economically
viable as well.
* This question could be answered in absolute terms, i.e., an assessment of existing productivity levels would be unnecessary.
** The total econonmic investment costs ofthe projectare estimated at US$124.7 nillion, of which US$58.8 million (60% ofthe CIF) are
expected to be invested in larger rural Infrastructure activities and would generate benefits beyond the directly-supported groups. The
remaining US$65.9 million are considered as direct and indirect investment in CIGs through Capacity Building, CIF and Project
Management costs.
*** It needs to be kept in mind that an increase in net productivity does not only include direct increases in on- and off-farm income or
farm and labor productivity. It also includes, for example, improved health and fewer days spent unproductively due to sickness or caring
for sick people; labor-saved fetching water; increases in adult and child literacy rates; lower social costs due to population control; etc.

Main assumptions:
The total project cost is estimated as US$124.79 (Rs 6.25 billion equivalent). A summary of detailed
project costs is shown in Annex 3. The estimate is based on detailed costing of the project management
and capacity building components. As investments under the Community Investment Fund cornponent
would be in response to demand from local groups supported by the project, the details of which are not
known in advance, the cost estimate for the CIF was derived on the basis of activities identified during the
social assessments conducted in the seven project districts, estimated demand for such activities, and
available unit costs of typical sub-projects.
Contingencies: The total project cost includes physical contingencies of 10 percent for goods and
equipment. Price contingencies for foreign currency have been calculated based on projected MUV-5 price
escalation factors of 2.5 percent for the years 2000 and 2001, 2.6 percent for the year 2002, and 2.5
percent for each year thereafter. For costs in local currency, an annual price escalation of 6.0 percent has
been used for the project period.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
INDIA: RAJASTHAN DISTRICT POVERTY INITIATIVES PROJECT
Procurement
Procurement in the project would be carried out under the overall supervision and guidance of the
State Project Management Unit (SPMU). Its actual management will be at the district level. The project
design is based on the concept of bottom-up planning, and most of the activities under the project would be
decided by individual village communities.
Community Investments (US$ 102.56 million) : The project would finance small sub-projects
proposed by Common Interest Groups, such as village approach or link roads, community halls, watershed
development, strengthening of health care centers, improving animal health care and breed upgradation
facilities, drains, minor irrigation works, wells, drinking water arrangements, etc. The sub-projects would
also include the hiring of services or training of conmmunity members, wherever these would be managed by
the conmmunities themselves. NGOs' assistance would be taken for preparation of sub-projects.
Procurement would follow National Competitive Bidding (NCB) or direct contracting, quotation or
community participation procedures following Bank Procurement Guidelines (January 1995, Revised
January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999) as follows:
NCB: While it is unlikely that individual contracts to be financed under the CIF would cost more
than US$30,000 equivalent, contracts for works under the CIF costing US$30,000 or more per
contract would be awarded on the basis of NCB procedures acceptable to IDA.
Direct Contracting/Shopping/Community Participation: Procurement of works under the CIF
estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$30,000 per contract would be done through: (a)
direct contracting with registered NGOs or local community organizations such as Common
Interest Groups; (b) lump-sum fixed-price/unit rate contracts with qualified contractors awarded on
the basis of quotations obtained from at least 3 qualified domestic contractors in response to a
written invitation; or (c) community participation. These works would not be suitable for
competitive bidding due to the small amounts entailed, their scattered nature, and the remoteness of
potential locations.
Goods, Equipment, Furniture and Supplies (US$ 2.8 million): Goods would be procured
following Bank Procurement Guidelines (January 1995, Revised January and August 1996, September
1997 and January 1999) as follows:
NCB: Goods estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$200,000 per contract (e.g., furniture,
computers and peripherals, office equipment, training equipment etc.) up to an aggregate value of
US$ 0.6 million would be procured following NCB procedures acceptable to IDA.
National Shopping: Goods (except vehicles) estimated to cost less than US$ 30,000 per contract
(e.g., small items of equipment, urgent requirements of computers, audio-visual equipment,
furniture, etc.) would be procured by the various implementing agencies in small lots using
National Shopping procedures in accordance with paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines, up to
an aggregate amount of US$ 1.5 million. Rate contracts of the Directorate General of Supplies
and Disposals (DGS&D) would be acceptable as a substitute for National Shopping.
- 80 -



Direct Contracting: Goods estimated to cost less than US$ 10,000 equivalent per contract upto an
aggregate of US$0.7 million (e.g., books, periodicals, extension and publicity materials, software,
proprietary equipment and spares, etc.) would be procured using direct contracting procedures in
accordance with paragraph 3.7 of the Guidelines. Petty items costing US$500 equivalent or less
subject to an aggregate amount of US$ 100,000 would be procured following paragraph 3.7 of
Guidelines.
Vehicles (US$0.015 million): The requirement of vehicles (motorcycles) is small and thus would
not be amenable to central and lumped procurement. These would be procured using the National
Shopping procedure or DGS&D rate contracts.
Training and Consultancies (US$ 16.8 million): Technical assistance and consultancy services,
including the hiring of NGO services, Community Facilitators, quality supervisors for community works,
consultancies and studies would be contracted on Terms and Conditions which are in accordance with IDA
Guidelines for the use of Consultants (January 1997 and revised in September 1997 and January 1999).
Technical Assistance and consultancy services would be procured using QCBS procedures. For contracts
with consulting firms/institutions valued below US$100,000 equivalent per contract, procurement would
follow QCBS or other methods mentioned in the Guidelines, depending upon the appropriateness of the
procedures relevant to the requirements. For individual consultants, this threshold would be US$50,000
equivalent per contract. The Standard Request for Proposals and Conditions of Contract would be used for
all contracts.
Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions: (Table B)
Procurement Planning
Prior to the issuance of any invitations to pre-qualify for bidding or to bid for contracts, the
proposed procurement plan for the project shall be furnished to the Bank for its review and approval, in

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
When the existing disbursement procedures are used, disbursements would be made against
Withdrawal Applications for: (a) direct payments; (b) reimbursement of expenditures with full
documentation; and (c) reimbursement of expenditures against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). IDA
would disburse against SOEs for the following expenditures: (a) Community Investment Fund sub-projects
not exceeding US$100,000 equivalent; (b) contracts for goods and equipment not exceeding US$100,000
equivalent; (c) contracts for consultants services not exceeding US$ 100,000 in the case of consulting firms,
and not exceeding US$50,000 in the case of individual consultants; (d) training expenditure; and (e)
incremental operating costs.
Special account:
A Special Account would be maintained in the Reserve Bank of India; and would be operated by
the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) of Government of India (GOI). The Special Account would be
operated in accordance with the Bank's operational policies:
(a) When existing disbursement procedures are used, the authorized allocation of the Special
Account would be US$7.0 rnillion which represents about 4 months of estimated disbursements
from the IDA Credit. The authorized allocation would be US$3.5 million until the aggregate
disbursements from the IDA Credit reach the equivalent of SDR 10.5 million. The Special
Account would be replenished monthly or when 20 percent of the advance to the Special Account
has been utilized, whichever occurs first.
(b) When disbursements are based on PMRs, the authorized allocation of the Special Account
would be US$15.0 million. This represents 6 months of peak expenditure. The Special Account
would be replenished quarterly and be based on the next 6 months funds forecast.
The disbursement would initially be made according to the traditional method (reimbursement with
full documentation and against statements of expenditure and would be converted to PMR-based
disbursement after the financial management system has been demonstrated to be operating satisfactorily.
The target date for this conversion is July 1, 2001.

Financial Management
Current Financial Management System
The executing agency for the project is the Department of Rural Development, Government of
Rajasthan. The department follows the government accounting system, the main focus of which is on
book-keeping and transactional control over expenditures. There is no concept of financial management
information being used for decision-making, and hence there is very limited focus on meeting project
management information needs. Project financial staternents indicating sources and uses of funds
(including information on project expenditures by components, types of expenditure, etc.) are not prepared
for the projects executed by the Department. There is no effective funds management in place in the
absence of a regular system of forecasting of expenditure and monitoring. Audit of expenditure statements
carried out by the State Accountant General (Audit) focuses only on authentication of individual
transactions, verification of compliance with Govermnent procedures, and certification of reimbursement
claims made to the Bank. The financial system is operated manually.
Specific areas to be strengthened. The following aspects of the current financial management
system would be addressed to ensure that a satisfactory financial management system, commensurate with
the size and scope of the project, is established:
Satisfactory staffing and training. Financial functions would be staffed by suitably qualified
accounts professionals. The entire financial staff would be trained in the operation of the computerized
FMS. Project managers and financial staff would be sensitized to the importance of financial management
for effective project management. Since a significant part of the accounting under the project is to be done
at the village level, it would be very imnportant to impart basic accounting training to the village
accountants.
Analysis offinancial information and its use as a decision-making tool. Financial reports which
provide timely, relevant and accurate information on the financial performance of the project would be
prepared. The accounting system would ensure classification and compilation/analysis of accounting data
in a manner that provides useful and timely information for project monitoring and decision-making.
Transparency ofproject operations and establishment of clearfinancial policies and procedures.
All stakeholders would be provided with clear, simple, user-friendly, and consistent financial information
about the project's performance and fnancial status.
Satisfactory audit arrangement. including timely submission of audit reports and certification of
project fmancial statements adopting acceptable auditing standards would be ensured.
Linking ofphysical progress withfinancial progress would be done.
A simple and effective monitoring mechanismwould be introduced to ensure effective monitoring
of a large number of widely dispersed entities.
A smooth fundsflow system would be adopted for the project to ensure smooth flows of funds to
Common Interest Groups (CIGs) at the operating level, as these groups may be highly vulnerable to
periodic funds shortages. The system of funds flow management would also ensure that control over the
money actually passes to the CIGs, but that the necessary controls are built in to check misappropriation.
The SPMU is developing a comprehensive computerized financial management system which
would address these issues.
Proposed Financial Management System
The proposed project financial management system has been documented in a 'Financial
- 86 -



Management Manual'. This Manual would be a part of the Borrower's Project Implementation Plan on
financial management. The Financial Management Manual would also serve as a reference document for
all project staff. The Financial Management Manual would be periodically updated based on
implementation experience. The significant changes in the Manual would be made in consultation with the
Bank. The Manual includes the following aspects of financial management:
* budgeting and flow of funds;
* accounting system (including Chart of Accounts, formats of books, accounting and financial
procedures;
* financial reporting (including formats of reports, and linkages with Chart of Accounts);
staffing and training aspects;
* auditing arrangements including Terms of Reference;
* procurement and contract administration monitoring system;
*   financial and accounting policies; and
*   service standards (benchmarks) for various accounting and financial activities.
Budgeting and Flow of Funds
The funds-flow process is summarized below:
* The Government of India (GOI) would pass funds on to the Government of Rajasthan (GOR)
in accordance with the prevailing system of Centre to State fund transfers applied to
Bank-assisted state-sector projects.
-  The state government would pass on the funds to an interest-bearing Public Deposit (PD)
account established for the project at the state level (SPMU), and from there the funds would
be passed on to the project bank accounts in the districts, based on the cash flow forecasts of
the districts. Transfers from the State Government to the SPMU PD account, and from the
SPMU PD account to the DPMUs' bank accounts would be on a quarterly basis. The DPMUs
would retain funds for their own expenditures, and advance funds for approved sub-projects to
CIGs.
Flow of Funds to CIGs. The process of funds flow to the CIGs would be as follows:
- On receipt of a proposal for a sub-project from a CIG, the proposal would be technically and
financially appraised.
- The proposal would be processed within 15 days and if it is approved, a Sub-Project
Agreement would be signed between the DPMU and the CIG for a 'fixed-price contract' for
the sub-project. The Agreement would inter alia specify: (a) the total cost of the work; (b)
work completion milestones; (c) payment terms; (d) beneficiary contributions (in cash, labor
and/or material); and (e) the scheduling of beneficiary contributions.
The release of installments would be worked out to ensure that the processing time taken at the
DPMU does not adversely affect the execution of the sub-project by the CIG. The schedule of payment
would be as follows:
*  On signing the Agreement and fulfillment of initial actions (including any beneficiary
contributions to be collected): 10 percent plus the amount agreed for the first milestone;
* On completion of the first milestone: amount due to reach the second milestone;
* On completion of second milestone: amount due to reach the third milestone minus 10 percent.
Thus, a buffer of 10 percent of the total cost of the sub-project would be with CIG to tide-over any
delays in processing at the DPMU.

*   The basis for the release of all subsequent installments would be completion certifications for
the previous milestones. CIGs would provide completion certifications for each milestone
(checked and certified by appropriate persons appointed by the DPMU for this purpose), along
with a request for the next installment.
*   Cash contributions from beneficiaries, if envisaged in the sub-project Agreement, would be
deposited up front into the Project Bank Accounts of the CIGs, and would be a pre-condition
for release of the first installment. The beneficiary contributions would be accounted for as
sources of funds for the respective sub-project.
* Service standards (benchmarks) have been developed to specifically monitor the turn-around
time for funds transfer from DPMUs to CIGs. Regular feedback would be obtained from
CIGs on whether there are any difficulties in releases of funds.
Accounting and Internal Controls
The overall framework for the system is given below:
* The financial management system would cover all project-related transactions, i.e., all sources
of funds (GOR, beneficiaries, and Bank) would be accounted for and reflected in the project
financial statements; and, similarly, all project expenditures would be reflected in the project
financial statements.
3  A Chart of Accounts has been developed. The Chart of Accounts enables expenditure data to
be captured and classified by project components and expenditure categories. The Chart of
Accounts also has linkages to: (a) government budget heads/categories; and (b) disbursement
categories. Similarly, the Chart of Accounts enables data on sources of funds to be captured.
 The financial management system is being computerized. The computerized system would be
installed and operated at the SPMU and the seven DPMUs. Accounts of the SPMU and the
seven DPMUs would be consolidated for project financial reports. Data transfer for the
various consolidations would be done periodically through electronic mail or storage media
(diskettes/compact disks).
*  Books of accounts for the project would be maintained using double-entry bookkeeping
principles. Standard books/records of accounts (cash and bank-books, journals, ledgers, trial
balance, etc.) would be maintained at the SPMU and DPMUs using an integrated
computerized accounting system. A register of fixed assets, indicating assets created through
the project or acquired under the project, would also be maintained using the computerized
system.
Accounting for Sub-Projects Implemented by CIGs. The release of funds to CIGs for
sub-projects would be based on the terms agreed to in the Agreement between the DPMU and the CIG.
The disbursements would be based on these releases to CIGs. However, in the DPMU books of accounts,
advances to CIGs would be treated as advances, and expenditures would be booked against these advances
only when physical milestones are reported to have been completed by the CIGs. The DPMUs would also
maintain records of assets created.
Beneflciary Contributions. Cash contributions from beneficiaries would be accounted on the
basis of actual amounts deposited by beneficiaries into their 'Project Bank Account'. Beneficiary
contributions of labor and materials would be accounted based on the terms of beneficiary contribution as
defined in the Agreement and as captured in the achievement of the physical benchmarks.
Accounting at CIGs. In accordance with the Sub-Project Agreement, the communities would
maintain (for their own purposes and to ensure transparency) accounts of amounts spent and contributions
received. Formats of simple accounting records to be maintained by the communities are being developed,
- 88 -



and village-level bookkeepers would be engaged by the communities and trained in this system. Eligibility
criteria for sub-projects and advances to communities would include ensuring satisfactory arrangements for
accounting, and submnission of simple summary account statements.
Each CIG would maintain the following books (for which formats are being developed):
* Simple cash/bank book providing details of amounts received into the project bank account and
details of payments;
* Register of contributions received from members in cash, labor and materials;
* Register of materials purchased using project funds, materials contributed and materials
utilized.
Transaction information flow. The SPMU and DPMUs would generate and maintain the
transaction vouchers for the various receipts and expenditures made at SPMU and DPMU levels,
respectively. The CIGs would also maintain vouchers/bills/supporting documents for the various payments
(systematically numbered), and copies of the Bank account statement (pass book).
The CIGs would prepare a simple report each month and submit it to DPMU. This would indicate:
* the cash amount received from state and beneficiary contributions, amounts spent on various
items, and balance in the bank account or cash book (the format of the cash/bank book would
facilitate easy preparation of this summary);
* the details of the work being carried out (activity to be completed, cost), the work completed,
and the work to be done in the next month;
* the CIGs contribution in labor and materials.
The CIG would present this report to the members and to the Gram Sabha. This report would be
displayed on the notice board of the Gram Sabha or village hall, etc. All the reports of the various CIGs
operating in the village would be so displayed. In addition, the books/registers, vouchers and bank
statements would be brought to the meetings of the CIGs and Gram Sabha, and be open for scrutiny by
members.
Accounting at the DPMU would not be based on this statement (except for beneficiary cash
contributions). The DPMUs would monitor the regularity of submission of these reports. Up-to-date
submission of these monthly reports would be required before release of subsequent installments. This
report would not be used at the district either for accounting or for determining the amount of money to be
released to the CIGs. Its main objective would be to inculcate a sense of responsibility in the CIGs for
regular updating of accounts.
Consolidation of project accounts would be done first at the district level by consolidation of data
of all the CIGs and the DPMU, and then at the SPMU by consolidation of accounts of the SPMU and all
the DPMUs using the computerized system. Data transfer would be handled through: (a) an integrated
computer network, or (b) a periodic data transfer through Electronic Mail or floppy diskettes.
Internal ControL Internal control mechanisms for the project would include the following:
* establishment of appropriate budgeting systems, and regular monitoring of actual financial
performance with budgets and targets, monitoring of physical and financial progress,
monitoring of unit costs;
* development and adoption of simple, clear and transparent financial and accounting policies
which would govem financial management of and accounting for the project;
* regular monitoring of advances given to CIGs, field offices and others, reconciliation and
confirmation of bank balances;
- 89 -



*   at the transaction level, the establishment of procedures and systems for ensuring standard
internal controls such as checking of expenditures, appropriate documentation, levels of
authorization, segregation of incompatible duties, periodic reconciliation, physical verification;
*   establishment and operation of a comprehensive audit mechanism.
Financial Reporting
Project Management Reports would be generated from the computerized financial management
system.
Quarterly Financial Management Reports would include:
*  comparison of budgeted and actual expenditures and analysis of major variances, including
on aspects such as sources of funds (indicating funds from beneficiaries separately) and
application of funds (classified by components, sub-components, summarized expenditure
categories);
*   comparison of budgeted and actual expenditures and analysis of major variances on key
physical parameters and unit rates for selected key items;
*   forecasts for the next two quarters;
*   information on procurement management for major contracts.
Financial Reporting to Local Communities. To make the accounts of the projects implemented
by CIGs transparent to all local stakeholders, a simple summary of the accounts of each such intervention
(amounts received from the members and from the Government, amount spent, and balance) would be
publicly posted in a notice-board in the village.
Staffing and Training
The finance and accounting department of the SPMU would be headed by a Financial Controller,
who would be an accounting professional with about 10-15 years experience in a similar position. The
Financial Controller would have the overall responsibility for all financial and accounting aspects of the
project. The SPMU would also have a Finance Manager who would be a qualified Chartered Accountant
with about 4-5 years of post-qualification experience. The Finance Manager in the SPMU would be
responsible for development, updating and operation of the financial management system of the project,
financial planning and management of the project including financial forecasting.
The finance and accounting sections of the DPMUs would each be headed by an Accounts Officer
who would be an accounting professional with about 4-5 years work experience. Both the SPMU and
DPMUs would have an appropriate number of accountants/account clerks to carry out the various routine
activities under the direction of the key professional staff indicated above. To promote efficiency and
maintain a lean organization, all routine activities relating to generation of books of accounts, compilation,
preparation of financial reports, etc. would be handled through the computerized financial management
system to the maximum extent possible.
An intensive training program is being chalked out to train the accounting personnel at the SPMU
and DPMUs in the operation of the financial management system and the software. Bookkeeping/financial
management would be one of the modules to be covered in the group formation training to be imparted at
the CIG level. CIGs would be trained to maintain proper accounting records for their activities, including
proper records of contributions received and operation of their Project Bank Account.

Auditing Arrangements
The financial statements of the project would be audited by the Accountant General (Audit) of
GOR. The audited annual project financial statements would be submitted to the Bank within 6 months of
the close of GOI's fiscal year. The Department would prepare the financial statements and reconcile the
accounts with the State Accountant Generars figures within 4 months of the close of the GOI fiscal year.
This report would be monitored under ARCS. An agreement will be reached between the GOR, State AG
and IDA on the formats of fnancial statements and terms of reference for the audit.
The following audit reports will be maintained under ARCS:
Ag                                       Audit Report
GOR Department of Rural Development     Project/SOE
GOI Departrnent of Economic Affairs      Special Account
The audit would be carried out in accordance with the Standards of Auditing of the Controller and
Auditor General of India. The audit would be comprehensive and cover all aspects of the project (i.e., all
sources and utilization of funds, and expenditures incurred by all implementing agencies). The Terms of
Reference of the audit would include both audit of financial transactions, and an assessment of the
operation of the financial management system, including review of internal control mechanisms. Special
emphasis would be placed on the audit of the sub-projects being executed by CIGs. The books/records of
the CIGs would be audited by the Project Auditor on sample basis. All sub-projects above US$20,000
would be audited; and about 10 percent of the remaining sub-projects would be audited. Any issues arising
in these audits including systemic issues would be promptly addressed. All implementing agencies would
provide the auditor with access to project-related documents and records, and information required by the
auditor for the purposes of the audit. To ensure that sound internal control is maintained through out
implementation, a CA firm will carry ou an internal financial review on a quarterly basis. The TOR of the
CA frm will be agreed between GOR and the Association in consultation with C&AG, DEA-GOI by May
31, 2000
Time Tablefor Implementation of Project Financial Management System and Next Steps
The computerized Project Financial Management System (PFMS) is being developed for the
project with the help of consultants specifically appointed for the purpose of designing, developing and
instituting the FMS in the project. The FMS manual has been prepared. The computers for the SPMU and
the DPMUs have been procured and installed. The successful implementation of PFMS in the project
would entail the following key activities : (a) fnalization of the financial management software for PFMS
implementation; (b) staffing of key positions; and (c) training of staff in the PFMS operation. The PFMS
is expected to be fully operational by project start-up.
