MORANDUM AND RECOIMDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL BAN K FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE MXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE EGYPTIAN GENERAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION
WITH A GUARANTEE RON THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR A GAS INVESTMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum with recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation for US$84 million equivalent is
submitted for your approval. The loan would be guaranteed by the Arab
Republic of Egypt. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms of 20
years maturity, including a five-year grace period at the standard variable
interest rate and would help finance a Gas Investment Project. The project
would be cofinanced by the European Investment Bank for US$33 million. In
parallel with the project, the Bank/UNDP Energy Sector Management Assistance
Program (ESNAP) would carry out a study on the Cost of Gas Distribution and,
in association with the Global Environment Fund, undertake a Gulf of Suez Gas
Development Study. The Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation and Petrogas
would contribute the balance of the remaining US$168.5 million equivalent of
the project cost.
2.        Sector backuround.  Key sector issues being addressed by the
Government are:  (i) how to entice oil companies to explore and develop
natural gas; and (ii) how to bring domestic prices to international levels.
The Government is encouraging international oil companies to underta'ke gas
exploration by offering attractive terms, and some 134 agreements hive been
signed. However, the demand for gas presently exceeds the supply - a problem
which is expected to persist over the next decade. Given that gas is the
least-cost primary source of energy in Egypt and given the relatively
attractive environmental enefits of its use, supplying natural gas is
accorded a high priority. This project would support the Government in these
efforts. The Bank has financed four projects in the gas subsector, which have
all been completed, with PPARs issued for three. The main lessons learned,
which have been taken into account in designing this project, include: (i) the
resolution of sector issues must be sought through projects; (ii) the
packaging of works must be done so that contractual responsibilities are
properly secured with a view to avoiding tiae slippages; (iii) the project
scope must be sufficiently comprehensive to ensure that the envisioned
benefits can be achieved; and (iv) an appropriate incentive system must be in
place for the benefits to accrue. As regards petroleum product prices, the
Government has undertaken the first two steps in a five-year energy price
reform program in which prices will be increased to international levels by no
later than June 1995.
3.        Bank Stratemy and Rationale for Involvement.  The Bank's country
assistance strategy for Egypt cills for lending for gas investment projects
because of the positive impact freeing oil for export has on the balance of
payments. Energy pricing has been a cornerstone of the Bank's dialogue with
the Government, in view of its importance for energy conservation, budget
support and the current account balance. In 1989 the Government agreed to
increase petroleum product prices to the equivalent of internationally traded
products and to increase electricity prices to LRMC by June 1995. The first



steps toward achieving this goal were lmplemented in 1989 by increasing
weighted average petroleum product prices by 16 percent and electricity prices
by 30 percent. In March 1990, the energy price adjustment agreement with the
Government was upgraded to include annual targets for weighted average
petroleum product prices (starting at 45 percent in May 1990 and increasing at
least 11 percentage points each year thereafter to reach 100 percent by June
1995) and electricity prices (starting at 47 percent of IiMC in May 1990 and
increasing by 10-12 percentage points of LRMC each year thereafter to reach
100 percent of LRMC by June 1995). This program of energy price adjustments
will not only enhance the financial health of the sector but will also have a
substantial impact on the budget deficit. Transfers from the energy sector to
the budget in both FY91 and FY92 are expected to increase by about IL 2
billion (about 2 percent of GDP) in both years. A similar increase in
transfers to the budget is projected for the following year. In May 1990, the
Government fulfilled the first target by increasing weighted average petroleum
product prices by 44 percent and electricity prices by 38 percent. In May
1991, the Government met the agreed upon next step of price increases by
increasing weighted average petroleum product prices by 52 percent and
electricity prices by 50 percent. The Government also addressed the problem
of the structure of energy prices in addition to the level of subsidies to the
sector by targeting products with the highest level of subsidy. Thus, the
Bank has already been effective in persuading the Government to move faster in
setting price incentives which improve the attractiveness of using least-cost
fuels. The rationale for Bank involvement in this project centers on
supporting the Government's energy price reform program, and acting as a
catalyst to attract co-financing for investments in the gas subsector which
complement private sector initiatives and mitigate environmental problems.
4.       Project Objectives. The specific project objectives would be to:
(a) promote the efficient development and utilization of gas resources by
increasing the delivery of natural gas; (b) substitute gas for higher value
tradeable petroleum products to increase the export potential of the latter;
(c) help improve the air quality in the Greater Cairo area by decreasing the
output of carbon dioxide and sulphur oxides; and (d) continue institution
building efforts to increase the commercialization of Petrogas.
5.       Project Desclptioon. The project would consist of the following
components: (i) the Greater Cairo Gas Distribution comnonent to finance the
pipeline and related equipment for extending the existing gas distribution
system to 235,000 additional households, 5,000 commercial and 22 industrial
establishments in Cairo, displ4cing LPG, gas oil and fuel oil; the component
would include training to enhance the commercialization of Petrogas; and (ii)
the Trans Gulf Gas cogmonent to finance gas compressors, gas treatment
facilities and the platform template required for the gathering of an extra 70
mmcfd of gas for delivery to the national grid. Parallel to and in close
association with the project, three additional studies would be performed: a
study to determine an investment plan for the refinery sector that would
address the domestic fuel mix imbalance exacerbated by increased natural gas
supply; a Gulf of Suez Gas Development Study to determine an investment plan
to address the increased use of shut-in and flared associated gas using the
Global Environment Fund and ESMAP resources; and a Cost of Gas Distribution



- 3 -
Study to be carried out by ESNAP. The project has been classified as a
Category B project with regard to its environmental impact; no adverse impact
is expected.
6.        The project would be implemented over a period of six years by EGPC
and Petrogas. The total cost is estimated at US$285.5 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$169.0 million (59 percent). A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. The timetable of key processing events is given in Schedule C and
the status of Bank Group operations in the Arab Republic of Egypt is given in
Schedule D. Maps for the Greater Cairo Gas Distribution Component and Trans
Gulf Gas Component are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9383-
EGT dated June 3, 1991 is being circulated separately.
7.        Actions A8reed.  The Government has instituted an energy price
reform program in which the domestic prices of petroleum products, natural gas
and electricity would be adjusted annually in consultation with the Bank so
that the weighted average petroleum product prices would be 67 percent of
international equivalents by June 1992 and would be increased by at least 11
percentage points in each of the next three years, and electricity prices
would be increased to 69 percent of long-run marginal cost by June 1992 and
further increased by at least 10 percentage points in each of the next three
years. The price increases of bulk natural gas sales would be linked to
domestic fuel oil price increases to reach international fuel oil equivalent
by June 1995. Adjustment in petroleum product prices increases would focus on
increasing the prices for the most heavily subsidized products by an amount
greater than average. In addition, the main actions agreed with GOE, EGPC and
Petrogas are: (i) the consolidated net revenues of EGPC and its subsidiaries
would not be less than 1.5 times the consolidated debt; (ii) margins on
natural gas sales of Petrogas would be maintained such that revenues would be
sufficient for a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 and a self-
financing ratio of not less than 25 percent for gas operations; (iii) the
construction of facilities for the Trans Gulf Gas Component would be
undertaken in accordance with environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank
and the progress reports would include all information regarding adherence to
such standards; (iv) Petrogas would establish a marketing unit within its
organization by June 30, 1992 and would undertake a gas market development
survey by December 31, 1992; (v) the Cost of Gas Distribution Study would be
completed by December 31, 1992; and (vi) the Refinery Sector Investment
Planning Study and the Gulf of Suez Gas Development Plan Study would be
completed by December 31, 1993. Conditions of loan effectiveness
include: (i) conclusion of the EIB Loan Agreement, and fulfillment of all
conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the EIB Loan Agreement; (ii)
execution of a revised contract between Petrogas and Egypt Gas; and (iii)
execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between EGPC and Petrogas.
8.        Justification and Risk.  Economic benefits are expected from
increased gas production of about 70 mmefd; from the substitution of gas in
about 235,000 households, 5,000 commercial establishments and 22 lndustries
for exportable petroleum products amounting to about 8U,O%00 tons of LPG p.a.,



30,000 tons of fuel oil p.a. and 35,000 tons of gas oil p.a. by the year 2000;
and from better capacity utilization of the existing national transmission
network, as well as from the Cairo gas distribution main lines. There would
be significant environmental benefits since gas would displace the petroleum
products used in urban areas. The risks associated with the gas distribution
component concern market penetration. Price incentives to switch to natural
gas use were established ulth the May 3, 1991 energy price adjustments. In
addition, the training components for Petrogas would increase its
commercialization, resulting in increased returns on capital employed. There
are no substautial risks for the Trans Gulf Gas Component.
9.        Regogndati   . I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
