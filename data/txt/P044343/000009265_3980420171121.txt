Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development and Global objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The overall objective of the Biodiversity in Priority Areas Project (BPAP) is to contribute to the integrity of the Honduran
section of the Mesoamnerican Biological Corridor (MBC) through better conservation of biodiversity in core areas and more
sustainable use of biodiversity in the corridor buffer zones. This will be achieved by: (a) improved institutional capacity for
parks management nationally; (b) better and more participatory protection of selected protected areas (PAs); (c) support for
more benign natural resource management activities in the buffer areas; and (d) strengthening of national biological
monitoring capacity.

The project area (see IBRD Map 28851) includes eleven protected areas in four geographic groupings: Cordillera de
Nombre de Dios (Pico Bonito and Texiguat); Patuca-Tawahka (Patuca and Tawahka); Atlantida Wetlands (Cuero y
Salado, Punta Izopo, Punta Sal); and Mosquitia (Laguna de Caratasca, Rus-Rus, Warunta, and Mocor6n).
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):

3. Benefits and target population:
An important benefit is conservation of biodiversity of global importance. Local communities in MBC will also directly
benefit from investments in buffer zones and in the PAs. National benefits will derive from overall strengthening of
institutional capacity to manage PAs. In addition, the project will foster development of the National System of Protected
Areas (SINAPH) as a destination for ecotourists which is expected to generate significant benefits for the Honduran
economy over the medium to long term.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: Five years            Executing agency: AFE-COHDEFOR through DAPVS
Project coordination: The project will be carried out by AFE-COHDEFOR through DAPVS. In addition to a center of
operations in Tegucigalpa, regional operational centers will be located in Mocor6n for the Mosquitia region, La Ceiba for
the Atlantic region, and Catacamas for the region of Olancho. Other than direct interventions in the PAs, most investments
under the project will be implemented by decentralized entities such as municipalities, NGOs, indigenous organizations, and
local communities, coordinated by AFE-COHDEFOR. Implementation will be closely coordinated with the Rural Land
Management Project (PAAR).
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): Project oversight will be responsibility of AFE-COHDEFOR, the Secretariat of
Natural Resources and the Environment (SERNA) and the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG). As joint
implementing agencies of this project, both UNDP and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank)
will provide technical and financial supervision during implementation of the project.
Accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements: AFE-COHDEFOR will be responsible for project financial
management, reporting, and auditing following procedures acceptable both to the Bank and to UNDP. UNDP will
administer the GEF grant funds through its Resident Mission in Honduras, and will be responsible for disbursements. The
financial management system to be maintained in AFE-COHDEFOR for the project will be consistent with that established
for the associated PAAR, which has been deemed to be satisfactory. The Project Coordination Unit for the BPAP will have
access to financial and audit reports to ensure complementarity of expenditures on activities included in both projects.
Project accounts will be audited annually, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and to UNDP. The annual audit
report will be submitted to the Bank and to UNDP within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The project administration unit will establish project monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) procedures acceptable to both the Bank and to UNDP. These will build on procedures already in place under the
PAAR. Procedures and M&E reports will be guided by: (a) the Project Design Summary (Annex 1); and (b) the
Monitoring Plan as detailed in the Operational Manual. M&E is to be conducted through: (a) activities of the project
administration unit; (b) Bank/IJNDP supervision missions; (c) supervision of the UNDP Resident Mission in Honduras; (d)
annual progress review during Bank/UNDP supervision rnissions not later than July 31 of each year starting in 1998; (d)
Mid-term Review of project implementation to be carried out jointly by GOH, the Bank, and UNDP; (e) periodic
beneficiary assessments and other special studies; and (f) analysis of the results of the Biological Monitoring Component

and of monitoring data available through the regional Mesoamerican Biological Corridor Project. Quarterly, the project
administration unit will transmit to the Bank and UNDP progress reports on project implementation and outcomes, using
the format agreed at negotiations. An Implementation Completion Report will be prepared within six months after the
closing of the grant.
The seven key indicators as listed in the Project Design Summary (Annex 1) are:
. No discernible decline in core area forest cover from the baseline;
. Management plans reflect consensus built at national, regional, and local levels around the concept of core and buffer
zones;
* DAPVS is more capable and willing to implement management plans;
. Increased knowledge and adoption of biodiversity-friendly land use alternatives by communities in the buffer zones;
* Increase in the number of beneficiaries in buffer zones that take an active role in protected areas management;
* Establishment of the biodiversity monitoring database by 1998 and installation on computers of four regional offices
and central office;
* Demarcation of 350 kilometers of the core areas.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objectives supported by the project:                       Document number and date of latest CAS
(a) Sustainable natural resource management; and (b) Poverty alleviation.  discussion:
Specific areas in the CAS which this project addresses are: improving  August 1993 in cojunction with Board discussion
natural resource management, including forestry; conserving biodiversity;  ofthe Agricultural Sector Adjushnat Credit
and gaining a consensus on priority areas.                        (AGSAC) (Credit 2450-HO)
GEF Operational Strategy/Program Objective addressed by the project:
Conservation of biodiversity of global importance within the Honduran parts of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor
(MBC) with sustainable use of its components and fair and equitable sharing of its benefits.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Sector issues:
1. More than half of Honduras' forests have already been converted to other uses, with more than three quarters of the
loss occurring only in the last thirty years. Policy and legislation prior to the 1990s in the area of land and forest
management encouraged deforestation and poor soil and water management (more recently, the government has begun to
pursue policies to implement a more balanced natural resource management strategy, by adopting a more decentralized and
participatory approach and strengthening the concerned sector institutions).
2. Inconsistently applied land reforrn programs, combined with poor land registration systems, have led to tenure
insecurity and discouraged investment. This also contributes to uncontrolled occupation of national and municipal forest
lands for pasture and cultivation.
3. Honduras' protected areas system (SINAPH) is also fundamental to protection of biodiversity resources and consists
of 107 protected areas, representing 24 percent of the Honduran territory. However, as much as half of this area has
already been converted from natural forest to agricultural uses and very few areas receive adequate attention to foster
management or real protection against external pressures. The geographic distribution of the protected areas and the
patterns of management resource allocation are also not consistent with an overall goal of maximizing biodiversity
conservation within the protected area system.
4. The Protected Areas Department in AFE-COHDEFOR was only created in 1991 and has only recently received
significant financing from the forestry agency. Staff are still too few, devolution of management responsibilities to NGOs
and local government is still nascent, and most staff are poorly trained.

Government's strategy to address these sectoral concerns is focused at various levels:
. Government is implementing a Rural Land Management Project (PAAR) with IDA-financing (Credit 2940-HO) which
will tackle the first two categories of sector issues mentioned above. PAAR builds on policy changes initiated through a
1992 Agricultural Modernization Law, which eliminated distorted agricultural policies, rationalized land and forest tenure,
and restructured land and forest agencies, taking government out of timber marketing, and eliminating timber concessions,
and instituting a timber auction system in public lands. It also endorsed the SINAPH and AFE-COHDEFOR's
responsibility to put areas under active management. PAAR finances modernization of land registration, priority forest
management with local participation, strengthening of AFE-COHDEFOR, technical assistance to upland farmers and
forest producers, and strengthening selected protected area infrastructure to generate revenues to help sustain the SINAPH
over time.
* In regard to the third issue, internationally, Government is a signatory to the Central American Biodiversity
Convention and the International Convention on Biological Diversity. Regionally, Honduras is an active member of the
Central American Commission on Environment and Development (CCAD) and is a signatory of the Alliance for
Sustainable Development (Alhanza para el Desarrollo Sostenible), signed in 1994 by all Central American heads of state.
Honduras is part of a regional , umbrella project for the protection of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) being
prepared by CCAD for GEF financing.
* Nationally, a draft Biodiversity Conservation Strategy has been prepared and will be finalized under a forthcoming
UNDP-implemented GEF enabling activities grant. The Natural Resources and Environment Secretariat (Secretaria de
Recursos Naturales y del Ambiente, SERNA) has formed a consultative body for biodiversity strategy decisions under the
National Enviromnent Commission and which includes SERNA, the protected areas agency (DAPVS) in AFE-
COHDEFOR, the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (Secretaria de Agricultura y Ganader{a, SAG), the Tourism
Institute, NGOs, and the private sector. GOH also has prepared PLANFOR, a national forestry action plan.
. Complementing these institutional initiatives, the Government of Honduras, with assistance from donors and
intemational development organizations, is financing many important conservation programs.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The BPAP complements the PAAR and the regional umbrella MBC project to address the third and fourth sector issues.
To address limited protected areas management, the project will finance participatory managemnent and demarcation of
priority areas within the SINAPH, and buffer zone sustained use and development, cooperating with envirommental NGOs,
local government, and indigenous and local communities. To address weak institutions, the project finances DAPVS staff
upgrading and in-service training and a training program for private and community organizations and NGOs involved in
sustainable use and biodiversity conservation in the project area. Complementary actions by PAAR will provide a means
to sustain the increased investment in the Honduran section of the MBC over time by creating a fund for protected areas
that can be replenished directly from revenues from the protected areas as well as through payments for environmental
services rendered in other sectors. In support of the large indigenous population in the project area, PAAR will help to
define land tenure and land rights and support culturally-sensitive development in the buffer zones.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The main objective of the project is to put in place measures to assure the conservation of the MBC in core areas over the
long-term. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection include: (a) covering more of the 22 priority protected areas,
rejected so as not to diffuse institutional capacity and because of complementary projects financed by bilateral donors; (b)
financing buffer zone activities throughout the project area, rejected in favor of concentrating efforts on the Mosquitia and
Tawakha where less NGO and donor financing was available; (c) depending on the regional project for biological
monitoring, rejected given the limited funds available and the need to develop the capacity for information management at
the local level; and (d) adjudicating indigenous land and forest rights in the protected areas, rejected since it would be best
addressed through Government's on-going titling program and by demarcating traditional use areas during core and buffer
zone demarcation.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
A reviewer from the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) roster of experts recommended consideration of the:
(a) Value of corridors to protect otherwise isolated islands of biodiversity; (b) Importance of incorporating local
communities and local governments into biodiversity conservation planning; (c) Need for financial mechanisms to fully
cover operational costs; and (d) Importance of institutional strengthening of agencies responsible for conservation. These
comments were incorporated into the project design.
11. Indications of Borrower commitment and ownership:
Honduras is signatory to many regional and intemational biodiversity conventions which provide conceptual framework for
this project; the country is committed to key sector reforms. Willingness to borrow for these reforms through the PAAR is
an indication of commitment.

12. Value added of Bank and GEF support:
GEF support is warranted because of the global significance of the MBC and the need for incremental financing for its
long-term protection. The project is being jointly supported by both the Bank and UNDP, thereby drawing on the
comparative advantage of each institution and ensuring cooperation between regional and national programs. Value added
of Bank support lies in technical support for preparation, supervision capacity, and development of linkages with the
PAAR.

(see Annex 4)                Analysis: N/A                                              Cost Analysis]
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5):
Financial sustainability of SINAPH (generation of revenues and financial management) is key element of project concept.
Studies were carried out under BPAP and PAAR project preparation to evaluate feasibility of a Protected Areas Fund,
being established under the PAAR, to be partially endowed through revenues from protected areas investments. The studies
estimated potential revenue streams, anticipated tourism growth based on nature tourism, and analyzed alternative financial
funds structured. Annex 5 summarizes the anticipated financial stream based on the findings of the feasibility studies.
15. Technical Assessment:
Notable technical issues dealt with during project preparation include the nature of appropriate investments in buffer zones
that balance both promotion of local community development and defense of biodiversity in core areas and buffer zones of
protected areas. Other issues include indigenous land tenure concerns, the balance of gender in project activities, and the
appropriateness of buffer zone activities. Appropriate type and levels of investments in protected areas were also
considered in depth in a number of background studies.
16. Institutional Assessment:
Executing agencies: Weakness of AFE-COHDEFOR and DAPVS is of major concern. Project includes institutional
strengthening and intends to decentralize administration of some components to regional and local organizations. It will
complement activities of conservation NGOs in the Atlantic coast that are being financed by Fundaci6n VIDA, a Honduran
conservation foundation.
GEF implementing agencies. UJNDP and the Bank will both serve as GEF implementing agencies, the first experience of
this kind in Latin America, using unified criteria for implementation to simplify the reporting and administrative procedures
of AFE-COHDEFOR and GOH.
Project management: The project will be managed by AFE-COHDEFOR through DAPVS. Three regional DAPVS field
offices will be strengthened in the project area, which will provide staff greater presence and outreach. Activities financed
under this project will be coordinated with activities being financed through the PAAR within AFE-COHDEFOR and
through the PAAR's Coordination Unit at the Ministerial level.
The project will support the creation of regional committees for protected areas management (Consejos Regionales de
Areas Protegidas, CORAPs) and local committees for protected areas management (Consejos Locales de Areas
Protegidas, COLAPs) which will coordinate training inputs at the regional and protected areas level, and the local
committees will also prioritize requests for buffer zone activities. Regional DAPVS offices and the CORAP/COLAP will
coordinate complementary activities funded by Fundacion VIDA. SERNA will take the lead on strategic issues related to
the SINAPH and will preside over the Council for Protected Areas, which is the institution with responsibility for priority
setting and financing strategies.
17. Social Assessment:
The social assessment included: (a) a natural resource analysis, with field data; (b) a gender analysis with field survey data
and a literature review; (c) an indigenous land tenure study; and (d) an analysis of indigenous issues. A Social Assessment,
Participation Plan, and an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan have been prepared (the Project Document annexes the

complete report). The total indigenous population affected by the project is approximately 78,000, including the Miskito,
Pech, Tawahka, and Garifuna. The social assessment analyzed the different patterns of land use and productive systems
among the indigenous and non-indigenous people living in the buffer zones and identified and assessed the capacity of
community-based organizations and NGOs. The role of women in biodiversity conservation was specifically addressed by a
gender specialist during preparation.
Land Tenure. For the indigenous peoples in the buffer zones, there are constraints to recognition of indigenous land and
forest rights. The legal study evaluated three options for indigenous land tenure titling: individual, communal, and usufruct
contract all of which are options in the Honduran legal framework. Based on the findings of the draft study, GOH has
decided to further evaluate these options and may opt to apply a blend of usufruct and communal title. In addition, an
ongoing Institutional Development Fund grant will strengthen the capacity of indigenous communities and organizations to
formulate proposals and document their land tenure claims. Regardless of the option selected, GOH is committed to
protecting traditional use rights.
Implementation Capacity. The existing capacity of the PAAR Project Coordination Unit to implement the participation plan
is limited. To address this, SAG will contract a specialist in social and participation issues who would coordinate with the
BPAP to incorporate these issues into project components, ensure implementation of the participation plan, and supervise
consultants contracted for specific studies or activities. Additional social science staff will be recruited into DAPVS who
will work with the promotional staff of AFE-COHDEFOR and NGO personnel.
Local Capacity. Existing community-based organizations and farmers groups lack the capacity to actively participate in the
local and regional committees for protected areas management. Training and capacity-building resources will be made
available to strengthen the capacity of members of the COLAPs, CORAPs, NGOs, and other organizations. Through the
process of participatory planning, management plans for the core and buffer zone areas will be developed and the
subprojects to be supported by the buffer zone fund will be developed and prioritized, and then endorsed by the committees.
Environmental education materials will be designed to promote broad participation in protected areas management.
Gender. Men and women have unequal access to land and agricultural and forestry production services, and different needs
for information and technologies. To address gender needs and opportunities, a program of gender training would be
designed and implemented for the agencies and NGOs involved in the project, and buffer zone activities will be targeted to
female producers and entrepreneurs.
18. Environmental Assessment: Environmental Category   [I   A         [XI   B            [ ]   C
Minor impacts are possible from some infrastructure investments in protected areas and in buffer zones. The basic
screening and evaluation procedures of DAPVS, previously developed and analyzed in the context of PA investments to be
done under the PAAR, have been evaluated during preparation missions and are considered appropriate.

Note: Information Sharing (IS), Consultation (CON), and Collaboration (COL)
Project preparation included an analysis of the stakeholders in the land administration and natural resource sectors and
regional consultation workshops, carried out by a multi-disciplinary team, with representatives of stakeholders living in the
buffer zones of the protected areas of the project. A meeting was held with NGOs working with farmers and forest
producers in the buffer zone areas and there were consultations with the national indigenous confederation (CONPAH) and
representatives of indigenous and non-indigenous communities in the project areas. During project implementation, the
COLAPs and CORAPs will be the focus point for participatory involvement in decision-making and carrying out of
activities.

20. Sustainability:
Project sustainability will be promoted through: (a) improvement of the ability of local and national institutions to provide
technical assistance on sustainable land use and to address land tenure issues (primarily through the PAAR); (b) support for
a self-financing mechanism for the SINAPH, also to be supported primarily under PAAR; (c) increasing public support for
the protected areas and participation in their management, by working closely with many stakeholders; (d) institutional
strengthening; and (e) investments and conceptual support from the regional Mesoamerican Biological Corridor Project
(UNDP-administered).

Indigenous land rights in buffer and core areas is always controversial. Mitigating measures are explicitly included in
project design, in the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan, and in the PAAR.

Honduras Biodiversity in Priority Areas Project
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - Strengthening of DAPVS and Local Capacity for PA Management - US$ 2.6 million
This component will: (a) strengthen DAPVS at national level but primarily at the field office and protected area
levels; (b) build local capacity for PA management through training and workshops for NGOs, local government, members
of the regional protected areas management committees (CORAPs), and members of the local protected areas management
committees (COLAPs); and (c) provide coordination support for project implementation. Financing will be provided for:
(a) development of in-service training courses and periodic in-depth courses for DAPVS staff; (b) curricula and courses for
regional committee members, NGOs involved in protected areas and buffer zone activities, and for staff of complementary
biodiversity projects in the project area; (c) demand-driven training and study tours or interactions among members of the
COLAPs, including community-based organizations, productive organizations, indigenous organizations and federations,
and private sector stakeholders; and (d) a project coordinator, operational expenditures, monitoring and evaluation, and
special studies. In addition, funds will be provided for studies and consensus-building activities to complement the national
biodiversity strategy and improve the capacity for the development of management plans for core and buffer areas of the
SINAPH. The consensus-building will draw upon the information available from the ecosystems map that has been
prepared under the PAAR, which will assist in agreeing on priorities for protection and sustainable use.
Project Component 2 - Management of Globally Important Protected. Areas - US$ 4.6 million
Tlhis component will finance: (a) management plans for the protected areas which are globally important and which
do not have complementary financing from other donors for elaboration of participatory management and operational plans;
(b) demarcation of core and buffer zones, with complementary delimitation of lands with indigenous property claims; (c)
construction of one visitor's center in the Atlantic zone to expand the potential to attract and manage tourists in one
protected area; (d) recruit personnel for protection of the protected areas; and (e) construction of park guard facilities in
each protected areas, including the acquisition and utilization of goods required to the operation of such facilities.
Project Component 3 - Improving Natural Resource Management in Buffer Zones - US$ 1.9 million
This component will finance buffer zone investments that are identified during the elaboration of the protected areas
management plans in the Mosquitia region (including Patuca-Tawahka, Caratasca, Warunta, Rus-Rus) that will be carried
out by groups of individuals within the communities in the buffer zones of the protected areas. Financing will be channeled
to groups selected by the COLAPs. Funds transferred will be approved by DAPVS. Subproject proposals that are not
identified through the management plan process, which are submitted by the COLAPs, can also be considered by DAPVS,
based on the no-objection of UNDP and the Bank. In parallel, residents of the buffer zones of all protected areas included
in the project will be eligible to submit proposals for technical assistance to the Upland Producers Fund through the PAAR.
Project Component 4 - Biological Monitoring - US$ 0.3 million
This component will establish a monitoring system to determine major changes in the status of biodiversity in the
corridor. Specifically, the project will finance: (a) installation of computer and software in four regional offices and at
headquarters; (b) purchase and interpretation of satellite images to generate a baseline and comparative analyses of the
project area; (c) 2 overflights and four field visits to project area; (c) collection and analysis of data derived from on-the-
ground surveillance by park guards and others; and (d) two annual workshops on monitoring.

Honduras Biodiversity in Priority Areas Project
Incremental Cost Analysis Summary
Context and Broad Development Goals
1.    The rapidly fragmenting natural habitats of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) within
Honduras is of great concern for the country and for the international community. The erosion of the country's
biodiversity riches is taking place within a context of natural resource mismanagement in poverty-stricken rural
areas and of little institutional capacity for managing the protected area network (SINAPH).
2.    The broad development goals of the country focus on poverty alleviation strategies, land reform, and
improvements in natural resource management in the MBC and other rural areas of Honduras. Many of the
reforms are being supported under a series of World Bank loans including the Agricultural Sector Credit and
PAAR. A SINAPH of 107 protected areas is a testimony to the interest of the country in conserving its rich
biodiversity but the existing protected areas are being rapidly swamped by the advancing agricultural frontier and
resources are insufficient to adequately protect even a core group of protected areas.
Baseline Scenario
3.    A multi-pronged approach to the problem is being adopted by the Government of Honduras (GOH),
assisted by an array of bilateral and multilateral donors. In the absence of GEF assistance for addressing global
biodiversity objectives, this approach can be considered the "Baseline Scenario. It involves tackling root causes,
such as natural resource mismanagement and land tenure problems, as well as limited direct support to
biodiversity conservation in the protected area system.
4.    Given that Honduras is one of the poorest countries in Latin America, the priorities of the GOH are
concentrated on interventions that have an immediate impact on rural poverty. In the baseline scenario, the GOH
would be expected to use its scarce development resources for pursuing three broad lines of development: (a)
reform of land tenure problems representing important impediments to local development (US$ 15.0 million); (b)
improving the management of natural resources, particularly public forest management, so as to have an
immediate impact in terms of poverty alleviation and food security in the poorest rural areas of the country (US$
19.0 rnillion); and (c) support for protected areas with potential for generating revenues (US$ 7.0 million). The
estimated cost of these activities is US$ 41.0 million, and the principal vehicle adopted by the GOH to carry out
these development goals is the PAAR.
5.   In addition to this initiative, complementary investments of the bilateral and multilateral donor community
are an important part of the Baseline Scenario in the Honduran section of the MEBC. These donor initiatives also
focus on land tenure, natural resource management, and protection efforts, but they tend to be geographically
focused on relatively small areas and do not address sectoral root causes. The most important donor initiatives
are the following: (a) a proposed Japanese investment of about US$ 11.0 million in fisheries and coastal zone
management in the Mosquitia area; (b) German investment of US$ 9.0 million in the sustainable development of
the Rio Platano watershed; (c) Canadian investment of US$ 3.0 million in sustainable forest management of
tropical broad leaf forests of north-central Honduras; (d) European Union funding of about US$ 2.0 million in
sustainable development of rural areas of northern Honduras (not in protected areas); (e) Finnish investment of
about US$ 1.0 million in social forestry investments and research in pine forests; (f) USAID funding of about
US$ 300,000 in the Gulf of Fonseca area (PROARCA Program), and (g) Fundaci6n VIDA financing of about

Country: Honduras                                                    Project Title: Biodiversity in Priority Areas Project
US$ 1.2 million of NGO initiatives for protected areas management in selected areas of the country. The total
cost of these donor programs is estimated at approximately US$ 29.0 million.
6.    The total cost of Baseline Scenario investments of the GOH and donor community, as described here, is
estimated at US$ 70.0 million; implementation of this investment program will be important to the development
of Honduras. At least in some areas of the country, much improved natural resource management practices
should be adopted as a result, leading to rural poverty alleviation and enhanced protection of the resources
themselves. This will be particularly true for fisheries use in Mosquitia and the Gulf of Fonseca and for isolated
areas under forestry exploitation. A strengthened institutional capacity in the sector can be expected, and this
will generate benefits directly or indirectly in the entire country and in the MBC. Significant progress should be
made in resolving land administration conflicts in some less conflictive regions of the country. Finally, through
investments in protected areas under the PAAR, basic infrastructure and capacity should be in place to protect a
few key areas and to help generate nature-based tourism revenues.
7.    In terms of protecting biodiversity, these results are positive in that they should help slow the advance of
the agricultural frontier by promoting more intensive agriculture and forestry. In areas that are under
exploitation, particularly forestry, better natural resource management practices may have direct benefits for
biodiversity by preserving better quality habitat patches. Finally, the direct investments in a handful of PAs will
be important in safeguarding those particular areas. Increasing revenues generated by the PA system should
benefit protected areas throughout the country, but in the short term, revenue generation will be modest.
8.    Despite these positive elements, the Baseline Scenario would not result in effective protection of
biodiversity conservation in the MBC of Honduras. Investments and land use planning decisions would be not
aimed at protecting the corridor and no effective mechanisms would be in place to monitor the integrity of such
corridors (although regionally oriented monitoring programs are expected under the UNDP-administered
Regional Mesoamerican Corridor Project). Under the Baseline Scenario, fragmentation and conversion of
natural habitats would continue, resulting within one or two generations in the reduction of the Honduran section
of the MBC to nothing more than a few isolated protected areas and indigenous reserves.
Global Environmental Objective
9.    The global environmental biodiversity objective in Central America, as strongly promoted by the Global
Environment Facility and conservation experts throughout the world, is to protect and conserve a relatively intact
corridor of natural habitat stretching from southern Mexico to Colombia, bridging the North and South American
continents. Within Honduras, this translates into defining and protecting a number of key habitat corridors which
collectively define the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor in that country. The Honduran section of the MBC
contains major portions of five terrestrial ecoregions: Central American Pacific dry forests; Central American
pine-oak forests; Central American montane forests at higher altitudes; Central American Atlantic moist forests;
and the Miskito pine forests of eastern Honduras. Each of these ecoregions contains high levels of endemic
species of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and vascular plants as well as endangered mammal species.
GEF Alternative
10.   Under the GEF Alternative, an expanded program would be undertaken which would comprise activities
focused on national development/poverty alleviation goals as well as activities focused on protecting the
Honduran portion of the MBC. The GEF Alternative would consist of the following Baseline Activities: (a)
reform of land tenure problems (US$ 15.0 million); (b) improving management of natural resources, particularly
forest management (US$ 20.0 million); (c) support for protected areas with revenue earning potential (US$ 8.0

million); (d) complementary donor programs in the MBC (US$ 28.0 million), including investments by Fundaci6n
VIDA in NGO activities along the Atlantic coast, plus the following MBC Biodiversity Conservation Activities:
(e) institutional strengthening for protected area and natural resource management, including local capacity
building (US$ 0.65 million); (t) protected areas strengthening in globally significant sites within the Honduran
segment of the MBC (US$ 4.05 million); (g) improving resource management in the buffer zones, including
promotion of appropriate technologies, integrating biodiversity conservation/use with sustainable forestry, and
gender-sensitive biodiversity initiatives at the local level (US$ 1.6 million); (h) biological monitoring (US$ 0.4
million); and (i) project coordination costs (US$ 0.3 million). The total cost of the GEF Alternative is estimated
at US$ 77.0 million.
11.   Implementation of the GEF Alternative is expected to generate both national benefits (those outlined
under the Baseline Scenario) as well as global benefits related to the establishment of the Mesoamerican
Biological Corridor within Honduras. Implementation of the GEF Alternative would make possible critical
activities that would not otherwise take place in the absence of GEF funding. These additional activities, which
would generate global benefits, would include:
a) On-the-ground investments in protected area creation and management in four areas considered of the
highest global biodiversity importance: Cordillera de Nombre de Dios, Patuca-Tawahka, Atlantida Wetlands,
and Mosquitia;
b) The protected areas agency (DAPVS) of the GOH will be institutionally strengthened within the Corridor,
allowing it to manage more effectively the globally significant PAs as well as other portions of the Corridor;
c) The incipient national dialogue on the country's draft Biodiversity Strategy will be supported and
strengthened, contributing to a national consensus on priorities for action and providing a framework for
national investments and donor assistance;
d) Communities living in and around globally significant protected areas will benefit from a series of investments
in natural resource use and management which will demonstrate and support altemative resource use options,
thereby slowing movement into these protected areas;
e) A variety of participatory and consultative mechanisms will be utilized (including environmental education
and gender-based programs) in order to bring communities into the process of protected area management
and to ensure more effective local management of globally important PAs; and
f) Closely coordinated with GEF-supported efforts under the Regional project, a biological monitoring program
will be supported in Honduras to help better manage the Corridor as well as to facilitate and orient future
investments.
Incremental Costs
12.   The total cost of the Baseline Scenario is estimated at US$ 70 million, while the total cost of the GEF
Altemative is estimated at US$ 77.0 million. The incremental costs of the GEF Altemative, for which GEF
funding is requested, are US$ 7.0 million. It is expected that with the definition of a biological corridor and an
associated framework of priorities, additional bilateral funds will be mobilized to complement and reinforce GEF-
supported efforts.

Honduras Biodiversity in Priority Areas Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement of works and goods financed by the Bank and UNDP under the project would be carried out in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995, revised in
January and August 1996). Consultant services to provide technical assistance and training would be procured in
accordance with Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing
Agency (January 1997), consistent with the UNDP-Bank cost sharing agreement (February 1994). As applicable,
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would use the Bank-issued Standard Bidding Documents for the procurement of
goods and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) would be based on standard bidding documents acceptable to the Bank.
Procurement would be undertaken by the Project Coordination Unit together with UNDP, as well as by
beneficiaries implementing subprojects.
Special Provisions. Additional special provisions have been specified in Schedule 3, Section III of the GEF Trust
Fund Grant Agreement regarding contracts, bids, and consultants.
Subgrants (Upland Fund) consist of packages of small civil works, goods, and technical assistance with an
expected average cost of approximately US$ 25,000. In order to encourage community participation in project execution,
and given the remote location of many rural communities, direct contracting may be permitted to implement subprojects up
to a maximum amount by subproject of US$ 10,000.
Consultant Services are expected to cost approximately US$ 1.3 million and would be procured in accordance
with the Bank's procedures for hiring of consultants (see Table A).
Bank prior review thresholds are shown in Table B. Annual procurement audits would be carried out to ensure
that the procurement procedures specified in the GEF Trust Fund Grant Agreement and the operational manual for the
project are being followed. The annual procurement audits would be carried out by an external auditor contracted under
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank and UNDP.
Disbursements
Allocation of grant proceeds: Disbursements would be made against the categories of expenditures indicated in
Table C. The proceeds of the proposed Grant are expected to be disbursed over a period of five years. The project is
expected to be completed by July 31, 2002 and the Grant Closing Date would be January 31, 2003.
Use of Statements of Expenditures: UNDP will administer the GEF grant funds through its Resident Mission in
Honduras and will be responsible for disbursements. Disbursements would be made directly to UNDP and would function
similarly to a special account. An initial advance sufficient for expenditures of up to six months would be made and
subsequently replenished based on acceptable reporting of eligible expenditures made from the advance. Withdrawal
applications would be fully documents, except for expenditures under contracts for goods (other than vehicles) costing less
than US$ 150,000 equivalent, contracts for works costing less than US$ 500,000 equivalent, contracts for consulting firms
costing less than US$ 50,000 equivalent, contracts for individual consultants costing less than US$ 25,000 equivalent,
training, salaries and operating costs, and subgrants. Supporting documentation for such expenditures would be retained by
the implementing agency and made available for auditors and Bank staff as requested.
Retroactive Financing: At negotiations, retroactive financing of up to US$ 700,000 equivalent (10 percent of the
Grant amount SDR 510,000) was reviewed and agreed for any eligible expenditures incurred after August 1, 1997 (but not
earlier than 12 months before Grant signing).
