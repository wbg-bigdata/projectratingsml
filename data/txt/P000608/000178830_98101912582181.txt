HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Economic Setting
1.01      The Republic of Djibouti, with an area of 22,000 sq km and loca-
ted at the mouth of the Red Sea, became independent in June 1977. The cli-
mate is arid and hot, similar to the adjoining desert areas of Ethiopia and
Somalia. The country is topographically divided in two parts along an axis
created by the Gulf of Tadjourah (see Map). The south, including the capi-
tal of Djibouti City, is relatively flat and almost uniformly covered with
boulders, while the north, including the city of Tadjourah, is a rocky,
mountainous region, making building and maintaining roads difficult and ex-
pensive.   An estimated two thirds of its indigenous population of about
325,000 (1979) live in Djibouti City; the rest are scattered in a few small
towns or are semi-nomadic pastoralists. The country's economy consists of
three main economic sub-units: (a) Djibouti City with its port/railway ter-
minal and airport and Government services; (b) a French military base, the
country's largest single source of economic and commercial activity; and
(c) the sparsely populated hinterland where the main activities are live-
stock raising - cattle, sheep and camels - and cultivation of fruits and
vegetables near towns.  The estimated per capita income is $420 per annum
(1979).  While this level is much higher than that of neighboring Ethiopia
and Somalia (e.g. $130 for Ethiopia), it is not evident that the standard
of living is substantially different, especially in the hinterland where
sources of income are limited and poverty extreme.
B. Transport System - General
1.02        The transport system of Djibouti comprises about 2,800 km of
roads and tracks, 110 km of railway, a port, and an international airport
and several airstrips.   There are no navigable waterways.   The most im-
portant part of the system is centered around Djibouti City with its inter-
national airport, port and railway terminal.   About 300 km of roads are
paved, including the 217 km link between Djibouti City and the Ethiopian
border; the remaining 83 km are city streets.   Connections to the rest of
the country, mostly along some 2,500 km of ill- defined earth tracks, are
very poor.   A single ferry-boat provides the only reliable surface link
between Djibouti City and Tadjourah, the most important town in the
northern part of the country.



(a) Railway
1.03        The Ethiopia-Djibouti railway built in 1917 links the po^t of
Djibouti and Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.   Some 95% of the riil-
way's traffic originates from or is destined for Ethiopia for whicrà the
line is an important outlet to the sea.  Even though Djibouti's share of
the traffic is small, a treaty ratified in 1981 gives Djibouti equal w,Light
in the railway's management, an equal share of profits but a 10% share of
deficits.   Traffic on the system declined from 370,000 tons in 19-;5 to
about 170,000 tons in 1981 partly due to a shift in Ethiopian traffic from
the port of Djibouti to the Ethiopian port of Assab.   Also, the lin  was
closed from June  3977 to June  1978 due  to disturbances  in the O0aden
region.  Since reopening, operations have been limited to two trains a day
in each direction compared to eight previously. Because of the low traffic
the railway is losing money (about US$825,000 in 1980).
1.04       The EDF, following a study of the railway's short-term needs, is
providing about US$13 million for the purchase of two diesel locomotivas,
maintenance equipment and spare parts. Longer-term needs may include sDme
track renewal and additional purchases of rolling stocke   However,  the
timing and justification for this will depend on the future prospects of
Ethiopian traffic on the line which is difficult  to predict given that
country's current preference for the Addis-Assab road transport corridor.
(b)  Port
1.06        The port: of Djibouti is the terminal of the Ethiopia-Djibouti
railway and served as an important bunkering port in the past.  After the
French military base, it is the next major generater of economic activi.ty
in the country.  It is relatively vell equipped with eight inside bertIs,
one outside berth and four fuelling posts.   The depth of seven of the
berths slightly exceeds 9 meters and the two remaining are used by coa3tal
shipping having only a 3.5 meter depth. The port's warehousing space, 'E.r-
go handling facilities and maintenance facilities  are adequate.   Total
traffic in the port declined from 640,891 tons in 1976 to 370,063 tonw in
1979, due to an 80% reduction in Ethiopian traffic.   The port's bunker-ing
business has suffered from the advent of newer, longer-range ships and eam-
petition from the Arabian states.   The port incurred a deficit of DF 142
million in 1980 or about 15% of total receipts. To find ways of attracl:ing
traffic and increasing port utilization, the Government wiith assistLnce
from France recently completed a feasibility study carried out by con ul-
tants of a container terminal for the port.   The study concluded that a
container facility, at an estimated cost of DF 2.4 billion (US$13.7 milliDn
equivalent), would increase transshipment in the port and help render its
operations viable.   Detailed design for the terminal has also been ton-
pleted by consultants.   Although the consultants'  traffic projections  Ln
the study appear optimistic, especially given competition from other pcr:s
in the region, the first two of three construction phases are expected -o
be financed by Kuwait and Germany with works scheduled to begin soon (by
June 1982).  The third phase is expected to be carried out towards the end
of the 1980s.

(c) Air Transport
1.07       Djibouti's international airport is an autonomous public enter-
prise which reports to the Ministry of Commerce, Tourism and Transport. It
has a 3,140 m long runway and facilities capable of accomodating fully
loaded B-747's. Service is provided by Air Djibouti, the national carrier,
and six foreign airlines1/.   In addition there are 10 airstrips in the
country but only two of these, Tadjourah and Obock, have scheduled service
provided by Air Djibouti.
1.08       Air passenger traffic grew by about 3% p.a. from 1975 to 240,596
in 1980.  About half of these were in transit.  During 1977, 1978 and part
of 1979, Uganda transshipped most of its coffee through Djibouti causing a
surge in freight traffic at the airport, but since these shipments have
stopped, freight traffic has dropped by 76% to its current level of about
7,800 tons.   Because of the excess capacity, the airport is not able to
operate profitably and must be subsidized indirectly by the French govern-
ment.   It is not expected that this situation will change in the near
future.
1.09       Air Djibouti, established in 1980 is owned 92% by Government and
8% by Air France. Its fleet includes two twin-otters which are used on do-
mestic and regional services and a recently purchased B-727 which also
operates on its regional network as well as providing weekly flights to
Europe.   To protect  its own airline,  the Government has  forced other
airlines,  in particular Air France,  to cut back the number of flights
serving Djibouti.   In spite of this Air Djibouti required a subsidy of
about US$3.0 million in 1980.
C. The Road Subsector
(i) The Network
1.10       The road network consists of about 2,800 km of roads, of which
300 km are paved and 2,500 km are earth roads and tracks. The paved roads
include a 217 km road from Djibouti City to the Ethiopian border, the major
road axis of the country. This road, built over a 30-year period from the
early 1950's to the early 1980's, is in fair to good condition.  The first
section, Djibouti to Arta (30 km), completed in 1953, needs rehabilitation,
while the middle section, the Grand Bara (25 km) completed in 1981, needs
resurfacing as its triple surface treatment is unravelling due to poor exe-
cution by force account.   The remaining 83 km of paved roads are city
streets, most of them located in Djibouti City.   The unpaved network of
about 2,500 km comprises ill-defined earth roads and tracks, most of which
are in poor condition and passable only by four-wheel drive vehicles.  The
extent of the network is adequate for the low level of economic activity
outside Djibouti City, but its present condition means that much of the
country's hinterland is virtually inaccessible to its economic and adminis-
trative center.

and Alyemda (Aden) Airways.



-4-
1.11       As roads were not classified, the Government issued a decree on
June  2,  1982  classifying  the network  and  identifying  a National  Road
Network of about 1,100 km including the 300 km of paved roads and streets
and about 800 km of priority earth roads and tracks to be targeted for
improvement and regular maintenance.
(ii) Road Use
Vehicle Fleet and Traffic
1.12      The vehicle fleet in 1980 totalled about 6,700 or 21 vehicles per
1,000 inhabitants which is above average for Eastern Africa.   This high
fleet per capita ratio is due to the relatively large expatriate population
living in Djibouti. The fleet, currently composed of about 4,800 cars and
light vehicles, 1,600 small trucks and four-wheel-drive vehicles aild 300
heavy trucks, has been growing at about 8% p.a. since 1978 the first year
statistics were compiled on vehicle ownership.  During the same perior., the
number of heavy trucks has actually dec:Lined by about 2% p.a. as light
trucks and four-wheel drive vehicles have taken their place on the in(4raas--
ingly difficult earth road network.
1.13        No systematic traffic counts have been carried out in Djibouti.
but consultants' counts in 1981, as part of a highway maintenance study,
show that overall traffic volumes are low.  The roads around Djibouti City
have the highest traffic volumes, up to 400 vpd on the outskirts of the
city; earth roads and tracks carry volumes up to 20 vpd.
1.14       Imports of gasoline and diesel fuel increased by some 12% p.a.
from 1978 to 1981 compared to the 8% annual increase in the vehicle fLeet.
During that period, gasoline consumption increased by 18% while diesel fuel
consumpition increased by 46%, the latter influenced by the low price of
diesel fuel, only 40% of that of gasoline.
Fuel Prices & Taxes
(US$ per litre)
CIF    Handling    Tax  Pump Price   Difference
Premium Gasoline          0.28     0.14      0.20      0.71          O.C9
Regular Gasoline          0.28     0.12      0.20      0.63          0A.3
Diesel Fuel               0.29     0.08      0.10      0.29         -0.18
As can be seen from the above table, gasoline consumers have been sub-idi-
zing diesel users.  The Government adopted this policy in an effort to sub-
sidize public passenger transport and the movement of goods to outlyLng
areas. However, this has resulted in an unusually high increase in the :im-
portation of diesel vehicles (both cars and trucks) for use also by seg-
ments of the population other than the above target group. To remedy this
situation the Government has introduced an annual tax on diesel-powerec. ie-
hicles not  qualifying  for subsidies.   The tax varies from US$86.00 to
US$514.00 depending on the vehicle's horsepower. This new tax is, however,



- 5 -
not high enough to fully offset the price subsidy on diesel fuel.   One
possible solution to this problem would be to raise the price of diesel
fuel and provide a direct subsidy to for-hire passenger and goods trans-
port. However this is likely to be met with considerable resistance from
Government due partly to the sheer administrative problems involved. A se-
cond alternative would be to further increase the annual tax designed to
recapture the diesel advantage from those who do not qualify for the subsi-
dy. This special tax could be phased out over time as the price of diesel
is gradually increased.   The Association's viewpoints on this issue were
made known to the Government at negotiations and will form part of its on-
going dialogue with the Government.
(iii) The Road Transport
1.15       Passenger transport is provided by owner-operated small vehicles
or mini-buses for trips outside  the city.   Freight  is also handled by
owner-operators using trucks with a maximum carrying capacity of 6 tons.
Only a few operators have more than one truck. About 80% of all trips have
origin and destination within 25 km of Djibouti City. There are no statis-
tics on volumes of freight or passenger transport operations.
1.16       Passenger fares, which are set by the Government, are revised
from time to time to reflect inflation.  Freight tariffs are free of con-
trol. Entry into the road transport industry is subject to a license ob-
tainable at a nominal fee, and no restrictions are imposed as to route and
type of freight to be carried; competition, therefore, is keen.  There are
as of yet no laws governing axle load limits and none is necessary since
the very poor state of roads and the low freight volumes automatically li-
mit axle loads. This state of affairs is unlikely to change soon.
(iv) Administration, Staffing and Training
1.17       Responsibility for administration of the country's roads is ill-
defined.  In principle, the Public Works Department (PWD) of the Ministry
of Public Works, Urban Affairs and Housing (MPW) is in charge of construc-
tion and maintenance of the streets of Djibouti City and the 217 km paved
road from Djibouti City to the Ethiopian border; municipalities are respon-
sible for the maintenance of their streets (other than Djibouti City) which
are designed and constructed under the responsibility of the PWD; and the
Ministry of the Interior (MI) is in principle responsible for the mainte-
nance of most tracks.   However,  as the municipalities and MI lack the
funds, expertise and equipment to carry out these tasks, PWD is regularly
called upon to provide these services on an emergency basis.  By a decree
of June 1982, the Government gave MPW responsibility for maintaining and
improving the National Road Network, including the streets of Djibouti
City.  For proper implementation of this decree, the Government has pre-
pared an organizational decree for MPW, which is satisfactory to the Asso-
ciation. A condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit will be that
the Government has issued this decree and has sent a copy to the
Association.

ROADS
1.18          PWD is run by about 26 expatriates provided by FAC; 11 are
assigned to the Road Division.  Many are themselves young trainees.  Ilere
are about 400 Djiboutians in PWD; 200 are in the Road Division, includinîg 4
engineers, 26 technicians and 170 mechanics, operators, drivers and labor-
ers.  Those at the level of engineer and technician are mostly young and
inexperienced. About 60% of the entire local staff of the Road Division is
illliterate, most of whom are approaching retirement age.  Recruitmelit of
qualified staff and training are therefore  high priority areas for F'WD.
The Ministry of Interior has a work force of about 1,200 laborers supposed-
ly assigned to the maintenance of tracks but producing very little; 5Kf0 of
these would be transferred to PWD when its reorganization is effective,
1.19     All of the PWD's engineers and technicians were trained in ntigh-
boring countries and France; the Djibouti school system only offers la,ic
training up to the high school level.  A study being financed by F/,C is
assessing the country's training needs in the technical field, incltudLng
public works.  The study, expected to result in a project to improve train-
ing facilities and training of personnel, may also be financed by FAC.  'he
proposedl project would assist the training effort through on-the-job tra::n-
ing of young Djiboutian engineers, technicians and operators and thiough
overseas fellowships; for staff (para. 2.07).
(v)  Engineering, Construction and Maintenance
1.20        PWD has overall responsibility for road feasibility studies,
final engineering and construction supervision.  Djibouti follows the s:an-
dards of road design developed by the French Ministry of Equipment. Feasi-
bility studies, final engineering and construction supervision are ex:,lu-
sively carried out by foreign consultants as PWD lacks the capacity and
there are no domestic consulting firms.  The Government intends to dev,lop



- 7 -
an in-house capacity to identify projects and closely follow their prepara-
tion and execution.  To support this effort, FAC is improving the Govern-
ment Soils Laboratory by providing technical assistance, local staff train-
ing and laboratory equipment. Once strengthened,the Soils Laboratory would
participate in all soils and materials studies for civil works. Experience
in other francophone countries with similar arrangements has been good.
1.21          PWD carries out some spot improvements,  limited resurfacing
works and routine maintenance operations by force account. The quality of
its work is generally low due to poorly maintained equipment, lack of com-
petent personnel and improper work organization.   The proposed project
would initiate proper road improvement and maintenance operations (para.
2.03).   PWD operates an aggregate crushing plant and an asphalt emulsion
plant.   FAC experts are helping improve the operation of both plants.
Major construction of roads and buildings is carried out by foreign con-
tractors. The domestic construction industry consists of medium- to small-
sized firms primarily engaged in the housing subsector as subcontractors to
foreign contractors.  It is expected that they will continue to play this
role in the construction of workshops under the proposed project.
D. Transport Planning and Financing
1.22           Responsibility for overall planning rests with the Central
Planning Directorate located in the Presidency.   Since independence, the
Government has not prepared an overall economic plan.   The Bank Group's
first credit to Djibouti (approved by the Board on April 20, 1982) is for
technical assistance to help develop a project evaluation capacity and
prepare such a plan. No effective transport planning capability exists in
either the Ministry of Commerce, Tourism and Transport or the Ministry of
Public Works and none is necessary,given the relatively simple state of and
issues in the transport sector. The Government intends instead to develop
a transport planning and coordination capability in the Central Planning
Directorate which would be the best utilization of scarce qualified staff.
1.23       The Government has met the financial requirements of the rela-
tively small road construction and maintenance works performed through
road-user charges.  Expenditures on roads over the past three years have
averaged US$2.7 million p.a. or about 2% of the total government expendi-
tures; this amount is sufficient (Annex 1).  The Goverament has agreed to
maintain expenditures for roads at this level, in constant 1982 prices, for
1983-85.  Users contributed about US$5.5 million in road user charges in
1981 which is more than adequate to meet road maintenance requirements in-
cluding the incremental work envisaged under the project.  In addition, the
Government receives assistance from France in the highway subsector in the
form of technical assistance personnel to the Ministry of Public Works for
highway administration.   Potential cofinancing agencies in the transport
sector include the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the
Saudi Fund.

E. Road Development Policy
1.24        At independence, Djibouti inherited a relatively efficient pcûrt
and railway system and an excellent airport.   Part of government's pol:Icy
is to make Djibouti a regional transshipment point by taking advantage of
its geographic location and its relatively good transport facilities; tl.is
policy is sound. But, as the country's population was concentrated in ths
capital city, roads to the hinterland had been neglected, leaving parts of
the country virtually cut off from its economic nucleus.  The Governments'
policy for road deve'Lopment has been to improve connections in order to
supply outposts and urnify the country.  So far these improvements have been
modest, in line with the low traffic levels.  More recently several doncr,
have been approached to help finance upgrading of selected roads which have
been designated by Government as high priority, and the risk of large-sca[le
miisinvestment now appears on the horizon.  For example, among the project;
under consideration for financing by Arab funds is the construction of the
road linking Djibouti to Tadjourah (125 km).  While the economic feasit,i-
lity of the project, expected to cost over US$60.0 million at its curre!nl:
design standards, is uincertain, the Government intends to push ahead witl
it since it would be lthe only road link to the economically and physically
isolated northern half of the country.   Under similar situations in scne
countries in Western Africa, experience has shown that the Bank's mcst:
effective role is to assist governments in adopting economic and technical--
ly sound design standaLrds rather than persuade them to abandon the projezt
altogether.   This role was initiated during discussions at negotiations.
As an additional safeguard, the Government has agreed to consult from tilne
to time with the Association on the Government's highway subsector poliîy
and investments and inform the Association of its policy and investments Lr
the transport sector.

Il.  THE PROJECT
A.  Objectives
2.01        Until Djibouti's independence in 1977, the development of the
road network was neglected in favor of other modes of transportation, vir-
tually cutting off the poor pastoral population from the country's economic
nucleus - Djibouti City. The Government has begun concentrating efforts on
the development of the road network in order to serve outposts and unify
the country.   The proposed project, the first Association involvement in
Djibouti's transport sector, is aimed at assisting the Government in
strengthening its road organization to carry out effective, economic and
efficient road improvement and maintenance operations thereby (i) providing
easier and more reliable access to the hinterland and (ii) reducing trans-
port costs.  The project is also aimed at training local staff and laying
the foundation for planning and preparing future road projects.
B. Project Description
2.02      The proposed project includes the following:
(a)  a three-year road improvement and maintenance program including
resurfacing of about 25 km of paved roads, routine maintenance on
the 300 km of paved roads and streets, and spot improvements and
maintenance with hand tools on about 800 km of priority earth
roads and tracks;
(b)  improvement of equipment maintenance facilities, including con-
struction of workshops in Djibouti City and service stations in
Tadjourah and Dikhil; and
(c)  consulting services comprising technical assistance to strengthen
the road organization, train personnel and to prepare preinvest-
ment studies to identify the improvement needs and priorities of
the road network, and fellowships for the training of road main-
tenance personnel.
(a) Road Improvement and Maintenance Program
2.03       PWD's routine maintenance brigade for the 300 km of paved roads
and streets works with obsolete equipment and poorly trained personnel.
Its resurfacing brigade is relatively well-equipped but lacks field
experience. Spot improvements and emergency maintenance on the earth roads
and tracks are carried out by a mobile brigade whose staff also needs
practical experience. Teams of laborers of the MI, nominally in charge of
routine maintenance of earth roads and tracks, produce no tangible re-
sults.   The proposed project would initiate appropriate road improvement
and maintenance operations on the National Road Network of about 1,100 km
of priority roads, including the 300 km of paved roads and about 800 km of
earth roads and tracks. The specific works included in the three-year pro-
gram would be:



- 10-
(a)  patching and resealing of the 300 km of paved roads;
(b)  resurfacing of the 25-km section  (Grand Bara) of the Djibou-:i-
Ethiopia border road (para. 1.10); and
(c) spot improvements and routine maintenance on the 800 km of earth
roads and tracks.
The project will provide the equipment, spare parts, tools, materials and
supplies for these works.  The list of these items (Annex 2) were agreed
upon at negotiations.
(b) Workshops
2.04       PWD's equipment is poorly maintained because its workshop facili-
ties are too small and obsolete.  The small workshop in Djibouti City is
practically the only facility in the country for maintaining road eqiip-
ment. Built before independence to handle light vehicles, it is locateil on
a crowded site, and lacks the necessary equipment and tools to effect pro-
per and efficient maintenance of existing road equipment let alone eq,tip-
ment to be procured under the proposed project (para.2.03).   A new :;ite
would be provided by the Government for the construction of a central work-
shop in Djibouti City.   The proposed project will provide for improving
sites and services, building and equipping the workshop. The project lrill
also provide for the expansion of a small service station recently l on-
structed in Tadjourah for minor repairs of trucks and light vehicles to
enable it to accomodate road equipment.  A new shed would also be buili: in
Tadjourah and additional equipment and tools provided to the existing v er-
vice station under the project.  Finally, new facilities would be buili: lt
Dikhil, including a shed and a service station, and provided with workshop
equipment and tools.   The Government will acquire the necessary land for
these facilities by July 1, 1983.  The equipment list (Annex 2) has bee!n
agreed upon.
(c) Consulting Services and Training
2.05        Since PWD is already benefitting from technical assistance from
FAC (para. 1.18), the proposed project would provide only the additio la.1
experts necessary to carry out specific and urgent tasks: init;Lating proJE?r
road maintenance operations and carrying out resurfacing works, and runnLr.g
the workshops, service stations and sheds.  These experts would supplemeir.t
the assistance already in place and therefore would serve for a relatively
short duration.  The project would provide for the services of (i) a road
engineer (12 man-months) to assist in road maintenance; (ii) a mechanil al
engineer with expertise in procurement and warehousing (36 man-months);  nrd
(iii) a road engineer with expertise in performance accounting (36 man-
months) to (a) introduce proper accounting procedures in the operations of
the workshops and road works and (b) establïsh unit costs of these opera-
tions.  A workshop manager, provided by FAC, is already in the field; IAC
would also provide  on1 a parallel basis a master mechanic.   It has bg en
agreed that the expert master mechanic will arrive in Djibouti by July 1,
1983.



- il-
2.06      Consulting services would be provided to prepare engineering stu-
dies for the improvement of about 250 km of tracks to improved earth/gravel
road standards.  The improvement works are expected to be financed outside
the project by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development which has
expressed to the Government its willingness to finance the works starting
in FY1984.  The project also provides for consulting services for prein-
vestment studies for the rehabilitation of the first section (30 km) of the
paved road from Djibouti City to the Ethiopian border.  This road section,
which carries the heaviest traffic in Djibouti, was built 30 years ago and
maintenance operations can no longer effectively arrest the accelerating
deterioration of the pavement. ConsuLtants services would also be provided
to assist the Government in preparing detailed engineering and bidding do-
cuments, and supervision of works for the construction of workshops. Terms
of reference (Annexes 3 & 4) for all consultants and technical assistance
experts to be engaged under the project were discussed and agreed upon
during negotiations.
2.07       The proposed project will address PWD's training needs in two
ways: counterparts, includiLng engineers, workshop mechanics, road techni-
cians, store keepers and accountants will be attached to all consultants
and technical experts who will be expected to provide them with on-the-job
training.  Their terms of reference specifically includes this.  The pro-
ject would also provide fellowships for eight instructors who will train
equipment operators and road technicians.   In addition,  FAC has hired
experts who are carrying out a study to assess the country's training needs
in technical fields including public works and to determine how to improve
its training facilities to meet these needs.   The Government has agreed
to exchange views with IDA on its proposals and to provide the Association
with a copy of this report upon its completion.  At the conclusion of this
study, the Government may request IDA and FAC financing for an important
program to improve training facilities, including provision of equipment
and training personnel.
C. Project Cost Estimates and Financing
2.08      The total project cost, net of taxes and duties, is estimated at
US$8.0 million equivalent with local costs of about US$1.6 million equiva-
lent (20%) and foreign costs of about US$6.4 million (80%). The Government
has stated that it will exempt the project from taxes and duties estimated
at US$2.4 million equivalent. Project costs (as of June 1982), net of tax-
es, are detailed in Annex 5, and summarized below:

supplies iare based oni recent bid prices and quotations in Djibouti.   ;'he
costs of civil works are in line with the costs of recent and ongoing simii-
lar works in the country.  The man-month costs of technical assistance i..ni
consulting services of: US$9,600 are estimated as follows: US$6,300 for îa-
laries and overheads (home office expenses, expatriate allowa:nces, soclIal
costs and other indirect expenditures) and US$3,300 for reimbursable exp(.n-
ses (travel, telecommunication, subsistence and other miscellaneous item.).
The costs of fellowships are estimated at US$10,000 per student per ytzar
including tuition and fees, housing, travel and subsistence.



- 13-
2.10       IDA Credit would cover the total foreign cost of the project or
US$6.4 million equivalent and would finance part of civil works, the total
cost of equipment, spare parts, consultant services and fellowships, and
the costs of materials and supplies excluding aggregates.  The Government
would provide the local costs or US$1.6 million equivalent to cover
salaries (US$0.6 million) of local personnel directly involved in the
improvement works, part of civil works (US$0.9 million) and the costs of
aggregates (US$0.1 million). The Government would contribute an additional
US$1.0 million for salaries of personnel involved in routine maintenance of
the targeted road network and would also be responsible for the acquisition
of land for the construction of workshops.
D. Project Implementation and Procureiment
2.11      The Ministry of Public Works, through its Public Works Department
and with the assistance of consultants, would be responsible for project
implementation.

2.12        The foregoing implementation schedule for major activities of
each project element was discussed and agreed upon at negotiations.   The
project would be implemented over about three years starting the second
quarter of calendar year 1983.  Road maintenance equipment, materials and
supplies would be delivered by June 1984, about six months after notifica-
tion of contracts  to the suppliers.   Spot improvement and maintenance
operations would be carried out on the national road network for three
years starting April 1983. The preparation of bidding documents, procure-
ment procedures and construction of workshops would take about 21 months to
complete, starting in April 1983.  The preinvestment studies should start
in April 1983 and take about 15 months to complete includîng a three-month
review period by the Government and IDA.
2.13       The spot improvements and routine maintenance operations on the
National Road Network and resurfacing works would be carried out by force
account; PWD brigades would be provided with necessary additional equipment
and experienced personnel to satisfactorily carry out these tasks.   The
construction of workshops (US$2.09 million) would be executed by contract-
ors selected on the basis of international competitive bidding and in ac-
cordance with Bank Group Guidelines.   To provide domestic contractors an
opportunity to participate in the works, foreign contractors would be en-
couraged to make maximum possible use of domestic contractors including
subcontracting work and supplying construction materials.   Equipment and
spare parts (US$2.23 million) and materials and supplies (US$0.53 million)
would be procured on the basis of contracts following international compe-
titive biddfng in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines.  All items would
be bulked to the extent possible to make them attractive to international
manufacturers and dealers.  Aggregates (US$0.1 million) to be financed by
the Government would be acquired from PWD's own crushing plant. Consulting
services (US$1.53 million) would be provided by consulting firms on terms
and  conditions  satisfactory  to  the Association.    Fellowships  (US$0.08
million) would be awarded to 8 suitable PWD employees. Before awarding the
fellowships the Government would furnish to the Association for approval a
detailed program for training.   The program would include the names and
qualifications of the candidates, the type and cost of training as well as
the training institutions and an indication of assignments to be given to
the trainees on their retura to Djibouti.
2.14        Government's procurement procedures date from pre-independence
and are written in such a way that they allow complete discretion to
Government in awarding contracts: the lowest evaluated bidder need not be
selected and the whole bid evaluation procedure and bid opening are carried
out secretly.   These bidding procedures and their deviation from those
acceptable to the Bank were discussed with the Government which indicated
that it would be writing a new procurement code but that for Bank Group
projects, it would comply with ICB. Agreement to this effect was confirmed
by Government during negotiations.  Moreover, because of the Government's
lack of familiarity with Bank Group ICB procedures and its implications as
a departure from its current procedures, procurement procedures were also
discussed in detail during negotiations and will be carefully monitored
during project implementation.

E. Disbursements
2.15      The proposed IDA credit SDR 5.7 million (US$6.4 million) woul:l be
disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 70% of total contract expenditures net of taxes and duties for
the construction of workshops;
(b)  100% c.i.f. costs of equipment, spare parts, tools, materials and
supplies (excluding aggregates), or 90% of the costs if purch...ssd
locally; and
(c)  100% of expenditures net of taxes and duties for consulting ser-
vices and fellowships.
All disbursements would be fully documented.
2.16      The estimated schedule of disbursement from the credit account: is
shown below. Since this is one of the Association's first two projects :in
Djibouti, there is no disbursement profile. The schedule was estimated. by
the appraisal mission on the basis of the project implementation schedu'Le
and takes into consideration the fact that the Government is a new Borrcwer
to the Association.

- 17-
F. Accounting and Reporting Requirements
2.17      All payments under the investment and recurrent budgets are made
by the Treasurer upon presentation of invoices certified by the Ministry of
Public Works.  Separate accounts are kept for each project financed by ex-
ternal assistance.   Since the Ministry of Public Works does not have an
accounting system of its own, the project will provide an expert to in-
troduce proper accounting procedures for the operations of the workshops
and road works and establish unit costs of these operations (para. 2.05).
All project components will be executed under contracts and thus will allow
easy monitoring of expenditures. The use of materials, supplies and spare
parts will be monitored during project supervision according to performance
accounting procedures to be set up by the consultants under the project.
During negotiations, it was agreed that project accounts will be audited by
an independent auditor acceptable to the Association and the audited
account will be submitted to the Association by the Treasury not later than
six months after the end of each fiscal year during project implementation.
2.18      During negotiations, the Government and the Association agreed on
progress reporting requirements (Annex 6) which should include indices for
measuring implementation progress and submission of a project completion
report in a form satisfactory to the Association not later than six months
after the closing date of the Credit.
G. Environmental Impact
2.19       The project is not likely to have any adverse effect on the en-
vironment.  The project roads would follow the existing alignments, and no
disturbance to land use should occur.   Furthermore,  the new or improved
drainage facilities will benefit the adjacent areas.

III. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
3.01      The proposed project will help stop the rapid deterioration on a
25 km section of the paved road network, improve maintenance operations on
the whole paved network and establish an organization capable of uniler-
taking basic minimum maintenance on about 800 km of earth roads and tracks
on which, up to now, no effective maintenance has been carried out.   Ihe
objectives of the project aim at facilitating transport within and betieeen
regions of the country for goods and passengers and at reducing transport
costs. 'Fhe benefits from the project will arise from (i) protection of the
investment already made in the case of paved roads and (ii) improvement. of
earth roads and tracks through the establishment of a minimum level of rou-
tine maintenance on 800 km of priority roads identified by Government and
consultants.
3.02      The benefits arising from the improved maintenance operations are
only estimates and must be considered approximate in view of the lack  f
reliable data on cosl:s, traffic and economic parameters in Djibouti. Bene-
fits froai workshops and technical assistance are even more difficult to es-
timate but are expected to be substantial.  No separate rate of return has
been calculated for them. However without them project implementaton wciuLd
be a failure; their costs have been added to other project costs when es,tL-
mating rate of return of the project as a whole.
3.03      Benefits from the project execution would be shared 'y owners and
operators of vehicles and passengers riding in these vehicles.  Those peo-
ple living in areas only accessible by track would benefit from imprGVEed
access to health and social facilities and better and cheaper distribution
of food and supplies.  Because of the keen competition in the transport LrL-
dustry, savings in vehicle operating costs can be expected to be passed cn
to transport users.
B. Costs and Benefits
3.04      Traffic counts in Djibouti have not been carried out except foa- a
one week effort by consultants in 1981 on seLected roads and tracks.  Th:>se
counts show that on the paved road network traffic varies from about 60
v.p.d. to about 400 v.p.d. on the outskirts of Djibouti City.  Traffic on
earth roads and tracks is low, ranging from 5 to 20 v.p.d.  As no histori-
cal data exists on traffic volumes, and economic activity outside the city
is limited, the analysis assumes a conservative growth of 2.5% p.a. "or
traffic on paved roads and 1% p.a. for earth roads and tracks.  Costs of
improvement and maintenance have been estimated as outlined in para. 2.(19.
Vehicle operating costs and savings were derived by consultants using th2
Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM) using typical rca,1
conditions in Djiboutî and were found reasonable.



- 19-
3.05       The resurfacing of a 25 km section of the paved road which cros-
ses the Grand Bara will arrest the rapid deterioration of this section.
While the present traffic level is low, about 60 v.p.d., it is estimated
that this section would revert to gravel standard in about three years and
would have to be reconstructed if the proposed works were not undertaken.
Benefits would be reductions in vehicle operating costs which have been
assumed to increase as a function of time to reflect the rapidly
deteriorating road section.  Also included as a benefit is the savings in
reconstruction  cost  which  would  be  required  in  5  years.    Economic
evaluation shows that the resurfacing component would be well justified
with an ERR of 58% based on an economic life of 5 years (Annex 7).
3.06       The maintenance program consists of routine maintenance on about
300 km of paved roads and streets and 800 km of tracks and earth roads.
The works would concentrate on reducing the amount of potholing and edge
ravelling on paved roads and repairing of drainage works and minor road
works on the earth and gravel roads. Average traffic flows of 60 v.p.d. on
the paved roads and 5 v.p.d. on other roads have been assumed.   As the
works are to be repeated each year for the three year project execution
period, the economic life is limited to that same period. Based on these
assumptions, this project component would yield average economic return in
excess of 100% for both paved and earth roads (Annex 7).  The maintenance
program would be well justified.
C . Conclusions
3.07        Overall economic evaluation incorporating costs of workshops,
equipment and technical assistance components, shows implementation of all
project components is well justified and appropriately timed.  The overall
project rate of return is estimated to be greater than 100%.  Because of
the very high rates of return for each of the components, no sensitivity
analysis has been carried out.
3.08      The principal risks of the project are the usual risks associated
with road maintenance projects compounded by the fact that this is the
first IDA operation in the road subsector.  There may be delays in imple-
mentation linked with procurement of equipment materials and supplies, re-
cruitment of technical assistants, construction of workshops and provision
of local financing, which could slow down the maintenance effort with con-
sequent reductions in benefits; in addition productivity could be lower
than even the modest levels assumed.  To reduce these risks, the project
includes technical assistance responsible for specific project components.
Since the project will be the first Association involvement in the highway
sector, more frequent supervision will also be required in the initial pro-
ject stages.

HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
Draft Terns of Reference for Preinvestuent Studies
INTRODUCTION
1.         The Ministry of Public Works intends to rehabilitate the first
30 km (Djibouti - Arta) of the paved road from Djibouti City to the Ethio-
pian border, and improve about 250 kml/ of priority tracks.   The paved
road section, which carries the heaviest traffic in Djibouti, was built 30
years ago and maintenance operations can no longer effectively arrest the
accelerating deterioration of the pavement.   The 250 km of tracks are in
poor condition and passable ouly by four-wheel drive vehicles; this traffic
is interrupted during the short but intense rainy season.  The Government
will need the services of experienced consultants, about 12 man-months for
the 30 km and 24 man-months for the 250 km, to carry out the preinvestment
studies of these roads.
Objectives
2.        The objectives of the studies are:
(i) to define on the basis of technical and economic criteria the op-
timum level of improvement to be afforded these roads;
(ii) to prepare the final engineering for the execution of works de-
fined on the basis of the studies under (i) above; and bidding
documents only for the 30 km paved road; and
(iii) to train PWD personnel in so doing.
Scope of Consultants Services
A.   Djibouti-Arta Road (30 km)
3.         The studies will be executed in two phases by a team of experts
who will be required to include personnel of the Public Works Department as
trainees.
Feasibility Study
4.         The objective of the feasibility study is to define the optimum
economic solution for the improvement of the road section. The choice will
be based on a comparison of alternatives and the optimum solution will be
based primarily on:
(i) determination of the scope of the resurfacing and/or reconstruc-
tion to be undertaken;
(ii) the technical characteristics to be given to the road sections;
and
(iii) the cost of executing the works.
_/ Defined at negotiations



- 28 -
Annex 4
Page 2 of 4
5.        The feasibility study will include:
(a)  Traffic Studies.  Traffic counts and load distribution should be
carried out on the road section.   The following vehicle lypes
should be used: heavy trucks (greater than 5t load) and biusas,
light trucks, vans and Land Rovers, and cars.  Forecasts of traf-
f ic shall be established for each five-year period during i:he
economic life of the proposed investments.  The forecasts slould
be established with the help of origin-destination surveys of ty-
pical users of the existing corridors.
(b) Study of road transport costs. For each technical solution zon-
sidered, the operating costs for each type of vehicle as well as
its evolution during the economic life of the investment will be
studied.  The costs of routine and periodic maintenance wil  be
included, as well as the costs of resurfacing and/or reconstruc-
tion. The interrelationship between traffie, the vehicle operat-
ing costs, maintenance costs and the cost of reconstruction ahill
be considered.
(c)  Technical investigations.   Consultants should undertake all :per-
tinent topographic, soils, and hydrological surveys and tesi:î-Ig
of the performance of the existing pavement to determine naw
technical characteristics of the road sections.   All drairage
structures to be repaired or reconstructed will also be exami.ned
and the necessary works defined. The documents necessary for the
execution of these works will be prepared, including investiga-
tions for foundation studies and hydrological surveys for dra.in-
age works. The consultants should also study with special attein-
tion the miaLterials best adapted for the construction of the saib-
grade, sub-base, the base and wearing courses. They should id'tL-
tify and carefully evaluate the quality and quantity of materils
of the borrow pits and rock quarries within economical haulir.g
distance of the road.  They should also, if necessary, carry ott
soils surveys and identify quarries and borrow pits for road
maintenance in the road zone.
(d)  Economic comparison of the solutions examined.   To define  :he
economically most advantageous solution, a comparison will be
made of the total transport costs on the road (including all 'e-
hicle operating costs) for the economic life of the proposed Ln-
vestment, as well as the costs of investments and maintena;ce
associated with the different solutions considered.  The compa-i-
son is to determine the optimum technical characteristics as will
as the timing of the investment.  Normal, generated and divert:ed
(if foreseen) traffic will be separately identified. Other beve-
fits  to be quantified are:  the economic savings due to tire-
savings for the transport of high-value goods, and reduction li
spoilage of perishable goods.



- 29 -
Annex 4
Page 3 of 4
6.         The various solutions will be compared to a reference solution,
which is defined as the continued use of the existing road, on its present
alignment, without major investments and with maintenance as required. The
economie rate of return and the net present value using a 12% discount rate
will be determined for each solution, as well as the first-year return
(comparison of costs to benefits the first year after completion).  A sen-
sitivity analysis will be performed to account for uncertainty in any of
the cost and benefit parameters entering into the calculation.  Any possi-
ble interdependence among the variables should be considered.
7.         The costs to be taken into account are economic costs, i.e. net
of taxes and adjusted to reflect the scarcity or surplus of the resource.
Detailed Engineering and Bidding Documents
8.         This step will include the preparation of detailed engineering,
cost estimates and bidding documents for the works selected by the Govern-
ment on the basis of the feasibility studies' recommendations. It will in-
clude the final detailed topographic surveys and geotechnical studies to
complement the work done during feasibility studies.
9.        The bidding documents will be prepared for international competi-
tive bidding with prequalification of contractors, in accordance with the
Guidelines Concerning Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits.
The consultants will recommend the grouping of the contract works according
to the directives of the Government.
10.       As soon as the necessary elements for the detailed definition of
the works are shown, the consultants will prepare a prequalification
dossier.  It will include an invitation to apply for prequalification as
well as a brief descriptive notice on the nature of the works. The consul-
tants will also prepare the newspaper publicity and the circulars for in-
forming the embassies of Bank member countries and Switzerland.
il.       The bidding documents shall include:
(a) all sections necessary for staking the road works including cross
sections  and grades and for construction of  sub-grades,  base
course, ditches, s1noulders and the pavement, as well as for all
drainage structures and the associated equipment fitting;
(b) the general conditions of contract, especially concerning the
rules about performance bond, price adjustment, insurance to be
provided and advance payments;
(c) the special conditions of contract, including the technical spe-
cifications of the construction methods and materials and the
control and measurements procedures;

(d) schedule of unit prices; and
(e) the quantity estimates.
12.           Consultants should also prepare a confidential report whLch
should comprise the detailed cost estimate, broken down into foreign cos :s,
local costs and taxes.  The foreîgn cost will include, in particular, l:he
following: depreciation of imported equipment, imported materials and sup-
plies, salaries and benefits for expatriate personnel, overheads and pro-
fits of the contractor, as well as the main foreign exchange cost of goods
produced in Djibouti which are used in the project.
B.   250 km of Tracks
13.        The studies will be executed in two phases by a team of experts
who will be required to include personnel of the Public Works Department as
trainees.  Traffic on these tracks varies from 5 to 20 four-wheel vehicles
a day; as their improvement cannot be economically justified beyond the
level of a basic earth road, the tracks will be improved to RTS2/ stan-
dards.  The two phases of studies will thus include a preliminary engineer-
ing phase and a detailed engineering phase.
Preliminary Engineering
14.        Consultants should undertake direct location topographic surveys
of the alignments and suggest alternative improvements of sharp curves ai d
difficult deep valleys and mountainous crossings.  They should also cari:y
out appropriate soils and hydrological surveys and prepare various alterna-
tives of miinor alignment improvements, grades and basic drainage struc-
tures.  They will estimate the costs of the various alternatives and state
their benefits both quantifiable and unquantifiable.  They will prepare a
preliminary engineering report including their recommendations.
Detailed Engineering
15.         After the preliminary engineering report has been reviewed and1
the level of improvements agreed upon between the Government and IDA, th~!
consultants will carry out the detailed engineering for the execution oai
these improvements and estimate their costs. Upon completion of f ield ant
office works, the consultants will prepare a draft final engineering repor:
including construction specifications. This report will be reviewed by the
Government aLnd IDA and a final report will be issued by the consultants.
16.        The improvement works are expected to be carried out by PWD bri-
gades.  These brigades are expected to be f inanced  (equipment and person-
nel) outside the proposed project by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development which  has   expressed  to  the  Government its  willingness  tc
finance the works starting in FY84.

IIIGIIWAY MAITENCE PROJECT
Project Reporting Requirements
A.   Project Progress Reports
l.         The borrower will prepare Progress Reports that should be sub-
mitted semi-annually in triplicate, no later than one calendar month after
the end of each six-month period.  Tle first report should cover the haLf-
year period ending December 31, 1983.
2.        The information that Progress Reports should contain is descri)ed
below:
(a)  General Information: This should include the following:
(i)  the  physical  progress  accomplished  during  the  reportt.ng
period;
(ii) actual or expected deviations from the project implementa-
tion schedule;
(iii)  actual or expected difficulties or delays and their effee:ts
on the implementation schedule, and the steps planned or
taken to overcome the difficulties and avoid further delav;
(iv)  expecte,d changes in the completion date of the project;
(v) key personnel changes in the staff of the admïnistraticln,
consultants or contractor;
(vi)  matters which may affect the cost of the project;; and
(vii)  any development activity likely to affect the ecQnomic vil-
bility of project components.
(b)  A bar-type progress chart, based on the project implementati,)r.
scheduled should show the progress in each project component.
(c)  A financial statement should be set out in the tabular form and
indicate for each project component:
(1) original estimated cost;
(ii) revised cost, if appropriate;
(Iii) actual expenditure;

Annex 6
Page 2 of 3
(iv) projected expenditure; and
(v) actual and projected withdrawals from the Credit Account.
(d) Finally, Progress Reports should state the status of action on
each covenant of the Credit Agreement.
3.        Progress Reports will be an important input in the preparation of
the Project Completion Report.
B.   Project Completion Report
4.        The borrower will prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR) to be
submitted to the Association not later than six (6) months after the Clos-
inlg Date.
5.         The primary objective of the PCR is to reinforce self-evaluation
by the borrower and the Association's operating departments and to facili-
tate dissemination of lessons learned through the project:
(a) the performance by the borrower and the Association of their res-
pective obligations under the Credit Agreement and whether the
Association could have been more helpful;
<b) the results that can be expected from the project, as compared
with expectations at appr3isal, and whether the original expecta-
tions were realistic; and
(c)  whether ln retrospect the project was worth doing or could have
been done better.
6.         For those components of the project for which a rate of return
was estimated during. appraisal, the PCR should contain a new estimate of
the return the project is now likely to yield and analyze the reasons for
physical or economic deviations. However, the new rate of return calcula-
tions should be as simple as possible under the circuimstances 'and should
absorb only a minor portion of the time devoted to the preparation of the
PCR.   An annex with  the relevant  information  supporting  this analysis
should be included.
7.        The basic documents to be referred to are:
Credit Application
Feasibllity studies, Preappraisal Report, Project Brief
Appraisal Report
Credit Agreement documents, supplementary letters, etc.
Supervision Reports
Semi-annual Progress Reports
Project Correspondence Files
Miscellaneous Evaluation Reports.

8.          The Highway Division, Eastern Africa Projects Departmnents, vill
review and comment on the PCR in consultation with the Programs Depart-
ment. After approval by the Hlighway Division Chief, the PCR is sent ti) the
Bank Group's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) which is responl;ible
for conducting an audit of the project subsequent to the PCR exer:,ise.
Tlis audit can lead to suggestions for changes or additions in the P(R as
OEL prepares the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) for submissicn to
the Bank Group's Board of Directors.   Before going to the Board, the draft
PPAR, which includes the PCR, is sent to various Bank Group divisions, to
the Covernment, and occasionally to consultants.
