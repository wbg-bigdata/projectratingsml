DEFINITIONS
Crude Birth Rate:      Number of live births per year per 1,000 population.
Crude Death Rate:      Number of deaths per year per 1,000 population.
Rate of Natural        Difference between crude birth and crude death rates;
Increase:            usually expressed as a percentage.
Rate of Population    Rate of natural increase adjusted for (net) migration,
Growth:              and expressed as a percentage of the total population
in a given year.
Age-Specific           Number of live births to women in a given age group
Fertility Rates:    per 1,000 women in the same age group, in a given year.
It is usually calculated for 5-year age groups.
Total Fertility        The average number of children that would be born
Rate:                per women if she were to live to the end of her
childbearing years, and bear children according to
a given set of age-specific fertility rates. The
Total Fertility Rate often serves as an estimate of
the average number of children per family.
Gross Reproduction    This is the same as the Total Fertility Rate, but
Rate:                refers to the number of daughters a women would have
under prevailing fertility patterns.
Net Reproduction       The number of daughters a woman would have under
Rate:                prevailing fertility and mortality patterns, who
would survive to the mean age of childberaring.
Infant Mortality       Annual number of deaths of infants under 1 year
Rate:                per 1,000 live births during the same year.
Maternal Mortality    Number of maternal deaths per 1,000 births attri-
Rate:                butable to pregnancy, childbirth, or puerperal
complications (i.e., within six weeks following
childbirth).
Life Expectancy:       Average number of years expected to be lived by
children born in the same year if mortality rates
for each age/sex group remain the same in the
future.
Dependency Ratio:      Number of people 14 years and under plus people 65
years and over, divided by the population aged
15 to 64 years.

I. POPULATION GROWTH, HEALTH AND SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
A. Introduction
1.01      Rap-d population growth remains one of the most serious problems
facing the Philippines over the next two decades. This high level of popu-
lation growth affects all aspects of the economy of the Philippines, seriously
undermining the country's efforts to provide adequate levels of education,
housing, employment, food, and health care to its people. Although in recent
years there has been some decline in the average annual rate of population
growth, from 3% in the 1950s to 1960s, to 2.7% by 1975 and probably 2.5% by
1978, the potential for sustained high population growth rates remains great
because fertility levels are still high, the population is young and mortality
levels (particularly for those below age five) are expected to be reduced
further.
1.02      The decline in the crude birth rate during the 1970s was due
mainly to later age of marriage, an increase in non-marriage, and some
fertility decline in urban areas. In rural areas people still marry young
and few practice contraception. On the national average, total marital
fertility has remained almost unchanged between 1958 and the early 1970's
(around 9.6 children per married woman of reproductive age).
1.03      The crude death rate--the other factor determining population
growth--is still relatively high in the Philippines at 10.4 per 1000 in 1975.
High infant mortality contributes significantly to the high crude death rate,
since one-fourth of all deaths are those of children under one year. Those
children who survive their first year face a series of health threats, par-
ticularly from communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, gastroenteritis and
respiratory infections. Malnutrition has reached an alarmingly high level, as
about 78% of all the children surveyed in 1977 were shown to be malnourished.
1.04      High fertility contributes to existing health problems as a con-
sequence of large family size, insufficient spacing of pregnancies, low
standards of living, low nutrient intake, low productivity, and a continuously
increasing burden on the health services. It is therefore essential that the
Government's efforts to improve the health situation and to decrease morbidity
and mortality include increased actions to reduce fertility through public
education and the provision of family planning services. This concerted
effort to lower mortality, improve the health status of the population, and
reduce fertility is necessary to achieve the reduced rates of population
growth required for an improved quality of life and a better environment for
socioeconomic development.
B. Recent Demographic Trends
1.05      Seven censuses conducted between 1903 and 1975 show that the popula-
tion of the Philippines has increased more than fivefold--from 7.6 million in
1903, to 42.3 million in 1975 (trends in age distributions are presented in



- 2 -
Annex 12, T.1). Population growth rose to 3% per year during the 1960's, from
the almost constant 2% annual growth rate which prevailed since the early
1900's. The rate declined slightly to 2.7% per year in 1975. The following
table shows population and demographic rate trends during 1948-1975.

/2   Estimated for the period 1948-60.
Source:   National Census and Statistics Office, Census of the Philippines,
1903-1975.
1.06      Crude death rates declined steadily between 1948 and 1960.  However,
since the late 1960s mortality reduction has been less pronounced.  The
earlier mortality decline was mainly due to massive vector control programs
and socioeconomic improvements rather than widespread availability of modern
medical technology. The rough estimates of infant mortality available suggest
a decline over the period 1950 to 1965. However, analyses made between 1968
and 1973 show no evidence of continued decline in the more recent period.
This explains in part the slower decrease in total mortality in recent years,
since one fourth of all deaths are those of children under one year of age.
Further declines in total mortality and more so in infant mortality will
depend largely on improved, expanded and accessible health care services
emphasizing prevention, health education, lower fertility levels and better
nutrition.
1.07      Crude birth rates remained fairly constant until very recently,
hovering around the high level of 45 to 50 per 1,000 population through the
1950s and 1960s.  In 1975 the crude birth rate was estimated at 37 per 1000,
down from the 39 to 43 per 1000 estimated in 1970. Total marital fertility
was still very high and unchanged between 1958 and the early 1970s (around 9.6
children per married woman of reproductive age). The decline in the crude
birth rate during this period was due to a consistent trend toward later
marriage, an increase in non-marriage and some fertility decline in urban
areas, where family planning services have been available since the late
1960s. 1/ However, both age at marriage and contraceptive practice decrease
rapidly in relation to distance from urban areas.
1/   As no recent data are available on these factors, an analysis of their
relative effect upon the decline in the crude birth rate between 1972
and 1978 is not now possible.



1.08      Recognizing population growth and attendant socioeconomic pressures
as serious constraints in reaching medium and long-term development goals, in
1970 the Government adopted a national population policy which had as its
objective the reduction of the rate of growth of population to 1.6X and a
total population size of no more than 70 million by the year 2000. This
long-term goal, which was reaffirmed in the Five-Year Philippine Development
Plan 1978-82, 1/ implies the achievement of a net reproduction rate of one by
2000. The table below presents population projections made by the Government,
which would be necessary to reach the mentioned targets (projected age dis-
tributions are presented in Annex 12, T-2). These goals, while ambitious,
are achievable if program efforts already begun can be improved and sustained.

II. POPULATION AND HEALTH POLICIES AND ORGANIZATION
A. Population Program
Historical Overview of the Population Program
2.01      During the 1960s, family planning services were provided mostly by
private physicians, missionaries, and private clinics. In 1967 the President
of the Philippines, together with 17 other heads of state, signed the UN
Declaration of Population which recognized population growth as a major
consideration in long-range socioeconomic planning. In 1968, a small unit for
maternal and child health and family planning was created in the Department of
Health (recently re-named Ministry of Health-MOH).
2.02      In 1969 the Government created the Commission on Population (POPCOM)
as a planning, coordinating and policy-making body. It consisted of 22
members from the public and private sectors, with the University of the
Philippines' Population Institute as its secretariat. In 1970, acting upon
POPCOM's recommendations, the Government launched a national population
program which POPCOM was to coordinate and evaluate.
2.03      In 1972, POPCOM's functions were extended to include promoting family
planning education, coordinating relations with international organizations
concerned with population and ensuring that adequate family planning services
were made available to the public. At the same time, MOH was instructed to
provide family planning services through its health care delivery system.
The Ministry of Health in time became the principal source of family planning
services (by 1977 MOH was providing services to 64% of all family planning
acceptors in the country).
2.04      Since 1975, following a decision that family planning services
shiould increasingly be delivered by multi-purpose (non-health) field workers,
instead of mainly through clinics, POPCOM has organized three projects
designed primarily to provide family planning information, education, and
services, in rural areas where clinic services were limited or not available.
The first of these projects, the Total Integrated Development Approach
(TIDA), begun in 1975 with United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) financial assistance, was soon found to be too broad in its develop-
ment objectives and generally ineffective in motivating couples to practice
family planning. In 1976 POPCOM initiated Project Outreach (see para. 2.23),
also with USAID assistance, using TIDA's organizational structure and manpower.
2.05      The third project, Project Compassion, is implemented by the Popula-
tion Center Foundation (PCF)--a private organization which receives Government
funds. Project Compassion is similar to Project Outreach, but operates in six
provinces only. When, in 1977, Project Outreach was extended to the whole
country, problems of overlap arose, and POPCOM decided to designate PCF as
the "implementing agency" for Project Outreach in the six provinces where it
operates.



-5-
2.06      At the same time as Project Outreach was being established, MOH
continued the expansion of its basic health services, which included family
planning. In 1974, MOH introduced a program for retraining health personnel,
called the Restructured Health Care Delivery System (RHCDS), as part of the
first Bank-ass4sted population project (para 2.58). MOH has also established
mobile clinical services for family planning, particularly for sterilization
services, and extended the roles of nurses and midwives to include pill
dispensing and intrauterine device (IUD) insertion. 1/
2.07      In response to a downward trend in family planning acceptors and
in order to resolve the organizational, managerial and technical shortcomings
of the population program, in January 1977 the President of the Philippines
commissioned a comprehensive review of the program to a seven-member Special
Committee headed by the Commissioner on Government Reorganization.  In May
1978, the Government called a meeting of Government officials, population
experts, and external donors, to discuss the committee's draft report. The
final report, submitted to the President in November 1978, contains a sound
evaluation of policies and program activities and valuable recommendations
on POPCOM's organization and specific program strategy questions which have
mostly been accepted by the Government and are reflected in the program that
the proposed project would support. The President has instructed POPCOM and
the participating agencies to prepare a plan to implement the recommendations.
During negotiations the Government gave assurances that this population plan,
already partially completed, will be made available to the Association for its
review and comment by December 31, 1979 and, by March 31, 1980, the Government
will consult with the Association on a timetable for implementation of such
plan.
2.08      At the Consultative Group Meeting on Philippines held in Paris in
December 1978 the population situation in that country was discussed as a
special subject; at the meeting, the Government reported on the recommenda-
tions of the Special Committee and several donors, including the United
Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), USAID, and the Association,
presented their viewpoints concerning the strengths and weaknesses of the
Philippine population program and indicated the areas and levels of future
assistance.
National Goals and Strategies
2.09      The Five-Year Philippine Development Plan 1978-82 aims at reducing
the annual population growth rate from an estimated 2.5% in 1978 to 2.3% in
1982 and to 2.1% in 1987. The long-term goal is the attainment of a net
reproduction rate of one by 2000. The national population program is expected
to contribute significantly to the achievement of this goal. POPCOM has esti-
mated that, in order to reach these targets, it is necessary to: increase
the proportion of protected couples from 27% in 1978, to 40% in 1982 and 50%
in 1987; (b) increase contraceptive effectiveness from 86% in 1978 and to 90%
in 1982, by emphasizing more effective and lasting methods; and (c) improve
1/   This was authorized in 1972 through Presidential Decree No. 79, but
not put into practice until 1974.

follow-up services. Improvements in socioeconomic conditions, particularly in
health and nutrition, also are expected to help reduce fertility and mortality
and, probably with a time lag, to reduce population growth rates considerably.
POPCOM's Structure and Coordinating Role
2.10      In addition to its original coordinating and policy-making functions,
POPCOM now has several implementing functions, including the distribution of
contraceptives, the general supervision of Project Outreach, which is imple-
mented in the field by local governments, and the conduct of information,
education and communication (IEC) activities through its central, regional and
local staff.
2.11      POPCOM has two main components (see Organizational Charts in Annex 1,
C-1 and 2): the POPCOM Board and the Secretariat. The POPCOM Board consists
of ten members as follows: the Minister of Economic Planning (currently its
Chairman), the Ministers of Health, Education, Social Services, Local Govern-
ments, and Labor; the Dean of the University of the Philippines' Population
Institute; the Executive Director of the Population Center Foundation; and two
other representatives of the private sector. This composition is appropriate
to POPCOM's coordinating role, since the presence of the heads of agencies
represented in the Board ensures coordination.
2.12      Following a recommendation of the Special Committee, the POPCOM
Board has recently introduced a needed change in the structure of technical
committees that assist the review and approval of project proposals for the
population program. For several years POPCOM had four such committees for
service delivery, IEC, training, and research; this compartmentalization in
project review hindered coordination. The creation of one supervisory com-
mittee, which recommends appropriate actions on project proposals to the
Board, should improve coherence among program activities. Committee members
are selected from the Board, the Secretariat and other agencies as required.
Part of the membership is fixed and part changes according to the specialties
required for reviewing specific projects.
2.13      The POPCOM Secretariat has a central office in Manila with a staff
of about 200 persons, and 13 regional offices, each with a staff of about
30. The Secretariat is headed by an Executive Director, assisted by a Deputy
Director, and five associate directors. The headquarters staff has recently
been reorganized into seven divisions (see Annex 1, C-1). This represents
a substantial improvement over the past situation in which POPCOM staff was
regrouped from time to time to meet the needs of special projects (mostly
externally financed) into temporary units with functions that duplicated
those of the regular divisions and overlapped with one another.
2.14      Since its inception, POPCOM has had difficulties in gaining accept-
ance from the agencies it is supposed to coordinate. This is due in part to
managerial and technical weaknesses, aggravated in recent years by a high
turnover of professional staff; but it is also the result of a lack of clear
policy guidelines, overall plans and strategies, and weak support from higher
Government levels. A first important step to improve the situation is the
completion of the national population plan (para 2.07) that would guide the



- 7 -
full implementation of the recommendations of the Special Committee. Also,
there is a need to continue improving the staffing situation in POPCOM's
Secretariat through staff development and careful recruiting of any vacancies
which may occur from time to time. Some key management and technical posi-
tions are now filled with qualified staff; several other professional posts
are currently occupied in an acting capacity by junior staff. During negotia-
tions, the Government gave assurances that it will cause POPCOM to take all
necessary measures for improving its administrative operations, including the
following measures: (a) to prepare by October 31, 1979 an organization and
staffing plan for POPCOM; and (b) to employ, by October 31, 1979 and there-
after, suitable qualified professionals as associate directors, and as Manage-
ment Information Systems (MIS) and Research Chiefs.
2.15      In each of the 13 POPCOM regional population offices the 30 member
staff is divided into six units: finance, training, IEC, research, logistics
and field support team (for Project Outreach). Although some of the regional
offices are faced with staff capability constraints, in general their organi-
zational and technical situation is better than that at headquarters. There
is, however, a need for more adequate guidance from the central office and
for a staff development program aimed at improving staff quality. Regional
offices also need better equipment and transport to operate effectively in
the field.  Planning and programming capabilities need to be encouraged at the
regional level, as local needs are not always recognized when the planning is
done at the center.
2.16      Population staff at the provincial level consists of one provincial
population officer per province, who is on the staff of the provincial Gover-
nor, and receives technical supervision and logistics support from POPCOM's
regional offices. Until the end of 1984 the salaries of these officers, as
well as those of the municipal level population staff called full-time out-
reach workers (FTOW) are to be paid by POPCOM's central office using Project
Outreach funds provided by USAID.
Role of Other Agencies in the Program
2.17      There are about 40 agencies participating in the population pro-
gram; some of the major public and private agencies engaged in population
activities are described briefly in the following paragraphs.
2.18      The home economics extension program of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Bureau of Agricultural Extension, provides rural families with seriously
malnourished children with integrated family and community living activities,
which include nutrition and family planning education. Since 1972, the
Population Education Program of the Ministry of Education and Culture has been
promoting population awareness through the formal school system. The program,
which is supported by UNFPA, prepares curricula and materials for elementary
and secondary schools and colleges. Since 1972, the Ministry of Local Govern-
ment and Community Development (MLGCD) has included family planning IEC in
its community development, local government, and cooperative programs. The
Ministry of Social Services and Development provides information and counsel-
ling on family planning as part of its basic programs and services. The



- 8 -
Ministry also oversees the Population Awareness and Sex Education Program, the
aim of which is to prepare over one million out-of-school youth aged 13-24
years for responsible parenthood.
2419      The family planning project of the Institute of Maternal and Child
Health, organized in mid-1967, covers training and service delivery. By 1977,
this private organization which has been a pioneer in the field of family
planrning, had trained about 13,340 doctors, nurses, midwives and other health
and family planning workers from Government and private agencies. This agency
also operates about 353 family planning clinics in well-populated areas and
helps to coordinate the services of sterilization teams.
2.20      The Population Center Foundation, a primarily grant-giving agency
established in 1974 to encourage the participation of private groups in the
population program, finances projects which test innovative service delivery
systems. PCF also holds workshops and seminars on research utilization and
prepares IEC materials, training modules, quarterly and bi-monthly magazines
and state--of-the-art papers. Much of PCF's funding comes from POPCOM. The
Family Planning Organization of the Philippines is a private International
Planned Parenthood Federation-affiliate established in 1969. Through its
53 chapters, it provides TEC, training, clinical services, and research and
evaluation,
2.21      The University of the Philippines Population Institute offers grad-
uate courses in demography, sponsors conferences and seminars on demographic
data analysis, publishes research papers, and conducts in-service training
in population studies for personnel in Government, colleges, and universities.
Project Outreach Under POPCOM's Coordination
2.22      This USAID-financed project, begun in 1976, was operating throughout
the country by October 1978 and employing about 3,000 Full-Time Outreach
Workers in municipalities. The FTOWs were trained as information officers/
service providers and community organizers. Each FTOW is responsible for
recruiting, supervising and supplying contraceptives and IEC materials to five
to seven volunteer Barangay Supply Point Officers (BSPOs). By October 1978
about 21,000 Barangay Supply Points had been set up. The BSPOs prescribe and
resupply acceptors with pills, dispense condoms, and refer clients to health
clinics for family planning methods which require medical attention. It was
estimated that, by the end of 1977, contraceptive use prevalence in selected
surveyed areas where BSPOs were operating was close to 33%, compared with 27%
for the whole country.
2.23      Although Project Outreach was initially conceived to serve areas
where clinic services were limited or unavailable, in practice BSPOs have
been set up without reference to this criterion.  Health workers consequently
consider that the BSPOs' are duplicating their own functions and resent having
to treat complications arising from contraceptives dispensed by BSPOs. POPCOM
and MOH are completing an agreement to establish an appropriate division of
labor that would make clinic and BSPOs' services truly complementary. After
agreements are reached, both POPCOM and MOH will issue precise instructions
to their respective field staffs.

2.24            Project Outreach now has a network which should be extended to
all areas outside the reach of clinics, maximized, given sufficient time to
establish itself and be properly evaluated.  During negotiations, assurances
were given by the Government that it will cause POPCOM and MOH to reach a
final agreement, not later than December 31, 1979, on complementarity between
population fl- Id workers and the clinic services-under the population program.
Performance and Constraints of the Population Program
2.25            At the end of December 1977, there were almost 3,000 public and
private family planning clinics in the country, 672 sterilization centers and
21,500 Barangay Service Supply Points (Details in Annex 12, T-3). The per-
formance of the family planning program is presented in the following table.

2.26       The national contraceptive prevalence rate increased from an
estimated 15% in 1973 to 27% in 1978. Compared with most countries with
fertility reduction programs, this improvement over a five-year period is
considerable. The family planning services provided by the national program
have contributed to the decline in the birth rate in the 1970s as a result of
the cumulative increase in the number of contraceptive users. However, othler
countries in East Asia (some with older programs) have prevalence rates from
35% to 75%. The number of new acceptors assumed an upward trend up to l974,
and then became stationary and declined in 1977. This reflects a decline in
average clinic performance because couples eager to practice have already been
recruited and clinics, mostly located in urban areas, cannot meet the needs
of clientele outside a three to five kilometer radius. This is a pattern
experienced by many national programs. However, the declining trend in new
acceptors is of particular concern because the attainment of the Government's
goals of fertility reduction depend largely on maintaining a steady stream of
new acceptors for several years. This can be remedied only by intensive and
effective motivational programs and increased service coverage.
2.27      Data on contraceptive method mix (Annex 12, T-4) show that new
acceptors increasingly favored condoms while the proportion accepting pills
and TUDs declined between 1971 and 1976, the shift being most marked between
1971 and 1974. A contributing factor was the expansion of the program to
rural areas where there are few trained health workers to provide the more
complex (but more effective) methods such as IUDs and pills. Other factors
were side effects, misinformation, and, in the case of the pill, poor follow
up of dropouts and the lack of alternative brands for acceptors who experi-
enced side effects (only NORINYL is available now through the national pro-
gram, although recently UNFPA has agreed to provide other types of oral
contraceptives). Since 1975, however, the average number of months of effec-
tive protection has been increasing as a result of higher acceptance of
sterilization, from 17,000 in 1975 to 42,000 in 1976 and 69,000 in 1977.
Female sterilizations constitute almost 90% of all cases. By 1977, 1,200
physicians had been trained in sterilization procedures, and were working
in 672 sterilization centers and 15 mobile teams (203 centers were MOH hos-
pitals). Rhythm (natural family planning) has been used in the Philippines
since the program began; it is the only contraceptive method approved by the
Catholic Church.
Training
2.28       One of the main weaknesses of the family program is the inadequate
number of workers trained in family planning skills, program management, and
IEC. During 1972-74, population and family planning were introduced into
the priorities of other programs outside the health field and social workers,
municipal development officers, and volunteer workers were supposed to be
trained for motivational work. However, in 1974-75 and 1975-76, almost
75% of some 113,000 workers trained in population and family planning were
teachers. In CY1977, 80% of 34,200 workers trained were FTOWs and BSPOs of
Project Outreach. In the last five years, family planning training of exten-
sion and volunter workers and medical and paramedical personnel fell short of
program needs. Between 1974 and 1977 only 20% of all medical and paramedical
manpower in the country (both public and private) had received any training in



- 11 -
contraceptive methods and procedures. The training of health and other
workers in effective communication with the public has been inadequate.
2.29      In 1978, to prepare for the IDA population project, the training
unit of POPCOM developed a national training plan, designed to remedy these
deficiencies. This effort was undertaken in collaboration with other agencies
among which the most prominent was MOH.
2.30      Family planning training needs improvement in terms of quality as
well as quantity particularly as regards: (a) the teaching capabilities of
all personnel engaged in training; (b) coordination among training agencies;
(c) the relevance and practical content of curricula; (d) training in the art
of communicating with the public; (e) the use of an appropriate vocabulary
for training, which can be easily understood by workers and the general
public; and (f) creating opportunities for in-service training as part and
parcel of supervision, to minimize the need for formal training courses.
Information, Education and Communication
2.31      IEC activities in support of the population program were started on
a small scale in the 1960s by non-governmental organizations, and mainly took
the form of face-to-face communication. In the early 1970s various Government
agencies initiated IEC activities involving field motivators, production of
mass media materials, and formal and non-formal education. However, training
and supporting materials for these workers lagged behind and their IEC
activities were not properly coordinated; consequently, the effects were
limited.
2.32      In 1970, the Government's National Media Production Center estab-
lished a Population Information Education Office which designed and produced
over the years a number of flipcharts, leaflets, posters, calendars, slide
sets, films, and radio programs. With the gradual decentralization of the IEC
program, the Center's regional offices have taken over the production of IEC
materials for use in rural areas, while the central office now concentrates on
urban areas, especially Metro Manila. Since 1971 the chief source of research
in support of the IEC program has been the University of the Philippines
Institute of Mass Communication, which made a major inventory of regional TEC
needs in 1975 that contributed substantially to POPCOM's IEC strategy in
subsequent years. The Institute has also developed and tested a number of
prototype materials. UNFPA has provided support for these research and
development activities.
2.33      The shortcomings of the IEC program are reflected in what is known
as the "KAP gap", i.e., the gap between knowledge and awareness on the one
hand and practice on the other. The 1973 National Demographic Survey indicated
that while 62% of married couples of reproductive age approved of family
planning and 51% knew how to use a method, only 17% were actually practicing
family planning. The relatively high figures for knowledge and awareness are
a tribute to the program's past IEC efforts. Now the challenge is to translate
awareness into more solid knowledge, and knowledge into more effective action.



- 12 -
2.34      Four major analyses 1/ show that the following constraints affect
the IEC population field: (a) certain audiences are not being adequately
reached by the program, especially husbands and low income groups, but also
women who have recently had a baby, actual and potential dropouts and couples
about to be married; (b) materials do not always convey straightforward
information on contraceptive methods and their effectiveness under realistic
conditions; (c) translations are often not appropriate for low education,
rural audiences; (d) there are insufficient quantities of materials often
because no funds are available to move tested prototypes into mass produc-
tion; (e) materials fail to reach the lowest level (e.g., rural clinics);
(f) central and regional IEC technical staff are insufficient in numbers and
some need professional upgrading; (g) audiovisual (AV) equipment is in short
supply and inadequately maintained due to lack of funds; (h) there is a lack
of data on field worker performance and program impact, and many studies that
are available have not been used in planning IEC activities; and (i) better
coordination of IEC activities is needed. A master IEC plan prepared by
POPCOM in connection with the proposed second project, is designed to remedy
these shortcomings.
Management Information System
2.35      Since 1974, POPCOM has developed and implemented a computer-based
clinic information system which provides data on family planning acceptors
and a manual monitoring system for Project Outreach--Field Operations Monitor-
ing System--which handles financial, inventory and personnel data as well as
operational data. POPCOM still needs reliable service statistics and regular
data on contraceptive and equipment inventories, personnel, and financial
matters to exercise its coordinating and operating functions effectively.
Insufficient, incomplete and irregular information has delayed the identifi-
cation of problem areas in the program and allowed unfavorable conditions to
remain unattended for long periods. The development of information systems
for the population program which are relevant and responsive to the needs of
managers and supervisors is a priority. In order to establish an adequate
system, the present MIS unit at POPCOM would need to be strengthened with
technical staff. Compatibility and linkages among the health, population and
nutrition information systems under MOH, POPCOM and the National Nutrition
Council respectively appear desirable at the field level; it is also possible
that the three systems may benefit from utilizing common computer hardware for
data processing. Two feasibility studies are being financed under the first
Bank population project: one study will assess the possibility of linking the
three systems at various levels and a second study will determine the computer
hardware requirements of the three systems.

of the Philippines Institute of Mass Communication, and 1978 assess-
ment by the Special Committee to Review the Philippines Population
Program.

Population Research
2.36      A great quantity of population-related research has been done
in the Philippines, much of it on trends in fertility and mortality, patterns
of formation _nd age of marriage, migration and urbanization. In recent years
some research has been done on socioeconomic and demographic interrelation-
ships, primarily correlations of socioeconomic and geographical factors and
fertility; few have addressed fertility determinants. There have been also
numerous studies of family planning program effectiveness. Although some of
these studies have been useful to policy-makers and program planners, the
majority have not been utilized. Additional research identified by the
Special Committee as needed covers such subjects as: demographic levels,
patterns and trends; the socioeconomic determinants of fertility; the impact
of policies on demographic behavior; and improving the effectiveness of the
national population program.
2.37      There are about 26 institutions in the Philippines engaged
in population research; nearly all are Manila-based. Of these, the primary
contributors are the National Census and Statistics Office, University of the
Philippines Population Institute, PCF and Xavier University. The census office
has dealt primarily with census taking (1970, 1975) and analysis, prepared pop-
ulation projections, carried out a survey of households (including KAP-1972)
and participated in the World Fertility Survey. The state-supported Popula-
tion Institute conducted research and analysis on demographic levels and
trends and on socioeconomic variables. PCF, although not undertaking research
itself, has helped to fund basic biomedical research, a study of the socio-
economic correlates of fertility, and some pilot projects testing alternative
delivery systems, and has done much to disseminate research results.
2.38      Although the quality of population-related research in the Philip-
pines is quite good, there are four major shortcomings in the research done
to date. First, it has not been fully utilized partly due to failure to dis-
seminate it and partly because policy-makers and program planners have not
taken an active part in study, identification, and design of the research.
A second shortcoming has been a lack of order of priority among studies. A
third shortcoming is the lack of coordination as no one organization is fully
aware of all population-related ongoing research. A fourth constraint is that
most research is done by Manila-based institutions. The proposed project's
population research component has been designed to address these shortcomings
and to complement the efforts of other external donors in this area.
B. Health Services
Health Status
2.39      The average life expectancy at birth in the Philippines increased
from 55.6 years in 1968, to 61 years in 1975.  This compares favorably with



- 14 -
countries at a similar level of development. 1/ Certain communicable diseases
such as tuberculosis, gastroenteritis, and respiratory infections are still
prominent among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, although there
have been increases in cases and deaths from chronic diseases as a result of
increased life expectancy. The morbidity pattern in the country continues to
reflect relatively unfavorable environmental and nutritional conditions.
Infant mortality was 74 per 1,000 in 1976, but in rural areas it is still over
100 per 1,000. The leading causes of infant deaths are communicable diseases;
the underlying factors are poverty, high fertility, insufficient information
and education about basic health concepts and good health practices, mal-
nutrition, and poor environmental sanitation. Environment-related diseases
such as malaria continue to affect a great number of people, mostly in the
Cagayan Valley, South Western Mindanao, Palawan and Isabela. Schistosomiasis
is prevalent in the Mindanao and Eastern Visayas, with programs to combat these
diseases especially intensive in these regions.
National Goals and Strategies in the Health Sector
2.40      The Health, Population, and Nutrition chapter of the Five-Year
Philippine Development Plan 1978-82 includes among the main goals of the
health and nutrition sectors the following: (a) to extend life expectancy
(in years) from 61 in 1975, to 63 in 1983 and 66 in 1987; (b) to reduce infant
mortality from 74 per 1,000 live births in 1976, to 60 per 1,000 in 1983 and
56 in 1987; (c) to reduce the prevalence of second degree malnutrition among
children under six years of age from 25% to 16% in 1982 and 11% in 1987; and
(d) to reduce morbidity from priority communicable diseases 2/ by 20% by 1983
and by 45% by 1987 from present levels.
2.41      The Plan proposes to attain these goals by increasing the range
of services offered, by reaching more people--especially in city slums and
depressed areas--and by encouraging people to make better use of the services
provided. The private sector and voluntary agencies will be encouraged to
increase their health activities among low-income groups. Funds received from
external sources will be utilized to complement national resources.
2.42      The National Health Plan recognizes that large families, frequent
pregnancies, and low standards of living and nutrition that accompany rapid
population growth aggravate existing health problems and impose an increasing
burden on the health services. Another urgent health-related problem identi-
fied in the National Health Plan is malnutrition. In 1977, a nationwide
weight survey found that 78% of the more than four million pre-school children
examined were malnourished. Of those, 6% were severely malnourished (third
degree), 25% moderately malnourished (second degree), and 47% slightly
1/   For example, in 1975 in Thailand the average life expectancy at birth
was 59 years and in Indonesia, 49 years.
2/   Gastroenteritis, tuberculosis, malaria, and schistosomiasis.



- 15 -
moderately malnourished (second degree), and 47% slightly malnourished (first
degree). Only 22% were of normal weight. Malnutrition is due not only to
inadequate food, but also to dietary habits and cultural practices. This
points to the need for intensifying nutrition education which has up to
now received very limited resources among the Ministry of Health programs,
although official policy is now changing in this respect.
2.43      The above stated strategies and policies of the Government in the
fields of population, health, and nutrition are sound. The Government has
a clear commitment to reduce fertility and proposes an integrated framework
which would take into account the interactions between the fertility behavior
of couples and health, nutrition, and education. The program will, however,
impose a severe burden on the staff and organization of both MOH and POPCOM,
and the proposed second project is designed to increase the capacity of these
agencies to carry it out.
2.44      Although the public health services sector (national, provincial,
and municipal) are responsible for providing health care for about 67% of the
population, 1/ they currently reach only one-half of that number. In 1978,
health ranked fourth  in total new appropriation of Government funds with 4%
of the total national budget. Of this amount, 82% went to the Ministry of
Health. The private health sector spends as much on personal medical care
as the Government spends on public health services. It is not realistic to
expect any substantial increase in the share of resources devoted to health in
the near future. It is therefore important to find the most economic way of
extending health services to the people now not served.
2.45      Under the Restructured Health Care Delivery System started as part
of the first project, MOH redistributed functions among health team members to
achieve a better utilization of doctors and nurses, who now can delegate some
functions to auxiliary personnel. In spite of the progress made so far (about
45% of the MOH health staff has already been retrained) much more remains to
be done to extend health and family planning services to the one-third of the
total population (mostly rural) who now lack them. A study in five provinces
of the country has shown that, even when fully implemented, the RHCDS could
not meet more than 47% of community health needs, since only those persons
living within a radius of three kilometers of health centers can easily
avail themselves of their services. The Government has decided to test
further innovations in low cost health care based on encouragement of self-
care, community sharing of costs, preventive actions, and the use of community
health workers trained in appropriate technologies (the Primary Health Care--
PHC--approach is discussed in paras 3.30-3.34).
1/   It is estimated that one-third of the population, mostly in urban areas,
has access to private medical care. Most of the remaining two-thirds
dependent on public health care live in rural areas and urban slums;
these two-thirds of the population should receive health care from
the Rural Health UJnits and Barangay Health Stations, but actual coverage
is about half of the target or approximately one-third of the population.

Organization and Manpower of the MOH Health Services
2.46      The MOH health and family planning delivery system comprises four
levels: central, regional, provincial and local. The organization of the
Ministry of Health is shown in Annex 1, C-3. There are 12 regional health
offices, each of which maintains a training center and a laboratory. There
are 76 provincial health offices.
2.47      At the local or field level, the health and family planning ser-
vices of MOH are administered by: (a) 60 city health offices in chartered
cities which, although directly under the jurisdiction of the regional health
offices, are fully funded by the city governments; (b) 1,700 main health
centers (MHC) located in urban areas called municipalities, each of which
provides services to about 20,000 to 50,000 people within a three to five
kilometer radius; 1/ (c) 236 community hospitals and health centers with
almost 10,000 beds, situated in municipalities lacking easy access to city
hospitals (in most cases these hospitals serve as main health centers for
those municipalities); and (d) about 100 hospitals with a total of about
20,000 beds (70% in Metro-Manila). Some MHCs are supported by three to six
satellite Barangay Health Stations (BHSs) (there are only about 3,000 BHSs
in the country). MHCs are basically staffed by one doctor, one nurse, two to
three midwives and one sanitary inspector, although more staff are assigned
to MHCs serving large populations. The complex of one MHC, several satellite
BHSs and, occasionally, another health center, is now called a Rural Health
Unit (RHU). (See Annex 12, T-5 for details on health facilities.)
2.48      The key health personnel are physicians, nurses, midwives and
sanitary inspectors. In 1977 there were altogether 48,500 health workers in
the country. Of those, 13,100 were doctors , 8,200 nurses, 7,000 midwives and
2,700 sanitary inspectors (details are shown in T-6 in Annex 12). About 30%
of the doctors and the same proportion of nurses are in the public health
services. Although the medical, nursing, and midwifery schools in the country
turn out as many professionals as the country needs, they are unevenly distri-
buted because they prefer to live in the urban areas which offer the best
career and earning prospects. The Government is aware of this problem and is
committed to taking remedial action. However, realistically this situation
will take a long time to change significantly. This makes the potential for
using paraprofessional workers more important. An interministerial committee
is preparing guidelines on the use of para-professional health workers by
Government and private agencies, including whether and how these cadres should
be paid.
1/   In cases where there is more than one health center in a municipality,
one is designated as Main Health Center and takes leadership in health
matters in that municipality.

Performance and Constraints of Health Services
2.49      The present health and family planning delivery system in the
Philippines suffers from: (a) over-centralized planning and management;
(b) existence of a large number of offices/bureaus/units at the central
level with no clear definition of functions and often with overlapping re-
sponsibilities; (c) weak coordination and communication among the various
offices at the central level; (d) scarcity of adequately trained managerial
staff at all levels which results in lack of planning and proper prioritiz-
ing of programs and a lack of technical, administrative and logistic support
for peripheral units; (e) consequent deficiencies in the peripheral units
reflected in inefficient utilization of resources, inadequately trained and
supervised staff, failure of logistics and supply systems, poor utilization
of the health facilities by communities and inadequate outreach of the health
personnel into the community; and (f) weak coordination of MOH's programs
with those of other relevant ministries.
2.50      Recognizing these problems, the Ministry of Health decided that
a functional analysis of the health delivery system be carried out before
making any changes. The object of this study is to identify the various
causes of dysfunctions within the health services and to suggest remedies.
This study will be carried out during 1979 as part of the activities under
an amendment to the first Bank population project. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from the Government that it will make the study
results available to the Association by December 31, 1979 and that by April
30, 1980 it will consult with the Association on a timetable for implementa-
tion of the recommendations arising from this study.
Training
2.51      Although it has been recognized since the mid-1950s that in-service
training was necessary to increase the efficiency and quality of the health
service staff, inadequate funds have been devoted to this kind of training.
During preparation of the first Bank project, training was identified as
particularly in need of support. With a view to implementing the training
component of the project more effectively, the Government decided to create
a new training unit alongside the existing Office of Health Education and
Personnel Training (OHEPT) in MOH. Although this approach proved successful
from the point of view of preparing curricula, organizing training and meeting
targets, several problems developed including: (a) organizational dysfunctions--
two units in a Ministry undertaking the same functions; (b) unsatisfactory cur-
ricula in several areas--e.g., family planning and IEC--because of insufficient
consultation with pertinent central offices of MOH; and (c) lack of institu-
tionalization of training programs in MOH.
2.52      While processing the second population project, an analysis of
training activities in MOH undertaken by the Government reached the follow-
ing conclusions: (a) there is a need to strengthen OHEPT's technical and
managerial capabilities in order to enable it to design, organize, administer
and evaluate MOH training programs; (b) the temporary training unit estab-
lished for the first project should be merged with OHEPT, thus strengthening



- 18 -
that office with the experienced personnel; (c) NFPO's training division,
which has hitherto been responsible for family planning training within MOH,
should retain responsibility for family planning training, but should work in
close coordination with OHEPT; (d) MOH trainers at all levels need upgrading
in training and supervisory skills, and as a first step a core of "master
trainers" should be developed to institutionalize among all MOH trainers the
capability to design, administer, implement, evaluate and re-cycle training
programs; (e) the proportion of practice to theory in training programs for
health personnel should be increased and be made more relevant to desirable
behavioral modifications iii job performance; and (f) concerning family pla.n-
ning training, it is desirable to share training resources (consultants, re-
source personnel, trainers and training materials) among all participating
agencies in order to ensure a common national approach.
Health Education/IEC
2.53      Although there has been a health education unit in MOH since 1920,
it has never been allocated enough funds to enable it to have much impact.
In addition to the staff of this unit, there are a few health educators
working on special projects in other branches of MOH headquarters. Gradually
a corps of health educators has also been developed in the field with two in
most regional health offices, one or two in about half of the provincial
health offices, and several in city health offices. Most of the printed
materials produced in MOH during the past several years have been reproduced
in small quantities only, essentially for pretesting.   In recent years,
external support for health education has largely been limited to WHO assist-
ance in staff development. During project preparation, IEC was identified as
one of the weakest aspects of the RHCDS. The health education/IEC system has
suffered from the absence of an overall plan. In consequence, the IEC work
being carried out as part of various vertical programs (e.g., nutrition,
immunization, family planning, environmental sanitation) is largely uncoordi-
nated. Another weakness is the lack of training and supervision of the rural
health staff responsible for face-to-face communication with the public and
community leaders. Health education in the field also suffers from a dearth
of IEC materials and AV equipment. During project preparation, MOH developed
an overall IEC plan for health services which addresses the major weaknesses
and serves as the basis for the MOH/IEC component of the second project.
Management Information Systems
2.54       The MIS UJnit initiated through the first population project has
been incorporated into the MOH structure. That Unit, with the assistance of
consultants, has developed and is implementing systems to monitor finance,
inventory and personnel and is currently preparing systems to monitor the
operation of hospitals and rural health units. The process of systems devel-
opment has been slow, but the problems have not been unusual for this complex
field which requires specialized expertise. The rural health unit sub-system,
for instance, is still not producing usable data at the national level, but
it is being tested in a few provinces. Results from those tests will be used
in the further development of that system and its national implementation is



- 19 -
planned to be effected by end-1979.  The MIS will require financial and
technical assistance over the next five years to enable it to acquire and
place in operation computer and peripheral hardware needed to make the
system fully operational; regular evaluation of its effectiveness will also
be essential.
C. First Bank Population Project
2.55      In 1974 the Bank made a US$25 million loan for a first population
project designed to: (a) strengthen POPCOM's capacity to coordinate the
population program establishing a training division and an IEC division,
and 12 regional offices; and (b) improve service delivery by helping MOH
introduce a "Restructured Health Care Delivery System" and further expand
the delivery of services in rural areas. The POPCOM component of the project
was undertaken with parallel financing from USAID and UNFPA; the Government
has already absorbed the consequent increase in recurrent costs. The loan
agreement was amended in December 1978 to enable additional activities and
equipment to be financed from unneeded contingency funds. The total cost
of the amended project is US$40 million. The loan of US$25 million, is
allocated as follows: US$9.5 million for construction; US$6.5 million for
equipment and furniture; US$3.9 million for technical assistance and training;
US$0.8 million for IEC; US$1.0 million for incremental recurrent costs; and
US$3.3 for contingencies. The first project consists of financing:
(a) for service expansion: in MOH, new buildings for 207 RHUs
and 12 regional training centers, the hiring of 5,000 mid-
wives to serve in rural barangays and the procurement of
400 vehicles; and in POPCOM, procurement of radio equipment
and 161 vehicles;
(b) for training, establishment of a training division in POPCOM
and courses in teaching methodology, management, planning,
primary health care, and family planning skills under POPCOM
and participating agencies, including MOH;
(c) for IEC, a mass media campaign and production of IEC materials
in support of the population program and additional technical
staff for POPCOM's IEC Division;
(d) establishment of an MIS in MOH and feasibility studies for
an inter-linked health, population and nutrition MIS and for
assessment of computer hardware needs;
(e) preparation of a second project and several studies,
including one of a condom marketing scheme and a functional
analysis of the Ministry of Health; and
(f) technical assistance for several of the above components.



- 20 -
2.56      The first project was designed in 1973-74, when the population pro-
gram was just starting. The Government had identified the MOH network as a
main conduit for family planning services and adopted a policy of integration
of health and family planning services. Other donors, and most prominently
USAID, were providing the bulk of the external assistance for the software
aspects of the program, i.e., contraceptives, salaries, research, evaluation,
etc. The Bank assessment during project identification concluded that while
the inputs that were being provided through such assistance were essential
to establish the program, on a long-term perspective: (a) the MOH health
services would need considerable strengthening to stand successfully the
additional burden of a new and difficult program such as family planning;
and (b) the population program should be multisectoral, utilizing many other
agencies besides the health services, and therefore a strong umbrella agency--
POPCOM--was needed to coordinate activities. The project was formulated on
the basis of these premises; the components were chosen to begin assisting the
institutional development of the two main agencies responsible for the program--
MOH and POPCOM.
2.57      The first project will be completed by December 31, 1979.  At
that time the main health centers built will be operating in over 200 towns
scattered in 56 of the 76 provinces of the Philippines (see map); they will
serve as referral points for rural midwives who work in rural barangays
surrounding the centers, in addition to providing services to persons living
nearby. The 5,000 midwives hired through the project are trained and posted
in rural barangays, their salaries already picked up in the Government's
regular budget. Nine of the scheduled 12 regional training centers, are now
operating; they house trainees and teaching staff for in-service health and
family planning courses.
2.58      The impact of this project on health improvement and fertility
reduction activities will be measured on a continued basis through the MIS
established by the project. The first such data are expected by mid-1981
(see para. 3.28). Although there are still organizational and technical
shortcomings in the two agencies that the project was designed to assist,
the environment for improving their programs has definitely been enhanced
as a result of the first project. The benefits derived so far are: (a) a
strong and constructive dialog has been established, not only between the
Bank and the two implementing agencies, but also between the POPCOM and MOH,
and among international and bilateral agencies assisting the population pro-
gram; and (b) the problems faced in implementing the project, i.e., weaknesses
of the "project unit" approach, and deficiencies in family planning training,
have contributed to a better designed second project that is fine tuned to
improve the agencies organizationally and technically, while reemphasizing
the need to address the long-term requirements of the health and population
programs. The project inputs of physical infrastructure in MOH and training
and additional personnel in both POPCOM and MOH are all necessary resources
in the continued, long-term process of institution building and program
improvement.

D. External Assistance to Population and Health Programs in the Philippines
2.59      Until 1973, more than 60% of the population program was financed by
external assistance. In CY1977, the share of foreign assistance had declined
to about 45%. This proportion is expected to level off at about 20% in 1982.
Past contributi,)ns and projected amounts of population assistance to the
Philippines are presented in Annex 12, T-7. The main external donor has
been USAID and the next largest contributors have been the Bank and UNFPA.
Other donors had obligated a total of US$8 million through the end of 1977.
The Government contributed US$44 million for the period 1969-1977.
2.60      Throughout the preparation of the proposed project, USAID, UNFPA,
and the Association--the main external contributors-- have been in close
coordination to ensure that there will be no overlapping of assistance.
2.61      The largest external financial assistance received for the health
program in the Philippines in recent years has been through the first Bank
assisted population project (para. 2.55). Also two other Bank projects--one
rural and one urban development project--have health components consisting of
providing buildings for MHCs and BHSs. The next largest contributor has been
USAID, in the past mainly for the nutrition program and, more recently, for
health services. In 1978, USAID approved a US$5.4 million loan for a five-
year health project for Panay Island (Project PUSH) aimed at improving the
health status of the population living in 600 depressed barangays (336,000
beneficiaries). WHO and UNICEF render a wide range of technical assistance
in the health field. The latter also provides financial support for training,
equipment and vehicles mainly devoted to improving maternal and child health
care; recently it approved financing for a four-year vaccination program.
III.   THE PROJECT
A. Project Concept
3.01      This project was designed to assist the Philippines in its efforts
to reduce fertility levels over the next five years and, at the same time,
to decrease infant mortality and malnutrition among children and improve the
health status of semi-urban and rural populations. The project design is
based on the premise that fertility reduction on the one hand and improved
child survival and better family health on the other, are interconnected
and mutually influencing events. Awareness by parents that they can raise
healthy children is thought to be an important factor in stimulating family
planning practice. Improvements in the provision of health services and
health education may therefore be significant in making the practice of
family planning widely acceptable. A second connection which is basic to
the design of this project is that the health services are a major structure
for delivering family planning services and that in order to improve these
services it is necessary to address the major problems and constraints of the
parent health system. A third consideration in project formulation is that,



- 22 -
apart from the direct effects of improved health and family planning services
on fertility reduction, there is a need for support and institutional develop-
ment of the coordinating structure of the national population program at
central, regional and local levels in order that it may exert effective policy-
making, planning, coordination, and evaluation of all population-related
activities. A fourth aspect taken into account is that in order to increase
effectively the health and family planning service outreach it is not enough
to expand the formal infrastructure of facilities and personnel, but it is
essential to obtain the widespread participation of an informed and knowledge-
able community.  PersonLnel training and IEC activities are, thus, essential
components of this project.
3.02      The arrangements for project implementation take into account the
experience, including both strengths and weaknesses, of the health and family
planning programs, and especially, of the first project during the past 5
years. The project will assist the two main organizations involved in the
population program--POPCOMl, the "umbrella", coordinating body, and MOH, the
main family planning service provider. It will consist of two parts: (a)
Part A, under POPCOM, will finance a central and field staff development
program emphasizing training and recruitment, IEC activities, population
research and an appropriate regional infrastructure; and (b) Part B, under
MOH, will strengthen and expand the restructured health care delivery system,
initiate primary health care schemes in the 12 health regions, and improve
administration, supervision, training and IEC.
B. Project Objectives
3.03      The objective of the project is to assist the Government to reach
the target of providing 40% of couples in reproductive ages with family plan-
ning services by 1982 and 50% by 1987, and the health and nutrition targets
stated in para. 2.40, by increasing the proportion of the population reached
by MOH's services from the present 33% to at least 50%. The project is
expected to: (a) increase the number of couples practicing family planning
as a result of considerably intensified IEC efforts, improved clinic services
by well trained and supervised staff, the opening of new health facilities and
the introduction of primary health care (PILC) schemes; (b) reduce infant mor-
tality through better health care services to mothers and children, better
birth spacing, and the inculcation of better health practices by an intensive
IEC program; (c) reduce second degree malnutrition of pre-school chidren by
means of improved counseling to mothers, early detection and follow-ups,
intensified nutrition education, and a faster response to nutrition problems
in areas identified by the nutrition surveillance system which forms part of
the MIS component; and (d) reduce morbidity and mortality from priority
communicable diseases as a result of preventive IEC campaigns and prompter
treatment of cases by better trained staff well supplied with appropriate
medicines.

D. Detailed Project Description
Part A: Commission on Population
Expansion of POPCOM's Infrastructure
3.05      After the organizational and managerial problems affecting POPCOM's
Secretariat at the central level are satisfactorily resolved (para. 2.14) it
will need assistance at the regional level in the form of buildings, equipment,
and vehicles to undertake its coordinating role and to operate the IEC and
training programs.
3.06      Regional Offices.  The project will help finance infrastructure
for POPCOM's regional offices. Buildings for six of the 13 POPCOM Regional
Offices were financed in 1974-75 through a USAID grant. The remaining seven
offices are poorly housed in rented quarters, which do not provide a proper
environment for conducting coordinating activities such as meetings and
seminars and for storing IEC, training equipment and contraceptives, keeping
and repairing vehicles and enabling in-house production of printed materials,
audio tapes, and photo processing. The project will finance new buildings,
equipment and furniture for POPCOM Regional Offices in the following regions:
Central Luzon (Region III), Metro Manila (Region IV), Eastern Visayas (Region
VIII), Western Mindanao (Region IX), Southern Mindanao (Region XI), and
Eastern Mindanao (Region XII) and Southern Tagalog (Region XIII). Each
building will provide office space for 30-35 staff, a conference and lecture
r6om, a library, a production room and a photo laboratory; it will also
include a storage area or small warehouse for contraceptives and for training
and IEC materials and equipment, and a garage for keeping and repairing vehi-
cles. Warehouses and garages will also be built adjacent to the existing six
POPCOM Regional Offices in: La Union (Region I), Tuguegarao (Region II),
Albay (Region V), Iloilo (Region VI), Cebu (Region VII), and Misamis Oriental
(Region X). The POPCOM will train 26 drivers as automobile mechanics to
repair and maintain the vehicle fleet in good condition.
3.07      Vehicles and Radio Communication.  POPCOM has a fleet of 339 vehicles
of which about 200 (59%) are in poor state of repair. Under the amended first
population project, 161 utility vehicles will be added in CY1979 for deliver-
ing contraceptives and other materials, for field visits, and for training
purposes, both in relation with Project Outreach and other POPCOM coordinating
activities. This second project will finance the procurement of another 85
vehicles, as follows: 14 audiovisual vans for film showings, photo exhibits
and mobile displays; 26 two-wheel drive, 13 four-wheel drive vehicles and 4
heavy duty vehicles for monitoring and coordinating field activities and
transporting staff and materials; 26 two-wheel drive vehicles for transporting
contraceptive supplies, IEC materials, and equipment from regional offices to
the field; and 2 dual-drive trucks to haul commodities to and from piers for
shipment to regional warehouses or for direct transportation to regional
warehouses. The project will also finance 21 boats for the transport of staff
and supplies, to be used to reach otherwise inaccessible coastal and island
towns. Single-side band radio equipment will also be financed to extend the
network already available to POPCOM, which was partly financed through the
first Bank project.

Training in Population and Family Planning
3.08      Training is essential to the success of the population program.
There is need for a concerted effort over the next five years to train
trainers, program staff and field workers, in order to remove the constraints
listed in para. 2.28. The national population training plan covers training
activities carried out by some 20 agencies with POPCOM's coordination.
Developing the plan involved the following steps: (a) the national program's
available manpower were analyzed by category and functions; (b) administrative/
managerial constraints requiring decisions and solutions other than training
were identified, described, and presented to the agencies' managements for
proper resolution; and (c) all remaining constraints which were amenable to
improvement through training were spelled out and specific training activi-
ties were designed to address those problems or deficiencies.
3.09      The objectives of the POPCOM training component of this project
are to enhance the capacity of trainers at various levels in designing,
conducting, evaluating and re-cycling population/family planning training
programs; and to enable effective large-scale training of managerial and
service delivery staff. In order to achieve these objectives, in implementing
this training component POPCOM and the participating agencies will give
priority to the training of trainers (using as a basis the "master trainers"
organized under the first project); also, training resources (consultants,
trainers and training materials) will be shared by the agencies. The
POPCOM Training Division will coordinate the implementation of the POPCOM
population training component of the project with the help of a coordinating
team at the working level in which all the participating agencies will be
represented. The POPCOM training component is distinct from the MOII family
planning training component; the latter will be directed by NFPO in coopera-
tion with OHEPT.
3.10      The POPCOM training component will finance technical assistance,
teaching equipment and materials, and the incremental recurrent costs for the
following training activities (for a list of courses, see Annex 2): teaching
methodology for "master" trainers and trainers of trainers; management;
information/motivation on the population program; record-keeping, logistics,
administrative and financial management, disbursements and accounting; plan-
ning and staff development; skills training in IEC; and family planning skills
(including pill dispensing, IUD insertion and sterilization techniques). This
training component will be complementary with assistance that POPCOM will
receive from UNFPA and USAID for other training activities.
Demand Creating Activities - IEC
3.11       IEC Objectives.  The purpose of the POPCOM IEC component, is to
increase the acceptance and practice of family planning by encouraging:
(a) non-users and dropouts to use effective family planning methods;
(b) current users to switch from less effective methods
to more effective methods;



- 27 -
(c)  husbands to support their wives' family planning practice or to
practice a male method themselves;
(d) youth to delay marriage, to enter marriage with the intention of
delaying the first birth, and to integrate family planning into
their marital life;
(e) political, religious, and other leaders; officials; professional
groups; and other influential persons, to suipport family planning
practice and the overall aims of the population program; and
(f) communities to accept family planning as a normal aspect of
everyday family life.
3.12      Major Strategies.  The design of the expanded IEC program is based
on the analysis of the life cycle of the typical Filipino: the institutions
through which he or she passes and the times when key decisions are made
in relation to family life. Thus the program stresses (in developmental
order): population education for children and youth in school (to be supported
by UNFPA), family life education for out-of-school youth, premarital informa-
tion for couples who are about to be married, family planning information for
married couples and postpartum mothers, and follow-up services for actual or
potential dropouts. In addition, a number of activities will be supported
that would reach those who in turn influence these ultimate users: various
leadership and professional audiences and those who control resources needed
by the program as a whole (e.g., mass media executives, heads of extension
services, and municipal health officers).
3.13      Instead of, as in the past, acting as a passive conduit for funds
and as monitoring agency, POPCOM will in the future act as leader of the par-
ticipating agencies in IEC and other areas. While POPCOM will provide proj-
ect resources to enable specific participating agencies to continue and expand
their contributions to the national population program, there will be improved
mechanisms for planning and coordination. Mass media materials will be
designed to support the efforts of field workers, and field workers will be
encouraged to refer clients to the mass media to reinforce or validate their
own messages. The design, development and, where appropriate, the production
of materials will increasingly be decentralized to take account of substantial
regional differences in knowledge, attitudes and practices. Some programming
will be carried out separately by each region, and in other cases, neighboring
regions with the same dialect or similar cultural groups will combine forces
for joint implementation. Although it has been assumed for planning purposes
that resources should be provided on the same scale for each region, POPCOM
proposes to allocate such resources taking into account the number of married
couples of reproductive age, the overall IEC capacity of the regional staff
(both in POPCOM and in participating agencies), the number of mass media
outlets and any prioritization for regional support that may result from
changes in program strategies.



- 28 -
3.14      Main Channels.  The IEC program will utilize the rich variety and
extensive availability of media and "human channels" (e.g., field-workers).
The program is based on specific research findings and the now conventional
wisdom that the field-worker is the crucial link between the program and the
people, having far more impact than the mass media, which can only provide
information and reinforce inter-personal communication. The project will
facilitate the IEC activities of special purpose population workers, other
extension workers, and groups of volunteers in two main ways: through train-
ing in IEC skills and provision of training materials (films and manuals);
and through provision of audio-visual aids and various printed handouts.
3.15      The media mix is based on the overall communication situation in the
Philippines, which is described in more detail in Annex 3. The project will
provide assistance in the design, development, mass replication and dissemina-
tion of radio programs and spot announcements, newspaper articles and adver-
tisements, cinema spots and films, comic books and a variety of traditional or
folk media. A detailed list of materials to be produced is given in Annex 3.
Since the distribution of support materials has repeatedly been identified
as the weak link in the TEC program, during negotiations the Government gave
assurances that it will cause POPCOM to undertake a review of the IEC distri-
bution system and that the recommendations arising from such review will be
conveyed to the Association by October 31, 1980.
3.16      Supporting Structure for IEC.  In order to carry out the greatly
expanded population IEC program, the staff and equipment of POPCOM and the
participating agencies must be strengthened. One junior and four senior
staff members will be added to the IEC Division of POPCOM.  Senior staff will
be added to the central planning, training and research divisions. The IEC
units of each POPCOM regional office will be strengthened by the addition of
two senior professionals and a second mobile information, education, and
motivation team. New and existing POPCOM staff (including, of course, IEC
staff) will benefit from the training program (para. 3.10) and selected staff
will receive fellowships enabling them to participate in a one-year course
in population communication, to study effective IEC activities in other coun-
tries, and to obtain specialized technical training overseas. A total of
4.2 person-years of consultant services in IEC related matters will provide
POPCOM with technical guidance on a range of topics, including equipment
maintenance and evaluation. Each regional office will be provided with a
four-wheel drive van. Each of 76 provinces will be supplied with basic AV
equipment (slide and film projectors, cassette tape recorders, screens and
other miscellaneous items). During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from the Government that POPCOM, in consultation with the participating
agencies, will develop not later than December 31, 1980, a system acceptable
to the Association for the management and maintenance of these equipment
pools. Such a system should include a policy on priority uses of the equip-
ment; a mechanism for monitoring its use and whereabouts; and a scheme for
supplying replacement parts and carrying out general maintenance and repair
of equipment.



- 29 -
3.17      IEC Research and Evaluation.  The project will finance several
research projects of special relevance to the IEC program. Consultants will
evaluate the effectiveness of such items as the population education program
for out-of-school youth, the premarital information program, and materials for
fieldwork. POPrOM will collect baseline data for measuring the impact of the
population IEC )rogram. Funds for this and subsequent measurements are
included under the research component of the project.
Research on Population and Family Planning
3.18      As discussed (para. 2.36), although a massive amount of population-
related research has been carried out over the past decade, it has not been
linked with policy and program needs, nor has there been appreciable feedback
into operations. The proposed research component will complement the assis-
tance provided for population research by other external donors--especially
UNFPA and USAID--and will help POPCOM to select and design research activities
more responsive to policy and program needs, and to disseminate the results
quickly and in a usable form.
3.19      To encourage closer linkage between research and policy and opera-
tions, POPCOM will conduct semi-annual two-day workshops of about 25 research
workers and administrators, and initiate a regular publications program. In
addition, the research and evaluation coordinators in POPCOM's regional
offices, whose services have not been properly utilized in the past, will help
identify operationally useful research studies.
3.20      Proposals for twelve specific studies urgently needed were developed
by POPCOM and will be financed by the project (they are listed in Annex 4).
They address current policy and program needs, and the users of the results
have been identified. It is expected that the need for additional studies
will emerge during the project period. A small amount of funds for these
additional studies and for any other study identified by the regional research
and evaluation coordinators may be made available from the innovative activi-
ties component of this project if they meet the requisite criteria (see para.
3.23). POPCOM will encourage institutions outside Metro Manila to build up
research capability.
3.21      The proposed research component will be administered by POPCOM's
Research UJnit in the Planning Division. During negotiations the Government
gave assurances that it will employ, by October 31, 1979, and thereafter
maintain a suitably qualified professional as Chief of the Research Unit. Two
research staff from each of POPCOM's functional units (IEC, Training and
Clinical Services) would be reassigned to the Division to assist with the
increased workload. Tn addition, two senior researchers and an editor (for
publications) will be contracted. Local consultants will be engaged to advise
on the technical design of studies and to evaluate research proposals. One-
day workshops of about 25 representatives of concerned agencies will be held
quarterly to monitor ongoing and plan future research. The regional research
and evaluation coordinators will also meet semi-annually.



- 30 -
Management Information System
3.22      POPCOM needs to strengthen its MIS Division (para 2.35) by training
existing staff in technical aspects of data processing to form a group of 10
data processing professionals, 6 population data specialists and 4 computer
operators.  The necessary staff training is included in the POPCOM training
component.  The project will also finance 22.5 person months of overseas
fellowships in: computer technology (use of terminals, communication input-
output, and storage devices); information system development (including
training in structured design and programming, software engineering, manage-
ment of systems development, and use of equipment and software such as report
writers, programming language processors, and program library systems); and
data administration/data base management (including techniques for controlling
data and use of packages such as data dictionaries, data base management
systems, and query processors). Another important project contribution to the
POPCOM/MIS will be six person-months of consultant services to help determine
the information needs of management at all levels, the frequency and timing
of reports, and the deficiencies of the present system. During negotiations,
the Government gave assurances that it will employ, by October 31, 1979 and
thereafter maintain a suitable qualified manager (or chief) for the MIS Unit.
The inputs of this component will be complemented by essential advisory ser-
vices in management information systems to be provided with USAID financing.
Innovative Activities - Population
3.23      Experience with the first Philippines population project and with
projects in other countries have shown the advisability of providing funds
for support of innovative activities that may develop in the course of
project implementation. In this project, funds amounting to US$900,000 have
been allocated for innovative population activities that may be identified
during implementation of Part A of this project. Some of these innovative
activities could be an outgrowth of a project component (e.g. local IEC
programs or additional research studies), or they may be entirely new activi-
ties. The utilization of these funds by the Government will be subject to
the same degree of care and scrutiny on the Association's part as it has been
the case for other project components. To obtain the Association's approval,
proposals must meet the following criteria: (a) relevance to program objec-
tives; (b) appropriateness of financing from the credit; (c) feasibility of
administration and evaluation; and (d) demonstrated replicability with regular
program means. Approval of these proposals will be a condition of disburse-
ment against this category (para. 7.03).
Part B: Ministry of Health
Expansion of Health, Family Planning and Nutrition Services
3.24      The Government's long-term health, population, and nutrition goals
will be difficult to attain unless health service coverage is expanded in the
next decade to the one-third of the country's population currently without
adequate health care. The network of hospitals, main health centers, and
barangay health stations (described in para. 2.47) is the backbone of ser-
vice delivery. The physical infrastructure, equipment, and staffing,
especially at the periphery (BHSs), require expansion. As already noted



- 31 -
(para. 2.45), even if the RHCDS were operating at maximum efficiency, it could
only meet the needs of persons living within a radius of three kilometers of
the clinics. In this light, the Government's thrust to provide services to
peripheral villages would need a complementary move originating from the com-
munity. The key to this approach is to elicit community acceptance and partici-
pation through non-professional health workers who can bridge effectively the
wide cultural gap between the people and the modern health care approach.
3.25      The health services expansion component of the project will consist
of: (a) expansion of physical infrastructure; (b) strengthening of logistics;
and (c) development of primary health care schemes using barangay health
workers. This service expansion will be complemented by qualitative improve-
ments in manpower and supervision (through the training component), in demand
creation among the community (through the IEC component), and in management
and evaluation (through the MIS component).
3.26      Expansion of Physical Infrastructure.  This project would finance
construction of 75 health centers and 915 BHSs in 19 provinces where health
facilities fall far short (40 to 60%) of the prescribed norm of one MHC per
20,000 people and one BHS per 5,000 population. Although there are deficien-
cies in other provinces as well, this component will be confined to the
provinces most in need. New health centers 1/ will only be built in places
where services are now not available (no replacements of existing buildings--
either owned by the Government or rented--will be included in this project).
This will ensure a net increase in service coverage. BHSs will be built only
in barangays where midwives (mainly hired, trained and posted as part of the
first Bank population project) are operating without adequate facilities or
equipment, or where no services at all are available. During negotiations,
assurances were given by the Government that it will employ in time staff for
each of the 75 health centers and the 915 BHSs to be built through the project.
3.27      BHSs, which are simple structures, will be built by the local com-
munity (this approach is being tested during 1979 in 25 barangays with funds
from the first population project). The implementation of this BHS component
is described in para 5.15. It is expected that community participation in
building BHSs, in addition to cutting construction costs, will also increase
community concern for cooperating with the midwife in maintaining the BPS,
volunteering to help her in various health tasks, and making use of the
services offered there by the resident midwife and visiting health personnel.
3.28      Through its MIS, the MOH will give priority to obtaining data on the
utilization of facilities--distinguishing between existing and first and second
project facilities--which should enable the MOH to detect any cases of low
utilization; annual data will be processed regularly on a nationwide basis,
starting with data for CY1980. These data, together with training in mapping
to be given to municipal health officers under the training component, should
facilitate in the future the effective planning of physical infrastructure for
the health and family planning delivery system.
1/   Each project health center will be under the jurisdiction of a MHC and
will share responsibility for providing services and supervising sur-
rounding BHSs (the RHU structure is explained in para 2.47). In second
map, references to MHC should read "health centers".



- 32 -
3.29      Strengthening of MOR Logistics Network.  Partly because of financial
problems, the MOH has had considerable difficulty in keeping health facilities
adequately supplied with medicines and equipment. The first Bank project
provided equipment (worth about US$3 million) for MHCs and BHSs serving as
practice areas for in-service training programs. The project will include a
study of the MOH logistics system which will recommend: (a) the quantities
of medicines and other supplies required; (b) the required organization of
the logistics system, including revised staffing patterns at the center and
throughout the network; (c) the additional equipment (for maintenance and
warehouse handling) transport and physical infrastructure required, providing
equipment lists, specifications for procurement and schedules of accommodation
for any physical infrastructure recommended; and (d) specific terms of refer-
ence for the technical assistance that will be needed to make the system oper-
ational. The credit will also finance 26 person months of technical assis-
tance in the following areas: operational aspects of logistics (including
flows and channels, transport means, normal times and risks); equipment main-
tenance (to recommend organization of maintenance, a simple equipment inven-
tory system with continuous updating and cost control to identify repair/
replacement trade-offs, and training required); and communication systems
(to produce a feasibility study on the communications system for MOH, with
indication of present communication needs and usage and cost trade-offs
between use of public communications systems versus investment in a separate
MOH system).
3.30      Primary Health Care Schemes.  The primary health care component has
been planned utilizing various experiences within the Philippines. Recognizing
that community participation in health activities has been a crucial element
of most low cost health care programs that have been effective and efficient,
this program will be developed around the community with technical support
from the formal health system and it will be based on the use of local work-
ers. Barangay Health Workers (BHW) will be non-professional workers from the
barangay they are to serve. They will be suported by the barangay and account-
able to it. Training and technical support will come from the rural health
unit (as defined in para. 2.47). In existing programs of this type, tradi-
tional healers, hilots, or other health related workers such as the barangay
nutrition scholars, often have been chosen by the community to become BHWs;
this may be the case also in this component.
3.31      In the 12 provinces where this component will be implemented, it
should provide opportunities to test the effectiveness of different forms of
coordination and rationalization of the activities of several categories of
health-related barangay workers currently existing in different parts of the
Philippines (e.g. FTOWs, barangay nutrition scholars, private group health
workers). NEDA has organized an advisory technical committee formed by
representatives of several ministries (e.g. MOH, MLGCD, Ministry of Human
Settlements, etc.) to address this issue; the Committee will present recom-
mendations to NEDA's Social Development Council as a basis for a national
policy on primary health care. During negotiations, assurances were received
from the Government that it will develop and furnish the Association by April
30, 1981, a policy on primary health care which would set guidelines on the
use of barangay health workers including whether and how these cadres should
be paid.



- 33 -
3.32      The functions of BHWs will be determined by the needs and priorities
of each barangay. Each province will adapt the primary health care scheme to
its own needs. (Annex 5 presents the concept of primary health care.) The
program will be implemented by barangay development councils that in many
cases will ne d to be revitalized. Since the rural health unit is also
crucial for the success of the scheme, municipal health officers will be given
appropriate training during 1979 under the first project. UNICEF has agreed
to provide technical expertise and other necessary assistance to facilitate
the social preparation of communities. This will include a series of activi-
ties involving MLGCD, non-government groups, and the MOH. These activities
will be carried out as part of the regular program between the Government and
UNICEF and are not included in the project cost. The role of the central,
regional and provincial health levels will be one of general support through
the regular channels of administration. This component will be evaluated
through periodic survreys and regular reporting.
3.33      PHC schemes will be introduced in 12 provinces (one province per
region) in order to test the approach and provide a basis for developing
a national primary health care strategy. It is estimated that the total
population of the 12 provinces to be covered is 4.4 million, and that only 75%
of the barangays in those provinces are within the catchment areas of existing
health services and personnel (although not necessarily receiving any ser-
vices). The total number of people to be covered by the scheme is estimated
to be 3.3 million in 4,050 barangays.
3.34      The primary health care program should be supported by the community.
The project will accordingly provide each barangay with seed funds to start
income generating projects, and the profits will then be used to support the
local costs of the primary health care program, especially salaries of the
workers. The project will also provide seed funds to start cooperative vil-
lage level pharmacies (boticas), an approach that has already been tested
successfully in the Philippines.
Training of Health Personnel
3.35      As already mentioned (para. 2.51), MON in-service training needs to
be stepped up considerably in the next five years. This project will finance
a training of trainers program (initiated under the first project) for central
("master") trainers as well as for trainers at regional, provincial and
municipal levels, and a series of training programs for service managers, and
service providers in planning, management, IEC, and service skills.   Training
resources for family planning (consultants, resource personnel, trainers and
training materials) will be shared among all participating agencies, and in
particular between POPCOM and MOH.
3.36      The project will finance the following types of training for MOH
personnel (a detailed list is presented in Annex 2): (a) courses and work-
shops for trainers in planning, administration, evaluation/supervision, oper-
ational training methodology, management of training and promotion of team



- 34 -
work; (b) the training of selected municipal and barangay health staff who
in turn will teach lower-level health workers; (c) the training of directors
of regional training centers and of regional health planners in operational
planning, management and supervision of health services; (d) the training of
health staff in MIS implementation and utilization; and (e) the training and
refresher courses for appropriate service providers in IEC 1/ and such skills
as pill prescription, IUD insertion and sterilization. The IEC part of the
training component will enable to continue testing a scheme, initiated under
the first project, consisting of ways of utilizing informal leaders at the
neighborhood or Purok level as family planning multipliers. If proved suc-
cessful, the expansion of this approach may be proposed by MOH through the
category of "innovative activities".
3.37      The health training component will be implemented by OHEPT; while
the NFPO will be responsible for the family planning training sub-component
in close coordination with OHEPT. The project will finance the additional
personnel, travel, per diem, equipment and consultants needed to enable OHEPT
and NFPO to administer a considerably expanded training program. Two component
coordinators will be designated for this project: one in OHEPT and another in
NFPO. Training materials and audiovisual equipment are being provided under
the IEC component.
IEC for Health/Family Planning/Nutrition
3.38      IEC Objectives.  The health IEC program addresses the following
problem areas: poor nutrition, especially of mothers and children, and the
decline in breastfeeding; low family planning acceptance and continuation;
inadequate levels of immunization; high maternal and infant mortality; lack
of safe drinking water and poor sanitary waste disposal; and high prevalence
of certain communicable diseases. 2/
3.39      The MOH IEC program is based on the assumption that IEC is a funda-
mental part of the job of every frontline health worker. The health system
presents certain opportune settings for IEC that must be utilized to their
fullest: maternity wards, prenatal and postnatal clinics, nutriwards, mothers'
classes, mothercraft centers, and home visiting. Besides these settings within
MOH's field of operations, the IEC program will take advantage of other oppor-
tunities in the community and through the schools to reach parents, youth, and
various leadership groups. In this effort MOH will cooperate with a number of
other agencies--governmental and non-governmental, including in particular
POPCOM.
1/   Additional MOH staff will be trained in IEC as part of an Expanded
Program for Immunization being supported by a UNICEF grant.
2/   These priorities and other elements of the IEC plan were developed
by the planning team that consisted of health education staff and
representatives of five key MOH bureaus/offices; its work was based
on a careful analysis of the health plan and other relevant data.



- 35 -
3.40      Specific Component Objectives.  The thrust of the IEC component
is to strengthen the critical face-to-face communication carried out by MOH
field staff and volunteers by increasing the capacity of the MOH to design,
produce and distribute IEC materials; to supervise field staff in IEC; and to
evaluate IEC activities. The training component will provide training in more
advanced IEC skills for field staff.
3.41      Materials Development/Design/Production.  The project will provide
equipment and personnel to set up a print production section in MOH's IEC
unit. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that
by December 31, 1979, it will employ a suitably qualified chief of this unit.
In-house production will be complemented with contracted production of IEC
materials. Remodeling of MOH space for a print shop is included in the project.
3.42      IEC Supporting Structure.  To support the IEC efforts of field staff
and the design and production of IEC materials, the project will provide (for
detailed listing, see Annex 3): (a) sixteen professional and technical staff
in the central unit to operate the print production section, manage the mass
media program, design and develop basic printed materials, and conduct pretest-
ing; (b) an Assistant Regional Health Education Advisor helped by an AV
Technician-cum-Driver, in each of the 12 regions (outside Metro Manila); and
(c) one Provincial Health Educator in each of forty provinces that have no IEC
specialists.   During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that
appropriate IEC staff will be employed by December 31, 1980.
3.34      The training component will provide IEC training for all new Provin-
cial Health Educators and for all old and new IEC specialists in appropriate
IEC skills. In addition, the project includes financing of fellowships, and
travel and per diem for supervision of IEC activities. A total of 2.5 years
of consultant time will be provided to assist in the establishment of the
production unit, for a mass media support program, for the evaluation of key
activities, and for other critical operational activities. (It is expected
that WHO will provide other IEC consultants and fellowships). The project
will provide three vehicles for the central health education/IEC unit, one
AV van for each of the 12 Regional Health Offices, a pool of basic AV
equipment for each of the 76 Provincial Health Offices, and AV kits for the
health centers.
3.44      Health Education/IEC Research and Evaluation:  With the help of
consultants, MOH will evaluate key aspects of the IEC program. A consultant
will help the MOH to draw up an IEC research and evaluation program. With
project funds, MOH will conduct periodic evaluations of the impact of the
IEC program. Appropriate baseline data will be collected early in the project
period; subsequent final data will be collected and analyzed in time to guide
the periodic planning of activities.
Management Information System
3.45      The MOH/MIS component of this project has as main objectives:  (a)
making fully operational the MOH/MIS established through the first project;
(b) assisting the National Nutrition Council to develop and computerize the
nutrition surveillance system; and (c) helping to set up an integrated MIS by
inter-linking the MOH, POPCOM and the National Nutrition Council MIS systems.



- 36 -
3.46      This component will be implemented by the MOH/MIS unit and the
National Nutrition Council, concerning health and nutrition MIS respectively.
The project provides funds for data processing equipment and computer hardware,
computer time until hardware is acquired, additional technical staff, 6 per-
son-months of technical assistance to undertake periodic evaluations of the
system's effectiveness and 11 person-months of overseas fellowships for
advanced study in data management and processing. The project also includes
funds for training locally MOH staff (under training component) so that they
can cooperate effectively in data gathering, transmission of reports, and
utiliz2t-inn of data oUtput.
3.47      The project will also finance the development of the MIS of the
National Nutrition Council to enable the operation of its nutrition sur-
veillance system. This system has been designed to provide a number of early
warning signals or indicators of malnutrition. At the municipal level, the
system collects the following information: percent of newborn with low birth
weight; number of children per 1,000 who had diarrhea during the last month,
number of children per 1,000 with night blindness; number of children per
1,000 who died from all causes in the last month; percent of second and third
degree malnourished pre-school children; and percent of second and third
degree malnourished pupils. The system is only operating in areas where
nutrition scholars are working.
3.48      In order to expand this system over the whole country, it is neces-
sary to link it for data collection purposes, with the health and population
MISs. A feasibility study of an integrated system is beinig financed under the
first population project. The present project will provide financing for the
development of the integrated system, on the basis of this study. Another
study is being conducted with funds from the first project to assess the
hardware needs of the three MIS systems at MOH, POPCOM and the National
Nutrition Council.
Innovative Activities in Health Care and Family Planning
3.49      For health and family planning, US$1,100,000 will be allocated to
Part B of the project to finance high priority innovative activities which may
arise during the course of project implementation. Examples of areas that may
need support with these funds are special management studies , special surveys
complementing the management information system, studies on PHC, or further
expansion of project components such as the Purok leader approach.   Government
proposals for utilization of these funds will be subject to the same care and
scrutiny by the Association, as devoted to the appraisal of the other project
components. To obtain the Association's approval, such proposals will have to
meet the criteria listed in para. 3.23. Approval of these proposals will be
a condition of disbursement against this category (para. 7.03).

IV. PROJECT COST, FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENT
A. Cost
4.01      The total estimated project cost is US$72 million equivalent, of
which US$24.2 million, or 34%, is foreign exchange. The foreign exchange
component has been calculated assuming 30% for construction, 30% for furni-
ture, 100% for equipment, 87% for special equipment, 60% for vehicles, 55%
for advisory services, studies and fellowships, and 50% for TEC contracts
and innovative activities. Project cost estimates by expenditure categories
are summarized in the following table:

4.02      The costs of construction, furniture and equipment have been esti-
mated using October 1978 prices and are based on MOH experience with similar
construction under the first Bank project. Cost estimates for special equip-
ment, vehicles, materials and IEC production are based on recent price quota-
tions. About 4% of the project's total cost are salaries and honoraria for
incremental staff; these have been costed according to standard Government
schedules. Other capital costs have been estimated as follows: (a) for
consultants/local advisory services, US$1,000 per month; foreign advisory
services, US$5,000 per month; (b) for fellowships for study abroad, US$1,500
per person-month, and for fellowships for study in the Philippines, US$250 per
person-month. These figures include all expenses.
4.03      The contingency allowance of US$12.8 million includes:  (a) physical
contingencies for unforeseen factors, estimated at 10% of base civil works
costs and professional fees; and (b) price contingencies averaging 19% of
the base cost plus physical contingencies. Price contingencies were calculated
on the basis of the project expenditure schedule and on the assumptions that:
(a) local wages for civil works will increase by 10% yearly and prices of
local construction materials by 6%, resulting in an average construction
cost increase of 7% per year up to 1984; (b) all other salaries, maintenance
costs, and the cost of IEC materials will increase by 6% per year; and (c)
prices of all imported goods will increase by 6% annually during the project
period.

4.05      Government current expenditures for health, population and nutrition
in FY78 amounted to about P 1,096 million or 3.2% of the total national budget
in FY79.  The project would add about P 7 million at 1978 prices to MOH's
annual current expenditures (or 6.5% of total MOH current expenditures) and
P 15 million to POPCOM's annual current expenditures (or 8% of total POPCOM
current expenditures) in 1985 after completion of the project. The increase
seems reasonable in view of the priority assigned by the Government to these
programs and the considerable expansion of services included under the project.
The Government has agreed to assume financing of all ongoing activities
initiated under the project when it is completed.
4.06      The operating costs originating in the project, including price
contingencies, are as follows:

B. Proposed Financing
4.07      The proposed five-year project would be financed by an Association
credit of US$A0 million equivalent, which excludestaxes, and a contribution
from the Gov:-nment of the Philippines of US$32 million equivalent.  UNICEF's
contribution for social preparation of communities under the primary health
care component of the project will be part of the regular agreement between of
that agency and the Government; it has not been included in the project cost
(financing plan, Annex 7). Total IDA financing would cover the foreign
exchange cost of US$24.2 million equivalent and US$15.8 million equivalent of
the local cost.
4.08.     The credit would be on standard terms.  Details of the disbursement
plan are given in Annex 8.
4.09      The tight budgetary situation of the Philippines makes it appro-
priate that part of the credit should be used to finance local costs in order
to enable a considerable expansion of the national health services and of the
population program. It is proposed that the Association finance 50% of the
per diem allowances and travel costs for training courses, workshops, and
supervision, which are incremental operating expenditures.
4.10      The salaries of regular employees of the Government agencies parti-
cipating in this project, who are to be hired especially for project activi-
ties, or for project administration are part of the project cost and will be
financed entirely by the Government.  The Government will continue to employ
the new staff after the project is completed.
C. Disbursements and Accounts
4.11      Disbursements by IDA against project expenditures will be as follows:
for civil works, 50%; for furniture, equipment, special equipment and vehicles,
100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of ex-factory cost or 65% of locally pro-
cured items; for advisory services, professional fees, studies, fellowships,
seed money and materials, 100%; for IEC contracts and travel and per diem,
50%; and for innovative activities, 50%.
4.12      POPCOM and MOH will maintain separate accounts for the incremental
operating expenditures (travel and per diem)of their respective parts (A and
B) of the project. Reimbursements from the Association for these expenditures
will be made against standard documentation. In addition, they should be
supported by documentation clearly specifying: the name of the course, work-
shop, or type of supervision assignment, date, and the names and agency of
those receiving payment. Disbursements for construction carried out by force
account will be made against certified statements of expenditures which should
include a record of expenditures incurred during the reporting period, explana-
tion on the form of implementation of construction, administering party and
breakdown of expenditures. The statement should be certified by the Finance
Division of the Ministry of Health and the auditor (details in Annex 11).
POPCOM and MOH finance units will retain until one year after the Closing



- 42 -
Date of the credit, all records pertaining to such expenditures and will allow
representatives of the Association to examine such records at any time.
During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government that it will
cause POPCOM and MOH to have their accounts and financial statements related
to the project for each fiscal year audited by independent auditors acceptable
to the Association. Auditing of the accounts of the first project in some
cases has been unable to distinguish between expenditures for authorized
project purposes and those for other health activities. Similar problems have
occurred in POPCOM in connection with other externally financed projects.
Therefore, further to the above mentioned assurance, during negotiations, an
understanding was reached with the Government to the effect that it would
request its Commission an Audit to engage consultants to assist in improving
the annual audit of this project, particularly if the Association finds that
such improvement is necessary in the future. The Government agreed to furnish
the Association a certified copy of the report of such audit not later than
six months after the end of each fiscal year.
V.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND RISKS
A. Project Management
5.01      Realistically, it will be many years before the health and popula-
tion programs of the Philippines are fully developed to cover all the popula-
tion with consistently high quality services. A significant beginning has
been made toward this goal and the proposed project is intended to build
upon that base. Because these are major ongoing programs it is not feasible
to have all important decisions taken before committing additional funds.
The actions which have been agreed by the Government and which are shown as
conditions of the credit are timed to take place as soon as preparatory work
will permit.
5.02      Part A of the IDA project will be implemented by POPCOM and part
B, by MOH. The administration and implementation of each part will be the
separate responsibility of the respective agencies (Annex 9 provides functions
and responsibilities for all project staff). The project has been designed to
complement the programs of each agency, emphasizing the strengthening of the
institutions at the same time that incremental activities are undertaken as
part of the project. The complexity of the project will necessitate the
preparation, each year, of a detailed work plan for each project component.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that it will
cause POPCOM and MOH to provide the Association, for consultation, a copy of
the annual work plans for PHC, training, IEC, MIS, research, and construction
and procurement (segregating project and non-project activities) not later
than September 30 of each of the five project years; the first such submission
should be not later than September 30, 1979 (Annex 10 presents project imple-
mentation timetables).
5.03      The overall responsibility for planning and coordinating the
Philippine population program rests with POPCOM. Several agencies of the
Government are responsible for implementing various program components, the
most important being MOH for the delivery of family planning services. The



- 43 -
responsibility for public health services rests entirely with MOH. Important
project activities are aimed at strengthening the capability of POPCOM and MOH
to discharge their responsibilities.
Part A: POPCOM Project Management
5.04      During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that by December
31, 1979, it will designate appropriate senior staff in consultation with the
Association, to implement Part A of the project including a project coordinator
and an assistant in the office of the Executive Director and associate direc-
tors as component coordinators. Each will be helped by one assistant. Also,
an understanding was reached with the Government that the Chiefs of MIS and
research will be appointed assistant coordinators for the MIS and research
components respectively.
5.05      For handling funds under Part A, POPCOM's organization for finan-
cial matters requires realignment. Until recently, POPCOM's financial organi-
zation was fragmented as a result of the creation, in the past, of several
separate finance units to handle funds from different external sources.
During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government that it
will place all financial operations of Part A of the project under the Finance
Division of POPCOM and that it will ensure suitable accountability of project
funds by designing and adopting, by December 31, 1979 an accounting system
acceptable to the Association. Furthermore, an understanding was reached to
the effect that the Government will engage consultants in the design of the
accounting system. The project also includes financing of 18 person-months
of consultants in accounting systems and procedures, for POPCOM's Finance
Division. All budgeting, accounting, and disbursement functions in POPCOM,
including those related to the project, will be placed under a chief budget
officer, a chief accountant, and a treasurer, respectively. To assist in
project related work, the Finance Division of POPCOM may be augmented with
one budgeting, one accounting and one disbursement officer if required.
Financial reports will be prepared quarterly and annually following functional
andh expenditure category breakdowns required by the Association.
5.06      The Executive Director of POPCOM will submit quarterly and annual
reports to the POPCOM Board and IDA on project progress. Technical coordina-
tion of project components within POPCOM will be undertaken by a working
committee headed by the Project Coordinator for Part A and consisting of all
Part A component coordinators. Other POPCOM central and regional staff will
be invited to participate in meetings as required.
Part B: MOH Project Management
5.07      The Government gave assurances during negotiations that it will
designate appropriate senior staff, in consultation with the Association, to
implement Part B of the project, including a project coordinator in the Office
of the Minister of Health in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to the



- 44 -
Association, and consistent with normal Government practice. The Government
also gave assurances that it would designate project component coordinators
in the relevant bureaus and offices of MOH.  The General Services Division
will handle the logistics component and procurement under this project.
5.08      Construction under the project (both for POPCOM and MOH) will be
implemented by an MOH Construction Unit which would be placed under the
Project Coordinator for Part B. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from the Government that, by December 31, 1979, it will appoint a chief for
the construction unit. (see para. 5.13).
5.09      Separate books of accounts for the project will be maintained by
MOH's Finance Division of the Financial and Management Service. It would
take long to modify the present complex system, with its 20 independent sets
of accounts so as to avoid creating a new and separate set of records. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that for this
project, it will make MOH's Financial and Management Service responsible for
handling all financial matters related to Part B of the project, and it will
cause it to design and adopt an accounting system acceptable to the Associa-
tion, by December 31, 1979. As in the case of POPCOM, the Government and
the Association reached an understanding to the effect that the former will
engage consultants in the design of the accounting system. The project also
includes financing of 18 person-months of consultants in accounting systems
and procedures, for MOH's Finance Division. To help carry out budgeting,
accounting and disbursement functions for the project, one budgeting, one
accounting and one disbursing officer may be added if required. The Service
will submit quarterly and annual financial reports, following the breakdown by
functional categories, sub-classified by expenditure category, as required by
the Association.
5.10      The Project Coordinator for Part B will submit quarterly and annual
progress reports, based on the component progress reports, to the Minister of
Health and to the Association. Technical coordination of project components
within MOH will be undertaken by a working committee chaired by the Deputy
Minister consisting of the Project Coordinator for Part B and all Part B
component coordinators. Other MOH central and regional staff and officers from
other agencies will be invited to attend meetings as required. Project Working
Committees A and B will hold joint meetings at least semi-annually, under
rotating chairmanship to discuss project matters. Individual component
coordinators from POPCOM and MOH will meet more often, as required, to dis-
cuss specific components.
5.11      Financial support to project management will include salaries for
the required additional coordinating staff. These, as well as the salaries
of the additional staff to be engaged in various MOH divisions/bureaus/offices
for project work have been included in the project cost as incremental operat-
ing costs. A total of 31.4 person-years of advisory services have been also
included in various components of Parts A and B to assist in project imple-
mentation. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will
cause POPCOM and MOH to employ consultants whose qualifications, experience
and terms and conditions of employment will be satisfactory to the Association.



- 45 -
B. Implementation of the Physical Facilities
5.12      A construction unit (mentioned in para 5.08) will serve both MOH's
Part B and, in a contractor/client relationship, POPCOM's Part A. The unit
will report to both Part A and Part B Project Coordinators, on their respec-
tive construction components.  It will be headed by the construction unit
chief supported by two assistants (one architect and one civil engineer).
Other engineers and draftsmen will be employed from time to time according
to the changing workload. In particular, one sanitary engineer and one
electrical engineer will be engaged temporarily to help prepare bid documents.
5.13      The chief of the construction unit will coordinate and supervise
the design, construction and commissioning of buildings. To this end he will:
(a) select and appoint the executive architects, engineers and construction
management consultants, with qualifications, experience and terms and condi-
tions of employment satisfactory to the Association, and brief them as appro-
priate; (b) assist in timely selection and acquisition of suitable sites
according to agreed criteria; (c) review and revise the executive architect's
design and working plans, cost estimates and bid documents and ascertain that
the users' requirements will be satisfactorily met; (d) invite and evaluate
bids for civil works, award contracts and arrange for community participation
in construction; (e) set up a cost control and reporting mechanism, and help
the Finance Division operate a system for making payments and for reimburse-
ments to barangay councils; (f) coordinate with users' representatives and
Parts A and B procurement coordinators procurement of furniture and equipment
for the project facilities; (g) assist the executive architects in the pre-
paration and production of a manual for the use and maintenance of buildings
and equipment; and (h) submit quarterly and annual progress reports, and
project completion reports to the respective coordinators for Parts A and B of
the project.
5.14      The construction of POPCOM's 13 regional office buildings and/or
warehouses and garages will follow the usual procedures. Under the construc-
tion unit's guidance the executive architects will design the buildings;
contracts will be awarded to contractors after bidding and evaluation. The
construction management consultants will supervise the contractor's work,
issue payment certificates and accept the completed buildings.
5.15      The largest civil works package consists of 75 health centers in
towns of 19 provinces selected for their low level of health infrastructure
availability. Although an attempt will be made to attract local contractors
by preparing small bid packages, it is likely that many of the facilities
located in small and remote towns will not attract acceptable bids. In such
cases, construction may be implemented by the MLGCD using force account.
Construction of all health centers will be supervised by the construction
management consultants. BHSs are very simple structures staffed by one
midwife. For their construction, the project will introduce the following
alternative procedures:



- 46 -
(a) communities wishing to undertake construction by themselves
would be provided with prototype designs, materials, tools
and a simple construction manual; they would be assisted by
barangay development workers to organize themselves; their
construction work would be supervised by the municipal sanitary
inspector (MOH) jointly with the municipal engineer (MLGCD);
they would report using simple performance certificates; BHS
construction would have also occasional supervision from the
construction management consultants (about three times: once
before construction work starts, once during construction
(walls/roof) and once towards completion); and the respective
barangay development council would receive a monetary payment
for labor contributed upon completion of construction, to be
used by the council in another developmental project that would
benefit the community;
(b) in communities where members wish to contribute only partially
to the construction of their BHS, the work would be undertaken
by the MLGCD using force account and the community would be
compensated in proportion to the manpower contributed; the
construction management consultants would supervise the work
2-3 times; or
(c) in communities which do not wish to take any part in the
work, no construction will take place unless there are good
reasons for this attitude, in which case BHSs may be built
by MLGCD using force account (of course, no payment would be
given to the community in this case).
5.16      The evaluation of a pilot component of the first population project--
the building of 25 BHSs with community participation--should provide useful
information for implementing this component.
5.17      The action plan for BHS construction includes an information campaign
to stimulate community participation and provide details about procedures for
applying. The MLGCD, with the assistance of the construction unit in MOH,
will carry out these information campaigns in the identified project provinces,
by utilizing the regular contacts of barangay development workers with communi-'
ties and the monthly "Barangay Letter." These campaigns will explain the
advantages of a BHS, how the community can participate in its construction,
and the system of payments.
5.18      MOH's construction unit has developed three prototype BHS designs
which communities are testing in the pilot scheme. It is also preparing a
simple construction manual to guide communities on technical details.
C. Procurement
5.19      To the extent practicable, contracts for furniture, equipment, spe-
cial equipment, vehicles, materials for in-house TEC production, materials
for training and research, and contracts for mass production of IEC materials



- 47 -
will be grouped in appropriate packages of not less than US$80,000 equivalent.
Such contracts estimated to cost US$80,000 or more will be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement; contracts estimated to cost less than US$80,000
equivalent, but not exceeding US$800,000 equivalent in total, will be procured
on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with
Government procedures which were discussed during negotiations and were found
acceptable to the Association; such procedures include, inter alia, that
bidders shall be prequalified.
5.20      To allow for reasonable flexibility, contracts for smaller items
costing not more than US$8,000 but not exceeding US$200,000 equivalent in
total and any contract for the supply of tools and materials for constructing
BHSs will be procured on the basis of prudent shopping after inviting quota-
tions from at least three suppliers.
5.21      A preference margin of 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported goods
or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is lower, will be extended to
eligible local manufacturers when comparing evaluated bids obtained through
international competitive bidding.
5.22      Where reasonable, civil works will be grouped in appropriate bid
packages on the basis of geographical locations by region or province as
suitable. Of the $16.0 million civil works of the project, $8.5 million are
estimated for over 900 BHS in remote areas to be built by the communities
themselves. The remaining $7.5 million for some 100 buildings in 90 loca-
tions spread over all 13 regions would not attract foreign contractors to
participate in bidding. Therefore civil works contracts will be awarded
after local bidding in accordance with Government procedures acceptable to
the Association (para 5.19). Foreign contractors will not be excluded from
bidding and all contractors who participate in bidding will be required to
have prequalified.
5.23      In cases where no reasonable bids are obtained, or where communities--
in exceptional cases--are unable to implement part of the construction work of
health centers or BHSs, it will be implemented by force account by the Ministry
of Local Government and Community Development. Reporting and accounting
procedures to handle force account payments are explained in Annex 11.
5.24      Contracts for consultants and advisory services (i.e., for designing
and supervising construction and civil works; for carrying out studies, for
designing prototypes and producing IEC materials) will be awarded following
the guidelines and procedures in the latest edition of "Uses of Consultants by
the World Bank and its Borrowers."
D. Flow of Funds
5.25      The project will contribute to the objectives of the Five-Year
Development Plan, 1978-82 which has Presidential sanction. The Ministry of
the Budget has given assurances to Association missions that it will provide
yearly budgetary allocations for this project. The project areas--rural
health, population, and nutrition--constitute high priority sectors for the



- 48 -
Government. Both POPCOM and MOH have already submitted budget requests
for the first year of the project--CY1980--in time for consideration by the
National Assembly in May 1979. The Ministry of the Budget will approve cash
disbursement ceilings in the annual budgets of POPCOM and MOH covering both
the national contribution and the counterpart of the IDA Credit; in this
manner, delays caused by lack of funds to pay contractors and suppliers,
as in the past project, should not occur.
5.26      The Finance Division of POPCOM, suitably reorganized (para. 5.05)
will administer Part A fundse MOH's Financial and Mlanagement Service will
handle Part B financial matters (para. 5.09). In both cases, the account-
ability of project funds will be ensured by suitable accounting systems, being
designed with the assistance of consultants and the provision of financial
consultants during project implementation. Claims for reimbursement from the
Association will be handled separately for Parts A and B by the respective
finance offices of POPCOM and MOH.
E. Risks
5.27      The risks involved in this project are mainly related to the success
or failure of high Government authorities to provide strong support to the
organizational changes and managerial and technical upgrading which have been
agreed upon by the GOP and the Association as necessary conditions--both in
POPCOM and MOH--for successful implementation of the health and population
programs. There are, however, favorable signs that such support will be
forthcoming. High Government officials have repeatedly stated that primary
health care, population and nutrition have high priority for the national
development efforts. More specifically, a functional analysis of the Ministry
of Health, financed under the first project, which should lead to revision of
its present organization, is already underway. The improvements required in
POPCOM, consisting of upgrading salary levels and managerial and technical
capabilities of the staff have already begun; this improvement process should
be followed up carefully to prevent any recurrence of past problems. The
streamlining and strengthening of the professional staff should not be diffi-
cult, given the availability of qualified professionals in the Philippines and
the strong staff development program included in the project.
5.28      Another risk that should not be ignored relates to the community
participation approach to be tested in two components of this project--BHS
construction and primary health care. Problems and constraints surrounding
this approach were recognized and carefully weighed during project conceptuali-
zation and design; it was concluded that the potential benefits in terms of
increased community outreach and increased possibilities for providing services
affordable to the Government made such a risk worthwhile. Several safeguards
have been built in the design of these components to minimize the risks; among
them there is the involvement of the MLGCD for their direct access to local
governments; the participation of UNICEF for their technical support to social



- 49 -
preparation activities and their provision of a bridge between the Government
and the private sector in these activities; and the provision for continued
evaluation. During negotiations, the Government confirmed that a policy on
pri-viry health care, presently being developed by an interministerial committee,
will be made available to the Association by April 30, 1981.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The attainment of the national targets to increase the proportion
of couples practicing contraception from 27% now to 50% in 1987 and the ex-
pected consequent decline sought in the annual average rate of growth of the
population from 2.5% in 1978 to 2.1% in 1987 and 1.6% in 2000 (para. 2.09)
will require a considerably expanded, intenisified and more effective program
effort.  The health sector goals (paragraph 2.40) of reductions in infant
mortality, malnutrition among pre-school children, and morbidity frol priority
communicable diseases will be very difficult to achieve unless health services
are extended during the next decade to the one-third of the population not
now served. The project would contribute significantly to an increase in
the scope and depth of the population and the health prograTTs.  ITn 1982 the
project would provide 20% of the cost of the population program and 23% of
that of the health program.
6.02      It is not possible to estimate the numbers of births and deaths
that will be averted directly as a result of this project. However, partial
contributions would be the provision of both types of services to an addi-
tional 3.3 million persons with the primary health care scheme, and another 3
million persons with services from new health facilities. Altogether, these
two components would reach about 40% of the population now outside the reach
of adequate health services. The project strategy of combining strengthening
of the formal health system and supporting a phased introduction of primary
health care schemes may have synergistic effects of considerable importance
in terms of maximizing the yields of those two efforts. Since primary health
care will be introduced in one province only in each of the twelve regions,
there will be opportunities for comparing the effects of r combtined" vis-a-vis
"formal system-only" inputs to the health services. A novel aspect oF this
project is the emphasis placed during its co'icOtrtialization on identifying
ways of eliciting the involvement of the community in recognizing, understand-
ing, and practicing sound health principles making individuals and communities
take major responsibility for their own health. Community participatLoni w[l
be emphasized in the following project compoolents: primary health care
schemes, construction of barangay health stations, IEC, and training. There
is provision in the project Lor evaluating the various approaches to service
delivery through the regular MISs, pre-testing of IEC materials, and special
st-idies to be undertaken by consultants.
6.03      Besides increasing the coverage of health, family planning and
nutrition ser\Ttceo, the project would be a major contributing factor in
improving their quality through: more functional organizations; the massive
la--;,rvice training programs which would be prteceded by systematic development



- 50 -
of trainers; the overhauling and expansion of the logistis :;:tems; the
unprecedented nationwide public sensitization and educational campaigns; the
support of program relevant researchi; and the further development of data
systems for management and evaluation.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the G^overnment
to the effect that it will:
(a)  cause POPCOM to complete the population plan and iake if
available to the Association for its review and comment by
December 31, 1979; by March 31, 1980 the Government will
consult with the Association on a timetable for implementation
of such plan (para. 2.07);
(b)  cause POPCOM and MOH to reach an agreement on conliplementarity
between population field workers and the clinic services under
the population program not later than Decembh-r 31, 1979 (para.

(c) cause POPCOM and MOH to provide the Association, for review
and comment, a copy of the annual plans for PuG., IEG, training,
MIS, research, construction and procurement (segregating
project and non-project activities) not later than                TOe:t 1er ,,
of each of the five project years; the first such submission
should be not later than September 30, 1979 (para. 5.02);
(d) cause POPCOM to take the necessary steps to improve its finan-
cial and administrative operations and to easulre an effective
coordination of the execution of Part A of the project, in-
cluding strengthening of its staff with such additional
appointments as will be agreed upon between the Governt'tuiii
and the Association, and undertaking such actions as described
in paras. 2.14, 3.16, 3.21, 3.22, 5.04, and 5.05;
(e) cause POPCOM to undertake a review of the IEC distribution
system and convey to the Association, 'by Ocrolhoc 31, 10980,
the recommendations arising from such review (para. 3.15);
(f) cause MOH to take all necessary measures to ensure an effec-
tive coordinatLion in the execution of Part B of the project,
including making such additional appointments as agreed upon
between the Government and the Association, and undertaking
such actions as described in paras. 3.26, 3.41, 3.42, 5.07
and 5.08;



- 51 -
(g) cause MOH to provide the Association, by December 31, 1979, the
results of the functional analysis study of the health services
and to consult with the Association, by April 30, 1980, on a
timetable for implementation of the recommendations arising
from this study (para. 2.50);
(h) cause POPCOM to place all financial operations of Part A of
the project, under its Finance Division and to design and adopt
by December 31, 1979, an accounting system acceptable to the
Association to handle project funds (para. 5.05);
(i) cause MOH to place all financial matters related to Part B
of the project under its Financial and Management Service
and design and, adopt, by December 31, 1979, an accounting
system acceptable to the Association to handle project funds
(para. 5.09);
(j) cause POPCOM and MOH to have the project accounts and finan-
cial statements related to the project fiscal year audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association and furnish
the Association a certified copy of the report of such audit
not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year
(para. 4.12); and
(k) develop a policy on primary health care, including the use
of barangay health workers, and make such policy available
to the Association by April 30, 1981 (para 5.28).
7.02      Also during negotiations the following understandings were reached
with the Government to the effect that:
(a) the Government plans to engage consultants to assist with the
design of accounting systems for POPCOM and MOH, in accordance
with terms of reference concurred upon with the Association
(paras. 5.05 and 5.09); and
(b) the Government would be prepared to ask its Commission on Audit
to engage consultants to assist in improving the audit of the
project, particularly if the Association finds that such
improvement is necessary in the future (para. 4.12).
7.03      For activities to be financed under the innovative activities
component of both Parts A and B of the project, no funds will be disbursed
unless the Association has approved the activity before its implementation,
according to the criteria listed in para. 3.23.
7.04      Subject to the above assurances and understandings, the project
is recommended for an IDA credit of US$40 million equivalent on standard
terms, to the Government of the Philippines.

PHILIPPINES POPULATION PROJECT II
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IEC COMPONENT
A. A Summary of the Communications Environment in the
PhilipDines with Reference to PoDulation and Health IEC
The IEC plans that were developed during project preparation are
in part based on assessments of what various audiences need to know or be
motivated to do in order to meet the country's population and health goals.
Another important consideration in the development of both plans (with spe-
cial reference to the IEC materials that are to be produced) is the com-
munications environment, i.e., what media exist, how accessible they are,
and to what extent people attend to them. In this regard, the following
points have been particularly relevant:
(a)   Language.  Although there are a large number of dialects, just
five represent the mother tongue of over three-quarters of the
population. The national language, Pilipino, which is based on
Tagalog, is widely spoken, and to a lesser extent English is
also since it is used for instruction in certain subjects in
the schools. Pilipino and English are especially widely spoken
in urban areas.
(b)   Literacy.  The literacy rate is very high for a developing
country--over 85% nationwide--although several regions, part-
icularly in the south, have somewhat lower rates (70% or less).
(c)   Radio.  There are about 260 radio stations, including about 15
operated by the Government. Well over half the households in
the country own a radio. About three-quarters of a sample of
family planning acceptors said they listen daily, with dramatic
and musical programs being most popular.l/
(d)   Newspapers.  Daily newspapers are concentrated in Manila, where
they have a circulation of over one million, whereas most of the
nearly 50 provincial papers are weeklies with small circulations.
About 35% of the family planning acceptors interviewed indicated
they read a paper at least once or twice a week.
(e)   Magazines.  Magazines are more widely read than newspapers,
especially ones with pictorial stories known locally as "komiks,"
which are very popular with adults including those with a college
education. There are about 20 major magazines and another 50
1/ These and subsequent figures on the media habits of family planning acceptors
are taken from Jose R. Lacson, Jr. et al., Family Planning Motivators in the
Philippines: A Nationwide Composite Profile, 2 vols., August 1977, Manila:
University of the Philippines Institute of Mass Communication and POPCOM.

Philippines with Reference to Population and Health IEC (cont.)
"komiks" magazines. About a million copies of the latter are
sold each week. Nearly half of the sample of FP acceptors said
they read at least one "komik" magazine a week and about one-
third read at least one regular magazine a week.
(f) Cinema. A very active movie industry produces about 200 films
a year for the 900 cinemas in the country. About 15% of the
family planning acceptors attend the cinema at least once a month.
(g) Television. Of the 15 television channels, four are in Manila.
There are about five million viewers in the country, but they
are almost all urban and middle class. Television is a rapidly
developing medium, however, and within five years it is expected
that inexpensive, locally made receivers will be on the market.
About 15% of the family planning acceptors were exposed to tele-
vision daily.
(h)  The unexposed minority.  In spite of the high levels of exposure
to the mass media, there is a significant minority with little or
no exposure. Typically, of course, they are poorer, less well
educated, more geographically isolated, and more in need of family
planning and health services than the average Filipino. Indicative
of the magnitude of this unexposed group are the figures from the
study of family planning acceptors (although they obviously under-
state the problem): 12% never listen to the radio, 30% never read
a newspaper; 30% never read a magazine or "komik," over 25% never
attend the cinema, and about 60% never watch television. (This is
added reason for stressing in the project the role of interpersonal
communication through various fieldworker cadres as they can, with
proper stimulus, reach the people who are not touched by the mass
media.)

PHILIPPINES POPULATION PROJECT II
PRIMARY HEALTH CARE COMPONENT
1.        In developing countries the insufficiency of basic health
services results in considerable suffering and death from preventable
diseases. Communicable diseases claim many lives of children and adults
in the economically productive age group. In the Philippines, tuberculosis,
gastroenteritis, malaria, respiratory infections, viral infections and
intestinal parasitic diseases are highly prevalent among low income
groups. Some of the important causative factors are malnutrition, poor
environment and multiple pregnancies too close to one another resulting
in underweight babies.
2.        The present development efforts of the Government, as embodied
in Presidential Decree No. 1200, are directed toward improving the lives
of the rural population. Towards this end, the expansion of the basic
health and medical care services in these areas is of crucial importance.
As a first step, starting in 1974, the Government adopted and implemented
a new approach to health service delivery--the Restructured Health Care
Delivery System (RHCDS)1/. The implementation of the RHCDS under the
Bank-financed Population Project I is to be completed by the end of 1979.
However, an operations research study in five provinces of the country
has shown that even with the full implementation of the RHCDS, only 47
percent of the community's health needs could be met. Those persons
living outside the reach of the health facilities (more than 3 kms) are
not covered even though midwives have been retrained to make more
efficient use of their time.
3.        It has been pointed out that the competing traditional health
services and the existing cultural norms and values of the community
contribute substantially to the underutilization of existing health services.
In this light, the government's wish to provide services to peripheral
villages would need a complementary move originating from the community.
The key, therefore, is to achieve, with the assistance of non-professional
community workers, known as Barangay Health Workers (BHW), community
participation in the solution of individual and collective health problems.
4.        The participation of non-professional workers in the delivery
of health care, family planning and nutrition services to the community
is not a new idea. It has been increasingly adopted by both developed
and developing countries as a strategy to improve conditions, especially in
areas where the outreach of Government services is inadequate mainly due
to lack of resources and/or poor community response. Countries such as the
Peoples' Republic of China with their "barefoot doctors", Latin American
1/ RHCDS is an integrated approach to health delivery services focusing
on preventive health care, family planning and nutrition, under which
functions have been redistributed among the health team members,
giving more responsibilities to lower level personnel.

PRIMARY HEALTH CARE COMPONENT (cont.)
countries with their "auxiliares de enfermeria", African countries with
their "medical assistance" are examples of responses to community needs
according to particular situations. A favorable impact on the communities
has been achieved through these strategies mainly because the non-
professional community worker is able to bridge effectively the wide
cultural gap between the people and the modern frontiers of care. This
is especially demonstrated when traditional healers and indigenous
midwives after appropriate training, are included in the health team.
These traditional health workers, sharing values and attitudes of the
community at large more strongly than the providers of modern health
care, become potent decision leaders and innovators one properly
motivated and trained.
5.        Equally important to consider, however, is that even ordinary
laymen (inhabitants and residents of the village or community other than
traditional healers) can be harnessed effectively to become health workers.
They provide the necessary link to make modern practices more acceptable
to the community, and give the professional health workers a clearer
understanding of community needs to solve their own problems more
effectively.
6.        Applying the concept of primary health care, lf essential health
services are made universally accessible to individuals and families in the
community by means acceptable to them, with their full participation.
There are several primary health care projects in the Philippines con-
ducted both by Government and private agencies. These projects were
extensively reviewed in a series of seminars conducted during the visit
of the IDA Appraisal Mission to the Philippines in October 1978, and
also by a WHO conducted field review. Utilizing these experiences, a
primary health care component is being proposed as part of the second
population project for pilot testing in twelve provinces--one in each of
the country's twelve regions. It should be emphasized that the proposed
component, while developed from Philippines experiences, is still subject
to revision at the municipal level to enable individual municipalities to
make adaptations to the program depending upon their local needs and
conditions.
7.        The BHW will be a non-professional health worker residing in
the barangay he/she serves. The BHW will be recruited and selected by the
barangay membership, and will be primarily responsible to the people of
the barangay through the Barangay Development Council. The BHW will be
supported by the barangay through the income of a number of community
income generating projects that will be set up under the control of the
Barangay Development Council. The BHW's work will complement that of
the Government health programs at the primary level, The BHW will be
technically supervised by the Government health personnel and his/her
work will be linked with that of other health facilities. Thus, while
the BHW would be recognized and supported by the Government, he/she
would not become a part of the health care delivery system. The BHW
would be mainly responsible to the people he/she serves. The barangay
1/ There have been many definitions of primary health care. WHO/UNICEF
consider primary health care to be the sum total of all health related
activities at the interphase between the community and the health
delivery system, provided with active community participation.

membership will decide on basic issues and policies, plan activities, and
support the implementation of health programs in their own community.
The barangay health workers will function as multi-purpose workers
engaged in health, family planning and nutrition activities. These
workers will coordinate their activities with other workers at the
barangay level, through the Barangay Development Council.
8.        The program will be implemented in two phases.  In the first
phase, to begin in 1980, the barangays of 100 municipalities whose
medical officers have been trained during 1979 shall be covered.
The second phase will cover the remaining barangays in the program.
Before the second phase of the program is undertaken, an evaluation of
the first phase of the program shall be carried out.

PHILIPPINES POPULATION PROJECT II
PROCEDURES FOR DISBURSEMENTS AGAINST
CERTIFICATES OF EXPENDITURE
1.       Construction work for the 915 Barangay Health Stations (BHS) will
be carried out by the barangay communities themselves. In exceptional
cases where communities are not able to implement the construction or,
in the case of health centers, where local competitive bidding does not
result in reasonable contracts, construction will be carried out by force account
through a Government agency (mostly the Ministers of Local Governments
and Community Development--MLGCD). Each barangay selected for building
a BHS under this project will establish a BHS Implementation Committee
with members representing the Barangay Development Council, the Municipal
Development Council (MLGCD), and the Rural Health Unit.
2.       Disbursements for civil works carried out by force account will
be made on the basis of Certified Statements of Expenditure. Such
statements should be prepared for total expenditures related to: (a) con-
struction of BHSs through community participation; and (b) construction
of health centers and BHSs through force account. These statements
should include, inter alia, the following information: (a) cumulative
expenditures up to the beginning of the reporting period; (b) expenditures
during the reporting period; (c) cumulative expenditures to the end of
the reporting period; and (d) total eligible amount to be reimbursed.
The statements should be certified by the Financial and Management
Service of the Ministry of Health and the auditor. A model form is
included as Attachment 1.
3.       The Statement of Expenditures should be supported by a summary
breakdown of expenditures specifying amounts spent for: (a) materials
(paid against invoices); (b) materials (donated by communities); (c) labor
(paid against invoices); (d) labor (community's contribution); (e) overhead
and any other related expenditures; and (f) total expenditures (see
Attachment 2). The Ministry of Health should maintain a record of ex-
penditures, according to these classifications, for each individual BHS
or Health Center.
4.       The Certificates of Expenditures should be prepared on a
monthly basis. Supporting documentation for these expenditures should
be retained by MOR's Financial and Management Services and be made available
to IDA representatives for inspection during the course of progress review
missions.
5.       In each of the 19 provinces where health centers and BHSs will
be built, the Provincial Health Officer will be the focus for financial
and reporting arrangements related to the implementation of the BHS
through community activities. Monthly records for each BHS and health
center built through force account or community participation will be
collected at the Provincial Health Officer's office. These statements will
be prepared and signed by the Sanitary Inspector of the respective Rural
Health Unit.
6.       The Sanitary Inspector will be helped by the Provincial Engineer
(MLGCD) in preparing such forms.

/1  First Population Project was financed with a Bank loan.  Estimate of Bank contribution for 1975-1978
is based on 7.5% of disbursements for the periods shown.  It is assumed that 15% of the first project,
supporting the strengthening and expansion of the health services went for family planning services:
half of this was financed by the Government and half by the IBRID loan. Estimate of Bank contribution
for CY1979 is based on the Bank's support to POPCOM and NFPO under the amendment to the first project.
/2 Based on data supplied by UNFPA
