IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT (CREDIT 2105-BU)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Transport Sector Project in
Burundi, for which Credit 2105-BU in the amount of SDR 32.7 M (US$43.2 million equivalent)
was approved on March 20, 1990, and made effective on December 3, 1990.
The credit was closed on January 31, 1999, after three extensions from the original
closing date of December 31, 1995. The final disbursement took place on January 31, 2000; a
balance of the credit in the amount of SDR 72,349 (US$101,288 equivalent) is in the process of
being canceled. On July 27 1995, the project was retrofitted, and an amount of SDR 1,590,000
(US$2,477,776.50) was canceled. In August 1997, the project was restructured, and another
cancellation in the amount of SDR 3,400,000 (US$4,634,642) was made.
Co-financing for the project was provided by the African Development Bank (AfDB),
Administration Generale de la Cooperation au Dev61oppement (AGCD, Belgian Aid Agency);
Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ, Aid Agency of the Federal
Republic of Germany); Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC, French Aid Fund); Organization
of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC); Japan and Italy.
The ICR was prepared by Juvenal Nzambimana, Operations Officer (World Bank Office,
Burundi) and Farida Khan, Operations Analyst, AFTT2, and reviewed by Aubert Zohore, Task
Team Leader, AFTT2, Maryvonne Plessis-Fraissard, Technical Manager, Emmanuel Mbi,
Country Director for Burundi and the Country Team. The preparation is based on material in the
project file and comments by other staff having been involved in implementation and members
of the Country Team. The co-financiers were not available to provide comments.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during IDA's final supervision/completion mission in
November 1998 and February 1999. The Borrower commented on the draft ICR and its views
are reflected in its own evaluation (Attached).

REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT (CREDIT 2105-BU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
Prior to the Transport Sector Project, IDA had financed one engineering and four
highway projects and helped develop the country's trucking operations. The First Highway
Project (Cr. 467-BU) was completed in 1980 and provided US$5.0 million for a road
maintenance project. The Transport Sector Project was to support the Government's
development strategy and structural adjustment program by supporting sector reforms consistent
with the program and conformed to its Public Investment and Public Expenditure Program.
Project Objectives and Components
The original project objectives were to: (i) reform transport sector policies to promote
greater competition and price liberalization; (ii) develop planning capabilities within the
Ministry of Transport (MTPDU) and Ministry of Transport, Posts and Telecommunications
(MTPT); (iii) consolidate, expand and improve maintenance practices, institutions and funding in
the road sector including support for starting up the participation of the private sector in road
maintenance activities and upgrading a selected road to paved standards; and (iv) provide support
to coffee production and marketing through rehabilitation and maintenance of access roads to the
coffee production areas. These objectives were to be achieved through implementation of a:
(a) Transport Component which included: (i) Technical Assistance, (ii) Training, (iii)
Study Fund; and (iv) Transport Investments;
(b) Road Component which included: (i) Road Rehabilitation/Upgrading/Improvement
Program; (ii) Periodic Maintenance Program; (iii) Routine Maintenance Program; (iv) Coffee
Road Program; and (v) Institutional Development.
The project was retrofitted in July 1995 and restructured in August 1997. The original
objectives of the project were not altered at the time of retrofitting. The project was restructured
in August 1997, due to country conditions and the project objectives were limited to: (i) setting
up the framework for the reform of the Direction Gen6rale des Routes (DGR) and the creation of
a second generation road fund, to improve the management and financing of road maintenance
works; and (ii) execution of road rehabilitation works, to maintain important links to coffee
stations and improve some urban road links, with a view to creating jobs, especially through
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).
i



Credit Covenants and Special Agreements. Original project objectives were reinforced
by covenants concerning project and transport sector finance, and a requirement of the sectoral
Project Expenditure Program (PEP) review mechanism.
Evaluation of Project Objectives and Covenants: Original project objectives were
clear and were fully consistent with the Government's adjustment program implemented with
IDA support. Relevant covenants were set in place to minimize the risks of local counterpart
funds for the road maintenance components by providing sectoral PEP review mechanism.
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
Achievement of Objectives. The project's original objectives were only partially
achieved. Project implementation was adversely affected by a severe socio-political crisis in
Burundi beginning in 1993, followed by a coup d'etat in 1996. These resulted in very difficult
economic circumstances. The effects of these factors are difficult to separate from inherent
project implementation weaknesses following these events. The project's revised physical and
institutional objectives were fully achieved, but the sustainability of achievements as a whole is
uncertain and will depend on whether or not the proposed new organizational framework for
DGR and the creation of a new generation road fund are carried out by the Borrower.
Economic Evaluation. The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and the Net Present Value
(NPV) were not evaluated as the project was restructured and the hypothesis used at the time of
the Staff Appraisal Report were no longer valid at completion.
Summary of Costs and Financing Arrangements: Total disbursement from the Credit
amounted to SDR 27,451,743. As per the Credit Agreement, the counterpart contribution from
the government was to be 28% of the total project cost. But due to the Government's inability to
finance the counterpart funds (in light of country conditions), the Bank agreed to changes in this
Credit and other Credit Agreements with Burundi, to finance 100% (net of taxes) on all
categories.
Implementation Schedule: The credit effectiveness was over 4 months behind schedule
and the closing date was postponed by over 3 years. The socio-political crisis is a major reason
for these delays. However, there were also some institutional/structural problems: limited sector
management capacity; cumbersome procurement process; and an inexperienced private sector.
Analysis of Key Factors Affecting Original Major Objectives: The socio-political
crisis was the major factor negatively impacting on the achievement of objectives. Other factors
affecting the project, were: withdrawal of co-financiers; lack of counterpart funds; delays in
procurement.
Assessment of the Borrower's and Bank's Performance: Overall, the Bank's
performance in preparing and supervising the project was satisfactory. The Borrower's
performance was mixed (less than satisfactory and partially satisfactory in various issues)
between effectiveness and 1996, then improved to satisfactory thereafter.
ii



Assessment of Project's Outcome: The outcome of the project is judged as partially
satisfactory. This assessment is based on the restructured project objectives. However, the
sustainability is deemed uncertain in the absence of the implementation of reforms in the
management andfunding mechanism of the road sector.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned. The environment
under which the project was designed changed drastically due to various factors that impeded the
project, the most significant being the civil strife that broke out in 1993 and thereon, hampered
the implementation of the project. A follow-up project is planned for FY2001. The key lessons
learned are to: (i) keep the objectives few and simple; and (ii) be less ambitious in planning
different reforms in a country in which political risks are high and that has had no past
experience with the private management and implementation of civil works.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT (CREDIT 2105-BU)
PART 1. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.   STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.    The project was to support at the sector level, the macroeconomic policies of the
Governnent and its efforts of structural adjustment. The objectives of the project were to: (i)
reform transport sector policies; (ii) develop planning capabilities within MTPDU and MTPT;
(iii) consolidate and improve maintenance practices and institutions, including support for
starting up the participation of the private sector in road maintenance activities; (iv) upgrade a
selected road to paved standards; and (v) provide support to coffee production and marketing
through rehabilitation and maintenance of access roads to the coffee production areas. The
project was to achieve these objectives through two major components: (i) institutional support
to the General Directorate for Transport (DGT); and (ii) four year road rehabilitation and
maintenance program which included: (a) periodic maintenance of paved roads; (b) limited
upgrading; (c) rehabilitation of coffee roads; (d) sub-sector related studies; (e) institutional
strengthening.
2.    The project was retrofitted in June 1995 and then restructured in August 1997. The
retrofitting in 1995 was done to reduce the scope of the project while keeping the same
objectives. The overall progress of the project was hampered by the lack of counterpart funds,
the cumbersome local procurement procedures for SMEs contracting, the weak management
capacity of the national executing agency, the non disengagement of the State from works
execution by force account, the lack of progress in the transport sector reforms and the socio
political crisis that had been persistent since 1993. To improve the progress, the Credit
Agreement was amended in June 1995, to reflect the following changes:
(i) extension of the project completion date by two years to June 30, 1997;
(ii) increase in IDA financing to 100% for all disbursement categories, to compensate for
counterpart funds;
(iii) cancellation of category 2(a) which was to finance investment activities in the transport
sector other than roads, but had been dormant with no chance of being used;
(iv) major restructuring of the "Direction Generale des Routes" (the Roads Directorate, DGR).
This restructuring was to reduce by at least 60% DGR works execution by the force account by
end 1996, and 100% within a four year period. The new role of the DGR, after the restructuring,
was to focus on planning and supervision of road maintenance, increase contracting out and
cleaning up arrears in order to restore confidence and generate income in the private sector;



support the private sector through transfer of depreciated construction equipment to local
contractors and setting up leasing procedures for non-depreciated equipment;
(v) streamlining procurement procedures and setting up within the Ministry of Public Works, a
Special Procurement Commission, using simplified procedures for SMEs contracting and
payment, based on transparent and efficient procedures;
(vi) establishing a sustainable road maintenance mechanism (a new road fund based on road
users contribution and their participation in its management);
(vii) extensive promotion program of SMEs in road maintenance activities, and particularly their
training in labor intensive techniques for job creation; and
(viii) implementing the transport sector reforms as recommended by the different studies
financed by the project, and concerning particularly the following public enterprises: STB (the
Government pool of vehicles), OTRACO (urban and long-distance transport), Air Burundi and
EPB (ports).
3.    The political conditions in the country did not improve and the action plan that was to be
implemented did not go as planned. The political instability, coupled with an economic blockade
imposed by Burundi's neighbors in the wake of the coup d'etat in July 1996, made it necessary
to reduce the project scope and thus the project was restructured in August 1997. The
restructured project objectives were limited to two:
(i)   setting up the framework, to be executed when conditions would permit, for the
reforn of the Direction Generale des Routes (DGR) and the creation of a second
generation road fund to improve the management and financing of roads
maintenance works; and
(ii)  execution of roads rehabilitation works, to maintain important links to coffee
stations and improve some urban road links, with a view to creating jobs,
especially through Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).
4.    The activities underlying the above restructured project objectives have been executed
satisfactorily. The framework for the restructuring of the Direction Generale des Routes was
completed with recommendations for an implementation plan. A draft law for a new road fund
mechanism is also completed. The civil works planned under the project have also been
completed.
B.   ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS
5.    The project objectives, as set out in the Staff Appraisal Report, were reduced to two as
above, due to socio-political crisis with the attendant severe economic problems. The entire
Burundi portfolio was suspended for almost one year from July 1996 to June 1997.
2



6.    Economic Evaluation. The overall Economic Rate of Return (ERR) at the time of
appraisal was calculated at 32 percent. The ERR and the Net Present Value (NPV) were not
evaluated as the project was restructured and the hypothesis used at the time of the Staff
Appraisal Report were not valid at completion.
7.    Restructured Project Objectives. The first objective of "setting up the framework for
reform of Direction Generale des Routes and the creation of a second generation roadfund to
improve the management and financing of roads maintenance works" was achieved. The
restructuring plan was defined with an implementation agreed to by DGR and its tutelle Ministry
and the Ministry of Finance. The implementation is awaiting full endorsement by the council of
Ministers. The second objective of "execution of roads rehabilitation works, to maintain
important links to coffee stations and improve some urban road links, with a view to creating
jobs, especially through SMEs was also achieved as all the works planned were well executed.
C.   MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
8.    Factors not generally subject to government control: Project implementation was
affected by various factors that impeded on its expected output. Two years before its original
closing date (June 1995), a civil war broke out and the momentum for the implementation was
reduced. A retrofitting of the project was done in 1995 to reduce the scope of the project while
keeping the same objectives. In the first year of the project extension, all the Bank financed
projects in Burundi were suspended including this project. The action plan that was to be
implemented did not go as planned. The political instability in the country coupled with the
economic blockade that the country went through for two years did affect negatively the cost of
the project, limited the expected results of the projects, the Borrower's ability to conduct
international trade and the Bank's ability to supervise the project. Other donors in the sector
suspended their activities as well, and most of them have not yet resumed assistance in the sector.
A sector that has depended for many years on external assistance was left on its own with little
planning capabilities, lack of maintenance budget and the risk of losing the investment of the
past years.
9.    Factors generally subject to government control: The major factor affecting the
project and subject to the Government' control was the lack of implementation capacity. The
start-up was slow due mainly to vacancies at DGT and it's inability to retain skilled staff who
preferred opportunities offered by the private sector. Recommendations of various studies done
by external consultants for the benefit of the DGT were never implemented. There were
institutional weaknesses in DGR. To rectify this situation, IDA provided technical assistance.
However, at the end of the TA assignments there was little transfer of capacity as the planning
capabilities in the two ministries remain low.
D.   PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
10.   The project sustainability depends on a great deal on the borrower's commitment to
successfully conduct the ongoing reforms on the restructuring of the Direction Generale des
Routes and the creation of a new fimding mechanism for roads maintenance. While the
environment remains risky, it is imperative for the borrower to take the necessary measures to
3



create a better framework for the sustainable maintenance of its investments in the road sector.
With the proposed involvement of the private sector and the civil society in the management of
the road fund, better planning is expected with an execution based on agreed priorities. The
closed project as well as future operations are likely to be sustainable if the Borrower is
committed to carrying out the proposed reforms, promoting private sector involvement in the
execution of civil works, and to better planning of road maintenance, based on the priorities. The
project was able to create interest and capacity of the private sector in executing civil works. The
growth of this sector will depend on the Government's commitment to program and fund the
rehabilitation and maintenance program in the road sector.
E.  BANK PERFORMANCE
11.   The Bank's performance is considered satisfactory in project identification, preparation
assistance, appraisal and supervision. The Bank reacted proactively and realistically to the
changing country and implementation conditions by suspending the project, then limited its
objectives to what could be realistically accomplished. In doing so, the Bank furthered the sector
dialogue and built up the consensus now shared by the Borrower for the implementation of the
reforms.
12.   The Bank acted as the executing agency for the US$4.2 million OPEC funds for the
construction of a 27-km new road linking Bujumbura to the province of Bubanza. The works
were implemented according to the same arrangements as the IDA funded works.
F.  BORROWER PERFORMANCE
13.   Borrower performance evolved from less than satisfactory up to 1996, to satisfactory
thereafter. During the initial period of implementation, the project had four different project
managers and eight different ministers. This rotation affected the project implementation. The
inefficiency of the DGR to carry out its mandate to plan, control and execute civil works, and the
lack of budgetary allocations for road maintenance were the basis for the proposed reforms. The
Borrower initially did not provide the leadership needed to define and carry out the reforms
needed. DGR was entrusted to reform itself and no progress was made. Further, with the
changing conditions, the Borrower did not provide enough counterpart funds to implement the
project and an amendment to the project was done to increase IDA financing to 100 percent, after
1995. In addition, the technical assistance that was provided at the beginning of the project to
strengthen the planning capabilities of the two ministries did not yield any results, due to the lack
of couterparts.
14.   Beginning in 1997, the Borrower reversed its course and provided high level involvement
to reestablish an affordable level of financing of road maintenance to complement activities
under the project; US$286,600 equivalent was provided in 1997 and US$1,508,900 in 1998.
Further, the Borrower agreed to and provided guidance in carrying out studies to define the
framework for the reorganization of the DGR to limit its mandate to planning and supervision of
capital investments in road works to be carried out by the private sector; and the preparation of
new legislation to create a new generation road fund. The results of these studies are awaiting
Cabinet discussions for implementation
4



G.   ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
15.   Most of the revised physical objectives of the project were achieved. Despite the
shortcomings, the Borrower performed better on physical objectives than on institutional ones.
Most of the programmed civil works were done and of good quality. There were the construction
of a new road and the rehabilitation of 3 main roads leading to the interior of the country; civil
works contract to SMEs increased from 4 in 1993 to 48 at closing of the project. The project's
development objectives were partially achieved and the outcome is judged as partially
satisfactory. This assessment is based on the restructured project.
H.   FUTURE OPERATIONS
16.   A follow-up project is in the pipeline for FY2000. The proposed project would aim to
rehabilitate major road infrastructure to improve access to markets internally and imports/exports
of goods, providing employment in support of restarting the economy and policy improvement
for management and financing of road infrastructure. The appraisal is scheduled for September
2000 and Board presentation for December 2000.
1.    LESSONS LEARNED
17.   The original project design was appropriate and included relevant physical, institutional
and macro-economic impacts for the country. In addition, the project introduced the concept of
private Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the rehabilitation of roads. These SMEs did
not exist at the beginning of the project but by the end of the project more than 100 existed.
While employment generation was not an major initial objective, its impact on employment
through the creation of SMEs was very substantial. Each SME contract employed on average
150 persons per day. The duration of each contract was on average 3 months and there were
about 48 contracts. Institutional reform targets were initially too ambitious and had to be scaled
down. At appraisal, it was expected that by completion date the reforms in transport and road
sectors would be completed. The Bank and the Borrower realized that this objective was not
achievable and rather restructured the project to be more realistic, limiting the outcome to the
definition and agreement on the required framework for the reforms. Another lesson that was
learnt is that the institution to be reformed was entrusted to reorganize itself. The Direction
Generale des Routes which was the key implementing agency was entrusted with the mission to
conduct the reforms of itself and this slowed down the project. In the future, it would be
preferable for an independent body to carry out the proposed reforms. The experience with the
creation of SMEs has generated much enthusiasm from small entrepreneurs who have proven to
be very capable of executing quality civil works. One of the main key issues is the sustainability
of the reforms in the road sector, in particular, the implementation of a good road maintenance
funding mechanism.

PRtOJIET SECTORIEL TRNSPORTS 
I. PREVISIONS
I.1.Objectifs
Le projet avait pour objectifs de:
a) reduire les cofts globaux de transport pour le pays;
b) assurer une meilleure integration economique du pays et du secteur, en encourageant en
particulier le secteur prive national, transporteurs aussi bien qu'entreprises de construction, et
en liberalisant le secteur des transports;
c) contribuer positivement au financement des depenses de l'Etat et A l'equilibre budgetaire;
d) consolider et ameliorer les methodes, les institutions et le financement de l'entretien routier,
et parvenir A un meilleur equilibre entre entretien et constructions neuves ; et
e) developper les capacites de planification pour le secteur des transports, tant au Ministere des
Travaux Publics que dans le Ministere des Transports.
1.2. Composantes du projet.
L.2.1.Composante Transport
Cette composante devait fournir a la DGT ['aide institutionnelle n6cessaires a l'execution
d'etudes de transports et comprendrait une provision pour des besoins en investissements de
transport qui sera identifie au cours de ces etudes. En outre, une direction des transports routiers
etait a etablir au sein du MTPT pour suivre le contrat de performance de l'OTRACO ainsi que le
trafic de passagers et de fret. Les objectifs globaux de ce support institutionnel a la DGT etaient
(i) de creer une base de donnees de transport et de renforcer la capacite de planification de la
DGT; (ii) d'aider a suivre le transport international et A preparer des politiques sectorielles
ad6quates, ayant specialement pour but de diversifier les routes d' exportation du caf6 et
d'abaisser les cofits globaux de transport; (iii) aider le pays dans son dialogue avec les pays de
transit, par une meilleure connaissance des donnees du probleme, et outre les initiatives prises
par d'autres aides exterieures, qui ont essentiellement pour but d'amnliorer l'infrastructure de
transit; et iv) aider A reformer les entreprises publiques de transport.
L'appui voulu consistait en (i) une assistance technique (48 hommes-mois d'economiste de
transport, 24 hommes-mois des services d'un expert pour, mission de courte duree et 48
21



hommes-mois des services d'un expert en gestion des entreprises publiques de transport, 12
hommes-mois d'experts pour mission de courte duree et 48 hommes-mois des services d'un
economiste des transport a recruter localement), qui prenaient la releve de 1'assistance technique
financee dans le cadre du Quatrieme Projet Routier depuis Novembre 1988; et (ii) de la
formation pour les personnels de la DGT y compris l'organisation de seminaires a Bujumbura et
des stages a l'etranger (60 hommes-mois) qui seront finances dans le cadre du projet.
Le projet finan,ait un certain nombre d'etudes de transports, y compris des etudes sur:
(i)   la securite routiere, la r6glementation routiere et les conditions du trafic urbain a
Bujumbura;
(ii)  les conditions de la navigation et sa securite sur le lac ainsi que le developpement de
petites installations portuaires destinees aux pecheurs, le long de ses rives.
(iii) le transport aerien y compris l'administration de l'aeroport international de Bujumbura
et la gestion d'Air Burundi.
Ces etudes etaient de l'ordre de 24 hommes-mois d'experts. Une provision correspondant au
fmancement d'etudes supplementaires, sur lesquelles un accord devait se faire ulterieurement
(14 hommes-mois) ainsi qu'une provision pour financer des investissements prioritaires a
identifier au cours de ces etudes tels que le renouvellement d'equipement aerien et les
dispositifs pour amneliorer la securite de la navigation lacustre.
1.2.2. Composante routiere.
A. Description
(i)    un programme de remise en etat, de construction et bitumage d'une route en terre et
d'entretien des routes, consistant en:
(a) la remise en etat (75 km), et le resurfa9age (en couche simple ou double) de 413 km de routes
bitumees, I'amenagement en route revetue d'une route en laterite de 26, 4 km ainsi que la
remise en etat de 565km de routes en terre ou en laterite;
(b) les points a temps sur tout le reseau revetu (1011 km); le rechargement au choix d'environ
1200km de routes en terre (en quatre ans), le reprofilage de la plupart des routes en terre et en
laterite, l'entretien a base de main d'oeuvre de la totalite du reseau principal de l'ordre de
4100 km et la remise en etat et l'entretien de ponts;
(ii)   la remise en etat et 1'entretien des pistes de desserte des usines de lavage de cafe par de
petites et moyennes entreprises locales utilisant essentiellement des techniques a haute
intensite de main-d'aeuvre (HIMO);
22



(iii)  un appui institutionnel A la DGR par l'intermediaire de la creation d'une Cellule de
Gestion Routiere de l'assistance technique et de la formation pour son personnel, et pour
les petites et moyennes entreprises de travaux publics; etc...
(iv)  l'etude de faisabilite d'un groupement de location d'outillages routiers;
(i)   en une insistance sur le drainage et sur les points noirs;
(ii)   en la mise en place d'un systeme d'entretien d'entretien routier A base de main d'ceuvre;
et
(iii)  par la suite, en une amelioration systematique de la viabilite des routes par construction
des bermes localisees et rechargement local.
Ces travaux devaient etre executes A l'entreprise, principalement par des PME locales utilisant
avant tout de la main d'oeuvre, sous le contr8le de la DGR. De la formation devrait etre
dispensee pour ces PME
(c) Renforcement des institutions
Le programme routier pluriannuel comprend une composante importante, incluant l'assistance
technique et la formation pour appuyer le developpement institutionnel dans le sous-secteur.
Deux nouveaux services, une Cellule de Gestion Routiere (CGR) et une Cellule de Contr6le des
Travaux devaient etre mises en place A la DGR comme services permanents. Des programmes
d'assistance technique et de formation ont ete concus globalement pour coordonner les
interventions des differentes aides exterieures. Le programme d'assistance technique a ete concu
de facon A aider A developper, au sein de la DGR, des competences en matiere de planification,
d'appel A la sous-traitance et de contr6le de qualite; de renforcer ses capacites de gestion dans
des domaines oui il est difficile de recruter et de conserver des personnels nationaux competents.
Le programme de formation etait fondamentalement la suite des actions entreprises dans le cadre
du Quatrieme Projet Routier et il visait egalement A satisfaire les besoins nouveaux resultant de
l'intervention du secteur prive dans le cadre du Quatrieme Projet Routier et il visait egalement A
satisfaire les besoins nouveaux resultant de l'intervention du secteur prive dans les activites
d'entretien routier. On prevoyait que l'IDA financerait 340 hommes-mois d'experts
intemationaux et 144 hommes-mois de jeunes experts recrutes localement dans le cadre du
projet, tandis que le FAC, 1'AGCD et la GTZ financeront respectivement 44 hommes-mois, 44
hommes-mois et 220 hommes-mois.
2.   ASSISTANCE TECHNIQUE
I1 etait prevu que le FAC fournisse une assistance financiere et detache deux expatries pour aider
a creer la Cellule de Gestion Routiere et pour mettre en place et faire fonctionner un systeme de
23



gestion des routes . La premiere phase etait consacree au r6seau bitume, et la seconde sur le
reseau non rev&u; La Cellule avait pour mission d'installer le modele HDM-III.
Cette Cellule rattachee directement au Directeur General 6tait responsable du regroupement des
donnees et de la constitution d'une base de donnees sur les routes, comprenant leurs
caracteristiques geometriques et physiques, des donnees sur leur construction et leur entretien, les
couits unitaires des activites routieres et de l'exploitation des vehicules, et enfin des donnees sur
le trafic.
Une Cellule de controle etait a creer au sein de la DTEC pour gerer les marches d'entretien des
routes confies aux entreprises privees de travaux publics, et pour contr6ler 1'execution de tous les
travaux d'entretien routier, A l'entreprise ou en regie. La DTEC etait d6ja responsable du contr6le
des travaux neufs et des grandes operations de remise en etat executes A 1'entreprise. La nouvelle
cellule avait besoin de l'aide d'un ing6nieur expatrie finance par 1'IDA, appuyant pour la
formation des ingenieurs locaux, homologues travaillant deja au sein de la DTEC.
Outre ce qui precede, la DGR avait encore besoin d'assistance technique pour renforcer ses
capacites administratives. Bien que le nombre d'expatries diminuait sur les chantiers, 1'assistance
technique etait encore necessaire pour aider la DGR a assurer ses fonctions traditionnelles dans
les domaines ci-apres : (i) comptabilite et gestion financiere; (ii) approvisionnement de pieces de
rechange et de materiaux ; (iii) gestion des travaux en regie et contr6le des couits (iv)
fonctionnement des ateliers et des magasins A Bujumbura et des magasins regionaux A Bururi,
Gitega et Ngozi (quatre experts fournis par la RFA); et (v) fonctionnement de la brigade
d'entretien et de reconstruction des ponts (un expert fourni par la RFA).
Outre les experts semi permanents, la DGR avait recours A des expatries engages pour de courtes
missions et A des experts locaux, sur des contrats A dur6e determinee, pour l'aider dans des
domaines specifiques, afin de compenser en particulier les difficultes auxquelles se heurte le
service pour recruter ou conserver des personnels competents, dans certaines specialites (tout
specialement la comptabilite, l'informatique, la conception de projets et le contr6le direct des
chantiers).
3. FORMATION
Le programme de formation prepare visait A satisfaire les besoins a tous les niveaux
professionnels des agents, en ce qui concerne les activites traditionnelles de la DGR et les
besoins resultant de la promotion du secteur priv6 dans le domaine de l'entretien routier. Deux
experts ont 6te recrutes a plein temps (l'un d'entre eux aida la DGR A elaborer un systeme de
gestion du personnel), et un expert en formation pendant un an et demi pour l'assistance au
secteur prive. La formation etait basee sur les estimations suivantes: (i) 260 ouvriers specialises;
24



(ii) 40 chefs de chantier et conducteurs de travaux; (iii) 120 mecaniciens adjoints et motoristes;
(iv) 36 operateurs d'6quipements ; (v) 15 comptables, secr6taires et magasiniers; et (vi) 27 cadres
de haut niveau, techniques, administratifs et financiers. Le plan de formation incluait egalement
une formation a l'etranger (60 hommes-mois). Les installations du Centre de Formation de
Gitega ont e  mises a profit pour la formation des categories (i) et (ii) .
Pour satisfaire les besoins du secteur prive participant aux travaux routiers, le projet devait aider
egalement les entreprises locales a accroitre leurs competences techniques. I1 fallait tout d'abord
organiser des seminaires au profit des cadres, des ingenieurs et des techniciens, sur les techniques
des travaux routiers, la gestion des equipements, celle des chantiers et celle des contrats. Les
operateurs et les mecaniciens renouvellant leurs connaissances a l'occasion de passages dans le
centre de formation de la DGR a Gitega. Deuxiemement, la formation en chantiers- ecoles etait
organisee au profit des entreprises de construction; un assistant technique les aidant, pendant la
formation, a executer correctement ces travaux, qu'il s'agisse de leur qualite ou de leur prix de
revient. Apres la fin de la formation, des certificats de qualification devraient etre remis aux PME
pour leur permettre de repondre aux appel d'offres..
(d) Etude de faisabilite d'un groupement de louages de materiels
Une etude analysant le bien-fonde de la mise en place d'une organisation de louage de materiels,
chargee de louer des equipements aux brigades de la DGR et aux entreprises locales devait etre
r-alisee.
25



II. REALISATIONS PHYSIQUES
Categorie 1.A. Pistes de desserte des usines i cafe.
Pendant l'execution du projet Sectoriel Transport, des marches de pistes de desserte des usines
usines A cafe ont ete ouverts , les etudes ayant ete realisees initialement par un consultant (M+R
International) .
Parmi ces marches 32 , ont et acheves et receptionnes, 10 n'ont pas ete termines et ces marches
ont ete resilies.
Durant F'annre 1996 , les marches qui etaient en cours ont ete suspendus A cause de la suspension
des decaissements sur cr6dit IDA.
Tous ces marches ont ete executes en privilegiant la methode dite A Haute Intensite de Main
D'ceuvre, en abrege "HIMO".
Ce fat l'occasion de lancer la promotion des PME burundaises d'entretien routier , la plupart
ayant travaille A la satisfaction de l'Administration.
La population burundaise habitant dans la zone du projet a pu egalement tirer profit de la

A ce financement du credit IDA s'ajoutaient entr'autres les fonds accordes par d'autres bailleurs
notamment:
OPEP.       Montant alloue :4.200.000 $US ; montant decaisse 3.419.751 $US
Fonds belgo-burundais de reemploi : Montant alloue : 300.000.000 Fbu;
montant decaisse 148.000.0000 FBU
Durant les premi&es annees , le projet a connu un faible taux de decaissement dui essentiellement
aux causes suivantes
- la lourdeur des procedures de passation des marches qui n'a pas permis la signature des contrats
dans les delais;
- le retard dans la mise en place de l'assistance technique;
- des difficult6s d'arreter un programme de formation acceptable par le bailleur
31



- la crise que le Burundi a connu depuis octobre 1993 et 1'embargo decide en 96 par les pays
voisins ont fait que les activites qui etaient en cours soient ralenties ou meme suspendues et,
- la suspension des decaissemets decidee par le bailleur en octobre 1996 qui a maintenu le
projet en inactivite une annee durant.
IV. CONCLUSIONS ET RECOMMANDATIONS
Le projet Sectoriel Transport signe le 20 avril 1990 mis en vigueur en decembre de la meme
annee devait etre cl6tur6 au 31 decembre 1995 . Les conditions dans lesquelles le projet a et
execute n'ont pas permis a l'emprunteur de respecter ces delais et la date de cloture est
intervenue le 31 janvier 1999.
Le projet a pu alors etre cl6tur6 malgre des difficultes rencontrees dans le cadre de son execution
avec un taux de realisation estime a 98,37%.
Les premiers problemes etant lies la mise en place effective du projet:
- mise en place tardive de I'assistance technique
- retard dans le lancement des premiers travaux
A ces problemes est venue s'ajouter la crise que le pays a connu depuis le mois d'octobre 1993.
Quant aux reformes institutionnelles , les cellules de gestion routiere et de controle des travaux
ont e  creees: La cellule de gestion routiere a fonctionne jusqu'en 1993 et la crise n'a pas
permis a cette cellule de continuer I'alimentation de la banque de donnees routieres mise en place
avec I'appui de la cooperation francaise . La cellule de contr6le des travaux evoluera en une
Direction de la Promotion des PME puis en une Direction de l'Entretien Routier .
Les autres reformes envisagees dans le cadre du PST portent sur la restructuration de la DGR
avec la creation d'une Agence des Travaux Routiers (ATR) et une Societe de Location du
Materiel (SLM) , la mise en place d'un Fonds routier efficace et capable de financer l'entretien
du reseau routier et la mise en place d'un systeme comptable adapte aux activites de la DGR lui
permettant de separer les comptes des differents bailleurs sied de base pour la restructuration .
La mise en execution des conclusions de ces 6tudes ne pourrait se faire que dans le cadre d'un
nouveau projet routier qui devra etre negocie par le gouvemement aupres des bailleurs de fonds .
La Banque Mondiale est sollicitee pour qu'elle soutienne ces reformes dans le cadre d'un PPF en
vue de preparer un nouveau projet sectoriel .
En ce qui concerne la supervision du projet , l'administration estime que des missions de
supervision ont ete bien reparties sur le delai d'execution du projet, raisons pour lesquelles des
amenagements ont ete operes a temps pour la bonne marche du projet.
