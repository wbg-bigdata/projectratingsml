MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJGCT
1.        The  following  memorandum  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed
development credit to the Republic of Burundi for SDR 32.7 million (US$ 43.2
million) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms and 40 years maturity and would help finance transport development
in Burundi.   The project would be cofinanced with AfDB (US$ 6.8 million
equivalent), AGCD (US$ 5.0 million equivalent), GTZ (1.8 million equivalent),
FAC (US$ 1.4 million equivalent), and OPEC, Japan and Italy (US$ 7.0 million
equivalent).
Background
2.        Transport within Burundi is totally dependent on the road network.
The country has no navigable river, traffic is too small to support a
railway, and internal air transport is and will remain very limited owing to
the small size of the country. The size of the network is fairly adequate.
Main roads are passable all year long and have been reasonably well
maintained in recent years. However, secondary roads have received little
maintenance and are generally not in good condition. Moreover, the main
network has been considerably extended over the last decade and the oldest
part of it is  deteriorating, which  requires  substantial  increases  in
maintenance and rehabilitation funding.   In this context, planning road
operations has become an increasingly critical function of the highway
authority - the General Directorate for Roads (DGR) of MTPDU. Lastly, rural
roads which play a vital role in coffee production and marketing have been
insufficiently maintained in the past, which is now jeopardizing the efforts
to increase production of the highest grade of coffee (fully-washed)
processed through the coffee-washing stations. Hence, there is an obvious
need to set up an organization and funding mechanisms for their maintenance
under an agreement between the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAE)
and MTPDU.
3.        As a landlocked country far from Indian Ocean ports, Burundi is
highly dependent on external transport links for its economic development.
The operational and policy constraints on the international routes facing the
landlocked countries of the region have been recently identified under the
Great Lakes Corridor Study.  Fcr Burundi, it is essential to improve the
reliability and efficiency of international transport, in particular through
lower transport costs for imports and exports (mostly coffee). To address
sectoral issues and keep up appropriate sectoral policies, the Government has
decided to amend the sectoral policy framework and develop planning and
monitoring capacities within the General Directorate for Transport (DGT) of
MTPT. These objectives have been presented by the Government in a sectoral
policy statement.   The major principles  guiding the statement  include
adopting a sectoral framework to facilitate priv We initiative in transport
and road works, increasing cost recovery, giving . :iority to maintenance over



- 2 -
new investments, and consulting with neighboring countries to improve
transportation in the Great Lakes region.
4.        Specifically, to sustain at the sectoral level the macroeconomic
objectives set for the structural adjustment program, the Government aims at
(i) improving efficiency of the transport parastatals (OTRABU and OTRACO);
(ii) improving cost recovery mechanisms for transport infrastructure in order
to substantially increase maintenance funding without increasing the budget
deficit; (iii) increasing competition between public and private operators;
and (iv) developing the role of the domestic private sector in road
maintenance operations.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
5.        The Transport Sector Project is an integral part of the structural
adjustment and economic an! social development process led by the Government
with the support of IDA ard other donors.   The transport sector has an
essential role to play in sustaining the Government's macroeconomic policy
as exposed in the latest Policy Framework Paper dated June 14, 1989. The
proposed project will contribute to deepen economic liberalization in the
sector, lower overall internal and external transport costs, improve
mobilization of local resources, reduce the budget deficit and improve the
efficiency of transport parastatals, increase export revenues and reinforce
the sector's planning capacity especially in preparing appropriate sectoral
PIPs and PEPs.
Proiect Objectives
6.        The project's objectives are to:  (i) reform transport sector
policies to promote greater competition and price liberalization; (ii)
develop planning and monitoring capabilities within MTPDU and MTPT; (iII)
consolidate, expand and improve maintenance practices, institutions and
funding in the road sector including support for starting up the
participation of the private sector in road maintenance activities; (iv)
upgrade a selected road to paved standards; and (v) provide support to coffee
production and marketing through rehabilitation and maintenance of access
roads to coffee production areas.
Proiect Description
7.        The project will cover roads and transport, the responsibility of
which is split between two ministries: MTPDU and MTPT. It covers a four-
year program (1990-1993) to meet the country's priorities and received donor
suppo:t during a Round Table held in Bujumbura in April 1989.  In addition
to policy measures aimed at liberalization and improved resource mobilization
and allocation in the sector, the project would have two major components:
(i) institutional support to DGT including (a) technical assistance
to assist in creating a transport data base, monitoring
international transport, preparing adequate sector policies and
reforming transport parastatals; (b) training; and (c) subsector-
related studies and a provision to finance priority transport
investments to be identified during the abovementioned studies.



- 3 -
(ii) a four-year road upgrading, rehabilitation and maintenance program
including (a) periodic and routine maintenance of paved roads; (b)
upgrading, rehabilitation and maintenance of unpaved roads of the
main network, an increasing portion of which will be contracted
out; (c) rehabilitation and maintenance of coffee roads; (d)
subsector-related studies; and (e) institutional strengthening
through the creation within DGR of two permanent Units for road
planning and control of maintenance works, with technical
assistance and training (including for the adoption of appraisal
and execution methods taking environmental concerns into account).
The proposed Transport Sector Project supports the Government's macroeconomic
development strategy and structural adjustment program and conforms to its
PIP and PEP defined in coordination with IDA. It is also consistent with and
supportive to IDA's following operations: the Small Scale Enterpriseb!APEX
Project (Cr. 1889-BU), the Agricultural Services Sector Project (Cr. 2024-
BU) and the Coffee Sector Project under pre'aration.
Prolect Costs
8.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$ 90.8 million
equivalent with foreign costs of about US$ 57.5 million and local costs of
US$ 33.3 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of B,nk Group operations in Burundi ore
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No.7848-BU dated February 28, 1990, is being distributed separately.
Actions Azreed
9.        The Government has presented to IDA a statement of sectoral policy
and agreed to: (i) give priority to maintenance over new construction in
allocating funds to the transport sector and especially to the road
subsector; 'ii) set up appropriate cost recovery mechanisms including fuel
pricing to provide funding for maintenance of the main road ne;work, and for
rehabilitation and maintenance of the coffee roads; (iii) set up appropriate
institutional arrangements for operations on the coffee roads; (iv)
increasingly involve the private sector in road maintenance operations; and
(v) amend the sectoral policy framework in order to liberalize transport
operations and increase competition between private and public operators
(including foreign exchange allocations, port operations, privatisation of
the freight transport parastatal (OTRABU) and reforming the passenger
transport parastatal (OTRACO) under a performance contract). Conditions of
effectiveness will bet
(a)  implementation of appropriate road users taxation and fuel pricing
policy agreed upon at negotiations;
(b)  appropriate budget allocation for road activities for DGR in 1990;
(c)  decision on operating the port of Bujumbura according to private
management principles agreed at negotiations; and



(d)  liberalization  of  the  prices  of  transport  by  road  and
implementation of an appropriate performance contract between the
Government and the passenger transport parastatal.
An agreewent satisfactory to IDA betwee. MAE arnd MTPDU for management of
coffee roads and the setting up of an adequate mechanism to finance their
maintenance and rehabilitation would be a condition of disbursement for
coffee roads.
Benefits
10.       Improvement in road maintenan-e would facilitate transport of goods
and persons countrywide, reduce vehicle operating costs and the need for
costly rehabilitation in the future.   Improvement of coffee roads would
support coffee production and marketing, and contribute to the increase in
foreign exchange earnings and farmers' revenues. Improving the institutional
framework would ensure better planning and management practices in the
sector. Improving external transport conditions through better road access
and trensport policies would lower overall transport costs for both imports
and exports. The promotion of small- and medium-scale domestic contractors
who will mostly carry out labor-based road maintenance operations would
provide employment to the rural poor.
Risks
11.       The main risks associated with the project arise from the limited
capabilities of the private sector for executing road maintenance works and
possible shortage of local counterpart funds for the road maintenance
components. These risks will be minimized by (i) the project providing for
support to and gradual involvemert of the private sector and (ii) the
sectoral PEP review mechanism which will help adjust yearly work programs to
available financing.
Recommendation
12.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
