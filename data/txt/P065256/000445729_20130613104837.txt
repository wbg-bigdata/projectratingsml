                               RESTRUCTING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.     This is a proposal for a Level 2 restructuring of the Peru National Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Project. The Project is financed by two loans, Loan No. 7142,
approved in 2002 for US$50 million, and Loan No. 7978, an additional financing loan of
US$30 million approved in 2010. Due to recent Government policy changes, the Project
design is no longer aligned with the Government's policies in the rural water sector and
the Government has requested the following changes:

        i) Advance the dates of closing of both Loans from December 31, 2013 to June
30, 2013 to allow all rural water and sanitation interventions in Peru to be aligned with
the strategy of National Rural Sanitation Program
        ii) Reallocate category loan allocations for Loan No. 7142 to account for actual
expenditures
        iii) Modify the financing percentages for Loan No. 7978 to fully utilize the loan
funds before project’s new closing dates.

2.     The Government is committed to financing after project’s new closing date, all
the remaining works and activities until finalization, with own resources.

B. PROJECT STATUS

3.     The development objective of the National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Project (PRONASAR) is to increase the sustainable use of new and rehabilitated water
supply and sanitation facilities in rural areas and small towns while emphasizing
improvement in hygiene practices and training in operation and maintenance.

4.      On September 13, 2002, Loan No. 7142–PE was signed for US$50 million and on
December 14, 2010 Loan No. 7978-PE was signed for an additional US$30 million. Loan
No. 7142-PE was first restructured in 2006 mainly to address issues related to
advancement in the consolidation of sector institutions and the inability of FONCODES –
originally the main implementing agency of Component 1 – to change its methodology
and implement the Project’s designed demand-driven and participative approach to
building rural WSS systems. In November 2008, a second restructuring for Loan No.
7142-PE was approved to extend the original Project’s closing date to December 31,
2010. A third restructuring for Loan No. 7142-PE was approved in order to support the
implementation of the additional financing and extend the Project’s closing date to
December 31, 2013. Loan No. 7978-PE has never been amended. The project’s overall
progress towards achievement of the PDO and overall implementation progress are
currently rated as Moderately Satisfactory (MS).


                                           6
5.       To date, Loan No. 7142-PE has been fully disbursed, while disbursements for
Loan No. 7978-PE stands at US$14,446,902 which corresponds to 48.16% of the US$30
million financing. The execution of Components 2 (water supply and sanitation for small
cities) and 3 (capacity building) was finalized on December 31, 2010. The project is
currently extending all efforts in order to accelerate the implementation of Component 1
(water supply and sanitation for small rural communities).

6.      An action plan for the implementation of these changes has been agreed upon
with the Borrower. With this plan, the project implementation would be accelerated in
order to maximize the achievement of the Project Development Objectives. However, it
is estimated that about 80% of the agreed PAD targets would probably be achieved under
Component 1 by end of June 2013.

7.     In 2011 the Government of Peru created the National Rural Sanitation Program
(PNSR), a technical-administrative unit that specializes in the implementation of water
and sanitation projects in rural areas. The creation of PNSR enabled a consolidation of all
rural water-related activities and investments under one authority, and with time it
became evident that the model and intervention strategy of PRONASAR was not aligned
with the objectives and strategies of PNSR. The time and effort that it would take to
make this alignment and the cost involved (changing locations, new records, new works)
would not be justifiable, particularly given the short implementation time left before the
closing date.

8.      Therefore, the government decided to advance PRONASAR’s closing date to
June 2013. From January 2013, PRONASAR entered closure stage. Once the project is
closed, PNSR will be in charge of financing any on-going activities under the project
until their finalization. In order to utilize all of the available funds under the additional
financing loan (US$15.5 million), the government has requested that the percentage of
Bank financing for activities under Component 1 be increased from 60% to 100%, this
will apply to the implementation of contracts in execution.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

9.      Change closing date: The government has requested that the project’s closing
date be advanced from December 31, 2013 to June 30, 2013.

10.     Reallocation of funds for Loan No. 7142-PE: Although Loan No. 7142-PE has
been fully disbursed, the balances of other Categories need to be reallocated to Category
6 “Goods and works for Rural Subprojects?, which is overdrawn – in order to be able to
close the Loan. Below is the proposed reallocation of amounts between categories of
Loan No. 7142-PE:




                                             7
                                                             Allocation (US$)
 Category of Expenditure
                                                        Current               Revised
  (1) Goods and works for Community
 Subprojects under Parts A.1 and A.2 of the              1,100,000            1,080,733
 Project
 (2) Works for Small Town Subprojects
                                                         3,870,000            1,479,157
      under Part B of the Project
 (3) Goods (other than those for Community
                                                           865,000              826,214

 (4) Consultants’ services and audits
                                                        25,900,000           25,841,947
 (5) Fee
                                                           500,000              500,000

 (6) Goods and works for Rural Subprojects

 TOTAL AMOUNT                                           50,000,000           50,000,000

11.     Change in financing percentages for Loan No. 7978-PE: The percentage of
expenditures to be financed by the Bank corresponding to Categories 4 and 6 need to be
modified in order to allow for payments of all ongoing contracts to be made with 100%
of the Loans resources, allowing for the total execution of the remaining balance. Also a
reallocation between Loan categories is needed in order to reflect the activities that are
currently being financed under the Loan. The proposed reallocation is as follows:

                                      Amount of the Loan          Percentage of Expenditures
                                           Allocated                    to be financed
                Category              (expressed in USD)             (inclusive of Taxes)

 (1) Goods and works for
     Community Subprojects as                      --                   Not applicable
     defined in the Original Loan
     Agreement
 (2) Works for Small Town
     Subprojects as defined in the                 --                   Not applicable
     Original Loan Agreement
 (3) Goods (other than those for              300,000                       80%
     Rural Subprojects)
 (4) Consultants’ services and            7,500,000
     audits                                                                 100%
 (5) Fee payable under Section
     2.04 of the Original Loan                     --                   Not applicable

 (6) Goods and works for Rural           22,200,000                         100%
     Subprojects
 (7) Training                                      --                   Not applicable

 TOTAL AMOUNT                            30,000,000

                                               8
12.    A grace period of 4 months will be granted to the project to pay for goods and
services received and works executed before the new closing date.

13.     Risks. The proposed restructuring involves no other changes in terms of project
objectives, institutional, disbursement or procurement arrangements. The Loan
Agreements will be amended to reflect the changes proposed in this Restructuring Paper.
The Project Development Objective remains the same. However, it is anticipated to have
a reduced number, in terms of localities that will benefit from the project under
Component 1. Finally, the Government is committed to financing with their own
resources, all of the remaining activities under the project that will not be completed by
the new closing date.
