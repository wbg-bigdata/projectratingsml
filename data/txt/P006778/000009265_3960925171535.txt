MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Colombia
Aaricultural Research gnd Extension Proiect (Loan 230-CQ)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Colombia -Agricultural Research and
Extension Project (Loan 2303-CO) prepared by tie Latin America and the Caribbean Regional
Office. Part 11 of the report is a summary of a project completion report prepared by the
Borrower.
The project achieved its physical objectives, after substantial delays. It made a
significant contribution to strengthening the major Colombian research institution (ICA) and
increasing its production orientation. Its outcome is rated as satisfactory and its benefits as
sustainable, but there is uncertainty regarding future funding of ICA's operational costs.
The Project Completion Report Is barely satisfactory. It should have elaborated
on the private and public financing of the national research system and outlined the follow-up
steps needed to furthet enhance the quality and relevance of applied research in Colombia.
No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPREnON REPR
1.    Tis is fte Completion Report on the Agricultur and Extension Project I in Colombia
(Loan 2303-CO) for which a loan of US$63.4 million was approved on June 7, 1983. The legal
documents were signed on September 19, 1983 and the proect became effective on January 9,
1984. The original Closing Date for the Loan was June '3., 1990. Two extensions were
ganted, and the final Closing was June 30, 1992. Howevc, disbursements were authorized
through October 31, 1992.
2.    The project is the 14th loan for arculture in Colonbia since 1966. Although none of
the previous projects prvides eperience of direct relevance to this project, they enabled the
Bank to learn about the legal and aminisve  ms operating in this sector.
3.   This report was prepared by Country Department III, Agriculture, of the Lafin America
and the Caribbean Regional Office on the bads of a PCR prepared by ICA, the Colombian
Agricultural Institute, dated October 30, 1992. Other sources of finfmation for the Completion

EYALUflANM ISMMARY
Introduction and Objctiv
1.   This project was the 14th agriculhual project anced by the Bank in Colomnbia. The
project aimed at inceasing the capacity of dhe Colombian AgricItera Insdttute (ICA) to improve
and expand its research and technology transfer activities so as to assist the country in raising
its agricultural output at competitive costs by: (a) intensfying agricultural research for the most
inportant commodites;  (b) promoting the dissemination and application of results of
agricultural resech and carrying out studies to improve technology transfer; and (c) training
scientfic and technological personnel for sevice within ICA and the agriculturl sector as a
whole.
Implementation Eperience
2.   In general, the proect was iplemented in a sadsfacity manner. However, due mainly
to difficulties in counrpart financing and hiring feezes, both implementaton and disbursements
were far behind SAR projections and the completion and closing dates of the project had to be
extended by two years. Moreover, ICA, the implementing agency had great difflculty adapting
its cumbersome procedures so as to improve the speed of implementation. Nevertheless, the
overall project did succeed in meeting most of its targets, did contrbute to the development of
useful technology, and will, as a result, impove productivity and incase production.
Results
3.   In spite of difficulties and delays during ilemenion, the madority of physical tarpts
were met or exceeded;  (a) construction of a     research,   station and support
facilities at seventeen expeimental stations and two labtories; (b) equipment, materials and
furnishings for the new facilities built under the project, as wel as the replacement of worn out
equipment for the seventeen ICA staions; (c) purchase of means of t ortation for improving
the efficiency of the research progams, their admiistration and the disation of research
results through regional tWials and field days. The objectives for irs   high level staff have
been met, but not those for support staff. This was mainly due to rsing costs (infton) and
budgets restrictions. As a result, the ratio esearchsupport staff was not adequat and has led
to an ineffectve use of time of resrcher. The objecdves for consultant serices have been
fully achieved and indeed, surpassed with an increased hiring of locally recruitd consultants.
The results of a review done by ICA on consultant sevices provided indicated overal
satisfactory performance.
Sustainability
4. Most of the project achievements are liklly to be sustained for the foreseeable future as
integral part of the Colombia reseach system. Thus, the quesfion is not whether they will be
sustained, but at what level they wil be sustained. The principal challenges for the level of their
sustainability are pardy administativ and pardy financial; namely, wbether the Government
will successfully implement an effective maintnce system for resrch services in term of



- iv -
facilities, operating means, training, stamng, as wel as adequacy and quality of the technical
recommendations provided to the majority of farmers by the research and extension services.
If these challenges are not met and are coupled with shortages in operating means, sustainability
is unlikely to be at a high level.
5.    For future projects the fbllowing lessons leamed .rom implementation of this project may
be of value:
(a) the farming community as the ultimate users of the generated and disseminated
technologies should be involved at the early stages of preparation of the project
and later during its implementation to ensure the relevance and the adequacy of
the proposed research and extension programs. Rapid paricipatory assessments,
regular training sessions and regional workshops would be useful to ensure
participation of the farming community;
(b)   an agricultural research project should be focussed on improving the relevance
and quality of generated technologies. Even if the financing is proposed for
hardware components (namely civil works, equipment, vehicles) and/or training
of research personnel, it should spell out in its objectives some priority research
issues to be solved or at least addressed in a given timeframe and monitored in
a clear and measurable manner;
(c) given the budgetary dependance on often unstable and uncertain public funds, and
few available mechanisms to engage the private sector, the single national insdtute
model for agricultural research should evolve into a more comprehensive National
Research System, including public institutes, universities, and private firms;
(d)   the Research Institution(s) involved in a research prqect should devise legal
means for their financing, to strengthen the ability of producers' associations
andlor private firms to contract research programs responsive to their needs;
(e)   since three intemational agriculural reseach centers exist in the Latin America
region, namely CIAT in Colombia, CIMMT in Mexico, and CIP in Peru, the
National Research System in general and ICA in particular should be more
closely linked with them to take advantage of their results and to avoid dispersion
of efforts and possible overlaps;
(f)   given the increasing problems of sustainable agriculture and environmental issues,
agncultural research projects should also work on environmentally sound
technologies towards a sustnable eco-agriculture, which implies specific training
and skills to develop a "green* sensitivity throughout all research progms.

2.1   5=  D IlpenLD Oective. At the time the project was appraised in 1982 the
Goverment of Colombia accorded high priority to policies for agricultural and rural
development, recognizing that ample untapped potential existed for such development. More
rapid agricultural exnion was mtended to meet the goals of acdieving a fast rate of
economic growth, grea  price stability, export promotion, import substitution and more
employment generation.   Such emphasis, however, recognized the sectoral and
macroeconomic constraints that had been emeging in the 1980s: low international prices for
major exports, depressed domestic economy, lagging yields and profitability in the sector.



-2 -
2.2   Esicy Context In order to help realize the sector's potential and to restore its
competit.r4ness in intenional markets, the Government had reviewed policy options,
especially trade policies and policies in input and output pncing. In addition, incentives
were povided for production to check the rapid incrases In food prices. Towards these
goals, the Government sought to: (a) improve the technical and managerial efficiency of
agricultul producers; (b) strengthen the institutions and industries which supply technical
knowledge, inputs, and credit; and (c) increase the allocation of public resources in carefully
selected areas, such as generation and diffusion of agricultural technology, irrigation
development, watershed management, crop and livetock development, marketing, credit and
provision of inputs. The Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA) and the National Planning
Department analyzed the shortcomings of agricultural resh, with particular regard to food
crops, and presented recommendations on how to improve the existing situation with the
National Plan for Agricultural Research of ICA (PLANIA) which formed the basis of this
project. Furthermore, a similar comprehensive review was undertaken under the project for
the transfer and adoption of agricultural technology, in order to lead to a substantial
shortening of the time-lag between the development of agricultural technology and its
adoption.

3.1   aWeit oeys. The project aimed at increasing the capacity of the Colombian
Agriculua Institute (ICA) to improve and expand its research and technology transfer
acivities so as to assist the country in raising its agricultural output at competitive costs by:
(a) intensifying agricultural research for the most important commodities; (b) promoting the
dissemination and application of results of agricultural research and carrying out studies to
improve technology tansfer, and (c) taining scienific and technological personnel for
service within ICA and the agriculturl sector as a whole.
3.2   Project lZess;riptiQn. The proect comprised the following components to be carried
out by ICA over six years:
(a)   Resr Sttions:
(i)  the rehabilitation, development and equipping of 15 existing
agriltural research stations and two veterinary laboratones;
(ii) the establishment of one new agricultural and livestock research
station.
(b) Training-for about 270 staff at the post-graduate level over six years and
providig short courses for about 250 resrch and support staff over five
years.

(d)   Increment aQp      C-salaries and operating costs for five years for
about 300 new research staff and about 1,000 technical supoort staff, and a
salary premium for about 190 existing and about 230 new researh workers
with PhD and MS qualifications to attract and retain high-level staff.
(e)   Moitrng ad Evaluation-actvties to review and asses periodically the

(f)   Technology Transfer-review of the rational fann extension systems and the
prepaation of a plan and policy document (PLANTRA) as a basis for frther
improvement to the farm advisory services of ICA and other public and
private institutions.
4.    Petj  n aig5n ization
4.1   Based on the information available to the appraisal mission, the concepual foundation
for the project was appropriate and clear. The project's central thrust was to support
biological, physical, economic and social research on commodities of national - .nportance
and, at the same time promote the dissemination and application of agriculhtu  research to
raise the output of the agriculturl sector. This project was in line with OED's
recommendations concerning the Bank's epiene with the strengthening of ag- 'dturl
research and extension.
4.2   The project's timing and scope was appropriate in that it responded to clearly
arficulated national needs. The project was designed and appraised at a time of declinng
agncultural prodoctivity and economic growth. The Government's analysis of policy options
had concluded that investment in the rural sector was critical to reverse the declining rate
of economic growth, and that in particular it was necessary to improve the effectiveess of
the national resarch and extension services.
4.3   The project was carefully defined in the feasbility study prepared by ICA with
assistance from Bank missions that visited Colombia in April, June and September 1982.
The appraisal mission, comprsing seven persons, took plce in November/December 1982.
The project organization was straightforward with ICA as the implementing agency through
its established administrative and techimcal Divisions, coordinated by a Project Coordination
Unit formed for that purpose within the Office of Planning.

S.   Project Lmplementao
5.1   Loan Efe_ns and Pojc             . The loan was approved on June 7, 1983,
signed on September 19, 1983, and declared effective on January 9, 1984.
5.2  in general, the project was implemented in a satisfactory manner. However, due
mnainly to difficulties in counterpart financing and hiring feezes, both implementation and
disbursements were far behind SAR projections and the compledon and closing dates of the
project had to be extended by two years. Moreover, administtive procedures in ICA, the
implementng agency, proved more cumbersome than anticpated and ICA had great
difficulty adapting them so as to improve the speed of implementation. Nevertheless, the
overall project did succeed in meeting most of its targets, did contribute to the developmet
of useful technology, and will, as a result, improve productivity and increase production.
5.3   rWct Risks. Of the potential risks identified by the appraisal mission, only the
timely availability of counterpa  funds and the delay in the rehabilitation of the national
network of extension services, despite the preparation of PLANTRA, were of significant
importance and contributed to lower adoption rates of gtr rated technologies than
anticipated.
5.4   Untlreseen FactorsA ffecting Project ImplemenWtaion. Ihe new national policy
towards dehentrallzation had some delaying effects in implementing PLANTRA which,
however, has been used as the basis for fte proposed Techbiology Transfer project under
prparation to be financed by the Bank.
6.    Major Results of the Project.
6.1   Project Objcgi. Overall, the project was successful in meefing its principal
objective of improving and expanding ICA's research and technology transfer activities so
as to assist the country iLn raising its agricultural output at competitive costs. ICA has now
an enlarged cadre of trained research pesonnel at both the professional and support level
(see Annex m. paragraph 4). It has also an improved physical plant and is adequately
equipped to fulfill its mandate. Studies have been completed to improve the orientation and
prioritization of research activities, as well as to pave the way to a new national xtension
program. According to the 1991 exral review, the project had a major impact in
strengthening the organzation and producton orientation of Colombia's agricultural research.
ICA's research program has already generated much useful technology which has been
adopted by some farmers and, as a result, has improved productivity and increased
production. There is every reason to believe this process will continue provided that ICA
budget financing is adequate.



-5 -
6.2   P-hysica Results. In spite of difficulties and delays during implementation, the
majority of physical targets were met or exceeded: (a) construction of adequate reseach,
administration and support facilities at seventeen experimental stations and two laboratories;
(b) provision of equipment, materials and funishings for the new facilities built under the
project, as well as the replacement of worn out inefficient equipment for the seventeen ICA
stations; (c) purchase of means of transportation for improving the efficiency of the research
programs, their administration and the ssemination of research results through regional
trials and field days.
6.3 Human Resource Deyvlopment. Training and Technical Assistance. Human resource
increments have beeni less than planned at appraisal. This reduction in hiring incremental
staff was mainly due to rising costs (inflation) and budget restrictions. In retrospect, it was
a wise decision to prefer an "under' staffing, to keep a ratio of no more than 70% salary
costs and 30% for other operational costs. However, although the objectives for increasing
high level staff have been met, and sometimes surpassed (i.e., for the B.S. category), the
global reduction in hiring staff has been made at the expense of the hiring of support staff.
It has led to a ratio Researcher/Support Staff higher than 1, thus resulting in an ineffective
use of time of researcher. In spite of difficulties to send abroad suitable candidates for PhD
or MS, the targets for postgraduate mtining of ICA scientists have been mostly met. The
objectives for consultant services have been fully achieved and indeed, surpassed with an
increased hiring of locally recruited consultants. The results of a review done by ICA on
the Technical Assistance indicated overall satisfactory performance.
6.4   Project Impact and Benefits. Although it is not possible to esdmate the benefits of
a research project of this type in a sufficiently reliable manner to compute E  am  a
meaningful rate of return, according to the 1991 external review the project had a major
impact in strengthening the organization and production orientation of Colombia's
agricultural research. It also assisted ICA to consolidate its research efforts and helped
ensure continuity in the improvement of research planning and execution, and to strengthen
the linkages between research and extension services to cover sectorwide requirements for
technological improvements. In retrospect, overall research programs seem to have been
unbalanced, in favor of basic and strategic applied research rather than adaptive and on-fam
research. The research programs were based on a commodity approach which should bave
been complemented with Farming Systems research programs. Moreover, the evaluation of
the research programs and of their adequacy with the needs and constraints of the farming
community was weak and insufficient. The cost/benefit analyses of research programs and
the socio-economic analysis effects of the application of new technologies were not
undertaken in a systematic manner. If the overall evaluation of research programs had been
more producer-oriented and if implementation of the PLANTRA had started earlier, if only
as a pilot undertaking, the impact of the project and its benefits to farmers, especially small-
scale farmers, would have been most likely greater.

6.SPrect Administrtion.
(a)   Prject Costs, The estimated cost of the project at apprisal was about
US$206.6 million. The final project cost is estimated at about US$173
milion.
(b)   DijmrmXnIa. The estimated and act6al disbursements of the Loan 2303-CO
are given in Table 3 in Part m. The disbursements were slow due to delays
in implementation of the project. The original closing date was June "1, 1990;
but the loan was closed only on June 30, 1992, after two extensiias of the
closing date of the loan. Disbursement agains commitments up to June 30,
1992 were made untl October 31, 1992 and an outstanding balance of
US$870,164.41 was canceled.
(c)   Loan Alloaio.  The odginal and revised allocations and actual
disbursements for Loan 2303-CO are shown in Table 5 in Part IIL. The
original allocations were revised in November 1987, in January 1989, and in
June 1991, to reflect chges in financing for civil works, incremental
operating costs and trining (the fill cost of the the Civil Works and Station
Development components in particular, as calculated in the SAR, was largely
undrestimated in Schedule I of the Loan Agreement).
(d)   Prrment. Procurement of equipment and vehicles was slow due to the
Government's cumbersome administrafive regulations for procrement. I
geneal, the procurement action followed Bank guidelines.
(e)   Auditing and  porting. At the end of each fiscal year, ICA was to send to
the Bank audits of the project accounts and related basic financial statements,
prepared by independent auditors, satisfactory to the Bank. ICA fulfilled this
requirement although with consstent delays. ICA was to establish and
maintain a system of monitoring the progress of the project and evaluating
research results for each progam and staion, and their levance to the needs
of the farming community. ICA fufilled the task and has produced valuable
information through half-yearly progress reports. However, the evaluation of
the reserch programs and of their adequacy with the needs and constraints
of the farning community was weak and insufficient. The cost/benefit
analyses of research progams and the socio-economic analysis effects of the
application of new technologies were not undertaken in a systematic manner.



-7-
7.  Sustaiailt
7.1   Most of the project achievements are likely to be sustained for the foreseeable fuure
as integral parts of the Colombia research technology transfer system. Thus, the question
is not whether they will be sustained, but at what level they will be sustained. The principal
challenges for the level of their sustainability are partly administrative and partly financial;
namely, whether the Government will successfully implement an effective maintenance
system for research services in terms of facilies, operating means, training, staffing, as well
as adequacy and quality of the technical recommendations provided to the majority of
farmers by the research and extension smices. If these challenges are not met and arm
coupled with shortages in operating means, sustinability is unikely to be at a high level.
7.2 To ensure that these efforts will be sustained in Colombia, the farming community
should be more involved in the planning and budgetary process of research prograns. The
1990 revision in law allowed the public institutes, including ICA, to mae legal contracts
with other public or pnvate economic agents. With prvate, Government and external
financing, some sort of Research Foundation should be set up to allow the farming
community to participate in the selecdon of research projects. The exerience learned
through the on-going Bank financed Rural Development Investment project (Lo. 3250-CO)
would help. Also, better lnkages between ICA and the international agricultural research
centers (IARCs) should be sought to take advantage of the IARCs results and to avoid
dispersion of efforts and possible overlaps. Moreover, the proposed Technology Transfer

8.1   Bank PerfQrnmar1. ITe Bank's performance was satisfctory throughout project
implementation. Relations between the Bank and ICA were cordial at all times and the Bank
acted supportively and flexibly to resolve project problems or to respond to changing
circumstances in Colombia.  The following actions contributed to  icoessful project
implementation: (a) reallocation of funds between categories on January 31, 1989, on June
14, 1991 and on June 24, 1992; (b) agreement to abandon the Scientific Premia component
and reallocation of the funds for training consistent with the objective of the Scientific
Premia of providing the incentives needed to attract and retain quad  research staff; (c)
two one-year extensions of the loan closing date which allowed ICA to complete the civil
works program and the post graduate taining program. Bank supervion missions were
well-timed, however the supervision missions could have benefitted from stronger
participation of research specialists. The quality and elevarce of ICA's research programs
should have been more closely monitored, which might have helped strengthen the applied
aspects of research.

8.2   Borrower Performance.    All major loan covenants were complied with Crable 7),
although some were met with slight delays on occasion and one (Scientific Premia LA #3.06
Annex 1, Part 4c) was waived in agreement with the Bank. In spite of the changes in senior
management, overall ICA perfomed well. Delays in the execution of the civil worls
program were mainly due to lack of experienced staff in this area. As in the preceding
Bank-assisted agricultural projects, the project encountered difficulties in obtaining
counterpart funds on a timely basis. This was the most notable exception to an otherwise
very satisfactory Borrower performance.
8.3   Lessons aI d.   For future projects the following lessons leamed from
implementation of this project may be of value:
(a)   the farming community as the ultimate users of the generated and
disseminated technologies should be involved at the early stages of preparation
of the project and later during its implementation to ensure the relevance and
the adequacy of the proposed research and extension programs;
(b) an agricultural research project should be focussed on improving the relevance
and quality of generated technologies. Even if financing is pruposed for
hardware components (namely civil works, equipment, vehicles) and/or
training of research personnel, research projects should spell out among their
objectives some priority research issues to be solved or at least addressed in
a given timeframe. Moreover, these priority research issues should be
defined so that they can be monitored in a clear and measurable manner
(prionty-setting and monitoring methods such as: checklists, congruence,
scoring, domestic resource cost ratios, beneWitlcost analyss, mathematical
programming, systems analysis and simulation models, etc...);
(c) given the budgetary dependance on often unstable and uncertain public funds,
and the few available mechanisms to engage the private sector, the single
national institute model for agricultural research should evolve into a more
comprehensive National Research System, including public institutes,
universities and private firms;
(d)   the Research Institution(s) involved in a research project should devise legal
means, to strengthen the ability of producers' associations and/or private firms
to participate in the financing of research programs and to contract research
programs responsive to their needs;
(e)   since three international agricultural research centers exist in the Latin
America region, namely CIAT in Colombia, CIMMYT in Mexico, and CIP
in Peru, the National Research Systems should be more closely linked with



- 9 -
them to take advantage of their results and to avoid dispersion of efforts and
possible overlaps;
(I)   given the increasing problems of susinable agriculture and envimrmental
issues, agricultural resarch projects should also work on environmentally
sound technologies towards a sustainahle eco-agriculture, which implies
specific training and sildls to develop a wgreenw sensitivity thoghout all
research programs.
9.    Pject Relationship
9.1   Bank staff and officials of the Borrower involved in the implementation of the project
enjoyed an amiable and highly professional worlkng relationship. These factors contributed
to the success of the project.
10.   Consulting Services
10.1 Objectives in this area have been fully achieved and, indeed, surpassed with an
increased hiring of locally recruited consultants. Their sustained contribution depends
greatly on the depth of knowledge and training imparted to their counterpart(s) during the
consultancy period. However, some shortls did occur due to lack of adequate facilities,
ambiguous terms of reference, and/or vague contal arrangements.

SUMMARY
In 1981 the DNF prepared a document called 'Basis for the National Research Plan in
the Agriculture, Cattle, Forestry and Fishery Sectors," incorporating a wide content of
PLANIA. The Plan was approved by CONPES in November 1981. It demonstrated the
government's deternmnation to rehabilitate the national agricultural and cattle research
capacity and to establish administrative and financial systems to support long-term
investigation with the participation of the private and public sectors.
At that time, the Colombian Government requested the World Bank to finance the
first phase of a program to stengthen the national agriculture and catde research capacity,
and the extension services through a loan to ICA. The project was submitted to the World
Bank for negotiations in October 1982, after three World Bank missions to Colombia on
April, June and September.
The Loan Agreement 2303-CO between ICA and the World Bank, Project I -
Agiculture and Catte Research and Extension, was signed as scheduled on
September 19, 1983 for an amount of US$63.4 million and was declared effective as of
January 19, 1984 for a period of 8 1/2 years, with a closing date of June 30, 1992 as agreed
with the Bank.
The project contributed to the modernization of ICA's infrastructure and the training
of its staff. ICA's capability to generate technology was also enhanced through the
construction and upgrading of new buildings in different regions of the country, together with
new machinery, equipment and vehicles.
Among the construction carried out, it is worth mentioning the Biosecurity
Laboratories, the Health and Animal Production Research Center, and the Animal Science,
Biotechnology and Health Research Center (CEISA).
To support the agricultural research and the new developments in special and
biotechnology projects, two modern agricultural laboratories were built in Tibaitata -Region
1- and Palmira -Region 5- and the agricultural laboratory in the Libertad, Vilavicencio.
The construction of a printing shop (TaUler de Medios de Impresi6n) is underway in
Tibaitata.
In addition, land improvements, drainage, irrigation, roads, and services such as
sewerage, electricity, and communication systems were built.
Research equipment was purchased: two high technology electronic microscopes, and
X-ray difactometers, spectrophotometers, and a phytotron. Also, modern data processing
equipment was purchased to substantally upgrade the processing of technical information.
One hundred nine (109) Tractors, 50 light transportation vehicles and 53 heavy
transportation vehicles were distributed among the different regions.



-13-
Fifty eight (58) staff received PhD degrees, 132 Master degrees, 9 Sabbaticals, 65
short courses abroad, and 488 courses in the country. One hundred seventy four (174)
man/months consultancy services were provided by local and foreign professionals in
technical, administrative and managerial areas.
Through the loan, the Agriculture and Cattle Library in Tibaitata purchased 1,500
periodicals and about 12,000 books, making it possible to modernize the data available to
ICA professionals, and to substantially improve the informafion services provided to outside
users.
