MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US $325 million to help finance a Telecommunications
Sector Modernization Project. This fifth operation for telecommunications development in Indonesia, which
probably will be the last Bank loan in the sector, will be lent at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with a
maturity of 20 years including 5 years' grace. Out of the proceeds of the loan, $317 million would be on-lent
to PT. Telekomunikasi Indonesia (TELKOM) for 20 years including 5 years grace, under the same terms as
the Bank loan plus 0.5 percent per annum. TELKOM would bear the foreign exchange risk. The project is
expected to be co-financed by Germany (KfW) for $95 million equivalent, France for $62 million equivalent,
Japan for $305 million equivalent (OECF $264 million and EXIM Bank $41 million) and $42.0 million from
EXIM Bank USA.
2.         Background. Since the mid-1980's, the Bank has made three loans to the sector: the Technical
Assistance Project in 1986; and the Third and Fourth Telecommunications Projects in 1990 and 1992,
respectively. These loans supported the commercialization of TELKOM and contributed to its impressive
physical performance improvements during 1988-94: annual investment increased from about $340 million to
over $1 billion; the rate of network growth accelerated from 8 percent per annum to over 20 percent per
annum; the rate of long-distance call completion improved from 19 percent to 36 percent; and labor
productivity increased from 20 to 50 lines per employee. TELKOM is now able to have the audit of its
accounts completed within two months compared to over 14 months. The Bank's dialogue with the GOI in
the context of preparation and implementation of the Third and Fourth projects has contributed to these
improvements in a major way. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain.
Strategic Sector Issues
3.         The Challenges. Demand for telephones still exceeds supply; sophisticated telecommunications
services - which are needed for businesses to compete in the global market place - are in their infancy; the
efficiency of operations remains low; and service quality and reliability are below that of well dimensioned
networks. To overcome these constraints to sustained industrial and export growth and regional development.
actions are required on the following: (a) mobilizing on attractive terms the capital needed for massive
investments to accelerate network expansion; (b) ensuring world class operator participation to fully harness
the benefits of emerging technology and modern operating practices; (c) improving regional service delivery
through effective decentralization; and (d) developing TELKOM into a modern, efficient and business-
oriented company.



2
4.         Private Sector Participation. Meeting the financial, managerial and technical requirements of a
competitive telecommunications sector development are predicated upon private sector participation. Hence,
there is a need to create an appropriate framework for efficient private sector participation which creates both
the capacity and incentives for excellent performance. Creating such an environment will require major
organizational changes in TELKOM that would pave the way for strategic alliances with first-class
international telecommunications operators.
5.         Enabling Environment.  With the emergence of a significant role for private investors and
operators, regulatory oversight will need to be strengthened.  First, the GOI needs to review  the
telecommunications law that has mandated TELKOM and/or INDOSAT equity stakes in all basic service
providers and thereby stifled the development of competition in the sector. Second. MTPT's capacity to
monitor the performance of operators, to impose penalties for poor performance and to respond in a timely
way to new regulatory issues, needs to be significantly strengthened.
6.         Tariffs. A key goal of opening the telecommunications sector to private participation is to bring
the provision of services in all parts of Indonesia up to internationally competitive levels in terms of price and
performance. Accordingly, the future tariff policy should provide operators an incentive for cost efficiency
and ensure that benefits of efficiency gains are shared equitably by both customers and investors. Inefficiency
should not be shielded by accommodating tariff adjustments.
Government Objectives and Strategy
7.         Objectives. The GOI recognizes that, because information has become a fundamental factor of
production, adequate telecommunications infrastructure and services are key prerequisites for economic
development. Thus, the GOI considers telecommunications a strategic investment for the Indonesian economy
to maintain a competitive advantage and to participate effectively in the global economy. Furthermore, the
GOI recognizes that telecommunications can play a key role in regional development and delivery of social
services. Commensurate with these considerations, the GOI intends to improve rapidly the quality and
coverage of telecommunication services, while reducing the costs, so as to match the telecommunications
performance standards of its East Asian economic competitors. In particular, the GOI's objectives are to
substantially eliminate unmet demand for service by planning for the construction of a minimum five million
additional lines during 1994-1999, a prerequisite for upgrading sector performance to world-class standards.
8.         Strategy. The strategy to achieve these objectives constitutes a fundamental departure from past
practices in that the GOI will be relying mainly on private sector investment and expertise, in an increasingly
competitive, multi-operator environment. This strategy, outlined below, which has already been initiated by
the GOI, involves large scale Build/Joint-Operate/Transfer Schemes (JOS), partial privatization initiatives,
increased competition, and development of the legal and regulatory environment for the sector. The GOI has
furnished to the Bank a Policy Letter which elaborates its strategy for development of the telecommunications
sector. This letter forms the basis for implementing the telecommunications sector agenda and associated
Bank support.
Private Entry
9.         Joint Operation Schemes.  The GOI is in the process of establishing JOS contracts between
TELKOM and private consortia for the provision of local telecommunications services in five of the seven
regions. The JOS will involve the construction, during REPELITA VI, of a minimum of two million new
lines (with an investment cost of approximately US $2 billion) by private consortia that include first-class
foreign operators, and the operation of both new and existing local network facilities on an integrated basis in
these five regions, which comprise about 40 percent of the overall market (see Map 26332). The consortia
will be granted limited exclusivity, until 1999, for the provision of fixed local telephone services in their
regions. Separate authorizations would be required for the JOS consortia to provide other services. The



3
prequalification of private consortia was completed in September 1994.1  The JOS bids were opened in the
presence of representatives of all bidders on March 21, 1995, and the contents of Bid Summary Forms were
read out. The success of this process hinges on how well the next steps are managed: (a) the selection of the
five consortia; (b) completion of negotiations and finalization of contracts with the five consortia; and (c)
monitoring the JOS operators' performance.
10.        Privatization.  The Government selected INDOSAT as the flag bearer for its fledgling
privatization program across various sectors. INDOSAT successfully placed approximately 32 percent of its
shares to public shareholders through its initial public offering in October 1994. These shares are listed and
traded on the New York and Jakarta stock exchanges. TELKOM is expected to follow with a similar partial
privatization during REPELITA VI. This will be a positive development since the stock exchange disclosure
requirements and the vigilance of institutional investors will enhance the business orientation of TELKOM's
management.
Enabling Environment
11.        Legal Framework.  The importance of providing benefits to customers as well as giving
incentives for private participation highlights the need to build on the earlier reforms to the
Telecommunications Law in 1989. The GOI recognizes that this reform process needs to be conducted with a
view to developing regulatory oversight of the sector that fairly balances the interests of the GOI, consumers,
investors, financiers and operators in the emerging multi-operator environment. The first stage of this process,
involving an examination of international best practice in telecommunications regulation, an analysis of the
shortcomings of the existing legal framework, and development of recommendations for legal and regulatory
reform, is already underway. Technical assistance is provided under the proposed project to help develop the
legal and regulatory framework to further promote efficient private sector participation in the
telecommunications sector.
12.        Regulation. The GOI is planning to proceed gradually with the institutional development of the
regulatory function. The immediate and most important step is to build a regulatory framework on the basis of
clear-cut contractual arrangements with the new entrants into the telecommunications sector, which is being
done satisfactorily under the present institutional arrangements. The creation of JOS is establishing regulatory
mechanisms by specifying rights and obligations through contracts on key issues - the period of agreement, the
responsibility for the assets used, the extent of competition, the pricing of the services and the quality of
service to be achieved. These contracts will determine how benefits and risks will be shared among
TELKOM, the private sector party, and the customers. Furthermore, in a move to establish independent
regulatory oversight in the Ministry, all TELKOM staff, who had been seconded to the Ministry, have now
returned to TELKOM. A program to upgrade the technical capabilities of the Ministry's regulatory activities
is in place and will be further strengthened by this project.
Tariff Policies
13.        The GOI recognizes that appropriate tariffs are key elements of maintaining an environment in
the sector that is attractive for investors, provides incentives for efficiency, and protects customer interests, and
which thereby contributes to the international competitiveness of the Indonesian economy. Therefore, the GOI
has decided that, in reviewing TELKOM's tariffs periodically (in principle every three years), to use as a
/ Prequalified consortia, each comprised of both Indonesian investors and one or more foreign operators,
including: ATI-Alberta (Canada), Bell Canada, Cable and Wireless (U.K.), Deutsche Telekom, France
Telecom, GTE (USA), Korean Telecom, New Zealand Telecom, Nynex (USA), NTT (Japan), Malaysia
Telekom, Singapore Telecom, and Telstra (Australia).



4
comparator the performance of the highest efficiency service provider operating in Indonesia and in
Indonesia's competitor countries in the East Asia region while taking into accountthe requirements of
telecommunications operators in Indonesia to attract capital for future construction and expansion. Thus, the
tariff setting will be performance based and applied uniformly to all. As a result of this approach, one would
see significant real reductions in the overall level of tariffs for basic telecommunications services.
Bank Group Role
14.       Lessons Learned from Bank Involvement. The TA Loan of 1986 was the Bank's second
operation, after a 10-year hiatus, in Indonesia's telecommunications sector. The project was successful in
achieving its two main objectives: (a) helping TELKOM to improve its project implementation capacity while
reducing unit investment costs; and (b) paving the way for Bank investment financing (subsequent lending
operations in 1990 and 1992 totaled US $725 million), as well as substantial informal and formal sector work.
The Performance Audit Report No. 13229 (June 1994) on the TA Project concluded that the Bank approach to
sector support had proven quite effective, given that the GOI at that time was not ready to embark on a fast-
track program for sector reform. International experience suggests that: (a) In countries with a small base of
telephones, divestiture and privatization of the incumbent monopolist is, at best, a partial solution to closing
the gap between demand and supply. More important than this "top-down" approach are likely to be various
"bottom-up" approaches, funded by a mix of public and private capital, involving new concessions to
independent wireline and wireless (cellular radio) telephone companies, build-transfer schemes and joint
ventures; and (b) Among the various options for introducing fresh management and technical expertise
(management contracts, joint venture and privatization) into the sector, the most potent approach is for leading
international telecommunications operators to make an equity investment in the sector operations. Such
operators can bring hands-on experience and highly developed management systems to the development of
local human resources, skills and institutional capabilities. The proposed project design takes these lessons
into account.
15.       IFC Involvement. The Bank has maintained a close dialogue with IFC in respect of private entry
into the telecommunications sector in Indonesia, in particular, with respect to the Joint Operations Schemes.
IFC has indicated that the JOS concept, which has been structured to provide for competitive private sector
entry, would constitute a promising opportunity for IFC. Such an opportunity had not existed in the past. IFC
has already held preliminary discussions with a number of JOS bidders and anticipates involvement in some of
the JOS consortia.
16.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project would culminate long-standing Bank
support for modernizing Indonesia's telecommunications sector. It forms an integral part of the Bank's
assistance to Indonesia. By enhancing the competitiveness of the Indonesian economy through accelerated
deregulation, increased private sector participation, reduced cost of finance and provision of better
infrastructure services, the proposed project would support directly the various key objectiveness of the Bank
assistance strategy for Indonesia (Country Assistance Strategy was discussed by the Board on March 21,
1995). Specifically, the project would assist in the creation of an enabling environment and appropriate
framework for competitive entry of private investors and operators, while helping TELKOM to further reduce
investment costs by financing priority investment in advanced technologies. The GOI's reform agenda is
consistent with the Bank's approach to telecommunications development which advocates commercializing
operations. encouraging new entrants and competition, increasing private participation, and shifting the role of
government from ownership and operation to policy and regulation. The Bank has played a critical role in
promoting this reform agenda in Indonesia and expectation of the proposed Bank loan has figured prominently
in the GOI's decisions on sector reform. The GOI would like to see continued Bank involvement in the sector
because of the Bank's track record of providing quality assistance in supporting the GOI's reform program.



5
The GOI also values the Bank as a unique source of cross-country experience, as a stabilizing factor in helping
oversee major players, and in mitigating the risk of policy reversals.
Project Objective and Description
17.       Project Objective. The project supports the GOI's telecommunications sector reform program
which is based on three key elements: entry of world-class operators, competition in all segments of the sector
and reorganization of the established public service provider.
18.       Project Description. The proposed project, to be implemented during 1995-97, is an integral
part of the GOI's REPELITA  VI investment program  for telecommunications.  The project's three
components are:
(a)   Policy component: fully financed by the Bank, would provide policy support and capacity
building including: (i) reviewing and developing as appropriate the telecommunications legal and
regulatory environment to ensure effective entry of private investors and operators in the
telecommunications sector; (ii) strengthening MTPT's capability to manage regulatory issues
including monitoring and evaluating operators' performance in the emerging multi-operator
environment, and training of MTPT staff; (iii) reviewing the management and allocation of radio
frequency spectrum management to ensure efficient use of the spectrum and appropriate use of
modem technology; and (iv) developing a plan for the provision of rural telephone services on a
commercial basis.
(b)   Technical Assistance component: fully financed by TELKOM, would support: (i) strengthening
the project implementation, marketing, customer services and managerial capacities of TELKOM
through the provision of specialized marketing and managerial services; and (ii) improving
TELKOM's managerial capabilities through the implementation of its ongoing restructuring
program.
(c)   Investment component:  partly financed by the Bank and to be implemented over three years
(1995-97), would support further improvements in quantity and quality of service and network
modernization, including: (i) installation of local and inter-exchange networks based on the latest
technology to utilize effectively an additional one million lines of switching capacity in Jakarta
and Surabaya; (ii) installation of a second fiber optic backbone system between Jakarta and
Surabaya; (iii) installation of submarine optical fiber cable transmission systems to upgrade
transmission facilities to Kalimantan and Sulawesi; and (iv) enhancement of information systems
to improve TELKOM's business processes.
The project complements and supports the JOS operations through which private investors and operators will
install a minimum of two million additional telephone lines and operate both the new and existing network in
the regions outside Jakarta and Surabaya under stringent performance requirements (para 9). As a result of
these and other initiatives, Indonesia's telephone density will increase from about 1.26 in 1994 to 3.5 per 100
inhabitants at the end of REPELITA VI in 1999.
19.       A breakdown of the costs and the financing plan of the project are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of the Bank Group's operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13874-IND dated May 18,
1995, is being distributed separately.

20.        Project Implementation. Responsibility for implementing the sector reform component of the
project would be primarily with MTPT. The technical assistance investnent components would be executed
by TELKOM. Installation of all new facilities and network construction financed by the Bank will be carried
out by contractors on a single responsibility basis.
21.        Project Sustainability. Three relevant dimensions of sustainability for this project are: (a)
TELKOM's ability to effectively manage, operate and maintain major new network expansion. TELKOM's
management has a proven track record with continuous significant improvements in performance over the last
five years. It is well equipped to handle future challenges, particularly now that its responsibility will be
concentrated on the Jakarta and Surabaya regions; (b) robustness of the emerging competitive environment.
The introduction of multi-operator structures throughout the sector, combined with the entry of reputed
international telecommunications operators and international best practices is expected to create an irreversible
trend towards competition in all segments of the sector; and (c) performance of the Joint Operation Schemes.
With respect to the major JOS initiative which is supported by this project, the sustainibility of high
performance is reinforced by the participation of reputed international operators with requisite financing.
Vesting responsibility for the performance of both new and existing assets with these operators will allow the
streamlining of business processes and provide incentives for the new managers to improve the performance of
existing as well as new assets.
22.        Actions Agreed During Negotiations. (a) The GOI will: (i) cause TELKOM to finalize and
sign the JOS contracts not later than January 31, 1996; (ii) by June 30, 1996, appoint qualified consultants to
assist DGPT to monitor and evaluate the performance of TELKOM and the JOS operations under the JOS
contracts and furnish to the Bank consultants' report by June 30 of each year commencing June 30, 1997; (iii)
prior to carrying out full or partial divestiture of TELKOM or the sale of TELKOM shares in major joint
venture companies providing basic telecommunications services, afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to
exchange views with GOI and TELKOM on such proposed divestiture or sale; and (iv) prior to approving
tariff revisions to principal tariffs for basic telecommunications services, afford the Bank a reasonable
opportunity to exchange views on such proposed revisions. (b) TELKOM will: (i) sign contracts, not later
than January 31, 1996, with the selected five JOS consortia; and (ii) maintain debt service coverage of 1.5
and generate from net internal sources a minimum of 50 percent of its annual average of capital expenditures
incurred, or expected to be incurred, for that year and the following fiscal year.  As a Condition of
Effectiveness, the Government agreed to execute a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and
TELKOM satisfactory to the Bank.
23.        Environmental Aspects.  The use of environmentally friendly approaches will be adopted to
install conduits without surface excavation. This will minimize vehicular and pedestrian traffic disruption
while laying cables for local networks. The long distance fiber optic cables will be buried mostly along
existing roads and river crossings, so no disruption of virgin land is expected. The laying of submarine cable
is not expected to cause any environmental problems. Therefore, the project has been given a "B"
environmental rating.
24.        Program Objective Categories. The reform component of the project will lead to increased
private participation and investment in the telecommunications business, as well as contribute to the
development of domestic capital and financial markets which are expected to finance an increasing proportion
of telecommunications investment (para. 9).
25.        Project Benefits. The proposed project will support the implementation of an ongoing reform
agenda with profound effects on market structure, service coverage and regulatory environment, all aimed
at bringing the performance of the Indonesian telecommunications sector to international competitive levels.
The licensing of five consortia, each tied to a world-class telecommunications operator, to provide local



7
telephone services in five regions of Indonesia will generate dynamic effects towards increasing competition
in various market segments and developing an effective regulatory environment. The award of these
licenses to the private sector through a transparent and competitive bidding process, the establishment of
clearly defined performance targets for service quality throughout the country and the establishment of
effective performance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms will not only contribute to the development
of high quality low cost telecommunication systems throughout Indonesia, but also establish a precedent for
emulation in other Indonesian infrastructure sectors. Likewise, other elements of the reform agenda, i.e.
the review of the Telecommunications Law, planned partial privatization of TELKOM, and the development
of pilot projects for improved delivery of rural telephone services, will each contribute to improved sector
performance. Taken together these various elements of reform will lead to a substantially increased role for
the private sector, a more competitive TELKOM and the evolution of a multi-operator environment.
26.        Project Risks. Based on the past successful experience with Bank projects, the implementation
of the physical components by TELKOM and achievement of the associated benefits essentially do not present
any significant risks. However, there are risks in the implementation of the reform program in respect of: (i)
transparency of selection and award process of the JOS; and (ii) incentives for efficiency improvements,
achievement of performance targets and sharing benefits with customers. The quality of the requests for
proposals (RFP), issued to 12 pre-qualified consortia, and the process to respond to bidders' questions and
opening of bids (on March 21, 1995) in the presence of representatives of all bidders, have demonstrated
MTPT's commitment to a transparent selection and award process. Similarly, the GOI has signaled in the
clarification to the RFP that the GOI's overriding objective in proceeding with the JOS is to bring the
provision of telecommunications services in all parts of Indonesia up to internationally competitive levels in
terms of range of services, availability, quality, and price. Thus, the GOI has linked explicitly the justification
of reform to performance improvements and customer benefits. Specifically, in reviewing tariff proposals
from JOS operators, the GOI will eschew a "cost-plus" approach by using the highest efficiency performance
in the sector in Indonesia and in other competitor countries in the region as benchmarks.
27.        Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
