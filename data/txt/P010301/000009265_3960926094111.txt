9HOPA'WN4 AND 8ECOMMFMNATIO'N QF THE PR1PSIDFNT
OF THE INTFRNATIONAL RANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO TqfI EXECIUTIVE nlRECTORS ON A PROPOSEYD LOAN TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF- PAISTAN
FOR A CEMENT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
le        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
for IJS$96 million to the IsTlamic Republic cf Pakistan is submitted for
approval. The loan would be for a term of 20 years, including a 5-year
grace period, at the Rank's standard variable interest rate, and would help
the modernization of the country's cement industry. The Government of
Pakistan (GOP) will relend the entire loan to the State Cement Corporation
of Pakistan (SCCP), at an interest rate of 14% per annum, with a maturity
of 11 years, including a 4-year grace period.
Rackground
2.        Pakistan has substantial and widely dispersed raw material
deposits for cement production, and the industry is well-established,
accounting for about 5.5t of total industrial production and 1.4% of GDP.
Currently the industry has 7.7 million tons per year (mtpy) capacity,
comprisIng 13 SCCP plants (about 80% of total capacity) and four private
plants, and produced 6.4 million tons in 1Q86!87.
3.        The cement industry in Pakistan Is economically and financially
viable as demonstrated by the fact that the domestic resource cost
coefficient for the industrv is less than one and effectlve protection is
negative. However, falling world prices have reduced its international
cost competitiveness and the in&tstry is in need of restructuring and
modernization.  Following nationalization of all cement companies in 1972
and the creation of SCCP in 1973, the industrv stagnated for lack of funds,
and did not adopt the modern technology applied in most countries as a
response to the energv crisis. rrom belng a cement exporter In the early
1970s, Pakistan became a net importer by 1976. This prompted GOP to lift
the ban on private investment in 1978, and to authorize SCCP to invest in
new plants and modernization of others. Since then, SCCP has commissioned
four modern dry process plants and expanded two other plants, and private
investors have established four dry process plants, which now provide about
one-fifth of sector production.
4.        As a result, production has nearly caught up with domestic demand
in overall terms, but regional imbalances exist. Too many plants have been
located in the South, partly because of the past policy of cost-plus
prlcing, guaranteed return on equity, and freight equalization, and also
because political and provincial considerations overrode market and
transport factors. Moreover, only two of the new plants are large enough
to secure scale economies made possible by modern technology, and in spite
of the many new investments, more than half of Pakistan's cement production
Is still based on wet-process plants and undersized kilns.
5.        Direct Rank involvement In the subsector began in 19R2 with a
subsector mission whose report identified a number of weaknesses:



(a) priclng policies inhiblting efficlent resource allocatlon;
(b) technological obsolescence of manv qCCP plants and declining
competitiveness; and (c) an unsophisticated In4ustry with poor marketing
and distrlhutlon svstems, and inadequate training, research, and market and
product development. The report recommended: reliance on
market-determined prices and gradual elimination of cost-plus pricing and
guaranteed returns for producers; selective upgrading of SCP plants based
on modern technologv; management and plannlng Improvements in SCCP; and
sector wide development of tralning, research and marketing.  The Bank
agreed to consider financing investments in the cement lndustry if GOP
introduced policy reforms to permit market determinatton of prices for both
public and private plants.
6.        In Mav 1985, GOP Introduced some major policy changes affecting
the cement industry: (a) abandonment of cost-plus pricing for private
producers and elimination of all controls on retail sales;
(b) liberalization of private sector imports of cement, subject to an
import dutv, and the withdrawal of SCCP from cement Imports;
(c) removal of the cement industrv from the list of industries requiring
prior sanctlon bv GflP for investment, and the transfer of proiect approval
authoritv to financial organlzations; and (d) increased flexibility in
SCrP's pricing oractices and elimination of freight equalization.
Subsequently, COP indicated Its intention to reduce the share of the public
sector In the cement industry by allowing only the private sector to carrv
out greenfield proiects and limiting SCCP to modernization, rationalization
and rehabilitation of existing facilities. tn addition, GOP has included
cement in the list of subsectors In which private shareholdings in state
enterprises are to be encouraged,
7.        In the space of a year and a half, the policy reforms and the
entry of private producers have created a more competitive market, with
decreases in real prices In the South, discounts for quantity purchases and
increased advertising and brand differentiation. Two private producers are
alreadv planning plant expansions to lower their unit costs. Because of
the growth of Production in the orivate sector plants 8CCP is facing
pressure on its market share and Is now developing marketing strategies
offering increased flexibility for plant managers in pricing and marketing
decisions. 'the policy changes have also affected production and investment
decisions, with investors paving more attention to market needs and plant
size.
Project Objectives
R.        the overall obiective of the proposed project is to support
further the rational developmient of the cement subsector, given that an
appropriate policy framework has now been established. Since the irivate
sector plants are new and have not yet reached full production, the project
focusses upon SCCP, the largest producer, most of whose plants urgently
need modernization and rationalization. The specific objectives are:
(a) to finance high-priority rehabilitation of SCCP plants as a first step
in rationalizing SCCP's facilities in the long term; (b) to lmprove SCCP's
management and operatlons and to increase its commercial orientatlon



through (i) preparation and implementation of a Corporate Strategy,
(ii) management and technical training, and (iii) proiect implementatlon
assistance; and (c) to establish a Cement Pesearch Institute. It is
envisaged that the private sector would also benefit from the tec&nical
training component.
Proiect Dlescription
9.        the orolect consists of five components:  (i) conversion of the
TJah plant from wet to dry process (resulting in a capacity increase of
500,nOn tons ver year); (ii) mdnor rehabllitation of five wet-orocess
plants, Including installation of pollution control equipment;
(iii) development and implementation of SCCP's Corporate Strategy, and the
design and imolementation of a Management Information Svstem; (iv) design
of a training program and redesign of tralning facilities; and
(v) establishment of a Cement Wesearcb Institute. The rorlect would be
imolemented over a four-year period beginning in FY85. the total project
cost is estimated at T91S164.4 million ecuivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of VSS105.6 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and method of orocurement, the allocation
of the Bank loan and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of kev proiect processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
showing the location of plants is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report (Report No. 6707-PAN) dated September 30, 1917 is being circulated
separately.
Rationale for Rank Involvement
10.       By its recent actions, GOP has shown its willingness to address
maJor subsector issues and to expose SCCP to competition, as was
recommended in the Bank's subsector review. By allowing private
participation in production, import and sale of cement in a free market,
GOP has created an environment conducive to more efficient resource
allocation and utilization. This has already had positive effects upon
prices, investment decisions and, to a limited extent, SCrP's corporate
policies. These wide-ranging reforms would probably not have been
undertaken without the Rank's involvement. The next stage in the reform
process must focus upon improving the cost competitiveness of the subsector
and upon introducing sector-wide improvements in research, trainlng and
distribution. Recause the private sector Plants are using modern dry
process technologY and are still building uD to full production,
improvements ln subsectoral efficiency must he secured through modernizing
and rehabilitating SCrP's older and more obsolete plants, and through the
development and implementation of a Corporate Strategy designed to improve
the Corporation's overall performance. The Corporate Strategy exercise
will raise difficult technological and political issues, particularly
concerning plant size and location, closures, and labor rationalization.
GOP's efforts to deal with these complex issues and to maintain the
momentum of reform will be considerablv facilitated bv the Rank's support
for the project.  Parallel to this project, Rank funds, in the form of
lines of credit to development banks, are available for the further



- 4 -
development of private sector cement plants. Recently, a ttStS million loan
for a private cement plant was approved under an Industrial Investment
Credit Project.
AeActions:
11.       Agreement has been reached with SCCP that it will:  (a) prepare
and review with the Rank and (.OP, Prior to implementation, a Corporate
strategy and a Management Information System, with the signing of a
contract between SCCP and consultants hired to assist the Corporation as a
condition of effectiveness; (b) not undertake any new investments in the
project entities before investment erlteria have been determined under the
Corporate Strategy exercise; (c) take steos to d-relop the Cement Research
institute, initially under the auspices of SCCP, hut with provision for
converting it eventually into an autonomous organization supported by fees
Paid by cement producers and consumers, (d) operate all project facilities
in accordance with environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank;
(e) onlend T1S4R7.9 million to the six subsidiarv cement companies on terms
and condttions satisfactory to the Bank, with executiot of the sub-loan
agreements between SC"P and the subsidiaries, a well as execution of the
subsidiary loan agreement between GOP and SCCP, as conditions of
effectiveness; and (f) maintain and cause to be maintained a debt-equity
ratio of not more than 67:33 at all times, a current ratio of at least 1.3
and debt service coverage of 1.5.
12.       Agreement has been reached with GOP that it will:  (a) maintain a
Policy environment conducive to the growth of an efficient and
Internationallv competitive cement industry; and (b) support and
participate in the formulation and implementation of SCCP's Corporate
etrategv.
Justification
VI.       Ouantifiable economic benefits under the project include an
increase in cement output at significantlv lower unit cost, and additional
emplovment In ecuipment-producing industries.  Estimated ERR for the
rehabilitation and expansion of the Wah plant is 28%, and 56% for minor
rehabilitation of five SCCP wet-orocess olants.  T)evelopment of a
comprehensive Corporate Strategy for SCCP will permit more efficient
resource allocation and investment decisions in the future.  Improved
longer-term planning by SCCP will also create a firmer basis for investment
decisions by the private sector. Establishment of research facillties and
sector-wide training will also lead to improved productivitv and market and
oroduct development.
Prolect Risks
14.       The principal risk for the projecv is delay in the execution of
the Wah component, stemming from X saible problems in coordinating
equipment purchases (from forelgn and local sources) with the civil works.
Rowever, the SCCP proiect team comprises competent staff with recent
experience in pro.iect design and execution, and it will receive assistance



- s -
in critlcal phases of prolect Implementation from an experienced
engineering consultant. rurthermore, delavs in equlpment supply are
unlikely becaube equipment supoliers serving the sector are underbooked.
Tn the longer run, there is a risk that O'OP will not permit SCCP to
implement parts of its Corporate Strategy because of political difficulties
of closing Plants and reducing the labor force in narticular areas.
However, one of the benefits of corporate qtrategv exercise is that it will
both define an ootimal strategv for longer-term development 6f the
Corporation and also clearly indicate the costs of not pursuing this
strateev for political or other reasons. Unscheduled power cuts constitute
another risk that mav affect the nro.ect. Power generation is expected to
remain a Problem and SCCP is planni-g to alleviate the problem by
lnstalling 5nn RVA diesel generators in the two largest plants covered
under the prolect.
Recommendations
19.       I am satisfied that the pronosed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
'irectors approve the pronosed loan.
