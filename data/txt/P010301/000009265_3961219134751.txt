CEMENT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2884-PAK)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Cement
Industry Modernization Project in Pakistan, for whichl Loan Number 2884-PAK in the
amount of US$96.0 million equivalent was approved on November 1 7, 1987, and made
effective on June 23, 1988. As a result of the unexpected weakening of the US dollar it
became obvious early 1990 that the loan amount would be insufficienit lor the needs of
the Project. Because of the devastating effect of the Ciulf war on1 I'akistai's foreign
exchange eamings the Bank agreed to consider providing a supplemental loan if the
borrower were unable to find other sources of financing. On November 7. 1990 the
borrower indicated that he was unable to find alternate financing and applied to the Bank
for a supplemental loan. A Supplemental Loan (ILn. 2884-PAK) in the amount of
US$56.4 million was approved by the Board on May 30. 1991. Because of delay by the
borrower in meeting a covenant for loan effectiveness, i.e. raising the sales price of SCCP
cement by US$2 per ton, the supplemental loan did not become effective until
January 15, 1992.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1995, compared with the originally
planned closing date of June 30, 1992 for Loan 2884-PAK and June 30, 1994 for Loan
2884-PAK. In June 1994, the Bank and the borrower agreed to extend loan closing date
to June 30, 1995. Final disbursement took place July 6. 1995.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Mogens Fog, IENIM with the financial
parts provided by Mr. Hassan Qureshi, Project Advisor. RMP, Islamabad. and reviewed
by Mr. Joseph Pernia, Acting Chief, SAIPF, and Mr. Abid Hasan, Acting Project
Adviser, SA1DR. The borrower through SCCP, the implementing agellcy, provided his
contribution that is shown as Appendix 2 to this ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final completion
mission, November 2-13, 1995. It is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, Loan and
Project Agreements, supervision reports, and the Project Completion Reports submitted
by the borrower and implementing enterprises, and on material in the project file. SCCP
provided views and data on the project and its implementatioln.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
CEMENT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2884-PAK)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.          The Bank's involvement with the cement sub-sector in Pakistan began in
1982 with the drafting of a Cement Sub-sector Report. The report indicated that the
cement industry was unable to meet the country's demand and that the existing policy
environment did not provide incentives for the private sector to invest. In 1985 the Bank
financed the preparation of a feasibility report through IDA Credit 1256-PAK and
following extensive discussions with GOP on policy issues the Project was appraised late
1986. Loan 2884-PAK in the amount of US$96 million was approved by the board
November 1987. Because of the subsequent weakening of the US dollar the loan amount
was found insufficient to meet Project requirements and the borrower applied for a
supplemental loan from the Bank after failing to find other sources for financing.
Because of the Gulf War's negative effect on Pakistan foreign exchange earnings, the
Bank agreed and approved a Supplemental Loan (Loan 2884-1) in May 1991 in the
amount of US$56.4 million, making the total loan amount US$152.4 million.
Project Objectives
2.          The overall objective of the Project was the rational development of the
Pakistan cement industry through the establishment of a proper policy environment. At
the time of appraisal, after extensive conversations with government officials, Bank staff
had concluded that the government was not ready to consider privatizing SCCP and its
fourteen units, comprising 85% of sector capacity. The four private sector cement
companies which had commenced operation quite recently were small with sub-scale



- iii -
production units, and their management had limited cement industry experience and it
was determined that these private sector cement companies would not serve as proper
vehicles for restructuring of the sub-sector. The Bank therefore decided to assist in
restructuring SCCP, partly in an attempt to make it a better candidate for future
privatization and partly because the larger size of SCCP would produce a larger impact
on the entire sub-sector. The five project components were designed as examples of
project design and appraisal, utilization of modern manufacturing technology and
efficient use of modern methods for development of human resources.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.          The overall sector objectives were achieved. Through a number of policy
measures, GOP liberalized the industry and in March, 1991. began privatizing SCCP's
operating units. Supply has now caught up witlh demand (para. 6). Most of the former
public sector plants have been privatized and are now operating in a very competitive
environment and most of Pakistan's cement plant are now based on modern technology.
The privatization of SCCP's operating units was carried out without participation of
SCCP and WCC staff, and staff morale suffered. This affected negatively project
implementation (para. 3). Three of the five project components were suspended because
the privatization made SCCP an unsuitable vehicle for those sub-projects (paras. 10, II
and 12). A fourth component, BMR, was completed but in some cases after ownership of
those operating units had shifted to the private sector (para. 9). The fifth component,
WCC, comprised the building of a modern one million tpy production line adjacent to the
old Wah cement plant, and this component consumed 90% of the total loan amount.
Implementation of WCC was unsatisfactory. The plant was commissioned 35 months
behind projections and the WCC capital cost increased 63.6% over what was projected in
the SAR. The financial and economic rates of return are far below SAR projections and
WCC is projected to operate at a loss at least over the medium term.
Project Sustainability
4.           Because of the effects of privatization on four of the five project
components comments on sustainability will be limited to the WCC component. The
WCC plant has been completed and will operate as per design parameters. All physical
objectives for the plant have been met, however, mainly because of the cost overrun, the
plant is not presently viable. Retention price of cement must increase by US$13.6 per ton
(22.7% of current market price) before the plant will break even. There are two main
reasons for this:
(i)    The significant cost overrun.



- Iv -
(ii)  Input prices have increased over SAR projections at a far higher
rate than the corresponding increases in cement retention prices.
WCC's fate seems to be tied to how fast WCC's competitors will
respond to inflationary pressures and raise retention prices.
Project Cost, Financing, Time Schedules
5.          Project cost was estimated at US$164 million at appraisal and actual costs
were US$223 million in spite of cancellation/suspension of disbursement on three of the
smaller project components. Capital cost for the WCC component was estimated at
US$123 million and the actual cost is US$200.7 million. The major factor in the cost
overrun is the delay in implementation; other factors contributing were depreciation of
the US dollar, a real increase in cement plant equipment because of stronger worldwide
demand and increases in tax and duty rates (para. 18). A number of factors caused the 35
month delay in implementation as explained in the maintext report (para. 27).
Bank and Borrower's Performance
6.          Bank performance was satisfactory in identification, preparation and
appraisal. However, in view of the very poor project implementation experienced,
questions can be raised, whether, once GOP decided in March, 1991, to privatize SCCP's
fourteen operating units, it might have been better if the Bank had withdrawn from the
project and left it to the private sector. Although Bank missions were quick to point out
that the exclusion of SCCP management and staff from the privatization process would
have dire consequences on staff morale in SCCP and would endanger project
implementation, measures to establish incentives for project staff to remain were too late
and inadequate. The less than satisfactory performance by the borrower was to a great
degree due to the constraints found in the public sector, such as cumbersome approval
levels and changes in management each time the government changed. The privatization
of SCCP's operating units, in itself a positive development, affected negatively project
implementation because of less than satisfactory personnel management. The various
factors are described in more detail below together with detailed analysis of lessons
learned.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
CEMENT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2884-PAK)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.   Background
1.          In response to a request from the Government of Pakistan (GOP) the Bank
carried out during 1982 studies in the industrial sector and a Cement Subsector Report
was issued early 1983. The report portrayed a heavily regulated industry based on sub-
sized plants of outdated technology. Following the 1972 nationalization all companies
were owned or controlled by GOP through the State Cement Corporation of Pakistan
(SCCP). The report showed that a deficit existed for cement and that the deficit was
projected to continue for the next four years. Following broad discussions with GOP the
Bank agreed to consider the possible financing of a project for modernization of the
cement industry with the understanding that GOP would take steps to liberalize the
industry. GOP announced partial decontrol in 1985 and provided financial incentives for
the private sector to invest in the cement subsector. Bank staff had concluded that GOP
was not yet ready to consider privatization of SCCP and its 14 units. Four private sector
cement companies had just entered into operation in 1985-87 but they would not serve as
a proper vehicle for the project because of sub-size production units and lack of cement
plant operating experience within their managements. The bank therefore agreed to assist
in the restructuring of SCCP, partly because it would make SCCP a more attractive
candidate for future privatization and partly because the sheer size of SCCP would result
in a greater impact on the sub-sector. Early 1986 an international cement consultant was
retained (financed under IDA Credit 1 256-PAK) to carry out a feasibility study for a
Bank project and a pre-appraisal mission visited Pakistan to discuss the scope of the
project. The project was appraised late 1986 and following a number of discussions
between the Bank and GOP Loan 2884-PAK in an amount of US$96 million was
approved by the board November 1987.
2.          The project was off to a slow start (date of loan effectiveness June 1988)
and by March 1990 there were strong indications that the Bank funds were insufficient



- 2 -
for the intended use (procurement of manufacturing equipment and payment for technical
assistance). The main reason for the short fall was weakening of the US Dollar against
the West European currencies (nearly all major contracts for supply of machinery and
equipment had been awarded to West European suppliers). Pakistan was at that time
incurring a serious loss of foreign exchange because of the Gulf War and the Bank agreed
under a special board resolution to provide a supplemental loan. In May 1991, the board
approved a supplemental loan in the amount of US$56.4 million corresponding to a total
loan amount of US$152.4 million for Loan 2884-PAK.
3.          In March 1991, GOP added all of SCCP's operating units (except Wah
Cement Company) to the list of public enterprises to be privatized . The privatization
process was carried out without any participation by SCCP and WCC personnel. As the
private sector took over SCCP's units (while at the same time initiating new cement plant
projects) attractive job opportunities for cement plant executives and operators opened up
and gradually all the important project staff left SCCP and WCC for the private sector.
The lack of continuity within SCCP and WCC personnel affected project implementation
strongly and contributed to the major delay in implementation. It also made it difficult to
draft and complete the ICR in a timely manner.
4.          The capacity of the cement industry has increased from 7.7 million tpy in
1987 to 10 million tpy in 1995, while private sector ownership has increased from 23%
to 88%. The industry is now mostly based on modern technology, supply has caught up
with demand and the industry has become truly competitive.
B.    Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
5.          The overall objective of the project was the rational development of the
Pakistan cement subsector through the establishment of a proper policy environment.
Since SCCP at the time of appraisal was the only significant player in the industry SCCP
was chosen as the vehicle for the project. The individual project components were to
serve as models for applying modem technology and human resource development to
SCCP and the cement industry as a whole.
C.   Achievement of Objectives
6.          Macroeconomics and Sector Policies. Following inception of the project
the government embarked on a program of gradual liberalization of the cement subsector,
and in 1985/86 the government removed all remaining controls. Price controls, freight
equalization and licensing were eliminated and the private sector responded by making
major investments in the subsector. In addition the government, after initially deciding to
limit its stake in the industry to SCCP's existing capacity, decided in 1991 to actually



- 3 -
eliminate its stake in the industry by offering SCCP's operating units for sale. The last
government controlled cement unit, WCC, was sold by auction in January 1996, and the
industry is now highly competitive and able to meet the country's demand for cement.
About 60% of industry capacity is now based on energy efficient dry process technology
compared to 40% in 1987 so it can be stated that the general objectives of the project
have been attained.
7.          Attainment of Physical Objectives of the Sub-projects. The ICR
Mission's Aide Memoir together with the attached Operating Plan, dated November 13,
1995, attached as Annex 1, gives details and comments on the five project components.
8.          Wah Cement Company Component (WCC). This component,
accounting for 90% of the total project cost, comprises a modern one million tpy cement
production line at the old Wah cement plant to replace the old, sub-sized production
lines. The new production line would be based on the latest technology and would serve
as a model for the Pakistan cement industry. The plant has been completed and was
commissioned in November 1994. During commissioning a number of deficiencies were
found in the machinery and the main equipment supplier had to modify the equipment.
Following privatization of Wah there has been very little communication between the
Bank and Wah, however, it is understood, that following modifications to the equipment
carried out by the supplier, the plant will operate at the production rates and energy and
pollution control efficiencies projected in the SAR. However, some of the production
rates and energy efficiencies guaranteed in the supply contracts may not be attained such
as fuel efficiency in cement kiln (690 kcal/kg clinker guaranteed and 800 kcal/kg clinker
attained). Similarly it has been reported that the gypsum crusher and the cement mill
system appear to be unable to reach the guaranteed production rates. (see para. 15).
9.          Balancing, Modernization and Rehabilitation (BMR) Component.
This component funded small to medium scale rehabilitation programs for four of the
former SCCP cement plants. Originally BMR included five SCCP units, but
disbursement for the Javedan unit did not take place because of lack of compliance with
the financial covenants. Subprojects under the BMR program were designed to enhance
environmental control and operating efficiency of the cement plants included. In 1992,
during the initial privatization phase, bids were received on all four units and three of
them (Gharibwal, Maple Leaf and Zeal Pak) were acquired by private sector companies.
The fourth company , Mustehkam, is still operated by SCCP, while the courts decide the
outcome of the bidding process. Disbursement of Bank funds for these four units was
US$ 20 million against projected US$ 22 million but following privatization no detailed
information on these three sub-projects has been made available except confirmation that
the projects were completed with the expected benefits. The subprojects for the
Mustehkam plant comprised the installation of two filters for cleaning kiln gases and a
packing machine for improving packer efficiency and reducing fugitive dust emissions.



- 4 -
10.         Corporate Strategy and Management Information System (CS&MIS),
Human Resource Development (HRD) and Cement Research Institute (CRI)
Components. These three institution building components addressed existing needs at
the time of appraisal. The government's decision in 1991 to privatize SCCP's operating
units made SCCP an unviable vehicle for implementation of these project components
and further disbursement on these three project components was essentially suspended.
Attempts were made to find a role for HRD and CRI in the new environment (paras 12
and 13) because both institutions would serve very useful functions in today's
environment.
11.         CS&MIS Component. The government's decision to withdraw from the
cement industry and the resultant sell-off of SCCP's operating units voided the purpose
of the CS&MIS component. SCCP would obviously be left with a much reduced role
and most likely with a limited life, so further disbursement on that component was
suspended. At that time US$Imillion out of the allocated US$3 .4 million had been
disbursed.
12.         HRD Component. Under the HRD component two centers for training
of cement plant operators in operating modern computer controlled cement plants had
been anticipated. Following the privatization of SCCP's units attempts were made to
make the private sector cement manufacturing companies interested in a joint operation
of one or two such centers. The private sector was at that time actively investing in new
greenfields cement plants and a great demand for properly trained cement plant operators
had developed. However, all attempts to promote such a joint effort failed.
Disbursement of Bank funds for this component was limited to US$1.3 million for
cement plant operator training courses which already had been contracted (this compares
to the US$3.6 million allocated for this component)
13.         CRI Component. This component would fund the establishment of a
laboratory and testing center for doing research and testing on cement and concrete based
building materials. Following privatization SCCP staff submitted proposals for
completing the center as planned and operating it on a commercial basis, however, none
of the proposals could demonstrate commercial viability. Subsequently it was attempted
to make the government interested in having the center become part of the national
institute for standards with responsibility for testing/enforcing/establishing cement
standards. Unfortunately the concerned government agencies failed to respond and no
Bank funds were disbursed on this component.
14.         Financial Objectives. Because of the effects of privatization on four out
of the five project components, as outlined above in paras 9-13, comparison of actual
projections with SAR projections is only meaningful for the WCC component. The total
project capital costs are shown in Table 8A and it shows a cost overrun of 36%. The
WCC component comprising 90% of total project cost has a significant cost overrun
while the four other components are below SAR projections.



-5-
15.         WCC Component. In spite of the initial equipment operations problems
the plant will operate with the production rates and the energy efficiency indicated in the
SAR. This assumption has been reflected in the Operating Plan and in Table 6. The
financial objectives expressed in the SAR as IRR and ERR (I 9.8% and 27.8%
respectively ) have not be achieved. Projections for WCC show an IRR of 8.6% and an
ERR of 17.8%. The reason for the lower rates of return is the capital cost overrun of
63.5% (para 16), the lower capacity utilization in the first year of operation and that
manufacturing costs have increased 59% over SAR (para 19) while cement retention
prices have increased only 9% over SAR (para 20). Financial projections show WCC
will operate at a loss and continuously increase borrowing. Delays and subsequent failure
of parts of the main equipment to reach guaranteed production rates and energy
efficiencies have hurt the plant's financial performance severely and SCCP has only
limited recourse against the supplier because the supply contract, in conformity with
Bank guidelines, does not contain provisions for consequential damages.
16.         WCC Project Costs. Table 8A-1 shows the WCC project cost of US$201
million corresponding, to a cost overrun of US$78 million over the 1987 SAR projection
of US$123 million (63.5% overrun). Based on commonly used world average figures for
cement plant capital costs (and taking into account that Pakistan had to import most of the
machinery and equipment) the cost of one million tpy cement plant of Wah quality and
conservative design with ample back-up capacities would today be estimated at some
US$160 million.
17.         Distribution of cost overrun. After applying physical and price
contingencies on a proportional basis to the first seven categories in the SAR projections
for WCC capital costs (Table 8A1) it is calculated that the US$78 million overrun is
distributed as follows:
US$ million
"buildings"                                  1.9
"machinery, equipment and spares"           32.1
"freight, insurance etc"                     1.5
"installation"                               1.3
"taxes and duties"                          15.6
"working capital"                            2.1
"interest during construction"              24.7
"start-up, engineering and technical assistance"    (1.2)
Total                                   US$78.0 million
18.         Major factors in the cost overrun are:
(a)   Depreciation of US Dollar - a major factor in the cost overrun on
machinery and equipment was the depreciation of the US Dollar against the



- 6 -
European currencies since nearly all of the contracts for "machinery, equipment
and spares" called for payment in German DM or Danish Krone. At the time of
appraisal (June 1987) the rate of exchange was US$1 to DM 1.83. During the
main disbursement period the rate of exchange was closer to US$1 to DM1.50-
1.55, a depreciation of some 17%. This would contribute US$11.8 million
toward the overrun on "machinery, equipment and spares"
(b)   Real price increase in cement plant equipment - during the same period
(because of increased world wide demand) a 20% real increase in the price of
cement plant equipment occurred. The contribution by this factor to the overrun
on "machinery, equipment and spares" is computed as US$13.9 million.
(c)   Higher than estimated international inflation rates - in 1991, when the
supplemental loan was approved, it was recorded that actual international inflation
rates exceeded SAR projections. The effect of this factor over the total
implementation period has not been computed.
(d)   Delay in implementation (35 months) - Apart from the obvious effect on
interest during construction and cost increases due to inflation this factor also
exposed the project to new tax and duty rates instituted subsequent to the initially
projected period.
(e)   Increase in building costs - the plant was designed according to the
criteria laid down in the SAR without any change in scope. However, soil
conditions and design criteria for low maintenance cost caused the new
production line to be located slightly further away from the old Wah production
lines than anticipated, and this may have contributed to the 2.5% overrun on
"buildings".
19.         WCC Cost of Production. As stated above the physical performance of
the plant projected in the Operating Plan (production rates, energy efficiencies etc.)
matches SAR projections, however, unit manufacturing costs have risen far sharper than
increases realized in cement retention price (59% versus 8.6%). The projected total
manufacturing cost is US$65.4 per ton (at 100% capacity utilization) versus US$41.25
per ton in the SAR. Of the US$24.2 per ton increase in manufacturing costs US$9.2 per
ton comes from increase in variable costs and US$14.9 per ton from fixed costs.
(a)   Variable costs - the Wah plant is projected to operate at the efficiencies
and capacity utilization assumed in the SAR, yet the financial projections
indicate an increase of 42.4% in unit variable cost, reflecting the effect of
inflation. Major contributors to the increase are packing materials (unit cost
increase 38.8%), power (unit cost increase 95%) and consumable and
maintenance (unit cost increase 79%). The ICR mission has been unable to get



- 7 -
WCC cooperation for a detailed analysis of input costs, but the Mission believes
the stated costs to be reasonably correct.
(b)   Fixed costs - projected fixed cost increased by US$14.9 per ton
(77%) over SAR projections. The 63.5% overrun in capital costs caused
depreciation costs to increase by some US$7.7 per ton and the US$34 million
(48.6%) increase in WCC's Bank borrowing caused WCC's unit interest cost to
increase by US$5 per ton. The sum of these two items is US$12.7 per ton. The
ICR mission was unable to obtain further cooperation from WCC in order to
analyze the remaining US$1.5 per ton fixed costs cost increase, but the Mission
believes the stated costs to be reasonably correct.
20.         Cement Retention Price. The SAR assumed a retention price FOB plant
of US$55.3 per ton while the Operating Plan (OP) projections are based on US$60 per
ton, an increase of 8.6%, far short of the 59% increase in cost of production (para 19).
Analysis indicates that a retention price of US$73.6 per ton (compared to current market
price of US$60 per ton) would be needed for the plant to break even (based on the rate of
interest charged on the Bank loan) and US$88.6 per ton if WCC had to pay interest
presently charged by Pakistan banks. It is difficult to project future cement retention
prices. Because of the unrest in the Southern region demand there for cement is relatively
weak and the region suffers from a definite excess of supply . In the Northern region
there is presently a slight excess of demand, however, five new cement plant projects
presently under implementation will come on stream between now and 1998 and 4-5
million tpy of new capacity will be added to the existing capacity of 10 million tpy, and
it is projected that by year 2000, supply will exceed demand by 3.5 million tpy. Cement
demand in Pakistan has been growing at an annual rate of 6-7% and the market will find
it difficult to absorb that much new capacity. Most likely retention prices will become
depressed in 1998. Because of inflationary pressures some cement companies announced
price increases in November 1995 but the market situation is uncertain and it remains to
be seen whether WCC will be able to break even/make profit.
21.         Financial Effects of Change of Ownership. In connection with the
January 10, 1996 privatization of WCC the employees exercised their right to acquire the
company by matching the highest bid offered during the auction. They paid US$0.55 per
share for 80% of the existing shares. However, the investment is equivalent to US$200
million at current rate of exchange of about Rs 35 per US$1. While, the acquisition cost
of the plant is more or less the same as the capital cost of the plant. the advantage is that
the liability is in Pak Rupees entirely at an interest rate of only 15 percent. New projects
now being set up carry an average interest rate of about 20 percent due to foreign
currency risk coverage being no longer available from the State Bank of Pakistan at a
subsidized rate. Thus Wah Cement will have a competitive edge over the new plants,
while, its cost of production would be lower compared with older plants due to its
economy of scale. If the economy of Pakistan improves to the normal level, the project
may be earning profits within a few years.



22.         Social Objectives. The project was prepared in 1986/87 at which time
poverty alleviation and gender concerns were not explicitly addressed. The cement plants
participating in the project provide housing, schools and clinics for the employees.
23.         Environment. The pollution control board has specified a maximum
emission level of 150 mg/NM3 of particulates for source emissions in populated areas
and 250 mg/NM3 in non protected areas. The WCC and Mustehkam pollution control
equipment is designed for less than 100 mg/NM3 of particulates and preliminary tests
indicate that the equipment will meet the specifications. The design of the plant also
made provisions for proper reduction of fugitive dust emissions. The plant is equipped
with continuous monitoring equipment at the major sources of particulate emission.
Successive supervision missions emphasized the importance of creating an environmental
unit to report directly to the managing director, but WCC has failed in following up on
the recommendations.
24.         Institutional Development. As mentioned in paras 11, 12 and 13 above
three of the project components served to build institutional capabilities in the areas of
corporate planning, MIS, training of cement plant operators, establishment and
enforcement of cement quality standards and research into concrete based building
materials. Following privatization of SCCP's operating units it became obvious that
SCCP could not serve as a proper vehicle for implementation of the three project
components and regrettably institution building in the mentioned areas did not take place.
D.    Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
25.         Project Implementation Team, Organization. SCCP was assigned
responsibility for project implementation, however it was required under the loan
agreement (as a condition of loan effectiveness) to contract for the assistance of an
experienced international consultant. SCCP formed a project implementation team from
among its cement plant engineers who had participated in the design and start up of
SCCP plants. The team cooperated closely during the design phase with the consultant
who resided in Switzerland. During the construction phase the consultant sent one
engineer to the site to assist in site management and critical path analysis .
26.         Project Implementation Time. The SAR had projected project
completion by December 1991. Wah cement plant was commissioned in November
1994, corresponding to a delay of 35 months. The below analysis of delays focuses
entirely on the WCC component. A delay in implementation of some 12-18 months
would not have been unusual for such a large and complicated project, but the 35 months
delay must certainly be considered excessive by any standard. The major causes of the
delays are listed below.



-9-
27.         Major Factors Contributing to Implementation Delay.
(i)    Delay in finalization of consultant contract (para 25 above) (6 months'
delay).
(ii)   Failure of GOP/SCCP to meet covenant for supplemental loan (para 27(v))
(9 months delay).
(iii)  Temporary shortage of funds prior to effectiveness of supplemental loan.
(iv)   Effects of the SCCP privatization (para 3).
(v)   Cumbersome channels for approval. The route of approval of major
procurement decisions (award of contract typically) went from the SCCP
project team to the Chairman, SCCP to Ministry of Production and in
certain cases to higher levels of government. In most cases approval was
readily forthcoming but in a couple of cases delays were incurred at higher
level (see sub-para (vi) below). The most serious case of delay occurred
following the approval of the Supplementary Loan late 1991. The
Agreement Amending Loan Agreement and Project Agreement signed on
July 8, 1991, specified, as a condition of effectiveness, that the Borrower
and SCCP implement an increase of the equivalent of at least US$2 per
ton in the price of cement produced by SCCP subsidiaries. The price
increase was implemented nine months later and this delayed contracting
for package 6, "Electrical Equipment". The delay in procurement of
package 6 delayed commissioning of Wah at least nine months. Upto two
months of delay occurred within the Bank in connection with procurement
because of the hectic of travel schedule of the task manager and
difficulties in arranging for substitute task managers.
(vi)   Contentious bidding. For two of the major equipment packages award of
contract was delayed because of protest from unsuccessful bidders. Local
agents for the international bidders lodged complaints with higher level
government officials and clarification of the Bank procurement process to
all these parties delayed the award of these contracts.
(vii)  Frequent change of SCCP chairman and SCCP managers. During
implementation of the project the SCCP chairman was replaced five times
and in each case momentum was lost and delays occurred.
(viii)  Weak site management. The WCC site management team did not make
good use of the services of the site management specialist provided by the
consultant.

E.    Project Sustainability
28.         Paras 9-13 above have commented on the four project components which
were affected by the privatization of SCCP and for which disbursement was partially or
fully suspended. Comments on the WCC component are listed below.
WCC Component - the plant is based on modern technology and is designed for
low cost maintenance. The very long commissioning time has provided WCC
management and staff with adequate training and the plant should be very
competitive in respect of variable manufacturing costs. Plant location, in the
Northern region of Pakistan with relatively high economic growth, is favorable,
although most of new plants under implementation (para 20) are located in the
same geographical area. As mentioned in para 15 above WCC with its high capital
costs is operating at a loss at the present retention price. Sensitivity analysis (para
20) indicates that retention prices must be raised by US$13.6 per ton (22.7%) in
order for WCC to break even. WCC's competitors certainly are feeling
inflationary pressures and the fate of WCC depends on how quickly the
competitors will raise retention prices. The sudden jump in supply expected in
1997-98 (para 20) can be expected to depress retention prices from 1998 onwards.
It is a judgment call whether WCC financially will become a sustainable
operation.
F. Bank Performance
29.         In the areas of identification, preparation, and appraisal Bank performance
was satisfactory. The Bank correctly diagnosed during the identification stage the factors
which prevented the industry from functioning efficiently and intense negotiations were
carried out with the government regarding the policy environment. The decision to assist
in the restructuring of SCCP, a public sector company, must be accepted as being correct
in its time frame, since all indications at that time were that GOP would not consider
privatization of SCCP. The appraisal went into great details in the technical, financial,
economic, training and environmental areas. Bank personnel correctly sensed the need
for outside assistance in project implementation and obtained agreement for the retention
of experienced outside consultants. However, in retrospect, appraisal estimate of project
implementation period was ambitious and assessment of potential risks inadequate. Bank
personnel also acted quickly in arranging for a supplemental loan, when the weakening of
the US dollar caused the first designated loan amount to become insufficient. In view of
the outcome of the project (and in particular the outcome of the Wah sub-project) Bank
performance during supervision, and in proceeding with the supplemental loan without a
more far reaching assessment of potential risk factors.

30.           Tle Bank mouLnted eight supervision missions (a eragce intcrlal 1 1.4
months) usually comprising two persons. task manager/finiancial analyst and a cemilenit
industry specialist. Project implemenitationi andi outstant_dingL issues xere discussed in

units progressed (para 3) and job opportunities opened up in the private sector. staff
from SCCP and the project teams began to leave and the communication between the
project teams and the Bank deteriorated. For the last couple of years no project progress
reports were issued. Similarly the teams failed to unldertake the agreed training program
for plant operators which was to be funded by the Bank under the project. T'he teams also
failed to create an environmental unit within the Wah organizatioll.
H. Assessment of Outcome
32.          The overall Project objective was met in the sense that the cement industry
in Pakistan now is based on modern and energy efficient plants which operate in a highly
competitive environment. Outcome of the individual project compolnents was mixed.
Because of the privatization of SCCP's operating units three of the five project
components were suspended (para 11-13 and 24). The sub-projects under the BMR
project component were completed satisfactorily. in some cases by the new private sector
owners, with the projected improvements in operating efficiency and environmental
control in the various cemenit plants. The major project component, Wah cement plant.
was built as designed as an example of up-to-date techniology, however, because of delays
in implementation, major overrun in capital costs (para 18) and the fact that WCC at
present is not financially viable, it is difficult to present Wah as an example to be
emulated.
33.          In an institutional sense project staff at SCCP and WCC (past and present)
learned the mechanics of project preparation and implemiienitationi and in the future the
private sector cement industry will benefit from their experienice. In the same way the
strict environmental standards applied during pro ject preparation and implementation
have assisted to set standards for the cement industrv as a whole. All new cement plant
projects in Pakistan have adopted emission control standards in line with those of the
Project.
I. Future Operations
34.          Following the liberalization of industrial policy and the positive response
by the private sector it is not expected that the Bank wvill launchl new projects in the
cement industry.
J. Lessons Learned
35.          The Project has demonstrated the inhlerenit r isks in financinig of public
sector projects as commented in sub-paras. (a)i. (a)ii anid (a)iii.



- 13 -
(a)i   Since significant implementation delays are more likely to be incurred for
projects in the public sector more weight should have been giveni in the SAR to the
Bank's disbursement profile for the country (approximately 7 years). The SAR estimate
for project completion time (3 years) was based on world wide experienice witlh
greenfields cement plant projects, and assumed that the cemenit expert retained would
assure satisfactory implementation.
(a)ii  Continuity within the implementing agenicy is extremely important.
Project preparation was thorough and the project was well designied. However the
frequent changes in SCCP chairman and management, and the gradual departure of staff
from SCCP and WCC project teams weakened implemenitation and follow-up by
designated staff (para 3). The frequent changes also weakened overall project
management which should have assured proper cooperation between SCCP project team
and WCC site management team (para 31).
(a)iii  Cumbersome channels for reporting and approval and lack of delegation
cause significant delays in implementation (para 27).
(b)   Procurement was very time consuming. The standardization of bidding
documents, which has since been implemented in the Banik. is a major step towards
streamlining the procurement process and it would have reduced implemiienitation time of
the Project considerably. Many of the SCCP staff, wlhicl were involved in the
procurement process. have adopted Bank procedures for procuremenit after joining the
private sector.
(c)   The sharp focus and detailed analysis on the cement sub-sector during
project preparation most likely induced GOP to decide on1 an early privatization of the
cement sub-sector.

CEMENT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT (LOAN 2884-1)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION IREPORT MISSION
AIDE MEMOIRE
November 1995
1.           A ImlissionI comilprisiiig Mr. Mogens Fog and Mr. A.lH. Qureshi visited Pakistan
November 3-13, 1995 to prepare the Implemenitationi Comiipletioni Repor-t (ICR) for the above
project. Loan 2884-1 was closed on Julle 30, 1995 and the CR ImliSsiOI hiad beeni planned for
July 1995. Mr. Fog and Qureshli visited Pakistan July 1-11 . 1(95s to carry out an ICR mission
however SCCP was not suLfficiently prepared for IC'R preparation hecause of the problems
encountered in commissionling the Wah plant anid consequnCItlV the ICR ImlissioIn was postponed
to this date. Mr. Hikmat Nasr joined the Mission during tihc meetingvs in Islaniabad. The
Mission wishes to express its gratitude to the Ministry ofl Industries anid Production. Economic
and Statistics Division of the NMinistrv of Finance, tihe State Ce'menit C'orporation of Pakistan
(SCCP), and Wah Cement Company Ltd. for the courltesies extended to the Mission. The
following expresses the Mission's findinigs and reconiniendations, which are subject to review
and approval of Bank maniagemiient.
2.            Background. ILoan 2884-PAK in thle aLu110n1t ol'f I S$96 millionv was approved
by the board in November 1987. and became effecti\e .lunc 19)88. Iarly 1 991 . wien the US
Dollar had weakened, it became evident that the loan ao10unt ol'l 1SS(9 mlillioll would not
cover the intenided Bank finanicino and a supplemICental loan in thle aLmounlt o U!S$56.4 million
was approved by the board in May 1991 makin.g the total loan am11ouLn t i$ 1W52.4 millioni.
3.           Project Objectives. The main objective of'thie project as to encourage and
assist GOP in liberalizing the cemiienit industry. Years of price conitiols hiad tenided to discourage
investimienits in the cem1ent industry anid for long periocis ol' timae tlhe coliVtry sulffered firomii
cemen1t shortage wlhile the cemiien1t induIstry WaS operal inlc sub1-Si/Cd. Olut-dated t(elmtCology
cement plants. The project was designed to encouraoe and( dem1olIstIate: use oflmodern
ianLIfacturiiig techniology and pollutioni control. plannilng 1or olitimlizationi of'plant size and
location, development of humnan resources and trainilng and the establisiment ol' t'acilities lor
the development of new types of'cemilent. Since SCCP capacitN comiprised 77% ot'total industry
capacity it was decided to use S('CC'1 as a vehicle for n-odlcrnIizatioll ol'thle industry while
preparing the company for restructuriL  .

4.          Project Description. The project comprised the following five components:
(i)    Wah component - installation of a one million tpy modem dry process
production line in the Wah plant to replace five old wet process kilns. The design and
lay-out of the new plant maximized easy access to all equipment for efficient, low cost
maintenance. Process equipment with high fuel and power efficiency was specified;
(ii)   BMR component (Balancing, Modernization and Rehabilitation) - medium-
scale upgrading of five other SCCP plants for improvement of energy efficiency and
pollution abatement;
(iii)   Corporate Strategy and Management Information Systems (MIS) -
introduction of strategic planning and modem management practices to SCCP to pave
the way for restructuring and possibly privatization;
(iv)   Human Resource Development - establishment of modem training centers for
cement plant operators;
(v)   Cement Research Institute (CRI) - facilities for testing of cement and building
materials and development of additional types of cement.
5.          Privatization of SCCP holdings. In March 1991 GOP included SCCP's units
(except the Wah plant) in the list of public enterprises to be privatized. The privatization
process was carried out in isolation of SCCP's management and personnel and as a result all
staff in SCCP and its units felt insecure. As the privatization progressed and at the same time a
number of new cement plants were being implemented key employees decided to leave SCCP
and take employment with the private sector. Later SCCP established incentives to keep key
plant personnel. The above factors affected project implementation.
6.          The dismemberment of SCCP resulting from privatization made it impossible to
justify further investment in the following project components:
(i)    Corporate Strategy and MIS - After discussions between GOP, SCCP and the
Bank, it was decided to suspend all further investment in this component since SCCP
would be greatly reduced in size or possibly eliminated.
(ii)   Human Resources Development - further investment in this component was
also suspended when it was realized that the private sector cement manufacturers were
unwilling to participate in training centers for cement plant operators.



- 28 -
(iii)   Cement Research Institute - further investments in this component were also
suspended when SCCP failed to obtain Government and industry support for a national
testing center for monitoring of cement quality.
Project Implementation
7.          Organization. From the inception project management was carried out by a
SCCP project team with experience in project and construction site management, process and
finance. In order to assure full integration of up-to-date technology the Bank and SCCP had
agreed that SCCP should retain the services of an experienced external consultant to assist in
engineering and site management, drafting tender documents, evaluating bids and assisting in
contract negotiations. The contract with the consultant was signed March 1988. As the project
progressed to the equipment erection stage Wah Cement Company (WCC) personnel were
deputed to the site and over time they gradually took over project and site management. During
implementation there was not sufficient use made of modern project monitoring techniques for
site management.
8.          Time Schedule. The SAR projected plant commissioning of Wah to take place
in the fourth quarter of 1991, and when the Supplementary Loan was approved in May 1991
delays had already been recorded. The Wah plant was actually commissioned November 1994
nearly three years later than originally projected. Among the major causes for delay are:
(i)    Delay in procurement of main process equipment (packages 2,3 and 4);
(ii)   Delay in the signing of the contract for package 6 (electrical motors and control
equipment) because of GOP's delay in meeting one of the conditions for the
supplementary loan (implementation of a US$2 per ton cement price increase);
(iii)  The effect of privatization of SCCP on project management, and
(iv)   Procurement process and problems in obtaining responsive bids.
The ICR will attempt to comment in more detail on this issue. Key Indicators for
Project Performance are shown in Annex 1.

10.         As seen above actual project costs exceeded significantly the cost projected in
the SAR. The major portion of the cost overrun was incurred in connection with the Wah
component as shown in para 11 below. Below are brief comments on the other project
components:
(a)   Corporate Strategy/MIS, HRD and ICR - because of the mid-stream
suspension of investment in these three components (para 6 above) the ICR will not
analyze in detail the differences between planned and actual costs for these components
nor attempt to calculate rates of return.
(b)   BMR - following appraisal SCCP decided (and the Bank agreed) to substitute
some of the originally proposed BMR sub-projects with more suitable sub-projects. All
sub-projects in one of the five plants under this component (Javedan Cement Company)
were canceled mid-stream (prior to disbursement) because of deterioration of the
company's financial condition. Three of the remaining four plants under the component
were privatized and no informnation is available on the local cost components of these
sub-projects. Consequently it is proposed that the ICR will not present detailed analysis
of differences between planned and actual costs for the individual BMR sub-projects
nor attempt to calculate rates of return.
11.         Wah component project cost. This component was completed on March 31,
1995 at a total cost expressed in Rupees of Rs.5.239 billion. Foreign exchange costs were
US$102 million, which converts to Rs.2.592 billion. The Rs.5.239 billion total project cost
represents an overrun of 147% over the SAR project cost expressed in Rupees. The foreign
exchange cost component of US$102 million represents a 35% overrun over the SAR foreign
exchange cost. SCCP and the mission are working on a more detailed analysis of the over runs



- 30 -
and Annex 3 (shown as a draft) shows details of the break down based on the information
provided so far. The major overruns (as expressed in US dollars) were incurred in:
(a)   IDC - main reason the delays in implementation.
(b)   Civil work - because of delay in implementation the construction contracts were
signed later than projected and the Rupee amount became higher because of inflation.
In addition there were further significant increases because of extraordinary increases
(much beyond inflation) in the price of rebars and cement. As a result construction
costs expressed in US dollar equivalent also are significantly higher than SAR
projections.
(c)   Tax and Duty - during implementation, GOP introduced new rates for tariffs,
surcharges and sales tax on imported equipment. These increases could not have been
foreseen during appraisal.
(d)   Currencies - Another factor which contributed to cost overruns is changes in
the exchange rate US$/European currencies. Most of the equipment suppliers quoted in
European currencies.
12.         Disbursement. As of October 31, 1995 disbursement against the project
amounted to US$124.47 million which is 29.7% above the SAR projections but well below the
US$152.4 projected at the time of approval of the Supplementary Loan. Prior to loan closing
phased cancellations of loan funds in an amount of USS$27 million had taken place.
Wah Operating Plan
13.         Wah Plant Performance. The kiln was commissioned November 1994 and on
January 31, 1995 the raw mill motor failed and the plant remained shut down for 68 days until a
temporary replacement motor was found. The kiln is still suffering from teething and design
problems and the main equipment supplier is in the process of modifying/upgrading the
equipment in order to meet warranties. The cement mill has failed to reach the guaranteed
production rate of 190 tph. Following a number of tests the supplier has agreed to undertake
major equipment modifications in order to meet warranties. The gypsum crusher is not meeting
warranties. After initial modifications it is only producing at 40% of rated output and the
supplier is looking into other options for increasing production rate. It appears that it will be
difficult for the crusher to reach the guaranteed production rate. Although guarantee test have
not yet been performed it appears that following planned modifications the kiln may reach the
guaranteed production rate of 3000 tpd within the next six months. The Mission discussed in
detail with Wah management realistic assumptions for future operating performance and the
formulation of an Operating Plan. Key Indicators for Operation and the basic assumptions for
formulation of the Operating Plan are shown in Annex 2.



- 31 -
14.         Cement Market and Cement Prices. The Mission received from SCCP data
on the cement market, supply/demand balance and present and projected cement sales prices.
In addition the Mission met with some of the private sector cement manufacturers. Since
privatization it has become much more difficult to get firm data on cement consumption as such
statistics are not published by the government. Projections of future supply are also difficult to
make because the present economic environment and the recent increases in tariffs and taxes
have made promoters much more cautious. However, the assumptions forming the basis for the
SCCP projections appear realistic and should be used in the Operating Plan.
15.         Mission's View-. According to Bank procedures (BP 13.55) the ICR Mission
should record in the Aide Memoir the views of the Bank, borrower. and implementing agencies
on project implementation and operation and the operational plan. Although the Mission has
not fully completed analysis of the collected data it records the following views.
16.         Project Implementation. On basis of the SAR projections kiln commissioning
was delayed by 35 months which is excessive. A number of factors contributed to this delay
and apart from a 4-6 months delay consumed in making the loan effective and in hiring the
engineering consultant and the nine months delay caused by the government (para 8) it becomes
impossible to allocate quantitatively the remaining delay on the individual factors. Some of the
factors are external such as delays resulting from the procurement process but others are
internal. In the Mission's opinion project management deteriorated as the privatization process
progressed. In addition there was inadequate coordination between the SCCP project team and
the WCC project people and too little use was made of modern monitoring techniques for site
management (para 7).
17.         Cost Overrun. Most of the cost overruns must be ascribed to delay in
implementation however there are some which are caused by external factors over which the
project team had no control such as for instance the higher tariff and tax rates imposed by the
government during the project implementation period. The Mission expects to be able to
present a more detailed analysis of cost overruns in the ICR (para 11).
18.         Plant Operation. At the end of the planned equipment modifications which
will be carried out during the next six months (para 13) the commissioning period will be nearly
18 months which is unusually long. It is disappointing that the plant equipment has required a
succession of modifications, particularly since some of the modifications relate to rather basic
process engineering. As part of the Project Agreement SCCP would contract well in advance of
plant start-up for training of plant operators, however, SCCP omitted to do so. At a later date
new WCC management initiated an operator training program in collaboration with well
qualified local experts which has permitted the plant operators to reach such a skill level that
they now handle the plant safely.
19.   Borrower's View. To be provided within two weeks.

20.   Next Steps. Mr. Qureshi will continue to work with SCCP to finalize the financial
analysis and complete the required chapters and tables for the ICR and Mr. Fog will continue
drafting of the ICR on his return to Washington. SCCP will prepare within two weeks the
Borrower's Evaluation Report as specified in BP 13.55.

Appendix 2:
CEMENT INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
LOAN AGREEMENT NO. 2884-PARK
BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION, ASSESSMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION
Project Background and Description
1.          The Pakistan Cement Industry Modernization Project was conceived in the
early eighties. The need for this project was felt after the World Bank conducted a study of
the Pakistani cement sector in 1982. The results of this study indicated that in order to
make the Pakistani cement sector competitive in the international market, major investments
in the areas of production, technology, human resource development, information processing
and management style needed to be made. The Cement Industry Modernization Project
(CIMP) was then planned keeping in view the finalized recommendations of the reputed
German Consultants, M/s Dyckerhoff techno-economic study for AC Wah Expansion and
BMR of 5 existing middle aged units -- the two key sub-projects. It was mutually agreed
between the Government of Pakistan (GOP) and the World Bank that funds were required in
order to successfully execute the project. The World Band offered to provide a US$96.0
million in order to meet the foreign exchange requirements whereas the local financing was
to be arranged from the commercial banks and the State Cement Corporation of Pakistan
(Pvt.) limited (SCCP).
2.          The World bank prepared its Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), dated 30th
September, 1987. A loan agreement No. 2884-PAK was signed between the GOP and the
IBRD on 23rd December, 1987 and it became effective in June 1988. Work on all the
components of the project began simultaneously following the Pakistan Government
approval accorded in October 1987. Out of the World Bank loan of US$96.0 million, the
major component accounted for AC Wah Expansion sub-project, for which funds amounting
to US$68.26 million were set apart as per the expenditure details provided in the aforesaid
SAR. The balance loan amount of about US$27.74 million was provided for the
implementation of the four other components. Later, however, on the basis of engineering
study carried out by M/s Holderbank, it was felt that the originally approved foreign
exchange funding by the World Bank might fall short, particularly on account of the
implementation requirements of the AC Wah Expansion Project and after signing of main
machinery packages 2, 3 and 4 on March 1990. In early 199 1, SCCP management and the
World Bank mutually agreed that the originally allocated foreign funds of US$96.0 million
ought to be enhanced to a level of US$152.4 million. Accordingly on July 8, 1991 loan
agreement No. 2884-PAK (Supplemental Loan) was approved by the World Bank. An
amount of US$15.14 million was left free which was designed to be later incorporated into



- 34 -
any component where the shortfalls could have occurred. The initial Loan No. 2884-0-PAK
was Tranche 1 and the Supplemental Loan No. 2884-PAK was Tranche 2.
The CIMP was split into the five following components:
1.          AC Wah Expansion Project. The AC Wah cement plant was the oldest
cement plant in Pakistan dating back to early 1920s. Initially, it was planned that major
BMR would be carried out at this plant. Various alternative and technical options at 2000-
2600-3000 TPD were weighed and contrasted for cost/benefit ratios. This project, over a
period of time, assumed the status of a greenfield project. In the CIMP, it was envisaged that
the five wet process kilns operating at the Wah Plant would be replaced by a preheater
precalciner process line with a kiln of 3000 tones per day capacity. The dry process of
manufacturing which had ruled the cement industry since early 1980s in the country was
adopted in view of being more energy efficient. The Wah plant was expected to increase the
production capacity of the plant by 500,000 tpy and also to reduce the unit cost of
production, permitting most viable and optimal economic operations.
(a)   It was estimated that out of the original loan amount of US$96.0 million, an
amount of US$68.26 million was to be spent on the AC Wah Expansion Project. In the
Supplemental Loan Agreement, the AC Wah component foreign funding was enhanced to
US$109.135 million. This amount was to be utilized to meet the foreign exchange
requirement of the project whereas the local currency requirements were to be met by the
SCCP. The actual foreign project completion cost is however, firmed up on the basis of
about US$102.0 million.
2.          Balancing Modernization & Rehabilitation Program. The second
component of the CIMP to be carried out in view of the SCCP units, namely Maple Leaf,
ZealPak, Mustehkam, Gharibwal and Javedan Cements. The main objective of this BMR
was to remove the bottlenecks in the production lines and also to cater for the environment
protection issues. The BMR projects for four of the units were identified in the feasibility
study conducted by M/s Dykerhoff whereas BMR for the fifth unit was identified by SCCP
itself.
(a)   In the Tranche 1, it was estimated that an amount of US$16.00 million would
be spent to finance the foreign currency expenditures of the BMR component. This figure
was enhanced to US$22.225 million in the Supplemental Loan Agreement.
3.          Corporate Strategy & Management Information. SCCP had the biggest
market share and therefore, in order to upgrade the Pakistani cement industry, it was
considered that SCCP should become a strong and solid based institution. It was therefore,
planned that a major study should be carried out by a well reputed consulting firm. The
objective of this study was to design, develop and implement a Corporate Strategy and
Management Information System for SCCP and all of its units. SCCP was to assist the



- 35 -
consultant in this job by formulating a team of its select employees who would work closely
with the consultants.
(a)   An amount of US$2.5 million was earmarked for meeting the foreign exchange
expenditure of the study, including purchase of computer hardware for MIS. The
Supplemental Loan Agreement made no changes in this figure.
4.          Human Resource Development. Another measure designied for the
institution building of SCCP was a Human Resource Development Program. The main
objective of this program was to appoint an internationally reputed consultant for this
purpose. The consultant were to review the existing training facilities at two of the SCCP's
units and prepare a plan for their upgrading and installation of most modern training
equipment e.g. a computer simulator. This study was also to formulate a well structured
Human Resources Policy for the corporation.
(a)   An amount of US$2.7 million was initially planned to be spent on this
component of the CIMP. The amount was enhanced to US$3.6 million in the Supplemental
Loan Agreement.
5.          Cement Research & Development Institute. The establishment of a modern
and properly equipped research institute was intended in this component. This institute was
initially planned to carry out applied research in cement and also to set national standards
and specifications for the Pakistani cement industry. Later on, it was planned that this
institute would carry out research on all building materials. Thle private sector was also
planned to be included in the funding and operations of this institute. At a later stage, the
Research Institute was to operate as an independent business entity.
(a)   US$2.9 million was planned to be spent on this component to meet the
foreign currency expenditure of the technical assistance and equipment purchasing for this
institute. No amount was separately specified for this component in the Supplemental Loan
Agreement.
Project Implementation and execution
1.          The Loan Agreement initially specified the Loan Closing Date as 30th June,
1992. However, when the Supplemental Loan Agreement was signed in July 1991, the
Closing Date was extended to 30th June, 1994. This extension was made in light of the fact
that the CIMP, particularly the Wash component, was behind schedule and not expected to be
completed in the originally stipulated period. Later, SCCP, through the GOP, requested the
World Bank to extend the Closing Date to 31st December, 1994. The World Bank extended
the Loan Closing Date to 30th October, 1995. The World Bank also gave an additional four
months, i.e. up to 31 st October, 1995, in which SCCP could make payments for goods
supplied and services performed before the Closing Date, i.e. 30th June, 1995. As the



- 36 -
amount of the Supplemental Loan was determined by keeping a considerable cushion, a lot of
the loan amount became surplus. SCCP, at various stages evaluated its requirements and
surrendered an aggregate of US$27.00 million as surplus funds spread over in three phases.
2.          The execution/implementation of each of the five components of the CIMP
are briefly discussed below:
1.          AC Wah Expansion Project. This component of the CIMP has had its fair
share of time delays and cost over-runs. The project ran into delays right from the very start
and these continued to accumulate with the passage of time. In the original estimates, given
by the SAR, the project was expected to be fully commissioned by December 1991. In
contrast, the plant was commissioned and the kiln was fired in November 1994. This shows
a delay of 35 months which is abnormal. The first delay, which was of about 6 months
occurred in the beginning when the consultants, i.e. M/s Holderbank, were being hired and
consequently, the loan did not become effective. Another major delay, approximately 9
months, happened when the Supplemental Loan Agreement was signed.
(a)   One of the conditions of the loan effectiveness was that the SCCP was to
increase its cement prices by US$2.0 per ton. The GOP could not take timely decision with
the result that the signing of contract for the electrical panels and motors was delayed. The
remaining delay of about 25 months cannot be justified. Whereas some delays are only
natural in a project of this magnitude, the abnormal delays in this case can also be attributed
in part to the project executing authority itself. Absence of modem project management
techniques to monitor the progress of the project had telling effects on its pace of completion.
This was despite the fact that an amount of US$3.781 million was allocated for performance
of functions by M/s Holderbank which included the responsibility for continued
monitoring/implementation plan for the project. There were also large supervisory and
engineering service inputs, in terms of cost, from the suppliers i.e. M/s F.L. Smidth and MWs
ABB Quite high in relation to the capitalized project cost, Rs.674. 179 million alone had to be
expanded on account of the provision of advisory, engineering, supervisory, erection services
etc.
(b)   The monitoring process left a lot of flaws. Undoubtedly a weak monitoring
role was played by the executing agency and by the numerous World Bank Supervision
Missions which also lacked the effective evaluation of the ongoing implementation schedule
at the project. The cautionary signals failed to get transmitted to the proposed quarters for
catching up with the time. This mismanagement and lack of appreciation for the cost
implications could also be due to the privatization policy of the GOP. The rapid expansions
at some existing cement plants and greenfield plants using identical technology to the Wah
plant, were being planned by the private sector. This, in turn, resulted in shift of principle
interest of the supplier i.e. M/s FLS towards other private sector commitments affecting also
the delivery schedule of AC Wah equipment. This also created a big job market for the
experienced technical personnel working at Wah. As the private sector is a much better pay



- 37 -
master, SCCP gave a 35% increase to all its technical personnel as a measure aimed at
retaining the technical staff.
(c)   In addition to the time delays, the AC Wah Expansion project also witnessed
excessive cost over-runs. It is felt that there were major technical changes, either at the
suggestion of the Engineering Consultant (Holderbank) or the Executing Agency (WCCL)
which resulted in increased investment outlays. The SAR estimated the cost of the project at
US$122.68 million equivalent to Rs.2,122 million. However, the actual cost of the project
has been determined at US$200.7 n equivalent to Rs.5,239 million. This cost of Rs.5,239
million has a local currency component of Rs.2,647 million financed by the SCCP and a
foreign currency portion of US$101.96 million equivalent to Rs.2,592 financed by the IBRD
loan.
(d)   The machinery faults and the cost over-runs have now raised serious questions
about the overall soundness of the investment in terms of its size, economy and efficiency. A
part of the cost over-run has been due to the heavy delays which have resulted in
accumulation of Interest During Construction (IDC). An IDC supposed to be accumulated
over three years has in this case got pilled up over a period of about seven years. In addition
to this, inflation in the local and international markets has also played a substantial role in the
cost escalation.
(e)   The deterioration in the exchange rate of US$ compared to the majority of
European currencies has also contributed to over-runs as the majority of the equipment
contracts were denominated in either the German Mark or the Danish Krone, while the loan
amount was extended in dollars the US currency. Another factor in this context is the taxes
and duties levied GOP on the import of equipment. In the original estimates, it was assumed
that all of the manufacturing equipment was exempt from import duty. Due to delays, the
electrical equipment was heavily taxed with the result the total figure of taxes and duties
came out to be Rs.645 million as compared to the SAR estimate of Rs.85 million. Had the
project come on stream as per the original schedule, the amount paid on account of taxes and
duties could have been saved. The import of electric/optional spares in relation to machinery
cost is also instrumental causing the cost over-runs. Though it is futile at this stage to
question the designing but there appears to be over designing of the basic critical
equipment/machinery.
(f)   Although the kiln was fired in November, 1994, the Wah plant started
commercial production on 1st April, 1995. The six month teething period was beset with
various serious problems. The major problem in this context was the damage of one of the
heavy duty motors at the raw mill. This damage resulted in a total shut down of the factory
for 68 days. A rented motor was later flown in while a new motor is still being manufactured
by the supplier. There were heavy production losses due to the defective machinery, not only
the motor but other parts of the plant. The project faced a number of other mechanical and
electrical problems. In this context, the absence of consequential loss clauses of the contract



- 38 -
signed with the suppliers also need highlighting. The absence of such clauses have seriously
affected the ability of SCCP to apply pressure on the supplier regarding their substandard
machinery. It is expected that this process, guarantee retiring may still take additional time.
The project is not as yet ready for the performance of overall guarantee runs as stipulated in
the contracts. The plant is still operating at a level below the targets capacity utilization.
Against the designed guaranteed norms of 690 kcal/kg of clinker, the present consumption
level is about 800 kcal/kg of clinker. It is anybody's guess whether the guaranteed norms
will ever be attained in a bid to be energy efficient plant.
2.          Balancing Modernization and Rehabilitation Program. This component
originally consisted of BMR of five of the SCCP units. Later on, the World Bank did not
agree to the funding of BMR at Javedan Cement as the company could not meet the financial
covenants, as specified in the SAR. This company was therefore dropped from the list of the
units. Work on the other four units; ZealPak, Maple Leaf, Gharibwal and Mustehkam
Cements, started simultaneously. The major chunk of this BMR was to be at ZealPak
Cement and Maple Leaf Cement. The privatization policy of the GOP led to the sale of three
of these four units, namely ZealPak, Maple Leaf and Gharibwal. The IBRD financed BMR
was not completely executed at the time when the management of these units was handed
over to the private sector. The Machinery and equipment had been imported and was lying at
the sites whereas the installation and commissioning had yet to be done. SCCP, on the
request of the World Bank, asked the new management of the two units, ZealPak and Maple
Leaf, to issue side letters to the existing Sub-Loan Agreements. These side letters were
undertakings from the new management that it would execute the BMR programs as
specified in the Loan and Project Agreements. The two units have now completely installed
the equipment under the supplier's supervision. Gharibwal Cement did not engage the
suppliers' personnel in installation of their equipment as the work was very small and their
own engineers have manage the job successfully. Mustehkam Cement is the only unit, out of
the four, which is left with SCCP. It was planned to install two Electrostatic Precipitators
(Eps) to control the dust emissions from this plant. These Eps have been installed as per
specifications, but the unit has still to install the monitoring equipment which will enable the
management to check the performance of these Eps.



- 39 -
(a)   Due to the privatization of three of the units, the complete cost data is not available
for this component of the CIMP. The local currency cost of the privatized units could not be
obtained despite numerous efforts. The IBRD loan disbursed for each of the UlitS is:
Name of Unit             US Dollar          Equivalent Ra.
- ZealPak Cement         8,653.254.22       218.83 1,278.20
- Maple Leaf Cement      6,723,761.08       169.876.273.84
- Gharibwal Cement         130,456.86          3.263.308. 39
- Mustehkam Cement       4,897,156.30       129.949.988.52
Total:                   20,404,628.46      521,920,848.95
3.          Corporate Strategy and Management Information. The consultancy
contract for the Design, Development and Implementation of a C'orporate Strategy and
Management Information System was awarded to M/s I-{olderbank Managemiient &
Consulting Limited, Switzerland. This contract was signed in May, 1988. The consultant's
team visited the SCCP Head Office and all of its units to gatlher information regarding the
existing systems and also to specify the requirements. A task force was created from with the
SCCP to work closely with the Holderbank team. The consultants presented various reports
at different stages of the project. The Corporate Strategy portion was completed and the draft
of the final report was presented to SCCP for its comments. Onl the MIS side, the first phase
was completed and the final report was presented. At that time, the privatization policy of
the GOP came into effect and the World Bank and SCCP mutually agreed that this
component of the CIMP should be suspended as it could not be implemented. The total
IBRD loan disbursed for this project was US$1,361,828.56 equivalenit to Rs.24.692,404.02.
No use of the reports has been made by SCCP and the remaining of its units.
4.          Human Resources Development(HRD). The contract for Design,
Development & Implementation of a HRD program was also awarded to M/s Holderbank
after following the World Bank procurement procedures. This contract was signed on 21st
August, 1989. The consultant's team started work on this project both at the SCCP H.O. and
their own Head Office in Switzerland. However, when the privatization process began,
SCCP decided to terminate the contract. By that time, Holderbank had already developed the
courseware for SCCP. The termination clause of the contract required SCCP to pay a certain
amount to the consultant. The consultant, in this case offered SCCP an option under which
SCCP could, by paying a little more than the termination money. buy the courseware
designed for it. SCCP opted for this and bought the courseware. The total loan disbursed for
this component is US$1,291,227.20 equivalent to Rs.21.445.671.97.



- 40 -
5.          Cement Research & Development Institute (CRDI). SCCP, as planned,
built a new building to house the upgraded CRDI. However, the World Bank had put
forward two conditions which this institute had to meet before the World Bank would finance
this sub-project. The first condition was that the title deed of the land, on which the building
was erected, should be cleared and obtained by the CRDI. The second condition was that it
should prepare a feasibility study showing its viability as an independent business entity.
The institute could not meet any of these conditions with the result that no disbursement from
the IBRD loan was made for it.
Performance of Borrower/Executing Agency
(a)   The Borrower of the IBRD Loan No. 2884-PAK was the GOP. The GOP on
the lent this loan amount, through the Subsidiary Loan Agreement, to the SCCP, who in this
case was the Executing Agency. The SCCP signed Sub-Loan Agreements with its units for
components Nos. 1 and 2. The implementation of the other three components was the
responsibility of SCCP.
(b)   In the case of this project, there were too many agencies involved in the
decision making process which resulted in project delays. It was partly the responsibility of
SCCP, to coordinate and implement well the various activities. However, the approvals for
each decision had to be taken from the GOP/World Bank and the bureaucratic red-tape often
led to a long processing/gestation time.
(b)   Had the project office been located at AC Wah premises as originally planned,
many of the coordination difficulties could have been resolved. Perhaps it could have
resulted in cutting down the delays and cost over-runs.
Performance of the World Bank
(a)   The World Bank staff has by large been cooperative and helpful. Throughout
the project implementation phase, the World Bank staff worked as a team with the SCCP.
(b)   In the case of the CIMP, the sanction of the Supplemental Loan by the World
Bank, through a rarity, was made available for its use to SCCP/WCCL.
(b)   One major problem that SCCP faced in dealing with the World Bank was the
long processing time of any requests and applications. Whenever any action was required by
the World Bank Head Office, there was a big time lag between the submission of the
application and the World Bank's response on it. In most of the cases, many reminders were
sent by SCCP before the World Bank could process a simple approval. In one case, the

World Bank sent its approval for a contract six months after the original submission of the
document. These extremely long delays were a hindrance in the smooth project
implementation and also generated a lot of unnecessary correspondence.
Conclusions and Recommendations
(a)   A complete project team, with clear cut job descriptions, should be prepared
before embarking on the implementation phase of the project.
(b)   Estimates, of both time and cost, should be made very carefully and
realistically after taking all of the factors into consideration. It is because the project
management has to explain any deviations from these estimates which can be a very time and
effort consuming exercise. If in the beginning, more time is spent in making realistic
estimate, the valuable time during the execution phase will be considerably saved. In case of
the CIMP, the time given in the SAR for the start up of the Wah project was only a couple of
months after the loan actually became effective. this was not at all realistic as a lot of work
has to e done before such a big contract is actually signed
