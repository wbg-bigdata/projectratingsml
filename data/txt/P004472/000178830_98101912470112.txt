PHILIPPINES
SAMAR ISLAND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of the Philippines has requested Bank assistance
in financing a Rural Development Project on the island of Samar. The project
would include road construction and port improvements; a communal irrigation
program; schistosomiasis control measures; a rural water program for small
villages; and assistance in preparation of a development plan for the Catubig
valley. The project would be a part of the Government's overall program of
development of Samar island in which both Japan and Australia are partici-
pating.
1.02      The Project Planning and Development Office (PPDO) of the Ministry
of Public Works was responsible for coordinating the preparation of the
project.  The present report is based on the findings  of an appraisal
mission composed of Messrs. E.G. Giglioli, A.J. Carmichael, B.H. Liese and
V. Talvadkar (Bank) and D. Bradley, L. Bird and R. Strang (Consultants),
which visited the Philippines in February 1979 and of a follow-up mission
comprising Messrs. E.G. Giglioli, A.J. Carmichael and V. Talvadkar (Bank)
and Mr. R. Strang (Consultant) which visited the Philippines in June 1979.
Area Development
1.03      In order to promote the accelerated development of previously
neglected or backward rural areas and to reduce the movement of people from
the countryside to the towns, the Government embarked on a program of
Integrated Area Development (IAD) in the early seventies. The concept of
IAD involves the close coordination and synchronization of the various
agencies of the Government for the most effective utilization of limited
resources leading to the development of a selected geographical area.
Priority for inclusion in the program is given to areas with:
a) potential for development in more than one sector;
b) low incomes;
c) potential for rapid development; and
d) requirements for relatively small incremental
investments to generate high benefits.
*          The most common project components include transport development, particularly
roads and ports; irrigation, flood control and drainage; health, education and
water supply facilities; and agricultural support facilities and services.
While the degree of integration of the programs, in terms of interdependence
of the various components, is not notable, it is evident in terms of coordi-
nation of line agencies working in different sectors.



1.04      The Cabinet Coordinating Committee on Integrated Rural Development
Projects (CCC/IRDP) was created in 1973 as the policy making and governing
body for all rural development projects. In late 1978, the role of the CCC
was taken over by the newly established National Council on Integrated Area
Development (NACIAD). The Mindoro Rural Development Project, initiated in
1975 with assistance from the Bank (Loan 1102-PH), was the first in the
series of projects generated under the IAD program. Others include the
Bicol River Basin Development Program and the Cagayan Integrated Rural
Development Project.  Also included in the program, although with a lesser
emphasis on area development, is the Rural Infrastructure Project, covering
six provinces in Luzon and the Visayas and started in 1978 with Bank Group
assistance (Cr. 790-PH). Samar island was chosen for inclusion in the CCC's
program from the beginning of the program. Because of its poverty, backward-
ness, high outmigration, low level of infrastructure and considerable
potential for development, Samar was an obvious choice for the IAD program.
Work on preparation of a development program for the island began in 1974
under the leadership of the PPDO. By late 1976 preparatory work had
advanced to the point where the Government formally recognized the existence
of a Samar project in Presidential Decree No. 1048 and created the Samar
Integrated Rural Development Project Office (SIRDPO) to coordinate the
planning and implementation of the project.
Development of Samar
1.05      The plan prepared by the PPDO for the development of Samar calls
for priority attention to five major sectors: provision of transport infra-
structure; intensification of agricultural services; efficiency in the
management of water resources; improvement of health care delivery, and
provision of essential utilities.
1.06      The transportation component of the plan envisages the construction
and improvement of about 500 km of secondary roads and 370 km of feeder roads.
Most of the roads would be in Northern and Eastern Samar. The Philippines
Japan Friendship Highway (PJFH) running along the west cost of the island
(234 km) together with the accompanying 72 km of access roads to be built on
the island to maximize the PJFH effectiveness under the Japanese Commodity
Loan, would cater for most of the needs of Western Samar. The upgrading and
rehabilitation of the ports of Catbalogan, San Jose, Guiuan and Dolores is
included in the transportation development proposal.
1.07      The agricultural intensification element of the plan proposes a
five-year program of crop and farm improvement, covering improved seed
production, greater use of fertilizer and agrochemicals and improved
cultural practices in selected pilot areas. The program would be supported
by an augmented, better managed and more mobile extension service. Initial
emphasis would be placed on rainfed rice, corn and coconuts in the
municipalities of Catubig, Gandara and Dolores.
1.08      The water resources aspect of the plan calls for the development of
two national irrigation systems, covering about 7,350 ha, and eight communal
systems of about 2,500 ha. In addition flood control and drainage provisions



- 3 -
would be made in the Catubig valley in Northern Samar to protect some
45 sq km of land.
1.09      Under the plan, improvement of the health care delivery system
would be obtained by construction throughout the island of about 60 rural
health units (RHU) and some 190 barangay health stations (BHS).  In addition
a schistosomiasis control campaign would be mounted in the 32 municipalities
in which the disease is endemic.
*          1.10      The public utilities aspects of the plan include the provision of
water, power and telecommunications. The water supply component calls for
the construction of about 2,500 wells and the development of about 100 springs
to serve small villages and hamlets throughout Samar. While the National
Electrification Administration (NEA) and the National Power Corporation (NPC)
investigate the hydroelectric potential of the Catubig river, the plan calls
for installation of diesel powered generators to service Northern and
Eastern Samar. The development plan proposes the establishement of a
transmission network capable of providing both telephone and telegraphy
services, with the three provincial capitals of Catarman, Catbalogan and
Borongan as transmission control centers.
Australian Assistance to Samar Development
1.11      Under a memorandum of agreement signed on January 29, 1979,
the Governments of Australia and the Philippines defined the scope of
Australian assistance to the development of Samar. The Australian contri-
bution would amount to the equivalent of US$28.0 million, in the form of a
grant. Project implementation is expected to take five years, in two
stages. Stage I would cover the project components described in the 1979
agreement, a possible Stage II could include components chosen from the
development plan for the island prepared by the PPDO-SIRDPO, subject to
detailed evaluation of their economic and technical feasibility and the
availability of aid resources. Stage I would include provisions for such
studies.
1.12      Stage I of the Australian-assisted project would include the
following components:
a)   Roads.  Development of about 180 km of roads in Northern Samar,
of which 160 km of national and provincial roads to two-lane
cement concrete standard and the remainder feeder roads to
two-lane gravel standard; subject to the outcome of additional
studies, construction of about 240 km of agricultural feeder roads;
assistance through provision of training, equipment and workshop
facilities to road maintenance at the provincial level in Nothern
Samar.



- 4 -
(b)   Ports.  Rehabilitation and expansion of the port of San Jose
in Northern Samar.
(c)   Water Supply.  Construction of piped water supplies in the towns
of Allen, Catarman, Laoang, Catubig and Las Navas.
(d)   Power.  Implementation of an electrical supply and distribution
scheme to transmit power from a diesel generating station at
Wright in Western Samar to Catarman and hence to significant
population centers along the coast of Northern Samar between
Allen and Laoang.
(e)   Agriculture.  Assistance to improve agricultural performance
through provision of agricultural development centers, pilot crop
and demonstration farms, extension service aids, equipment vehi-
cular support and technical assistance.
Technical assistance would be an important project component, as provision
is made for about 740 man-months of consultant's time, of which about 330 man-
months for engineering services and about 255 for agricultural specialists.
Prolect Formulation
1.13      The development plan for Samar prepared by the PPDO-SIRDPO provided
the main parameters for formulation of the project. In addition, considera-
tion was given to the objectives of the Australian-assisted project centered
on Northern Samar, to the Japan-assisted road development along the PJFH in
Western Samar and to the locally financed road developments aimed at connect-
ing the Northern and Eastern Samar road networks and at improving the island's
airfields, as well as providing support to the fishing industry. The
strengthening of agricultural extension services throughout the island, due to
be implemented under the Bank Group-assisted National Extension Project
(Ln. 1626-PH), and the improvement of health care delivery infrastructure in
Samar envisaged under the Second Population Project (Cr. 923-PH) were also
taken into account. The proposed project would be complimentary to ongoing
development activities in the island, would give a degree of emphasis to
Eastern Samar, the most isolated of the three provinces, and would avoid
duplication of efforts.
1.14      Improvement of the transportation infrastructure would be the
largest component in the proposed project, reflecting the poor state of the
facilities in the island and the high priority given by the Government to the
rehabilitation and upgrading of roads and ports as a precondition to other
development activities. The small irrigation component would be aimed
principally at developing improved methods of operation and maintenance of
the irrigation systems by the farmer beneficiaries. The past failures of
communal irrigation systems in the island have been due to the inability of
the farmers to effectively utilize and maintain the facilities built for them.
The village wells and schistosomiasis control elements would contribute to
raising the standard and quality of life in the small rural communities, where
most of the people of Samar live.



- 5 -
1.15      This would be the fourth Bank Group-assisted rural development
project in the Philippines. The others are the Rural Development Project
(Mindoro) (Loan 1102-PH), the Rural Development (Land Settlement) Project
(Loan 1421-PH) and the Rural Infrastructure Project I (Credit 790-PH). The
Mindoro project is similar to the proposed project with components for
communal irrigation, roads and a port and schistosomiasis control. Progress
on the project was initially disappointing due to slow mobilization and
difficulties with the contractors' building the roads, however, the situation
has improved and the rate of implementation of the various components, while
still slow , is steady. The Land Settlement project also suffered from
mobilization problems, but is now making good physical progress. Work on
the communal irrigation systems, village wells, health centers and ports
included in the Rural Infrastructure project is proceeding very well, while
progress on the road component is slow. The relatively poor initial
progress of such projects involving a large number of implementing agencies
is due to the more difficult task of coordination and the unfamiliarity of
some of the agencies with Bank requirements and procedures.

2. THE PROJECT AREA
General
2.01      Samar, with an area of about 13,428 sq km, is the third largest
island in the Philippines (Map No. 14344). The island lies southeast of the
Bicol peninsula in Luzon and northeast of Leyte. It measures approximately
255 km at its longest and 90 km at its widest. The principal city of the
island, Catbalogan, is some 635 km from Manila. The island is divided
administratively into three provinces: Northern Samar, Western Samar and
Eastern Samar. The terrain is generally rugged with narrow and discontinuous
coastal plains and restricted river valleys. Most of the island is rolling
and hilly and the interior consists of highly dissected hills and mountain
peaks reaching altitudes of over 800 m. The rivers of Samar are relatively
long and fairly deep. Most of them are navigable by small boats and the
bigger rivers can be used by launches and larger craft up to 35 km inland.
Much of the transport of agricultural products from the interior of the island
is by these rivers. Population density in all three provinces is substan-
tially below the national average, with Eastern Samar the most sparsely
populated province. Per capita incomes range from about 84% of the national
average for Western Samar to less than 50% for Eastern Samar. Statistical
data for each province are shown in Table 2.1.

Climate
2.02      Four distinct climatic types are found in the Philippines,
depending on the amount and distribution of rainfall. Two of these types,
the second and the fourth, prevail in Samar. The second type, found in
Northern and Eastern Samar, is characterized by a very pronounced wet season
between November and January and no dry season; while the fourth type, found
in Western Samar, has no maximum rainy period and no dry season. Average
annual rainfall varies from a low of about 2,600 mm in Western Samar to
nearly 4,300 mm in the Eastern province. There is little monthly variation
in temperatures and relative humidities throughout the year or between the
three provinces. The rainfall is generally adequate for two rice crops in
Eastern Samar, but supplementation with irrigation is required to varying
degrees in the other two provinces. The island lies well within the typhoon
belt and storms are frequent. A large proportion of the typhoons that occur
in the Philippines either pass by or originate east of the island. November
and December are the months of highest risk. Climatological data in a
summarized form are given in Table 2.2.
Topography, Drainage and Soils
2.03      Only about 11% of the area of Samar island is classified as flat,
62% as rolling and 27% as mountainous. The flat areas are found in a long
narrow strip running along the coast in Northern Samar, in small pockets
along the eastern and western coasts and in the valleys of some of the
bigger rivers, such as the Catarman and Catubig in Northern Samar, the Oras
and Dolores in Eastern Samar and the Gandara and Jibatan in Western Samar.
The mountainous area is divided into two, an isolated portion in the
northwestern corner of Samar and the main north to south range of hills
running down the length of the island, with the ridge line roughly along the
provincial boundary between Eastern and Western Samar. Drainage in the flat
lands, particularly in the river valleys, tends to be poor due to the high
rainfall, the high runoff from the surrounding hills, the restricted areas of
the valleys and the poor internal drainage of the soils. The Bureau of Soils
(BS) has classified the soils of Samar into three general categories: plain
and valley soils; intermediate upland soils; and soils of the hills, mountains
and miscellaneous land types (swamps, beach sands, riverwash and stony land).
Table 2.3, derived from BS soil survey reports, shows the areas falling into
the various categories.
2.04      Five soil series account for nearly 80% of the plain and valley
soils. Loams of the San Manuel series are the predominant type and are
widely distributed in all three provinces. The San Manuel soils are pale or
grayish brown, loose and friable with good drainage, pHs of 6 to 7, good
fertility and are suitable for diversified cropping. The main soil type in

the intermediate upland group is a clay loam of the Catbalogan series. It
accounts for about a third of the total area of the island. It is moderately
deep soil derived from weathered shale and sandstone, with shale predominat-
ing.  The surface is grayish brown, with a coarse granular to blocky struc-
ture. The soil has a slow permeability and excessive surface run-off. Crops
grown are upland rice, abaca, bananas, sweet potato, coconuts and cassava.
The uncultivated areas are covered with cogon grass and secondary forest.
Population, Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.05      Of the 1.1 million people living in Samar, about 30% are in
Northern Samar, 45% in Western Samar and 25% in Eastern Samar. Almost 82%
of the population lives in rural areas. Between 1960 and 1970 the annual
population growth for the island was 1.7% compared to a national growth rate
of about 3%. The low rate of growth was due to heavy emigration to Luzon,
Cebu and Mindanao. Emigration was particularly noticeable in the 15 to 25
year age group and women accounted for about 60% of the migrants.
2.06      According to the 1971 Census of Agriculture, there are 87,600 farms
in the three Samar provinces occupying about 357,700 ha. Table 2.4 shows
the farm size distribution and average farm size for each province. Rice
and corn farms represent about 30% of all the farms and 33% of the farm area
of the three Samar provinces. Rice farms account for 25% of all farms and
24% of farm area and range in average size from 2.6 ha in Western Samar to
5.2 ha in Northern Samar. Coconut farms represent 48% of the farmers and
53% of the farm area and range in average size from 3.6 ha in Western Samar
to 5.2 ha in Northern Samar.

2.07      Since 1972 the Government has pursued a program of agrarian reform
aimed at the transfer of land ownership to tenant farmers on rice and corn
lands. Presidential Decree No. 27 (PD 27), the basic legislation of the
program, provides for the transfer to the tenant, whether sharecropper or
leaseholder, of up to 3 ha in an irrigated area and 5 ha in a rainfed area.
According to PD 27, the landowner may retain up to 7 ha if he tills the land
himself. The Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR) completed in 1975 the issue
of land transfer certificates to tenants for all lands in holdings over 24 ha.
In November 1974, the Government decided to proceed with the transfer of land
in holdings between 24 and 7 ha. In October 1976, the Government extended
the provisions of PD 27 to holdings of less than 7 ha, belonging to
landowners with more than 7 ha of other agricultural land, or belonging to
landowners with residential, commercial or urban land from which they derive
adequate incomes to support themselves. It is not known how many landlords
and tenants would be affected by the new legislation. Table 2.5 shows the
tenurial status of rice farmers in the three Samar provinces at the time
of the 1970 agricultural census. The degree of tenancy was remarkably low,
particularly in Eastern Samar. The principal form of tenancy was share
cropping, a practice officially outlawed by PD 27. The progress of land
reform in the island has been slow, by the end of 1977 the MAR had issued
about 19000 land transfer certificates for some 1i500 ha.

Agricultural Production
2.08      Coconuts are by far the most important crop in Samar.  About
170,000 ha are under the crop in the island with 45% of the area in Northern
Samar, 33% in Eastern Samar and 22% in Western Samar. The percentage of non-
bearing trees ranges from 45% in the Western province to 38% in the Northern
province. This is very close to the national average of 40%. Copra produc-
tion from the island is about 87,000 tons, with a mean yield/ha of bearing
trees of about 1.0 ton. Yields in Eastern Samar in terms of copra and nut
bearing trees are slightly lower than in the other provinces due to the area's
greater exposure to typhoons. The trees are chiefly unselected tall vari-
ties. Cadang-cadang disease is endemic throughout Northern Samar and is found
in a narrow strip along the coast of Western Samar at the mouth of the Jibatan
river and on the southern tip of Eastern Samar around Guiuan.
2.09      Paddy is grown on about 82,000 ha, with about 40% of the area in
Northern Samar and the balance evenly divided between the other two provinces.
Cropping intensity is however lowest in the North at 106% compared to 123% in
the East and West. The area under irrigation is negligible. The standards of
crop husbandry are poor, with superficial land preparation, minimal use of
inputs and no bunding around the fields. Yields average less than 1.0 ton of
paddy/ha. About 22,000 ha of corn are grown mostly in Western Samar. Culti-
vation standards are poor, little or no fertilizer is used and weed control is
inadequate. Yields are consequently low at about 1.0 ton/ha. A variety of
root crops is grown on some 27,000 ha, mostly in Northern and Western Samar.
Sweet potatoes are the dominant crop, although substantial areas of cassava
and Colocasia are found in Western Samar. Mean yields run at about 2.5 ton/ha
for sweet potatoes and Colocasia and 4.8 ton/ha for cassava. About 12,000 ha
of abaca are grown in the island, mostly in the North. Average yields of
about 0.3 ton/ha dry fiber are low. About 15,000 ha of bananas are grown for
local consumption, evenly divided between the three provinces. Northern Samar
has the most diversified agriculture of the island, while Eastern Samar has
the narrowest base and is heavily dependent on coconuts.

EfisUr  Tr ansport Facilities
2r10      The total length of roads in Samar island is about 3,235 km
(Table 2.6). Of these, 710 km are classified as national, 505 km are
provincial, 300 are municipal and 1,720 are feeder or barangay roads.  Eastern
Samar accounts for 1,595 km, while Northern and Western Samar each have 820 km
of roads. Of the 710 km of national roads, only 34% or 245 km have bitumi-
nous or concrete pavements. The Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway (PJFH),
running along the west coast of the island from the bridge connecting to Leyte
across the San Juanico straits to the port of Allen in the North (228 km),
accounts for virtually all the concrete paved national highways. The
remainder are gravel surfaced. Most of the provincial roads and virtually all
the barangay roads are either gravel or earth surfaced. With the exception of
the PJFH and municipal roads within some of the larger towns, most of the
roads are in a bad state of repair, due largely to indequate maintenance.
Bridges along the coastal roads in the North and East are dilapidated, many to
the point of being unusable. River transport plays an important complementary
role, particularly in Northern Samar. In the northeastern section of the
island water transport is virtually the only means of transport. Roads are
practically non-exister_ and the population is concentrated along the coast
and rivers. Movement of goods and passengers is almost exclusively by pump-
boat. These routes are hazardous and are frequently closed because of bad
weather.

2.11      There are four national ports in Samar, two of which are classified
as ports of entry and two as national secondary ports. The ports of San Jose
in Northern Samar and Catbalogan in Western Samar fall in the first group and
Calbayog and Borongan in Eastern Samar are in the second group.  In addition
t >ere are 52 municipal ports serving the transportation needs of the inhabi-
t,.nts in the coastal areas. Of these, 12 are in the north, 15 in the east and
2' in the west.  In 1978, some 665 vessels called at Catbalogan, carrying a
total of 143,800 passengers and 70,600 tons of cargo. San Jose had 385 ships,
53,000 tons of cargo and 11,000 passengers. On the eastern coast Borongan
registered 195 ships, and 21,500 tons of cargo, while Calbayog was visited by
480 ships, with 77,700 tons of cargo and 19,900 passengers. There are three
airports in the island of which Calbayog and Catarman are classified as



- 13 -
secondary and (uitian as a feeder airport. Some 18,000 passengers passed
through these facilities in 1974.  In addition, there are two private air
fields, one in Western .and one in Northern Samar.
Existing Irrigation Facilities
2.12      lTiere are only about 2,100 ha under irrigation in Samar, of which
900 ha are in Northern Samar, 700 in Eastern Samar and 500 in Western Samar.
There are no national irrigation systems operated by the National Irrigation
Administration (NIA).  There are about 30 communal systems covering 1,000 ha,
built by NIA, but operated and maintained by the farmers without technical
supervision. In addition, there are some 35 privately built gravity systems
serving 300 ha and about 75 privately owned pumps providing irrigation to
800 ha. All the systems are small, the level of engineering is rudimentary
and the condition of the systems is poor due to lack of competent operation
and maintenance.
Water Supply Facilities
2.13      Outside of the larger centers, people in Samar obtain water for
domestic uses from a variety of sources, many of which are contaminated. Some
1,100 wells have been dug in the rural areas, 40% of which are currently
nonfunctional, due to lack of maintenance, faulty construction or decline in
water quality. However, about 330 of the non-operational wells could be put
back in order with small expenditures on deferred maintenance and spare
parts. In addition about 210 springs have been developed as water supplies.

The status of wells and distribution by province is shown in Table 2.7. In
Northern Samar there are roughly 1,000 members of farm families per water
supply point, compared to about 500 in Western Samar and 300 in Eastern
Samar.
Public Health
2.14       The health situation in Samar compares unfavorably with national
norms. Leading causes of mortality and morbidity include respiratory
diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, tuberculosis and schistosomiasis, all



- 14 -
with high prevalences.  This results in large part from the inadequacy of the
present health care system which forces the population to rely on traditional
practitioners and folk remedies. The provincial health offices are under-
staffed. Physician-to-population ratios in the three provinces range from 28%
to 46% of the national average and only from 7% to 12% of World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) recommendations. Only 20% of rural health units have a physi-
cian, a situation that has not been improving over time. Health problems are
exacerbated by the lack of safe domestic water supplies and poor environmental
and sanitation practices.
2.15      Aside from the serious lack of health care facilities and services,
schistosomiasis is the most important chronic, debilitating public health
problem in Samar, particularly for agricultural workers who are most at risk
and upon whom the island's economy depends. In 1976, it was reported as one
of the leading causes of both mortality and morbidity. In 1975, the disease
was reported as endemic in 32 municipalities in the island, of which 11 are in
Northern Samar, 9 in Eastern Samar and 12 in Western Samar. There were an
estimated 97,000 cases in a total exposed population in the affected munici-
palities of 745,000, a prevalence rate of 13%. Surveys in Western Samar have
shown highly endemic areas in the municipalities of Gandara and Basey with a
prevalence in adults exceeding 30% on a single diagnostic examination, an
equally high prevalence in school children, and extensive areas of snail
habitat, of which the most serious have been mapped. A few hundred cases seek
treatment at Catbalogan each year and advanced cases with ascites are readily
found in both clinics and villages. Surveys have begun more recently in
Northern Samar and show a high prevalence in the municipalities of Bobon and
Palapag. There is, at present, little information from Eastern Samar.

- 16 -
Roads
3.02      Prolect Works.  The road component of the project would consist of
200 km of the Eastern Samar coastal road from Oras in the north to Guiuan in
the south, and about 30 km of the road from Taft on the east coast to the
provincial boundary of Eastern and Western Samar. These are all classified as
national roads. The proposed improvement would include widening of narrow
portions of roadway and shoulders, correction of substandard horizontal and
vertical alignment, provision of adequate drainage facilities, raising of
flooded portions, and gravelling of the pavement. For unbridged river
crossings and existing temporary bridges, the project would provide for
construction of two-lane reinforced concrete deck girder bridges, amounting to
about 1,670 linear metres. The bridge works represent the minimum number
required and least cost structures to provide an all-weather road. The
project does not include any provision for equipment and workshop facilities
for the maintenance of these roads as these would be provided under the Fourth
Highway Project (Loan 1661-PH).
3.03      Existing sections of the roads on reasonably satisfactory alignments
would be improved by restoring the formation to the specified width and
profile, and where the CBR (California Bearing Ratio) of the subgrade is
higher than 4%, the provision of a levelling course of screened sub-base
material and a 15 cm thick crushed basecourse pavement. Existing asphalt
sections, totaling 30 km, would be overlayed with Double Bituminous Surface
Treatment (DBST) wherever needed. All sections with unsatisfactory soil
conditions, steep gradients or sharp horizontal curvatures would be realigned.
Two sections totalling about 16.0 km would be constructed on completely new
alignments to obtain shorter bridge crossings upstream of points at present
served by small ferries. On newly constructed sections of road the pavement
would consist of 15 cm of sub-base material and 15 cms of basecourse material.
Where sections are liable to flooding the embankment would be raised on an
average by 50 cm, and the top 30 cm layer of the fill would be of granular
material, while the pavement would consist of 20 cm of screened sub-base and
15 cm of crushed basecourse.
3.04      Design Standards.  The roads would have 6.0 m width roadway in flat
and rolling terrain and 5.0 m in mountainous terrain. The width of the
shoulders, which would vary according to the type of terrain, would average
1.0 m. The maximum slope of side cut would be 1 horizontal to 1 vertical
(1:1) for earth and 1:4 for rock and a longitudinal slope of 3% and 4% has
been adopted for the pavement and shoulders respectively. The proposed
geometric standards for the roads are summarized in Annex 1, Table 1.
3.05      Due to intense storms and frequent typhoons, particular attention
would be paid to drainage and cross drainage structures. Drainage structures
would be standard reinforced concrete box or pipe culverts, designed to take
care of 25-year floods. Drainage ditches along both sides of the roads would
carry flows for floods of 25-year frequency. Protection works would be
standard such as gabions, approach riprap, retaining walls and guard-rails.
Bridge superstructure designs were based on the standard type of reinforced
concrete deck girder bridges for secondary roads. The substructure designs
were based on standard type abutments such as the retaining wall type for



- 17 -
relatively high embankments and the pile-bent type for low embankments. In
the case of piers, the standard open type consisting of two columns and a cap
for bridge seat was used.
3.06      Status of Engineering.  Preliminary project planning studies,
designs and estimates were carried out by the Project Planning and
Development Service (PPDS) of MPH in coordination with the provincial MPH
office in Eastern Samar. An inventory of the physical characteristics,
topographical conditions, existing geometric designs, existing drainage and
drainage requirements was prepared for the feasibility report. Detailed
design work has been carried out by two local consulting firms and the
improvement standards used have been generally in accordance with the
findings and recomsendations of the feasibility study. Fully detailed
horizontal - longitudinal profiles and cross-sections have been prepared and
earthwork quantities calculated. Soil surveys and pavement design are
complete. Subsurface exploration for the foundations of bridge abutments
and piers has been completed. Final design of bridges and preparation of
contract documents, which is now in progress, is expected to be completed by
the end of 1979. All material resource surveys to ascertain availability of
construction materials and costs have been carried out. The construction of
these roads is expected to begin in late 1980 and be completed by end 1983.
3.07      Construction Supervision.  Supervision would be undertaken by the
MPH regional office and consultants would be hired to assist in supervision.
An assurance was obtained that MPH would engage construction supervision
consultants satisfactory to the Bank under terms of reference and conditions
agreed with the Bank.
Ports
3.08      Description of Present Facilities.  The port of Catbalogan in
Western Samar would be rehabilitated and improved under the project. The
port is located west of the town and commercial district of Catbalogan, the
capital of Western Samar. It is situated near the center of the western
coastline of Samar and close to the western end of the highway connecting
the typhoon prone eastern coast of Samar to the relatively sheltered western
coast. Its main facilities are two reinforced concrete piers: Pier 1, 140 m
x 90 m and Pier 2, 70 m x 15 m. Both piers are in poor physical condition
and in urgent need of maintenance. The bulkhead between the piers is
partially destroyed and a narrow, rock causeway, near Pier 1, is used for
local "pump boats" for loading and unloading passengers and small packages.
The remainder of the port facilities are two small sheds, one for passengers
and the other for storing of cargo. The average length of vessels servicing
the port is about 50 m, and mDst of them are of the passenger/cargo type.
The harbor depth varies from 3 to 7 m at Low Water Ordinary Spring Tide
(LWOST) and the tidal range is 1.5 m.  Each pier is connected with a
concrete road to the national highway.
3.09      Prolect Works.  The development of the port has been planned to
provide sufficient capacity for current and projected passenger and cargo
traffic, bearing in mind the trends of interisland shipping in the Philippines
with respect to size and type of vessels. Although larger and faster vessels
are being employed in the Philippines, such vessels can be expected to ply on



- 18 -
the more intensively-utilized routes, based on Manila and Cebu and on islands
with greater population and productive capacities than Samar. Therefore, the
facilities to be provided under the project would cater for existing vessel
types plus those vessels on other routes which are likely to be displaced by
more modern and competitive ships in the next few years. Roll-on/roll-off
vessels are relatively few in the Philippines today and local ship owners do
not consider it likely that they will be used extensively in the Samar trade
for many years. A survey of Pier 1 has indicated that its condition is so
dilapidated that its rehabilitation would be uneconomic. Instead, Pier No. 2
would be repaired and extended by 70 m to provide a total of 140 x 15 m
reinforced concrete pier which would be sufficient to cater for the projected
cargo and passengers. In order to provide facilities for vessels during the
construction period, temporary repairs of Pier 1 would be undertaken. The
depth alongside would be 5.5 m at LWOST which is sufficient for the projected
size of vessels that would use the facilities. Repairs to the existing
bulkhead and improvement to the port's working area would be carried out. One
passenger shed and two transit sheds, each 600 sq m, would be erected and
water and lighting services would be installed.
3.10      Status of Engineering.  Project planning and cost estimates were
prepared by the Harbors and Ports Division of the Ministry of Public Works
(MPW) in conjunction with the Philippines Port Authority (PPA). Cost esti-
mates have been based on an engineering survey of the site including marine
borings in the approaches to the port and at the construction site. Records
of the piles driven in the existing Pier No. 2 have been used, along with the
new boreholes, to help assess the lengths of piles required in the new exten-
sion. MPW is expected to finalize the design and prepare contract documents
by end-1979. MPW would supervise construction, which is expected to start in
mid-1980 and be completed by end 1981 (Figure 3.1).
Irrigation
3.11      Project Works.  The project would provide for the construction of
new irrigation facilities for the Palali communal irrigation system in
Northern Samar serving 500 ha, the Calapi communal irrigation system in
Western Samar serving 300 ha, and about 1,200 ha of, as yet unidentified,
communal irrigation systems in Northern and Western Samar. All systems
would be served by gravity irrigation based on run-of-the-river supply.
Diversion would be done by either a diversion weir or an intake structure
depending on the topography.
3.12      The diversion works for the Palali system would be a concrete weir
with a crest 5.0 m above the stream bed, a gated sluiceway and gated intake
works. Diversion at the Calapi system would be by an intake structure only.
The intake structure would be a constant head orifice turnout as capacity will
be less than 1.0 cu m/sec0 The conveyance system for both Palali and Calapi



- 19 -
would consist of unlined earth canals with a provision for lining in portions
with erosive soils. For effective control of water deliveries, check
structures and gated turnouts would be provided. For smaller systems of areas
less than 100 ha, the main canal would also serve as a distribution channel.
For larger systems, if required, secondary unlined canals would be provided.
The proposed level of on-farm distribution is similar to that being
implemented in other Bank Group-assisted projects such as the Philippine Rural
Infrastructure Project (Credit 790-PH). The main farm ditch serving a
rotational area of about 30-50 ha would be built under the project. Gravel
surfaced O&M roads 3.5 m wide with 15 cm thick gravel surfacing would be built
by NIA along all main canals. Systems with drainage problems would be
provided with main or secondary drains; farm drainage in most systems would be
from field to field.
3.13      Status of Engineering.  The Project Development Department (PDD) of
NIA has prepared detailed engineering, design and cost estimates for the
Palali and Calapi systems which account for 40% of the irrigation service area
included in the project. The diversion sites were surveyed and topographic
mapping of the service area was undertaken at a 1:4,000 scale, field location
surveys and profiling of the main and secondary canals has been completed.
Location and sizing of structures along these canals, and quantity estimates
for on-farm ditches and drains have been finalized. Detailed drawings are
presently being prepared for the two systems.
3.14      The topographic maps of 1:4,000 scale used in the two systems were
prepared by conventional ground survey methods. Topographic maps of the same
scale for the remaining 1,200 ha of unidentified systems would be prepared in
the same way and would be used for detailed planning and design of all works.
Construction of the irrigation systems would begin in mid-1980 (Figure 3.1)
and all systems are expected to be completed by mid-1983.
3.15      Preparation and Evaluation Procedures.  In order to ensure that the
as yet unidentified systems proposed for implementation under the project are
technically feasible and economically viable, the following procedure would be
implemented in the preparation and evaluation of the systems:
(a) preparation of scheme proposals by NIA's regional office including
topographic surveys and mapping, suitability of soils, water
availability and quality, preliminary layouts and estimates of
potential cropping intensity, present and potential yields, cost
estimates and economic analysis (satisfactory technical criteria
have been developed under the Rural Infrastructure Project
(Credit 790-PH));
(b) evaluation of scheme proposals by a multi-disciplinary team con-
sisting of senior staff from the PDD of NIA based on the following
criteria:
(i) cropping intensity would be 130% or more;
(ii) economic rate of return would be 10% or more;



- 20 -
(iii)  all fanrners in the proposed system have been organized into an
Irrigation Service Association (ISA) and properly registered;
and
(iv)  the Farm Systems Development Corporation (FSDC) has entered
into a loan agreement with the ISA to repay NIA the cost of
constructing the system; and
(c) the evaluation team would produce an Evaluation Report which would
become the basis of detailed design to be carried out by the
regional office.
3.16      An assurance was obtained that NIA would submit to the Bank
for review prior to implementation an evaluation report for systems costing
more than P 3.0 million and summary data forms for the remaining systems.
Agreement has been reached on the content and format of evaluation
reports and summary data forms under the Rural Infrastructure Project
(Credit 790-PH).
3.17      Irrigable Areas.  Based on hydrological studies conducted by NIA,
about 300 ha could be irrigated in the dry season in Palali and 100 ha
in Calapi. Adequate water supply is available to meet the supplementary
irrigation requirement of each system during the wet season. It has been
assumed that the 1,200 ha of unidentified systems would have a cropping
intensity of 130%, the minimum requirement for selection. The irrigable
areas selected for development under the project are summarized below:

Cropping intensity (%)           160         130            130            140
Although the future irrigable areas for each system would be determined
taking into account the water rights of existing users, assurances were
obtained from the Government that the necessary water rights for each
system would be granted to the concerned ISA and no other rights except for
domestic use, w'hich could adversely affect the project water supply would be
granted except by mutual agreement with the Banko

Water Supply
3.18      Project Works.  The project would provide for the construction and
rehabilitation of about 2,300 wells and 300 springs in small rural communi-
ties.  About 45% of the wells and springs would be located in Western Samar,
28% in Northern Samar, and 27% in Eastern Samar. The wells, with a depth from
35 to 80 feet depending on the aquifer characteristics, would be operated by
standard hand pumps. The wells and springs would serve as point sources,
without any distribution and reticulation, for an average of 250 people. Each
well and spring would be constructed in a fenced site and a washing/bathing
platform would be built at some distance, care would be taken to avoid low
spots subject to flooding or sites immediately downslope of contaminant
sources. The villagers would provide, free of charge, the land for the well
and the access road, as well as labor to construct the road and fencing.
Based on limited records of the chemical content of groundwater in Samar,
about 25% of the wells in Northern Samar and 15% of the wells in Eastern Samar
would need simple treatment systems. The most common problem of water quality
has been high iron content. Water samples from each well would be analyzed to
determine whether filtration systems would be needed. The project would
provide for the construction of simple Frankel filters. Facilities for the
repair and maintenance of vehicles, equipment and pumps would be provided in
each province since MPW does not have such facilities in Samar at present.
The project would also provide for visits of key MPW personnel to similar
Bank-assisted village water supply projects in neighboring countries, training
in the operation and maintenance of drilling equipment, and for production and
distribution of materials instructing local communities on the procedures for
maintenance and proper operation of the wells and springs. The works are ex-
pected to be completed by end-1984.
3.19      Hydrogeology.  The proposed construction and improvement of wells
and springs would be generally within an area that extends about 10 km inland
from the coast and on some of the smaller outlying islands. Principal aqui-
fers include the thick sequence of interbedded sandstone, shale and conglo-
merate of the Catbalogan formation; fractured or jointed igneous rocks; and
alluvial sands and gravels or near-shore coralline limestone. Recharge from
rainfall is much more than enough to support the proposed small groundwater
withdrawals. Annual precipitation generally ranges from 2,500 to more than
4,000 mm. Even in the driest periods, there is sufficient recharge to support
a much larger program of shallow wells with small yield. The existence of
many hundreds of comparable small wells has proven the availability and
dependability of the groundwater source. Water quality is generally good for
domestic purposes throughout Samar. The only problems are local occurrences
of water with high dissolved iron, correctible with aeration and filtration,
or occasional instances of salt water contamination immediately adjacent to
the ocean.
3.20      Selection, Design and Construction Criteria.  In order to reduce
costs and minimize maintenance, while at the same time meeting public health
standards, the following criteria would be followed:
(a) users would be organized into Barangay Water Users Associations
(BWUA) and properly registered prior to any starting of well and
spring construction or rehabilitation;



- 22 -
(b)  records and logs of existing wells near each site would be
evaluated prior to construction in order to indicate possible
aquifer conditions;
(c)  wells and springs would be located at least 300 m apart;
(d)  wells and springs would be situated at least 30 m from any source
of contamination;
(e)  unless salt water is a problem, wells would be at least 6 m deep
to avoid contamination;
(f)  pump-bases would be at least 50 cm above the highest flood level;
(g)  aquifers would be properly screened; and
(h)  springs would be developed in preference to wells if:
(i) estimated cost of development is less than P 30,000;
(ii) no pump is required; and
(iii) flow exceeds 5 gallons per minute.
3.21      The design and construction standards followed would be the same as
agreed for the Philippine Rural Infrastructure Project (Credit 790-PH). Hand
pumps suitable for installation in 4" casing would be used. Recoverable 6"
drive pipes and 4" well casing in 20' lengths would be used with engine driven
rigs. The manual rigs would have to use 4" drive pipe in 10' lengths which
would be left in the hole as permanent casing. Where there is no need for
drive pipes, 4" casing in standard 20' lengths would be used. Wirewound
screens would be installed which could be attached to, or telescoped into a
4", casing.  The top 20 feet of the annular space between casing and hole
would be filled with cement grout wherever possible. In holes with alter-
nating sandstone and shale, installation of one short screen might not produce
water as efficiently as a longer section of slotted casing. In such cases,
steel pipes would be used which would be slotted on a machine owned by MPW in
Manila and would not be torch cut or hand cut on the job. PVC casings would
be tried and evaluated in about 25% of the wells, and if successful, their use
would be expanded.
Schistosomiasis Control
3.22      The project would expand the non-engineering aspects of the
schistosomiasis control program presently operating in Leyte (Loan 1414-PH)
into the Samar area. Under the Leyte project, the program consists of chemo-
therapy, health education and mollusciding, combined with engineering measures
such as construction of drains, foot bridges, toilets and wells. The regional
administrative capacity of the Schlstosomiasis Control and Research Service
(SCRS) would be strengthened by establishing a functionally autonomous
regional headquarters in Leyte. Lazge-scale examination of about 80,000
people and chemotherapy of an estimated 41,00 people would be undertaken in



- 21 -
municipalities with high schistosomiasis incidences. Praziquantel, a new
schistosomicide Twiich appears suitable for large-scale therapy, would be used,
provided that the result of present trials being conducted in Leyte are
successful.  Niridazole, which is unsuitable for large-scale treatment, would
be given to patients presenting ther.seLves at clinics for treatment.
Malacological mapping would be undetta-en to define endemic areas more
precisely. Parasitological surveys would be conducted, though initially
concentrated on schoolchildren. Ho&evar, in heavily infected communities, all
persons needing treatment would be :deatified. Agro-engineering measures
would not be included and snail control measures would be restricted to a few
intensively infected areas within project irrigation systems.
3.23      The project would construct and equip three field laboratories
to be used for stool examinations, ialacology, data analysis and clinical
examinations. The laboratories would also serve as operational bases for
case-finding and large-scale chemotherapy. Vehicles would be provided for
the malacological and treatment tearls.
Catubig Valley Development Study
3.24      The project would provide for preparation of a detailed feasibility
study of the Catubig valley in Northern Samar in which irrigation, drainage,
flood control, rainfed agriculture, health services and transportation
development would be considered in a comprehensive plan. The study would be
carried out in two phases. The first phase, which would require about six
months, would review the agricultural activity in the valley, identify
problems and constraints on its agricultural development, and evaluate
different development options in terms of technical, economic and financial
feasibility. After this phase, over a period of two months, the Government
would review the findings, decide whether to implement a development plan and
conduct the next phase. The second phase would involve further collection of
data and would concentrate on detailed planning, design, costing, and
preparing an implementation schedule for the chosen development option. The
latter phase is expected to take about one year. The project would provide
for surveys, mapping, field investigations and consulting services. The terms
of reference for consulting services have already been prepared and are accep-
table to the Bank. Assurances were obtained that consultants satisfactory
to the Bank would be engaged to assist with the studies under terms and condi-
tions agreed with the Bank. The Samar Integrated Rural Development Project
Office (SIRDPO) would be responsible for the overall supervision and coordi-
nation of the study with support personnel from relevant Government agencies
and departments. The study would begin in early 1980 and is expected to be
completed by end-1981.
Cost Estimates
3.25      Total project costs are estimated at US$45.0 million, of which
US$26.0 million or 58% is foreign exchange. Project costs are based on
detailed engineering quantity estimates for roads, ports and 800 ha of
irrigation, feasibility grade quantity estimates for the rest, and unit prices
prevailing in Bank-assisted projects adjusted to end-1979 and to conditions
prevailing in the province of Samar. Unit prices for equipment, materials and
supplies are based on recent quotations received by the agencies responsible



1 24 -
for thE- variolus pro2ec- c.Dmponents, The Government exempts its various
dFpartments and agencies from paying taxes or duties for equipment, materials
anid services procured un<et foreign-assisted projects, so all costs exclude
such taxes. Line agencies' costs for design and construction supervision are
included under engineering. A physical contingency of 10% was used for roads
and ports where the engineering is advanced. In the case of irrigation, where
about 60% of the component is based on preliminary engineering, a 15% factor
was used.  For water supply, where detailed lists of equipment and materials
(the major portion of the cost) were prepared on the basis of conservative
estimates of well depths, a 10% contingency has been used. Costs due to
expected price increases over the implementation period amount to about 23% of
the total base cost plus physical contingencies, assuming the following annual
inflation rates for civil works, equipment and services:

Financing
3.27      The proposed loan of US$27.0 million would finance the full foreign
exchange cost of the project and cover 60% of the total project costs. The
Government would provide the remaining P 133.2 million (US$18.0 million)
to the various line agencies from annual budget appropriations. Each imple-
menting agency would maintain a separate account for the project and would
submit budget requests to the Project Director for approval. The Project
Director would forward approved requests to the Minister of the Budget,
who would disburse all project funds directly to the implementing agencies
in accordance with normal Government procedures, which are satisfactory to
ensure the continuous and timely flow of project funds.
Procurement
3.28      Equipment, vehicles, spare parts and supplies for roads, irri-
gation systems, and water supply wells, costing about US$6.8 million, would
be procured after international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
Guidelines. A preference limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported
goods, or the customs duty, whichever is lower would be extended to local
manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Local procurement practices are
appropriate for off-the-shelf items costing less than US$10,000 each because
the advantages of international competitive bidding would be clearly out-
weighed by the administrative costs involved. The total cost of such items
for all components of the project would not exceed US$200,000. Bank staff
have reviewed local procedures and they are acceptable. There is adequate
competition and foreign firms can participate. A list of equipment require-
ments is given in Annex 1. NIA would handle the procurement of vehicles,
equipment and supplies for the communal irrigation systems, schistosomiasis
control, and the Catubig valley development study. MPW would procure the
vehicles, drilling equipment and materials required for the contruction of
water supply wells.
3.29      Construction of the national roads totaling about US$17.5 million
(broken into about 4 packages), would be done by contract under inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. The
irrigation component of about US$2.5 million and the water supply component
of about US$2.4 million are not suitable for international competitive
bidding since the works are widely scattered and small in size. Therefore,
these would be carried out by contract under competitive bidding in
accordance with local procedures. Bank staff have reviewed the local
procedures and they are acceptable. There is potentially adequate com-
petition and foreign firms can participate. However, in order to strengthen
MPW's implementation capability and facilitate drilling of wells in
relatively inaccessible areas not attractive to contractors, 50% of the
wells would be carried out by force account, amounting to about
US$0.4 million.



- 28 -
Disbursements
5.30      Disbursements would be made at a rate of 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of imported equipment and materials or 100% of the ex-factory
price of locally manufactured equipment for procurement under international
competitive bidding, and 65% for imported equipment procured under local
procedures. Disbursement of civil works would be 50% of certified monthly
progress payments or expenditures for contract work. Disbursements for force
account work by MPW would be made against certificates of expenditures, the
documentation for which would not be submitted to the Bank for review, but
would be retained by the borrower and made available for inspection by the
Bank's supervision mission. The regional offices of MPW have the staffing and
institutional capability to provide such documentation in a satisfactory
manner (Annex 3). For costs of consultant services and overseas training
disbursements, would be at a rate of 100% of total costs.
3.31      Disbursement of the Bank loan would be against import documentation,
contracts and certif..ed records of payment or expenditure. It is expected
that disbursements would be completed by June 30, 1985, approximately
six months after completion of construction. An estimated schedule of ex-
penditure, a semiannual disbursement schedule, and a proposed allocation of
credit proceeds are given in Annex 1.
Accounts and Audit
3.32      The MPH, MPW, NIA, and MOH are Government agencies and their
accounts are audited annually by the Government's Commission on Audit.
Assurances were obtained that these agencies would maintain separate accounts
for the project and that after audit by the Commission on Audit, the project
accounts, together with the auditor's comments, would be sent to the Bank
within six months of the close of each financial year.
Environmental Effects
3.33      The project is not expected to have any adverse effect on the
environment. The project would have a beneficial effect on the health of
people in Samar through the provision of wells and springs, and the control of
schistosomiasis.

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Prolect Management
4.01      Implementation of the project would require coordination between
a number of national ministries and line agencies. These are the Ministries
of Public Highways (MPH), Health (MOH) and Public Works (MPW) the Bureau of
Community Development (BCD), the Philippines Port Authority (PPA), the
National Irrigation Administration (NIA) and the Farm Systems Development
Corporation (FSDC). Responsibility for coordinating the activities of these
organizations and for implementing the project at the national level would
rest with the Project Director of the Samar Integrated Rural Development
Project Office (SIRDPO). The post of Project Director and the SIRDPO were
established by Presidential Decree No. 1048 of November 15, 1976. The SIRDPO
would also service the Australian-financed project and the Project Director's
authority would extend over both the Australian and Bank-assisted projects.
The Project Director would report directly to the Cabinet Coordinator
appointed under PD 1048, who is the Minister of Local Government and Community
Development and the member of the National Committee on Integrated Area
Development (NACIAD) allocated prime responsibility for overseeing the
project. The Director would have a small technical and management staff
including a monitoring unit to assess the physical progress of the various
project components (Figure 4.1). The Government has appointed a
well-qualified individual to the post of Project Director and an assurance was
obtained that the Bank would be afforded an opportunity to comment on any new
appointment to the post during the period of project implementation.
4.02      The Project Director would be responsible for approving detailed
annual budgets and work programs for project activities prepared by the parti-
cipating ministries and agencies. To perform this function, he would be
chairman of a Steering Committee composed of senior officers from each of the
ministries and agencies involved in the project as well as a representative
from the Ministry of the Budget. The Committee members would be empowered to
speak for their respective organizations as far as the project is concerned.
The Government has appointed the Steering Committee for the project. An
assurance has been obtained that each ministry and agency would prepare an
annual budget and work program for its part in the project and submit them to
the Steering Committee for approval at least three months in advance of each
fiscal year. The Project Director would forward a copy of the annual budgets
and work programs to the Bank for information as an aid to project
supervision.
Regional Organization
4.03      Since all-Ministries and agencies are organized on a regional basis
the senior officers of the various line agencies with the most direct
authority over the project would be the Regional Directors of Region 8, head-
quartered in Tacloban City in Leyte. To ensure coordination of activities at
the regional level and a quick channel of communication with the Steering
Committee the Government has established a Regional Advisory Committee. The



- 30 -
Committee would include, in addition to all the Regional Directors concerned,
the three Provincial Covernors and the Regional Director of the National
Economic Development Authority (NEDA). The Project Director would be Chairman
of the Committee.
Provincial Organization
4.04      In each of the three provinces of Samar the Government has estab-
lished a Provincial Advisory Committee, consisting of the provincial heads of
each line agency and the Provincial Governor. The Provincial Project Officer
would represent the SIRDPO and would be chairman of the Committee. The
Provincial Committees, being closest to implementation in the field, would
have the greatest degree of day-to-day responsibility for improvement of
project coordination.
Agencv Responsibilities
4.05      The Bureau if Construction and Maintenance of the Ministry of Public
Highways working through the Regional Director would be responsible for
improvement and rehabilitation of the national highways in Eastern Samar. The
MPH has prepared detailed designs and is completing final engineering specifi-
cations and tender documents, it would award contracts and supervise construc-
tion. Consultant assistance would be provided as required. No provisions are
made under the project for maintenance of the national highways in Eastern
Samar, as the maintenance requirements have been provided for under the
Bank-assisted Fourth Highway Project, (Loan 1661-PH).
4.06      The Harbor's Division of the MPW would be responsible for prepara-
tion of the detailed designs, final engineering specifications and tender
documents and award of contracts and supervision of construction of
Catbalogan port. The PPA would be responsible for operation and maintenance
of the port after completion of rehabilitation.
4.07      'he Division of Wells and Springs of MPW would be responsible for
implemen'-.ng the water supply component of the project.  The MPW has entered
into a memorandum of agreement with the BCD, by which the BCD would organize
the beneficiaries of a well into a Barangay Water Users' Association (BWUA),
who would donate the land for the well and access together with labor during
construction and would agree to set aside in a special account P 12/family/
year towards maintenance costs of the well. The BCD has agreed to get the
BWUAs set up one year ahead of the drilling program, to ensure that the
pcople are genuinely interested in the well and look forward to having one.
i# ~iwould train one or two members of the BWUA in minor maintenance practices
for the well and pump. MPW would also set up under the project mobile main-
tenance teams, supported by small provincial workshops, which would routinely
inspect all wells on a regular schedule and would also be available for
emergency repairs as needed. The cost of such maintenance in terms of man-
power, transport and materials and spares is estimated at P 220/well/annum.



- 31 -
4.08      The Ministry of Health, through the Schistosomiasis Control and
Research Service (SCRS), would be responsible for the schistomiasis component
of the project. All SCRS operations would be directed from a regional head-
quarters in Leyte. In order to effect this, SCRS in Manila has agreed to
decentralize its services and to create a strengthened regional unit in
Leyte, which would operate the ongoing Leyte programs (Loan 1414-PH) and the
proposed new program for Samar. The regional unit would be responsible for
working with all other involved agencies at the regional and provincial
levels, while the Director of SCRS in Manila would represent MOH on the
Steering Committee.
4.09      The NIA Regional Office in Tacloban would be responsible for
implementation of the engineering aspects of the communal irrigation
component, working through the District Engineers located in Northern and
Western Samar. The FSDC office in Leyte would be responsible for organizing
the required ISAs in each of the identified systems, getting them registered
and then providing them with leadership and support until the ISAs learn to
operate and maintain the systems adequately. FSDC would assign one Institu-
tional Officer (IO) per system, roughly equivalent to one IO per 70 farmers,
who would remain assigned to the system for the first five years after
completion of construction. The provincial offices of FSDC would monitor the
operation, maintenance and agricultural production of the systems for a
minimum period of five years after completion of construction. Communal
irrigation systems in Samar have always failed due to the farmers' inability
to operate and maintain the systems. It is hoped that by providing heavy FSDC
coverage in the first five years of operations, difficulties encountered in
the past can be avoided.
Consultancy Services and Technical Assistance
4.10      The project would provide for consulting services to assist MPH in
construction supervision. Provision would also be made for consultants to
assist SIRDPO to investigate the feasibility and if possible propose a
development plan for the Catubig valley. It is estimated that about
84 man-months of consulting services would be required for the road component
and 55 man-months for the Catubig studies at an average overall cost of
US$10,000 per man-month consisting of a billing rate (including home-office
overhead) of US$8,000 per man-month, international travel expenses of US$500
per man-month, and local expenses of US$1,500 per man-month. A further 90
man-months of consultant services from local associates of the expatriate
firms would be provided for the Catubig studies at an average cost of US$2,500
per man-month.

5~ BENEFITS. JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
National Roads
5.01      Agricultural p-oductivity in Eastern Samar has not increased signi-
ficantly in the past since most of the roads are impassable for a large part
of the year, transport costs are high, and ability to get to markets is
uncertain.  The proposed improvement of national roads would provide a
reliable and more economical transport system to major agricultural areas and
population centers of Eastern Samar. The optimum first phase of improvement
would be the construction of permanent bridges, raising of some road sections
to prevent flooding due to heavy rains and high tides, and improvement of the
surface to gravel standards0 The improved roads would lower transport costs
for farmers, enable better access to extension services and increase reliabi-
lity of market access which would provide farmers with opportunities to
increase production. T% addition, the improved roads would provide rural
inhabitants with bette. access to health and education facilities.
5.02      The coastal national road, stretching from Oras in the north to
Guiuan in the south, runs through a relatively narrow strip of land between
mountains to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The mountain areas
are covered with forest and contain mineral resources, while the river valleys
and coastal areas grow predominantly rice and coconuts. The Wright-Taft
national road, connecting the typhoon prone east coast to the relatively
sheltered west coast of Samar, passes through forest-land and predominantly
rice growing areas. While rice is grown all over the province, the north
enjoys a rice surplus which is transported to (a) the rice-deficit south
through the major market center of Borongan, and (b) the rice-deficit area of
Catbalogan in lWestern Samar by the Wright-Taft road. Coconuts are grown all
along the coast and most of the copra production is transported to the
major market center and port of Borongan for export to other islands. Copra
is also exported through the port of Guiuan in the south while some is
transported to the port of Catbalogan on the western coast of Samar.
About 20,000 ha of rice, 80,000 ha of coconut and some abaca and corn
lie within the influence area of these roads. These areas produce about
20,000 tons of paddy and 72,000 tons of copra.
5e03      Eastern Samar has about 150,000 ha of commercial forest and major
forest logging operations are located near Dolores and San Julian, and there
is a lumber mill in Borongan. Commercial fishing, about 23,000 tons annually,
is undertaken largely in the Guiuan, Borongan, and Oras bays. The province is
estimated to have about 11 million tons of metallic ore reserves of copper,
zinc, iron and nickel. Four firms are presently undertaking exploration
activities while one is mining copper near Sulat. Other mining activities
include the extraction of sand, gravel and coral rocks.
5.04      The national roads serve a population of about 213,000 whose average
per capita income ranges from P 265 (US$35) near Guiuan in the south to
about p 550 (US$75) near Borongan in the center. About 77% of the labor



- 33 -
force is employed in farming and fishing, 5% in manufacturing, 10% in
services, 3% in commerce, and the rest in construction, transportation and
other sectors. Traffic on these roads ranges from an average of about
95 vehicles per day (vpd) on the Taft-Wright section to about 200 vehicles per
day (vpd) on the Taft-Borongan section.
5.05      Traffic Forecast.  Existing traffic levels were estimated by field
traffic surveys conducted by MPH in December 1978. Reliable traffic data for
periods before 1978 are not available. Annual traffic growth rates anti-
cipated over the future up to the year 2,000 vary from an average of about
2.7% near Guiuan in the south to about 3.4% near Borongan in the center (Annex
2, Table 1).  Excluding the impact of the project, agricultural  r(oduction is
expected to grow at an annual rate of 3% largely due to the implementation of
the National Extension Project (Loan 1626-PH) and the increased efforts of the
Philippines Coconut Authority. The improved roads would generate an increase
in nonagricultural traffic of about 40%. The incremental agricultural pro-
duction generated due to road improvement is expected to be 10% of the normal
agricultural production growth without the project.
Economic Analysis
5.06      Benefits.  Benefits from the proposed improvement of the roads were
determined as the difference in road user costs in end-1979 values exclu-
ding taxes, with and without the project, for nonagricultural traffic plus
value of net incremental production attributable to road improvement.
Average vehicle operating costs and savings were assessed by MPH for
different types of vehicles and different sections of the road using com-
puter simulation (Annex 2, Table 2). Savings on the improved roads range
between 31% and 49% taking into account traffic density, speed and side
friction. Savings in passenger time were quantified on the basis of P 5.9/hr
for a car, P 5.5/hr for jeepneys, and P 20.7/hr for buses. If passengers'
time is included, they are slightly higher savings of 35% to 53%. Incremen-
tal paddy production has been valued at P 1,150/ton and incremental copra
production at P 2,300/ton. For the econQmic analysis, the local portion of
these benefits (40% of total) were multiplied by the standard conversion
factor of 0.82 to convert them to border prices.
5.07      Investment.  The economic cost of improving the roads was derived
by excluding taxes and price contingencies but including physical contin-
gencies. Unskilled labor has been priced at P 3.0 per day/l and local con-
/1  Since Eastern Samar is an extremely depressed area, P 3.0 per man-day has
been used instead of the average national shadow wage rate for rural areas
of P 3.7/man-day.



- 34 -
struction costs were multiplied by the conversion factor for construction of
0.827 to express them in border prices. The total economic cost expressed in
end-1979 values, amounts to US$13.7 million, equivalent to about E 444,600
(US$60,100) per km; ranging from P 648,000 (US$87,500) per km on the
Taft-Oras section to P 224,000 (US$30,200) per km on the Buenavista-Guiuan
Section.
5.08      Economic Rate of Return.  Using the foregoing economic costs and
benefits and a service life of 20 years for the investment, the economic
rate of return is 14% (Annex 2, Table 3). The improved roads would also pro-
vide rural inhabitants with better access to health and education facilities
as well as to off-farm employment in nearby towns during off-season months.
5.09      Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity of the rate of return was tested
to variations in construction costs, traffic growth rates, producer surplus,
and a combination of these variations (Table 5.1). A 10% increase in con-
struction costs and a 20% decrease in nonagricultural traffic growth rates
would have the combined effect of dropping the rate of return by 3%. A 50%
drop in the producer surplus would drop the rate of return by 2%. In the
worst case, a 10% increase in construction cost in addition to a 50% drop in
producer surplus would drop the rate of return to 10%.

5.10      Risks.  No problems in implementation are expected since MPH has
considerable experience in the construction of such roads. MPH would be
assisted by consultants in the supervision of construction.
Catbalogan Port
5.11      The port of Catbalogan ranks low on PPA's list of priority ports
for development, primarily because of the relatively low level of traffic it
handles compared to other ports. However, from the point of view of the



- 35 -
development of Samar, rehabilitation of this port is of considerable
significance. It is important for inter-regional travel, import of staple
foods, construction material and oil products, and export and marketing of
agricultural products. The dilapidated condition of the port makes the
handling of present traffic difficult and unsafe. The continuing
deterioration of the facilities would further reduce handling capacity of
the port, causing hardship and danger to the travelling population and extra
cost to the economy of the surrounding areas.
5.12      Traffic Forecast.  The port, located at the center of the western
coastline, is the largest port in Samar and serves the relatively highly
populated province of Western Samar. It is also strategically located close
to the western end of the highway, connecting the typhoon prone eastern coast
of Samar to the relatively sheltered western coast, along which copra and
forestry products are transported for export to other islands through
Catbalogan. Almost all the port's traffic is interisland, to Cebu and
Manila, and it does not handle any foreign traffic. All traffic between
Catbalogan and Tacloban, a distance of about 110 km, travels by the
Philippine-Japan highway constructed in the early seventies.
5.13      During the year 1978, the port handled about 71,000 tons of cargo
and about 144,000 passengers. Reliable data on traffic handled before 1978
is not available since PPA took over operation of the port in mid-1977.
However, the National Census and Statistics Office (NCSO) has estimated the
1975 traffic to be 55,000 tons and the National Maritime Industry (MARINA)
at about 48,000 tons. These figures, if taken seriously, would represent a
past growth in traffic of about 10% per annum. Despite the unreliability
of past traffic data, it is some indication that traffic has been increasing
modestly over the past three years.
5.14      About 75% of the cargo handled was inward and the rest outward to
Cebu and Manila. The largest groups of imports was cement and construction
material, oil products, consumer goods, and general cargo. The oil products
cement, construction materials and metal products are used primarily by the
construction, forest, and mining industry in Western Samar. The major out-
ward agricultural cargo is copra and corn which are grown in the province.
A detailed commodity breakdown for 1978 and the forecast up to 1995 is
presented in Annex 2, Table 4. Total traffic is expected to grow from
70,600 tons in 1978 to about 106,500 tons in 1990 and 128,000 tons in 1995,
representing an annual growth rate of 3.5% from 1978 to 1990 and a mar-
ginally higher rate later. Import cargo projections were based on expected
population growth of about 1.5%, per capita income growth of about 2%, and a
growth of about 5% in private forestry operations. Export projections were
based on expected annual growth in copra production of about 1.3% and corn
production of about 1.7%. Passenger traffic, expected to grow at an annual
rate of 3%, is based on population and income growth projections for the
area.
5.15      The only potential cause for a decrease of Catbalogan's traffic
would be the completion of a modern ferry link between Northern Samar and the
southern tip of Luzon island by 1985. Catbalogan would then be linked to
Manila, except for the 30 km ferry crossing, by a cement-concrete road, for



- 36 -
a total distance of about 900 km. However, this development would not cause
any significant diversion of the port's traffic since (a) for such long
distances, ship transport would be more competitive than road, and (b) the
non-bulk nature of cargo (passenger accompanied by sacks, animals, etc.)
would be more convenient for transport by sea.
Economic Analysis
5.16      Benefits.  Engineering inspection of the port facilities has shown
that they have deteriorated considerably and that, if no remedial measures
were taken, they would become useless and unsafe by about 1985. Under such
circumstances, the cargo and passenger traffic would have to travel to the
port of Tacloban, about 110 km away, which handles ships to Manila and Cebu.
Benefits have been expressed in terms of the amount users of the port would be
willing to pay for its rehabilitation. Since it was not possible to measure
the willingness to pay iirectly, the cost of transport from Catbalogan to
Tacloban was taken as a minimum measure of the users' willingness to pay,
ignoring the possibility that the users would be willing to pay more for the
convenience of a nearby port. The present cost of transport between
Catbalogan and Tacloban, expressed in end-1979 values, is P 40/ton and about
P 6.0/passenger. These benefits were multiplied by the standard conversion
factor of 0.82 to convert them to border prices. Since induced traffic is not
expected to be substantial, benefits from such traffic have been ignored.
5.17      Investment.  The optimum first phase of improvement would be the
rehabilitation of the port so as to maintain its present "physical" capacity,
without any significant expansion. The economic cost of rehabilitation
includes physical contingencies but excludes taxes and price contingencies.
Local construction costs were multiplied by the conversion factor for
construction of 0.827. The total economic cost of rehabilitation, expressed
in end-1979 values, is P 13.0 million (US$1.75 million). It is estimated
that the annual incremental investment in maintenance would be P 230,000
(US$0.03 million).
5.18      Economic Rate of Return.  Using the earlier stated economic costs
and benefits and a life of 20 years, the rate of return is 19% (Annex 2,
Table 5).
5.19      Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity of the rate of return was tested
to variations in construction costs, timing of obsolescence of present port
facilities, traffic growth rates, users' willingness to pay, and a combination
of these variations (Table 5.2). A 10% increase in construction costs and a
20% decrease in expected traffic growth rates would each reduce the rate of
return to 18%. Combining both these alternatives decreases the rate of return
to 17%. A slower deterioration and breakdown of port facilities two years
later than expected reduces the rate of return to 18%.

5.20      Risks.  No problems in implementation are expected since the works
are standard and MPW has considerable experience in constructing such a port.
Irrigation
5.21      The proposed communal irrigation systems would increase yields on
2,000 ha currently dependent on rainfed cultivation by providing irrigation.
Approximately 1,000 farm families and 500 landless laborer's families, a total
of 1,500 would benefit directly from increased production and employment. The
component would create a demand for an additional 136,000 man-days of farm
labor per year, equivalent to some 560 full-time jobs. About 95% of the bene-
ficiaries would lie in the target group. The component would meet the Govern-
ment's objective of increased food production and development of the depressed
Samar provinces at a capital cost of about US$2,600 per benefited farm family.
At full agricultural development, this component would result in an incremen-
tal yearly paddy production of about 3,830 tons with an export value of about
US$0.77 million at the forecast world market prices.
5.22      Cropping Pattern.  In the project systems the wet-season rainfed
rice crop starts in September/October and harvesting takes place in March/
April. No dry season crop is grown. Cultivation is by animal drawn imple-
ments. Farmers use no fertilizer, HYV seeds, insecticides or herbicides.
Crops are manually harvested and threshed and grain is sun-dried on mats,
roads, drying floors and suitable surfaces, and stored in the house for home
consumption, seed or sale. In the absence of the project, there would be
no significant change in the cropping patterns. However, with the project
farmers would grow only irrigated rice in the systems. With the project, the
Palali system is expected to have a cropping intensity of about 160%, and the
Calapi system and the as yet unidentified systems an intensity of about 130%.



- 38 -
5.23      Yields, Development Period and Production.  With the project,
improved water control and adequate supply of extension advice through
Institutional Officers of FSDC, paddy yields are expected to increase by 1.2
ton/ha over an eight year period after completion of construction of the
systems (i.e. 11 years after start of project, in 1990).  Without the project,
paddy yields are expected to increase by about 0.2 ton/ha over the same
period. This would mean an incremental 1.0 ton/ha yield increase at full
development.  As a result of the project production would increase from about
2,040 tons of paddy to an estimated 5,870 tons at full development (Annex 2,
Table 6).
5.24      Market Prospects and Prices for Rice.  A major Government objective
is to increase rice production as a means of raising the incomes of small
farmers and of attaining national self-sufficiency in food grains. After
experiencing substantial deficits in the early 1970s, rice production grew
by 5% p.a. during crop aears 1974-1977 and the Philippines was able to provide
for consumption solely from domestic production during the crop years 1975-77.
In 1977 the Government exported 190,000 tons and in 1978 about 250,000 tons
of rice to Indonesia and Malaysia. The good performance in the past three
years has been due mainly to an increase in yields brought about by favorable
weather, with the 1977 production being 235,000 tons above the long-term
trend. With the continued growth of population and incomes, the demand for
rice is expected to rise by about 3.0% annually. Based on a projected growth
of 3.7% in production and under average weather conditions, the Philippines is
expected to achieve sustained selfsufficiency by 1982 and to have a surplus of
between 350,000 and 375,000 tons by 1990. Incremental rice production from
the project would be sold in Western Samar, which is a rice-deficit area.
5.25      Since 1957 the Government has set an annual farm-gate support price
for paddy to encourage production and allow some purchases of paddy by
Government to build stabilization stocks. Responsibility for operating the
system through purchases in the market is vested in a statutory body, the
National Grains Authority (NGA). Through 1972, the farm-gate support price
for paddy and the domestic consumer price for rice kept pace with changes in
the world market price for rice. Between 1972 and 1975, to keep domestic
prices down in the face of record high world market prices for rice, the
Government subsidized consumers by maintaining a low official ceiling price
for rice and a correspondingly low farm-gate price for paddy by sales of
imported rice on the domestic market below cost. Since 1975, the official
support price and the import parity prices have been practically the same.
The support price for paddy, almost constant through 1977 and 1978 at about
P 1,100/ton (US$149/ton), was increased in early 1979 to E 1,260/ton (US$170/
ton) to compensate farmers for increased production costs.
5.26      According to the Bank's commodity price forecasts, the world market
price of Thai 5% broken rice is expected to rise (in constant end-1979
prices) from US$369/ton f.o.b. Bangkok in 1979 to US$469/ton in 1990. The
quality of rice likely to be exported by the Philippines in the end-1980s is
25-35% broken, which historically trades at a 30% discount from the price of
5% broken rice. On this basis the world market price of Thai 25-35% broken is
expected to rise from US$258/ton in 1978 to US$328/ton in 1990. The economic

and financial paddy farm-gate price calculations, assuming that incremental
paddy production of the country would be exported, have been shown in Annex 2,
Table 7.
Economic Analysis
5.27      Benefits.  Input assumptions, production costs, and labor require-
ments per ha have been shown in Annex 2, Tables 8 and 9. Local production
costs were multiplied by the standard conversion factor of 0.82 to convert
them to border prices. As a result of the project, annual demand for labor
would increase from 138,750 man-days to 275,000 man-days at full development.
The labor was valued at a shadow wage rate of P 3.0/man-day (based on
experience in other comparable Bank-assisted irrigation projects in the
Philippines); by comparison the peak season wage rate is P 7.0/man-day. The
net value of production for the component after costing labor has been
calculated in Annex 2, Table 10.
5.28      Investment Costs.  The economic cost of construction was calculated
by excluding taxes and price contingencies but including physical contin-
gencies. Local constructions costs were multiplied by the conversion factor
for construction of 0.827 to convert them to border prices. The total
economic cost for the component, expressed in end-1979 values, is P 16.0 mil-
lion (US$2.2 million), averaging to about P 8,000 (US$1,080) per ha. The per
ha cost would be P 7,100 (US$960) for the Palali system P 7,700 (US$1,040) for
the Calapi system, and P 8,475 (US$1,145) for the rest. The annual
incremental O&M cost per ha is expected to be P 75 (US$10).
5.29      Economic Rate of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions and dis-
counting costs and benefits over a 40-year evaluation period, the economic
rate of return is 16% (Annex 2, Table 13). The Palali system is expected to
have a rate of return of 20%, the Calapi system, 17% and the rest, 13%. The
rates of return for Palali and Calapi systems are based on detailed appraisal
while the rest of the component would have to be economically justified in
detail before implementation.
5.30      Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity of the economic rate of return
was tested to cost overruns, reduction in expected yields, rice market prices,
future cropping intensities and delays in reaching full development
(Table 5.3). The rate of return is most sensitive to yields, dropping to 11%
for the component due to a 10% decrease in expected yields. This higher-than-
normal sensitivity is due to the relatively low projected yields. A 10%
decrease in projected yields would be equivalent to a 22% decrease in incre-
mental yields due to the project. The probability of a 10% drop from the
modest projected yields is low.

5.31      Risks.  No problems in implementation of construction are
anticipated as NIA has ample experience with projects of similar scope. The
element of risk for the irrigation component concerns: (a) the capacity of
Irrigation Service Associations to take over responsibility for maintaining
these systems to ensure the efficient use of irrigation water. This risk has
been minimized by ensuring that FSDC would supervise the maintenance of the
systems and monitor the performance of the associations for five years after
completion of construction; (b) the availability of extension services, and
adoption of better crop practices. This risk has been taken into account by
the expectation of lower average rice yields of 2.2 ton/ha compared to 4.1
ton/ha in other Bank-assisted irrigation projects in the Philippines.
Moreover, the provinces of Northern and Western Samar fall under the scope of
the National Extension Project (Loan 1626-PH) for improvement of agricultural
extension services.
5.32      Farm Incomes.  Farm budgets were prepared for the Palali and Calapi
systems for representative farm sizes and by types of tenure (Annex 2, Tables
12 and 13). Almost 95% of the farm families in Palali and Calapi are pre-
sently below the Bank's estimated per capita absolute poverty level of US$200
(end-i979 prices). Presently, per capita incomes range from a low of US$30
for a leaseholder farm in the Calapi system to a maximum of US$140 for a
5.0 ha owner-operated farm in the Palali system. These per capita incomes
range from 5 to 23% of the 1979 per capita GNP of US$600 for the country. At
full development in 1990, the projected per capita incomes would range from a
low of US$70 for a 1.0 ha leaseholder farm in the Calapi system to a maximum
of US$450 for 5.0 ha owner-operated farm in the Palali system. These per
capita incomes would range from 7 to 46% of the 1990 projected per capita GNP
of US$975 for the country. The comparison indicates that the project would
help to narrow the income gap between the project area and other parts of the
country, and between urban and rural areas.

5.33      Cost and Rent Recovery.  The NIA would construct the irrigation
works and charge the ISA of each system. NIA's present terms of repayment for
communal systems treat 10% of the capital cost as a grant; 70% as an interest
free loan and 20% as a loan with an annual interest of 6%. The loan is repay-
able in 25 years, including a grace period of 4-1/2 years. The average cost
of construction is US$1,260/ha for the component, consisting of US$1,100/ha
for Palali, US$1,200/ha for Calapi, and US$1,350/ha for the unidentified
systems.
5.34      Based on the above charges, the rent recovery and cost recovery
indices were calculated for different farm sizes and tenure. Since the
indices vary negligibly with the size of the farm, they have been presented
for owner-operator and leaseholder operated 1.0 ha farms in Annex 2, Table 14.
The recovery charge would average about P 300 (US$40) per hectare. The
incremental rent recovery index ranges from 18% for an owner-operator in
Palali to 40% for a leaseholder on an unidentified system. The average incre-
mental rent recovery index of 30% is a little higher than in other Bank-
assisted irrigation projects in the Philippines due to the small incremental
yields expected. However, the cost recovery index of 15% is lower than that
in other projects because the terms for repayment do not compensate for
inflation in contrast to noncommunal systems where the repayment is denomi-
nated in terms of kg of paddy per hectare. In view of the low income
levels of the beneficiaries, the proposed level of repayment is acceptable.
No "betterment" taxes or other Government levies are envisaged for the areas.
Water Supply
5.35      The project would provide about 2,300 village wells and 300 springs,
thereby improving the availability and quality of water for about 650,000
rural inhabitants. The benefits from a safe and reliable water supply would
arise from a reduction in water-borne diseases and the elimination of a
considerable amount of unproductive time and effort devoted to hauling water
over long distances. These benefits have not been quantified but are judged
to justify the small per capita investment of about US$14. The villagers
would contribute about 20% of the capital cost in the form of voluntary labor,
local materials and land. The villagers would, specifically, donate land for
access roads and location of wells, build access roads, fencing and provide
unskilled labor for construction and maintenance of the wells. In addition,
each household would contribute P 1.0 per month towards a fund to help
maintain the wells and springs. Assuming 50 families per well, the total
annual contribution per well would amount to P 600, which would cover the cost
of parts, skilled labor and MPW's annual inspection and servicing expenses.
Schistosomiasis Control
5.36      The component would provide chemotherapy treatment for about 41,000
people in Samar, thus improving their health and productive capacity. The
malacological and parasitological surveys, would lay the groundwork for the
identification and possible implementation of a larger schistosomiasis control
program, which would benefit a considerably larger number of schistosomiasis-
affected people.



- 42 -
Weighted Economic Rate of Return
5.37      The average rate of return for the rural roads component, the base
cost of which is US$19.8 million, is 14%. The port component, with an
investment of US$2.1 million, has a rate of return of 19%. The rate of
return for the irrigation component is 16% for an investment of US$2.6 mil-
lion. The weighted economic rate of return for these three components, which
account for 67% of the total project costs, is 15%. Benefits from the water
supply, and schistosomiasis control components have not been quantified.
Distribution of Benefits
5.38       The main beneficiaries of transport cost reductions on the road
would be the rural communities in the area of influence of the roads. Given
the competitiveness of the transport industry, a significant part of the road-
user savings can be expected to accrue to the rural communities in the form
of reductions, or at least, slower increases in transport charges. In addi-
tion, the increased agricultural production induced by the roads would benefit
farmers by increasing their incomes. Assuming that half of the cost
reductions from buses and jeepneys are passed onto the rural communities,
about 60% of the total benefits from the road would accrue to the poorer
section of the rural communities, almost all of whom have incomes below the
absolute poverty level. The remaining 40% of the benefits would be shared
by commercial transporters, middlemen, and owners of cars.
5.39       In the case of Catbalogan port, assuming that only half the savings
in transport of goods and all the savings in transport of passengers is passed
on to the producers and consumers, about 60% of the benefits of the port would
accrue to the rural community, almost all of whom have incomes below the
absolute poverty level. The remaining 40% of the benefits would accrue to
transporters and middlemen. For the irrigation component, about 85% of the
benefits would accrue to farm families below the poverty level.
5.40      For the road, port and irrigation components, which represent about
67% of the total project cost and for which benefits have been quantified,
about 63% of benefits would accrue to the rural population having incomes
below the absolute poverty level. The water supply and schistosomiasis
components, for which benefits were not quantified, would also benefit the
absolute poor.

SAMAR ISLAND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Accounting Procedures for Force Account Work
1.        The only portion of the project that would be undertaken through
force account is the drilling of about 50% of the wells included in the pro-
ject. Such expenditure would include cost of labor, fuel and miscellaneous
materials not financed under the loan (major materials and equipment would
be financed under the loan and would be procured after international compe-
titive bidding). The force account work is estimated to cost about US$0.4
million which is about 1% of the total project cost. The decision to carry
out this work though force account is based on the need to strengthen MPW's
implementation capability, maintain an active presence in Samar, and facili-
tate construction of wells in relatively inaccessible areas not attractive
to contractors.
2.        A Bank mission visited the regional office of MPW in Tacloban and
examined the relevant budgeting and accounting procedures. The district
offices submit to the regional office an annual program of well construction
which includes location of wells, estimated depths, quantities and cost of
materials, equipment and labor, and an implementation schedule. The annual
program is reviewed by the regional office, and after relevant modifications
is sanctioned for implementation, with each well being provided a project
code. During implementation, district offices submit monthly progress
reports for each well providing information on implementation and costs with
comparisons to targets. On completion of construction, a summary is
prepared for each well providing information on physical characteristics
(e.g., well depth), and actual and originally estimated inputs and costs of
material and labor for use in consolidation of annual accounts and for
future planning and budgeting purposes.
3.        The requisition and issue of materials and the recording of labor
and supervisory time is properly organized and adequately staffed, both at
the district and regional offices of MPW, to perform these functions. Pro-
curement of major materials is undertaken by the regional office and copies
of contracts and payments are immediately sent to the regional office of the
Commission on Audit (COA). Periodically, auditors and technical personnel
of the COA inspect such delivered materials. The issuing of materials to
the district offices for use in construction is properly recorded and
debited against the project they are used for. Regional staff of MPW and,
periodically, the district level auditors of COA make field inspections to
check on usage of materials. Miscellaneous materials for construction are
bought by the district engineer of MPW and the bill for such materials, the
project code and a certificate of delivery of such materials are sent to the
regional office of MPW and the COA. Here again, there are periodic inspec-
tions of the use of such materials by the MPW regional office and the COA.

ANNEX 3
Page 2
When issuing payment to the supplier for materials delivered, the disbursing
officer matches the documents sent by the district engineer and those pre-
sented by the supplier, records the project code, and debits the amount
against the particular project. Similarly, recording of labor time and cost
is undertaken in an orderly manner. Every two weeks, a time sheet is
submitted by the district engineer to the regional office providing names of
personnel, their duties, time spent, cost, and the code of the project they
worked on. This is the basis for issuing of wages by the disbursing officer
who debits these costs against the projects under construction. All
accounts are maintained and audited in accordance with appropriate pro-
cedures laid down by the Government and MPW's annual statements are audited
by the COA.
4.        Disbursement of such force account work by MPW would be made
against certificates of expenditure. MPW would maintain separate accounts
for wells included in the project and these accounts would be available for
inspection by supervision missions.
