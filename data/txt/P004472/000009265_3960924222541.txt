SAMAR ISLAND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1772-PH)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Samar Island
Rural Development Project in the Philippines, for which Loan 1772-PH in the
amount of US$27.0 million was approved on December 4, 1979. The Loan
Closing Date was extended three times to March 31, 1988. The Loan was
fully drawn when the last disbursement was made on February 24, 1988.
Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by staff of the
Agriculture Operations Division if Country Department II of the Asia
Regional Office (AS2AG). These were based on a draft report by the
FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program (FAO/CP) on behalf of the Government of
the Philippines (GOP). Detailed terminal reports for the various project
components were provided by GOP through the Project Office which had been
responsible for coordinating project implementation. Use was also made of
the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 2627-PH), Bank supervision reports, project
progress and annual reports, and interviews with staff of the Bank and the
Borrower who were involved in project design and implementation.
The Asia Regional Office wishes to express its appreciation to the
officials of the Departments and other agencies of the Borrower for their
7aluable assistance in producing this PCR.
The d.aft PCR was sent to the Borrower and its agencies for their
comments on August 31 for inclusion in Part II, and a reply was received
from the National Irrigation Administration on October 2, 1990.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PHILIPPINES
SAMAR ISLAND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1772-PH)
Evaluation Summary
Project Background
1.          The Samar Island Rural Development  Project  was one of a series
projects developed by the Government of the Philippines (GOP) during the
1970s, under the aegis of its Integrated Area Development (IAD) program.
With a rural per capita income of only US$85, compared to the national
average of US$135 (1975), Samar Island was one of the least developed areas
of the Philippines at the time the project was identified. Agriculture
dominated the local economy, but annual production and average yields were
very low despite abundant rainfall and good soils. The main obstacle to
development in Samar was considered to be the limited availability and poor
condition of rural infrastructure: farmers isolated from markets had little
incentive to produce a surplus, and most did not use purchased inputs due to
high transport costs. Low productivity was also believed to be a consequence
of poor health, with some 8Zto 142 of the population being infected by
schistosomiasis.
Prolect Obiectives and Description
2.          The project was  designed  to  support  parts of a comprehensive
development plan for Samar Island, in parallel with other externally
(Australia, Japan, World Bank) and locally funded operations. It was
expected   to   induce   socio-economic   development   by   improving   the
transportation network, extending irrigation facilities, and providing safe
water supply and better disease control to raise rural health standards. The
major components included the improvement of about 230 km of dational roads
in Eastern Samar; rehabilitation of the Catbalogan port in Western Samar;
construction of about 2,000 he of communal irrigation systems in Northern
and Western Samar; construction and improveaent of about 2,300 wells and 300
springs  in   rural   communities;   support   for  schistosomiasis  control
activities; and consulting services for a feasibility study for the
development of the Catubig Valley in Northern Samar. The project was costed
at US$62.6 million.   Bank  Loan  1772-PH  of  US$27.0 million was signed on
February X, 1980. The Closing Date was extended three times from June 30,
1985 to March 31, 1988, and the Loan was fully drawn when the last
disbursemen' was made on February 24, 1988.

Project Implementation
3.          Effective  project  organization   and  management  arrangements
contributed to the relatively smooth physical implementation of the project,
notwithstanding unforeseen delays due to natural calamities (typhoons,
floods and earthquakes), an adverse peace and order situation, cumbersome
procedures for obtaining budgetary allocations and release of funds, and
prolonged negotiations over the procedures for covering the foreign exchange
portion of payments due to contractors.
4.          The main variances between planned and actual project activities
included a significant change in road standards and a 502 reduction in the
targets of the communal irrigation component; there were also minor
reductions in the targets of the roads and water supply components. Local
engineering staff pressed for higher road standards than those recommended
by the appraisal mission, because Samar is typhoon-prone. The Bank finally
agreed three years after Loan effectiveness, with the result that the cost
of the roads component nearly doubled from US$25 to US$50 million.
Irrigation potential was overestimated at appraisal, with problems including
insufficient water availability in some catchments, unsuitability of other
areas and land tenure problems.
Project Results
5.          Project objectives  did  not  change  during implementation, and
most revised physical targets were achieved, particularly those concerning
better health standards, safe village drinking water and an improved road
network. Nonetheless, the project has had only a limited economic impact,
because of the much higher costs of the roads component and the lower than
expected benefits of most components. The impact of the very expensive road
component has been severely reduced because of a missing link between the
East Samar road network assisted under the project and the national network
in the West, which was to have been constructed under GOP's regular program,
but was not yet finished at project completion. Rehabilitation of Catbalogan
port has had only a limited impact: overall cargo movement has increased,
but passenger traffic declined because of a new modern ferry link between
Northern Samar and Luzon, and a pier extended under the project was damaged
by successive typhoons and rendered unusable pending completion of repairs.
Irrigated paddy yields attained were a satisfactory 3.5 tons/ha, but
slightly more than half of the 1,009 ha of the communal irrigation schemes
still require some additional work at completion; and 402 of the wells
constructed were suffering from mechanical defects at project completion.
The health component had very impressive results: schistosomiasis on Samar
Island was reduced to a controllable 42 to 62, and the strategy of
integrating village health workers, midwives and sanitary inspetXors into
the schistosomiasis control program proved very successful.
6.          The re-estimated economic rate  of  return at completion for the
roads component (accounting for 792 of final project costs) was 42; the ERR
for the communal irrigation component (32 of costs) was negative; the ERR
for port rehabilitation could not be recalculated, but it would most likely
be negative as well.    The  substantial  benefits  of the successful health



-v -
component are not captured in the  ERR  analysis.   The  overall project ERR
may improve in future if the missing road link between the East and West
Samar road networks (para. 5) is completed, but benefits are not likely to
compensate the expensive road standards finally adopted.
Project Sustainability
7.          Sustainability of project  benefits  will  depend  mainly on the
extent to which project activities are integrated into the regular programs
of the line agencies. Current under-funding of maintenance work by GOP is a
particular  concern,  because  deficient   maintenance  will  aggravate  the
potential damage from typhoons, floods, etc. and reduce the economic life of
the project infrastructure.
Bank Performance
8.          Weak technical preparation of  several  components and less than
thorough appraisal were important factors underlying the unsuccessful
outcome of the project. Project supervision by the Bank was adequate.
Borrower Performance
9.          Greater involvement  of  line  agencies  in  project preparation
would have been desirable, but project management during implementation was
generally satisfactory. The Borrower's delay in completing related, non-
project investments (namely the link between the East and Wast road
networks) and inadequate funding for maintenance of project infrastructure
are having a depressing effect on project results.
Findings and Lessons Learned
10.         Even relatively small  communal  irrigation systems require more
-areful site selection, technical preparation and analysis of economic
viability than was the case in this project.
11.         More advanced  preparation  of  transport  infrastructure should
have been achieved prior to appraisal, with careful attention to alternative
sites (port rehabilitation component) and to the economic implications of
alternative design standards (roads component).
12.         All investments  on  which  the  economic  outcome  is dependent
should have been included in the project (road link between East and West
networks);   in addition,  a specific  undertaking should have been included
in the Loan Agreement, reflecting the Borrower's commitment to complete
essential non-project investments in a timely manner.
13.         Greater attention  should  have  been  paid  to arrangements for
ensuring adequate maintenance of project infrastructure after completion.
14.         Project risks should have  been  better identified at appraisal,
and carefully reflected in the project implementation schedule and in the
analysis of the economic viability of the project.

2.          Background
2.1         Samar Island, with a  population  of  1.1  million (lQ'5) and a
total area of 1.34 million ha, was one of the least developed a.¢as of the
Philippines at the time  the  project  was  identified.   The 1975 Nacional
Census showed an average per capita rural income 4-n Samar of only US$85,
compared to the national average of US$135. Agriculture employed about 752
of the economically active population. Rice was grown on about 126,000 ha
of river valleys and plains. Northern and Eastern Samar were rice surplus
provinces, while Western Samar and the whole island in general were net
importers, main3y from nearby islands. Coconuts were grown on about 250,000
ha and exported in the form of copra. Despite abundant rainfall and good
soils, annual production and average yields were low, at about 1.2 ton/hd
for paddy and 0.9 ton/ha of copra.
2.2         The main  obstacle  to  agricultural  development  in Samar was
considered to be the poor condition of the existing main roads and the lack
of smaller feeder roads. Many bridges on the national coastal highway in
Eastern Samar were temporary structures which could not carry even small
trucks when fully loaded. Farmers had little incentive to produce a
surplus, because they were isolated from markets and most did not use
purchased inputs because of high transport costs. Low productivity was also
considered to be a consequence of the poor health of the widely scattered
rural population of Samar. The lack of safe water from wells, and hence the
use of open water sources, caused the spread of a number of water-borne
diseases. About 102 of the population was infected by schistosomiasis.
Health services in Samar were not readily available and were of poor
quality, suffering from inadequately trained staff and lack of equipment,
physical facilities and drugs.



-  2  -
2.3     In the early 1970s, the Government of the Philippines (GOP) embarked
on a programme of Integrated Area Development (IAD), to address the
development needs of previously neglected and economically depressed rural
areas such as Samar.   The  IAD  concept involved the close coordination and
synchronization of various Government agencies to utilize more effectively
resources for the development of selected geographical areas. Priority was
given to low-income areas considered to have g,.d development potential and
where relatively small incremental investments %ould therefore generate high
benefits. The project was one of a series of operations based on this
concept.
3.          Project Objectives and Description
3.1         Objectives.  The project was designed to support parts of a more
comprehensive development plan and investment program for Samar Island
(para. 4.1). The objective was to induce socio-economic development by
extending irrigation facilities, improving the transportation network, and
providing safe water supply and better disease control to raise health
standards.
3.2         Components.  The major components envisaged at appraisal were:
(a)   Irrigation:  (i)  construction  of  about  2,000  ha of communal
irrigation systems in Northern and Western Samar; and 1ii) procurement of
vehicles for the Natinnial Irrigation Administration (NIA) and the Farm
Systems Development Corporation (FSDC);
(b)   Water Supply:  (i)  construction  and improvement of about 2,300
wells and 300 springs in small rural communities; (ii) procurement of
drilling equipment and materials for construction; and (iii) provision for
technical assistance and training for Ministry of Public Works (MPW)
personnel;
(c)   Schistosomiasis  Control:    (i)  construction  of  three  field
laboratories and procurement of vehicles, laboratory and health education
equipment for disease diagnosis and conducting intensified malacological and
parasitological surveys; and  (ii)    procurement  of  drugs for large-scale
chemotherapy in municipalities of highest schistosomiasis prevalence;
(d)   Transportation:  (i)  improvement  of  about  230 km of national
roads  in  Eastern  Samar;   (ii)   provision  of  consultant  services  for
supervision of construction; and (iii) rehabilitation of the port of
Catbalogan in Western Samar; and
(e)   Catubig Valley Development Study:   consulting services to carry
out a feasibility study for the development for the Catubig Valley in
Northern Samar.



4.          Project Design and Organization
4.1         The project concept and design  were  based on the IAD approach
adopted by the GOP (para 2.3), and also supported by the Bank under three
additional loans for other rural development projects in the Philippines
(Part III, Section 1). The overall development programme for Samar was more
comprehensive  than   the   Bank-supported   project   and   included:  (a)
construction of irrigation  systems;  (b)  construction  of   flood c3ntrol
dikes and drainage canals in the Catubig Valley in Northern Samar; (c)
construction  and  rehabilitation   of   rural   wells   and  springs;  (d)
construction  and  improvement   of   secondary   and   feeder  roads;  (e)
rehabilitation of four ports; (f) construction of the power transmission
and  distribution  system   in   Northern   Samar;   (g)    improvement  of
communication facilities; and (h) establishment of agricultural training
centers and demonstration  farms.    The  feasibility  study  for the Samar
Integrated Rural Development Project (SIRDP) wzs prepared by the Project
Planning  ,..d  Development  Office   (PPDO)   of  the  Ministry  of  Works,
Transportation and Communications (MPWTC).
4.2         The Bank project was  intended  to  support that part of PPDO's
proposed investment program which was not covered by other parallel ongoing
or  planned  development  activities.        In  particular,  the  Australian
Government financed selected activities in  Northern Samar, through a grant
of US$28 million for the construction of 180 km of roads, rehabilitation of
San  Jose  Port,  piped  water   supplies  for  five  towns,  provision  of
electricity from the town of Wright in Western Samar to Catarman in the
North, and improved agricultural development through demonstration farms,
extension aids, equipment and vehicles, and technical assistance. A
Japanese-assisted road development project in Western Samar, locally funded
projects for other roads and for support to the fishing industry, and a
Bank-financed Agricultural Extension Project (Ln. 1626-PH) and a Second
Population Project (Cr. 923-PH) were also considered to be significant
complementary investments. The Samar Integrated Rural Development Project
was intended to induce agricultural development through improvement and
expansion of irrigation and transportation infrastructure and health
services.
4.2         Project organization and  management  arrangements were largely
effective and played a major role in the relatively smooth implemeatation
of the project, notwithstanding delays due to natural calamities (typhoons,
floods, earthquakes) and the uneasy peace and order situation. Strong
Government political will to address the basic needs of Samar Island
appears to have been an important factor. The Samar Integrated Rural
Development Project Office (SIRDPO), which reported directly to the
National  Economic  and  Development   Authority  (NEDA),  was  created  by
Presidential Decree in 1976 to coordinate the planning and implementation
of the overall development program for Samar. SIRDPO had well-qualified
management and was given sufficient budget and autonomy to recruit suitable
staff on a contractual basis, as well as to attract a number of good staff
on secondment from othsr Government departments. All project expenditures,



whether undertaken directly by SIRDPO or by the line agencies, were
channeled by the central Government through SIRDPO, which made it possible
for project management to monitor closely the progress and quality of work
by the line agencies and outside contractors.
5.          Project Implementation
5.1         Project targets were  revised  downwards during implementation,
as following:
Component              Unit        Planned       Final
Roads                   km            230            221
Communal irrigation    ha           2,000           1,000
Rural water supply
- Wells                 no.        2,300           2,137
-  Springs              no.           300              62
5.2         The most critical variance  between  planned and actual project
implementation related to the design standards of the roads component,
which accounted for the largest item of expenditure (55Z of total project
costs at appraisal and 79Z at completion). The appraisal mission had
decided on a low cost solution, with detailed designs to be prepared at a
later stage. In the event, local engineering staff disagreed with the
standards recommended by the appraisal mission, because of the typhoon-
prone conditions of Samar. This debate generated political interest and
attention, and ultimately resulted in a change in design standards three
years after loan effectiveness, from gravel to asphalt surfacing. This
raised the estimated civil works costs for roads from about US$25 million
to sightly under US$50 million with price escalation. The cost overrun was
met fully by the Government.
5.3         With regard  to  the  communal  irrigation  systems  (CIS), the
appraisal target of 2,000 ha had to :,e scaled down by about half (to 1,009
ha) during implementation for various reasons, including insufficient water
availability in some catchment areas resulting from illegal logging,
unsuitability cf other  areas  and  land  tenure  problems.   The remaining
project components, namely village drinking water supply, rehabilitation of
the Catbalogan port, Schistosomiasis control and the study for the
development of the Catubig Valley, were implemented according to plan.
5.4         The major factors which delayed project implementation were the
peace and order situation and natural calamities, which caused slippages of
up to several months at a time and, consequently, higher project costs.



- 5 -
Prolonged negotiations over the procedures for covering the foreign
exchange portion of payments due to contractors also adversely affected the
implementation schedule. The SAR did not identify any project risks and
hence no precautionary measures were adopted in anticipation of these
problems.
6.          Project Results
6.1         Project objectives did  not  change  during implementation, and
the project succeeded in achieving most of its revised physical targets,
including better health standards, safe drinking water at village level and
an improved road  network.    Project  management  has  reported an overall
achievement of higher than 99% of physical targets; the FAO-CP completion
mission was not in a position to verify the completion of all components,
but did observe during field inspections that there had been impressive
physical and social achievements in the selected areas visited by the
mission.
6.2         These physical accomplishments notwithstanding, it appears the
the project has thus far had only limited economic results, because of t1ie
much higher costs of the roads component on the one hand and the lower znan
expected benefits of most components on the other. The impact of the very
expensive road component has been severely reduced because of a missing
link between the East Samar road network constructed under the project and
the national network in the West, which was to have been completed under
the Government's regular program. At appraisal it was anticipated (but not
negotiated as a condition of the Loan) that this link would be in place
before the commencement of project road construction, but to date some 6 km
of the road still remain to be constructed. The rehabilitation of
Catbalogan port has also had only a limited impact. The overall movement of
cargo increased by 30Z, albeit with very large yearly fluctuations between
1979 and 1987, but passenger traffic declined due primarily to the
construction of a modern ferry link between Northern Samar and Luzon
Island, the significance of which was undeL-estimated at appraisal. Also,
the increase in cargo volume has occurred despite the fact that Pier No. 2,
which was extended under the project at a cost of P3.8 million, was damaged
by successive typhoons and has been rendered unusable pending completion of
repair works reported to be underway.
6.3         The impact  of  the  project  health  component  has been quita
impressive:  the  project  reduced   the   rate  of  schistosomiasis  to  a
controllable 4% to 6%, down from a high 82 to 14Z. Aside from attacking
the disease carrier (the snail) and treating individual cases, the project
adopted a new strategy whereby village health workers, midwives and
sanitary inspectors were integrated into the overall schistosomiasis
control program in  order  to  track  the  disease.    It  is  now hoped to
eliminate the disease in Samar by the early 1990s, provided sufficient
Government support is forthcoming to continue project activities under the
regular program of the Department of Health. The results of the village



- 6 -
water supply component are more disappointing, considering the reported
physical achievements: of the 2,137 wells actually constructed, about 950
were not functional at project completion due to mechanical defects, and
only 64Z of the other wells yielded potable water.
6.4         The  impact  of  the   irrigation  component,  as  measured  by
increased rice production,  was  very  low.    Not  only  were the original
targets for irrigation development halved, but of the 1,009 ha reported by
NIA to have been developed under the project, only 454 ha were actually
irrigated at project completion. The remaining 555 ba are still in need of
additional work. The yields obtained by project beneficiaries in the
developed areas are reasonably good (3.5 t/ha), but the small scale of the
development which has taken place reinforces the conclusion that even
small-scale irrigation projects require high standards of evaluation and
engineering.
6.5         TChe main differences between the results projected at appraisal
and those actually achieved as of project completion are attributable to
the considerably higher cost of the road component, the over-estimation of
the potential for irrigation development and the failure to anticipate
project risks associated with natural calamities and the local peace and
order situation. The re-estimated economic rate of return for the roads
component (accounting for 79Z of final project costs) was 4Z, and the ERR
for the communal irrigation component (32 of costs) was negative. The ERR
for the port rehabilitation component could not be recalculated due to data
problems, but it would most likely be negative as well (Part III, Section
6(b)). The Bank should have foreseen the economic implications of its
decision to approve GOP's proposal to upgrade road construction standards,
but the completion mission was unable to find any recorded discussion of
this aspect of the issue in the project files. For the future, it should
be noted that the project ERR may improve after completion of the missing
road link between the East and West Samar road networks (para. 6.2). Also,
the ERR calculation does not capture either the substantial social benefits
to .he population of the successful health component, or the benefits of
increased economic activity in the project area which has been made
possible because of project investments.
7.          Project Sustainability
7.1         Sustainability of project  benefits  will  depend mainly on the
extent to which project activities are integrated into the regular programs
of  the  line  agencies.  In   particular,  the  under-funding  by  GOP  of
maintenance work on project infrastructure (roads, irrigation dikes,
village wells, etc.) is a major concern. Field observations by the
completion mission point to highly deficient maintenance of all project
infrastructure, which will certainly aggravate the potential damage from
typhoons, floods, etc. and reduce the economic life of the investments.
Other project-initiated activities (e.g., schistosomiasis control; farm
development in the area of the communal irrigation systems) also require
sufficient operating support by the concerned line agencies.

8.          Bank Performance
8.1         The   Bank's   involvement   in   project   identification  and
preparation appears to  have  been  minimal,  with  most work undertaken by
local agencies. Weak  technical  preparation  of several project components
and less  than  thorough  appraisal  by  the  Bank  were  important factors
contributing to the unsuccessful outcome  of  the  project.   A total of 13
supervision missions were fielded by the Bank from March 1980 to May 1987.
Although field supervision of the project was generally adequate in terms
of the total amount of time spent, it is notable that no health specialist
participated in any of the    supervision  missions, although that fact did
not apparently have any adverse impact on the successful outcome of the
project  schistosomiasis  control   activities.   Staff  continuity  during
supervision was good.
9.          Borrower Performance
9.1         Project preparation was undertaken  by the Borrower's PPDO, but
greater involvement of all line agencies would have been desirable.
Project management was relatively satisfactory. An independent and well-
organized project office (SIRDPO) in charge of planning and coordination of
the various project functions, and the fact that no major problems were
encountered with staff deployment for project implementation, helped to
achieve good physical performance. On the other hand, cumbersome procedures
for  obtaining  budgetary  allocations   and   the  release  of  funds  for
operational purposes by the line agencies were a major shortcoming. The
Borrower's delay in completing related, non-project investments (namely the
link between the East and West road networks, para. 6.2) and its inadequate
funding of maintenance of project infrastructure (para. 7.1) are having a
depressing effect on the results of the project.
10.         Project Relationships
10.1        Relationships between the  Bank  and  the Borrower, and between
them and the agencies participating in the project, were cordial throughout
the preparation and implementation  phases.   However, the design standards
for the roads component, and the mode of payment to international
contractors for road construction, became major issues which took a long
time to resolve, suggesting less than adequate discussion and agreement on
these matters during project appraisal.
11.         Consulting Services
11.1        External and local consultants and contractors were engaged for
major project works, including construction of roads, rehabilitaiton of the
Catbalogan port and the feasibility study of the Catubig Valley. Their
performance was satisfactory. Delays in .onstruction were due to changes
in road design, deferrea payments to contractors, the adverse peace and



order situation and severe  climatic  conditions.    The mode of payment to
contractors (particularly the for-eign exchange portion) became a major
issue, which was ultimately resolved when the Bank agreed to make direct
payment. Nonetheless, the contractors completed the work satisfactorily,
based on the revised targets and standards.
12.         Lessons Learned
12.1        The following main lessons can be drawn based on the experience
of this project:
(a)   even relatively small communal irrigation systems require
careful site selection, technical preparation and analysis of
economic viability;
(b)   more advanced preparation of transport infrastructure should be
achieved prior to appraisal than was the case in this project,
with very careful attention to alternative sites (for port
rehabili4ation) and to the economic implications of alternative
design standards (for the roads component);
(c)   consideration should be given to the inclusion in a project of
all investments on which its economic outcome is dependent (the
road link between the East and West networks); in addition,
firm agreement should be reached with the Borrower on a
timetable and financing plan for the implementation of critical
non-project investments and this should be included as a
specific undertaking in the Loan Agreement;
(d)   greater attention should be paid to arrangements for ensuring
adequate maintenance of project infrastructure after
completion; and
(e)   better identification of project risks should be made at
appraisal, with the implications carefully reflected in the
project implementation schedul and taken into account in the
analysis of the economic viabi   y of the project.
13.         Project Documentation and Data
13.1        The SAR provided the framework for project implementation, with
some modifications were introduced, as agreed between the Borrower and the
Bank. The provisions of the Loan Agreement were generally adhered to, and
few amendments were effected during the course of implementation. Although
the Borrower did not prepare the PCR as envisaged in .ne Loan Agreement,
it did provide, through SIRDPO, detailed terminal reports f r the various
project components.   These,  together  with  other  sources or information
(SAR, Bank  supervision  reports,  project  progress  anu  annual reports),
provided an adequate basis for preparation of the PCR.

PART II - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A comprehensive completion report was prepared by the Borrower
with the assistance of FAO/CP. The Borrower was also given the opportunity
to comment on Parts I and III of this report as prepared by AS2AG which
were generally consistent with the original report. The National
Irrigation Administration responded with the following observations on the
irrigation component which are not at variance with the observations and
conclusions of Parts I and III.
"The project's irrigation component had the following results:
1. A 50 percent reduction in target area from 2,000 ha to 1,000 ha
due to overestimation of irrigation potential at appraisal with
problems including insufficient water, unsuitability of other
areas and land tenure.
2. Irrigated paddy yields were at a satisfactory 3.5 tons/ha.
3. The EIRR was negative due to reduction of area.
With lessons learned in this project and other similar NIA projects,
the agency is now undertaking several measures to carefully select,
screen and evaluate communal irrigation projects at preparation stage
before construction commences. We are particularly concerned on the
systematic determination of area given the hydrological, technical,
and institutional information.
At present, Samar provinces like other low-income provinces are given
adequate provisions for irrigation development.
We have no further comment to the PCR".

Comments: Issues Raised at Various Stages of the Project Cycle
Identification: The feasibility report prepared by GOP was seen by
the Bank more as a regional planning study than a project identification
report.
Preparation:   The  absence  of  sufficient  involvement  by  the line
agencies in the project preparation process was a major issue of concern to
the Bank.
Post-Appraisal: The major issues raised internally in the Bank after
project appraisal were as follows (Decision Memorandum of April 20, 1979):
(a) Why, in a rural development project, were there no other
agricultural investments other than a very small irrigation component? The
reply was that: (i) agricultural aspects were being covered in three
separate but inter-related programs, namely, an Australian Government-
1   By GO? (Project Planning and Development Office of Ministry of
Public Works, Transportation and Communication).
2   SAR (No. 2627-PH) dated November 12, 1979.

supported agricultural development project in Northern and Western Samar; a
coconut development program on the island for which a memorandum of
agreement had been signed between the Philippine Coconut Authority and the
SIRDP project office; and provision under another WB loan for strengthening
the National Extension Service, also in Samar; and (ii) until the other
components, particularly roads and ports, were completed, few benefits would
be derived from the inclusion of additional agricultural components.
(b) The justification for the large roads component (nearly half of
project costs at appraisal) rested on the poor condition of the coastal road
and the lack of feeder roads, which constituted a major obstacle to
agricultural development and isolated farmers from markets and supporting
services. Because of Bank concern that, historically, road maintenance had
been below suitable standards, attempts were made to obtain assurances from
Government regarding an appropriate maintenance program.
(c) The approach used in the rural water supply component was to be
consistent with that of a pilot project also to be financed by the Bank
under the Second Provincial Cities Water Supply Project. Involvement of the
village communities - particularly the women, as the main users - in the
design and operation of the water supply system was also emphasized.

J/ Totals may not add up due to rounding.
Commentsf:
The 39% overrun in the total project costs was caused exclusively
by the substantial increase in the cost of the road component (which more
than doubled the appraisal estimate), due to the upgrading (agreed by the
Bank) of road standards and implementation delays. On the other hand, the
costs of the other components were below original estimates,<1> except for
the Catubig Valley study.
<1>      For communal irrigation, rural water supply and schistosomiasis
control, this was due also to lower physical achievements.

Weighted                       15                                 4
Underlying Assumptions:
1.    Roads.  Benefits from this  component  were determined at appraisal as
the difference in road user costs excluding taxes, with and without the
project, for non-agricultural traffic, plus the value of net incremental
production attributable to road improvement.    For the purposes of the PCR,
savings in operating and maintenance costs were assessed by the Department
of Public Works and Highways4
in economic terms using the most recent conversion factors estimated by the
World Bank  (Annex).    Of  various  scenarios  proposed  by  DPWH regarding
projected traffic growth and the level of maintenance and operating cost
savings, the mission adopted as base case the following: future traffic
growth based on actual 1988 figures; savings in passenger time; and
reduction in yearly maintenance cost savings by 50Z and vehicle operating
costs savings by 152 from Year 11 (1990) onwards to take account of the low
level of maintenance observed by the  mission.    On the other hand, lack of
data prevented the quantification of net incremental production attributable
to road improvement, although this has reportedly increased the prices
(particularly of coconuts) which farmers have been obtaining by marketing
their output directly outside their immediate area.
2.    Catbalogan Port Rehabilitation.   At  appraisal benefits were measured
in  terms  of  the  amount   port   users   would  be  willing  to  pay  for
rehabilitation, expressed by the cost of transport from Catbalogan to
Tacloban (the other port, at the time, which handled ships from Samar Island
to Manila and Cebu). In reality, however, benefits - albeit unquantifiable
4   "Post-Evaluation Report, Eastern Samar, National Secondary Roads", DPWH,
November 1988. The rates of return obtained in this report were over-
estimated due to the inclusian of road construction costs in current
terms when they should have been updated to 1988 constant prices, in
which benefits were expressed.



- 19 --
- from this project component are probably negative in view of the following
considerations. Pier 2, whose rehabilitation was financed by the project,
is still not operational, partly due to damages caused by recent typhoons.
Philippines Port Authority (PPA) data on Catbalogan port traffic show an
overall decline for passengers and cargo (despite an absolute increase for
cargo between 1979 and 1987, large yearly fluctuations point to a very
erratic performance), which may be explained by external factors such as the
completion of a modern ferry boat link between Northern Samar (at Alegria)
and the southern tip of Luzon island, as well as of secondary roads in parts
of Samar.  Although  PPA  forecasts  of  future  traffic are optimistic, the
actual data obtained up to now do not permit, in the mission's opinion, such
optimism and no real trend  can  be  ascertained at this stage. Whatever the
past and/or future trend, traffic volume to date has been independent of
Pier 2, which seriously raises the original justification for inclusion of
this component under the project.
3.    Irrigation.  Benefits  were  estimated  at  appraisal  on the basis of
incremental paddy production on 2,000 ha to be irrigated under this project.
The same assumptions/methodology were adopted in preparing the PCR, but on a
total of only 454 ha effectively irrigated (354 ha of new irrigation and 100
ha rehabilitated), out of 1,009 ha actually constructed. Production was
calculated using average cropping intensities and yields actually obtained
(2.0 t/ha rainfed, 3.5 t/ha irrigated at full development). Farm costs and
benefits, expressed in 1988 prices, were translated into economic terms
using border  prices  and  specific  conversion  factorc  (Annex).   The ERR
achieved by the project under these assumptions is negative, not only
because the actual area under irrigation is much small.er than expected at
appraisal, but also because construction costs occurred several years before
actual irrigation (in the  first  scheme)  could be imple. 'nted and benefits
derived.
4.    Project ERR.  The  weighted  ERR  for  the project (41"' was calculated
taking into  account  only  those  components  for  which  b).efits could be
quantified, i.e. roads and communal irrigation (accountinw fir 79Z and 3?,
respectively, of total project  costs).    Considerable impact, however, has
been made by the project's social components (rural water supply and
schistosomiasis  control),  although  the   benefits  cannot  be  adequately
measured.

Comments
Farm incomes. Results at appraisal were derived from farm budgets
prepared for the Palali (eventually excluded from the project) and Calapi
systems  for  representative  farm sizes and by types of tenure. PCR mission
estimates are based on sketchy data obtained from farmers interviewed in the
field,  which cannot always be reconciled with those provided to the project
office by the NIA or agricultural staff.
Cost recovery. Irrigation charges were to be paid by farmers
towards the recovery of both capital and maintenance costs of the project's
communal irrigation systems, in the form of 2 cavans (1 cavan = 50 kg) of
paddy per year, of which 1.5 cavans go to the NIA (construction) and 0.5
cavans to the relevant Irrigator Service Associations for maintenance.
Collection   of   these   irrigation   charges  is  reported  to  have  been
satisfactory, although not at 100%.

DETAILED ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
General
1.    Although the project  made  a  definite  impact  on the socio-economic
conditions of the population of Samar Island, benefitting the community at
large, an important part of these benefits cannot be quantified. Measurable
benefits derive from two of the components: roads and communal irrigation -
the first accounting for almost 802 of the total project costs (against 55Z
at appraisal). A third component, the _ehabilitation of Catbalogar. port,
was also evaluated at appraisal, with an expected ERR of 19Z. However,
actual conditions and available data do not permit a precise post-project
quantification of benefits.
Assumptions
2.    The economic  analysis  of  the  roads  and  irrigation components was
carried out on the basis of actual project costs and estimated benefits,
expressed in 1988 constant prices using international and domestic inflation
rates5 , respectively, for the foreign exchange and local portions of the
costs, and translated into economic terms by applying, where relevant,
border prices calculated for major outputs (rice) and inputs (fertilizers)
and conversion factors supplied by the World Bank as follows:
-  Standard Conversion Factor (SCF)          0.86
-  Conversion Factor for capital goods       0.86
-  Conversion Factor for construction        0.84
-  Conversion Factor for unskilled labor   0.66
Roads
3.    The basic data for assessing this major component were provided by the
Department of Public Works and Highways, using a computer model to project
future  traffic  based  on  certain  assumptions.    Rates  of  return  were
calculated for various cases, although the scenario found most relevant by
the mission takes account of actual 1988 traffic data and realistic
maintenance levels. The results are the following:
5   MUV indices estimated by the World Bank for international inflation
and consumer price indices measured by the Philippines National
Statistics Office for local inflation.

ERR (Z)
Base Case 1A                                            4.2
(traffic based on 1988 data, benefits
include savings in passenger time,
maintenance cost savings reduced by
502 and vehicle operating cost savings
by 15X from Year 11)
Case 1B                                                 2.4
(same as above, but excluding savings
in passenger time)
Case 2A                                                 5.0
(difference from 1A being that maintenance
and operating cost savings are kept at
constant level)
Case 2B                                                 3.2
(same as 2A, but excluding savings in
passenger time)
Irrigation
4.    Evaluation of  the  communal  irrigation  schemes  financed  under the
project was based on paddy crop budgets per ha reconstructed by the mission
for the "with" and "without" project situations, following farmer interviews
and SIRDP agricultural  data.    These  crop  budgets  were then applied, in
economic terms, to the total area under effective irrigation (454 ha)
according to actual implementation phased as follows:
Year     1984    1985    1986    1987    1988
New schemes
-  CIS                           Calagi  Rosario  Danao       -    San Jose
-  Ha                              35        95      125       -       99
Rehabilitated schemes
-  CIS                              -        -    Pandango   -        -
-  Ha                               -        -      100       -       -
6   Effectively irrigated out of a total of 270 ha constructed.

S.    Due to lack of precise data on farm sizes and land tenure, the mission
has  based  its  analysis  on   farm   incomes  from  1.5  ha  tenant  farms
(corroborated by farmer interviews) and 4 ha owner-operated farms (as was
assumed at appraisal for the Calapi scheme), each category taken at 50Z of
the total area. The ERR obtained for the irrigation component is negative,
the area under irrigation being much smaller than expected at appraisal
against costs which, although lower, were incurred several years before
effective implementation of the schemes.
Weighted ERRs
6.    The overall ERRs for the two  components combined are similar to those
estimated for the roads, due to the preponderance in weight (particularly
cost-wise) of this last component.
