SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
LOAN 1636-KE
PREFACE
This  is  the  Project   Completion   Report   (PCR)  of  the  Sugar
Rehabilitation Project in Kenya, for which Loan 1636-KE in the amount of
US$72 million was approved  on  December  5,  1978.    The Loan was closed as
scheduled on March 31, 1985; US$58 million was cancelled at the request of
the Government in September 1983 and a further US$1.2 millicn was cancelled
at the time of loan closing.   The  date of final disbursement was October 7,
1985.
The PCR was prepared by the Eastern and Southern Africa Regional
Office following a mission to Kenya Sa November 1985, and is based in part on
a draft completion report prepared by a consultant, a review of the Staff
Appraisal Report No. 1887-KE dated November 17, 1978, the President's Report
No. P-2412-KE dated November 17, 1978, the Loan Agreement of December 20,
1978, correspondance with the Borrower, material drawn from reports and
papers produced bv East African Sugar Industries Ltd. (EASI) and the Kenya
Sugar Authority (KSA), internal Bank memoranda on project issues as contained
in relevant Bank files, as well as interviews with officials both in the Bank
and in Kenya who have been assocAated with the project.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower on April 24,
1987 for comments. Borrower comments are attached as Annex 11.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KENYA - SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1636-KE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
(i)           Sugar production in Kenya has its origins in the 1920s.  By
the early 19709, there were five sugar factories in the country. Because of
the poor performance of the sugar industry, a need was felt to take
ameliorative action, and the Bank was approached for financial assistance.
oblectives
(ii)          The project was designed to rehabilitate and expand the sugar
companies at Miwani, Chemelil, Muhoroni and Ramisi, including the factories,
nucleus estates, outgrower cane areas and housing and transportation
infrastructure. It was expected that Kenya would reach self-sufficiency in
sugar In the early 1980s as a result of the project.
Implementation Experience and Results
(iii)         From a study of the genesis of this Project, it is apparent
that its success was always in doubt. Five basic flaws in the Project are
apparent. First, it seems that Government gave lower priority to
rehabilitation than to the construction of new factories. The Bank had a
different perception of relative priorities and favoured rehabilitation
before new construction. There was thus a fundamental lack of agreement
between Bank and Government on the priority to be given to the Project. In
fact, Government can be said to have shown little commitment to Project
objectives.
(iv)          Second, there were a number of basic policy issues that were
never resolved. Appraisal took two years and required four separate
missions, because of the large number of unresolved issues (para. 8.01). In
the absence of political will on the part of Government to solve these
issues, the technical solution adopted was the drawing up of numerous
covenants in an attempt to tie Government down to specific solutions. These
covenants caused delays in achieving effectiveness, because the sugar
companies, Kenya Sugar Authority (KSA), and Government could not appreciate
and fully understand the legal and financial requirements of the Loan
Agreement. Following loan effectiveness, Government began to back away from
its commitments, reflecting the fundamental differences of perception
between Bank and Government. The first such action was a volte face in
Government policy regarding the provision of funds to private sugar
companies. Most of the Project proved unimplementable because of this
problem, and a painful and costly process of cutting down the Project was
begun. It took three years to recast the Project and negotiate a
cancellation of US$ 58 million. The delays in decision making cost the
Government US$ 2.4 million in commitment fees. At the same time lack of



(v)
resolution of major sectoral policy issuess on cane and sugar pricing
levels, sugar sector development policy, mechanism for sugar sector
coordination, reduced the potential contribut½zn of the remaining
components.
(v)     Third, Government did not have the institutional mechanism to
coordinate and implement what was in fact a sugar rehabilitation program
loan.  The several Sugar Companies themselves were probably capable of
implementing their own sub--projects, but overall planning, formulation of
development policy, reconciliation between policy issues and
implementation was never achieved as no strong institution was
responsible for sugar policy or for the project. KSA made an effort but
had no authoritative power; it was in any case in a development stage
itself, and there was inadequate staff (both in numbers and experience)
in the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The Permanent Secretaries of
Finance and Agriculture, at separate times, criticized the complexity of
the Project and felt that a coordinating unit should have been built into
the Project in the first place.
(vi)    Fourth, Project costs were underestimated and the Project was
therefore underfunded. In the event, even the funding that was to be
provided by the one company that implemented a sub-project never
materialized as unfavorable movements in pricing policy and declining
sugar factory efficiency resulted in operating losses, not profits.
Finally, the implementation period coincided with the Government
budgetary crisis of 1981-84 and even the greatly reduced level of
resources allocated to the rump of the project could no; all be fitted
into the Government budget when required.
(vii)    The fourth and fifth flaws included underestimates of costs and
Government budgetary problems. These problems were common to other
projects appraised in the Region at this time. Unanticipated levels of
inflation and less rigorous Bank practices in making cost estimates at
the appraisal stage combined to make the cost estimates too low. HIgher
investment costs and lower international sugar prices caught the Kenya
Governments-unprepared, and there were losses fiscal losses which
Government could not manage properly.
(viii)   The Muhoroni sugar factory component (the only one implemented)
has only been partially successful. Appraisal cost estimates for
irrigation, drainage, road maintenance and the increase of the factory
capacity were too low and Government could not provide funds to bridge
the financing gap. As a result these components of the Muhoroni sub
project were not completed. When the Project design was revised in 1983
the housing component for Muhoroni was also cut back. Agricultural
development was delayed and at the closing date only 88% of the appraisal
estimates for the nucleus sugar estace and 45% of outgrowers lands had
been achieved. The Muhoroni program is howe: .r now showing results and
the financial rate of return to the combination of Government, farmers,
and MWhoroni Factory of the more limited investment actually undertaken



(vi)
is about 20S. Farmers and Government are the main beneficiaries (Government
from the high excise taxes collected on Muhoroni sugar sales). However, the
economic rate of return is 3% due to the low international price of sugar.
Sustainability
(ix)         Although project investments realized fell far short of
appraisal targets, enduring physical investments in improved and expanded
cane production area have been made and are now contributing to increased
output. Provided that financial incentives for growers and factory are
maintained at adequate levels, this production incres"e should represent a
permanent gain for the economy. However, project cane production may
outstrip processing capacity and complementary investments in Muhoroni
factory will be necessary if project output is to be sustained.
Findints and Lessons
(x)          Major lessons from the Project experience may be summarized as
follows:
(a) The lack of agreed priorities and a clear strategy for
sugar development in Kenya led to a shaky policy
foundation for the Project. The pragmatic solution
adopted by the Bank of trying to support two projects
(the Sugar Rehabilitation and SONY Projects) with quite
different characteristics failed. Both projects have
been poor performers. Full agreement between Government
and the Bank on investment priorities and strategy is a
prerequisite for successful investment. Agreement cannot
be easily worked out during the Implementation (para
1.04).
(b) Failure to resolve basic issues led to an unwieldy number
of covenants, to many of which Government had no
comitment.  The use of covenants to paper over
inconsistencies or disagreements on policy, places undue
strain on the legal documents &nd inevitably leads to
breaches of covenants. Resolution of basic sub-sector
issues should precede appraisal (para 2.10).
(c) The Project was very complicated, with fifteen
implementing agencies whose roles were not always clearly
defined. Overly complex design placed too great a burden
on weak executing agencies (para 3.07).



(vii)
(d)   Underestimated quantities and prices during technical
preparation and appraisal resulted in 'cost overruns".
Physical implementation consequently fell short of
appraisal targets, Greater precision of physical
estimates is now provided by Bank rulirgs on the level of
engineering necessary prior to Board presentation. Price
level changes remain difficult to forecast accurately*
(e)   The project required a 1;reat degree of administrative
support and coordivation. KSA could have handled this but
Its role was never properly defined and it lacked skilled
manpower and authority to do the job. Greater attention
to the role of sub-sector management and the need for a
coodinating institution in a rehabilitation program loan
is indicated.
(f)   If subsector issueG, particularly coordination and pricing
are resolved, properly managed sugar production in high
potential areas rould be a profitable and economically
justified activity in Kenya. Investment in rehabilitation
of existing estates and factories with potential would
probably yield satisfactcry returns, but expansion of area
or the creation of new factories would not.



KENYA
SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT (LOAN 1636-KE)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. Introduction
1.01     Although. sugar production in Kenya had its origins as far back
as the 1920's when two private factories (Miwani and Ramisi) were set up,
further development did not take place until 1966-73 when three more
factories were established (Muhoroni, Chemelil and Mumias). The
Government was the majority shareholder in these new factories. By 1976
the annual output of the five factories was 167,000 tons sugar derived
from about 51,000 ha sugar cane.
1.02     In 1976, the performance of the sugar industry was poor.  In
particular, management of smallholder services was deficient, resulting
in an uneven cane supply to factories, which operated about 402 below
capacity. This inefficiency made sugar an unprofitable investment snd
factories deteriorated as both private and jointly owned factory
companies were reluctant to reinvest in expensive plant and equipment.
It was clear that the industry would decline further unless corrective
action was taken.
1.03     Local demand for sugar in Kenya had exceeded local production
for several decades. Imports averaged 52,000 tons sugar per year from
1968 to 1976. In the mid 1970's it was estimated that, without new
projects, the annual deficit would reach about 205,000 tons sugar by
1985, rising to 355,000 tons by 1990. In view of the rising cost of
imports Government set out a policy to increase local production in order
to reach self sufficiency during the 1980's. Government commissioned a
survey (financed by UNDP) to work out an appropriate strategy. The
survey, carried out in 1975, outlined a sector strategy, defined
investment priorities and identified four projects. Highest priority was
awarded to a sugar rehabilitation project, comprising the rehabilitation
of Miwani Sugar Mills Ltd. (Miwani), Chemelil Sugar Company Ltd.
(Chemelil) aad East African Sugar Industries Ltd (Muhoroni) iu the Nyanza
Province sugar belt, together with Associated Sugar Company Ltd. (Ramisi)
In Coast Province, The three other projects identified were the
construction of new factories at Nzoia in Western Province and in South
Nyanza, and the doubling of the capacity of Mumias factory in Western
Province.
1.04     The Government accepted the conclusions of the survey but
changed the order of priority of investments to implement the creation of
new factories before rehabilitation. Projects to construct the Nzoia
factory (with French bilateral aid) and to double the capacity of Mumias
(with UK bilateral were agreed). The Bank was approached by Government
in late 1975 to co-finance the South Nyanza project (SONY). The Bank's
position was that the reorganization of the existing sugar industry was a
prerequisite to project investment and that better returns would accrue
from the rehabilitation of the existing industry than from new projects,
which could come later. The Bank therefore agreed to pre-appraise the
SONY project only reluctantly and on condition that Government would at
the same time commit itself to rehabilitation by requesting funding for a
rehabilitation project. The SONY project was appraised between May and
November, 1976 and an IBRD Loan of US$ 25 million was granted in April
1977. The Bank then proceeded with the appraisal of the Sugar
Rehabilitation Project.



II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Identification and Preparation
2.01     The Project was identified in the 1975 sugar survey (para.
1.03). The same consultants then prepared a feasibility report, with the
cooperation of the four sugar companies involved. The report was made
available in May, 1976.
Appraisal
2.02     The appraisal of the Project was a lengthy process lasting two
years and requiring no less than four separate missions. This was due to
the complexity of the project (which was more akin to a sub-sector
rehabilitation program than a project) and to the number and difficulty
of the technical and economic issues involved. Project design evolved
considerably during this period; the final project description at the end
of the appraisal period is shown below, paragraphs 2.08 - 2.09.
2.03     A pre-appraisal team visited Kenya in November 1976, discussed
the various proposals with Government and the sugar companies and
outlined the supplementary information which was required. A full
appraisal mission then visited Kenya in April, 1977 and the first
Issues/Decision process was completed by June, 1977. Issues were
numerous and could not be easily resolved. They hinged on: (i)
technical matters (drainage, irrigation, mechanized harvesting);
(ii) organization and management ( zoning, cane production to be a
factory responsibility, organization of outgrowers, the roles of the
Sugar Belt Cooperative Union (SBCU) the Sugar Settlement Organization
(SSO) and the Kenya Sugar Authority (KSA), improved labor conditions,
training); (ili) finance (outstanding SBCU and SSO loans, control over
factory investment, capital increases, levy for maintenance of roads and
drainage, financing gap, sugar pricing, six year disbursement period) and
(iv) the economic justification of certain project components. Appraisal
mission recommendations on these issues were generally accepted, except
on economic justification. It was decided that several critical
components in the project be subjected to separate economic analyses
before a decision could be made on their inclusion. The final
composition and project costs could not be determined until these
analyses were completed. The decision was therefore taken to send a
post-appraisal mission.
2.04     The third, post-appraisal, mission visited Kenya in October 1977
and held discussions with senior staff of the ministries involved
(Finance, Agriculture, Cooperatives, Lands and Settlement), Kenya Sugar
Authority (KSA), the National Irrigation Board (NIB) and the four factory
companies. The draft "White Cover" Staff Appraisal Report was presented
at a round up meeting held on October 24, 1977. The minutes of the
round-up meeting in Nairobi indicate agreement on the following decisions
from the Bank Decision Meeting:
(i)     Technical  Government accepted the Bank's proposal to
study the drainaRe prnblems and prepare a regional plan
for the Kano plains. Government agreed to set up a Roads



- 3 -
and Drainage Maintenance Fund (RDMF) with monies available
from the existing Price Equalization Fund. The new RDMF
would be made available to and be administered by KSA.
The Bank's irrigation proposals for Miwani and Kibos were
noted and Government confirmed the agreement to convert
the Ahero Scheme from rice to sugar rene. The Ministry of
Water Development would determine around water levels at
Ramisi through a special study. flechaniration of cane
harvesting would not be adopted and KSA, Ministry of Labor
and labor unions would devise means of increasing
harvesting labor.
(ii)     Organization and Management  The recent re-zoning was
considered adequate. On cane production and outgrower
organization, the Companies would Inform the Unions and
the Societies of their cane development plans. The SBCU
agricultural and cane transport activities would be phased
out and all outstanding debts due to SBCU would be audited
and arrangements made for their recovery or write off.
The SSO would relinquish all agricultural functions and
concentrate exclusively on settlement aspects. KSA would
adopt the role of advisor and arbitrator and assume its
statutory regulatory functions. A Sugar Belt Coordinating
Committee (SBCC) would be established. On labor
conditions, the SBCU, the Muhoroni Cooperative Union (MCU)
and unaffiliated societies would represent their members
collectively in dealing with KSA and the Factory
Companies. Cooperative staff would receive training.
(iII)     Finance SBCU loans would be audited and uncollectable
loans written off; a recovery effort would be made for
these end for SSO loans. On the financing ME, the
Project financing plan would be worked out between the
Bank and the Treasury. Government requested retroactive
financing effective from July 1977 in order to cover
expenditures on the program by companies during the
extended appraisal period. The Bank considered September
1977 or from the date of signing the Loan Agreement more
appropriate (in fact the date became from November 1,
1977).
2.05     A further meeting was held to discuss sugar pricing.  This was a
major issue because prices did not provide adequate incentives for either
growers or the factories. Government did not give a firm commitment.
Government was, however, already committed to real price increases under
the SONY project and it was confirmed at the meeting that a letter would
be sent to Washington on the pricing issue before Christmas 1977.
2.06     In the event, Government told the Bank that it considered there
was no case for the 6% increase in real cane prices in 1978 which was
stipulated in the SONY project. The Bank thus had a major issue on its
hands, In mid March 1978 the Regional Vice President chaired a meeting
to review the issue. It was decided that the consequences of the
Government pricing decision required detailed review. The implications



for the financial rate of return and the viability or otherwise of the
various project components had to be determined. It was stressed that
Bank analyses had to be incontrovertible as evidence of potential world
over supply was becoming available. In fact, the Board discussion of the
SONY project had linked the issue of pricing to that of the balance of
supply and demand; if Kenya were to become a net exporter, then prices
would have to come down or subsidies be paid. It was therefore agreed
that a desk study would be carried out in Washington followed by a
further field mission to discuss the basis of Government's decision and
its implications for the Project. Provided a satisfactory financial
basis for the project could be established, a revised appraisal report
would be prepared for submission to the Loan Committee.
2.07     A fourth mission, therefore, visited Kenya from April 10-25,
1978 and held extensive discussions with government on the main issues,
(a) cane and the ex-factory sugar prices, and (b) the balance between
production and demand. An aide memoire was submitted to Government
(April 28, 1978), and a second Decision Meeting was held in Washington on
May 12, 1978. The Bank agreed with the Government decision not to
increase sugar prices at that time and that the then current price of KSh
133/- per ton of cane was adequate. Agreements and mechanisms would be
developed during negotiations for joint reviews between the Bank and
Government regarding prices. The Appraisal Report would be updated on
this basis. Government would be formally advised of the decision and
also that the South Nyanza pricing clause in the Loan Agreement was not
in default. On the question of production and demand, it was agreed that
the likely exportable surplus as a result of the Project would be quite
small and would be caught up by consumption in time. However, a joint
mechanism would likewise be developed at negotiations, to review
investment and production plans. The Bank was concerned that Kenya
should not generate large surpluses for export, as price prospects for
export were poor. The necessary covenants would be included in the Legal
Documents.
Project Description
2.08     The Project as described in Appraisal report No. 1887-KE
November 17, 1978 was designed, over the six years 1979-84, to
rehabilitate and expand the sugar companies at Miwani, Chemelil, Muhoroni
and Ramisi, including the factories (with the exception of Chemelil), the
nucleus estatfs, outgrower cane areas and housing and transportation
infrastructure. The Project would increase the annual domestic
production of mill-white sugar, thus helping Kenya to reach
self-sufficiency in sugar in the early 1980's. Specifically, the Project
would comprise:
(a)   the establishment of run-of-the-river irrigation on 2,000
ha in Miwani, Chemelil and Muhoroni zones; the conversion
of 770 ha of irrigated rice area to irrigated sugarcane at
Ahero; and the rehabilitation of the existing irrigation
system for 370 ha and establishment of sprinkler
Irrigation frc-. a new dam for an additional 400 ha at
Ramisi;
(b)   Drainage for 15,000 ha of nucleus estate and outgrowers
land in the Sugar Belt;



- 5 -
(c)   Agricultural development, including the rehabilitation of
existing cane lands (12,000 ha) and establishment of new
cane areas (2,690 ha), improvements in cane harvesting and
transportation, and strengthening of the sugar companies'
agricultural research and training;
(d)   Rehabilitation and expansion by a total of 1,150 TCD of
the Miwani, Muhoroni and Ramisi sugar factories, and
training of factory staff;
(e)   Improvement of the companies' general management and
administration, mainly through the provision of equipment
and extra staff;
(f)   Infrastructure, including construction and maintenance of
roads and tracks, (a total of 678 km were involved) and of
staff housing and other facilities;
(g)   The strengthening of the National Sugar Research Institute
with equipment and personnel;
(h)   Studies and additional agricultural staff training to be
undertaken by the KSA.
2.09     During the investment period (Years 1-5) all incremental staff
salaries and agricultural and factory inputs and materials would be
capitalised and treated as project expenditures for funding purposes.
The Project would be executed by the respective sugar companies
(agriculture, factories, training, company research, minor roads and
tracks), the Ministry of Works (major roads), the Ministry of Agriculture
(national research), the National Irrigation Board (Ahero conversion) and
the Kenya Sugar Authority (drainage, irrigation, training, studies).
Aeements Reached_
2.10     In view of the project's complex nature and the long appraisal
cycle the number of agreements to be discussed during loan negoti.ions
In Nairobi in October, 1978 was considerable. The following important
agreements were reached (reference to Loan Agreement is shown in
pat nthesis):-
(a)   the on-lending of funds for factory rehabilitation and
expansion would be conditional upon review and approval by
KSA of the companies' factory rehabilitation plans;
(Sch 2, D)
(b)   the KSA would appoint consultants under terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank to (i) undertake
studies and (ii) review and approve the sugar companies'
factory rehabilitation plans;
(Sch 2, H and D[4])
(c)   Government would prepare a regional drainage development
plan for the Kano plains, acceptable to the Bank, before
December 31, 1981; (Sch 2, H[4]).



- 6 -
(d)   the Government would establish a Roads and Drainage
Maintenance Fund (RDMF) which KSA would administer; (4.07).
(e)   the Ministry of Labor would review the market for cane
harvest labor in collaboration with KSA and the labor
unions and prepare a plan, acceptable to the Bank, for
improvement in labor supply and in employment conditions
by December 31, 1979; (4.08).
(f) until December 31, 1988 Government would consult with the
Bank before making or promoting Investments in additional
sugar milling capacity in Kenya; (4.11).
(g)   sugarcane, ex-mill and sugar retail prices w'uld be
reviewed periodically in consultation with the Bank;
(4.10).
Detailed obligations of the companies were set out in the Loan Agreement,
and the Companies undertook to perform these obligations in separate
Letters of Agreement with the Bank.
2.11     Conditions of disbursements of Loan funds were:
(a)   the disbursement of any funds to an individual sugar
company would be conditional on effectiveness of an
agreement between Government and that company covering
investment and on-lending terms; and (Sch 1.4)
(b)   the disbursement of funds to Rauisi, Miwani and Muhoroni
companies would be conditional on the conversion into
equity of the existing parent company loan at Ramisi and
reserves at Ramisi, Niwani and Muhoroni (Sch 1.4).
2.12     In addition to the above important covenants, there were a
number of less important, project specific covenants, plus the regular
covenants on consultants, accounts, procurement etc. All covenants are
listed in detail in Annex 2. The plethora of legal undertakings led to
adverse comment at Board presentation and to difficulties in
implementation and supervision (para 7.05).
Costs and Financing
2.13     Total Project cost was estimated at KSh 1,104 million (US$138
million), of which about US$71.8 million or about 52Z represented foreign
exchange requirements. Total project cost is detailed below.

2.16     The IBRD Loan of US$72 million to GOK, to be repaid over 20
years, was to carry an annual interest rate of 7.35% and there was a
commitment charge of 0.75% per annum on the unwithdrawn balance. There
was a grace period of 51/2 years, the first payment falling due on
July 15, 1984 and the final payment on January 15, 1999. The loan would
be drawn down by the closing date of March 31, 1985.
2.17     GOK was to make the proceeds of the loan available to the sugar
companies at an interest rate of 101/2% per annum with a term of 20
years including 5 years grace for Miwani and Muhoroni and 8 years grace
in the case of Ramisi. The GOK was also to make available KSh. 27.2
million (USt3.4 million) to Muhoroni in exchange for shares and KSh. 14.4
million (US$1.8 million) to Ramisi in exchange for shares.

III. Project Implementation and Operating Performance
Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01     The original loan effectiveness date (March 20, 1979) was
extended twice, and the loan was not declared effective until September
20, 1979. Effectiveness was held up by the need to have effective
agreements with each of the companies; the legal opinions initially
provided by the companies' lawyers were not acceptable to the Bank's
Legal Department. The problem was resolved with the assistance of a
local law firm retained by the Bank's Nairobi office. The delay did not,
however, hold up the start of the Project, as equipment procurement for
Muhoroni proceeded and was eligible for retroactive financing (para
2.04). Selection of consultants for factory rehabilitation, road works,
drainage and irrigation also progressed. In any case Government made no
provision for the Project in the Esti.mates until the year beginning July,
1979, so that neither Government nor World Bank contributions could begin
to disburse until then.
3.02     Satisfying the conditions for disbursements from the loan as
mentioned in paragraph 2.11 above took much longer and ultimately only
those in respect of Muhoroni were finalised:
Muhoroni:   The company having converted KSh. 4 million of its
reserves into share capital in October 1979,
Government and the Bank agreed that this created a
satisfactory debt: equity ratio &nd that it was
unnecessary to convert the full amount of KSh. 23
million stated in the Loan Agreement (Schedule I
paragraph 4[d]). The Subsidiary Financing Agreement
(SFA) was signed in March 1980, with which the
Muhoroni component disbursement conditions were
fulfilled (15 months after the signing of the Loan
Agreement).
Mlwani:     All formalities including a debenture were completed
by June 1980 and Miwani signed the SPA. Government,
however, had begun to have doubts about on-lending
to private companies and never signed the SFA.
Ramisi:     Government's attitude towards on-lending to Ramisi
was even more negative. Not only was Ramisi a
private company, but Government had problems with
loan recoveries from the group to which Ramisi
belongs and was, through auditors and consultants,
endeavoring to assess Ramisi's assets and
liabilities position. The SFA was never signed.
Project Revision
3.03     In July 1980 a supervision mission identified Government's
hesitancy in entering into SFAs with Miwani and Ramisi but was unable to
obtain formal confirmation. Lack of the two SFAs blocked implementation
of the largest components of the project, and the Bank requested a formal
statement of the Government's position at a Country Implementation Review



- 10 -
(CIR) in January 1981. No clear response was received. Bank staff then
met with Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MOALD)
officials in March 1981 to express concern about this issue and to raise
other Important issues on Government policy which were then becoming
apparent; the issues Included policy on outgrowers; unprogrammed and
apparently uneconomic expansion of land under cane; prices for cane and
sugar; and lack of Project coordination.
3.04     Clearly Government's refusal to sign agreements with the private
sugar companies made most of the project unimplementable. In addition
the passage of time had brought to light important sugar sub-sector
issues that made prospects for the project very dim. In mid - 1981,
therefore, the Regional Vice President agreed with the Minister of
Agriculture the need to 're-formulate the project In an appropriate
sector policy context". Details of how the re-formulation was to be
achieved were agreed by January 1982: funds would not be passed to the
private companies; a sector strategy would be drawn up; and the project
would be reformulated and reappraised.  As a first step, at the Spring
1982 CIR, it was agreed that the Ramisi component should be scrapped and
that the fu7ds from the Bank loan allocated (US$ 30 million) should be
cancelled.1
3.05     During 1982, efforts were made by the Bank and KSA to draw up
the sector strategy and to reformulate the Project. Consultants
(financed under the SONY Project, Loan 1389-KE) studied sector issues and
a special committee set up by Government reviewed the sugar industry's
financial crisis. However, the Bank's offer to finance technical
assistance for project revision was not taken up at this stage, the
Government failed to come up with a comprehensive strategy for the sugar
sector and by mid - 1983 proposals for project re-formulation were still
inadequate as a basis for reappraisal. It was thus agreed, In August
1983, to shelve attempts to-agree a strategy and to reformulate the
project; instead Government9would request cancellation of US$ 58 million
(inclusive of the US$ 30 million allocated to Ramisi). This would reduce
the loan to US$ 14 million to finance a rump comprising a (reduced)
Muhoroni component and funds for technical assistance and for preparation
of an investment proposal for revise- sugar projects. Of the US$ 14
million, US$ 7 million had by that time either been spent or committed,
leaving a balanci of US$ 7 million.
3.06     Government made Its formal request on August 31, 1983 and the
remaining Loan balance, allocated as follows, was to be drawn down by
March 31, 1985:
1/       Even this proved problematic as Ramisi's' owners, with whom the
Bank had a Letter of Agreement, withheld their
counter-signature. The Legal Department subsequently advised
that cancellation by the Bank for cause (non-performance of
obligations) would not require a counter-signature by Ramisi.

Implementation Performance: Project Coordination
3.07     Overall, the Project performed far below expectations.  Early
supervision missions reported adequate project co-ordination by KSA and
MOALD but this was short lived due to staff changes in both KSA and
MOALD. It became clear in the course of implementation that MOALD and
KSA did not have the capacity in terms of manpower to co-ordinate a
project of this size involving about fifteen agencies. At a CIR held in
March 1982, the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Finance indicated
that projects of this type were difficult to Implement, partly because
they required difficult policy decisions, and partly because they were
complex. He suggested that in formulating and selecting projects ease of
implementation should be as important a criterion as economic and
financial rates of return and the skill compositlon of the Implementing
Ministry should be carefully assessed. Details of the activities which
MOALD/KSA were expected to either monitor or implement during the project
are listed in Annex 2 which also shows the status of each a. the close of
the Project. It can be seen that none of the Government's tasks were
achieved.
3.08     Financially, the Project suffered from budgetary constraints, as
no provision was made in the Estimates until 1979/80, and the provision
thereafter was consistently too low. This slowed down the rate of
implementation and resulted in cost increases.
Muhoroni: Development and Performance
3.09     Project Concept:  With the reduction of the Project scope as

described above the only active component was Muhoroni. Muhoroni started
production in 1966 with an insta'led capacity of 1,250 tons of cane per
day (TCD) which through various stages was increased to 1,800 TCD by
1978. (Appraisal assumed or estimated 2,000 TCD but the company has
disputed this figure ever since). Initially the Company was only
involved in milling cane and carried out no agricultural operations. The
cane was supplied by individual large scale farmers (40%) and the Sugar
Settlement Organization (SSO) (60%). Chemelil factory, established in
1968, absorbed some of the large scale farmer cane which was intended to
be replaced by cane from SSO. Subsequently, societies under the Sugar
Belt Cooperative Union (SBCU) were organized in 1973 to promote
smallholder production. Unfortunately neither the SSO nor the SBCU
societies achieved their targets due to organizational problems. Under
the Project, therefore, it was agreed that the Company would take a more
active role in cane production: cane production would be the
responsibility of an Agricultural Department, which was to be set up
within the Company. The Department would be responsible for
rehabilitating and developing a nucleus estate and outgrower lands. The
production objective was 630,000 tons cane per annum and to mill this the
factory would be expanded to 2,400 TCD. It was forecast at appraisal
that, apart from the Bank Loan and the Government contribution, the
Company would generate adequate funds from its own resources and have
access to short term loans (arranged by Government) to finance the
project. It was also assumed that cane and sugar prices would be
reviewed regularly in consultation with the Bank and adjusted as
necessary to ensure profits for both the farmers and the factory.
3.10     Project Description:  The Muhoroni component comprised:
irrigation on about 670 ha of the nucleus estate; improved drainage ov
1,340 ha; provision of vehicles and equipment for maintenance of roads
not maintained by Government; rehabilitation and supply of inputs on
2,200 ha of the nucleus estate (1,200 ha improved husbandry, 600 ha
reclaimed fallow land and 400 ha new land) and on 11,300 ha outgrowers
land (5,700 ha improved husbandry, 900 ha reclaimed fallow land and 4,700
ha new land); establishment of an Agricultural Department within the
Company with trained staff, vehicles and equipment; research on cane
husbandry; new and modified existing equipment for harvesting, loading,
transporting and unloading cane; increasing factory capacity to 2,400
tons cane per day; office machinery, equipment, furniture and additional
staff; and housing for 760 staff, and other common facilities such as a
dispensary, workers club, offices, storage and a garage.
3.11     Project Start-up:  First step in the Project program was to be
the creation of the Company's Agricultural Department to take over from
SSO and SBCU, and beginning of the agricultural development. However
start-up was delayed by shortage of funds. Although retroactive
financing had been agreed, the Company could not draw Loan funds until
March 1980 when the SFA became effective (para. 302). However, producer
price incentives were good in 1977-9, following a 27% price hike in May
1977, and this induced farmers to plant cane using their own resources.



- 13 -
This period of good cane availability coincided with favorable factory
margins for Muhoroni and the Company crushed record levels of cane.
Factory throughput rose from 241,293 tons it. 1977 to 444,415 tons (1978),
527,835 tons (1979) and 531,200 tons (1980). However, this phenomenon of
spontaneous planting was short-lived. Subsequently incentives to replant
and to tend ratoons dropped - in a boom and bust cycle resulting from
Government pricing policy, cane prices remained unaltered until April
1981. However, by this time the Company was beginning its own program.
It borrowed KSh. 10 million from Government and invested KSh. 50 million
from its own resources. Start-up was nonetheless slow - the Company
could only develop 1,000 ha annually, compared with a rate foreseen at
appraisal of 1,600 ha annually.
3.12     Agricultural Development and Performance:  Appraisal design
provided for improving existing and reclaiming fallow cane areas (8,400
ha) and developing new areas (5,100 ha). Of the total of 13,500 ha an
area of 670 ha on the nucleus estate was to be irrigated and 1,340 ha was
to have a new drainage system installed. The irrigation and the drainage
components were cancelled. Implementation of the remaining program
encountered a number of constraints:
Mi)     Land development was delayed:  Delays in securing Credit
effectiveness and satisfying disbursement conditions (para
3.11) were followed by lengthy procurement procedures
(para 4.05) and the constraint of limited allocations in
the Estimates (para 4.02). All this led to a long delay
in procurement of land preparation machinery, fertilizer
and pesticides, which were only procured in 1984. Because
of the delay, costs escalated, thereby limiting the area
that could be developed.
(ii)     Farmer motivation was poor:  In part, this was because of
the widespread problem of absentee farmers. The project
had provided for a survey by the SSO and a plan to tackle
this problem, but neither survey nor plan were ever
completed. More important were financial incentives for
cane production. Real producer prices fluctuated over the
Project period, quite good in 1977 but declining
thereafter (para 3.11) until a sharp price hike in 1983.
In general, cane was a profitable crop for farmer from
1983 but farmers have apparently differentiated between
cane planted with their own resources and project cane.
They maintain the former reasonably well but neglect the
latter because of the repayment deductions made at the
time of harvesting.
(ill)     There was a labor shortage at peak periods:  Labor
availability for weeding, cane cutting and other manual
tasks is a constraint. This problem was identified at
appraisal and a plan for improvement in labor supply and
in employment conditions was to be prepared (LA Section
4.08). The plan was prepared by MOL by November 1978 but
was not submitted to the Bank for review. Labor is still
a problem in the Muboroni zone.

(iv)     Rezoning deprlved Muhoroni of prime cane land:  The
rezoning of about 2,400 ha of high potential land deprived
Muhoroni of a prime source of cane in which It had already
invested and obliged it to develop less suitable lands as
a substitute.
(v)     Muhoroni lost money on land development:  Company costs
for cane development were higher than the rates fixed by
the KSA which co'tld be charged to the farmer. The Company
had to subsidise the difference, which (a) diminished its
motivation to develop land; and (b) contributed to the
Company's losses.
3.13     Within the above constraints, the Company managed to develop or
improve 7,024 ha against 13,500 ha foreseen at appraisal.L1 The
overall position of cane land improvement is shown In Table 4 and the
annual development with comparable appraisal figures is shown In Annex
4. After a drop in cane production from the 1980 peak of 531,200t
(para.3.11) to 391,283t (1981) and 330,500t (1982), the agrlculture
development program between 1983 and 1985 Is now showing results with
factory throughputs of 392,089 tons in 1983, 490,037 tons in 1984,
460,000 tons in 1985 and 550,000 tons estimated for 1986. However, the
scaling down of the factory component may have an unfortunate effect as
cane production is likely to be in excess of real factory capaeity.
Muhoroni has drawn up a plan for continued improvement of agricultural
practices and cane development. The plan which Is still under review aims
at having 1,850 ha on the nucleus estate and 12,089 ha on outgrowers
lands under cane to produce about 660,000 tons of cane and 62,700 tons
sugar (at 9.5% recovery) annually. Planting, maintenance and harvesting
programs for the nucleus estate and outgrovers' under this plan, and
projected cane availability from 1986 to 1992, are shown in Annexes 5, 6
and 7.
3.14     Factory Rehabilitation and Expansion  The planning of the
factory component started in October 1979 with an Invitation to
consultants to bid. Due to delays in bid evaluation and selection,
consultants (nine specialists) arrived only in January 1981 and completed
their survey by March 1981. The preliminary estimate for rehabilitation
and expansion to 2,400 tons of cane per day was US$ 14.3 million compared
with the amount in the Loan of US$ 2.0 million (1OOX foreign, 90X
local). As the cost far exceeded estimates and as the need for factory
expansion was not pressing (cane production was lagging), it was agreed
by KSA/Bank to carry out rehabilitation within the limited funds and to
review the case for expansion at a later date (probably 1984) when cane
production was expected to have picked up. Limited rehabilitation was
carried out to Improve effectiveness.
1/ WMuhoroni is continuing to implement the agricultural program with
own funds. By the Project Closing Date (March 31, 1985) a further
133 ha on the nucleus estate had been Improved and 10 ha new land
developed, bringing the total to 2,083 ha. On outgrowers land, 746
ha had been Improved and 16 ha of new land developed, bringing the
total to 5,846 ha.

3.15     The actual costs of the components undertaken compared with
appraisal estimates (Annex 11 Table 22) are shown below (Table 5). It
will be seen that there were substantial cost overruns in most factory
components. Consultancy fees in particular far exceeded the
provision.lL

3.16     During the Project period it was expected that the sugar to cane
ratio would rise to 10% due to improved factory and field operations.
The companys' cash generation and its contribution to project costs were
also based on this assumption. In fact the ratio has dropped (Table 6).
Sugar to cane ratio and poor capacity utilization are the two prime
causes of unprofitable sugar factory operations. Capacity utilization
was very high in 1984 and 1985, but the sugar to cane ratio dropped to
the unsatisfactory level of 8.3% (rule of thumb for profitable operation
is 10%). The cause of the drop was a combination of climatic conditions,
use of low sucrose cultivars and sub-optimal factory processing due to
restricted maintenance (long milling season, lack of finance and
spares). The adverse financial implications of the deteriorating ratio
were exacerbated during the Project period by an adverse movement in
factory "terms of trade" during 1979/85. The cane price rose by 103%
while the ex-factory sugar price rose by.only 78%. In addition, in
1984/5, cane quality declined further with harvesting of over-aged cane
and cane deliveries being bunched due to uncontrolled burning by
farmers. Annex 3 lists in abbreviated form the Muhoroni factory
performance from 1979/1985 (the final year is estimated).
3.17     There are two problems with the factory at present.  Low
efficiency has made operations unprofitable. Increasing production of
cane is outstripping factory capacity; if the Company goes ahead with
further agricultural development, factory expansion will be essential.
The Company has therefore prepared a factory rehabilitation and expansion
proposal designed to improve factory efficiency and to expand capacity to
cope up with increased cane production. The proposal is to carry out all
repairs and replacements and balance the various stations in the factory
to improve the technical performance. The crushing capacity would be
increased to 100 tons cane per hour. Field operations would be improved
to balance cane availability and delivery with factory capacity. Cane
varietal studies would be carried out and low yielding varieties would be
phased out. The objective would be to increase the polarity percentage
in cane by 1.75% and the sugar to cane ratio will increase to 9.5% by
1990. In effect, the Company proposal is to complete the Muhoroni
sub-project as originally proposed. It is understood that the cost of
carrying out essential repairs and increasing the factory capacity to
2400 TCD is about KSh 151 million (US$ 9.26 million) in December 1985
prices. However, it appears that rezoning of Muhoroni cane to nearby
Chemelil, which has excess capacity, is a feasible alternative to
expansion at Muhoroni. But even with rezoning, rehabilitation to improve
efficiency is essential if Muhoroni is to break even.
3.18     Housing  A firm of architects to complete designs for the
housing component was appointed in August 1980 in accordance with Bank
procedures. The estimated costs exceeded the funding availability ($ 4.0
million, of which 90% from the Bank loan). No provision was made in the
1981-3 Estimates for the component and when funds were re-allocated in
1983 the housing component was scaled down and the Bank allocation
reduced to US$ 1.05 million from the original US$ 3.6 million. The
reduced component was successfully implemented within the revised funding
envelope. The items completed and their costs compared with appraisal
estimates (Annex 10 Tables 7 and 8) are shown in Table 7.

3.19     Other Components  The irrigation, drainage and road maintenance
components were not implemented. The consultants, hired in 1980 to
prepare detailed irrigation plans, estimated the costs at about US$ 4.5
million. The cost was agreed to be too high to justify the investment
economically and financially, in any case, Bank funding of US$ 1.3
million, supposed to cover 90% of the cost, was inadequate and neither
Muhoroni nor Government wished to increase their contribution. It was
therefore agreed to drop the component and transfer the funds to
agricultural development, where the economic and financial returns
justified it. The drainage component which was to be undertaken by
Government, was held in suspense pending a decision on the Miwani
Sub-project (para. 3.03). Consultant studies showed costs well in excess
of appraisal estimates (US$ 16.9 million, whereas the amount in the Loan
was US$ 6.4 million, 90% of costs). The component was deleted.
Muhoroni, however, carried out some minor drainage works on the nucleus
estate. Consultants prepared rehabilition and maintenance proposals for
roads, which again were much more costly than appraisal estimates. The
consultants estimated the cost of establishing and operating one Road
Construction Unit for the sugar belt roads alone at US$ 6.3 million
whereas the allocation in the loan for all roadworks was US$ 2.5 million
(50% financing). Government never made a provision in Estimates for this
program, the Roads and Drainage Maintenance Fund (RDMF) was not
established and no road works were implemented.
3.20     Overall Implementation  From the above it will be apparent (i)
that engineering works were underestimated at appraisal; and (ii) that
reduction in the scope of the Muhoroni sub-project was effected during
implementation within available financing. Actual investments were less
than foreseen in the revised loan agreement as follows (see Annex 10 for
full details):-

IV. Project Costs, Disbursements, Procurement
Costs
4.01     The Project at closure was very different from that which was
appraised during 1977/78. As discussed in Chapter Three (para. 3.03 ff),
an amount of US$ 58 million was cancelled In August 1983 and a further
US$ 1.2 million at closure in October 1985. There were considerable cost
escalations in other components which led to reductions of physical
implementation within existing financing (para. 3.20). Overall the
appraisal base cost estimates were over-optimistic, price contingencies
were lower than actual price inflation and implementation delays led to
further disparity between appraisal and actual cost. A summary of
project costs is given in Table 8; total cost was KSh. 182.7 million (US$
14.7 million).
Disbursements
4.02     Delays in achieving effectiveness and satisfying the conditions
for disbursement resulted In the initial transfer of funds being much
slower than anticipated at appraisal. This was compounded by
Government's unwillingness, throughout the Project period, to make
adequate provision in the Estimates. Within these constraints, this was
true even when the Project was scaled down to a fraction of its former
size in 1983, at which time the World Bank funds accounted for 90% of
funding and the Company provided the balance (i.e. there was no net coat
to Government). The Company prepared withdrawal applications and KSA
processed them without delay. However, there was often a long delay in
MOALD and Treasury before the applications reached the Bank. There were
also delays in Treasury repaying Muhoroni after the Bank had paid
applications. A proposed system of quarterly advance payments never
worked. All these problems created cash flow problems for the Company
and delayed project implementation. Claims were properly documented.
4.03     Despite these hitches, the revised allocation to the Muhoroni
components was almost completely disbursed. An undisbursed balance of
only US$ 82,000 was cancelled. The "residual' component to be
implemented by the Government - the investment proposals - never got off
the ground and the US$ 1 million left in the Loan in August 1983 for this
specific purpose, together with US$ 115,000 for other items, were
cancelled. The total amount cancelled from the reduced balance,
therefore, was just under US$ 1.2 million bringing the total amount
cancelled from the original Loan of US$ 72 million to US$ 59.2 million
(82.2%).
4.04     Government paid over US$ 2.4 million to the Bank in commitment
fees, much of which was run up during the period 1980-3 when Government
and Bank were trying to reach agreement on cancellation of the bulk of
the loan (para. 3.04 ff). Table 9 shows the interest and service
paymeats made by Government on the loan up to the closing date, October
7, 1985, when the final disbursement was made.

Proc-urement
4.05     The Company was poorly briefed on Bank procurement requirements,
and KSA and Bank staff had to spend much time ensuring that guidelines
vere followed, with inevitable delays. In some instances rebidding was
required, resulting in cost escalation. A reimbursement problem
regarding fertilizer which had been purchased from a Government agency
and which had been originally supplied under an aid program toot a long
time to resolve. The issue was whether double financing was involved or
not. The Bank finally reimbursed but the Company's cash flow position
was tight in the meantime. This prevented the purchase of further
fertilizer supplies which were necessary.

V. Financial Performance
5.01     Project Investments.  At appraisal it was expected that
expansion of the factory at Muhoroni from about 2000 tcd to 2400 tcd,
additional agricultural development on 13,500 ha and related investments
in management, roads and housing would cost KSh 308 million ($38.5
million), of which KSh 171 million ($21.4 million) was to be financed by
the World Bank, KSh 21 million ($2.6 million) by Government and KSh 114
million ($14.3 million) by EASI from retained earnings.L/ The actual
project implemented was very much reduced and comprised only a limited
rehabilitation of the factory, additional agricultural development on
7,024 ha and a small housing development. The irrigation, drainage,
management and roads components were not implemented. The cost of the
actual project was KSh 171 million ($13.9 million), financed by the World
Bank KSh 151 million ($12.2 million) and EASI KSh 20 million ($1.6
million). The physical and cost estimates and actual realisations are
shown in detail in Annex 10.
5.02     Project Production.  It is estimated that Project investments
have resulted in an increase of production at Muhoroni compared with
appraisal estimates as follows:
(tons '0008)
SAR --    -------- Actual/Forecast --------
% of            % of
Cane   Sugar   Cane   Appraisal   Sugar Appraisal
1. Extra production
Total PYl-7 (1979-85) 1,006  100      521    (52)          45      (45)
2. Average annual
production PY9-25       365    36     259    (71)          22      (61)
(1987-2003)
Project production has thus achieved 45% of appraisal estimates and is
expected to sustain about 61% of appraisal estimates in the future. The
shortfall is due to the smaller than anticipated agricultural development
and declining factory outturn.
5.03     Financial Rate of Return.  The financial flows relating to this
reduced level of investment and reduced level of production have been
calculated on broadly the same assumptions as at appraisal (see detailed
table and notes in Annex 8.4 "Project Costs and Revenues").
1/       These figures are drawn from Annex 10, based on SAR Annex 15,
table 25. They include estimated apportionment of certain
project costs (e.g. drainage) and differ slightly from the
information in other parts of the project documents (e.g.
Schedule 1 of the LA which shows total Bank financing for
Muhoroni of $ 19.2 million).



- 25 -
The financial rate of return to the Company on project investments is
estimated at 2% if productioa forecasts hold good, if the present
(1984/85) price and cost relationships are maintained, and if present
factory outturn levels are maintained. This return compares with 24%
estimated at appraisal, unfavorably because of lower overhead recovery,
higher operating costs, less favorable cane/sugar price ratios and lower
factory outturn than estimated at appraisal.
5.04     Returns to Outgrowers.  The above return takes payments to
outgrowers as a proxy for cane production costs, following appraisal
methodology. An analysis of project financial flows taking Company
outgrower service costs and the imputed value of outgrower labor as a
proxy for cane production costs gives a rate of return of 18%.I/
Although this overstates the FRR as it excludes the cost of land rent and
any direct non-labor farmer costs, it gives a rough measure of the
financial profitability of the project investments for the farmer. An
investment that from the Company's viewpoint is unable to generate
adequate cash flow to service project-related debt becomes from the
viewpoint of the farmer attractive (so long as the present cost/revenue
relationship holds).
5.05     Returns to Government.  Government has collected 1981-5 about
KSh 58 million in duty and levy on project production and is projected to
collect a further KSh 516 million over the life of t' project. If this
taxation is counted as part of project financial revt^aes, the return to
the project becomes 21%. As for the farmer, so for the Government the
project is likely to prove more profitable than for the Company.
5.06     EASI Financial Position.V/  At appraisal it was estimated that
Company Project and non-Project activities would generate sufficient cash
to allow the company itself to finance KSh 114 million (S14.3 million) of
project investments and to service KSh 126 million (*15.8 million) of
debt contracted to implement the project. It was forecast that, in 1989,
the debt to equity ratio would be an acceptable 24:76, and that the
Company would have a net worth of KSh 195 million ($24.4 million). In
fact, the Company has lost money every year since 1981 (KSh 61 million
1981-4) and is projected to continue to turn in small losses unless one
or other of the basic parameters of operations changes. As a result the
Company is likely to have a net worth of only KSh 106 million ($6.6
million) in 1989. The debt to equity ratio was a barely satisfactory
41:59 at last balance sheet date (1984) and is projected to deteriorate
to an unsatisfactory 56:44 In 1989. In practice, therefore, the Company
could not have financed 37% of project investments as had been foreseen
at appraisal. In the event, the Company financed only 12% of a much
reduced project.
1/ This is a rough and ready approach to give an order of magnitude
only. Farm budgets to allow more precise analysis were not available.
2/ See Annexes 8.2 and 8.3.



- 26 -
5.07     The Company's Cost/Revenue Structure and Operating Performance,
The reasons for the bad financial performance of the Company during the
Project period can be summarized under three headings (See Annex 8.1):
(M)     unfavorable'6ovement in the input: output price
structure. `The Company slice of the cake got smaller as
the farmers' and Government's got bigger. It was assumed
at appraisal that the sugar price would remain at 21 times
the cane price. In fact by 1985 it had dropped to a
multiple of 18.
(ii)     drop in factory outturn.  It was assumed at appraisal that
the sugar/cane ratio would stay at 10%. In fact by 1985,
it had dropped to 8.3%. As a result of this, and of
factor (i), cane cost accounted for 64Z of sales revenue
against 46% estimated at appraisal.
(iiI)     low overhead recovery.  At appraisal it was assumed that
by 1985 sugar sales would reach 62,000 tons of sugar
annually and that fixed costs would represent only 21% of
sales revenue. In fact fixed costs were 302 of sales
revenue in 1985. This is partly owing to the lower
turnover (39,000 tons of sugar sold), partly owing to
higher overheads. The main factor in the latter was the
rise in the level of "unabsorbed outgrower expenses".
Unabsorbed expenses are the differences between the rates
set by KSA at which the Company can recover from
outgrowers the cost of services and the actual cost of
providing those services (see para. 3.12 (v)). Unabsorbed
expenses in 1984 totalled KSh 11.5 million or 21Z of fixed
cost.
5.08     Conclusion.  The Project is capable of generating adequate
financial flowsto service and repay project debt and provide an adequate
profit for growers and the Company. However the terms of trade set by
Government control of input and output prices have become unfavorable to
the Company; as a result the Company's Project investments are not
profitable and overall the Company is likely to continue to lose money.
Contributory factors in these losses are inefficiency in field and
factory operations and the resulting high cost of providing outgrower
services and low factory outturn.  To some extent the scaling down of the
Project is the cause of the factory inefficiencies as the investments
needed to maintain factory efficiency were only partly made. A short
term solutlon to the Company's financial problems would be to restore a
more favorable input/output price relationship and to raise outgrower
change rates. In the medium term action to reduce costs and increase
yields Is essential and will require further investment.

VI, Project Impact
6.01     Sugar Production Forecasts:  In 1976, when the project was
identified, the annual output of the existing five factories was 167,000
tons of sugar. Annual Imports to satisfy consumption had been running at
205,000 tons. In the absence of investment, it was projected that the
deficit would rise to 233,000 tons by 1985 and 355,000 tons by 1990. The
on-going investment program (new projects at Nzoia and SONY and the
extension of Mumias) would still leave a shortfall of 25,000 tons in 1985
and 97,000 tons by 1990.   The present Project was to provide an annual
incremental production of 103,000 tons by 1985 (therefore a surplus of
78,000 tons) and 1J09,000 tons by 1990 (a surplus of 12,000 tons). As
uncertainties surrounded sugar production in Kenya, and there would be a
shortfall without the Projects it was assumed that the Project's output
would largely replace imports. In the event that exportable surpluses
were consistently produced, no particular problem was foreseen as Kenya's
cost of production of sugar was close to the Bank's projection of the
export parity price for 1985 and no problem was anticipated in disposing
of the surpluses to neighboring countries and other markets. A note of
caution was sounded, however, regarding any additional new factories
which would generate structural surpluses which would turn Kenya Into a
regular and sizable exporter - a clause was Incorporated in the Loan
Agreement whereby Government would report to the Bank on projected demand
and production by December 31, 1979, and annually thereafter, with
anticipated investments and plans for the marketing of sugar. (This
clause, 4.11, was violated throughout the project). In practice,
however, the forecasts of production have varied widely from
expectations. Aggregate production far exceeded projectious In 1979-81,
resulting in cnnsiderable exports in 1980 and 1981. Thereafter,
production levelled off well below forecast levels and Kenya resumed
sugar imports in 1984. Details of sugar production, consumption, imports
and exports 1974/85 are shown In Table 10.
6.02     Project Objectives:  The primary direct objectives of the
Project were to increase production of sugar and to reduce sugar
imports. Better use of existing facilities would increase economic
returns on existing investments. The Project's beneficiaries would be
primarily the Government, the owners of Miwani and Ramisi, a number of
large cane producers and some 10,800 smallholder producers. About 1,080
persons would gain employment and a large proportion of existing
employees would enjoy better living conditions. Taking into account the
value of foreign exchange savings through import substitution of the
sugar produced under the Project, the Government's foreign exchange
balance was expected to improve by KShs 617.9 million (US$ 77e2 million)
during the six year development period. Annual net foreign exchange
savings after debt service payments were expected to be [Shs 250 million
(US$ 31.3 million) in year 8 (expressed in constant 1978 prices) and to
increase thereafter. The 10,800 smallholders would achieve average net
returns of KShs 2,400/ha per year and those at Muhoroni were expected to
achieve KShs 2,770/ha per year.

6.U3     Impact on Sugar Production:  The Project was cut down
considerably (paragraphs 3.03-3.06), leaving only the Muhoroni and some
small Government components. As a result the production objectives will
never be attained - production is forecast to increase by only 22,000
tons a year against 109,000 tons forecast at appraisal. Some improvement
In outgrower incomes will be achieved at Muhoroni, but the Company has
lost, and will continue to lose money on the Project. Overall, the four
companies (and the sugar industry) remain essentially in the same state
(or worse) as when the project was mooted in 1976. It can be seen from
Table 10 that Miwani production in 1985 was lower than it was in 1974 and
55% of what was achieved in 1978. Ramisi production in 1985 was the same
as the production achieved in 1974 and 1978. Even Muhoroni, the only
production component to be Implemented, produced less in 1985 than It had
in the three boom years before implementation began. Production from the
Muhoroni component is expected to be sustained at about 61Z of appraisal
estimates. In addition a certain amount of housing and infrastructure
has been improved and the factory was partly rehabilitated (but
throughput was not increased). These are lasting beneficial effects of
the project but very small in relation to the ambitious targets set at
the outset. In addition, almost US$ 1 million has been spent on
fruitless studies. KShs 11.3 million (US$ 0,9 million) was spent on
consultancy work for roads, KSA, topographical surveys and drainage, the
results of which have not been utilized.

V1I. Institutional Performance and Development
7.01     KSA:  The bulk of the Government components were to be carried
out by KSA-ut performance has been poor (para. 3.07). Although it was
agreed that the consultants to KSA (originally financed under Loan
1389-KE, SONY) would be financed under this project until 1984 and KShs
5.6 million (US$ 0.45 million) were spent, KSA has not been effectively
strengthened. A bill to give more authority to KSA, originally drafted
in 1981, has not been prqsented to parliament and it seems unlikely that
this will ever be done.Y. It appears in fact that KSA's budget is
being reduced and that the institution plays no central role in planning
or decision-taking for the subsector. Proposals submitted by KSA are not
taken up and as a result staff morale is low. Yet the sugar industry
sorely needs a body to plan and coordinate policy, and part of the
failure of this Project must be attributed to the weakness of the KSA.
The reader is referred to Chapter 3 of the South Nyanza Sugar Project
Completion Report (Ln. 1389-KE) (paragraphs 3.24-26) for full discussion
of this issue.
7.02     Farmers Organization:  The Cooperative Societies and Unions were
to be an integral part of the outgrowers organization. They were to be
reviewed, their debt position rationalized and MOCD was to provide
assistance and training to enable them to meet their obligations under
the Project. Nothing could be traced as having taken place in this
regard and the field mission found that the societies/unions were of
little assistance to the farmers or the Company. The labor survey was
carried out but was never submitted to and reviewed by the Bank (para.
3.12 (iii)). Labor is still a problem in the Muhoroni zone.
7.03     Muhoroni:  Sugar company institutional development was catered
for under the Project by components providing for study tours under
factory company and KSA auspices and by the establishment of an industry
training center. In practice only Muhoroni implemented a training
program. The Company on its own resources, established a training center
and during 1978-85 conducted a variety of training courses for their
staff and for outgrover farmers, and sent officers on overseas courses.
The Company was reinforced by extra staff and equipment paid out of the
Loan Account. In general, the Company has been well managed and has been
strengthened by its own efforts and by Project support.
7.04     Research:  The proposed reinforcement of the National Sugar
Research Institute at Kibos and the establishment of an industry training
centre was never implemented. Sugar research and training nationally
still remains at an unsatisfactory low level.
1/     An announcement quoted in the local press on February 13, 1986 by
the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock Development states that
the Bill will not be presented.



- 31 -
7.05     Coplilance with Legal Covenants:  Although MOALD and KSA were
constantly reminded by supervision missions (and during Country
Implementation Reviews) of obligations under the legal agreements, a
large number of covenants were violated. These are listed in Annex 2.
The number of covenants were considered by one of the Bank's Executive
Directors to be excessive (para. 2.12) both in relation to Government's
implementation capacity and to the Bank's supervision capability. In the
event some covenants were not observed because they were redundant, while
others were not observed because they tried to legislate for resolution
of basic subsector issues on which Government and Bank had never agreed.
The number of violations therefore comes as no surprise.



- 32 -
VIII. Bank Performance
8.01     Unresolved Issues:  Project appraisal took two years because of
the numerous complex and contentious issues. The agreements reached
during negotiations were correspondingly numerous, resulting -n an
extensively detailed Loan Agreement. These numerous covenants were
expected to resolve major issues, including general policy issues (e.g
Government's willingness to lend Bank funds to private companiAs), sector
issues (e.g. sugar price levels, lack of a sector development policy,
lack of an institutional mechanicism for sector coordiaation), and
project issues (e.g. poor management capability, numerous weak
institutions like cooperatives with ill-defined roles in the project,
underestimates of costs, labor availability). The question must be asked
whether, in fact, the agreements reached at negotiations reflected
genuine resolution of issues or whether they were largely nominal
agreements which would allow the Project to go ahead. In view of the
fact that the Project foundered on these same issues and that most
covenants were either breached or lapsed, it is difficult to avoid the
conclusion that the covenants "papered over" substantial unresolved
issues and differences of opinions. Yet all these issues were adequately
identified and debated; only the obvious conclusion was not drawn - that
the Project and the sugar subsector were not ready for this investment,
8.02     Cancellation Delays:  After supervision missions identified real
implementation problems as early as July 1980 (18 months after signing
and only 9 months after effectiveness) an inordinate delay took place
before the Project was revised (end August 1983). Although the Bank made
efforts to sustain a dialogue during this three year period, it had a
difficult task in bringing this dialogue to the logical conclusion - that
the Project was unimplementable in view of the unresolved issues and
should be cancelled. The time taken to reach agreement on this
conclusion (three years) was long, and costly for Government in
commitment fees. The Bank has to be faulted for not sustaining this
dialogue more forcefully or focussing it better, so as to achieve a more
rapid cancellation. Even the August 1983 revision contained some wishful
thinking: Government made no headway on the investment proposals for a
revised project and a further US$ 1.2 million had to be cancelled.
8.03     Supervision:  Supervision missions were regular at the
commencement of the Project. During 1982/83, while revision or
cancellation was under discussion, no field supervision was carried out
but much time was spent on preparing and pursuing the dialogue with
Government. Total supervision input is estimated at 587 man days but the
results were disproportionately small as most of the time was spent in
preparing the obsequies of the project.
8.04     Disbursements.  Disbursements were handled promptly by the Bank
when claims were received. There were, however, delays in claims being
processed by MOALD and the Treasury and by the latter in reimbursing
Muhoroni. This created cash flow problems for the Company and delayed
implementation (paragraph 4.02 ft).

IX. Economic Rate of Return
9.01     Economic Rate of Return.  The economic rate of return to the
project is expected to be 3%, compared with a rate of 35X foreseen at
appraisal. The methodology of the calculation was that used at appraisal
and is detailed in annex 9.
9.02     Contrast with the Financial Analysis.  The med'ocre economic
rate of return contrasts with the more buoyant picture given by the
financial analysis where financial returns to the project as a whole
(benefiting Company, farmers and Government) are in excess of 20%. The
major difference between the financial and economic analysis lies in the
valuation of benefits. In the case of the financial analysis these were
valued at prevailing and anticipated domestic sugar prices. In the
economic analysis they were valued at the historical and forecast import
parity price, consistent with standard practice for economic analysis.
The arguments for alternative approaches are well made in the recent
Project Completion Report for the Kenya South Nyanza Sugar Project - SONY
(Loan 1389 KE), paragraph 9.03, and need not be repeated here.
9.03     The Economic Lesson.  A simple sensitivity analysis shows what
might have been. The sugar to cane ratio used in the projections of
revenue is 8.5% (latest actual was slightly lower, 8.3%). This is very
low by industry standards - 10% was assumed at appraisal, 11% is achieved
by EASI's competitor estate at Mumias. If a 10% rate were achieved
"costlessly " the rate of return would be 10% . If an 11% rate were
achieved, the rate of return would be 12%. Although these figures are
overestimates - they assume costless improvements in efficiency and an
agricultural potential that EASI may not possess - they do nevertheless
Indicate some of the lost potential of this project, and some of the
potential of the sugar industry in Kenya. The lesson is clear, however:
that if the economic rate of return is the key determinant of future
investment in sugar in Kenya, then only the most efficient producers with
low costs and high field and factory yields should invest, and a rigorous
study of regional/company comparative advantage should precede any
further investment.
9.04     Contrast with SONY.  The SONY project is expected to yield a
negative economic return, by contrast to the positive -albeit low - rate
of return of the present Project. The major lifferences are two. First,
SONY project costs were much higher as a new production unit was being
set up, whereas the present project comprised only Improvement and
marginal expansion of an existing unit. Second, the operating efficiency
of Muhoroni has been comparatively greater, as factory capacity
utilisation is projected to be nearly 100%, against an anticipated 50% at
SONY. SONY operates in a marginal production area where outgrower
production has not been forthcoming to the extent anticipated, whereas
Muhoroni operates in the heart of the sugar belt, under comparatively
favorable conditions and under pressure from competing factories. These
factors would suggest greater advantage in improvement and rehabilitation
of existing estates with potential rather than any new ex,ansion.



- 34 -
X.  SumMry and Conclusions
10.01    Five basic flaws in the Project are apparent.  First, it seems
that Government gave lower priority to rehabilitation than to the
construction of new factories. The Bank had a different perception of
relative priorities and favoured rehabilitation before new construction.
There was thus a fundamental lack of agreement between Bank and
Government on the priority to be given to the Project.
10.02    Second, there were a number of basic policy issues that were
never resolved. Appraisal took two years and required four separate
missions because of the large number of unresolved issues (par&. 8.01).
In the absence of political will on the part of Goverament to solve these
Issues, the Bank insisted upon namerous covenants in an attempt to tie
Government down to specific solutions. These covenants caused delays in
achieving effectiveness, because the sugar companies, KSA and Government
could not appreciate and fully understand the legal and financial
requirements of the Loan Agreement. Folloving loan effectiveness,
Government began to back away from its commitments, reflecting the
fundamental differences of perception between Bank and Government. The
first such action was a volte face in Government policy regarding the
provision of funds to private companies. Most of the Project proved
unimplementable because of this problem, and a painful and costly process
of cutting down the Project was begun. It took three years to recast the
Project and negotiate a cancellation of US$ 58 million. The delays In
decision making cost the Government US$ 2.4 million in commitment fees.
At the same time lack of resolution of major sectoral policy issues - on
cane and sugar pricing levels, sector development policy, mechanism for
sector coordination - reduced the potential contribution of the remaining
components.
10.03    Third, Government did not have the institutional mechanlsm to
coordinate and Implement What was in fact a multi-project rehabilitation
program loan. The Sugar Companies themselves were probably capable of
implementing their own sub-projects, but overall planning, formulation of
development policy, reconciliation between policy issues and
implementation was never achieved as no strong institution was
responsible for sugar policy or for the project. KSA made an effort but
had no authoritative power; It was in any case in a development stage
itself and there was inadequate staff (both in numbers and experience) In
MOALD.
10.04    Fourth, Project costs were underestimated and the Project was
therefore underfunded. In the event, even the funding that was to be
provided by the one company that implemented a sub-project never
materialized as unfavorable movements in pricing policy and declining
sugar factory efficiency resulted in operating losses, not profits.
Finally, the implementation period coincided with the Government
budgetary crisis of 1981-84 and even the greatly reduced level of
resources allocated to the rump of the project could not all be fitted
into the Estimates when required.



- 35 -
10.05    The fourth and fifth flaws - underestimates of costs and
Government budgetary problems were common to other projects appraised in
the Region at the time. Unanticipated levels of price inflation combined
with less rigorous Bank practices in cost estimates at the appraisal
stage caused cost estimates to be too low.
10.06    The Muhoroni Sugar Factory component has only been partially
successful. Appraisal estimates for irrigation, drainage, road
me,intenance and the increase of the factory capacity were too low and
Government could not provide funds to bridge the financing gap. As a
result these components of the Muhoroni sub-project were not completed.
Agricultural development was delayed and at the closing date only 88% of
the appraisal estimates on the nucleus estate and 45% on outgrowers lands
had been achieved. The part of the program which was implemented is
however now showing results.
10.07    Major lessons from the project experience may be summarized as
follows:
(a)   The lack of agreed priorities and a clear strategy for
sugar development in Kenya led to a shaky policy
foundation for the Project. The pragmatic solution
adopted by the Bank of trying to support two project (the
Sugar Rehabilitation and SONY Projects) with quite
different characteristics failed. Both projects have been
poor performers. Agreement between Government and the
Bank on investment priorities and strategy is a
prerequisite for successful investment.
(b)   Failure to resolve basic issues led to an unwieldy number
of covenants, to many of which Government had no
commitment. The use of covenants to paper over
inconsistencies or disagreements on policy places undue
strain on the legal documents and inevitably leads to
breaches of covenants. Resolution of basic sub-sector
issues should precede appraisal.
(c)   The project was very complicated, with fifteen
implementing agencies whose roles were not always clearly
defined. Overly complex design placed too great a burden
on weak executing agencies.
(d)   Underestimated quantities and prices during technical
preparation and appraisal resulted in 'cost overruns".
Physical implementation consequently fell short of
appraisal targets. Greater precision of physical
estimates is now provided by Bank rulings on the level of
engineering necessary prior to Board presentation. Price
level changes remain difficult to forecast accurately.



- 36 -
(e)   The project required a great degree of administrative
support and coordination. KSA could have handled this but
its role was never properly defined and It lacked skilled
manpower and authority to do the job. Greater attention
to the role of sub-sector management and the need for a
coordinating institution in a rehabilitation program loan
is indicated.
(f)   If subsector issues, particularly coordination and pricing
are resolved, properly manageed sugar production in high
potential areas could be a profitable and economically
justified activity in Kenya. Investment in rehabilitation
of existing estates and factories with potential would
probably yield satisfactory returns, but expansion of area
or the creation of new factories would not.

NOTES TO "ECONOMIC ANALYSIS"
As at appraisal, 100% of the cost of productive investment and
housing has been considered.
As at appraisal, benefits have been valued at the import parity
price, as Kenya remains a sugar deficit country.
As at appraisal, an imputed value for production foregone on the
newly developed area has been calculated on the basis of the maize
producer price (used as proxy for export parity price) and assumed 60%
occupancy rate (1142 ha x 60% x 2.2 t). Prices: KSh 954 in 1980 to KSh
1730 in 1984 and KSh 1900 in 1985.
As at appraisal a shadow exchange rate of KSh 11.0 - $1.00 was
used for foreign exchange elements 1977-82. Thereafter a rate of KSh
16.0 = $1.00 was used.
As at appraisal, labor was not shadow priced for the reasons
evoked at the time of appraisal.
Values are in constant 1983 terms.

Dear Mr. Donaldson,
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT: SUGAR REHABILITATION
PROJECT.
I refer to your unreferenced letter of 24th April, 1987.
1 have given the draft to the principal authorities in
Government involved with the project and I would like to
send on their Doint comments.
The project was an unfortunate one and much of what is
in the report is correct, and I would like to thank you
for your efforts at drawing out the lessons we have learned
from the failure of this project.  I do agree however, with
the comments sent by operating the project that not all the
blame should be placed cr. Government. I hope you will
incorporate these points to ensure we have balanced project
completion report.
Yours Sincerely,
CA.S. MbiSRE   ESR
PERM4ANENT SECRETARY SEASURY.
