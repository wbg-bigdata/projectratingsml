FO AN URTCORRIDOR P.ROWET--
1.     The following memorandum and reccum endation on a proposed
development credit to the Repullc of Bolivis for SDR 28.3 million (US$ 37.Q
million equivalent) is submitted for approval.  The proposed credit would be
on standard terms mith 40 years of maturity and would help to finance an
export corridors project.  The project is part of a program expected to be
co-financed by IDB vith a loan of about US$38 million.
2.       Backgroundt After Bolivia's economic crisis and hyperinflation of
1980-85, the stabilization and adjustment program introduced by the new
administration in 1985 has restored order in fiscal management and slowed
inflation. However, the hoped-for response from, the private sector to boost
non-traditional exports has yet to gain momentum. A major probltm is that
transportation to potential markets is costly and unreliable. Actions are
needed to inprove the road and rail lnfrastructure, make the transport and
terminal operations more efficient, and slmplify documentatioi. This is all
the more urgent because foreign exchange earnings from'natural gas,
Bolivia's principal export in 1988, are expected to drop after,ltf9, when
the present contract with Argentina expires. Zmplementation;of an August
1988 agreement to sell gas to Brazil instead is still uncertain. The
prtmitive state of transport In eastern Bolivia Is one factor that threatens.
to delay implemensatAton of that agreement.
3.       Rationale-for IDA Involvement:  IDA strongly supports the
Governent's economic program and its efforts to promote non-traditional
exports.. Participation in the project will enable IDA to play a major role
in addressing one of the main obstacles to export growth, the lack of.
adequate infrastructure and efficient, reliable service in th, principal
transport corridors.  IDA is currently financing spare parts for SNC {the
National Roads Authority) and ENFE (the National Railway Company) under two,
Reconstruction Import Credits (RICs) (FY86 sad FY87), as well as labor-
intensive road maintenance under two credits to the Emorgency Social Fund
(ESP) (FY87 and FY88). The project would build on the experience gained
through these projects.
4.       Project Obiectivess The project consists of major aowponents of a
program which atms to promote Bolivia's exports and reduce the costs of its
foreign trade by: (a) providing two well-functioning corridors by 1992-3,
one to the Atlant,ic and one to the Pacific; (b) strengthening railway
management to make it more market-oriented; (e) Improving road and rail
maintenance; (d) strengthening the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MTC) in'planning and policy-making; and (e) facilitating the
use of containers and airfreight.                             -
5.       Project Description:  The program components to be fiwnaced by IDA
fall into three groups: improvements to the corridor from La Paz to-the
Pacific, to the corridor from Santa Cruz to the Paraguay River and BE xi2_%
and to the transport system as a whole. Specifically, in the Pacific    ,
corridor, it comprises:  (a) deferred maintenance (asphalt concrete overlay)



-2-
on the La Pas-Oruro highway (228 km), and construction supervision (482 of
project cost); (b) a feasibility study and detailed enginiering for the
Patacamayya-Tambo Quemado road, which would complete the.-Bolivian portion of
the La Paz-Arics (Chile) highway (refinancing of a PPF - 1X of project
cost); (e) minor track Improvements on the La Pas-Arica rail line and at
the La Paz rail freight terminal (31 of project cost). The Atlantic
corridor improvements (20% of project cost) comprises (d) rehabilitation of
track and replacement of two bridges on the Santa Cruz-Corumba (Brazil)
railway line, (e) conversion of boxcars to multiple use on ENFE$s Eastern
network, and (f) construction of a new freight terminal in Santa Cruz. The
system-wide improvements comprise: (g) maintenanee works and drainage
improvements on the main road and rail export routes, to be carried out by
labor-intensive small contracts through the ESF (9Z of project cost); (h)
purchase of telecommnications equipment for both Andean and Eastern rail
networks (61); and (i) technical assistance and studies (112 of project
cost) for (i) MTC in planning (including an evaluation of investment
requirements in the La Paz-Cochabamba-Sants Cruz corridor), (ii) SNC in road
maintenance, (iii) ENFE in management and marketing, external audit, and
terminal design and management, and (iv) the National Institute for Export
Promotion in facilitating the use of containers and airfreight. Finally,
the project will also finance procurement services for the above (21).
6.       The balance of the program consists of construction of an all-
weather gravel road between Patacamaya and Tambo Quemado (188 km) and
supervision of construction, expected to be financed by IDB.
7.       The total cost of the entire program will be about US$98 million.
The IDA-assisted part, to be carried out over five years, is expected to
cost US$47.1 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$29.5 million (63%). IDA will contribute approximately 791 and the
Government 211 of the cost of the IDA project; within this, IDA will
finance the foreign cost of the railway goods and civil works (601), 80% of
SNC-managed road works, 901 of ESF-financed maintenance works, and 1001 of
all consultant services. The Government will on-lend US$11.3 million to
ENFE for 15 years with three years of grace, at an interest rate of LIBOR
plus 0.5; ENFE will bear the boliviano dollar exchange risk. The
Government will also pass on US$3.7 million of the IDA credit to ESF as a
grant. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events (Schedule C), the status of Bank Group
operations in Bolivia (Schedule D), and a map are also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7700-BO dated April 12, 1989, is being distributed at
the same time.
8.       Agreed Actions:  A memorandum of understanding with IDB defining
the two banks' shared interests in the export corridor program and agreeing
on procedures for coordination is to be signed in April, 1989. The
Government has agreed to earmark the necessary counterpart funds for the
project in its annual investment budget. First disbursement against works
on the La Paz-Oruro highway will be conditional on MTC providing the
counterpart funds needed for those works. It has also agreed that each year
it will submit to IDA for comment the transport sector investment program
for the following year, and show that any major road and rail investment in
export corridors it proposes to undertake outside the project is justified
economically and financially. Submission by SNC of an acceptable detailed
national road maintenance program for 1990 and an outline plan for 1991-1993



-3-
will be a eondition of effectiveness; submission and implementation of a
satisfactory program for each subsequent year until the project is completed
will be a dated covenant. SNC has also agreed to put its maintenance and
equipment management systems (now under development) into full operation
throughout the country by mid-1991.
9.       A condition of first disbursement against the railway civil works
and goods purchases is that NTC and ENFE will have put into effect a
performance agreement ('acuerdo progr-ma5), in which MTC agrees to limit its
intervention to the setting of strategic policies, objectives and
profitability goals and ENFE commits itself to achieving appropriate
performance goals against which it can be held accountable. Dated covenants
will require MTC and ENFE to renew the agreement after the first two years
and to report to IDA each year on compliance. Two other conditions of first
disbursement against the same railway items will be: hiring of consultants
for the manaaement assistanve, and a restructuring of ENFE'si freight rates
and passenzer fares, so that each service covers at least its long-run
variable cost. ENFE's awarding of a management contract for the Santa Cruz
freixht terminal in a manner satisfactory to IDA will be a condition of
first disbursement for the terminal. To ensure that ENFE and the Chilean
railway company sustain their recently improved co-ordination of operations
on the La Paz-Arica line, disbursements for the improvements on that line
will be conditional on ENFE keeping the number of loaded freight cars
awaiting traction in Arica and Charaua (Bolivian border) below an average of
100 (each) during the two previous months; ENFE will sustain such efforts
throughout the project. Finally, ENFE has agreed to achieve a working ratio
of 871 or lower in 1989-90 and 831 or lower thereafter.
10.      Project Benefits:  Direct benefits will be reductions in transport
costs and increased reliability of international freight movements. In
turn, these are expected to give an important stim.lus to exports. Savings
in direct transport costs and the avoiding of costly reconstruction of
infrastructure left unmaintained should yield an ER of at least 401. We
have no estimate of the value to users of more reliable service, which is
over and above this, but we believe it to be large.
11.      Risks: The main risk is delay, due to lack of counterpart funds
and of qualified staff in the implementing agencies. The above covenants on
the budgeting of counterpart funds and the technical assistance to be
provided address these risks. Achieving the proposed improvement in the
railway will be difficult, but made more feasible by ENFE's agreement to
recruit an expatriate management advisory team. Underpinning the success of
the whole project is continued sound macro-economic management, on which IDA
will continue to provide advice.
12.      Recommendations  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
