MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR LIVESTOCK DISEASE CONTROL PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Federative
Republic of Brazil for US$51.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years on a fixed
amortization schedule, including 3 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. It would help finance the Etrengthening of federal
and state veterinary services in Brazil.
2.        Background.  The livestock industry contributes about 30% to
agricultural GDP and about 7% to agricultural exports. Brazil has the
world's fourth largest cattle herd, the third largest pig herd and ranks
second in poultry output. Over the last decade, beef production has
remained stable, milk production has declined, pork production has
increased slightly and broiler production has increased threefold.
Brazilians now eat one-third less beef and five times as much chicken as
they did in 1970. Brazil has established an important export trade in beef
and poultry products, its net exports of these two commodities being about
US$700 million per year. If Brazil is to maintain its present exports of
livestock products and etill meet the increasing protein demands of a
rising and increasingly urbanized population, it will need substantial
growth in the output of livestock products. This will require improved
control of the diseases that affect livestock, the objective of the
proposed project.
3.        Project Objectives.  An institutional development operation aimed
at improving essential federal and state animal health services for cattle,
pigs and poultry, the proposed project would increase livestock
productivity by decreasing production losses due to disease. To this end,
it would assist the Ministry of Agriculture in transforming the existing
federal and state veterinary departments into modern, cost-effective
services. The project would enhance the capacity of federal and state
veterinary agencies in disease surveillance and control. Emphasis would be
given to improving the quality control of animal vaccines and drugs,
undertaking more effective prevention of the spread of disease outbreaks,
improving laboratory capabilities to diagnose diseases and assessing the
costs and benefits of alternative disease control strategies. These
functions complement those of a strong private sector; private
veterinarians have their own practices, and private commercial laboratories
make vaccines and drugs for animal health protection that are sold to
farmers through commercial channels.



4.        Project Description.  The proposed project would: (a) strengthen
the Ministry of Agriculture's Department of Animal Health Protection
through recruitment and training of staff, management training, employment
of consultant services and purchase of field equipment: (b) strengthen the
veterinary services of 15 states through training (both staff 'nd
management) and the purchase of equipment; (c) increase and improve the
quality of staff at nine federal laboratories belonging to the Department
or Animal Disease Laboratories through staff recruitment, training and the
use of consultant services; and (d) improve the physical facilities (plant
and equipment) at the nine federal laboratories, one state laboratory in
Rio Grande do Sul, the Panamerican Center for Foot-and-Mouth Disease
outside Rio and four quarantine stations. The project, to be carried out
over six years, provides funds for civil works, incremental staff and
related costs, consultant services, training, equipment and materials. The
total cost of the project is estimated at US$108.4 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$22.2 million (20%). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown
in Schedule B.   A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6724-BR
dated June 11, 1987, is also attached.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Government has placed a high
priority on increasing food production in cost-effective ways. This
strategy applies to the livestock sector, an important part of the food
chain in Brazil, as well as a major source of foreign exchange. The
proposed project is consistent with this approach and would assist in
improving Federal and State animal health services and their capability to
serve Brazil's private private sector, e.g., farmers and animal health
product manufacturers. A relatively small investment in animal health
services would yield significant improvements in livestock production
efficiency and help avoid disease-related export market restrictions. The
Government has endorsed the need to develop a broader strategy for growth
in the livestock sector. On-going studies are identifying key sectoral
issues affecting beef, poultry, pork and milk production. The Government
has agreed with the Bank to expand the scope and depth of these studies and
to produce a comprehensive set of proposals for the development of the
livestock sector to be discussed with the Bank by May 1988.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following: (a)
as a condition for loan effectiveness: adequate funds .ill be allocated to
the project for 1987 and 1988 in the Ministry of Agriculture's budget; (b)
as a specific condition of loan disbursement to each participating state: a
contract, satisfactory to the Bank, will be signed between the Ministry of
Agriculture and that State's Secretariat of Agriculture spelling out their
respective duties and responsibilities with regard to project
implementation; (c) as other covenants: ki) by May 31, 1988, a medium-term
strategy for livestock sector development will be elaborated under the
coordination of the Ministry of Agriculture; and in consultation with the



-3-
Bank; (ii) by September 30, 1988, the Ministry of Agriculture will revise
and put into use an adequate system of fees to importers of live animals,
for use of quarantine facilities, and to commercial chemical companies, for
product registration and product quality control; and (iii) by December 31,
1990 the Bank and the Ministry of Agriculture will jointly review project
implementation focusing on the institutional development of the federal and
state veterinary services achieved and agree on changes, if necessary.
7.        Justification.  The project would reduce production losses
suffered by the livestock industry as a result of diseases. Moreover, the
project would make the veterinary services in Brazil more cost-effective
and more responsive to the needs of the private sector. It would also:
diminish the diseases that animals can pass onto humans; have a positive
effect on exports by reducing the case for disease-related trade barriers
that are Lmposed by importing countries; and help prevent the introduction
of exotic diseases.
8.        Risks.  The main risk is that project implementation may suffer
because of inexperienced project management. This risk has been minimized
through the establishment of an institutional development unit to be
staffed and managed under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank.
Management training and consultant services would also be provided as
support. The potential financial risk iinked to the scarcity of domestic
funding has been alleviated through appropriate provision of start-up
funding and adequate assurances of counterpart funding.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
