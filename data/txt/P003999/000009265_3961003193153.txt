MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A QROUNWATER DEVELOMEN PROJE
1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of
Indonesia for US$ 54.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed Bank loan would
be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would
help finance a Groundwater Development Project.
2.  RBckgound. Agriculture remains the key sector of the Indonesian economy, contributing
about 21 percent of GDP, providing employment to s ome 55 percent of the labor force and generating
about 56 percent of non-oil exports. Food crops constitute the largest subsector, contributing 60
percent of agricultural GDP. Production of rice, the staple food in Indonesia, grew at 4.8 percent per
year during the 1979-89 period. The large expansion of irrigation infrastuucture over the last two
decades has made a major contribution .o Indonesia becoming self-sufficient in rice.
3. The Irrigation Subsector has absorbed a major part of Bank lending for Indonesian agriculture
over the past two decades with loans/credits amounting to some US$ 2.0 billion for 26 operations.
Total irrigated land is about 5.S million ha of which some 1.1 million ha are irrigated from privately
owned facilities. Within the Irrigation Subsector, public groundwamer devolopment activities started
during the late sixties. However, of some 175,000 ha with proven groundwater potential, only about
30,000 ha have been developed through Government participation and some 10,000 ha by the private
sector. Most developments have been in Java.
4.  Although proven groundwater potential is less than 4 percent of existing irrigated area in
Indonesia, increasing efforts to expand groundwater development are important, because in many
areas it is the only available irrigation source to achieve significant increases in agricultural
production. To date, IBRD has financed groundwater development as subprojects of much larger
surface irrigaton projects. Some relatively small operations have also been funded by ADB and
bilaeral donors (USAII), ODA, OECF and EEC).
5.  Subsector Issues and Lessons Leamed. Although good construction progress has been made in
recent years, the irrigation subsector program has not been accompanied by a coordinated effort to
deliver benefits from irrigated agriculture. In addition, the irrigation subsector is facing a number of
technical, institutional, financial and environmental challenges. These include requirements to:
(a) improve quality of planning, design and construction; (b) give more priority to non-construction
activities, especially the efficient O&M of completed facilities; (c) coordinate irrigation programs and
agricultural support services; (d) improve cost recovery mechanisms; and (e) increase participation by
the beneficiaries in all phases of planning, design, construction and operations. These subsectoral
challenges are interdependent and have emerged following the expansion of irrigation infrastructure
over the last decade. There have also been specific lessons learned from past groundwater projects,
including the need to: (a) systematically momtor and evaluate the groundwater resources and evaluate
the performance of ongoing development; (b) standardize technology, planning and design cntena
and procedures; and (c) plan for multipurpose use of the groundwater resources.
6.   Government Strategy. Government's 1987 Policy Statement for the Irrigation Subsector
defined policy objectives, established new policies and formulated an action program on subsector
wide O&M funding, institutional strengthening and cost recovery. This Statement has laid a basis for
subsector priorities under Repelita V (1989-1994). The strategy, as it relates specifically to
groundwater development, has been to minimize the public sector role in development by introducing
appropriate technology so that tubewell irrigation systems can be managed and maintained by the
beneficiaries. In recent years, groundwater development has received increasing importance in the
subsector strategy framework because it can help GOI achieve its objectives for poverty alleviation,
regional development and crop diversification in areas that cannot otherwise be reached. Thus, GOI
has concentrated groundwater development in areas without surface irrigation supply and where
poverty is prevalent. As part of this strategy, the project would help close the development gap on the
Outer Islands, through expansion of irrigated cropping.

7.  BnkStgx. The Bank's strategy is to support the Government as it formulates its next five
and 25 year development plans to deal with the emerging challenges in the following areas:
(a) strengthening and adapting institutions to the changing roles of the public and private sectors; (b)
improving incentives to increase efficiency and competitiveness of the eco, omy; (c) investing more in
infrastructure and human resources, but with increased efficiency; (d) reducing hard core poverty; and
(e) protecting the environment. The proposed project addresses all of these challenges in respect to
groundwater development, in particular, the turn over of completed tubewell systems to be fully
managed with O&M funded by farmer groups.
8.  Rationale for Bank InvolvenMent. The Bank has supported GOI's evolving strategies for
groundwater deveiopment since 1982 through components under larger irrigation projects. The
results have been sufficiently encouraging to justify continued Bank support for groundwater
development. The main rationale for Bank involvement in the proposed project is to help consolidate
groundwater development in Indonesia and address the main sector issues outlined in para 5 above.
With Bank encouragement and support, Government is likely to give more priority to interagency
coordination and to achieving improved quality control and design performance from completed
works. The project would support important new initiatives related to community participation and
quality control procedures leading to certification that schemes are fully operational before they are
handed over to water user associations (WUAs). It would also give special attention to encouraging
and enhancing the role of women in all project related activities. In addition, it would enable
Government to benefit from the Bank's extensive experience in groundwater development elsewhere
in Asia.
9.   Proiect Design. The proposed project would be structured as a six-year operation and
estabiish a subsector approach to multipurpose groundwater development. This would involve
standardization of: (a) the planning and design criteria; (b) implementation and 0&M procedures;
(c) institutional arrangements; and (d) community participation activities. The works would be
divided into 'go-ahead' and 'expansion' programs with some 15,300 ha of development categorized
as 'go-ahead', while some 9,350 ha are in the 'expansion' category. The 'go-ahead' part of a
program can be implemented immediately and the 'expansion' part would proceed when the
performance of existing and project tubewells has been sufficiently monitored and evaluated to satisfy
agreed performance criteria. This approach of dividing the work program into 'go-ahead' and
'expansion' categories would provide the flexibility needed to reflect the inevitable uncertainties in
groundwater development and also reduce the costs associated with groundwater exploration.
10.   Piect jLQbicLc!s. The main project obiective would be to develop groundwater irrigation in
the less developed regions of Indonesia to help alleviate poverty. The technical objectives would
include: (a) promotion of multipurpose use of groundwater resources; and (b) development of least
cost, appropriate technology that can be sustained by farmers' groups with minimal public sector
support. Institutional objectives would include: (a) support of effective beneficiary participation in
planning, design, implementation and O&M of the groundwater irrigation systems; and (b) assistance
to Government in strengthening its planning, quality control and implementation capacity for
groundwater development, including monitoring and evaluation of groundwater resources. In
addition, the proposed project would strengthen all agricultural development activities necessary to
achieve the potential benefits, and promote coordination at national and provincial levels of the
agencies concerned in provision of the services.
11.  Prject Description. The project would support groundwater development to provide
irrigation for some 25,000 ha in eleven provinces over six years (1993/94 - 1998/99). The
components would include: (a) survey, investigation, design and construction of about 240 deep
tubewells serving some 6,000 ha and about 1,900 intermediate technology tubewells serving about
18,650 ha; (b) construction of domestic water supply facilities and houseyard irrigation facilities; (c)
two year support of initial O&M of tubewell systems managed by WUAs; (d) agricultural
development acdvities, including strengthening of extension services and crop demonstrations on new
and existing groundwater facilities; (e) support for community activities including training and



strengthening of WUAs; (f) institutional supoort to standardize planning and design of least cost
technology; (g) activities related to the role of women and; and (h) strengthening implementation and
supervision procedures and project monitoring and evaluation. In addition, a pilot program would
provide irigation to some 500 ha using shallow tubewells through the agricultural component for
poor farmers unable to afford the investments themselves. The project would also strengthen
groundwater monitoring networks and train provincial staff in groundwater resources evaluation.
12.   Total costs are estimated at about Rp. 174.1 billion (US$ 84.9 million) with a foreign
exchange component of about US$ 34.4 million (or about 41 percent). The proposed bank loan of
US$ 54.0 million would finance about 70 percent of total eligible costs, excluding taxes, duties and
reserved procurement of vehicles. Retroactive financing of US$ 2.0 million equivalent is proposed
for expenditures after February 14, 1993 to facilitate advanced action for procurement of irrigation
materials, survey and design activities and employment of consultants. A breakdowni of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.1 1424-IND, dated
February 26, 1993, is being distributed separately.
13.     liementation. The project would be implemented by the Pengembangan Air Tanah (PAT)
subdirectorate of Directorate General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD), through its
subproject offices in the provinces. After commissioning, the tubewell systems would be managed
by the WUAs with the Provincial Water Resources Development Services (PRIS) providing back-up
technical support to WUAs for O&M, and the Provincial Agriculture Services (PRAS) giving
agricultural advice and support
14. Project Sustainability. Taking into account lessons learned from existing groundwater
development, the initial two years of O&M support would be the responsibility of the Govemment
under the proposed project. This would ensure a full and guaranteed irrigation service and thus
reduce the risis to poor farmers associated with the transition from rainfed to irrigated agriculture.
However, during this period, the farmers would be expected to pay their WUA for water, with the
accrued income placed in a reserve fund against long-term repairs. WUAs would be encouraged to
use these funds as an agricultural credit source for group beneficiaries. With initial O&M support, by
the third year of operation, the farmers would then be able to generate enough incremental income to
operate and maintain the new project tubewell systems at their own expense and thereby ensure
sustainability of the systems. In addition, the PRIS and PRAS would be strengthened to provide
long-term advisory and technical support services to the WUAs, particularly related to efficient
running of the tubewell systems and for major repairs to the diesel engines and pumps. This backup
service would be primarily to reduce the risk of damage to standing crops through a service to quickly
replace equipment with the full cost paid by the WUJAs. It will also provide a permanent institutional
arrangement to enable GOI to monitor the project developmental impact.
15.  Agreed Acd=ns. During negotiadons, assurances were obtained from Government that it
would: (a) select, implement, commission and monitor project schemes in accordance with agreed
procedures and criteria; (b) undertake project coordinadon at national and provincial levels, assisted
by consultants to be retained under agreed terms of reference by September 30, 1993; (c) submit for
Bank review, for each province, a coordinated work program and cost estimates, not later than
September 30 of each year, and coordinated budget proposals for agreed provincial work programs
by December 31 of each year, (d) monitor and evaluate project implementation and performance and
groundwater resources in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (e) undertake environmental assessment
in the project areas to ensure that water quality and social equity considerations are taken into account
in the siting of tubewell facilites; and (f) procure project vehicles from its own funds under an agreed
schedule. In addition, a condition of disbursement would be that Government would make annual
budgetary allocations to implement the agreed annual work programs in each of the project provinces.



-4-
16. Rnvironvaental Impact. Groundwater development in the designated areas would have limited
impact with respect to natural resources. Aspects which would be given special attention during
planning and design include: (a) water quality, particularly in coastal areas with risks of saline
intrusion; and (b) competing uses of groundwater and the potential of negative impact on existing
domestic water supply wells. The project will support groundwater resources monitoring to provide
the data base for environmental impact assessment.
17. Progm OQjecis C=gfzj. The project would significantly contribute to the GOrs poverty
reduction objective as it is specifically targeted to reach many of the poorest provinces in Indonesia.
In addition, the project would achieve important social benefits since it gives special attention to full
community participadon in the development process including the role of women. The project makes
specific provision to enhance and encourage the role of women in project activities.
18. Benefts. The ERR of the overall project is estimated at about 14.5 percent and about 50,000
families are expected to directly benefit from new areas brought under irrigation. The project would
also promote secondary income generating activities (houseyard irrigation) and reduce use of labor in
routine tasks (domestic water supply). In addition, the project provides the possibility to decentalize
discrete development programs that can be planned and implemented to reflect provincial and regional
priorities. Improved coordination of groundwater development activides and the wiiea provincial
coverage of the project should help address important subsector issues relating to coordinated
development, project preparation, standardization of planning and design, quality control, beneficiary
participation, effective O&M, and cost recovery. The muldpurposte use of groundwater resources
would produce community benefits and more fully utilize investments in the wells.
19.   £iaI. The main risk concerns the project's economic viability, namely, the failure to contain
costs and achieve potential benefits in a timely manner. Technical risks relate to improving quality
control in planning, design and implementation. Another risk is that farmers will not fully utilHze the
facilities and sustain the infrastructure through collection of the necessary water charges. Other
uncertainties relate to management, administrative and staffing constraints of the implementing
agencies; the effect of reduced support of technical assistance (compared to previous groundwater
development); some unpredictability of local funding, particularly through the initial O&M period; and
delays in procurement of equipment and materials. Specific actions proposed to address these risks
are: (a) the six-year project period; (b) a phased work program subject to annual reviews and (c) the
involvement of agriculturl support services. Provisions to encourage full community participation
and encourage secondary benefits should reduce farme related risks and promote self-help. Risks
will also be reduced by paying specific atenton to the many implementation lessons learned from
previous groundwater development including (a) specific screening and planning procedures for
tubewell site selection; (b) standaization of design critera and implementation procedures, (c) more
attendon by implementing agencies on quality control; and (d) improved institutional coordination
through focused technical assistance.
20.   Recmmedatio. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
