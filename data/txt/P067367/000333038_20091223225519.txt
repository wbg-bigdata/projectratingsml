Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the project is to maintain and improve environmentally sustainable
management of state and private forests so as to increase the contribution to the national
and rural economies derived from Romanian forest resources.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The objectives of the project are: (i) to improve the management of state-owned forests
through capacity building and technical innovation for environmentally sustainable and
cost-effective forest management, and (ii) to support the establishment of pilot systems
for forest management among underserved private forest owners.

 1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

 1.1 Context at Appraisal
 The Forest Development Project (FDP) was designed to address two broad development
 goals in the joint World Bank/International Finance Corporation (IFC) Country
 Assistance Strategy (CAS), namely institution building and governance, and private
 sector development. Major sector priorities at the time included: a) fostering an improved
 climate for increased sector efficiency and investment, especially due to the low density
 of forest road networks and resulting high wood extraction costs; b) strengthening weak
 supervisory, regulatory, and monitoring capacity for public forests and newly restituted
 private forests, and the potential impact this could have on commercial and non-market
 forest values; c) improving the low capability of the National Forest Administration
 (NFA) to meet the emerging functional and financial challenges from the transfer of large
 areas of state forests back to their original owners; and d) developing a more efficient
 timber pricing policy.

 1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
 From the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the original project development objective
 was to, maintain and improve environmentally sustainable management of state and
 private forests so as to increase the contribution to the national and rural economies
 derived from Romanian forest resources.

 Consistent with prevailing practice in ECA at the time, main performance indicators in
 the PAD (Annex 1 and summarized on page 2 of the PAD) were confirmed in a side
 letter (January 31, 2003) during negotiations:

  i.   The capacity of the Forest Inspectorates to provide better regulatory and governance
       oversight for public and private sector forest management is increased through
       training and through the provision of information technology;
ii.    A comprehensive Forest Management Information and Monitoring System
       (FMIMS) is developed and is being implemented;
iii.   A public awareness strategy and campaign is developed and implemented which
       targets key stakeholders, including the general public, Non-governmental
       organizations (NGOs), NFA and Government decision makers, to build public
       support for sustainable forest management;
iv.    The capacity of the Department of Forestry (DOF) is assessed and strengthened to
       provide extension and advisory services to meet the needs of private forest owners,
       as well as to supervise, regulate and monitor sustainable forest management
       activities in private and state owned forest lands;
 v.    NFA has developed and is implementing a strategic plan to strengthen and finance
       its role in the sustainable management of state-owned forests, and the operational
       and economic efficiency of NFA activities is increased;
vi.    An outreach office for private forest owners associations is operational within
       Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forests (MAFF), with adequate staff and budget,
       and is providing a range of services to associations;



                                             1
vii.    The Forest Sector Business Information Center (ForSBIC) is established and is
        providing assistance for private investment in the forestry sector;
viii.   Best Practice Guidelines (BPG) for the construction, rehabilitation, and
        maintenance of Forest Roads are prepared;
 ix.    Road sub-projects are being designed in a manner consistent with Best Practice
        Guidelines, and are being screened and assessed for their likely environmental
        impact. Impacts are being mitigated;
  x.    The forest road network is being rehabilitated and expanded on a pilot basis to
        reduce the environmental impact and improve the economic viability of wood
        harvesting in state owned production forests. The Environmental Management Plan
        is under implementation; and
 xi.    Training for all project activities is implemented in accordance with yearly training
        program agreed between the Government and the Bank.

  1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators
  The project was formally restructured in March 2008, following an official request from
  the Government of Romania (dated October 18, 2007). The revised PDO is to, improve
  the management of state-owned forests through capacity building and technical
  innovation for environmentally sustainable and cost effective forest management; and
  support the establishment of pilot systems for forest management among underserved
  private forest owners.

  The restructuring reflected several changing factors and conditions. First at appraisal, it
  was envisaged that no more than one-third (around 2 million hectares) of Romania's 6.4
  million ha of state forests would be formally restituted, following passage of Law 1/2000.
  A new law in 2005 (Law 247/2005), greatly increased the proposed area to be restituted
  by 2010, to a total of around 4.5 million ha, or 70 percent of the forest estate. By the end
  of the project and based on actual progress with restitution, it was forecast that by 2010,
  approximately 55 percent of state forest lands would have been transferred to private
  hands (Figure 1). It was also envisaged at appraisal that there would be significant scope
  for working with private Figure 1. Forecast forest restitution and ownership, Romania.
  forest owners, but in
  practice, the largest land
  owners started grouping
  themselves into Private
  Forest Districts and hired
  former NFA staff to manage
  them with minimal inputs
  from government. There was
  a growing need to focus
  more attention on the 1
  million ha of restituted forest
  held by 800,000 individual owners, with an average holding size of only 1.25 ha. Second,
  substantial private sector investment in the forest products industry had also occurred in
  conjunction with restitution and expansion into European markets. Forest product market
  information had become more readily available through various private networks than
  was the case during project preparation. This meant that the envisaged support for a

                                               2
publicly-funded forest industry information mechanism (ForSBIC) was no longer
required. Third, in response to rapidly changing international markets for forest products
and with support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF)-financed Biodiversity
Conservation Management Project, the NFA was certifying over 1 million ha of state
forests under the global Forest Stewardship Council standard. Many of the larger Private
Forest Districts were taking the same approach. These developments reduced the
rationale for developing an independent national forest quality standard under the project.
Fourth, rapidly evolving and lower cost technologies, and the expanding demand for
information about the status of forest management, opened up new opportunities for
technical innovation, which had not been considered at appraisal. Finally, in light of the
significant changes which had taken place in the policy and institutional framework, it
was acknowledged that it was unlikely that the project's original Development Objectives
could be achieved, given the activities and financing available through the project.
Government agreed with the Bank's recommendation to scale the PDOs better to reflect
the project's likely outcomes. Although the PDOs were modified to take account of these
macro-level changes, the performance indicators referred were mostly unchanged, except
for those associated with the ForSBIC activity, which was dropped as a result of the
restructuring. The ICR team fully concurs with the decision to restructure the project by
modifying the PDOs, and to bring them into line with what the project was likely to
achieve.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The project was designed to deliver a range of environmental, economic, social and
institutional benefits. The PAD identified benefit types but did not estimate specific
numbers of potential beneficiaries. Environmental benefits were to be generated by
providing assistance and guidance to new private forest owners, supervision and
monitoring of approved forest management plans, and developing BPGs for rehabilitating
forest access roads. Economic benefits would result by reducing uncontrolled harvesting
and maintaining the sustainable productive capacity of timber and other forest products,
particularly for small, private forest owners following forest land restitution. Social
benefits were to be created through the protection of newly restituted forests and
subsequent decrease in the likelihood of flooding and erosion and resultant damage to
agricultural lands and other rural infrastructure such as roads and bridges. The improved
forest road network on state forest lands would improve access to a wide range of forest
products for commercial and personal use. Institutional benefits would arise by
improved forest protection through, strengthened regulatory, supervisory and advisory
capacity of the Forest Inspectorate; and the development and execution of a long-term
organizational strategy for the NFA. These benefits and beneficiaries did not change with
the revised PDO.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
From the PAD, the project had five components, with an estimated cost of US$32 million,
including $25 million in IBRD financing:

Component 1: Establish Systems to Ensure Sustainable Management of Private Forest
Lands (US$10.05 million). This component would, a) strengthen the DOF, with emphasis
on the Forest Inspectorates to supervise, regulate and monitor sustainable forest
management activities in private and state forest lands, as well as provide extension and
                                            3
advisory services to meet the needs of new private forest owners; b) support the
development of Private Forest Owners Associations at national and local levels; and (c)
establish a national FMIMS to support the Forest Inspectorates supervision and control
functions for sustainable management and development of the forest sector.

Component 2: Mitigate the Consequences of Restitution on Management of State Forest
Land (US$19.24 million). This component was to support, a) reform and strategic
development of the NFA through preparation and implementation of a strategic plan to
develop and finance its role in managing State forests; and (b) rehabilitation and
extension of the forest road network on a pilot basis, to improve the economic viability of
wood harvesting in State-managed production forests, and test approaches toward
reducing the negative environmental impacts of forest road construction.

Component 3: Support Increased Productivity and Competitiveness of Forest Industries
(US$0.72 million). This component would finance the establishment of the ForSBIC - an
independent business development and advisory service, which would establish linkages
and coordination within the forest industry chain, and provide assistance to wood and
related forest industries, through review and dissemination of information.

Component 4: Building Public Support for Sustainable Forest Management (US$0.69
million). This component would prepare and implement a public awareness strategy and
campaign targeting key stakeholders including the general public, through preparing and
implementing a public awareness strategy and campaign targeting key stakeholders.
These would include the general public, with particular emphasis on communities living
in forested areas; private forest owners; Forest Inspectorate staff; NFA; government
decision makers; and other influential groups including the churches and NGOs.

Component 5: Project Management and Monitoring (US$1.19 million). This component
would finance the operation of the Project Management Unit (PMU) and its role of
overseeing and supporting implementation of all program activities in accordance with
agreed verifiable indicators.

1.6 Revised Components
The formally restructured project,approved by both government and the World Bank
Board, a) dropped component 3 - support for the establishment of the ForSBIC; b) added
support to design a pilot Forest Geographic Information System (GIS) as part of the
FMIMS; c) scaled back the forest roads rehabilitation activity from 57 roads (425 km) to
22 roads (with a target of 220 km), largely due to higher than expected costs (from
delayed start-up and inflation, and appreciation of the local currency against the US$);
and d) shifted support for private forest owners to focus on the owners of the smallest
forest holdings, who generally lacked capacity or the means for achieving improved
management. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) funds
originally allocated to component 3 (US$380,000) were added to component 1 (Table 1)1.

The project's closing date and loan amount remained unchanged. Performance indicators
related to component 3 were dropped. The original main performance indicators in the
PAD (shown on pages 1 and 2 of this ICR report) were retained.

1.7 Other significant changes
Not all the initial roads identified during preparation were ultimately selected during
implementation for two reasons. First, access roads were originally planned for NFA
forests, but following the expanded restitution process in 2005, many of the forests
around these roads were restituted and no longer met the selection criteria. Second, a
small number of roads identified for rehabilitation were located in protected forest areas.
Due to the concerns raised by one NGO that upgrading these roads might cause illegal
logging in protected areas, the Bank and government of Romania decided to drop these
roads from the project. From January 2009, the Ministry of Finance changed its policy
governing externally aided projects, revising disbursement systems to Treasury pre-
finance of the loan and closing all Special Accounts. There has been no major impact
from this change, other than slight delays in payments.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Assessment of project design suggests that at the time of preparation and appraisal, the
rationale for Bank involvement was strong and appropriate, building on a solid
foundation of experiences from Bank lending and non-lending programs globally, as well
as government of Romania forest sector policy reforms. In particular:
· The objectives and components, proposed interventions, processes and institutional
    arrangements in the design were generally sound. The project alternatives identified
    and analyzed in the PAD were relevant;
· At appraisal, overall components were all highly relevant and complementary to the
    overarching government policy goal of forest restitution of public forests to former
    private owners. The appraisal mission was responsive to concerns raised in the
    environmental assessment; and
· The extensive involvement of civil society during project preparation, particularly
    with the environmental assessment and subsequently in preparing Best Practice
    Guidelines (BPGs) for Forest Roads Construction and Rehabilitation, was thorough
    and well-documented. One NGO (based in Hungary) raised a number of issues about
    the original environmental assessment and had broader concerns about the project in

                                                5
   general, prior to the scheduled Board presentation. In response, the Bank and the
   renamed Ministry of Agriculture, Forests and Rural Development (MAFRD)
   undertook a thorough review and revision of the Environmental Assessment (EA),
   including additional and comprehensive stakeholder consultations. They also
   meticulously responded to each of the broader concerns raised by the NGO; this did
   not substantively change the scope or nature of the project. This process took several
   months and contributed to the delay in Board approval and start-up.

The risks and mitigation measures (PAD, p36) were well identified and appropriate.
Four of the five risks carried "substantial" ratings and the ICR mission has found that
these four potential risks all came into play to some degree during project
implementation. The mitigation measures identified in the PAD for the substantial risks
were therefore relevant and of critical importance. The overall risk rating of "substantial"
was appropriate. The vastly expanded program of land restitution, a major factor in
project restructuring, could not have been foreseen at appraisal, and was a political
decision far beyond the scope or influence of the project.

2.2 Implementation
As of October 5, 2009 (three months after closure) US$20.16 million from the US$25
million IBRD loan had been disbursed. US$3.65 million had been cancelled, and
US$1.19 million was undisbursed and also likely to be cancelled, pending reconciliation
of final claims. Total disbursements represent 81 percent of the original loan. The full
loan was not disbursed because: a) the final roads rehabilitation tender was cancelled; b)
government took a decision not to employ certain IT specialists; and c) the Ministry
absorbed vehicle operating costs rather than charging them against the loan as originally
planned. With respect to the cancellation of the final roads tender, only one bid was
received at a significantly higher cost than prevailing rates and it was rejected. This was a
prudent procurement decision. There was insufficient time remaining before the project
closed to retender this package, coupled with a decision (ultimately taken by the Ministry
of Public Finance) not to extend the project's closing date.

The project has essentially completed its targeted activities as per the revised
components. The key reasons for this achievement were that PMU and Bank task teams
were highly responsive to issues raised during supervision and took corrective action, in
light of an evolving operating environment.

The project did suffer early implementation delays. The main causal factors included:
· The project had to be ratified by the Romanian parliament, a step that took 9 months
   largely because this was the first Bank project which had to meet this requirement.
   The process for doing so was poorly understood by key parties, and it required
   substantial time and effort to complete this;
· Completion of the BPGs for Forest Roads Construction and Rehabilitation, which
   required extensive internal and external consultations and approvals, that took several
   months. These were structural delays, and an outcome of the Bank's insistence that
   safeguards concerns had to be addressed before tendering any of the roads
   rehabilitation work. These delays were not a reflection of inadequate capacity to


                                             6
    implement the roads component, and did not represent poor implementation
    performance;
·   Unforeseen and extensive institutional changes after project effectiveness, including
    subordination of the Forest Inspectorates to the Ministry of Control, followed by
    reversion to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development;
·   Various Ministerial restructurings and management disruptions during and after
    election cycles, resulting in approval delays; and
·   Lengthy and bureaucratic planning, approval, and procurement with the first roads
    rehabilitation package and seasonality problems. Contracts were only signed in
    September 2006, 18 months following submission of road designs to the NFA
    Commission for initial review. Most construction had to wait until spring since many
    areas were not accessible in the winter.

These delays were substantive enough for implementation performance to be downgraded
to Moderately Unsatisfactory in June, 2007.2 However, performance as measured by field
activities and disbursements subsequently improved and by February 2008 (8 months
later) and following completion of an agreed action plan, implementation performance
was upgraded to Satisfactory. Over the course of a six-year project, this was the only
period where implementation performance was less than satisfactory, a very positive
point.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design: The PAD identified 11 key performance indicators. These are largely tied
to outputs, for example the number of Forest Inspectorate branch offices established,
participants taking training courses, FMIMS application modules development and
installed, etc, with less emphasis on impacts or outcomes.3 This was consistent with the
prevailing practice at the time the project was Appraised. Various commitments to M&E
activities are made in the PAD, but there was no budget allocated to deal with these. For
example, the main body of the PAD states that a national institutional analysis to show
the costs and benefits of changes in forest ownership and management would "...be
complemented by more detailed social and institutional analyses of the most directly
affected populations with a focus on inhabitants of forested areas". These assessments
were to be based on detailed surveys (individual, household, and community) at the
beginning, mid-term and end of the project. A social assessment was completed before
appraisal, and a more detailed assessment was carried out the following year (and
financed by the Bank's budget), but no further surveys were carried out. The project team
argued that these were `moving targets,' and that these types of surveys would not have
been especially useful because of the rapid change in the rural landscape which was being
introduced by 2005 revisions to the law on restitution.


2
        It should be noted that the downgraded IP rating is unrelated to the decision to
seek a first order restructuring of the project.
3
      There are, for example, there are no indicators to capture whether or not forest
management has actually improved.


                                             7
M&E implementation: During project implementation, a number of monitoring tools
were prepared, including social and environmental monitoring systems for access roads,
monitoring tools for private forest owner associations, and an assessment tool for the
Forest Inspectorates. Baseline and outcome surveys were commissioned for a series of
activities in conjunction with contract implementation. For example, the public
awareness contract required completion of a baseline and final survey to establish the
impact of public awareness measures, and the contracted TA inputs for work with private
forest owners associations required completion of an assessment and `lessons learned'
activity. These were a very relevant focus for improving project performance, but were
not consistent with traditional perspectives on implementation of M&E, which some
observers have argued was ad hoc and uncoordinated. The proposed social assessment
monitoring was not completed as planned in the PAD, due to cost considerations as well
as growing uncertainty if it was really needed, given there was no explicit social
components or outcomes in the project. With respect to indicators which might have
captured changes in the quality of forest management, it would have been highly
problematic to prepare and monitor these. It might have been possible to capture this
through systematically reviewing forest certification audits, but these are proprietary and
not generally available for review or comment. In addition, certification was only
introduced midway through the project, and audits would not have provided sufficient or
timely baseline information from which conclusions about project impacts could have
been drawn.

M&E utilization: Using information generated by the PMU, internal Bank
Implementation Status and Results (ISR) reports did track several key performance
indicators against a baseline from October 2003. This information was used by
management to monitor progress and guide project direction.

Methodological "soundness", data quality and M&E sustainability: Post-project M&E of
longer-term impacts and outcomes is uncertain because the PMU closed when the project
ended on June 30, 2009. While the NFA and Ministry were responsible for project
implementation and M&E, it was unclear to what extent the M&E function would be
taken up after the PMU closed. On a positive point, the government now has the FMIMS,
which could provide a good tool for monitoring forest management in the country.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Based on the PAD, only three safeguards applied to the project:
· Environmental assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.10, GP 4.01);
· Natural habitats (OP 4.04, BP 4.04, GP 4.04); and
· Forestry (OP 4.36, GP 4.36).

In reviewing the PAD, Aide Memoires, and internal ISRs, and also during field visits,
there were no major deviations or waivers of environmental, natural habitat or forestry
safeguards during implementation. Performance has generally been rated as Satisfactory
throughout against the above safeguards. The access road activity represented the only
major physical works in the project and works were implemented in compliance with
Romanian and Bank environmental safeguards. The project has been subject to regular
financial management and procurement oversight. Generally, performance in these areas

                                            8
has been rated Satisfactory, with periodic, short-term downgrading to Moderately
Unsatisfactory for procurement between July, 2005 and October, 2006. The project has
been in compliance with the financial covenants of the legal agreements. The two most
recent ISR reports rated financial management and procurement performance as
Satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The project financed investment costs for the Forest Inspectorates, while the Ministry
covered operating costs. The government of Romania has committed to finance the
Inspectorates' operation post-project, although under the current tight fiscal climate in the
government, capital and operational budgets might be constrained. The MAFRD has
indicated that it intends to hire 11 new technical staff after the project closed to support
further implementation of the FMIMS, plus integration with the pilot GIS component.
For roads rehabilitated under the project, the NFA carries out routine maintenance,
financed from 10 percent of its forest revenues. The project has supported the
development of excellent tools and training for Best Practice Guidelines for access road
construction and rehabilitation. The guidelines have been adopted by NFA and are
mandatory for tender documents. An expanded program of budget-financed road
rehabilitation is unlikely in the near term, under current fiscal and market conditions, and
restricted cash flow of NFA while timber markets are soft.

A number of potential follow-on activities could contribute to sustaining project benefits
and more broadly, forest sector development in Romania. These include:

·   Further technical support for the national-level FMIMS and scaling up GIS
    operations, to support forest planning, monitoring and evaluation, and policy analysis.
    There is also considerable merit to support a forest land registry system, tied to GIS
    mapping;
·   Financing a participatory approach to review and revise the national forest policy and
    strategy, legislative framework, and forest regulations. It is extremely important to
    establish a regulatory framework that will unlock economic opportunities for private
    owners and NFA. There is general agreement that the legal and regulatory framework
    for forestry is vastly outdated, and is not consistent with Romania's relatively
    progressive forest policy framework, and needs to be substantively revised for it to
    support the development of a viable sector;
·   Provide technical assistance and modest financing for longer-term institutional
    support for the three key players in the Romanian forest sector; the NFA, the Forest
    Inspectorates, and private forest owners. The NFA would benefit from support for
    implementation of their strategic plan, which could lead to major organizational
    reform and improved efficiencies. With the Forest Inspectorates, there is scope for
    further support for additional training and other measures to help them mature into a
    stronger institution. The emerging forest owner associations would benefit from
    further technical assistance and access to credit, particularly to help them evolve into
    independent private forest districts; and
·   Additional investment in forest roads, building on the lessons learned through this
    pilot program (which rehabilitated just over 200 km of roads). Probably around 15
    percent of the total forest road infrastructure (of 40,000 km) is in need of

                                             9
      rehabilitation, and there remains a pressing need for further increasing the density of
      forest roads in state forests. In virtually all forest sectors in Europe, investments in
      new forest roads are considered to be a public good (because of the range of services
      they provide), and are financed by the budget, while Operations and Maintenance are
      funded by state forest institutions (or by the private sector) from revenues. Additional
      investment in protected areas management is also needed, which generally cover
      forest areas and buffer zones around national parks.

Accession to the EU poses opportunities for further action in the forest sector, under the
Common Agricultural Policy (Pillar 2 Agri-environment measures). These measures are
targeted at private forest owners, particularly those who are able to adopt nature
conservation measures consistent with the Birds and Habitats Directives. They do not
address the need for investment in public assets such as forest roads or in the FMIMS, or
in the management of state-owned forests.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of Objectives: The revised project development objective of, improving the
management of state-owned forests and technical innovation for environmentally
sustainable and cost-effective forest management; and supporting pilot systems for forest
management among underserved private sector forest owners, continues to be highly
relevant. Clearly, improving the management capacities and technical innovation of both
the state and new, private forest owners, and increasing the resulting flow of economic
benefits from the forest will remain an important national development objective.

Relevance of Design: The core design elements of institutional development and capacity
building (both for state agencies and private owners), rehabilitation of degraded forest
access roads, and building public support for forestry are still valid. The project has laid a
strong foundation for continued scaling up of private forest associations and higher level
federations; wider application of the BPG for forest access road construction and
rehabilitation; longer-term reform of the NFA; and application of forest management
information systems.

Relevance of Implementation: The operation remained important and was responsive to
important national forest sector policy and development initiatives. The decision to drop
the ForSBIC component was sound and reflected a growing awareness that market
information was becoming much more available through a wide range of sources.
                                                                  4
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

PDO 1. Improve the management of state-owned forests through capacity building and
technical innovation for environmentally sustainable and cost-effective forest
management (Rating - Satisfactory). The project's activities have largely been
implemented effectively in meeting these objectives, as follows:

    Refer to Annex 2 for more details on outcomes against performance indicators


                                                     10
·   Capacity building: The capacity building measures to strengthen the Forest
    Inspectorates and headquarters staff of MAFRD have largely been completed. An
    evaluation of the training based on trainee feedback was quite positive and showed
    the project had made significant impacts on the ability of MAFRD staff to perform
    effectively.
·   Institutional development: The NFA was assisted to develop a comprehensive
    strategic plan, which sets out six thematic areas for organizational reform. One
    strategic option, directly related to an objective in the PAD, was to support an
    analysis and recommendations for a more transparent timber pricing system in NFA
    forests. This was completed and resulted in a shift from using average floor prices, to
    prices that better reflect local timber quality and site conditions. The project also
    trained 35 young, dynamic NFA staff as "champions" or "change agents" who will
    help drive institutional change in the organization. Assistance was also provided to
    pilot the establishment of new ALFOs of small-scale private forest owners and create
    development plans. These associations are slowly scaling up in some areas. All six
    thematic areas identified in the Strategy are in some stage of implementation, and the
    Strategy provided an important framework for NFA development.
·   Technical innovation: The preparation, field testing, and adoption of the BPG is a
    significant project accomplishment, which emphasized the importance of social,
    environmental, and economic impacts of forest roads rehabilitation and construction.
    New approaches for culverts and gabions were developed and implemented with
    positive environmental effects. With respect to the FMIMS, the full system has been
    installed and tested in headquarter and field office. Regional Forest Inspectorates and
    Ministry staff have been trained in its use. Two additional modules, which were not
    envisaged at appraisal, were developed and are in various stages of piloting and
    implementation. One of these modules put in place a chain of custody timber tracking
    system. It has been under implementation since last November and there are now
    12,500 registered users. The second was the GIS module, which was designed to
    provide the basis for incorporating remote sensing data and inventory information
    into the FMIMS. It has been developed and tested in two pilot forest districts, and is
    now being scaled up.
·   Environmental and sustainable forest management: Separate social and
    environmental reviews for access road rehabilitation were carried out, both as part of
    supervision but also in conjunction with the PMU's contract management practices.
    Twenty-two roads, covering an estimated 210 km of roads were rehabilitated,
    resulting in improved access for 41 forest communities and an estimated 14,000
    beneficiaries. The BPGs for road rehabilitation were completed and are in the process
    of being adopted at the national level.
·   Cost-effective forest management: The assessment of economic returns to
    investments in roads rehabilitation suggests very high rates of return (see Section 3.3
    below). Rehabilitation costs, while higher than estimated at appraisal, were 20 percent
    less than comparable road costs elsewhere in the country. The project introduced
    important modalities for improving contract management.

PDO 2. Support the establishment of pilot systems for forest management among
underserved private forest owners (Rating - Satisfactory). The project has addressed this

                                            11
objective to the satisfaction of the ICR mission. Field and office equipment for the
National Association of Private Forest Owners (NAPFO) was procured and is being used
to improve its capacity to engage with local forest owners associations. The project
helped establish 22 private forest associations. Nine of these associations were initially
created, registered with the government, and training tools developed for them. An
evaluation of these pilots and the development of a series of `lessons learned' provided
important guidance for the creation of 13 more associations. Thirty more associations are
under development based on the project methodology and in different stages of obtaining
authorizations and licenses. Some of the associations are achieving real success. For
example, Marsani Association is afforesting another 800 ha of agricultural land in the
biggest afforestation project in the country, using funds raised from other sources.
Several members of the association have graduated from the school for forest rangers and
are now guardians of the association's forest. Viisoara Ruget Association is now
considered as being the strongest association in Vrancea County. Twenty Territorial
Inspectorates, who will be supporting private forest owners, have been strengthened
through successful provision of vehicles, office and field equipment, and intensive
training of more than 400 staff. An effectiveness monitoring tool for Inspectorate field
staff use was developed and successfully tested - the first time, to the team's knowledge,
that a systematic performance monitoring tool has been developed to improve forest
governance anywhere. These activities were supported by a major public awareness
campaign that included development of a web site, production and dissemination of
promotional materials of success stories of private forest management, delivering
seminars in the nine Territorial Inspectorates, and producing television spots and a
documentary program. A final survey was undertaken to evaluate the results of the
program and draw valuable lessons for future public awareness activities.

3.3 Efficiency
During the mission, the economic viability of the access roads program was reappraised.
The roads activity comprised the majority of expenditures during implementation and
was felt to have the greatest overall impact on economic returns. In the PAD, the
estimated Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was 24 percent with a Net Present Value
(NPV) of just under US$14 million. An estimate of actual economic returns shows that
these investments achieved satisfactory economic returns5. The estimated ERR comes to
107 percent for the whole roads program and the Net Present Value is Romania New Lei
(RON) 53 million or US$21 million. The high returns reflect the fact that repairing roads
gives access to more forest resources (at lower harvesting and transport costs) for a
relatively small investment. For example, repairing a single bridge and modest
resurfacing can provide access to a resource served by a 40 km road while opening up
thousands of hectares of forests to harvesting (in a manner consistent with prevailing
forest management plans).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

    A more detailed economic analysis is found in Annex 3.

Overall ratings: 1) Relevance - Satisfactory; 2) PDO ­ Satisfactory; 3) Efficiency -
Satisfactory. This gives an overall Satisfactory rating. Table 2 indicates the overall
revised PDO rating and weights used for each component of the revised PDO.

The project largely met its targets around the revised PDO (more details are shown in
Annexes 2 and 5). It has laid a relatively strong foundation for further sector
development, particularly around forest management information systems, application of
BPGs for access road construction and rehabilitation, and expansion of private forest
owners associations. The ICR team rates the project as Satisfactory both during the
period up to restructuring in March 2008, and then to closure in June 2009. While the
revised and more focused PDO better aligned expectations with what could actually be
achieved, the ICR team is of the view that the project activities (marginally revised
during restructuring) all have added to the longer-term outcomes and broader impacts
associated with the original PDO such as increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
contributions and economic value of exports.

3.5 Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The project has seen a number of unintended impacts. First, the government pushed to
adopt the chain-of-custody component of the FMIMS, which has the potential to improve
the tracking of timber harvesting and sales. Although the system still has some operating
issues and may have been rolled out prematurely, it has already helped resolve several
cases of illegal logging. Second, a number of small private forest owners associations are
federating into larger units. This is a positive and unanticipated development, which will

economies of scale with respect to management, production and marketing.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A stakeholder workshop (see Annex 6) was held during the ICR mission and the results
incorporated into the borrower's report. Key observations raised during the workshop
included that:

·   with the changes in the leadership of central authorities, implementing projects
    through a Management Team is the best way to keep the continuity and the focus of
    the project objectives; staff continuity is an important condition for a PMU to be as
    effective as possible;
·   To avoid delays in the early implementation of the project, experienced and
    competent procurement and operational management specialists should be found
    early and trained immediately after the project becomes effective;
·   The high-level Project Oversight Committee (POC) was an important official
    institutional link between the PMU and the Ministry; and
·   The monitoring and evaluating system must be established as early as possible.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The Risk to Development Outcome is considered Substantial, stemming mainly from
government budgetary constraints to sustain a number of project achievements. This has
implications on sustained support for the FMIMS and GIS tools being scaled up, if
MAFRD cannot follow through on its commitment to hire 11 technical staff. Another
risk from fiscal constraints could be the inability of NFA to maintain roads rehabilitated
under the project, despite the built-in system to ear-mark 10 percent of harvesting
revenues to road maintenance. With current low timber prices, NFA timber harvests and
revenues are very limited, which is causing severe cash-flow problems. Another risk is
the possible increase in unrecorded logging from forests held by the smaller forest
owners (with 1 or 2 hectares) who are unable to legally harvest their timber without
enduring a major bureaucratic process through NFA or Private Forest Districts. In the
absence of simplified management guidelines and regulations for these owners, some
may decide to liquidate their forests.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory. The design was appropriate at the time of appraisal, and was
derived from a highly participatory National Forest Policy and Strategy Process.
Safeguards issues were effectively addressed before approval, and extensive efforts were
made to engage key stakeholders in designing project interventions.

(b) Quality of Supervision


                                           14
Rating: Satisfactory. Supervision was supportive to PMU decisions and providing timely
technical advice, for example on road rehabilitation and developing private forest owner
associations. The Bank was particularly responsive to the need for flexibility to address
changes, such as the formal restructuring, to ensure project resources and timing would
achieve successful results in a changing operating environment. There has been excellent
communication between the task manager and members of the PMU and the Ministry,
and Bank support for procurement and project management. The PMU has indicated that,
that it would have liked more support from the Bank's country office to help intermediate
with senior government officials about the project and about evolving government
priorities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Overall Rating: Satisfactory. The high quality of supervision and flexibility in adapting to
a rapidly changing operating environment during implementation is a major factor in this
rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The government of Romania has demonstrated good
support for the project in approving contracts (albeit sometimes with delays) and in
providing audited statements in a timely manner. Project activities were explicitly linked
with the national forest policy. At the same time however, because of changes in national
government, MAFRD suffered from numerous shifts in leadership (7 Ministers and 7
Secretaries of State for Forestry), resulting in poor continuity and requiring extensive
briefings for new senior officials. The prescriptive legislative system and relatively
sudden changes in key legal and policy frameworks, such as the expanded program of
forest restitution in 2005, resulted in uncertain operating conditions for the project team.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory. Despite the constraints of constant changes in the government and
Ministry, the PMU performed effectively and is a good example of where a separate, but
small and service-oriented implementing unit was appropriate. The POC, comprising of
senior government and non-government officials met as required to address major project
needs, for example getting government agreement to drop the ForSBIC component
during restructuring.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Overall Rating: Satisfactory. The rating is based on good performance by the parent
Ministry with financial management and audit, and by the excellent and consistent
performance of the PMU.

6. Lessons Learned
  a) FMIMS timing and ownership: Agreeing on the structure and development of
     new information management systems for the forest sector, programming the
     software, and instituting the proper use of those new systems can take considerable
     time. At appraisal, very few cost-effective systems existed. For future FMIMS
     developments, off-the-shelf systems are now available at reasonable costs.

                                            15
 b) Managing NGO relations in forestry projects: In recent years, the Bank has been
    hesitant to invest in forestry, and in particular, road activities because of heightened
    NGO attention. Because of the generally good outcomes of this project, especially
    with access roads, and the strong environmental and social linkages, this positive
    experience could offer an important lesson for the Bank both in terms of how to
    engage NGOs in seeking a way forward, but also in addressing critical safeguards
    issues.

 c) Planning for implementation delays with forest roads: Projects involving forest
    road rehabilitation probably add 2-3 years to expected disbursement periods. This
    delay can include, i) 18 months for developing and getting consensus on BPGs for
    roads construction and rehabilitation; ii) six months for the preparation of the
    technical specifications (an engineering job); and iii) six months for bidding
    document preparation and the tendering process. These were all useful and
    important processes, the sequencing of which was quite important (i.e. complete
    technical specifications could not be prepared before BPGs were completed).
    Forestry investment programs require a "longer term" development horizon and the
    Bank should acknowledge this up-front by explicitly balancing the portfolio with an
    appropriate mix of both longer term and short term development support to avoid
    unrealistic expectations. Disbursement projections should be heavily loaded on to
    the outer project years.
 d) Clarifying implementation and monitoring responsibilities: Where there are
    overlapping responsibilities for ensuring the technical quality and environmental
    sustainability of contracted works, as with the Roads Rehabilitation activities under
    this project, contract management can be challenging. The PMU reached an
    explicit agreement with the NFA about how to share oversight for supervisory roles
    and responsibilities.
 e) Providing incentives to small private forest owners: A lesson emerging from the
    project is that small-scale forest owners may require initial incentives to form
    associations and grow, such as training and technical support, accessing financing
    through a revolving fund partially funded through member contributions, tapping
    new forest carbon funds, etc.
 f) Building M&E into project preparation and design: It is important that at
    effectiveness, projects have made good progress to establish a robust M&E system
    with a baseline (or clear plans to do so), plus a program and format for regular
    collection of data on input/outputs, processes, institutional development, impacts
    and outcomes
 g) Linking public awareness with government policy: As governments change the
    forest policy framework, it would be useful to link it with public awareness
    campaigns to help foster better understanding and support. At the same time, these
    campaigns need to be carefully targeted at specific audiences to improve efficiency.

  The overall IBRD financing was US$25 million. Prior to closure, US$3.65 million was cancelled, leaving
an undisbursed amount of US$1.19 million. Much of this is likely to be cancelled when final accounts are
reconciled.

Introduction
Under the Forestry Development Project a total of 22 road rehabilitation projects were
undertaken repairing approximately 210 Kilometers of forest roads. At the time of ICR
preparation, data had been collected for 15 of the 22 road projects, the remaining roads
still being finalized. The road projects for which there are data are summarized below in
Table A-5, and are assumed to be representative of the entire road rehabilitation program.

The roads have been rehabilitated for a number of economic benefits:
    ·    To reduce the costs of harvesting (by reducing the tractor extraction distance and
         increasing the accessibility by timber trucks);
    ·    To increase the accessibility to parts of the resource which would otherwise be
         inaccessible to harvesting at all;
    ·    To reduce the environmental damage caused by poorly maintained roads (through
         clogged drains leading to localized flooding and erosion) and by utilizing poorly
         maintained roads, which frequently results in trucks and tractors driving through
         stream beds; and,
    ·    To increase the accessibility for other forest and non forest resources such as
         mushrooms, berries, honey and upland pasture.

This annex tries to assess the economic impact of the first two bullet points. There are
insufficient data to assess the other benefits. The reduced costs of harvesting are
demonstrated by comparing the auction prices for standing timber immediately before
and after the rehabilitation of the road. In all cases where the data are available the
auction price increased. Increased prices can be expected due to the decreased costs for

                                                     25
         the harvesting companies. Where the NFA sold the timber at roadside, their harvesting
         costs decreased, leading to a benefit attributable to the road rehabilitation. Increased
         access to the resource is demonstrated by increased harvesting levels after the road
         rehabilitation was completed.

         Economic Analysis

         Without Road Rehabilitation Scenario
         To estimate the economic impact of the road it is first necessary to assess the baseline
         (i.e. what would have happened if these investments had not been made). In some cases,
         the roads were already totally impassable and harvesting in these areas had completely
         ceased some years previously. In other areas timber was harvested prior to the
         rehabilitation, but at rates less than the allowable cut stipulated in the management plans.
         Local road experts have estimated these roads would also have become impassable in the
         near future, (i.e. in the next two or three years), especially if there is continued
         exploitation. For the purposes of this analysis it has been conservatively assumed that
         these harvestable volumes would decrease linearly over a seven year period. As the
         different road projects were started and completed in different years the production levels
         for the without rehabilitation scenario are staggered by year. The assumed timber harvest
         is shown in Table A-6.

         For the without rehabilitation scenario, it is assumed that there are no associated costs,
         i.e. that the current business practice would prevail and that there would be no investment
         in rehabilitation or maintenance of the roads. The total line in Table A-7 is therefore the
         net cash flow for the without project scenario.

         With Road Rehabilitation
         Following the rehabilitation works in 2007 and 2008, the harvest in most areas served by
         the roads increased. For these years, the actual volumes harvested have been used. In
         subsequent years the annual allowable cut from the management plans have been used. In
         many cases the volumes actually harvested post rehabilitation exceeded the annual
         allowable cut, presumably to take into account the lower production levels in preceding
         years (Table A-8). The revenue from the production shown in Table A-8 is presented in
         Table A-9.


         8
           The prices for the without road rehabilitation scenario are averages taken from the most recent auctions
         prior to the road being rehabilitated. For the with road rehabilitation scenario, the prices are the averages
         taken immediately after the rehabilitation. In most cases this was in less than one year. Average price
         increases in the intervening period due to inflation and increases in real value of timber have not been taken
         into account as data were not available. This may produce a slight over estimate of the net economic gain
         of the with road scenario. In both scenarios, constant prices throughout have been used (i.e. immediately
         prior or post rehabilitation).


                                                                 27
        There are, however costs associated with this revenue stream. These costs include the
        costs of the works of rehabilitation, the routine maintenance that NFA have said that they
        will now undertake, and the cost of periodic maintenance, which it is customary to
        assume for forest roads will be required about once every ten years. The cost of routine
        maintenance has been assumed to be RON 1,400 /Km/yr, and the periodic maintenance at
        10 percent of the current rehabilitation cost. All costs and prices are assumed to be in
        2008/9 values (Table A-10).

        Calculation of NPV and EIRR of the Roads Sub-Component

        To calculate the economic benefit of the roads sub-component, it is necessary to calculate
        a net cash flow of the economic benefits of the roads. The net economic benefits are the
        total benefits from the roads program less the costs of construction and maintenance and
        less the benefits that would have occurred had the program not gone ahead. This is
        summarized in Table A-11. Based on this cash flow, the EIRR comes to 107 percent for
        the whole roads program and the NPV is RON 53 million or US$21 million. This is very
        clearly robust economically. The reason why the rate is so high is because repairing the
        roads gives access to more forest resources (at a lower cost than previously) for a
        relatively low investment. For example repairing a single bridge and modest resurfacing
        can provide access to a resource served by a 40 Km road. The main cost of constructing
        the originally has long since been paid back. The economics of constructing new roads
        rather than rehabilitation is unlikely to be so robust.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

During the ICR mission, a one-day workshop of key stakeholders was organized in
Brasov to provide the team with wider feedback on overall project performance. A
number of short presentations were made to the ICR team, followed by questions and
answers. There was no formal report of this workshop ­ it was designed to simply allow
greater interaction between the mission and stakeholders outside of the planned field
visits during the mission. The PMU incorporated key points from the workshop into the
Borrower's ICR. These included:

·   With the changes in the leadership of central authorities, implementing projects
    through a Management Team is the best way to keep the continuity and the focus of
    the project objectives; staff continuity is an important condition for a PMU to be as
    effective as possible,
·   Procurement and operational management specialists are hard to find. To avoid
    delays in the early implementation of the project, those specialists should be found
    early and trained immediately after the project becomes effective,
·   The POC was an important official institutional link between the PMU and the
    authority, and
·   The monitoring and evaluating system must be done as early as possible.

The participants are listed below.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR

Introduction

The Loan Agreement was signed on January 31st, 2003 and ratified by the Romanian
parliament on September 4th, 2003. The launch of the Forest Development Project was
made in Brasov, on September 16th, 2004. The project became effective in November
2005, and formally closed on June 30th, 2009. The recommended restructuring of the
project was initiated after an official request from the Government of Romania in
October 2007.

Project Background and Main Issues

Project Development Objectives
After the restructuring process, the revised Project Development Objectives are to, i)
improve the management of state-owned forests through capacity building and technical
innovation for environmentally-sustainable and cost effective forest management; and ii)
improve the management of private forests by establishing pilot forest management
institutions and systems for underserved private forest owners.

Project Description and Restructuring
After restructuring, the project supported implementation of four project components,
rather than the five originally envisaged at appraisal. The approach of project changed,
as follows:

Part A. Establish Systems to Ensure Sustainable Management of Private Forest
Lands

This component continued to provide the support envisaged at appraisal, with several
exceptions, a) support for the Forest Inspectorates was being scaled in a manner, more
consistent with the current institutional framework, which involves 9 regional offices of
the Forest Inspectorates, and does not involve forest district offices; b) The expected
national program of support for private forest owners was scaled back to a series of pilot
initiatives. The target groups for these initiatives were private forest owners who operate
small and fragmented holdings, and who are not easily serviced via the more formal
structures that have developed, such as Private Forest Districts. Government chose to
focus on around a dozen pilot forest owners associations, largely comprised of
underserved private forest owners, on developing lessons learned from working with
these associations, and on preparing a strategy for further support for this particular group
of private forest owners. Plans to develop national standards for sustainable forest
management (certification) were dropped, to allow for a wider diversity of standards
development.

The development of the FMIMS proceeded as planned, but Government intended to
complement the work that is underway by developing a Forest GIS, which would
eventually be incorporated into the FMIMS. This was not a significant change in the
original component design. Comprehensive testing was the final and critical phase of the

                                             36
FMIMS completion. This phase started at March 15, 2009, and was largely completed at
the ICR mission.

Part B. Mitigate the Consequences of Restitution on Management of State Forest
Lands

New forest road construction and railway infrastructure rehabilitation activities originally
envisaged at appraisal were dropped. Project activities were limited to rehabilitation of
existing forest roads and reduced in scope from the original number at appraisal (425 km)
to 220 km. The full internal reform of NFA ­ ROMSILVA was still a decision and a
process that will most probably be completed after the completion of the project.
Therefore, greater attention was spent in creating the capacity and the willingness for a
strategic change, rather than to technically assist in the overall reform process itself.
Important steps were already taken in adopting and implementing the strategy.

Part C. Support Increased Productivity and Competitiveness of Forest Industries

This component was originally designed to support the establishment of a part publicly-
funded ForSBIC to provide independent business development and advisory services. It
was dropped during restructuring because of the availability of privately financed
information services of this type. Other Project components (Part D. Build Public Support
for Sustainable Forest Management and Part E. Project Management and Monitoring)
were unchanged. There were no significant changes in the Project's institutional
arrangements, in financing mechanisms, in Project management (in financial
management, or in disbursement/procurement arrangements), or changes to the Project's
Closing Date. The implementation schedule was changed to backload disbursements, in
line with planned contracting for forest roads.

Policy Environment
After the launch of the project, the new Government (in place since January 2005)
approved a new forest restitution law (No 247/2005). This new law enabled former forest
owners to claim and to obtain all their former forestlands, regardless the size of the lands.
In the table below there are some data describing the forest situation before and after the
implementation of this law. Considering that the restitution of the forest is still underway
at this moment, the reliability of those data is limited.

The current forest law requires every forest owner to assure the administration of their
land either through state forest districts or new, private forest districts. Big owners, often
a collection of medium to large parcel-holders, are able to pool resources and meet this
requirement. However, it is estimated that 95 percent of the individuals will be small
owners encompassing up to 7 percent of the forestland who as individuals, may have
problems in administrating their forestland because of pure physical conditions, poverty
or the refusal coming from the forest districts. All those changes affected the
development of the project as follows, a) the emphasis of the ALFO project was revised
in the direction of focusing on small owners ­ giving them tools for administrating and
sustainable developing their forest lands; b) NFA strategic development and reform may
be more dramatic; c) the importance of PR campaign is increasing; the campaign should
target mainly the small forest owners, especially the ones in the urban area; d) the danger
of forest over cutting is increasing so does the possible environmental damages; e) the
regulatory and controlling capacity of the DOFs Territorial Divisions may be not enough;
and f) implementing the GIS into both private and state owned forests tend to become
more and more important and necessary;

Project Risks

During the period of implementation, some major issues affected the project, a) changes
in the territorial structure of the MAFRD: the number of the territorial inspectorates
dropped from 36 to 9, meaning that the actions planned aiming to strengthen their
capacity had to be changed; b) economic development of the country lead to a dramatic
change in the macro-economic indicators with an effect on prices for consultancy and
civil works, therefore, the length of the rehabilitated roads dropped substantially; c)
several changes in the government structure and senior personnel lead to the loss of
ownership or "paternity" of the project, thus there were and still are difficulties in
obtaining senior officials' involvement in the project; d) initial high levels of resistance

and inertia delayed the completion of BPGs for forest roads, with a serious effect in
delaying the works on forest roads; and e) the dissolution of the APPR ­ national
organization of private forest owners led to decreased capacity of the ALFO project to
determine country coverage.

Project Progress

Sustainable Management of Private Forest Lands

Forest Inspectorate

By December 2007, all equipment had been delivered to the Territorial Inspectorates,
including vehicles, computers, non-computer office materials, etc. All the costs for
operations and maintenance for those automobiles were covered by the FDP: 400 liter of
gas for every month, assurance (mandatory and not mandatory), technical revisions, road
taxes, vignette, etc. A Human Resources Development Study (HRDS) was prepared from
June 2005, which outlined training and capacity building needs for Department of Forests
within MAFRD and the Territorial Inspectorates. Based on the needs described in the
HRDS, the ToRs for this training program was designed and implemented, with 12
modules. The total number of participants (in all programs and modules) was 428. The
training program and content of the curricula was highly appreciated by the participants.
The Territorial Inspectorates, as institutions for forest regulation dissemination and
enforcement, started from nothing. Now, those institutions are fully operational,
representing successfully the central authority for forests in the territory. The newly
created ALFOs are now operating and also a model for replication.

Support for Associations of Private Forest Owners

The field and office equipment for the NAPFO was procured and used to improve its
capacity to engage with local forest owners associations. Some of the created ALFOs are
experiencing real success in their activity, applying new skills and development plans
made during the contract execution. For example,

   ·   Marsani Association has increased the number of members and they are now in a
       position to afforest another 800 ha of agricultural land in the biggest afforestation
       site in the country. A very beneficiary contract for administrating the forest has
       been negotiated with local NFA branch. Several members of the association have
       already graduated from the school for forest rangers and are now the guardians of
       the association's forest. Another two associations (Danet, Sadova) were created
       by people in the area using the same pattern of the Marsani ALFO.
   ·   Viisoara Ruget was originally a small association, but is now considered as being
       the strongest association in Vrancea County. In the last two months, the size of
       the association doubled. They succeeded in attracting funds and are also involved
       in cultural activities together with the local high school.
   ·   With support from PMU members, another three associations were created in
       Bihor County: Copacel ­ Ganea, Pomezeu-Campani and Varciorog, another one
       in Dolj county ­ Danet (near one of the already created ALFO ­ Marsani).
       Lessons learned during the contract with SAVCOR were used in the process of
                                            39
       creating those associations. The guide for associations was refined, new annexes
       and guidelines were added aiming to adapt the guidelines to a newly intended
       mechanism in which the role of the Forest Inspectorates is greatly increasing.

Based on the data reported by the Forest Inspectorates in mid-May 2009, there are 183
associations of private forest owners activating in Romania. It is estimated that 67 of
those were created during the implementation of ALFO project and another 22 directly
supported by FDP. Many other associations benefited from the methodology created by
FDP. Another 30 associations are under creation (in different stages of obtaining the
authorizations and licenses).

Forest Management Information and Monitoring System

The contract for FMIMS was signed in November 2005, and the contract for the GIS
feasibility study started in February 2008. The start of the FMIMS implementation was
delayed by a long procurement process for hardware and software that ended in
November 2007. In addition, the MAFRD requested the development of a new system
designed to follow illegal logging using a digital record at all stages of evaluating,
processing and transporting the wood, all over the country. The whole FMIMS is an
innovative tool that will enable the central authority to better assess the needs of the
sector and therefore to better design a new regulatory framework. FMIMS, if adopted by
all the stakeholders, will be an effective tool also for strategic and policy decisions.


Mitigation of Consequences of Restitution on Management of State Forest Lands

Reform and Strategic Development of NFA

The consultant Savcor Indufor Oy Helsinki worked closely with the NFA to help them
start a strategic planning process. The final report was submitted in June 2007. The
strategic proposals for the NFA's strategic development were grouped under six separate
strategy components.

   ·   Strategy Component 1. Determination of ultimate functions, organization
       structure and decision-making bodies for NFA. This process is closely linked with
       the strategy components 2 and 3.
   ·   Strategy Component 2. Identification of key relevant stakeholders and clients.
       This process aims at reducing political and other risks involved in restructuring.
   ·   Strategy Component 3. Formulation of mission, vision, objectives and targets for
       NFA. This process, when completed, will spell out the key choices and objectives
       to lay the foundation for internal development of NFA as well as key legislative
       changes.
   ·   Strategy Component 4. Internal development of NFA. This process deals with
       implementing the actual organization restructuring, establishing the results-based
       management system and developing the human resources.

NFA has already started implementing several measures of the strategy for development,
because it is facing serious difficulties due to their archaic internal organization and the
decline in commercial wood markets during the past several months. Serious reductions
in personnel were undertaken and a new set of performance indicators are on the desk of
the NFA management ready to be implemented. Even if there was no specific objective
within the project for an effective restructuration process within NFA, the project
provided a sustainable strategy formulation, and guidelines for implementation.

Forest Road Construction

The MAFRD and the NFA set a goal to rehabilitate 220 km of access roads. A very
important achievement of the project was the development of a "BPG for Forest Roads".
Two versions of the guidelines were produced; a short version (which has been translated
into English) and a longer version, which includes more detailed descriptions of
environmental mitigation measures, such as revegetating slopes. As requested by the
Environmental Management Plan, and agreed by all the stakeholders, the BPGs were
widely disseminated. The BPG is already used by the NFA as a mandatory part of their
tender documentations.

The first package of 17 forest roads (rehabilitation) was submitted by the designers to
the NFA Commission and approved on March 03, 2005. The bidding documentation
preparation and the tendering process took several months from February to June 2006.
After long negotiations and incorporation of Bank comments into the process the
contracts were signed in mid-September 2006. Due to the winter season precluding road
works, the activity started with big effort in March, 2007 for the roads in the first tranche.
Since that, a careful monitoring and supervising system was in place and the works
evolution was good. All roads were completed as planned. For the second roads
package, the feasibility studies and the technical specifications for the final tranche of the
roads rehabilitation sub-projects were completed in June 2008. By applying the expertise
the PMU and NFA gathered in the first package, the works started immediately on almost
all the roads in the second package.

Several innovative technological approaches appeared in the rehabilitation processes
mainly because of the new vision created by the BPG and the imperative of reducing
costs by:
    · Use of the undulated metal tubing for culverts, rather than traditional cement
        tubing. Several such undulating tubing can be seen in Prahova County roads from
        first tranche (Crasna and Basca fara Cale being already finished) and will also be
        used in Crasna II ­ road from the second tranche. This will decrease not only the
        installation costs, but also the cost of subsequent repair;
    · New state-of­the-art road shaping equipment introduced by JAOP Portuguese
        firm was highly appreciated during the second BPG training session;
    · New and interesting techniques used in Maramures County for gabion
        construction in which a foundation of willow branches was first laid down for
        flexibility. This approach is already in place in several sites, including the ones in
        Neamt County (forest roads Calu and Soimu).



                                             41
No significant environmental damages were reported through the roads rehabilitation
monitoring system. In the same time, the adoption of the BPG by the NFA is also a
guarantee for future new approach regarding environmental protection during the forest
roads rehabilitation and construction process.

Public Support for Sustainable Forest Management

The main focus during the early stages of the campaign was to define the content and
subject to be developed for each material / activity. After refining the message of the
campaign, the focus moved on to the visual identity of the campaign. A web site was
designed (www.forestier.ro) and the first materials published on the site in May 2007.
Promotional materials have continued to be prepared and disseminated. A number of
seminars were held as part of the information component. A spot for the social TV
campaign was prepared and the airing done on several of the national TV stations,
especially on the governmental channels. The airing spot was presented on TV during
July-October 2008. A longer documentary film was prepared and used for all the
meetings of the ministry and also disseminated through the Forest Inspectorates.
Meetings were held with local forest owners in 12 locations all over the country that
guided the ministry in refining its internal regulatory process in order to better address the
problems of the local forest owners.

Project Management

The PMU included a manager, two technical specialists (road and public awareness),
procurement officer, financial management specialist and an assistant. Since September
2006, the PMU added a deputy team leader, and from November 2007 the deputy took
over the responsibilities of the roads specialists that had left the team.

Because of the changes in the top of the ministry, a new Project Oversight Committee
was formed by ministerial order no. 819/28.12.2006. The Committee held four meetings
and provided significant input into broader project direction, restructuring, and policy
linkages. In order to establish a better connection with the MAFRD, the Committee
established a working group inside the ministry for supervising the PMU activity, for
helping the project activities and, most important, to integrate the achievements under
FDP in the general activity of the ministry. Collaboration with members of this group
was fairly good.

Monitoring and Evaluation

Monitoring and Evaluation System
The M&E system design contract was signed in the autumn of 2005 and the final draft
report was finalized and submitted in May 2006. The final report was presented in July
2007, approved by the ministry and paid. The consultants also provided a Follow-up
Implementation Report. With restructuring of the project and PDO, some goal indicators
were changed and analyzed during the supervision mission in spring 2008. Special
attention was to be allocated to the monitoring of the roads rehabilitation and also to the



                                             42
effectiveness of the ITRSVs. The other output indicators do not raise particular issues;
the M&E propose system covering in a satisfactory way the gaps in PMU approach.

Evaluation of the Borrower Performance

Romania is passing through a period of major changes. This period lead to numerous
changes in government and subsequently to numerous changes in the leadership of the
central authority in charge of forestry. The Secretary of State in charge with coordinating
the project was changed 7 times as well as the Minister of MAFRD. For every change,
there was a certain time needed for the new officials to be familiarized with the details of
the project implementation. Those facts affected the pace of project implementation,
especially during the early stages. The same issues were experienced in the NFA. One of
the reasons for the delays in implementing the FDP strategy within NFA is the fact that
the leadership changed so often, creating discontinuities in decision making processes
and contributing to a lack of a unitary strategic view. There were two major
consequences for the project, i) the ministry could not focus on all the real priorities
ahead and therefore sometimes tried to redirect or to address different objectives; and ii)
the regulatory system is very prescriptive and therefore not completely effective.

Evaluation of the Performance of the Bank or Other Partners During Preparation
and Implementation

The Bank's performance during supervisions was highly satisfactory; the involvement of
all the Bank officials that had connection with the project affected implementation in a
positive way.

The performance of the NFA as a partner of the FDP is also considered as excellent. NFA
offered all the technical, organizational and financial support for the roads rehabilitation
program and also for the consultations that ended with the development of the NFA
development strategy.

The performance of the APPR as a partner was unsatisfactory. Because of internal
frictions within this organization, the initial good collaboration declined during
implementation. With strong efforts on the part of the PMU, relations improved by the
end of the project.


Description of Proposed Arrangements for Future Operations of the Project

In order to assure the proper use of the toolkit developed by FDP for the forestry sector in
Romania, the central authority has committed to take further steps in the following
directions:
    · Continue the implementation of NFA internal reform
    · Transform FMIMS in a regular management and decision making tool; establish a
        data -center with IT- specialists within the ministry
    · Continue the permanent monitoring of the TI effectiveness
    · Continuous support for local forest owners associations

                                            43
   ·   Apply the lesson learned from first forestry related awareness campaign
   ·   Continue to apply the BPG for forest roads.

The major priority for the moment is to assure the necessary financial, institutional and
personnel resources for complete implementation of FMIMS as a very fundamental
condition for enabling the authority to create a better regulatory and monitoring system
for the forest sector in Romania with beneficial effects of the quality and policy related
sections of the regulatory framework.
