SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDITS
Borrower:             Republic of Kenya
Credit Amount:        US$55 million equivalent plus
US$15 million equivalent EEC Special Action Credit
Terms:                Standard.  The Special Action Credit would be on
standard IDA terms to the Government.
Credit Description:  The proposed credits would provide support for a program
of economic measures agreed upon with the Government and
outlined in a Letter of Intent from the Government to the
Association designed to adjust the foreign trade regime
and industrial structure. Foreign exchange would be used
for essential imports of raw materials, intermediate
goods, spare parts and balancing equipment. Counterpart
funds would be used for development-related expenditures

Disbursements:      US$35 million (which includes the US$15 milion EEC
Special Action Credit) would be available for disburse-
ment after effectiveness. The remaining US$35 million
would be disbursed after a review of progress in April,
1980.
Procurement           Only goods purchased from Bank Group member countries
Arrangements:        and Switzerland would be eligible for reimbursement.
Purchases by private firms would be on the basis of
normal commercial practices. Purchases by parastatals
would follow Kenya Government regulations but all
contracts in excess of US$5 million would be subject
to international competitive bidding.



INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON PROPOSED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDITS
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed structural
adjustment credit on standard terms for the equivalent of US$55 million and a
proposed EEC Special Action Credit of US$15 million equivalent to the Republic
of Kenya. The latter credit would be made from the EEC Special Action account
in accordance with the terms of the agreement of May 2, 1978 between the
Association and the European Economic Community (EEC).
PART I - KENYA'S ECONOMY IN TRANSITION
2.        A report entitled "Kenya Economic Memorandum" (Report No. 2441-KE)
dated March, 1979 has been distributed to the Executive Directors. A sum-
mary of social and economic data is in Annex I. A Basic Economic Report on
Kenya is now under preparation.
Long-Term Economic Growth and Prospects
3.        Kenya became an independent nation in 1963.  During the entire
period since then the country has experienced remarkable continuity in both
political leadership and development strategy. That strategy has been to
promote rapid economic growth by means of public investment, encouragement
of both smallholder and large-scale farming, and promotion of accelerated
industrialization, by providing incentives for private, including foreign,
investment in modern industry. The Kenyan development model can be charac-
terized as "mixed", in the sense that it incorporates a diversity of
organizational forms and incentives and combines private enterprise with a
significant amount of government participation and guidance. While the death
in 1978 of President Kenyatta, who had led the nation since independence, had
been anticipated with concern because of possible political disruption and
discontinuity in Kenya's development, it is clear t:hat the country has made
a smooth transition to new leadership and that the future will see continuity
in both the political and economic spheres. Recent: peaceful elections provide
additional confirmation of this.
4.        Kenya's first decade as a independent nation was one of remarkable
growth and structural transformation. Total GDP grew at an annual average
rate of 6.6% during 1964-73. Both agriculture and manufacturing grew rapidly,
4.7% and 8.4% respectively. The expansion of agriculture was stimulated by
redistribution of large estates to smallholders, rapid diffusion of hybrid
maize and growth of smallholder output. Growth of manufacturing was very
largely made possible by the expansion of domestic demand due to rising
agricultural incomes, while investment for domestic production was being
encouraged by high levels of protection, a liberal attitude towards foreign
investment and active government promotion of and participation in manufac-
turing ventures.



-2-
5.        Despite this rapid growth, Kenya remains a poor country, still
heavily rural and dependent upon agriculture. Average per capita income in
1978 was US$320 and agriculture accounted for about a third of GDP (1975-77)
and 60% of export earnings (1977). Since the growth of the industrial sector
has been largely confined to the major urban areas, agriculture remains the
principal source of income in the rural areas where 80% of the population live
and work. Thus, while the country has made substantial economic progress in
an atmosphere remarkably free from social unrest, it still has significant
problems of poverty and under-employment. It is estimated that about one-
fourth of the population have incomes which place them below the absolute
poverty line. Moreover, while Kenya's post-independence growth record has
been impressive, a number of problems have been emerging which will make it
more difficult to sustain the rapid growth of domestic product and further
alleviate poverty. These are: the extremely rapid growth of population, the
inward-looking pattern of industrialization and the slow growth of and lack of
diversification of exports.
6.        The most fundamental problems Kenya faces are posed by the rapid
growth of population, currently estimated to be in excess of 3.5% per year,
which is among the highest in the world. This is, ironically, the result
of Kenya's past success in raising living standards which has resulted in a
steady decline in mortality, and has probably resulted in an increase in the
country's already high fertility rate.
7.        With rapidly increasing population, pressure is beginning to  2
mount on K2nya's limited arable land.  Of Kenya's total area, 583,000 km
520,500 km is categorized as potentially agricultural; however, only 13%
can be regarded as high potential land, with 6% medium and 81% low potential.
Thus, less than 20% of the land area has good arable potential. While pres-
sure on the land was alleviated during the years following independence by
the opening up of a large part of the land previously owned by Europeans to
settlement by Kenyan smallholders, much of the high-potential land is now
densely settled. Because of traditional ethnic landholding patterns some
higher potential land is not fully utilized. With population growing at
more than 3.5% per annum, pressure on land is mounting. This is resulting
in increasing subdivision and landlessness in high-potential areas and in
settlement in semi-arid areas ill-suited to farming. The latter also poses
a serious threat of environmental degradation.
8.        Rapid population growth is felt most seriously through the increas-
ing pressure on available agricultural land, but has already created and is
creating other problems as well. First, there is the strong likelihood that,
unless population growth slows dramatically or ways are found to increase the
rate at which income earning opportunities in agriculture expand, excess rural
labor will be pushed into urban areas. Even if the non-agricultural formal
wage sector (which employs less than 15% of the total labor force) grows very
rapidly, it will probably be unable to absorb all the new urban labor force
entrants because of its small base. The result could be rising urban unemploy-
ment and underemployment. Second, considerable budgetary pressure has already
been created by rapidly rising population and the concomitant growth of demand



for social services, especially education. Finally, efforts to improve the
distribution of income will be impeded by the relative lack of access to
land and education for the children of the poorest section of the population.
9.        Another fundamental problem that has been emerging involves the
pattern of the country's industrialization and its effects on export growth
and labor absorption. In general, industrialization has taken place behind
a wall of heavy protection afforded by tariffs, quotas, licensing and other
quantitative restrictions. Rapid growth of industry in the past has been
largely based on investments in fairly simple, import-substitution industries
by multinational companies. To a lesser extent, manufacturing production
was also oriented to the export market in neighboring countries, particularly
the protected East African Community (EAC) market. However, the scope for
further industrialization along these lines is limited, as most of the easy
or economic import-substitution possibilities have been exhausted and the EAC
preferences for Kenyan goods have been abolished. Thus, sustaining rapid
growth by continuing this strategy is not feasible. Moreover, this pattern
of industrialization has had some unfavorable side effects. First, the
industrial sector has become increasingly dependent: on imported raw materials,
components and spare parts. Declines in exports or deteriorating terms of
trade which force reductions of imports, therefore,, have heavy repercussions
on industrial production and employment. Second, the high levels of protec-
tion result in an "anti-export" bias by making it more profitable to produce
for the domestic market than to export. Finally, the structure of production
is relatively capital-intensive and is not sufficiently based on use of
domestic resources, including labor. To maintain rapid industrial growth it
will be necessary to change the system of industrial protection and incentives
to improve the efficiency of the sector and reorient industry toward increased
production for export, and increased use of domestic resources.
10.       As a result of the anti-export bias, exports have grown slowly and
there has been a lack of diversification of exports. Exports have consistently
grown at a slower pace than GDP. From 1964 to 1972 the volume of exports
expanded at an average annual rate of 4.6%. Between 1972 and 1974 export
volume increased by an additional 11% but it has not risen above the 1974
level since then. To some extent this reflects the fact that Kenya's exports
have been adversely affected by the collapse of the EAC and that there have
been production problems in agriculture and industry. Nevertheless, it is
clear that the pace of export growth must be accelerated and exports must
be further diversified if the balance of payments is not to become a major
constraint on long-term growth. This will require that the system of produc-
tion and investment incentives be changed so that more resources are directed
into efficient foreign exchange earning and/or saving sectors.
Recent Economic Performance
11.       The slow growth of exports and the increasing import-dependence
of industry have increased Kenya's vulnerability to developments outside her
boundaries. The country's economic performance over the last five years has
thus been strongly influenced, if not dominated, by dramatic variations in
the international terms of trade.



- 4 -
12.       During 1974-75 the increase in petroleum prices and accelerated
international inflation forced the Government to adopt fiscal, monetary, and
incomes policies aimed at restraining aggregate demand. These policies were
reasonably effective in protecting the country's international liquidity and
in keeping externally-generated price increases from spiralling out of control.
However, they resulted in a sharp slowdown in economic growth, which averaged
only 2.4% per year, compared to 6.6% during 1964-73.
13.       By 1976 another equally dramatic reversal of the country's economic
fortunes was already underway as international coffee prices, which eventually
tripled, were soaring. The Government decided, therefore, to accelerate the
pace of development. The public investment program was stepped up in part by
increasing expenditures needed to replace defunct EAC corporations by national
entities. In addition, a program of military equipment purchases was begun to
build up the country's international security. As a result, the overall
budget deficit rose from less than 5% of GDP in FY1976/77 to an estimated 9%
in FY1978/79. At the same time credit policy was being eased and domestic
credit expanded by an average of nearly 30% per year in 1977-78. Finally
coffee producers were allowed to capture almost all the windfall gains
resulting from the extraordinary rise in coffee prices. The combination of
expansionary fiscal and monetary policy and high agricultural incomes produced
a resurgence of domestic demand. Economic growth accelerated, averaging 7.2%
in real terms in 1976-78 and the value of imports in 1978 exceeded that in
1976 by 85%.
14.       By the second half of 1977 coffee prices had passed their peak and
had begun to decline and the balance-of-payments situation began to deter-
iorate. The Kenyan Government's reaction was to gradually switch to a more
restrictive economic policy. The growth of credit was restrained somewhat
beginning in mid-1978. In the latter months of 1978 import license approvals
were slowed down to limit import growth. The Government negotiated a first
credit tranche Stand-by arrangement which was approved by the IMF in November,
1978. Finally, in December 1978, an advance import deposit scheme was insti-
tuted. However, with a 20% drop in exports due to falling coffee prices and
poor weather and the lagged effect of past expansionary policies on imports,
these measures were too mild and came too late to arrest the deterioration of
the current account balance, which shifted from an exceptional surplus of
US$58 million in 1977 to a deficit of over US$650 million in 1978. As a
result, despite a substantial increase in external capital inflows, foreign
exchange reserves declined by US$200 million in 1978.
15.       In summary, during the period covered by Kenya's Third Development
Plan, 1974-78, the country experienced wide swings in its international terms
of trade and in the growth of the economy: sharp deterioration of terms of
trade and low growth rates during 1974-75; resurgence of growth in 1976-77
following the coffee boom; and, deceleration in 1978-79. Overall, the growth
of the economy was disappointing, averaging only 4.7% per year over 1972-78.
These results reflected the inadequacies of a development strategy and policies
which created an increasingly less viable economic structure. As Kenya begins
execution of its Fourth Development Plan, it faces conditions which are, in
many ways, analogous to those at the beginning of the Third Plan in 1974, i.e.
rising petroleum prices, a slowing world economy and a relatively unfavorable
price outlook for its major exports.

PART II - THE FOURTH DEVELOPMENT PLAN: STIRATEGIES AND PROSPECTS
16.       The emphasis of Kenya's Fourth Development Plan is on restoring
growth to the pace that prevailed before 1974, while alleviating poverty
through creation of income-earning opportunities and provision of social
services to meet the basic needs of the populace, especially in rural areas.
The Plan recognizes that pursuing rapid growth of employment and income
in rural areas will require greater attention to problems of smallholder
agriculture and to expanding rural infrastructure. Further, it recognizes
that the process of industrial modernization and expansion through import
substitution has inhibited the growth of exports, both agricultural and
industrial, and that this process is reaching its limits. The emphasis
of the Plan is thus placed on reducing protection and expanding and diver-
sifying exports.  Finally, the heavy burden rapid population growth is placing
on the economy is acknowledged and measures are proposed to limit growth.
Thus, the Plan correctly identifies the key problems that Kenya faces and
sets forth a development strategy appropriate to' their solution.
17.       Agricultural Strategy.  The Fourth PlaLn recognizes the strong link
between agricultural growth and poverty alleviation; One of the most sig-
nificant changes proposed in the Plan is increasing access to land through
legalizing subdivision of large farms in high-potential agricultural zones.
The Government will also have first option purchase rights on any parcel
of high potential land greater than 20 hectares which is offered for sale.
Any such land purchased by the Government would be made available for lease-
hold settlement of landless farmers. This is a major departure from recent
policy and could have important effects on output employment and income dis-
tribution. Once the status of existing small farms, which had been formed by
illegal subdivision, is regularized, they will become eligible for extension,
credit and other services common in smallholder areas. The Government is also
prepared to assist owners of large farms who wish to subdivide to do so.
18.       The Plan proposes that a National Land Commission be established to
review ways of encouraging land use intensification and labor absorption. The
Plan also proposes that marketing and pricing policies pay closer attention
to the structure of domestic and international prices and that the marketing
system be made more competitive and efficient tio improve prices to farmers.
Research and extension services are to be more closely linked to the needs
of small farmers. Finally, in addition to projects to increase larger scale
commercial and smallholder production, a series of integrated rural development
projects in semi-arid areas is proposed to redress the neglect of these areas.
19.       Industrial Strategy.  The major thrust of industrial policy during
the Fourth Plan period will be to effect a transition from import substitution
to a strategy emphasizing industrial efficiency and export diversification.
The deficiencies of import substitution strategies, including their adverse
impact on income distribution, low employment generation and anti-export bias
were recognized in the Third Plan. That Plan did not, however, contain as
the Fourth does, a definite commitment to a scheduled rationalization of the
protective regime. This will involve further modification of tariffs and



elimination of quantitative restrictions on imports over a five-year period.
This policy will be very difficult to carry forward over the next few years
when, because of balance-of-payments problems, there is likely to be consider-
able pressure to increase, rather than reduce, protection. It is recognized
that reduction of protection and increased industrial efficiency, while
necessary to expanding and diversifying exports, may not be sufficient. The
Plan, therefore, recommends strengthening the Kenya External Trade Authority,
simplifying and rationalizing existing export incentives and adopting an
export credit guarantee and finance scheme.
20.       No fundamental change is proposed in Kenya's traditionally liberal
policy on foreign investment, with the important exception that review and
approval of projects for which special concessions or government participation
are being sought will rely more on economic criteria and will be centralized
in the Ministry of Finance. On the whole, the Plan calls for a more limited
role for Government in terms of direct participation and intervention in the
industrial sector. Development of the informal sector and small industry will
be supported through provision of credit, extension services and technical
assistance and essential infrastructure. Licensing and regulation of small
business will be reviewed to avoid any unfair discrimination. Efforts will be
made to restructure industrial investment incentives to encourage employment
and regional decentralization.
21.       Population Policy.  The Plan is frank in acknowledging the heavy
burden rapid population growth is placing on the development effort and makes
promotion of family planning a matter of public policy of the highest priority.
It calls for a coordinated effort on the part of all relevant ministries and
non-governmental organizations involved in development activities related to
family life to increase public awareness of the desirability of family plan-
ning. The target for new acceptors during 1979-83 is 700,000, compared to
280,000 recruited during 1974-78. In order to achieve this, the number of
field educators will be more than tripled (from 430 to over 1,300) and the
number of fixed delivery points doubled (from 315 to 630). Although Kenya
is doing more to promote family planning than most other African countries,
the rate of population growth is projected to remain extremely high (3.5%)
because of strong cultural and traditional factors affecting fertility and
even greater efforts will be required to bring about a significant decline
in fertility.
Economic Prospects
22.       In spite of the generally well-conceived policy measures proposed
in the Fourth Plan, it will be very difficult to attain the Plan's targets,
especially the target GDP growth rate of 6.3% per annum. This is largely due
to balance-of-payments and budgetary problems which are likely to be more
severe and long-lasting than was foreseen at the time of Plan preparation.
The balance-of-payments position is likely to remain difficult throughout
the Plan period for three reasons. First, export prospects are not favorable
for most of the period. It is estimated that export revenues have increased



- 7 -
only marginally in 1979 after their significant fall in 1978. Coffee export
volumes are down because of poor weather and the recent increase in world
coffee prices has not benefitted Kenya because the normal timing of its
harvest brought the crop to market before the increase in price. Second,
Kenya has also been adversely affected by the most recent round of oil price
increases. It is estimated that the average price being paid for crude oil in
1979 was 38% above that in 1978. The terms of trade are projected to remain
unfavorable until 1982-83. Third, there will be a rapid rise in amortization
payments over the next few years because of the significant increase in the
level of commercial borrowing to finance expenditures associated with equip-
ment of successors to EAC corporations and other large projects   and to carry
out a major program to re-equip the armed forces in 1977-78. Payments asso-
ciated with purchase commitments made during this period will have a substan-
tial impact on the balance of payments throughout the Plan period. The
budgetary situation will also be tighter than foreseen in the Plan. The lower
rate of growth of the economy and of imports will mean lower growth of govern-
ment revenues. In addition, the President has recently announced several
measures which are not included in the Plan but which will have significant
direct budgetary consequences. These measures include: (a) provision of
free milk for students in the first seven years of school; (b) elimination
of school fees for the sixth year of elementary school; (c) initiation of
a national literacy campaign; and (d) a 10% increase in employment in the
public and private sectors in exchange for agreed wage restraint. Payments
on military purchases already made will also increase budgetary pressure.
External Debt
23.       The recent expansion of government and government-guaranteed commer-
cial borrowing has adversely affected the debt service ratio, which has risen
from 5% in 1977 to an estimated 11.2% in 1979. This includes service payments
on a notional 50% share of the debt of EAC corporations. The debt service
ratio is expected to increase to about 16% in the mid-1980's and decline
gradually thereafter. Debt service payments to the Bank are 14.9% of total
debt service payments; the IDA share is 0.9%. The Bank's share of total debt
service payments is expected to rise to about 22% by 1985, while IDA's share
would rise to 1%. The Bank is presently holding 22% of Kenya's total outstand-
ing external debt and IDA 9%. The Bank's share is expected to rise to 26% and
IDA's to 15% by 1985. The expected rise in Bank exposure is due largely to
anticipated repayments of loans with short matu:rities. An additional factor,
however, is the gradual switch by other donors from loans to straight grants
(including conversion of some loans to grants).
Impact of the De Facto Dissolution of
the East African Community (EAC)
24.       The major developments in the East African Community were outlined
in a report to the Executive Directors dated December 29, 1977 (R77-312) and
more recent developments were outlined in a statement to the Executive
Directors at the Board meeting held on January 4, 1979. Dr. Victor Umbricht,



-8-
the independent mediator appointed by the Partner States, is completing his
work on appraising the assets and liabilities of the EAC Corporations. The
establishment of national corporations to replace the former EAC corporations
has in some cases required large expenditures but the burden should be tem-
porary, as the new corporations are expected to become self-financing. The
closure of the border with Tanzania has had some effect on trade -- Tanzania
was a large customer for Kenyan manufactured goods but new markets are being
developed. As Tanzanian exports to Kenya were small, replacing these has not
been a major problem except for specific commodities (i.e. tobacco and cotton).
The border closure has also had a slightly negative impact on tourism, although
Kenya is expected to overcome this by developing additional beach resorts and
game parks within Kenya.
PART III - THE GOVERNMENT'S ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
AND THE PROPOSED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDITS
25.       The Government of Kenya recognizes that external circumstances will
limit the extent to which it can achieve the targets and goals it has set for
itself in the Fourth Development Plan. The growth target incorporated in the
Plan of an average of 6.3% per annum during 1979-83 will no longer be attain-
able; to aim at such a growth path would require import levels which, given
other claims on foreign exchange, would not be possible without excessive
borrowing on unfavorable terms. The Government is determined, nonetheless,
to carry out the important structural reforms and social policies incorporated
in the Plan.
26.       This effort, to be realistic, requires significant adjustments in
the Government's program and policies. It will also require considerable
additional resources to avoid a severe contraction of economic activity. The
Government of Kenya and the Association have, over the past year, discussed
and worked out the necessary adjustments and the outline of an appropriate
program of action. In addition, there was close coordination with the IMF and
the agreements reached with both institutions are complementary. The Government
has taken the policy decisions necessary for the Kenyan economy to adjust to
recent events overseas and at home without sacrificing financial stability or
international creditworthiness, while still preserving the basic thrust of the
Fourth Plan. The Government's adjustment program and policies aim at better
capacity utilization and at making the industrial sector more efficient and
competitive, with particular emphasis on a shift in the pattern of industrial-
ization towards a more export-oriented strategy. The essential elements of
the program adopted by the Government are spelled out in a Letter of Intent
addressed to the Association (Annex IV). The proposed structural adjustment
credit, together with the EEC Special Action credit,would support the Govern-
ment's adjustment program and enable Kenya to strengthen its economy. The
proposed credit and EEC Special Action credit were appraised in July 1979.
Negotiations were held in Washington during December 17-19, 1979. The Kenyan
delegation was led by Mr. Nicholas Ng'ang'a, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry
of Finance, and included Mr. Harris Mule, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry
of Planning and Economic Development.



- 9 -
27.       The Government has been successful in mobilizing some of the addi-
tional resources required. The Governinent has entered into a Stand-by arrange-
ment with the IMF. The arrangement, concluded in August of 1979, which will
be for a period of two years, involves the upper credit tranches, through the
fourth, including the use of the SFF, and will provide an amount equivalent to
SDR 122.5 million (US$157 million at the current IJS$/SDR rate). In addition,
Kenya has been permitted to purchase the equivalent of SDR 69 million (US$89
million) under the Fund's compensatory financing ifacility. Drawings under the
Stand-by arrangement are scheduled quarterly, ending after March 31, 1981. The
performance criteria contained in the arrangement cover only the current Kenyan
fiscal year (1979/80) which ends June 30, 1980. Those for the second year of
the program will be negotiated some time before tlhe end of the current fiscal
year. The quantitative performance criteria in the program cover: (a) net
borrowing by the Government, including loans from the banking system, the
Cereals and Sugar Finance Corporation, and the use of the local currency counter-
part of purchases from the IMF and Eurocurrency loans (use of counterpart funds
from concessionary external borrowing, including program assistance from the
Bank, would not be limited); and (b) domestic assets of the Central Bank (net
credit to the Government plus discounts and advances to the private sector).
28.       In addition to attaining access to IMF resources, the Government has
signed a US$200 million Eurocurrency loan which it views, however, largely as
reserve liquidity. The Government has also asked bilateral donors to convert
part of their planned assistance to balance-of-payments support in the form of
program loans or other forms of rapidly disbursing aid. The Association has
encouraged other lenders to respond favorably to the Government's request and
to shift the composition of their aid programs from project to non-project
assistance. So far, the Netherlands has agreed to provide additional program-
type assistance; other lenders are expected to follow.
29.       The Government's Letter of Intent covers in detail the various
measures to be taken to:  (a) revise the Government's investment program to
make it more realistic; (b) ensure the country's creditworthiness and improve
the management of external debt; (c) reorient the industrial development
strategy through a rationalization of protection; and (d) promote exports.
In our discussions with the Government of the different aspects of the adjust-
ment program, we have reached an understanding on the specific steps which
will lead to the implementation of the Government's intentions and the pro-
posed time frame for these measures. There will be regular exchanges of views
between the Government and the Association on the progress achieved in imple-
menting the program and the various policies. The first such exchange of
views will take place no later than April 30, 1980. The Government will
provide in time for these exchanges of view reports describing the policy
measures taken by the Government and the progress achieved in carrying out the
economic adjustment program (Section 3.05 of the draft Development Credit
Agreement).

Revision of the Government's Investment Program
30.       The Government has adopted a comprehensive economic program aimed
at limiting the loss of foreign exchange reserves to Kl 50 million (US$133
million) for 1979-80 combined and at gradually reducing the rate of inflation
to less than 10% by 1980/81 (compared to 12% in 1978). The major policy
targets involved in accomplishing this will be a reduction in the overall
deficit of the Government from 9% of the GDP to about 6% in 1979/80, a sub-
stantial reduction in domestic borrowing by the Government, a moderate expan-
sion of credit to the private sector, and a continuation of incomes' policy
which holds wage increases below the inflation rate. In support of this pro-
gram the 1979/80 budget includes a 50% increase in the rate of sales tax (from
10% to 15%) and increases in the sales tax on nonessential items (from 20% to
25%), as well as increases in specific taxes on a variety of products, includ-
ing motor vehicles and petroleum, and increases in various license fees. The
tax increases are estimated to yield an amount equivalent to 10% of 1978/79
revenues or roughly 1.6% of GDP. (Kenya's overall tax burden is already high,
averaging about 25% of GDP in recent years.)
31.       Because of the less favorable prospects for GDP growth and the like-
lihood of lower revenues than had been expected when the Plan was drafted,
the Government has decided to scale down its expenditure targets for the Plan
period. The 1978/79 and 1979/80 fiscal budgets reflect the slowdown of eco-
nomic growth. Fiscal revenues in 1978/79-1979/80 were about 8% below Plan
estimates. As a result, despite the greater use of external resources than
had been anticipated, there has had to be a substantial scaling down of
expenditures in the first two fiscal years of the Plan: 1978/79 expenditures
were 4.2% below Plan levels and 1979/80 budget is 12% below.
32.       Recognizing the country's changed economic circumstances, the Govern-
ment is reformulating its expenditure plan for the remaining three fiscal years
of the Plan (1980/81-1982/83). This is being done through the preparation of
a new three-year Forward Budget for this period. The growth rate used in pro-
jecting government revenues and expenditures for the Forward Budget is 5.4%,
compared with the Plan target of 6.3%. In drawing up their expenditure pro-
posals for the Forward Budget, the individual ministries have been instructed
to:
(a) give priority to promotion of exports, to increasing domestic
production of agricultural commodities and to use more labor-
intensive techniques;
(b) reduce the rate of growth of administrative services and social
services and infrastructure, concentrating instead on projects
and programs which promise more immediate returns in added
production and employment; and
(c) review programs and projects in the Development Plan both in
relation to new information on costs and benefits and in rela-
tion to revised economic guidelines.



- 11 -
Furthermore, the ministries have been asked to restructure their expenditures
in such a way that sufficient funds will be available for the completion of
approved ongoing projects and for the operation and maintenance of existing
facilities.
33.       The draft Forward Budget which has emerged from this process is
presented in summary form in Table 1. It implies that total expenditures
during the Fourth Plan will be about 7% in real terms below the level ori-
ginally planned. More than 80% of the reduction will be in the "development
account". This results largely from postponing new project starts and reduc-
ing the planned level of Government equity investments and direct loans to
private enterprises.
34.       The revised allocation of expenditures between ministries presented
in Table 2 reflects the changed sectoral emphasis responding to the change
in the economic circumstances. As compared to the pattern of expenditures
during the last Plan period, the revised program f'or the Fourth Plan period
places considerably less emphasis on construction of new infrastructure and
purchase of equipment (as evidenced by the smaller shares of the Ministry of
Works and the Ministry of Power and Communication) and gives greater priority
to agriculture and rural development, including water supply. The revision
of allocations also reflects policy decisions which were not anticipated in
the Plan. Principally this involves increased outlays for education necessi-
tated by the elimination of school fees and the introduction of a school milk
program; it also involves an increase in military expenditures, which are
expected to peak in 1980/81 and decline in real terms thereafter. It should
be noted that while military expenditures will be considerably higher than
during the Third Plan, the level of military expenditures is not out of line
with the average for LDCs. Kenya's military expenditures were estimated to
be 1.3% of GNP in 1975, compared to an average of 5.1% for all developing
countries.
35.       The Forward Budget is soundly conceived.  It reflects realistically
the country's economic circumstances, the less promising economic growth
prospects, more limited resources, and the more serious foreign exchange
constraint. The shift in the sectoral allocation is appropriate and responds
adequately to the need for raising the level of output and foreign exchange
earnings quickly. The shift of emphasis away from the initiation of new,
capital-intensive investments to the completion of ongoing projects and the
adequate provision of resources for the operation of existing facilities,
is particularly important. In the past there have been problems of capacity
being underutilized because of shortages of funds for operation and maintenance
which should now be remedied. The Government's program thus embodies policies
which should be effective in promoting the objectives crucial to the further
progress of the Kenyan economy: the more rapid increase of exports; more
efficient use of domestic productive resources, in particular labor; and
higher capacity utilization.

36.       The details of the Forward Budget were expected to be completed
by the end of 1979. However, following the recent election there has been
a reorganization of ministries. Some functions have been divided among
several ministries. These changes delayed the completion of the detailed
expenditure programs by the various ministries. We do not expect, however,
that the expenditure levels or the functional allocation will be affected
or that the scope of the program and the broad distribution of funds will
differ from the outline reflected in Tables 1 and 2. The detailed provisions
of the completed Forward Budget will be among the subjects to be reviewed by
the Association no later than April 30, 1980. (Section 3.05(a) and (b) of
the draft Development Credit Agreement and Para. 1 of Schedule 3.)
External Borrowing and Debt Management
37.       The Government is aware of the limited capacity of the country to
service non-concessionary external debt. Because of the precariousness of
the balance of payments the Government has recently borrowed US$200 million
on the Eurocredit market, but it has stated its intention to minimize draw-
ings on this loan and to treat this loan essentially as part of its external
reserves. In view of the onerous terms of such commercial borrowing, the
Government intends to minimize recourse to this market. Specifically, the
Government has stated that it is not its intention to use external commercial
borrowings for budgetary support through the end of the 1980/81 fiscal year
ending in June 1981 over and above the US$200 million Eurocredit Loan.
38.       The Government recognizes that there are shortcomings in its con-
trol over external borrowing. It has taken several measures to improve its
debt management. A comprehensive survey of all debt outstanding of govern-
ment corporations, statutory boards and other public enterprises is underway
to establish the exact amount of public and publicly guaranteed debt obliga-
tions. The machinery for the processing and approval of external borrowings
and the staff of the Treasury are being strengthened to provide for effective
coordination between the Treasury, the Ministry of Planning and Economic
Development, and the Central Bank of Kenya, and for the recording of all
public and publicly-guaranteed debt. The Government is expecting to receive
short-term technical assistance for improving the operations of the external
debt division of the Treasury. The Central Bank will have the responsibility
for monitoring private foreign debt. For this purpose it will maintain a
register of all private external debt in excess of KSh one million and of
longer than one year maturity incurred by corporations or individuals.
39.       The Letter of Intent of the Government states that the Government
has decided to institute annual programs for new public and publicly-guaranteed
borrowing beginning with the next fiscal year, 1980/81. Realistic limits will
be set by the Government on new borrowings by maturity with the objective of
maintaining debt service obligations at a prudent level. In reviewing the
progress of the Government's adjustment program the Association will cover the
improvements of external debt management. The first review by the Association
will focus in particular on the need for technical assistance in this area and
the strengthening of the staff of the Treasury and the Central Bank (Section
3.05(b) and Schedule 3 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).

Rationalization of Protection and Production Incentives
40.       The major thrust of industrial policy in the period covered by
the new Plan will be to bring about a transition from highly-protected
import-substitution to a strategy which will result in greater use of dom-
estic resources, greater employment generation and more rapid and diversi-
fied growth of exports. It is recognized that this will require making the
industrial sector more efficient and competitive. This will in turn require
rationalization of tariffs and elimination of quantitative restrictions on
imports. The Plan calls for gradual phasing out of quantitative restric-
tions and for making the tariff the major form of protection. Moreover,
tariff rates would, in general, be made more uniform and moderate. This
strategy implies that more reliance would be placed on the exchange rate
and other incentives to guide production and investment decisions. The
Government has stated in the Letter of Intent that: an intensive study of
the exchange rate will be undertaken and that it expects to reach agreement
with the IMF on an appropriate level of exchange rate. The effect of such a
strategy would be increased incentives for more efficient import-substituting
and export-oriented industry and for domestic agriculture.
41.       However, such a fundamental reorientation of policy, in addition
to being complex, is likely to have strong adverse effects on some existing
firms. It is, therefore, essential that rationalization of trade and tariff
policies be complemented by measures to assist firms with transitional prob-
lems. Many existing firms are relatively inefficient and could neither export
nor afford to buy high-cost domestic inputs unless the incentive structure
were changed and their efficiency improved.
42.       Among the first steps taken by the Government to initiate the reform
of the protective regime has been the decision to discontinue the issuance of
so-called "Letter of no Objection" privileges to Kenyan enterprises. This
privilege, which is considered the most pernicious aspect of the present
system, gives a firm the right to prevent all imports which it views as a
threat to its own market. There are at present approximately 60 firms account-
ing for a significant proportion of total industrial output which have been
granted "Letter of no Objection" privileges. The Letter of Intent states
that the Government will examine in detail the provisions of all existing
investment agreements which include this privilege and issue guidelines as to
how these might be phased out. This would be a considerable accomplishment,
since it would mean ending a grant of quasi-monopoly power to many large,
influential firms which would now be exposed to some competition.
43.       The rationalization of protection would further involve standard-
izing and reducing the level of protection. This will require a review of
existing tariffs and quantitative restrictions to determine the level and
variability of protection; development of recommendations for the system of
protection to be implemented, including appropriate provisions for import
substituting industries, export industries and producers of agricultural
inputs; determining the impact of the new system on import levels and on
individual firms; and, preparing proposals to help the economy and the indi-
vidual firms adjust to the new regime. The present state of knowledge about
the cost structure of Kenyan firms and about the actual level of effective



- 16 -
protection is inadequate. These studies are, therefore, an absolute pre-
requisite to carrying out an equitable and meaningful reform. The Government
has obtained UNDP financing for technical assistance to carry out these
studies and the Association has seconded a staff member to the Government for
this purpose. The Government has also prepared a schedule for carrying out
the studies and implementing the reform. The schedule calls for completion
of studies and recommendations by the end of 1980 and for phasing in of the
new trade regime by the end of 1983.
44.       The Government is also taking steps to improve the administration
of industrial investment incentives. It has decided that a systematic review
of all proposed projects be undertaken by the New Projects Committee composed
of representatives of the Ministries of Finance, Planning, Commerce and Indus-
try, the Central Bank and the ministry or ministries most directly concerned
with the project, to determine its technical, financial and economic viability
before any decision by the Government on incentives, financial assistance or
participation, or special treatment with regard to foreign exchange transac-
tions, is made. It is preparing standardized guidelines for this purpose.
45.       The Government is also concerned about the efficiency of the para-
statal sector. The rapid growth of government enterprises and corporate
entities in which the Government is a principal shareholder has not been
accompanied by the development of adequate managerial capacity. As the Letter
of Intent states, the Government has made arrangements to monitor the opera-
tions of the parastatals more closely; it will also issue strict guidelines
to govern the further growth of the parastatal sector. These measures should
contribute to an increase in the level of efficiency in this important field.
46.       In reviewing the progress of the adjustment program, the Association
will follow closely the various steps now being introduced by the Government
to rationalize the protective system and improve the efficiency of the indus-
trial sector. The reviews will cover specifically the implementation of
measures to phase out "Letter of no Objection" privileges and the progress
of the tariff studies (Section 3.05 and Schedule 3 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).
Promotion of Exports
47.       Kenya's total export volume has grown quite slowly since 1971, at
an average of 2.8% per annum. Exports were very adversely affected by the
disintegration of the EAC and the steady decline of exports to that market,
which in 1972 accounted for about one-quarter of Kenya's exports. Overall
export growth has also been held down by the slow expansion in the volume
of exports of petroleum products which are refined in Kenya for shipment to
neighboring countries. The encouraging aspects of export performance have
been the steady expansion of coffee and tea exports and, even more importantly,
the expansion in exports of "other" goods to non-EAC markets. These items
include cement, canned pineapples, corned beef, pyrethrum extract, tanned hides
and skins, and insecticides. While this category is still relatively small,
about 20% of exports in 1977, it represents the cutting edge of export growth
and diversification and is a good indication that Kenya has the capacity to
expand exports into new products and new markets.



- 17 -
48.       The Government recognizes that in order to sustain acceptable rates
of GDP growth, exports must be expanded. The Letter of Intent emphasizes
that the Government will ensure that there is sufEicient incentive for pro-
duction of exportables and that their prices will be competitive on world
markets; the Letter of Intent also describes the measures proposed to support
a stronger export effort. Reduction of the anti-export bias in ,he trade
regime and increased industrial efficiency, while necessary for mounting a
sustained export drive, will not be sufficient to attain a rapid growth and
diversification of exports. The country suffers from many of the handicaps
common to "new" exporters, e.g., transportation difficulties, unfamiliarity
with requirements of potential markets, lack of commercial channels, insuffi-
cient export financing or insurance. The present system of export subsidies
is complex and has been of limited effectiveness because of the cumbersome
administrative process associated with it; exporters cannot be certain that
they will qualify for the incentives provided by the scheme. The Government
will now simplify the administration of the incentive system and ensure that
it provides greater certainty to the exporters. Appropriate measures are
being developed and will be introduced in the next fiscal year, 1980/81.
49.       The Government also proposes to introduce an export insurance and
finance system. The Kenya External Trade Authority and the Kenya National
Trading Company, an export agency, are being strengthened. The Kenya External
Trade Authority has completed, with UNDP assistance, a proposal for the estab-
lishment of an export insurance and financing program. This proposal will be
reviewed by consultants who will be employed by the Government no later than
March 1, 1980, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association (Section
3.06 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). The Government expects that
an export insurance and financing scheme will be introduced by September 1980.
Progress in the design of the system and plans for the simplification of
export incentives will be reviewed by the Association as part of the regular
progress reviews (Section 3.05 and Schedule 3 of the draft Development Credit
Agreement).
50.       The Bank Group is at present considering a request for a loan to
cover the cost of technical assistance for marketing and feasibility studies
of export-oriented projects. Financing would be provided for studies abroad
to identify how and where industrial exports can be marketed and for feasi-
bility studies required for specific industrial products and projects with
export potential.
Interest Rates
51.       The Government wishes to ensure that the structure of interest
rates is consistent with its development objectives. For this purpose, the
Government is undertaking a review of its interest rate policy which should
identify modifications required to improve its effectiveness in promoting
economic development, in particular increasing the availability of financial
resources to small farmers, small entrepreneurs and potential exporters.
Terms of reference for the study have been prepared and are acceptable.
Consultants have been contracted to prepare a background paper which will
provide the Government with information, analyses and recommendations as a



- 18 -
basis for its deliberations and for the formulation of policy. The review is
expected to be completed in April 1980. The level and structure of interest
rates in Kenya will be among the subjects to be discussed by the Borrower and
the Association as part of the regular progress reviews.
The Impact of the Program on the Balance of Payments 1/
52.       The various elements of the adjustment program described in the
Letter of Intent and discussed above constitute a sensible approach to the
problems which Kenya faces. Some issues will still need study before specific
operational measures can be defined; on these there will be an active exchange
of views with the Association. The proposed policies should have a favorable
impact on the Kenyan economy and balance of payments during the period ahead.
It is not possible to assess the precise magnitude or timing of the impact
on the balance of payments but it is reasonably certain that the large 1978
deficit on current account will be reduced progressively over time as a
proportion of GDP and also absolutely in real terms. The deficit in nominal
terms should decline from the equivalent of US$655 million in 1978 to US$525
million in 1980; it is projected to go down further to US$484 million in 1983,
the end of the Plan period (Table 3).
53.       The current account deficit in 1980 of US$525 million assumes
that tight monetary and fiscal policy will result in a continued drawdown of
inventories imported in 1977-78, and the overall rise in imports would be
slight, while coffee and tea prices, and, therefore, exports are higher than
in the previous year. The need to finance amortization payments and a modest
recovery of foreign exchange reserves would bring the total external financing
requirement to US$713 million. Non-loan capital inflows are expected to bring
US$96 million, leaving US$617 million to be financed by international borrow-
ing. Normal bilateral and multilateral loans should provide about half of
this; loans from suppliers and financial institutions, somewhat more than
one-fourth; the balance, slightly less than one-fourth, would be provided
by utilization of IMF resources and the proposed IDA credit and EEC Special
Action Credit (Table 4).
1/   The projections in this section were prepared before the latest round of
oil price increases. The effect of these would be to raise the country's
net oil import bill as follows: 1980, US$41 million; 1981, US$52 million;
1982, US$67 million; 1983, US$85 million; 1984, US$106 million; and 1985
US$131 million.

Proposed Structural Adjustment Assistance              70
The proposed IDA credit and EEC Special Action Credit will, in addition,
through counterpart funds generated by the sale of the foreign exchange
provided, supplement the budgetary resources available to the Government
of Kenya. This will permit higher levels of public investment and other
development-oriented expenditures than would otherwise be possible.
54.       It would be difficult for the Government to go ahead with the
adjustment program without the support provided by the proposed IDA credit
and EEC Special Action Credit. The adjustment process will extend over a
number of years. At this time the objectives have been defined and initial
decisions and policy actions have been taken by the Government; further policy
decisions will be taken as the studies now underway produce results and
indicate necessary changes. Continued support through the effective transfer
of external resources will be required in the years ahead if the program is
to be successful; further structural adjustment assistance, if appropriate,
industrial sector lending, or to some extent DFC operations designed to assist
firms in adjusting to the new trade regime could be the vehicle for the trans-
fer of these resources.
Allocation of the Structural Adjustment Credits
55.       Foreign Exchange - The proposed credits would provide US$55 million
of IDA resources and US$15 million of EEC Special Action Funds to help
finance imports of raw materials, intermediate goods, spare parts and small
capital goods items for the industrial and agricultural sectors. These are
defined to include goods in categories 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the SITC as speci-
fied in Annex V.  It is estimated that eligible imports in 1980 will total
about US$1.2 billion. The proposed credits would finance about 6% of this,
thus ensuring quick disbursement.
56.       Counterpart Funds - The Kenya Shilling equivalent generated by the
sale of foreign exchange to importers provided by the credits would be credited
to a special account in the Central Bank and would be used for development
purposes in the Central Government budget. While the exact use of these funds
has not been specified, the Government has stated that it intends to use them



- 21 -
to augment the resources available for agricultural extension, road maintenance
and other rural-oriented program (Section 3.02 of the draft Development Credit
Agreement).
57.       The credits would be disbursed in two tranches, US$20 million of IDA
funds and US$15 million of EEC resources would be available for disbursement
after the credit is declared effective, the remaining US$35 million of IDA
funds would be available for disbursement after a review of performance in
April, 1980 (Schedule 1, para. 2(f) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
It is hoped that the entire amount could be disbursed by June 30, 1980 (the
end of the current Kenyan fiscal year).
58.       There will be a comprehensive review of the Government's implemen-
tation of the economic program in April, 1980. Before disbursing the second
tranche there would have to be a finding that satisfactory progress was
being made in carrying out the commitments contained in the Letter of Intent
and more specifically those listed in Schedule 3 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement (Section 3.05(a) and(b) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement).
59.       Disbursement and Procurement.  The proposed credits would reimburse
the C and F cost of eligible imports on the basis of evidence that they were
paid for by the Central Bank and imported. Disbursement would be made on a
reimbursement basis, against full documentation, including original invoices
returned to the Central Bank of Kenya under existing regulations controlling
the allocation of foreign exchange. No reimbursement would be provided
against imports for which other sources of financing have been secured.
Procurement under the IDA credit would be made from Bank Group member countries
and Switzerland. Procurement under the Special Action Credit would be limited
to imports supplied from the nine EEC countries or any developing country
which is a member of the Association and a potential recipient of a Special
Action Credit (Section 2.02(b) of the draft Special Action Credit Agreement).
The funds would be made available for purchases by private firms and para-
statals. Procurement by private firms would follow their normal commercial
practice. Procurement by parastatals would follow Kenyan Government regula-
tions which ensure reasonable prices. However, purchases in excess of US$5
million would be through procedures ensuring broad international tendering and
would be awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder. The latter contracts would
be subject to post review, i.e., a brief report containing evidence that it
was let in accordance with the guidelines would be provided prior to or with
the withdrawal application. The commercial sector in Kenya is sufficiently
di-iersified and competitive to ensure efficient procurement, and, in line with
standard practice in Kenya, all invoices eligible for disbursement would have
already passed preshipment quality and quantity inspection by the General
Superintendence Company of Switzerland. A minimum value of KSh 20,000 is
proposed for eligible invoices (Schedule 1, para. 2(e) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement.)
60.       Reimbursement would not be permitted iEor goods imported and paid
for before January 1, 1980 (Schedule 1, para. 2(c) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).



- 22 -
61.       In summary, the principal benefit of these credits is that they provide
support and encouragement for a process of structural adjustment involving
rationalization of the system of industrial protection and export incentives.
This will lead to a pattern of industrialization which is more appropriate in
terms of factor use and more equitable in terms of incomes generated and will
contribute to more rapid and diversified development of exports. The direct
support comes through provision of additional foreign exchange resources
which will allow the Government more room for maneuver in adjusting the trade
regime.  Equally important, however, is the fact that the credits have provided
an effective vehicle for an ongoing dialogue on economic policy and for the
provision of technical assistance, including seconded staff.
62.       The principal risk of the credits is that the rationalization
of industrial protection and incentives, which is the key element of the
Government's long-term development strategy, would not be carried out in
its entirety. The program must be executed in a period when, because of
balance-of-payments stringency, there would be a natural reluctance to make
significant changes in the trade regime. In addition, the Government would
undoubtedly come under pressure from firms adversely affected by the reform.
PART IV - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN KENYA
63.       Hitherto, Kenya has received 33 Bank loans, including three on Third
Window terms, and 27 IDA credits amounting to US$994.1 million, supporting 52
operations. In addition, Kenya has been one of the beneficiaries of 10 loans
totalling US$244.8 million which have been extended for the development of
common services (railways, ports, telecommunications and finance for industry),
operated regionally for the three Partner States of the East African Community.
Annex II contains summary statements of Bank loans and IDA credits to Kenya
and to the East African Community Corporations, and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects as of December 31, 1979.
64.       The Bank Group has assisted the Government in its efforts to restruc-
ture the economy through increased lending in directly productive sectors,
particularly agriculture. While recent sector and economic work has also
focussed on the adjustments which Kenya must make to deal with the changed
international economy, the upcoming Basic Economic Report is expected to
comprehensively address the issues of income distribution, population growth,
and appropriate long-term agricultural and industrial policy.
65.       Significant progress has been made in giving the Bank's lending
program a rural focus, and in concentrating on employment and income distri-
bution objectives. Projects approved since July 1978 include an Engineering
Project (Olkaria Geothermal), a Narok Agricultural Development Project, a
Sugar Rehabilitation Project, a Rural Water Supply Project, a First Tele-
communications Project, a Highway Sector Project, a Smallholder Coffee
Improvement Project, a Second Integrated Agricultural Development Project,
the Baringo Semi-Arid Pilot Project and the Olkaria Geothermal Power
Project. A fisheries project, a fourth line of credit to the Industrial

Development Bank and the First Technical Assistancie Project have been appraised.
All of these projects are expected to be ready for consideration by the
Executive Directors later this fiscal year. In addition, a railways project
has been appraised, while an urban transport project, a fifth education
project, an industrial project for expansion of soda ash production and a
second population project are under preparation.
66.       Overall, project implementation performance is satisfactory.
Progress on the Group Farm Rehabilitation Project, however, has been slow due
to administrative difficulties and reluctance of group owners to participate.
Kenya has also experienced serious cost overruns, most notably on road con-
struction projects, but Government has made funds available to complete these
projects. Current cost estimates for the Bura Irrigation Settlement Project
(now in the preliminary stages of implementation) indicate that heavy cost
overruns are likely to be incurred; the financial consequences are under
discussion with the Government and the co-financiers.
The Program Loan of 1975
67.       Kenya has previously received a program loan, No. 1117-KE, dated
May 27, 1975.  That loan was designed to support the Government's efforts
to restructure the economy as a response to the sharp deterioration in the
country's international terms of trade following the oil price increases in
1973-74. Largely because of its timing and the evolution of external events,
this loan turned out to be less critical than anticipated. By the time the
loan was made in mid-1975, restrictive monetary and fiscal policies had
already been implemented. While this resulted in a sharp slowdown in the rate
of growth of the economy, it did stabilize the balance of payments. Shortly
thereafter, the country's external position began to improve dramatically
because of the rise in world coffee prices.
68.       Nevertheless, the Government did, in connection with the "Restruc-
turing Program" which the loan was designed to support, take a number of
useful first steps to deal with the longer-term structural problems of the
economy. The shilling was depreciated, a more restrictive wage policy was
introduced, increases in fuel prices were passed along to consumers, the
Government began linking domestic agricultural producer prices more closely
to world prices and moderate duties were introduced on intermediate and
capital goods as the first step toward a more uniform tariff regime.
69.       The Program Performance Audit Report on the Kenya Program Loan
distributed to the Executive Directors on December 21, 1977 concluded that:
(a) although the country's balance-of-payments situation
eventually turned out to be markedly less serious than
described in the appraisal report, the additional foreign
exchange provided by the loan was clearly justified; and
(b) while the Government did carry out the agreed measures
and the loan thus achieved its immediate objectives, the
effect on performance would depend on whether the policies
continued to be pursued.

International Finance Corporation (IFC)
70.       IFC has committed a total of US$42.9 million for four companies in
Kenya: Pan African Paper Mills, Ltd.; Kenya Hotel Properties, Ltd.; Tourism
Promotion Services (Kenya) Ltd.; and Rift Valley Textiles (Ltd.). A credit
line for medium- and small-scale enterprises was extended to the Commercial
Bank of Kenya. As of September 30, 1979, IFC held for its own account US$32.1
million comprising US$24.1 million of loans and US$8.0 million of equity. A
summary of IFC investments in Kenya is included in Annex II.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
71.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Kenya
and the Association, the draft Special Action Credit Agreement between the
Republic of Kenya and the Association (acting as administrator of the Special
Action Account), the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Special conditions of the
credits are listed in Annex III, Section III. The condition of disbursement
of the second tranche is that the Government shall be making satisfactory
progress in carrying out commitments undertaken in its Letter of Intent and
in executing its economic program (Section 3.05 and Schedule 3).
72.       I am satisfied that the proposed credits would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
73.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credits.

C. Projects in Execution 1/
(As of December 31, 1979)
There are currently 33 projects under execution in Kenya.
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Loan No. 993-KE - Tea Factories: US$10.4 million Loan of June 5, 1974;
Effective Date: September 23, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Although international tea prices have dropped from the extra-
ordinarily high figures in 1976/77, growers continue to show considerable
interest in tea as a cash crop. Yields continue to rise, and from 1979/80
onward the appraisal projections are likely to be exceeded. The project
factory building program is behind schedule and, due to cost escalations,
funds from the Bank and Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) loans will
cover only 12 of the 17 factories included in the project. However, the OPEC
Special Fund has agreed to finance the foreign exchange cost of 3 factories
under the project, and CDC has agreed to provide additional financing for the
remaining 2 factories. CDC has also advanced financing for their Fourth Plan
covering factories outside the project, and by June 1980 a total of 15 fac-
tories (12 under the project and 3 others) will be operative. The standard
of Kenya Tea Development Authority's management continues to be high, and
institutional improvements together with strengthened staffing should further
improve performance. An economic analysis of the project indicates that
despite substantial cost increases the economic rate of return on investments
in new tea factories is over 40%.
Credit No. 477-KE - Livestock:  US$21.5 million Credit of June 5, 1974;
Effective Date: December 2, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
Project implementation has been slow and recruitment of ranches is
very much behind appraisal estimates. In spite of the satisfactory livestock
price structure which was adopted in early 1978, removing the most serious
constraint to ranch development and viability, recruitment of ranches continues
to be slow. Some progress has been made in organization of the pastoralists
in the range development components. In addition, Government services in
ranch water development planning and in the company ranch sector have been
improved. Only two commercial ranch loans and eight company ranch loans were
approved in 1978/79, and the Agricultural Finance Corporation's disbursements
for coast company ranches are being held up pending agreement on satisfactory
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress on projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

security arrangements. Group ranch loan processing also remains slow, and
unless there is a substantial improvement in extension services in the pas-
toral areas, particularly in Masailand, the project goals of adoption of more
commercial and efficient livestock production will be difficult to achieve.
The project continues to be kept under close review.
Loan No. 1093-KE/Credit No. 537-KE - Group Farm Rehabilitation Project:
US$7.5 million Loan and US$7.5 million Credit of March 26, 1975;
Effective Date: September 30, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The Project faces major problems. Few new farms have come under
rehabilitation in the past two years for a variety of reasons: legal, social,
political, and financial. Physical rehabilitation work on participating
mixed farms and coffee estates is satisfactory. Coffee estates are achieving
recoveries in yields, and mixed farms are generally expanding areas cropped
and improving grazing. However, achievement of a satisfactory rate of finan-
cial rehabilitation on most mixed farms is in doubt. The recommendations of
the Large Farm Sector Study (financed under the Project) have prompted Govern-
ment to make a major review of its policies, and although reaching a consensus
has proved difficult, Government expects to take a position on the large farm
sector in the near future. Upon clarification of Government policy, the Bank
and the Government expect to undertake a joint review to see whether the
original project objectives can still be attained. Pending this review, no
further recruitment of mixed farms will take place.
Loan No. 1132-KE/Credit No. 565-KE - Second Forestry Plantation
Project: US$9.9 million 1I Loan and US$10.0 million Credit of June 27,
1975; Effective Date: September 25, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The Project is a continuation of the first Kenya Forestry Plantation
Project (Loan 641-KE), to complete the Government's target long-term afforesta-
tion program of 130,000 ha of sawlog and 24,000 ha of pulpwood plantations by
1980. The planting program is proceeding steadily; the cumulative total to
date is 25% below target, due to a variety of reasons, including bad weather
and poor management. The building and labor housing programs are both con-
siderably behind schedule. There has been little progress in the implemen-
tation of most of the covenants of the Credit Agreenment, particularly
regarding the sawmilling sector, the national land use study, the gazetting
of nature reserves and the study of stumpage rates for sawlogs. Government
is now providing very adequate budgetary allocations. Procurement is proceed-
ing normally. Disbursements and total Project expenditure are both ahead of
schedule. The Credit is now fully disbursed and the Loan should also be fully
disbursed before the end of 1980. A phase III project is envisaged, but many
issues must be clarified before appraisal can take place.
1/   Net of cancellation; an amount of US$0.1 million was cancelled on
July 20, 1979 since items which were to have been financed under
the loan were not procured in accordance with Bank guidelines.

Loan No. 1303T-KE/Credit No. 650-KE - Integrated Agricultural
Development Project:  US$10.0 million Loan and US$10.0 million
Credit of July 9, 1976; Effective Date: March 15, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The cha-ged focus of the project towards assisting large numbers
of subsistence farmers rather than progressive smallholder farmers has led to
a number of difficulties,, but the objective of improving the productivity and
incomes of smallholder farmers continues to be met. Late release of credit
funds in the past led to delayed application of farm inputs and expected yield
increases were therefore not achieved; measures have now been taken to ensure
availability of credit funds at the appropriate time. Steps are also being
taken to improve the low rates of credit repayment and loanee reparticipation.
The overall balance between numbers of loanees and infrastructural support--
staff, storage and transport--at cooperative union level has been improving,
and active efforts continue to be made to improve input supplies and marketing
systems.
Loan No. 1389-KE - South Nyanza Sugar Project: US$25.0 million
Loan of April 15, 1977; Effective Date: November 3, 1977:
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
Agricultural development has advanced well; land clearance has been
completed in about 51% of the area, and 3,725 ha have been planted. Yields
from outgrowers' cane have been higher than anticipated, probably because of
excellent and well distributed rainfall and heavy fertilizer applications.
About 20% of the drainage component has been completed, and the benefits can
already be seen. Although several components are slightly behind schedule,
progress is generally satisfactory. Building works have been delayed, and the
first crushing trial of the factory is now expected to take place in December
1979/January 1980. Road construction has also been delayed, and an effective
sugar research program has yet to be established. Proposals for a training
program are now being produced, and the delay in completion of the factory
will allow more time for staff training. The standard of management of the
sugar company continues to be good, and coordination among the various agen-
cies involved in the project is improving.
Loan No. 1390T-KE/Credit No. 692-KE! - Third Agricultural Credit
Project: US$5.0 million Loan and US$20.0 million Credit of April 15,
1977; Effective Date: September 14, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
Disbursements have been delayed because of a backlog in updating
loan reimbursement requests by the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC).
The lack of consolidated information on AFC's lending trends toward different
categories of farmers and the current high arrears situation also pose pro-
blems. However, the disbursement situation is improving, and cumulative
commitments in the smallholder and medium-scale farmer categories now account
for almost all funds available for on-lending under the project. Consultants
are preparing proposals for the introduction of an improved management



- 36 -                         ANNEX II
accounting and information system. In addition, a review of AFC's salary
structure and organization is nearing completion. Both of these measures
should strengthen AFC's performance.
Loan No. 1449-KE/Credit No. 722-KE - Bura Irrigation Settlement
Project: US$34.0 million Loan and US$6.0 million Credit of June 22,
1977; Effective Date: June 27, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
Despite a slow start-up, project implementation is proceeding
satisfactorily. However, a detailed review of cost estimates indicates
that the Project will experience serious cost overruns; the revised estimate
is about 65% above the appraisal figure, and there seems to be little scope
for reduction. The Government has indicated that it will proceed with the
Project despite the significant burden on its finances. A revised financing
plan is under review by the co-financiers. No supplementary IDA financing is
proposed.
Loan No. 1636-KE - Sugar Rehabilitation Project: US$72.0 million
Loan of December 20, 1978; Effective Date: September 20, 1979;
Closing Date: March 31, 1985
Progress has been made in equipment procurement, and selection and
appointment of consultants for factory rehabilitation, road works, drainage
and irrigation is in progress. Coordination of project activities has improved
considerably, but a proposal, now under Government consideration, to withdraw
executive power from the Kenya Sugar Authority could have a negative impact on
project implementation if brought into effect.
Credit No. 858-KE - Narok Agricultural Development Project: US$13.0
million Credit of December 20, 1978; Effective Date: June 28, 1979;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1983
Early stages of implementation are proceeding satisfactorily,
although slow progress in land adjudication will limit the number of farmers
eligible for loans during the first season. Engineering consultants are being
selected for the roads component, and terms of reference for baseline studies
are under preparation.
Credit No. 914-KE - Smallholder Coffee Improvement; US$27.0 million
Credit of June 11, 1979; Closing Date: March 31, 1984
This Credit is not yet effective.
EDUCATION SECTOR
Loan No. 1184-KE - Third Education Project: US$10.0 million Loan
of December 31, 1975; Effective Date: March 17, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Physical implementation is about two years behind the appraisal
schedule, basically due to delay by the Ministry of Works in completing the



- 37 --                       ANNEX II
tender documentation for certain project institutions.  Action has been pro-
posed to alleviate the problem.  The total cost of the project has increased
by about 6% in terms of US Dollars. Implementation of educational objectives
continues to be satisfactory. The views presented in the project-financed
report of the National Committee on Educational Objectives and Policies have
been incorporated in the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan 1979-8:.  Evaluation
of the efficiency of educational broadcasting has started, as has the revision
of primary school examinations to make them more work-oriented. However,
the Government continues to be reluctant to finance technical assistance
specialists from the loan proceeds, and this may lead to delays in implementa-
tion of the project's educational objectives. The dialogue with the Government
regarding the hiring of required specialists is continuing.
Credit No. 797-KE - Fourth Education: US$23.0 million Credit of June 7,
1978; Effective Date: August 25, 1978: Closing Date: December 31, 1982
Physical implementation of the project is proceeding in line with
appraisal estimates. Implementation of the project's educational objectives
is also satisfactory. A five-year plan for revision of the Basic Education
Curricula has been prepared by the Kenya Institute of Education, and subject
review panels have started their work. The Kenya Institute of Administration
and the Faculty of Agriculture are also well on their way in the preparation
of courses and the planning of staffing and staff training. Steps are being
taken to recruit specialists needed for the Education Planning, Education
Facilities and Examinations Research and Development Units in the Ministry
of Education. Final information on the selection of the 30 Craft Training
Centers to be assisted under the project is expected shortly.
WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
Loan No. 1167-KE - Mombasa and Coastal Water Supply; US$35.0 million
Loan of October 15, 1975; Effective Date: January 13, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Project completion is now forecast about 21 months behind schedule,
and it is unlikely that lost time can be recovered. However, some major
components may well be operational by Spring 1980, several months ahead of
the overall completion date (now estimated to be 11/80). Although there is
a substantial cost overrun, this is not seen as a major problem since Govern-
ment is fully committed to earliest project completion. Regarding key per-
sonnel vacancies requiring the Ministry of Water Development's (MWD) attention,
MWD is fully aware of this situation and, while progress is slow, remedial
action is being taken.
Loan No. 1520-KE - Second Nairobi Water Supply; US$30.0 million
Loan of March 27, 1978; Effective Date: December 20, 1978; Closing
Date: December 31, 1982
Implementation started on schedule but completion is now forecast
about 18 months behind schedule due to difficulties with tender evaluations
and delays by the Borrower in contract administration and in concluding
satisfactory arrangements for construction supervision. Most supply contracts



- 38 -                         ANNEX II
financed by other donors and the construction contracts being financed by
the Bank now have been awarded. Good progress is being made on detailed
design and tendering for the remaining contracts. Bid prices to date have
been favorable, but due largely to the delays there is an estimated increase
of 50% in local currency costs and 12% in total costs. Water supply and
sewerage operations are in sound financial condition. However, the Borrower
has been slow in fulfilling financial covenants pertaining to external audits.
Loan No. 1637-KE - Rural Water Supply Project: US$20.0 million
Loan of December 20, 1978; Closing Date: July 1, 1985
This loan is scheduled to become effective January 24, 1980. New
tariffs have been introduced, and management consultants are assisting with
implementation of the first phase of the program to strengthen the organization
and management of the Ministry of Water Development (MWD). Key project staff
have been appointed except for the cost and management accountant; recruitment
efforts have identified suitable candidates and the post is expected to be
filled shortly, thereby meeting the condition of effectiveness on schedule.
Preparation for construction of schemes is about eight months behind schedule,
but MWD is planning to revise the implementation schedule to compensate for
delays.
TRANSPORT SECTOR
Loan No. 224-KE - Road Maintenance: US$12.6 million Credit of
December 28, 1970; Effective Date: March 18, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The project was substantially completed in early 1977, about a year
and a half behind schedule. The delay was primarily caused by a slow start
in construction of the regional workshops and camps due to unforeseen diffi-
culties in the location of sites, acquisition of land, and procurement of
steel. The Credit included US$2.2 million for headquarters and field staff-
ing and consultant services, but Government obtained most of these services
through bilateral arrangements. There was consequently a saving of US$1.8
million under the project, which the Government requested be used to purchase
additional workshop equipment and tools. Since this would assist in achiev-
ing the project's goals, IDA authorized using the remaining funds for this
purpose. With this revision, total project costs are expected to be as
appraised.
Loan No. 826-KE - Nairobi Airport: US$29.0 million Loan of June 2, 1972;
Effective Date: July 7, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Construction of the new Nairobi Airport was essentially completed
in December 1977, and it has been open to traffic since March 14, 1978.
The loan is 98% disbursed. The airport is performing up to expectations.

ANNEX II
Establishment of a commercial accounting system is DLow underway. The principal
problem areas are in hiring and training sufficient staff for operation and
maintenance, both of which are constrained by a Kenya-wide shortage of skilled
personnel.  A training program is being prepared by UNDP, but its execution
depends greatly _n the effectiveness of recruitment efforts.  Little progress
has been made to date, and a further postponement of the Closing Date to cover
the period of implementation of the training program and to permit completion
of disbursements for this component is under discussion. The project comple-
tion report is under preparation.
Loan No. 932-KE - Fifth Highway Project: US$29.0 million Loan of
September 6, 1973; Effective Date: November 9, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979
Implementation started 18 months behind schedule due to changes in
design standards by the Ministry of Works and financial constraints. Con-
struction of 593 km of roads has been completed, and work on the Kisiani-
Bondo road is continuing. In view of heavy cost overruns, tenders for the
construction of two roads were delayed; agreement was ultimately reached to
delete the Thuchi-Nkubu (51 km) road from the project. The Closing Date,
which was postponed from December 31, 1977 to December 31, 1979, is likely to
be postponed further to allow time for completion of the Kisii4Mogonga road
where construction has recently begun; Government's approval of postponement
of Closing Date to June 30, 1980 is awaited.
Loan No. 1133-KE - Mombasa-Nairobi Oil Product Pipeline Project:
US$20.0 million Loan of June 27, 1975; Effective Date: December 31,
1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1980
Construction was completed in October 1977 and commercial operations
commenced in January 1978 as originally planned. The final project cost
overrun is only US$9.5 million or 11%, the increase being primarily due to
escalation in construction costs. KPC's long-term financial prospects are
quite satisfactory although there could be cash flow problems in the initial
few years of operation because of the preponderance of short and medium-term
loans in the financing package. About 99% of the loan has been disbursed.
The Closing Date has been postponed to March 31, 1980 to allow time for
completion of procurement of equipment related to the operation of the pipe-
line.
Loan No. 1305-KE/Credit No. 651-KE - Rural Access Roads Project:
US$4.0 million Loan and US$4.0 million Credit of July 9, 1976; Effective
Date: October 7, 1976: Closing Date: June 30, 1981
Progress on the Rural Access Roads Program was reviewed in depth
by all donors and discussed with Government during the annual review meeting
held in June 1979. The project is about 15 months behind schedule but is now
progressing satisfactorily. All eight Bank-financed construction units are
fully equipped and are now operational. By March 31, 1979, 304 km of access
roads had been constructed, of which 16 km were gravelled. Annual output



- 40 -
ANNEX II
averages 41 km per annum for all units, about 4 km below the appraisal
estimate. Output had declined due to shortage of laborers, particularly in
Kiambu District, and poor work organization in Nakuru District. To resolve
these problems, the Ministry of Works will request local governments to supply
more labor to-construction units, and will assign a SIDA-financed engineer to
supervise works in the Nakuru area.
Loan No. 1684-KE - Highway Sector Project: US$90.0 million Loan of
April 30, 1979; Effective Date: June 18, 1979; Closing Date:
June 30, 1985
Implementation of the Government's Highway Sector Plan may be delayed
because a critical shortage of funds has caused a reduction in the highway
work program. While this has not yet affected the project appreciably, the
continuation of this trend in FY81 could touch projects included in the Sector
Loan. In general, detailed engineering has been completed for road construc-
tion and upgrading scheduled to start in FY80, and the designs for roads to
start in FY81 are completed or under preparation. The road maintenance
program for FY80 is in line with appraisal estimates except for a 30% reduction
in resealing of paved roads; however, the Ministry of Works is planning to
request funds this year from the loan to help clear the backlog of resealing.
POPULATION SECTOR
Credit No. 468-KE - Population: US$12.0 million Credit of April 1,
1974; Effective Date: July 31, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The four-year population project forms an integral part of Kenya's
Five-Year MCH/FP program, FY1975-79. All of the IDA-financed components
of the project are proceeding satisfactorily. Nearly 99% of the construction
has been completed (only two out of 36 facilities are still in the final
stages of construction), and more than 75% of the equipment and furniture has
been procured. Some delays in furnishing, equipping and staffing of facili-
ties in rural areas are occurring, but arrangements to improve the situation,
including hiring of a hospital secretary or commissioning engineer, are being
explored by the Ministry of Health. All other elements of the project have
been completed. The program components financed by other donors and the
Government are moving ahead and, with a few exceptions, are expected to be
completed as planned.

ANNEX II
POWER SECTOR
Loan No. 1147-KE - Gitaru Hydroelectric ProJect: US$59.5 million Loan 1/
of July 25, 1975; Effective Date: January 29, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979
Construction of the project was completed satisfactorily in
June 1978 on schedule and within estimated cost. On the basis of contracts
awarded for civil works and electrical and mechanical equipment, present esti-
mates show that the project cost in Kenya shillings is likely to be about 1%
lower than the appraisal estimate. Due to the devaluation of Kenyan currency
in October 1975, however, the project cost saving expressed in US dollar
equivalent will be about 15% of the appraisal estimate. This will result in a
saving in the Bank loan of about US$4.0 million, in spite of the increase made
on June 15, 1977 in the percentage of civil works expenditures to be financed
under the Bank loan from 60% to 80%. At the request of the Borrower, US$3.5
million of the loan has been cancelled. A further cancellation of US$1.9
million is expected shortly along with a postponement of the Closing Date to
allow for disbursements.
Loan No. S-12-KE - Olkaria Geothermal Engineering Project: US$9.0
million Loan of December 1, 1978; Effective Date: April 30, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
Drilling is proceeding on schedule; specifications for the new
drill rig and accessories have been completed and tenders are being evaluated.
Miscellaneous supplies and equipment have been purchased under International
Shopping procedures.
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Loan No. 946-KE - Industrial Development Bank Project: US$5.0 million
Loan of November 29, 1973: Effective Date: March 26, 1974; Closing
Date: September 30, 1979
The first Bank loan of US$5.0 million to IDB, which became effec-
tive on March 26, 1974 was fully committed in March 1978, two years behind
schedule. This delay was due to the cancellation prior to disbursement of
a number of projects previously approved. This loan has now been fully
disbursed.
1/   Net of cancellation; US$3.5 million of the original US$63.0 million Loan
was cancelled on October 19, 1978.

Loan No. 1148-KE - Second Industrial Development Bank Project:
US$10.0 million Loan of July 25, 1975; Effective Date: October 9,
1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The second Bank loan of US$10.0 million became effective on October 9,
1975. The loan was fully committed in August 1978 and US$9.7 million had been
disbursed as at December 31, 1979. The Closing Date has been postponed to
June 30, 1980.
Loan No. 1438-KE - Third Industrial Development Bank Project: US$20.0
million Loan of June 22, 1977; Effective Date: November 10, 1977;
Closing Date: July 1, 1982
This loan was declared effective on November 19, 1977. Twelve sub-
projects have been approved. As at December 31, 1979, US$12.2 million had
been committed and US$3.7 million had been disbursed.
Credit No. 750-KE - Small Scale Industry Project: US$10.0 million
Credit of November 28, 1977; Effective Date: June 26, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
Kenya Industrial Estates (KIE) continues to make progress in insti-
tutional development, particularly as regards financial discipline, project
appraisal procedures and operating performance. KIE's management is determined
to implement agreed policies to improve profitability, but continued attention
is required in a number of areas; a comprehensive plan of action for reducing
arrears is particularly important. Eight subloans totalling US$244,000 have
been committed, but no funds have been disbursed as yet under the line of
credit. A small amount has been disbursed, however, under the technical
assistance component.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Loan No. 1680-KE - First Telecommunications Project: US$20.0 million
Loan of April 11, 1979; Effective Date: August 16, 1979; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983
This loan became effective on August 16, 1979. Initial delays in
procurement of goods are likely to cause about a year's delay in project
completion.
URBAN SECTOR
Loan No. 1105-KE/Credit No. 543-KE/ - Sites and Services Project:
US$8.0 million Loan and US$8.0 million Credit of May 6, 1975; Effective
Date: September 25, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Overall project execution continues to be satisfactory but there are
mounting delays in implementation. Infrastructure has been completed for the
first 1,000 plots and most beneficiaries have constructed satisfactory houses.



- 43 -
ANNEX II
Infrastructure for an additional 2,700 plots is about 30% complete and con-
struction of infrastructure for the remaining 2,300 plots is expected to begin
soon. Cost recovery continues to be good. One primary school is now opera-
tional, but designs for the remaining schools are behind schedule and tendering
is not expected .o take place before December 1979. One health center is
under construction; however, the Bank does not plan to disburse against its
costs as its design was too expensive and was not approved by the Bank. The
design of the other health center should be submitted for approval soon.
Tenders have been invited for all other community facilities. Technical
assistance components are completed or scheduled for completion in conjunction
with the project. Project costs for the first phase remain close to appraisal
estimates but are expected to exceed original estimates for the remaining
components because of delays incurred.
Loan No. 1550-KE/Credit No. 791-KE - Second Urban Project: US$25.0
million Loan and US$25.0 million Credit of May 5, 1978; Effective Date:
October 3, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
Progress in implementation of physical components of the project is
generally satisfactory. Consultants for detailed design and engineering of
Phase I sites in all three cities (Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu) are making
good progress. Appointment of consultants for Phase II sites has now been
completed and design work is underway. The Housing Development Departments
are operational in all three cities with most key posts filled. Recruitment
of other staff is underway. Progress in meeting disbursement conditions for
the Nairobi component is slow, and progress on studies included in the project
is also slower than expected. Municipal finance reforms have been delayed
pending Cabinet approval of a paper on the subject.
WILDLIFE AND TOURISM SECTOR
Loan No. 1304T-KE - Wildlife and Tourism Project: US$17.0 million Loan
of July 9, 1976; Effective Date: November 10, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982
After initial delays, project implementation is accelerating.
Officers for the Project Management Unit have been appointed, and six key
Wildlife Planning Unit positions have been filled. The Ministry of Works has
appointed various consultants for the design and construction of all physical
project components. The draft final report of the Tourism Pricing Study has
been reviewed with Government and consultants in the field, and the final
report is expected to be submitted soon. The Very Large Herbivores Study is in
progress. Satisfactory agreements have been reached with the Amboseli ranchers
on guaranteed minimum returns, thus meeting the disbursement condition relating
to this component. The anti-poaching units are fully staffed and deployed,
and initial effectiveness of the units appears satisfactory. Draft amendments
to the Wildlife (Conservation and Management) Act: of 1976 to fulfill the
requirements of the supplementary letter giving detailed proposals for anti-
poaching operations have been approved by the Ministry of Wildlife and Tourism
and are now in the final stages of processing.

East African Community
There are currently five projects in execution in the East African
Community. 1/
Loan No. 638-EA - Second Harbours Project: US$35.0 million Loan
of August 25, 1969; Date of Effectiveness: December 16,_1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Loan No. 865-EA - Third Harbours Project: US$26.5 million Loan of
December 18, 1972; Date of Effectiveness: April 16, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Second Harbours project included financing for five general
cargo berths and a single buoy tanker terminal for the Port of Dar es Salaam;
two general cargo berths and a bulk cement wharf for Mombasa; tugs, lighters,
cargo handling equipment, offices, housing and general improvements for both
ports. The Third Harbours project included three new deep water berths,
modernization of two berths and a lighterage quay, a training school building
and central repair area for Dar es Salaam; modernization of several berths and
a lighterage quay, construction of a tug berth, cold storage facilities and a
training building in Mombasa and improvement of a lighterage quay in Tanga.
Construction of all major project elements has been completed and a joint
project completion report was issued in January 1979. -Because of shortage
of funds under both loans, the following minor project elements have not
been submitted for Bank financing: the second phase of modernization of the
lighterage quay and a training school for Dar es Salaam; and modernization
of the lighterage quay and a training school for Mombasa. Locally financed
contracts have been awarded for these project elements with the exception of
the modernization of the lighterage quay in Mombasa. General cargo throughput
has increased above appraisal forecasts for Dar es Salaam, and cargo handling
productivity has generally improved with increasing throughput; however, port
labor productivity has stagnated in Mombasa where general cargo throughput has
declined considerably. Legislation to establish a Tanzania Harbours Authority
and a Kenya Ports Authority has been enacted. Management of ports in both
countries is competent. Some US$34.5 million of Loan 638-EA and US$25.6
million of Loan 865-EA has already been disbursed. The agreed allocation of
undisbursed funds at October 1, 1977 between the countries concerned is given
below:
1/   Since October 1, 1977, the East African Community loans (excluding the
East African Development Bank) have been disbursed on the basis of
separate national guarantees. The agreed allocation of undisbursed
balances for each loan, as proposed in a report to the Executive
Directors dated December 29, 1977 (R77-312) and approved on January 12,
1978, is given in this Annex. The Closing Dates for Loans 638-EA,
674-EA and 865-EA have passed. However, since the amount allocated
to and guaranteed by each Partner State is clearly identified under
the terms of the agreement signed on January 25, 1978, as proposed
in the above report (R77-312), we are continuing disbursements.

Loan No. 674-EA - Third Railways Project: US$42.4 million Loan
of May 25, 1970; Date of Effectiveness: October 30, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The original purpose of the project was to complete the Railways'
1969-1972 Development Program, including track improvement, procurement of
rolling stock and other equipment, and to finance studies of the economic
feasibility of certain railway lines and services. The physical execution
of the original project has been seriously delayed due to administrative and
political problems within the Community. In Novetmber 1974, the Executive
Directors approved a reallocation of the uncommitted balance of the Loan to be
used for consultant services and emergency investments in track material. All
three countries have now enacted legislation to establish their own Railways
Corporations. The agreed allocation of undisbursed funds at October 1, 1977
among the countries concerned is given below:
(US$ million)
Kenya               2.0
Tanzania            3.8
Uganda              1.9

Loan No. 914-EA - Third Telecommunications Project: US$32.5 million
Loan of June 22, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: September 19, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The project included provision for procurement of local telephone
exchange equipment, cables and subscriber apparatus, microwave and UHF/VHF
systems and multiplex equipment, interurban cables and wires, automatic
switching and signalling equipment, telegraph, telex and data equipment,
and training. All project items, except the microwave radio system, have
been completed; this system is likely to be completed by mid-1980. The
slippage in the project's completion was due to initial delays in procurement
caused by staffing and other problems associated with the relocation of
headquarters. About US$30.8 million of the loan has now been disbursed. The
agreed allocation of undisbursed funds as at October 1, 1977 among the coun-
tries concerned is as follows:
(US$ million)
Kenya                2.4
Tanzania             3.5
Uganda               0.1
Total                6.0
Loan No. 1204-EA - East African Development Bank: US$15.0 million
Loan of March 1, 1976; Date of Effectiveness:  June 7, 1976;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980
The environment within the Community has continued to have a
negative impact on EADB operations. Level of operations both for appraisal
and supervision has been depressed, but there has been some improvement in
the state of the portfolio with the arrears affected portfolio falling from
50% as of June 30, 1977 to 43% as of March 31, 1978. Some US$9.1 million of
the loan has been disbursed to date, and the uncommitted balance amounts to
US$3.0 million.

LETTER OF INTENT
Mr. Robert S. McNamara,
President,
International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development,
1818 H. Street, N.W.,
WASHINGTON, D. C. 20433,
-U.S.A.
Dear Mr. McNamara,
1.    In March of 1979 Kenya issued its Fourth Development Plan,
covering the period 1979-1983. The focus of this new Plan is on
the alleviation of poverty in urban, and especially in rural, areas
through continued economic growth and greater employment
generation. The Plan also calls for expansion of government services
aimed at meeting the basic needs of the populace. The Plan recognizes,
however, that this must also be a period of better utilization of
capacity, when more efficient use is made of the investment, both
public and private, that has been carried out during our nation's
first three development plan periods. Moreover, the Plan recognizes
that the time has come to begin the -difficult task of making the
industrial sector more efficient and competitive and to encourage a
shift in the pattern of industrialization toward a more resource based
and export-oriented strategy.
2.    Unfortunately, achievement of the goals of the Fourth Development
Plan has been jeopardized bv a severe deterioratton in the country's
international terms of trade caused by a precipitous drop in coffee
prices and by an equally sharp increase in the price of imported
petroleum, upon which we are heavily dependent. Moreover, the task
of the Government has been further complicated by the need to make
extraordinary expenditures for national security as a result of external
factors. The traditional policy of the Government has been to spend
one of the lowest proportions of its national resources on defence when
compared with other nations of the World.

Mr. McNamara
3.    The Government intends, nevertheless, to carry out the
important structural reforms and social policies incorporated in the
Plan. This letter indicates the types of adjustments that have been
required and will be made to ensure financial stability and international
creditworthiness and to reiterate and put a time frame on our plans
to reorient industrial strategy.
A. Measures to  Ensure  Creditworthiness
4.    Monetary and Fiscal Management - The Government's programme
includes an increase in taxes, restructuring of the 1979/80 budget and
ceilings on government and total borrowing from banking system. The
major components of this programme have been incorporated into a
Stand-by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund which will
cover the period from July, 1979 through March, 1981.  The agreement
also provides that Kenya will undertake an intensive study of developments
in exchange rate regimes and reach an agreement with the I. M. F. on an
exchange rate policy.
5.    Revision of the Public Investment Programme - The Government
has, in addition, undertaken a major revision of the Forward Budget
which will provide the framework for public outlays during the remaining
three fiscal years of the Plan period (FY 1980/81 - FY 1982/83).  The
expenditure guidelines issued to the ministries and their individual budget
ceilings take into account the slowing down of the overall rate of growth
of the economy and of the planned rate of expansion of government
activities.  The macroeconomic and balance of payments parameters used
for the projection of revenue and expenditures have been discussed with
the Bank staff.  Individual ministry ceilings and allocation of expenditures
between "development" and "recurrent" categories have, in general,
followed those set forth in the Development Plan. The ministries have
been informed of these allocations.
6.    In submitting their expenditure proposals the ministries have been
instructed to:
(a) give priority to promotion of exports, to increasing
domestic production of agricultural commodities and
use more labour-intensive techniques,
(b) reduce the rate of growth of administrative services
and social services and infrastructure, concentrating
instead on projects and programmes which promise
more immediate returns in added production and
employment,
and

Mr. McNamara
(c) review programme and projects in the Development
Plan both in relation to new information on costs
and benefits and in relation to revised economic
guidelines.
7.    Submissions from Ministries will be reviewed by working groups
of the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Planning and Economic
Development. These groups will authorize inclusion and/or modification
of all projects or progammres in the Budget. They will, inter alia,
(a) ensure that sufficient funds are available for
completion of approved ongoing projects and for
operation and maintenance of completed investments;
(b) approve all projects for discussion with external
aid agencies;
and
(c) ensure that the thrust of the Government's objective
of improving rural incomes and employment opportunities
is maintained.
8.    External Borrowing and Debt Management - Because of the
suddenness of the deterioration of the country'7external terms of trade
and uncertainties surrounding the availability of rapidly-disbursing
external assistance on concessional terms, the Government found it
necessary to bolster its international liquidity by arranging U.S. $200
million in Eurocredit financing.
9.    Because of the onerous terms of such commercial borrowing the
Government intends to minimize recourse to this market. However,
given the country's balance of payments outlook for the Plan period, it
is clear that such borrowing cannot be dispensed with entirely. The
Government shall, beginning with its fiscal year 1980/81, establish
annual programs for new public and publicly guaranteed debt which will
set realistic limits for new borrowings by various categories of maturities
with the objective of maintaining prudent levels of debt service obligations.
It is not the intention of the Government to use external commercial
borrowing for budgetary support throughout fiscal year 1980/81 over and
above the $200 million which has already been negotiated, nor does the
Government intend to enter into any new commitments for the provision
of foreign exchange until July 1980.

Mr. McNamara
10.   In order to ensure that this policy objective is adhered to,
the Government intends to improve its approval process and its system
of recording of external debt as follows:-
(a) a comprehensive survey of all debt outstanding of
government corporations, statutory boards and other
public enterprises is already under way in order to
establish the exact amount of public and publicly
guaranteed debt obligations;
(b) the Government will strengthen the machinery for
processing of external borrowing which will include
continued consultations between the Treasury, Ministry
of Planning and Economic Development and the Central
Bank of Kenya.  Towards this end the office of the
Treasury charged with recording all public and publicly
guaranteed debt will be strengthened with additional
staff during the current fiscal year. The World Bank
will be requested to supply short-term technical
assistance for improving the unit's operations;
(c) the Central Bank will prepare balance of payments
estimates and an annual foreign exchange budget.  In
addition, it will have the responsibility for monitoring
private foreign debt. For this purpose it will maintain
a register of all private corporation and individual
external debt in excess of K. Shs. 1 million and of greater
than one year maturity.  However, this will require
significant strengthening of its staff which will be under-
taken as soon as practicable.
B. Reorienting Industrial Development Strategy
11.   Rationalization of Protection - The Fourth Development Plan
calls for effecting a "transition from an industrial sector primarily
serving the domestic market to one that is actively and competitively
engaged in export sales". In order to induce greater industrial
efficiency the Plan states that ".... reliance on various forms of quantitative
restrictions (on imports) will be phased out and tariffs will become
the major form of protection ". We consider that the shift away from
such restrictions will be the first step leading to a more uniform,
rational and moderate system of tariff protection. In this connection,
the following measures have been or will be taken as part of implementing
the first phase of the process:-

Mr. -McNamara
(a) Although it has been ascertained that no new firms are
being given the privilege of Letters of No Objection the
Government has issued further instructions that no new
investment agreements should include provisions for
Letters of No Objection privilege.
(b) The Government has issued instructions that no new
Letters of No Objection should be issued administratively.
(c) The Government will examine in detail provisions of all
existing investment agreements, covering Letters of No
Objection privilege and issue guidelines as to how best
these should be phased out as soon as possible, depending
on the extent to which the agreements are legally binding.
(d) At the appropriate time the Government will issue guide-
lines to the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Industry
and the Central Bank of Kenya on the phasing out of other
quantitative restrictions.
12.   The second phase of the process will involve standardizing and
reducing the level of protection. In order to ensure minimum disruption
and dislocations for the economy in general and for individual firms,
this will require a series of studies to:-
(a) determine the appropriate general level of incentives to
be provided and the role of various fiscal and monetary
instruments in this respect.
(b) design necessary complementary programmes such as
export compensation, financing and insurance and fiscal
incentives for industrial investment;
(c) prepare recommendations for the phasing in of the new
protective regime,
and
(d) ascertain the effects on industry subgroups and individual
firms and recommend measures to assist them in the
adjustment or transitional period.

13.   In order to facilitate this complex task, the Government has
obtained UNDP financing of a study to provide the technical background
for these changes and to make recommendations for implementing the
acceptable proposals. Work on the study has already started and a
Bank staff member seconded to the Government to help carry out the
required studies has taken up duties on September lst, 1979.
14.   We envision the following schedule for carrying out the studies
and implementing the reform. Given the complexity of the task, however,
it may not be possible to complete all steps on schedule. However, we will
keep in contact with the Bank and. review progress periodically.
Activity                                Timing
a.  Examine provisions of all existing        September 1979 - April 1980
investment agreements covering
letters of No Objection privilege,
determine tariff level equivalent of
these and other quantitative trade
restrictions, and recommend time
schedule for phasing out quantitative
restrictions and replacement with
tariffs.
b.  Begin replacement of restrictions         June - July 1980
with tariffs in accordance with time
schedule based on the study referred
to in (a).
c. Review of existing levels of effective     September 1979 - September
protection and cost structure of          1980
firms and preparation of
recommendations for new protective
system.
d.  Preparation of recommendations to         September 198Q - December
alleviate short term adjustment           1980
impact and new export compensation
scheme.
e.  Internal Government consideration of      January 1980 - March 1981
policy package and consultations with
ind ustry.
f.  First round of tariff adjustments.        April - May 1981

15.   Export Promotion - The Government recognizes that in order
to sustain acceptable rates of GDP growth, exports must be accelerated.
It therefore intends to ensure that there are sufficient incentives for
domestic production of exportables and that their prices are competitive
in world markets.
16.   Kenya's present system of export subsidies has proven to be
administratively difficult and has not entirely achieved the objective for
which it was established. Pending the outcome of the study mentioned
in para 14 (a) the Government -intends to make the existing system
within the next year administratively simpler and ensure that it provides
greater certainty to exporters. The necessary consultations are being
conducted with relevant institutions involved in the processing of
documents for export compensation to determine how best existing
bottlenecks can be removed so as to speed up payments. Measures to
implement this will be introduced during the fiscal year 1980/81.
17.   A study by Kenya External Trade Authority for the formation of
an Export Insurance and Financing Scheme is near completion. The
Government will examine the proposals andl decide on an appropriate line
of action early next year. In order to facilitate review of this proposal
and implementation of an appropriate programme the Government intends
to obtain expert advice by March, 1980 and it is expected that an export
insurance and financing system will be introduced by September, 1980.
18.   Government Role in Private Investment - Projects submitted to
Government by entrepreneurs to obtain approved enterprise status will be
subject to a thorough review of technical, financial and economic viability
by the New Projects Committee prior to any decision with Government on
incentives, financial assistance or special treatment with regard to foreign
exchange transactions.  Standardized guidelines have already been issued
for this purpose. Government financial intermediaries dealing with
industrial enterprises will be required to apply similar criteria in project
analysis.

Mr. McNamara
19.   A report prepared for the Government has indicated that the
growth of the parastatal sector, which includes government and
government owned investment development and regulatory corporations
and Boards as well as companies and corporate entities in which the
government is a main shareholder (or their subsidiaries), has not
always been accompanied by development of management systems to
ensure that the sector plays its role in an efficient manner.  The
Government has, therefore, taken the following actions:-
(a) a division on parastatals has been established in the
Ministry of Finance,, to monitor activities of this
sector;
(b) new guidelines will be issued for government and
parastatal investment;
and
(c) a budgetary decision has been made to slow down the
pace of direct participation in private enterprises and,
instead, channel funds through existing banks and
development finance companies.
20.   Interest Rate Policy - The Government recognizes that the
structure of interest rates can play an important role in the development
process by encouraging financial savings and providing adequate returns
for financial intermediaries.
21.   The Government has, therefore, agreed to undertake a review
of the level and structure of interest rates in the country.  The terms
of reference of the review have been reviewed by the Bank staff.  We
expect that the review and discussion with Bank staff will be completed
by the end of April, 1980.

Mr. McNamara
22.   Conclusion -  The above should not be taken as a complete
summary of the objectives and policies stated in Kenya's Fourth
Development Plan. These have been described in greater detail
and analysed effectively in the Economic Memorandum prepared by
the staff of the Bank and distributed to the Executive Directors in
March, 1979. The Government remains fully committed to the
objectives of that Plan and intends to carry out to the fullest extent
possible, limited only by its technical capacities and available
resources.  In all these respects, we hope that we can count on
-the continued support of the International community through project
loans and through additional programme assistance. In particular
it is our hope that additional resources will be made available by
the World Bank through further programme assistance during the
Plan Period 1979 - 1983.  In this context we realize that due to the
changed economic conditions substantial revisions and adjustments
will need to be made to the strategies outlined in the Plan.  Work
on such revision is expected to commence in the immediate future.
Yours sincerely,
MWAI KIBAKI
VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FINANCE
