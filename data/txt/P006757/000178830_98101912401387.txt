1. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Colombia's main indigenous commercial energy resources are hydro-
power, coal, gas and oil. Potential hydropower appears to be the most promis-
ing at some 100 GW of capacity and 250,000 or more GWh of annual energy
capability. Colombia is also endowed with very large coal and gas deposits.
Crude oil output has declined since 1971 at an average rate of 7.5%/a.
Over the same period, consumption has increased by 7%/a. As a result, Colombia
is now a net importer of crude oil (it was a net exporter until 1976), and
prospects are for these imports to rise sharply to onerous levels by the early
1980s unless additional reserves are discovered and developed quickly.
Measures are being taken to deal with this problem and to develop alternative
energy sources. In the case of coal, there have been various obstacles to
more utilization of the existing potential: prices as low as one-fifth of
those prevailing on international markets, the competition of low-priced
petroleum, fragmentation of production among a large number of very small
mines with low output and productivity levels, and lack of efficient marketing
and transport infrastructure. However, the Government is currently taking
action to address these problems, and large-scale development of coal reserves
is planned. With respect to natural gas, a previous decline in known reserves
and output has been dramatically reversed with the discovery of large deposits
in the Atlantic Coast region.
1.02      Production of primary energy during 1965-75 has not kept pace with
overall economic expansion. It increased only 1.7%/a during 1965-70 when
it reached its peak at 657 trillion Btu, and declined since then to 625
trillion Btu in 1975, mainly due to falling crude oil output. In contrast to
the declining energy production, domestic consumption grew by 5.4%/a during
1965-70, and 8.5%/a during 1971-73, when economic growth was high and energy
prices declined sharply in real terms. During 1974-76, the economic down-turn
and increase in real energy prices had a dampening effect on consumption,
which now has settled at a growth of about 4.5%/a compared with a GDP growth
of some 6% in recent years.
1.03      The Government's development strategy is aimed at achieving a more
favorable balance between domestic energy supply and use, thus utilizing
more fully those energy sources which are in abundant supply, i.e., hydropower,
natural gas and coal. The Government is planning a large-scale development
of coal deposits by state entities in association with foreign investors. In
order to expand potentially viable mines, a well-coordinated Government program
is needed to provide a more rational price structure and to improve mine
safety, credit facilities and support for marketing and infrastructure. Such
a program would need substantial technical and capital assistance from abroad.
1.04      In the petroleum sector, the Government has taken action to stimulate
investment in exploration and field development, which had declined after 1971
because of unrealistically low prices applied in domestic sales. The Government
is encouraging foreign participation in exploration and development on the
basis of association contracts with ECOPETROL (the Government oil agency).



- 2 -
The prices paid for oil produced by increasing yields from existing fields and
from new fields have been raised, the latter now being close to world market
levels, and the discriminatory exchange rate for petroleum has been eliminated.
As a result, interest among foreign petroleum companies to expand or start
operations in Colombia has been intensified and there has been a significant
upturn in exploration.
1.05       Plans are underway to explore the country's uranium potential and
the Government has concluded an exploration contract with the French Minatome
group. The development of any uranium potential that might exist would
provide the country with another long-term energy option.
Sector Organization
1.06       Electricity is the fastest growing form of energy use in Colombia;
its share in overall energy consumption has grown from 14% in 1960 to 24% in
1975. This process has been assisted by the gradual consolidation of isolated
facilities into regional systems and the interconnection of these systems
to facilitate development of Colombia's low-cost hydro resources. The main
systems are the Central System, covering the interior and the Pacific coast,
and the Atlantic (or Northern) System covering the northern part of the
country. The proposed Mesitas Hydro Project, and the San Carlos Hydro Project
for which the Bank approved a loan of US$126 million on May 30, 1978, will be
located in the Central System. The 500-kV Interconnection Project for which
the Bank approved a loan of US$50 million also on May 30, 1978, will intercon-
nect the Central and Atlantic systems.
1.07       Public electricity service is presently provided by:
(a) municipally-owned companies, independent of the Central
Government, of which the largest are Empresa de Energia
Electrica de Bogota (EEEB - the proposed borrower for the
Mesitas Project), Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM), and
Empresas Municipales de Cali (EMCALI);
(b) national enterprises such as Instituto Colombiano de Energia
Electrica (ICEL), the Corporacion Autonoma Regional del
Cauca (CVC), and the Corporacion Electrica de la Costa
Atlantica (CORELCA);
(c) a large number of local subsidiaries of ICEL, CORELCA and
CVC 1/; and
(d) a generating and transmission company, Interconexion
Electrica S.A. (ISA), whose shareholders are EEEB, EPM,
and the three nationally owned companies ICEL, CVC and
CORELCA, which together own 50% of ISA's shares.
1/   In most cases the ownership of these subsidiaries is shared with local
governments.



- 3 -
Colombia has a number of public entities known as Regional Autonomous
Corporations, of which CVC is the largest, with a range of functions related
to development of the regions under their jurisdiction, including legal
capacity to generate, transmit and distribute electricity. The Ministry of
Mines and Energy owns a part of the sector directly through ICEL and CORELCA.
EEEB and EPM (presently the largest power utilities) are controlled by auton-
omous municipal governments. CVC reports to the National Planning Department
(NPD) as do other regional development corporations, which may, as already
noted, undertake power projects.
Planning and Regulation
1.08      Through its Electric Energy Division, the Ministry of Mines and
Energy is charged with formulating a national policy for the generation,
transomission and distribution of electricity. This division, which is being
organized, was also given the responsibility for coordinating and supervising
power sector planning. In defining investment priorities, the Ministry of
Mines and Energy shares responsibility with the NPD. It does not have the
powers assigned to similar agencies in other countries (issuance of licenses,
regulation of tariffs, approval of expansion programs) to enforce its policies
and program. Public utility retail tariffs (including those for electricity)
are regulated by the Junta Nacional de Tarifas de Servicios Publicos in the
NPD, which has customarily approved requests for rate increases. However,
utilities are free to set tariffs at levels lower than those approved by the
Junta and have done so in the past. Although the Government cannot enforce
its policies directly on the municipally controlled power companies, a
mechanism for reaching agreement on major issues affecting the sector is
provided by ISA, in which the Government has a major if not controlling
interest.
1.09      ISA was established to provide a rational framework for sector
expansion by interconnecting the systems of its shareholders, thus creating
a national grid capable of sustaining large hydroelectric developments. By
pooling financial resources through ISA, its shareholders have been able
to undertake much larger and more economical projects than would have been
feasible under the previous arrangements. However, ISA is still in the
process of growing into a strong national utility. The municipal utilities
were reluctant to reduce their independent roles in generation expansion and
experienced severe financial constraints which reduced the availability of
funds to ISA. Decisions on system expansion required protracted negotiations
among the shareholders and the Government, further complicated by the original
shareholders' reluctance to allow the incorporation of CORELCA into ISA.
Throughout these negotiations, the Bank continued to support the concept of
centralized planning, execution and operation of the national grid and resisted
proposals that would weaken ISA. Because of the time required by the share-
holders to arrive at decisions on these fundamental issues, Bank consideration
of the San Carlos I and 500-kV Interconnection Projects suffered considerable
delays. The start of the appraisal of the Mesitas Project was held up until
December 1977 until the critical points at issue had been resolved.



1.10      The solutions included agreements to adequate shareholder participa-
tion in ISA by CORELCA, to programs of substantial increases in tariffs which
are being implemented, to adequate programs of investment contributions to ISA
by its shareholders, and to amendments to various provisions in ISA's bylaws
which should help strengthen ISA's financial position. In addition, revisions
have been introduced into ISA's bylaws which specify that ISA would define the
future generation expansion program in the interconnected system. ISA would
own plants requiring the joint effort of all its shareholders. Plants of
regional interest may be built by one or several shareholders, subject to ISA
approval of such regional plants. Under this arrangement, ISA would, in
effect, be responsible for an important part of sector regulation and planning.
Only utilities which do not participate directly in ISA and the regional
development corporations other than CVC, together currently accounting for
less than 5% of the country's total electric energy market (not including
industrial self-producers), would not be covered by its decisions. Voting
arrangements in ISA have been restructured to require the concurrence of four
of its five major shareholders in all important decisions, thus protecting the
interests of the municipal utilities and encouraging a more positive partici-
pation in its deliberations.
World Bank Participation in the Sector
1.11      Since 1950, the Bank has made 20 loans to Colombia's power sector,
totalling US$526 million (see Attachment 1.1) including the two loans approved
on May 30, 1978. Sixteen loans have assisted the expansion of capacity in the
systems of Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Cartagena, Bucaramanga, and Manizales.
In addition, the Bank is currently supporting rural electrification under the
Integrated Rural Development Project (1352-CO, 1977). The Bank's Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) undertook a detailed review in 1971-72 of Bank
lending in Colombia's power sector. 1/ OED concluded that the Bank's financing
had been successful in assisting the power companies to develop hydroelectric
plants at lower unit cost than they otherwise would have been able to do.
This permitted greater urban coverage as well as cheaper and more reliable
electricity supply to industry. OED also commended Bank efforts in the
establishment of the central interconnected system which facilitated further
power sector development. In addition, OED identified as important consider-
ations for possible future loans in the Colombian power sector: the need to
give greater attention to power distribution; the need for improvement of
financial recording and financial planning capabilities; and the need to give
more attention to public utility tariff structures. The first and third of
these three points are addressed under the San Carlos loan (paragraphs 1.20
and 1.24). The proposed Mesitas loan addresses the second and third points
(paragraphs 2.07 and 5.10).
1/   "Operations Evaluation Report:  Electric Power" (Report No. Z-17, dated
March 10, 1972) and "Bank Operations in Colombia - An Evaluation" (Report
No. Z-18, dated May 25, 1972).



-D-
Power Market and Supply
1.12      Electricity generation in Colombia expanded by an average of 9.7%/a
over the period 1960-70. The rate of expansion then decreased to about 8.6%
on average until the end of 1976 due to the slackening in industrial growth
after 1974 (growth in industrial consumption decreased to 7.4%/a compared with
9.5%/a during cne sixties). Present per capita electricity generation is
estimated at 600 kWh, which is below the average for Latin America. Installed
capacity at the end of 1976 was 3,300 MW, including that of self-producers.
Hydro stations accounted for 68% of total energy generation.
1.13      Colombia has about 1.84 million electricity subscribers in an esti-
mated total population of 24.2 million; 87% of these subscribers are residen-
tial, and electricity service reaches 60% of the population. Studies by
the Bank's Development Policy Staff indicate that Colombia has been able
to provide electricity service to approximately 85% of its urban population.
However, only 16% of rural families had service in 1974. Of the electrified
municipalities, 88% have continuous service, while the other 12% have service
only during certain hours of the day; also, in many towns the quality of the
service is unsatisfactory because of inadequate maintenance.
1.14      Residential consumers accounted for the largest share of electricity
sales by the major utilities in 1976, followed by industrial consumers:
Sales                  Subscribers
GWh       %              No.         _ %
Residential                     4,384     41.6         1,590,000       86.5
Industrial                     3,656      34.7            26,002        1.4
Commercial                      1,385     13.1           202,295       11.0
Others                          1,397     10.6            20,075        1.1
Total               10,542    100.0         1,838,372      100.0
1.15     Public utilities accounted for 93% of total electricity supply; the
rest was provided by self-suppliers. EEEB generated 26% of the total supply,
EPM 25% and CVC, ICEL and CORELCA about 13% each. Self-suppliers (mainly oil
refineries, petro-chemical plants, steel mills and cement works) owned 5.8% of
the country's installed capacity; these plants are also connected to the
public electricity service. The public-service labor force totalled 13,358 at
the end of 1976, including 6,663 manual workers; this gives ratios of 233
kW/employee and 138 subscribers/employee, which compare favorably with the
average for Latin America.
Rural Electrification
1.16      Most of the country's rural villages with electricity service are
close to urban centers. In 1974 only 16% of the small town and isolated rural
households had electricity service (paragraph 1.13). It is estimated that the
cost of a rural electrification network for the country as a wnole would be



- 6 -
about US$500 per household, and that over a period of six years electricity
could be brought to about 20% of the rural population presently without
service (about 40,000 dwellings a year) at a cost of some US$120 million.
1.17      Rural electrification programs are currently under way in a number
of regions in the country. Among the most important are (a) the electrifica-
tion subproject of the 1977-79 Integrated Rural Development Program supported
by IDB, Canadian International Development Agency, and Bank financing
(Loan 1352-CO); (b) the electrification program in the department of Choco
financed by the Netherlands Government; and (c) the electrification program
in the coffee-growing areas, financed by coffee sector resources.
Sector Investment Program and Studies
1.18      Investment in generation and transmission facilities during 1977-84
is expected to amount to about Col$250 billion in current prices (about US$5
billion in 1976 prices), some 60% of which would be in foreign exchange. The
investments in distribution are only partly known (for EEEB and EPM amount-
ing to some Col$22 billion) because details are not available for the subsi-
diaries of CVC, CORELCA, ICEL and the smaller entities. A master plan for
power development to be prepared by ISA and its shareholders by December 31,
1979 would provide such information (paragraph 1.20).
1.19      The program of investments in generation and transmission includes,
in addition to the projects already decided upon by the Government and ISA's
shareholders, the start of construction of projects that will form part
of the 1984-90 expansion program. ISA has submitted to the Bank a study 1/
indicating that the 1984-88 portion of this program would be the least-cost
alternative for system expansion. The study was undertaken by ISA in view of
the delays encountered in the execution of a more comprehensive study (1.25)
which the Government decided to carry out when the Bank made its loan for the
Guatape II project in 1973 (874-CO). ISA is cooperating in the comprehensive
survey of hydro resources included in the study, and a long-term expansion
program based on the survey's findings is expected to be available in mid-1979.
The Government agreed under the San Carlos Loan to present this portion of the
study to the Bank for review not later than September 30, 1979.
1.20      In order to improve the allocation of resources between the various
categories of investment which the power sector will have to carry out, ISA
arid its shareholders agreed under the San Carlos loan to prepare and present
to the Government and the Bank for comments by December 31, 1979, a Power
Sector Development Master Plan. This plan would cover the period 1980-90 in
detail and 1991-2000 in general terms, and would consolidate the programs for
generation and transmission. Similarly, ISA's shareholders have agreed to
prepare and present under coordination of the Ministry of Mines and Energy,
to the Government and the Bank for comments by December 31, 1979, a Sector
Development Master Plan for Distribution for the period 1980-2000. This plan

(ISA, Junio 1977).



- 7 -
would consolidate, as part of ISA's Master Plan, all existing and future
programs for distribution; it would cover the period 1980-85 in detail. The
Master Plan would provide a valuable framework for long-range decisions on
sector financing, pricing and rural electrification which are presently being
based on partial and uncoordinated information.
1.21      To ensure that only sound projects are undertaken, assuiances were
obtained in connection with the San Carlos loan that ISA and its shareholders
would not undertake construction of any generating plant or combination of
plants of more than 200 MW (ISA) and 100 MW (shareholders) capacity prior to
completion of the San Carlos I Project unless satisfactory evidence has been
presented to the Bank that it is economically justified as part of ISA's
national power expansion program and that adequate financing is available to
carry it out without negatively affecting such company's financial condition
or its obligations under the San Carlos I Project.
Finances and Tariffs
1.22      Except for EEEB and EPM, which have histories of adequate cash
generation, the power sector has relied heavily on borrowings and budgetary
contributions to finance its investments. EEEB and EPM operate low-cost
systems and cover the most affluent markets in the country; they have, there-
fore, been able to finance their investments with an appropriate balance of
borrowings and cash generation while charging relatively low rates. Because
there has been no mechanism to obtain financial transfers within the sector
from the more affluent areas to the less affluent, CVC, ICEL and CORELCA,
which operate high-cost systems, have had to rely on budgetary contributions
from the Government and subsidies, despite their higher rates.
1.23      Rate adjustments lagged considerably behind yearly inflation over
most of the period 1971-76, during which average rates increased by about
13%/a while inflation averaged 19%. The 1976 average revenue - at prices of
1970 - was equivalent to only Col$0.147/kWh (73% of the 1970 average revenue
of Col$0.202/kWh). The positive trend in rate setting which began in 1975, is
expected to continue with gradual increases in real terms. In view of the
importance to economic growth of adequate electricity service, the Government
has adopted a policy calling for adequate rates in order to ensure that the
sector generates internally a reasonable portion of the funds required. As
may be seen in Chapter 5, EEEB's own rate policy is consistent with this.
1.24      Although EEEB's current tariff program should bring Bogota's average
tariff up to a satisfactory level during the next two years, this in itself
would not redress the serious imbalance within the tariff structure. 1/ The
greatest imbalance results from the low level of residential rates in relation
to industrial and commercial charges (paragraph 5.08), which is typical of the
pattern throughout Colombia and not just in Bogota. The present tariff struc-
ture, by concentrating the burden of meeting system revenue requirements
1/   OED Report No. Z-17, pages 59-63 (paragraph 1.11) contains an analysis of
tariff structure problems in Bogota.



- 8 -
on industrial consumers, could encourage EEEB's residential customers to
consume more electricity in the long run than they would if charged the full
cost of service, which in turn could lead to inefficient allocation of national
resources. To address the problem, ISA's shareholders have agreed under the
San Carlos loan to carry out, coordinated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy,
a study of the cost of service to final consumers and its implications for
power pricing, in the following major markets: Bogota, Medellin,
Cali and Barranquilla, under conditions and terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank. The study, which also includes the area covered by the rural
electrification component of Loan 1352-CO, would be completed not later than
December 31, 1978, and its recommendations together with the views of the
Ministry would be discussed with the Bank not later than June 30, 1979. EEEB
has agreed to establish a program of tariff structure revisions as a result of
this process (paragraph 5.10), and it is expected that in due course the other
shareholders will do so as well.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.25     - In the past, the large number of entities associated with the power
sector, the lack of adequate regulation, coordination and planning at the
national level, and low electricity rates have contributed to the less than
satisfactory performance of the sector in making rational use of Colombia's
abundant hydroelectric resources. Because of the regionalized nature of the
sector, reflecting the political and economic decentralization of Colombia,
there were difficulties in coordinating investment allocation and insufficient
technical cooperation; decisions were made on a local basis without due regard
to overall country planning for power development. The lags in resolving these
problems resulted in uneconomic use of fuel by companies unable to share in
receiving lower cost energy potentially available from hydro sources elsewhere
in the country, and caused recurring power shortages despite the large expan-
sions in capacity which were taking place. The occurrence of temporary
shortages is expected to persist into the early eighties, and will be solved
only provided the agreed development program is implemented expeditiously (the
latter in turn now being largely dependent on adequate rate setting). In an
effort to address the sector problems, the Government indicated in 1973, when
the Bank made its loan for the Guatape II Project, that it planned to carry
out with the assistance of consultants a study of the sector covering its
institutional and financial problems and its long-term expansion program. The
study, for which assistance was obtained from the Federal Republic of Germany,
is being executed by two groups of German consultants. The first of these,
working with NPD, concentrated on sector institutions and financing.  The
Government agreed under the San Carlos loan agreement to present this report
to the Bank by November 30, 1978. The second group of consultants is working
with ISA on a hydro survey and long-term expansion plan, which the Government
agreed to present to the Bank by September 30, 1979.
1.26      The Government has taken a number of positive measures to address
the sector's institutional constraints. In 1975 it eliminated the jurisdic-
tional overlap between ICEL and CORELCA on the Atlantic Coast by transferring
control over the electricity distribution companies in that region to CORELCA.
Another positive measure was the reorientation of ICEL, which in future will
be responsible basically for electricity development in rural and semi-rural



- 9 -
areas, where the Government will continue to subsidize the service since it
cannot be financially self-supporting in those areas. 1/ In order to remedy
the problems that exist between the generating and distributing companies in
the Cauca Valley as a consequence of the complex organization of electricity
service in that region, the Government has supported the establishment of a
regional power company whose basic function will be to consolidate that
region's electricity sector in a single enterprise. With the incorporation of
CORELCA into ISA, most of the sector is represented directly or indirectly 1/
in ISA's Board, and a better coordination of power sector planning in Colombia
will now be possible. ISA's effectiveness in achieving this coordination,
however, will depend on its ability to sustain the consensus developed over
the past two years among its shareholders.
1/   The sector's organization has to date precluded the usual practice of
deriving resources from well-developed urban markets to support service
in rural areas (paragraph 1.22).

2. THE BORROWER
General Description
2.01      The proposed borrower for the Mesitas Project, Empresa de Energia
Electrica de Bogota (EEEB), is an autonomous company owned by the Municipality
of the Special District of Bogota. It was established by private Colombian
interests and has operated the city's electric service for the past 77 years,
since 1951 under municipal ownership. It has an installed capacity of 689
MW, 553 MW of which is hydro and the balance coal-fired thermal. It currently
serves approximately 505,000 subscribers.
Prior Bank Lending
2.02      The Bank has made three loans totaling US$85.6 million to EEEB,
246-CO in January 1960, 313-CO in May 1962, and 537-CO in June 1968. The
first two loans helped finance hydro and thermal generating plant additions
of 305 MW, including the Sesquile Dam for the Guatavita Reservoir (paragraph
4.07), and transmission line and distribution system extensions. The third
loan, US$18.0 million, helped finance the completion of the El Colegio 1/
hydroelectric plant of three 50 MW units and associated substations; construc-
tion of the Canoas hydroelectric plant of one 50 MW unit; another expansion of
the transmission and distribution systems; and engineering services. Works
financed by the first two loans were completed successfully although with a
delay of about a year and a half in the second project because of problems
encountered in tunnel construction. Completion of works under the third loan
was delayed by a variety of problems including delays in final engineering,
heavy rains, unstable penstock foundations, excessive vibration, cavitation,
and pressure fluctuations in one of penstocks, and delays in transmission
system bid tendering and evaluation, manufacturing, and land acquisition. All
works were, however, completed successfully and at a cost increase of only
12.5% over the appraisal estimate. Most of the increase was in local currency
costs borne by EEEB. Valuable experience for future construction work was
gained in addressing the second and third projects' problems with the geolo-
gical conditions in the area (paragraph 4.23). The Mesitas tunnels and
penstocks have been designed to avoid or minimize such problems to the extent
possible.
2.03      EEEB has complied with covenants established in the last loan
agreement, and the company's financial situation has proved to be better
than that of other public utilities in Colombia. The Bank's June 1977
Project Performance Audit Report for the loan concluded that EEEB's success
in this respect could be attributed to "better management, length of
continuous service of the same company executives, a less politicized
board of directors, a tariff policy which though less than satisfactory
resulted in more effective generation of internal resources, and provision
1/   Since renamed Dario Valencia.



- 12 -
of a single service to a large and dense market." These judgements may be
reaffirmed today with the exception that a greater number of senior management
changes have been made bringing new people into the company during the past
two years than had occurred in earlier years (paragraph 2.05).
Organization and Administration
2.04      EEEB is administered by a seven-member Board of Directors and a
General Manager appointed by the Board. The General Manager is responsible
for day-to-day operations and is assisted by four Assistant Managers heading,
respectively, the administrative, financial, technical and operations branches
of the organization (Attachment 2.1). The Board of Directors is headed by
the Mayor of Bogota, and consists, in addition, of two members elected by the
Municipal Council, three members chosen by the Council from lists submitted
by associations representative of banks, commerce, and industry in Bogota,
and one member chosen by the President of Colombia. This composition was
worked out in connection with the Bank's initial loan to EEEB (246-CO) and
has generally proven to be satisfactory.
2.05      Although EEEB has had a history of stable and competent management
during most of its association with the Bank, turnover in its senior management
increased during the past two years resulting in a significant reduction in
the number of experienced senior officers. This has been most pronounced in
the company's financial staff. Although day-to-day accounting operations
continue to function satisfactorily, the company is not adequately equipped to
handle its rapidly expanding financial planning and debt management require-
ments. Consequently, EEEB has agreed to strengthen its senior financial staff
during the next two years (paragraph 2.07).
Employment and Training
2.06      EEEB had 2,225 employees at the end of 1977, including a technical
staff of 102, an administrative staff of 601, and 1,522 operations personnel.
The history of the company's staff growth over the past ten years in relation
to the number of customers served and energy sold is summarized below. The
figures show an improving trend and compare favorably with those of electric
utilities which serve similar markets.
Number of       No. Customers      Annual Sales (MWh) /a
Employees       per Employee          per Employee
1968                1422              174                   1021
1971                1520              198                   1317
1974                1896              213                   1359
1977               "2225              216                   1587
/a   Includes bulk sales to other utilities.
The number of EEEB's employees is projected to grow at an average of about
5.5% per year through 1982 when Mesitas will be in service. The trends of
improving ratios of the numbers of customers to employees and of the annual
sales of MWh per employee are also expected to continue (Attachment 5.4).



- 13 -
2.07      Over 20 staff years of formal instruction per year are received by
EEEB's technical and operations personnel in technical schools and from
equipment suppliers. However, since little formal training is given to the
Company's financial staff, and because of the need for strengthening of its
financial management, EEEB has agreed to employ by January 31, 1979 a senior
financial advisor with qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of
employment acceptable to the Bank, and to carry out a training program for key
members of its financial staff.
Accounting and Auditing
2.08      EEEB's data processing and accounting are satisfactory.  Internal
auditing is carried out by a separate department under a General Auditor
responsible to the Board of Directors and appointed by the Mayor of Bogota.
Independent auditing of EEEB was carried out by an external auditor acceptable
to the Bank until 1977, at which time the function was taken over by the
Office of the Comptroller of Bogota. Because this does not satisfy the Bank's
requirements, EEEB has agreed that an independent auditor acceptable to the
Bank will also continue to be used, and that audited financial statements,
together with a detailed auditor's report, will be submitted to the Bank
within four months of the end of each financial year.
Billing and Collections
2.09      Meters are read and bills mailed on a bi-monthly basis.  Payment
must be made in person at various company offices and Banks located throughout
the city. EEEB has considered adding a payment by mail option, and rejected
it on reliability grounds. While accounts receivable for electricity oper-
ations grew substantially as a percentage of total annual operating revenue
during the past ten years through 1976, reaching 27% in that year, they
declined to 24% in 1977. EEEB has agreed to reduce them to no more than
20% of annual sales by December 31, 1978, and to no more than 19%, 18%, and
17%, respectively, in each of the following years through 1981 (Attachment
5.4).
Insurance
2.10      EEEB's insurance program provides coverage of major operating
facilities against fire and lightning damage. Somewhat broader coverage has
been obtained for warehouses, offices, and vehicles. EEEB has insurance
against earthquake damage to its main warehouse and office buildings, but
earthquake coverage for the operating plants is not available. EEEB plans to
continue its program, and has required that its contractors obtain appropriate
coverage for works in progress under the Mesitas Project.

3. THE POWER MARKET
Historic
3.01      In 1976 electricity requirements in Colombia totalled approximately
14,600 GWh. The Central Market (comprising areas on the Pacific -oast and the
interior served mainly by EEEB, EPM, CVC-CHIDRAL and ICEL-CHEC) accounted for
about 76% of the total, the Atlantic Coast Market (CORELCA) for about 14%, and
numerous isolated electricity companies for about 3%.  The remainder of 1% was
generated by industrial plants for their own purposes.
3.02      The 1972-76 market statistics for ISA's shareholders are summarized
below.

during 1972-76 may be explained in part by rapid expansion in urban
networks and increased theft; it is excessive and will be the subject
of special investigation by ISA, as agreed in connection with the San
Carlos loan.
During 1973-76, gross electricity production increased at an annual average
rate of about 10.2% compared with GNP growth of about 6%. Sales increased
at about 9.2% annually, varying from a low of 6.1% for the CVC-CHIDRAL system
to a high of 11.7% for ICEL's system. EEEB's sales increased at an average
rate of 10.8% annually. The percentage of total sales represented by each of
the various major consumer categories (i.e., Residential, Industrial) remained
virtually unchanged throughout the period.

Interconnected System Forecasts
3.03      The projected demand and energy requirements shown below are based
on EEEB's and ISA's analysis of past trends and on a study of the correlation
between power sector growth and growth of GNP. Gross energy requirements in
the interconnected system are expected to increase at an average annual rate
of about 10.6% during the next eight years, and EEEB's requirements at an
average of approximately 11.1% per year.

3.04      To meet forecast requirements for the national interconnected system
by 1985, about 3,270 MW in new effective generating capacity, including the
proposed Mesitas Project, will be added to the 3,751 MW (effective) installed
at the end of 1977. 1977-85 energy and capacity balances are summarized below:

Even with the planned plant construction, however, capacity margins will be
low through 1985. Given the preponderance of hydro capacity in the system,
total effective capacity could be reduced by as much as 20% during dry years
due to the lower water head above the turbines. It is therefore possible that
load shedding could occur during times of peak usage.
EEEB Forecast
3.05      Gross energy and capacity requirements for EEEB through 1982, the
first year of Mesitas operation, are shown in Attachment 3.1. EEEB plans to
invest approximately US$280 million equivalent for expansion of its distribu-
tion system during 1978-82. Total customers served would increase from
481,700 in 1977 to approximately 752,200 in 1982. Of the 270,500 new connec-
tions, 235,300 would be residential, including over 40,000 in the lowest
consumption category (those consuming less than 100 kWh/month). Engineering
planning for distribution expansion is underway, and the Bank is considering
the possibility of future lending operations with EEEB in this area.
3.06      Until Mesitas becomes available in 1982, Bogota's growing energy
requirements will be filled by, first, an increase in the supply from ISA
and, second, increased generation in EEEB's existing hydro plants as
additional water becomes available in 1980 from the Chingaza diversion
(paragraph 4.04). In 1982 after the commissioning of Mesitas, EEEB's need for
energy from ISA will be reduced slightly, and EEEB will become almost self-
sufficient in satisfying its own peak demand for power. Further growth from
1982 will, however, be entirely dependent on increases in both energy and
power supplied by ISA, since Mesitas will be fully used as soon as it enters
into service in 1982.
3.07      The distribution of projected sales between the different
categories of consumers in EEEB's market, as shown in Attachment 3.1, is
summarized below in comparison with figures from the past five years. The
most prominent feature of the projections is the substantially larger growth
expected in residential consumption than in the other sectors, continuing
the trend of the past five years.

3.08      As can be seen in Attachment 3.1, EEEB expects losses and theft
as a percentage of power delivered to EEEB's system (including station use),
to increase from 14.5% in 1977 to 15.8% in 1978 as a result of the large
tariff increases and increases in connection charges being put into effect,
and to decline thereafter to 14.6% by 1982.

EEEB's Program
4.02      EEEB's 1978-82 investment program includes:  the Mesitas hydropower
development; remedial work on the Sesquile dam to strengthen it against
possible future earthquake damage and to increase its regulating capability;
distribution and sub-transmission expansions; and new central facilities
required by the increasing size and complexity of the Company's operations.
Of a total investment of US$557 million planned for the period, US$262 million
is for generation and US$277 million is for distribution/sub-transmission.
US$78.7 million of the proposed loan of US$84 million would apply to the
Mesitas development, US$4.9 million to remedial work on the Sesquile Dam, and
US$0.4 million to financial consultants and training for EEEB's financial
staff (paragraphs 4.11, 4.15, 5.07).

The Project
4.03      Mesitas.  The precipitous fall of the Bogota River starting just
west of Bogota permits an unusually low cost power development in the Mesitas
Project (estimated at US$418 per installed kW) with construction consisting
mainly of tunnels and penstocks connected to two surface powerhouses with
high head power units. The large dams normally associated with hydropower
are not needed, and access and transmission are not costly due to the
proximity of the load center and ISA points of connection to the Central
system. The tunnel alignment and the two plants will lie to the south and
generally parallel with EEEB's present hydropower system, which consists
of four plants: Canoas (50 MW), Salto I and II (120 MW), Laguneta (80 MW)
and Dario Valencia (300 MW). These plants lie along the Bogota River, are

operated in series using an average regulated flow of 21 m3/s, and develop
a gross head of 1,830 m. River regulation is provided by three upstream
tributary reservoirs and the Muna pumped storage head pond. The Mesitas
tunnel will begin at this pond, and additional pumping capacity will be
provided for it.
4.04      Engineering planning has long anticipated paralleling the existing
system of plants with larger ones as additional water becomes available
through diversions from nearby drainage basins to the Bogota River system.
The first stage of the Chingaza domestic/industrial water supply project for
Bogota, financed through Loan 747-CO of 1971, will provide in 1980 the first
diversion of 14 m3/s. This with the existing 21 m3/s regulated flow plus an
additional average of some 4 m3/s of hitherto unusable existing flow will
increase EEEB's annual average hydro generation from approximately 2,320 GWh
to 4,305 GWh once Mesitas is built.
4.05      Mesitas will utilize a gross head of 1,927 m through 14.6 km of
tunnels, 358 m of vertical shafts, and 7.24 km of surface penstocks, to
develop 600 MW in its two plants, each of 3 units. The Mesitas tunnels and
penstocks are sized for a maximum flow of 70 m3/s although the design flow
for full turbine output is only 35 m3/s. The powerhouses are designed for
easy expansion so that, at a future date when further diversions are made to
the Bogota basin, the generating capacity at each powerhouse can be doubled.
In the meantime, as a result of the larger diameter tunnels and penstocks, the
reduction in friction losses for operation of the current project's turbines
will permit additional output having a present value estimated at approximately
the incremental cost of the larger diameter.
4.06      The main elements of the Mesitas Project are discussed below.
Pumping Station for Muna Head Pond - The existing Muna pumped storage
pond of 41 million m3 is the key link in the operation of EEEB's existing and
proposed hydro facilities because it provides the weekly regulation required
for efficient use of Bogota River flows.3 These flows vary because the three
regulating reservoirs with 890 million m storage are far upstream and control
only 15% of the drainage area. In a sense, the pond serves the same function
for the series of downstream power plants as would the reservoir of a normal
hydro power development with generating facilities adjacent to the dam. The
present pump capacity of 12 ma/s will be increased in the Project by 52.5 m3/s
through construction of a pumping station with three 10,000 horsepower pumps
and a 412 m x 3.5 m diameter steel penstock. Pumping power would be supplied
through a 1 km, 115 kV transmission line.
El Paraiso Power Plant - This will be the first of the two Mesitas plants
downstream from Muna, where a new intake structure will rbe built. The first
tunnel section, 1.4 km, will feed a 379 m syphon connecting to an 11.1 km
tunnel section terminating in a two-level surge chamber and valve house.
From there, a 4 km penstock will feed the El Paraiso surface powerhouse with
three 90 MW units. El Paraiso will develop a gross head of 892 m.



- 23 -
La Guaca Powerplant - The 373 m El Paraiso tailrace tunnel will terminate
in a 171 m shaft feeding a 1.3 km tunnel connecting to a 3.3 km penstock.
From the penstock, a 187 m shaft will feed a final 2.1 km tunnel to the La
Guaca surface powerhouse with three 110 MW units. La Guaca will develop
a gross head of 1035 m. Its tailrace will discharge to the Bogota River about
3 km downstream of the last of the existing plants.
Transmission - El Paraiso and La Guaca will be linked by a double circuit
230 kV, 8 km transmission line. La Guaca and La Mesa, an ISA interconnection
point, will be linked by a double circuit 230 kV, 6 km line. La Guaca and La
Torca, a major system substation east of Bogota will be linked by a double
circuit 230 kV, 86 km line. The El Paraiso and La Guaca switchyards will each
contain six three-phase transformers.
Project Roads - Access roads to all project elements have been completed.
4.07      Sesquile - The Sesquile dam was financed in part through Loan 246-CO
in 1960. It is located on the Siecha River just upstream of its confluence
with the Bogota River, approximately 56 km upstream of Bogota. The reservoir
(Guatavita), with a capacity of 690 million m3, provides 74% of the storage
available for power generation in the Bogota River system of power plants.
It is operated to store not only the runoff of the Siecha River, but also,
through pumping, excess flows of the Bogota River. The pump station, designed
for 3 pump units, presently has one rated for 8 m3/s. An additional unit is
to be added in 1980.
4.08      The dam is an earthfill structure founded on sand dumped into a
dredged excavation. Following its completion, observation of liquefaction
failures in earthquakes in Japan in 1964, Alaska in 1964, and California in
1971 led to a much better understanding of liquefaction phenomena in loose
sands under earthquake excitations. Foundation liquefaction and consequent
slumping of the Sesquile dam are possible under seismic conditions originating
from an active fault 45 kilometers distant. Although the risk of such a
failure is slight, there is no responsible option other than to proceed with
appropriate strengthening measures.
4.09      A detailed restudy of seismicity of the region and of the hazard of
foundation liquefaction was carried out by Ingetec (Colombia) with the assist-
ance of expert consultants. These studies indicate that the site is in a
region where strong earthquakes may occur, and that, in the event of the
maximum possible earthquake, dam failure is probable. Studies were then
carried out by Ingetec with the assistance of US consultants Woodward-Lundgren
and Associates and Professor H.B. Seed of the University of California, of
methods for improving the dam's stability. Appropriate methods have been
agreed upon!,; involving construction of stabilizing berms both upstream and
downstream, with densification of loose sand underlying the downstream berm
through a series of vertical and horizontal drains. About 1.4 million m3 of
earthwork is required.

4.11      The Mesitas and Sesquile base estimates were prepared by Ingetec
for EEEB using mid-1977 price levels including two already awarded civil works
contracts (paragraph 4.18) covering approximately 90% of the Mesitas civil

works and involving the Mesitas items most prone to estimating errors. Even
though the contracts have been let, the estimate includes physical contingen-
cies averaging about 26% for underground work and 14% for surface work. These
allowances are reasonable. A 10% physical contingency is included for equip-
ment. The base estimate includes 4,720 staffmonths of consulting services at
an average of US$3,475 per staffmonth for engineering and supervision of
project construction. Most of this work will be done by local consultants.
The figure for financial consultants and training is based on an estimated
foreign consultant effort of 35 staffmonths, at US$8,000 per staffmonth
including travel costs, for a proposed asset valuation study (5.07); on an
allowance of US$100,000 for a senior financial advisor for up to two years;
and on an allowance of_US$20 000 for training for the company's senior finan-
cial staff.
4.12      The assumptions regarding foreign price increases used in deriving
the price contingency figures are shown in the table below.

Internal inflation was assumed to decrease gradually from 36% in 1977 to 8%
by 1982, remaining constant thereafter. The average exchange rate (Col$ 36.50
per US$ in 1977) was assumed to increase to Col$ 58.58 per US$ by 1984.
4.13      Project Financing.  The total project foreign exchange cost of
US$148.4 million equivalent consists of US$143.1 million equivalent for
Mesitas, US$4.9 million for Sesquile, and US$.4 million equivalent for the
financial consultants and training. A Bank loan of US$84.0 million equiva-
lent is proposed, representing 57% of these costs. The loan would finance
the portions of the Project indicated below. No retroactive financing is
proposed. Financing of local costs is discussed in paragraphs 5.11-5.16.

sources (US$10.2 million by Colombia's Electricity Fund) will cover the
Project's initial foreign exchange requirements.
4.15      The proposed loan would include:  US$28.1 million for underground
civil works to cover all remaining foreign costs for construction of the
Mesitas tunnels and shafts; US$3.9 million for aboveground civil works for the
two powerhouses, the Muna III pump station, and the El Paraiso auxiliary
tailrace; US$8.4 million to be applied to downpayments for the major items of
equipment listed in footnote b/ of the table in paragraph 4.10; US$37.2
million for the equipment for the Muna III pump station, transmission lines,
numerous other relatively small items not suitable for export financing, and
for equipment erection; US$1.1 million for the estimated cost of foreign
engineering consultants expected to be needed in implementing the Project;
US$400,000 for financial consultants and training; and US$4.9 million for
Sesquile Dam strengthening.
4.16      Engineering and Administration.  EEEB has retained Ingetec for many
years for development and project studies, detailed engineering design, and
construction supervision. This arrangement has worked well in the past and
the quality of both EEEB's and Ingetec's technical work has been considered
good by the Bank. EEEB has assumed a fairly substantial role in project
execution while continuing to maintain a dialogue with Ingetec during all
phases. This same arrangement is being followed with the Mesitas Project,



- 27 -
but with different engineering firms carrying out the construction supervision
work because of the recent enactment of a law prohibiting public entities from
using the same engineering firm for both design and construction supervision.
The construction supervision of the underground work for Mesitas is being done
by a team of two Colombian firms, Hidroestudios and Restrepo Uribe. The
Mesitas excavation and foundation preparations are being supervised by the
Colombian firm Gomez Cajiao. EEEB expects to use other firms for design
and supervision of construction of the Mesitas transmission lines, and for
supervision of powerhouse construction.
4.17      Construction Schedule.  Mesitas civil works construction started in
October 1977 and will continue through the first half of 1981. Installation of
penstocks will start late in 1979. The time required for these two activities
determines the critical path for project completion, presently scheduled for
December 31, 1981. The schedule should be met barring unforeseen delays in
equipment deliveries, tunneling, or the penstock anchorage system. Work on
Sesquile is scheduled for completion in January 1982. The activities involved
are not complicated and the schedule should be met. Attachment 4.2 gives key
dates for project implementation which would be used to monitor progress.
4.18      Procurement.  All the items to be financed by the proposed loan
(except for consulting services) have been, or would be procured through
international competitive bidding (ICB) under Bank guidelines. Approximately
90% of the Mesitas civil works have been under contract since September 1977.
The largest part of these, the tunnel and shaft works, for which the proposed
loan would cover US$28.1 million in foreign exchange costs, was contracted
under ICB consistent with the Bank's guidelines with Impregilo (Italy).
The projected power rationing made it imperative to proceed with the work even
though no assurance of financing from the Bank was available. a/ If EEEB had
been required to delay the start of the work, until, say, November 1978
following an assumed October 1978 approval of the proposed Bank loan, at least
800 GWh of electricity would have been lost in 1982. This is approximately
15% of the estimated Bogota requirement during the period of the loss, and
would cause severe rationing. The Bank could not have asked EEEB to wait
under the circumstances.
4.19      A minor civil works contract covering Mesitas excavations and
foundation preparation was awarded to Conciviles (Colombia) in September 1977
after ICB. Contract award procedures were not in accordance with Bank
Guidelines, as EEEB exercised its right to place the contract with Conciviles
a/   In September 1977 when EEEB let the contracts, the chances appeared slim
for resolving within a reasonable period of time the outstanding issues
affecting the then appraised San Carlos I Hydro Power and 500 kV Inter-
connection projects. The Bank had not been willing to appraise the
Mesitas project prior to resolution of the San Carlos and Interconnection
difficulties (paragraph 1.09). The San Carlos/Interconnection issues
were resolved in November, and the Bank proceeded with the appraisal
of the Mesitas project in December 1977.

who submitted the third lowest bid. This decision was based on EEEB's
conviction that the two lowest bidders (also Colombian) were significantly
less qualified to carry out the work even though they had been prequalified by
EEEB. The contract is being financed entirely by EEEB.
4.20      EEEB is expected to procure the remaining uncontracted Mesitas civil
works, the Sesquile civil works, and all of the equipment for Mesitas and
Sesquile, under ICB consistent with the Bank's guidelines. Colombian manu-
facturers will participate in bidding for some of the equipment contracts.
They will be given a preference of the lower of 15% or the applicable custom
duty for bid evaluation purposes.
4.21      Disbursements.  Disbursements against civil works and equipment
contracts would be made against billings submitted to EEEB after the date of
the Bank's loan agreement. Disbursements would be for: (a) 100% of the
foreign expenditures for underground civil works, contracts awarded to non-
Colombian contractors for other civil works, and equipment and equipment
erection contracts awarded to non-Colombian suppliers; (b) 94% of the ex-
factory costs for locally manufactured materials and equipment; (c) 26% of the
cost of civil works contracts awarded to Colombian contractors; (d) 8% of the
cost of consultants for engineering and construction supervision (based on the
estimated foreign costs of these services); and (e) 100% of the cost of the
asset valuation study, financial advisor, and training program for financial
staff. Attachment 4.3 shows estimated loan disbursements, assuming loan
effectiveness in February 1979. All project work should be completed by end
1981, but retention money disbursements would continue through 1982. The loan
closing date would be December 31, 1982.
4.22      Environmental Aspects.  Mesitas causes no major population displace-
ments since most project elements are underground and in remote areas. Tunnel
and other earthwork spoil will be disposed of in areas selected for minimum
impact on arable lands or water sources. This is specified in the civil works
contracts. Access for work areas and land for surface penstocks and power-
houses requires about 368 hectares involving 247 properties. Acquisition of
216 of the properties has been completed, and upgrading of roads needed for
access to project areas for all weather vehicular use was welcomed by some of
the residents of the area. Acquisition of the 31 additional properties
has not yet been completed, principally because of disagreements over price.
EEEB has referred these cases back to the national appraisal agency responsible,
by law, for determining the prices in question. The matter is under discussion
between EEEB and the Bank and is expected to be resolved satisfactorily.
Rights-of-way and land needed for the transmission lines have not been acquired
inasmuch as the layouts of the lines are still being worked on.   EEEB has
agreed to carry out a plan satisfactory to the Bank for the evacuation, by
December 31, 1979, of the areas where the works included in the project will
be carried out, and to complete by June 30, 1980, the acquisition of all land
and rights-of-way required for the project.
4.23      Risks - The main physical risks associated with Mesitas will be in
the execution of the undergound works. The geology of the region is difficult,
with swelling shales, water, and methane gas, which caused serious problems
during construction of the last downstream plant of the existing system during



- 29 -
the 1960s. Although the geological conditions will not be completely known
until encountered during the work, the locations of problem areas are reason-
ably well known, and the tunnel and penstock alignments were selected to
minimize construction problems.
4.24      Geology was also a critical factor in the decision for a two-stage
design (e.g., two penstocks and powerhouses) instead of a one-stage design. A
one-stage penstock would have involved serious risks in its anchorage system
because of the poor surface geology of the area. This was a significant
problem in the construction of the existing system. In addition, some of the
Mesitas tunnel sections may require unusually heavy support, and gas and water
will likely be troublesome at times. However, this should not cause undue
difficulties for the contractor, who is well experienced. Finally, Mesitas is
in a seismically active area and is designed accordingly. This is another
reason the penstocks were kept short. Tunnels, however, when properly designed
are generally resistant to seismic shock, even in fault zones.
4.25      In April 1977, the Bank engaged Dr. A. Merritt, a U.S. engineering
geologist, to review the project's geological investigations, tunneling
methods, construction equipment, schedules, and cost estimates for underground
works. Dr. Merritt agreed with the scope of the exploration program performed
in the area of the proposed tunnels, with the proposed tunneling methods, and
with the engineer's unit cost estimates for the tunnels. He considered the
schedule for the works to be tight, and he suggested that further consideration
be given to the possibility of landslides adjacent to the surge pond at the El
Paraiso Plant. EEEB and Ingetec have made additional studies of the latter
problem and have included appropriate treatment in the program of civil works.
4.26      In view of the seismicity in the Mesitas and Sesquile areas, EEEB's
facilities, including the existing generating plants, should be appropriately
instrumented to monitor their soundness. EEEB has agreed to install the
necessary instrumentation, to carry out a satisfactory monitoring program, and
to engage qualified experts for periodic inspections of its facilities in
accordance with sound engineering practices.
4.27      In summary, while the project entails substantial physical risks,
the quality of the engineering and the substantial provisions for physical
contingencies should ensure that the work can be carried out within the esti-
mated cost. The schedule, while tight, has been accepted by the highly expe-
rienced contractor responsible for the underground civil works. Provided
equipment suppliers also accept the deadlines proposed in the respective
bidding documents, it should be feasible to complete the project on time.

5. FINANCE
Past Performance and Current Financial Position
5.01      EEEB has maintained a satisfactory financial position through most
of its 18-year relationship with the Bank. Even though its tariffs are among
the lowest in the world, its internal cash generation during the past ten years
has been sufficient to provide more than 50% of its annual investment needs,
including substantial recent contributions to ISA. This may be attributed in
large part to low-cost facilities, given the area's geographic advantages for
hydro generation and the high density of its market. The balance of the
company's investment funds have been obtained through borrowings, generally
at reasonable costs; no government funding has been required.
5.02      EEEB's average tariff declined in real terms over the period 1970-76
to a level of 1.2 US cents per kWh. However, the average tariff increased in
1977 to approximately 1.5 US cents per kWh with the beginning of a program of
increases expected to reach an average of 3.5 US cents in 1980 (paragraph
5.14 and Attachment 5.1). The June 1977 Project Performance Audit Report on
the previous loan to EEEB (537-CO) showed that rates of return through 1974,
the end of the appraisal forecast period for that loan, were approximately
equal to those which had been forecast and slightly above the 9% minimum
requirement. The report also noted, however, that these returns, including
the prescribed 9%, were not based upon fully revalued assets and that the
loan agreement's rate of return covenant therefore "was not entirely satis-
factory." Rates of return of 5.5%, 6.5%, and 7.1% were achieved during
1975-77 with respect to estimated fully revalued assets (Attachment 5.1);
these rates were adequate at the time because of the company's relatively
modest investments in those years.
5.03      At the end of 1977, EEEB's debt to equity ratio was 35/65 calculated
on the basis of revalued assets, with over 80% of the debt in long-term
obligations to the Bank and the IDB (Attachment 5.3). The Company's debt
service coverage ratio for 1977 was 2.4. The favorable structure of the
Company's debt and the planned tariff increases through 1980 place it in a
good position to obtain the additional debt financing which it will need from
commercial sources over and above that envisaged to be provided by IBRD
(paragraph 5.11).
5.04      EEEB's cash and working capital have been satisfactory in recent
years; its current ratio has exceeded 1.5 since 1974. Accounts receivable
as a percentage of annual sales had grown to 27% by the end of 1976, but
the figure dropped to 24% in 1977; EEEB has agreed to reduce it to 20% this
year and to 17% by 1981 (Attachment 5.4).
Rate Base
5.05      In 1967 in accordance with changes in Colombia's public utility
regulatory law, EEEB began to include in its balance sheet a revaluation
adjustment to its net fixed assets in service equal to the revaluation of
its outstanding foreign debt for changes in exchange rates. Prior to 1967,



- 34 -
gross fixed assets were shown on the Company's books at original costs, and
foreign debt revaluations were offset by compensating adjustments of the
Company's capital and retained earnings. For the 1967 asset revaluation,
EEEB used the full revaluation of its outstanding foreign debt since the
dates of incurrence; this amounted to an increase of 64.9% to the stimated
foreign component of the unrevalued net fixed asset base at the time. The
result obtained from this and subsequent years' revaluations, as determined
under law, included no allowances for the effect of inflation oin assets not
financed by foreign borrowings, or for the effect of international price
changes.
5.06      To establish a more satisfactory valuation for the San Carlos
appraisal and for the current appraisal, it was agreed with EEEB that an
increase of 64.9% would also be applied to the estimated local component of
the unrevalued net fixed asset base of 1967, and that the revised base would
be further adjusted according to the annual change in the national consumer
price index for workers for each year starting with 1967. The second 64.9%
increment was intended to provide at least a partial allowance for the effects
on 1967's value of local inflation prior to 1967. The resultant value brought
forward to 1976 according to subsequent changes in the consumer price index,
and further expanded by real additions (also revalued) to assets in service
since 1967, gave the following valuations as of December 31, 1976, which were
incorporated into the San Carlos shareholders' agreement: Gross fixed assets
in operation, 12,019 million pesos; accumulated depreciation on gross fixed
assets in operation, 3,769 million pesos; fixed assets in construction, 1,060
million pesos. Future calculations of asset values for use in measuring
EEEB's actual rates of return, according to the San Carlos agreement, must
begin with these base figures as of December 31, 1976.
5.07      The above valuation leads to relatively high rate of return require-
ments (paragraph 5.15) by comparison with other Bank power projects and with
electric utility standards in general. EEEB and the Bank have accepted the
figures as the best available at the present time; but because of the doubt
raised by the treatment of pre-1967 price increases, EEEB has agreed to commis-
sion a study to obtain a new valuation of its assets. The proposed loan
includes a provision of US$280,000 for such a study (paragraphs 4.11 and 4.15)
to be done by consultants under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank
beginning no later than April 30, 1979, and to be completed and made available
to the Bank by March 31, 1980. EEEB has agreed to exchange views by September 30,
1980, with the Bank, in the light of the results of the study and the Bank's
comments thereon, on the advisability of revising its asset valuation, its
asset valuation methodology, and its rate of return requirements.
Tariff Structure
5.08      Although EEEB's average tariff has begun to improve and is expected
to continue improving during the next two-and-one-half years (paragraph 5.14),
its tariff structure lacks appropriate balance among various major components.
This may be seen in the June 1977 rates shown below, inasmuch as the cost per
kWh of production and distribution of residential electricity should be at
least equal to that of industrial and commercial electricity.

5.09      Because tariff increases during 1977-78 have been greater for
industrial and commercial users than for residential users, the spread between
average residential and average industrial/commercial prices is widening.
Moreover, the gap is also widening because in September 1977 Bogota's municipal
authorities exempted residential consumers of 300 kWh per month and less from
the monthly tariff adjustments which have taken place since then under the
1977-1980 plan of tariff increases (paragraph 5.14). Although the effect of
the exemption has been insignificant to date, the revenue lost would amount to
approximately 5% of EEEB's projected total revenue if continued through 1982.
5.10      The Government and ISA's shareholders agreed under the San Carlos
loan to carry out studies of the costs of service to final consumers and of
their implications for pricing. The studies and the Government's views on
appropriate follow-up tariff policies and actions are to be discussed with
the Bank by June 30, 1979 (paragraph 1.25). EEEB has agreed to prepare by
October 1, 1979, on the basis of these studies and the Bank's comments on
them, a program satisfactory to the Bank to revise the structure of its
tariffs and rates. EEEB has agreed to put the program into effect by
April 30, 1980. The purpose of the program will be to revise the structure
of the Borrower's tariffs and rates such that, for each category of consumers
(residential, industrial, commercial and governmental) the aggregate tariffs
and rates charged to the category, as a whole, will cover approximately the
cost of the services received by the category, except that the revision will
also take into account the income redistribution policies of the Government
benefitting the lowest-income consumers. The adjustment of tariffs and rates
under the program will be carried out in approximately equal annual amounts
over a period ending no later than June 30, 1982.

Financing Plan
5.11      EEEB's 1978-82 financial requirements consist of:  (a) the planned
investments in the Mesitas and Sesquile facilities (the proposed project);
(b) investments to modernize and expand the Company's subtransmission and
distribution system; (c) investments in supporting facilities including a
central maintenance facility, a new headquarters office, and a new central
control facility; (d) investments in ISA, mainly for construction of new
generating facilities; (e) increases in working capital. Approximately 55%
of the needed US$929 million equivalent will be generated within the power
sector through revenues and direct capital contributions from users. EEEB
plans to obtain the balance through borrowings, mainly from international
sources, including the proposed US$84 million equivalent Bank loan. The
Company's financing plan for 1978-82 is summarized below:

US$46.7 million equivalent would be disbursed through December 31, 1982.
5.12      The terms used in calculating the above figures for EEEB's
borrowings have been conservatively estimated as follows:



- 38 -
(a) Proposed IBRD loan for Mesitas: interest 7.75%, maturity
17 years, including four years of grace;
(b) Possible future IBRD loans for distribution expansion:
interest 8.0%, maturity 17 years, including three years grace;
(c) Suppliers credits: interest 8.0%, maturity 10 years, including
three years grace; and
(d) Medium-term borrowings: debt in dollars, interest 9.0%, maturity
seven years, including two years grace.
Effectiveness of the proposed Mesitas loan would be contingent upon obtaining
satisfactory assurances of the availability of the additional financing
needed by EEEB for the project. It is reasonable to expect that EEEB will
obtain the additional financing in view of its satisfactory financial position,
its planned tariff increases, and the substantial interest already shown by
commercial lenders. Moreover, the Government has agreed to assist EEEB, if
and to the extent necessary, in obtaining the financing needed to complete the
project.
5.13      To ensure adherence to the proposed financing plan until the project
is completed, EEEB has agreed not to undertake without the prior agreement
of the Bank, investments (excluding those for the project, for other new
generating plant in excess of 100 MW which is economically justified as part
of ISA's national power expansion program, for transmission and distribution
expansion up to US$45 million per year in 1979-82, and for the company's
obligations to ISA) exceeding in any year 1% of the estimated value of the
company's fully revalued net fixed assets in service at the end of the year.
Future Finances
5.14      The projected cash generation in EEEB's financing plan is based on
the Company's plan of tariff increases through 1980 (assuming that any revenue
lost as a result of the exemption from tariff increases of residential con-
sumers of less than 300 kwh per month (paragraph 5.09) will be made up by
compensating tariff increases to other consumers), on the inflation assumptions
indicated in paragraph 4.12, and on the assumption that the end 1980 average
tariff level will be maintained in real terms thereafter. The tariff plan
calls for across-the-board increases of 2.2% each month through the end of
1980; it was authorized by the National Tariff Commission in October 1977, and
is being implemented except for the exemption from increases for consumers of
less than 300 kWh per month. a/ The plan also includes one-time increases
of 8.0% to residential rates and 15.0% to all other rates which took place on
May 1, 1978.  The resultant real increase in the average rate from January 1,
1978 to January 1, 1981 will be approximately 54% (or an average increase of
15.5% per year).
a/   EEEB would have to request an additional authorization from the National
Tariff Commission to make compensating increases to offset the effect of
the exemption.



- 39 -
5.15      EEEB's net operating income with the above program is expected to
produce rates of return on fully revalued assets ranging from 7.8% in 1978
to 16.8% in 1981, and then declining back to 12.4% by 1984 (Attachment 5.1).
These expected rates form the basis for the rate of return covenant for EEEB
under the San Carlos loan, which is repeated in the proposed loan agreement.
The covenant calls for achievement of an annual return of at least 12.0% per
year beginning with 1978, and specifies that any shortfall in an actual return
is to be carried forward and added to the return required for the following
year. The Bank and EEEB have accepted the figure of 12% starting in 1978
despite the forecast of lower outcomes for 1978 and 1979 because the forecast
average for the period 1978-80 as a whole is 12% and because the agreed carry-
over provision in effect provides the necessary annual flexibility while
requiring the achievement of this average. Higher returns beyond 1980 are
not specified because of the uncertainty about the underlying asset values
upon which the figures were based (paragraph 5.07). EEEB has therefore agreed
to a contribution to investment covenant in the proposed loan agreement
(paragraph 5.16) to assure the income needed during the period 1981-84. For
years beyond 1984, the existing requirement for a rate of return of at least
12% would be reconfirmed under the proposed loan agreement.
5.16      EEEB's projected funds from internal sources as a percentage of
its total investment requirements during the period 1981-84 are as follows:
Current Col$ Millions
1981     1982      1983     1984    1981-84

a/   Net internal cash generation plus cash contributions (Attachment 5.2).
The percentage over the four years 1981-84 is 72.7%. EEEB has agreed to
maintain a cumulative ratio averaging at least 73.0% during the four years.
5.17      To further ensure that the required levels of cash generation will
be achieved, EEEB has also agreed to review within the first two months of
each calendar quarter the adequacy of its tariffs, including approved future
tariffs, to produce the required income for the year. (A similar provision
with respect to EEEB's rate of return requirements was agreed under the San
Carlos I loan.) Should any quarterly review indicate that EEEB will not
obtain sufficient income during the year, approval of an appropriate program
of tariffs to correct the deficiency would be promptly obtained. EEEB has
agreed to furnish to the Bank the results of its quarterly reviews by the end
of the second month of the quarter.
5.18      EEEB's projected debt service coverage ratio (see Attachment 5.4)
will be above 3.0 during 1978-80 as a result of the substantial revenue
increases expected and the grace periods in effect for most of the foreign



- 40 -
borrowings obtained during the period. In subsequent years, the ratio is
expected to fall to about 2.5 as a result of the levelling off of the Company's
average tariff in real terms and the initiation of new amortization payments.
The debt to equity ratio will increase slightly from the current proportion of
approximately 34/66 during the next two years, but should then decline to
31/69 by the end of 1984. Although these projected ratios are satisfactory,
EEEB has agreed to a debt limitation covenant which would provide that long-
term debt would not be incurred without the Bank's concurrence if EEEB's gross
internal cash generation is less than 1.5 times its maximum future debt service
requirement for existing debt plus the proposed new debt to be incurred.
5.19      EEEB's projected current ratio shows a decline toward marginal
levels by 1981, mainly because of increases in amounts of long and medium-term
debt currently payable given the projected growth in total debt, the growing
proportion of medium-term debt within the total, and the expiration of grace
periods. Cash has been projected on the basis of historical proportions with
respect to expenses, and projected cash and accounts receivable together
comprise approximately 50% of total current assets, which is a satisfactory
proportion. The possibility that liquidity problems might arise could call
for an additional tariff increase of a few percentage points in 1979 or 1980,
but this is by no means certain.
5.20      It should be noted that the projected net income, funds flows, and
balance sheets shown in Attachments 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 include a notional
treatment of EEEB's costs and liabilities for pensions and other retirement
benefits, inasmuch as adequate detailed information was not available. EEEB
has therefore agreed to provide to the Bank by December 31, 1979:  (a) detailed
projections of its future liabilities to its retired employees and of the
sources of funds and reserves to be maintained to meet these obligations; and
(b) detailed supporting actuarial and financial analyses.
Performance Indicators and Financial Reporting
5.21      Attachment 5.4 contains a selection of indicators reflecting the
expected improvements in EEEB's performance during project execution. They
would be used as a basis for monitoring performance and call for significant
reductions in the levels of theft and losses and in accounts receivable in
relation to sales. They also reflect other measures necessary to ensure
satisfactory financial performance. EEEB has agreed to provide to the Bank
every three months satisfactory performance indicator and financial reports,
including once every six months up-to-date seven-year financial forecasts with
the details shown in Attachments 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4, plus appropriate
backup information. These reports plus quarterly reports to the Bank on
EEEB's performance in meeting its agreed rate of return and cash generation
targets, should enable EEEB and the Bank to identify deviations from the
agreed financial performance early enough to permit timely corrective action.

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost Justification
6.01      The Mesitas Project is the least cost available alternative for
meeting the needs of the interconnected system in early 1982 (San Carlos I
and 500-kV Interconnection Projects staff appraisal report, No. 1850a-CO).
Internal Rate of Return
6.02      The internal rate of return on the Mesitas Project has been calculated
as the discount rate at which the present value of estimated costs and benefits
attributable to the project are equal. The measure of project benefits used
was the estimated revenue from the incremental electricity sales in EEEB's
distribution network that can be attributed to Mesitas, and the estimated
reduction in fuel consumption which Mesitas will engender in existing thermal
plant during the two years in which its full output is being absorbed by the
growth of demand in Bogota. In national terms, the growth of gross demand in
Colombia in 1982 (the year in which Mesitas will enter into operation) is
estimated at 2,304 GWh, sufficient to absorb Mesitas' average annual output of
1987 GWh, and a minimum estimate of the benefits of Mesitas' output could be
taken as the national average revenue per kilowatt-hour. However, due to the
lack of nation-wide subtransmission and distribution cost data, it is not
possible to estimate the costs associated with this approach. On the other
hand, EEEB's figures for projected investments in subtransmission and distri-
bution are available (Attachment 5.2). As a result, incremental sales in
EEEB's distribution network, as shown in Attachment 6.1, have been valued at
the projected average 1981 EEEB revenue per kWh of 2.40 US cents/kWh (mid 1977
market prices) 1/, and the investment and incremental operating costs in
subtransmission and distribution facilities necessary to deliver Mesitas power
have been estimated on the basis of Mesitas' share in satisfying incremental
gross demand in EEEB's distribution network (Attachment 6.2). Connection
charges collected by EEEB during the period in which Mesitas is satisfying the
incremental demand in Bogota are included in the measure of project benefits
as detailed in Attachment 6.2.
6.03      Mesitas' output over and above that part which meets incremental
EEEB demand has the effect of reducing EEEB's purchases from ISA, and, hence,
reducing generation from existing thermal plant elsewhere in the interconnected
system. These fuel savings last during 1982 and 1983 only, after which growth
of EEEB demand will have covered all of Mesitas' output, as shown in Attachment
6.1.
1/   The December 1977 average rate of 1.56 USJ/kWh will have increased by
54% in real terms by January 1981 (para 5.14), to 2.40 USJ/kWh (mid 1977
prices).

6.04      The costs attributed to Mesitas consist of investment and operating
costs for the project and associated transmission and distribution facilities.
Attachment 6.2 details the factors used to convert domestic market prices to
border prices, as well as other assumptions used to derive costs and benefits.
Attachment 6.3 shows the cost and benefit streams of the project.
6.05      The internal rate of return based on the above minimum estimate of
benefits is 10.4%, which is close to the estimated opportunity cost of capital
in Colombia of 11%. This close correspondence between the project's internal
return, as measured by future projected tariffs, and the opportunity cost of
capital, indicates the appropriateness of the tariff increases planned through
1980 (para. 5.14), which will lead to a narrowing of the gap between tariffs
and the marginal cost of electricity supply. 1/ The rate of return's sensitiv-
ity to various changes in project costs and benefits is shown below and in
Attachment 6.4:
Condition                             Internal Rate of Return (%)
Base case                                                     10.4
Project sales and connection charges
down 15%; up 15%                                       8.5          12.3
Project investment costs down 15%; up 15%               11.9           9.4
Distribution costs down 15%; up 15%                     11.3           9.8
All benefits down 10%; all costs up 10%                        7.9
6.06      The rate of return is rather insensitive to variations in fuel
savings benefits and project operation and maintenance costs (see Attachment
6.4). As is noted in paragraph 4.27, the cost estimate is felt to include
sufficient physical contingency provisions. The principal uncertainty which
could lead to a reduction in the project's return is the possibility of lower-
than-expected revenues due to slower growth of sales or lower tariff increases
than currently planned. A reduction in return for these reasons, however,
seems unlikely since EEEB has agreed to maintain an adequate level of income.
1/   A measure of this gap is the fact that with benefits valued at the
December 1977 average tariff of 1.56 USJ/kWh, the project's internal
rate of return would be about 6%.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following points:
(a)  EEEB would employ by January 31, 1979, a senior financial advisor
with qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of employ-
ment acceptable to the Bank, and would carry out a training program
satisfactory to the Bank for members of its financial staff (2.07);
(b)  EEEB would reduce its accounts receivable to no more than 20% of its
annual sales by December 31, 1978, and to no more than 19%, 18%, and
17%, respectively, in each of the following years through 1981
(2.09);
(c)  EEEB would, by December 31, 1979, carry out a plan satisfactory
to the Bank for the evacuation of the areas where the works
included in the project will be carried out, and would, by
June 30, 1980, complete the acquisition of all land and rights-
of-way required for the project (4.22);
(d)  EEEB would install instrumentation, carry out a satisfactory
monitoring program, and engage experts for periodic inspections
of its facilities to insure their soundness (4.26);
(e)  EEEB would commission by April 30, 1979, a study to obtain a valua-
tion of its assets by independent consultants satisfactory to the
Bank, and under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, which
would be completed and made available to the Bank by March 31,
1980 (5.07);
(f)  In light of the results of the above study and the Bank's
comments thereon, EEEB would exchange views with the Bank by
September 30, 1980, on the advisability of revising its asset
valuation, its asset valuation methodology, and its rate of
return requirements (5.07);
(g)  EEEB would prepare a program of tariff and rate structure revisions,
satisfactory to the Bank, by October 1, 1979, and would put the
program into effect by April 30, 1980 (5.10);
(h)  EEEB would not undertake without prior agreement of the Bank until
the project is completed, any investments (excluding those for the
project, for other new generating plant in excess of 100 MW which is
economically justified as part of ISA's national power expansion
program, for transmission and distribution expansion up to US$45
million per year in 1979-82, and for the company's obligations to
ISA) exceeding in any year 1% of the estimated value of the company's
fully revalued net fixed assets in service at the end of the year
(5.13);



- 52 -
(i)  EEEB would earn a rate of return on fully revalued net fixed
assets in operation of not less than 12.0% as from 1978
(5.15);
(j)  EEEB's cumulative funds from internal sources during 1981-84 would
be no less than 73.0% of its cumulative investments in fixed assets
and in ISA during the period (5.16);
(k)  The Government would assist EEEB, if and to the extent necessary,
in obtaining financing needed to complete the project (5.12);
(1)  EEEB would not incur additional long-term debt without the
concurrence of the Bank unless its gross internal cash generation
is at least 1.5 times its maximum future debt service require-
ment for existing debt plus the proposed new debt to be incurred
(5.18);
(m)  EEEB would, by December 31, 1979, provide the Bank detailed projec-
tions of its liabilities to its retired employees and of its means
for meeting these obligations, plus detailed supporting actuarial
and financial analyses (5.20);
(n)  EEEB would provide to the Bank satisfactory performance indicator
and financial reports including up-to-date seven-year forecasts with
the details shown in Attachments 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 in this
appraisal document, plus appropriate backup information (5.21).
7.02      Effectiveness of the proposed loan would be contingent upon the
Bank's receipt of satisfactory assurances regarding other financing for the
project needed by EEEB (5.12).
7.03      With the agreements listed above, the project would provide a suit-
able basis for a loan of US$84.0 million to EEEB. The loan would be repaid
over a period of 17 years with four years of grace.
