1.1     Context at Appraisal
PNPM (Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat) is the Government of
Indonesia’s (GOI) national flagship community empowerment program. The program
builds on a series of successful Bank-supported rural and urban community development
projects that were implemented between 1998 and 2006. The name “PNPM? actually
represents a cluster of programs focusing on rural, urban, and disadvantaged areas. This
cluster of programs is financed in part by the GOI and is supported by various Credits,
Loans and Grants from different Development Partners. 1 The program also benefits from
a large Multi-Donor Trust Fund which supports supervision, analytical work, and a
number of innovative pilot operations. 2 This ICR covers the implementation of a subset
of these sources of financing, namely (a) a credit (IDA-43850) to the amount of SDR
119.5 million (US$ 190.0 million equivalent) and a loan (IBRD-75050) to the amount of
US$ 41.19 million approved in 2008; and (b) an additional financing (AF) loan (IBRD -
76660) to the amount of US$ 300.0 million which was approved in 2009. The combined
“project? funded by the original loan and credit, plus the AF Loan, is subsequently
referred to as PNPM Rural 1&2.

30 years of poverty reduction, with poverty rates dropping from more than 50% in 1970
to less than 20% in 1997. However, when the economic crisis hit in July 1997, it
unraveled years of progress achieved towards sustainable poverty reduction and plunged
more than 40% of Indonesia’s population below the poverty line.

At the time of appraisal of PNPM Rural, financed by IDA-43850 and IBRD-75050,
Indonesia had made a strong recovery from the aftermath of the financial crisis. Although
the number of people living below the poverty line had declined to pre-financial crisis
levels, about 110 million “near poor? people continued to live on less than US$2 a day.
Poor households had benefitted less from growth than wealthier households. The
unemployment rate was also high, calculated at an estimated 10.9 million people, or
about 10.3%of the total workforce. These poor and disadvantaged populations were

  In addition to PNPM Rural 1&2, which are covered by this ICR, the Bank and other Development
Partners supported the GOI’s cluster of community empowerment programs through: (a) a series of World-
Bank financed PNPM Urban Projects; (b) a World Bank-financed Credit and Loan in support of
Disadvantaged Areas; (c) an IFAD-financed Loan and Grant providing additional financing to PNPM 1&2;
(d) an ADB-financed Rural Infrastructure Support Loan; and (e) a JICA-financed Regional Infrastructure
for Social and Economic Development Loan. While these loans, credits, and grants all contributed to the
broader PNPM Program, they fall out of the scope of PNPM 1&2 and are hence not covered in this ICR,
with the exception of the PNPM Generasi Pilot operation, which was financed out of the proceeds of
PNPM Rural 1&2. The IFAD- Loan and Grant providing additional financing to PNPM Rural 1&2 close in
2016, and are therefore also not covered by this ICR.

vulnerable to external shocks and at risk of falling back into poverty in the event of
sickness, a natural disaster, unemployment, or harvest failure. They also had extremely
limited access to basic services, such as health, education, and housing, as well as capital,
and infrastructure.

In 2007, President Yudhoyono launched PNPM as the basic framework for all central
government poverty reduction programs. PNPM built on two existing poverty reduction
models - community empowerment in rural and urban areas through the Kecamatan
Development Project (KDP), and the Urban Poverty Project (UPP). KDP was launched
by the GOI in 1998. It was a national program implemented by the Ministry of Home
Affairs to alleviate poverty. At the time of the appraisal of PNPM Rural 1 in 2007, KDP
was in its third phase. The program provided block grants of approximately Rp. 500
million to 1.5 billion (approximately US$56,000 to US$165,000) to sub-districts
(kecamatan), depending upon the population size. KDP established mechanisms whereby
villagers could engage in a participatory planning and decision-making process to
determine the appropriate allocation of resources, based on their self-determined needs
and priorities. From 1998 to 2006, KDP covered 34,233 of the poorest villages in
Indonesia - approximately 49 percent of the 69,956 villages in the country. Total funding
reached almost US$1.4 billion with the majority of funds coming from the World Bank.

The table below provides an overview of the financial composition of the various phases
of KDP.

   (a) The GOI subsequently added USD30 million in fuel subsidy funds.

UPP, the urban sister program of KDP, followed similar principles but focused on urban
communities. It was implemented through the Ministry of Public Works.

Based on the KDP and UPP experiences, PNPM was meant to support the introduction of
a unified system and design for program delivery, better national targeting of the poorest,
direct transfer of funds to villages, and increased allocations for block grants. It also
included a pilot program, PNPM Generasi, in 160 poor and remote sub-districts in 5
provinces, focusing on how best to incorporate into the PNPM approach the achievement
of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce poverty, maternal mortality, and


                                                 2
child mortality, and to ensure universal coverage of basic education. This pilot program
was also financed under PNPM Rural 1&2. In addition, the national coverage of PNPM
intended to strengthen the Government’s capacity for ex post and ex ante disaster risk
management at the local level.

Rationale for Bank Assistance. The Bank had gained considerable experience in
Indonesia through its support of the government’s goals for greater participation in
development, more effective governance, and improved poverty alleviation programs.
The three KDP and the three UPP projects had worked effectively with local level
institutions and communities and demonstrated that participatory approaches can work in
Indonesia on a large scale, and that CDD projects can meet high standards of quality and
accountability. The Bank was uniquely positioned to work with the GOI to develop and
institutionalize the PNPM framework because it (i) had a number of years of experience
supporting the implementation of the KDP and UPP projects; (ii) was ready and able to
mobilize the necessary technical expertise; (iii) could offer an early intervention in the
form of additional financing to assist with program development; (iv) had effective
mechanisms in place to provide quality supervision and offer implementation support,
including results monitoring & evaluation, quality control, and beneficiary targeting; and
(v) had the capacity to assist the government in pooling the support of donors.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The overall objective of PNPM Rural 1&2 is to reduce poverty and improve local-level
governance in rural areas of Indonesia through the provision of investment resources to
support productive proposals developed by communities, using a participatory planning
process.

Key performance indicators for the PDO level of PNPM-Rural 1&2 listed in the PAD
include:
• Improved household expenditure rates and improved access to economic and social
    services in a minimum of 2,500 poor sub-districts in 2008; min. of 4,000 sub-districts
    in 2009.
•   EIRR >30% for major rural infrastructure types in PNPM sub-districts.
•   Through the PNPM-Generasi CCT pilot, improved health and education indicators in
    130 sub-district in 5 provinces:
           o Health: immunization coverage for 12 - 23 month olds increased from
             38% in 2005 to 48% in 2010.
           o Prenatal care visits increased from 56% in 2005 to 66% in 2010.
           o Deliveries assisted by trained professionals increase from 40% in 2005 to
             50% in 2010.
           o Education: increased primary school enrollment rates from 96.5% in 2005
             to 97% in 2010.
           o Increased junior high school enrollment rates from an average of 57% in
             2006 to 72% in 2010.


                                            3
•   >80% satisfaction levels from beneficiaries regarding improved services and local
    level governance.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority), Key Indicators,
and reasons/justifications
The PDO was not revised but one of the PDO key indicators was revised in May 2009
when the additional financing (AF) was approved and the original financing agreement
was amended: the target for “participating sub-districts in 2009? was increased by more
than 50% – from 2,600 to 4,000. The additional financing was mainly provided to expand
the project scope to all rural sub-districts in Indonesia. The AF approval was essentially a
restructuring of the project because it extended the closing date, revised some of the PDO
indicators and added substantial new financing.

The PAD shows five PDO education and health-related indicators, specifically for the
Generasi sub-component of the project, as listed above in section 1.2. These indicators
were designed using survey data from the National Statistics Agency (BPS) for the
baseline values of the Results Framework, pending completion of the actual Generasi
baseline survey. The baseline survey was completed in August 2007 and the baseline
values were then used in the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) for project monitoring
purposes. However there was no formal revision of the baseline data for these PDO
indicators which could have been undertaken at the time of the Additional Financing.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The main beneficiaries of the project and its various special programs and pilots were:
• People in rural areas with poor infrastructure services.
• People in rural areas with poor economic and social services, especially mothers,
    infants and school children.
• Women and the poor who were left out of planning processes.
• Selected community members who received training and acquired experience in sub-
    project planning and implementation.
• Local government staff and consultants (facilitators), who were trained in
    participatory planning and development, and in transparent and accountable
    implementation of infrastructure sub-projects.
• Students who had difficulties accessing primary or junior secondary education.

1.5 Original Components
The funding allocations by project components shown below include government
financing, and they are for the entire PNPM Rural 1&2, i.e. including the additional
financing loan (see Section 1.7 below).

Component 1: Block Grants (US$1,627.8 million). The provision of block grants to
sub-districts and villages was the main function of the PNPM-Rural 1&2. They
represented approximately 85% of the total project costs. Two types of block grants were
used: (i) grants that financed investment proposals which had been made by villages and
selected by consensus in an inter-village meeting; and (ii) grants that supported the
participatory planning process, and community training at village and sub-district levels.


                                             4
The types of block grants are described in more detail below:

a. Investment Grants (US$1,553.3 million). This sub-component delivered block grants to
about 2,600 sub-districts. Aside from a limited negative list of activities prohibited by the
GOI and / or Bank policy, there was an open menu. There were also a number of special
programs that could be funded using the block grants provided that certain procedural
changes to the standard PNPM-Rural operational manual were followed. These programs
included : (i) response to natural disasters and post-conflict situations where an
accelerated planning and disbursement cycle was allowed; and (ii) supporting the PNPM
Generasi Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) pilot program that aimed to improve MDG
indicators for poverty reduction, education and health in approximately 160 sub-districts.

b. Planning grants (US$74.5 million). Sub-district planning grants supported the village
and sub-district planning process; it allowed the communities to choose and train a team
of self-selected social and technical facilitators. Other activities funded through these
grants included village cross-audits, dissemination materials, and the cost of local travel.

Component 2: Facilitation and Training (US$137.7 million). This component funded
salaries and operational costs for the sub-district technical and social facilitators, who
were appointed as consultants. It also included activities to strengthen the newly formed
and elected local government councils and leaders (under the Decentralization Laws 22
and 25 passed in 2004, and revised as Law 31 in 2006). Activities had a special focus on
village and sub-district forums, village and sub-district executives, and district
parliaments. This component financed trainers, workshops, relevant training and
communication materials, and quality reviews of the projects.

Component 3: Implementation Support and Technical Assistance (US$71.4 million).
This component funded the formal project administration at three levels, i.e. national,
provincial and district. It included the costs of experienced technical and social
facilitators to provide technical advice, field oversight, and local-level coordination.

This component covered the costs of training, workshops, and materials for all PNPM-
Rural consultants. It also included the costs of the PNPM Rural 1&2 monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) program, including quantitative and qualitative monitoring, and
internal as well as outsourced evaluations. The additional financing was used to
strengthen the internal systems through better technology, additional training, and
improved oversight. Approximately 3.5% of project funds were allocated for M&E.

Lastly, the component also included an enhanced audit program with expanded sampling
and capacity development support for district government auditors. This additional
activity was based on research findings and introduced best practice recommendations,
for example exit briefings to community and local government members and increased
sample coverage.




                                             5
Component 4: Support for Project Management (US$22.6 million): This component
covered critical national-level activities needed to manage the program: introducing
electronic file management for PMD; office improvements; and the provision of 15 – 20
national and international scholarships to provide advanced specialized training in
management, key staff evaluation, and fiduciary controls.

1.6 Revised Components
The project components were not revised, but their scope was expanded and costs and
financing increased, as explained in Section 1.7.

1.7 Other significant changes
The following changes took place in the course of project implementation:
•   In June 2008 the original US$41.19 million loan was converted from a fixed rate to a
    variable rate loan, a new loan number was assigned and a new loan agreement was
    executed.
•   In May 2009 additional loan financing of US$300 million was approved. This
    brought total Bank financing for PNPM-Rural 1&2 to US$531.19 million. The
    additional loan was to finance the full scale-up of the project to (i) provide
    supplemental block grants to the 2,864 sub-districts covered under the original
    financing, and (ii) expand coverage to an additional 1,507 rural sub-districts.
•   In tandem with the approval of the additional loan, the financing agreement for the
    original loan and credit was amended as follows:
           o The target of the performance indicator “Participating Kecamatan? was
             increased from 2,600 to 4,000 participating sub-districts for 2009 and
             2010.
           o The closing date of the original loan and credit was extended by six
             months to December 31, 2011, i.e. the same closing date as the additional
             loan.
           o Some modifications and clarifications to procurement arrangements were
             made.

There were no formal changes made to the PDO or to the basic design of the original
project. However GOI agreed to Bank recommendations made in the January 2009 aide-
mémoire that proposed to enhance oversight arrangements to ensure that fiduciary and
other aspects would be adequately supported and supervised under the expanded project
scope, e.g. increase of BPKP audit samples, training of local auditors, and mobilization of
financial facilitators.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Lessons Applied. KDP had been a constantly evolving program that had provided many
useful lessons for the design of PNPM-Rural. The following valuable key lessons were
incorporated into the project:
•   As demonstrated by KDP, CDD projects provide a robust architecture for innovative,
    mainly donor-supported ways to tackle poverty, social problems, and post-disaster
    situations. A number of innovative pilot programs were started by PNPM-Rural.
•   Several KDP studies highlighted the critical importance of high-quality training for
    facilitators. Adequate training resources were budgeted during appraisal.
•   A controlled experiment by KDP showed that losses caused by corruption and poor
    management can be reduced significantly by increasing the likelihood of audits, and
    most importantly, by immediately publicizing results from the audits in local
    meetings. PNPM-Rural’s overall audit arrangements aimed to almost triple audit
    samples over KDP levels.

Risks and their Mitigation. The overall risk assessment for the project underestimated
the risks. The PAD rated the risks as “moderate? – after applying mitigation measures –
although appraisal had identified four “high? and another four “substantial? risks: (i)
inadequate central and local government funding, (ii) late budget releases by the central
government, (iii) slow or improper procurement of consultants, and (iv) weak capacity of
FM staff at PIU as well as at UPK level. These were among the most important risks;
they were considered to be common in CDD projects in Indonesia and amenable to
mitigation. The reduced risk rating was based on PNPM adopting the design of previous
KDP operations that had accumulated eight years of implementation experience. The
mitigation measures that were incorporated into PNPM were built on lessons learned
from UPP2 and UPP3, and from KDP-3B.

KDP and PNPM-Rural. Even though most operating procedures and regulations were
kept the same as for KDP, the transition to PNPM-Rural was more than just a name
change. The project scope was greatly expanded to cover the rural areas of the entire
country by 2009. There were larger block grants, especially for poor sub-districts, with
much more GOI buy-in, financing and ownership. There was a conscious and explicit
link to the twin goals of poverty alleviation and empowerment. This is evident in the very
strong and public support for the use of facilitators from the private and non-government
sectors, and not just village facilitators. With PNPM-Rural, more high-level central
government involvement and oversight were expected.

Donor Support and Partnerships. The Decentralization Support Facility (DSF), a multi-
donor trust fund (TF) managed by the Bank, supported the GOI with the preparation of
the initial PNPM-Rural project, providing close to US$4 million in assistance. Later, in
2007, the PNPM Support Facility (PSF), a multi-donor Trust Fund co-chaired by the GOI
and by the World Bank, was established to assist the GOI in providing effective



                                            7
leadership and management for PNPM. The PSF enabled the GOI to access a range of
donor programs and resources to support poverty alleviation through the PNPM. By 2011,
the GOI, the PSF Secretariat/World Bank and NGOs were responsible for the
implementation of 28 projects and activities valued at US$187 million.3 At the time of
writing, PSF members include the GOI, AusAID, DANIDA, UKAID, the Netherlands,
EU and USAID. Other donors that contribute to Indonesia’s cluster of PNPM Programs
but that are not members of PSF include CIDA, ADB, and JICA.

Donor assistance through grants has been especially helpful for initiating evaluations and
for piloting innovations. Donors also provided special assistance for working in difficult
areas, such as Aceh, Nias and the two Papua provinces.

2.2 Implementation
After the loan became effective in July 2008, disbursement started off slowly in 2008 due
to the late release – in October only – of the revised central budget. Nevertheless, funds
which were still available from the previous KDP3 loan and from GOI’s own funding
ensured that no significant disruption occurred to the program implementation prior to the
disbursement of the new PNPM loan. Procurement of consultant firms was delayed and
some facilitator positions were not filled. The full scale up in 2009 saw continued support
from local government despite the increase of funding they had to provide. Many district
governments contributed up to 20% of block grant funding.

By early 2009, difficulties were reported with coordinating and harmonizing the various
PNPM pilots. During the first half of 2009 a large supervision mission was conducted
that carried out the tasks usually performed by a mid-term review (MTR) mission: the
first-year sub-projects were assessed to be generally of good technical quality (despite the
problems and delays encountered during 2008) and about 80% of the consultants /
facilitators positions had been filled. However, the program still had a shortage of
technical and financial specialist facilitators, and pre-service and refresher training of
facilitators was behind schedule. Village level planning was also inefficient and did not
make use of multi-year plans and previously agreed priority projects. This was in part due
to inadequate facilitation and community training. The budget release of block grants was
late again 4, and procurement was assessed as weak, including at the community level
where a lack of transparency and efficiency was observed. Funding of microfinance
activities through women’s savings and loan groups (SPP) were increasing because up to
25% of block grants could be used for such activities. Although the sub-district financial
management units (UPK) were reported to be mostly coping with these increased
activities, instances of insufficient oversight and lack of transparency at the village level
were observed. The complaints handling system was working but follow-up and
resolution of cases was not sufficiently prompt. The program’s management information

    Late central budget releases are common in Indonesia and affect the entire lending portfolio.

system (MIS) run by the National Management Consultant (NMC) failed to perform
properly due to a lack of adequate design, equipment, staff and management.

Bank supervision in mid-2010 found that many of the problems and challenges
encountered during 2008 and 2009 had still not been adequately addressed. This was of
special concern because the implementation of PNPM Rural 3 was just starting and a
PNPM Rural 4 loan was being discussed with the GOI. Bank supervision, while
acknowledging the challenges of such a large project, found serious problems, and
suggested that implementation performance (IP) be rated as “unsatisfactory?. A number
of urgent actions were recommended by the Bank to address the following:
•   there are good reasons to believe that fraud and corruption in PNPM is likely to be
    much lower than in other government programs because of an effective fiduciary
    control system and community management, but comprehensive comparisons
    between programs are difficult, 5
•   difficulties to fill empty facilitator positions,
•   failure to equip, staff and manage an effective MIS,
•   delayed or incomplete reporting (in part due to complex requirements),
•   inadequate field oversight by national, provincial & district management consultants,
    and
•   serious performance problems within the NMC.

Subsequently, performance improved, including timely budget release. By September
2010, 98.5 % of the loan and credit funds for this project were disbursed. During 2010
and part of 2011, unfinished sub-projects (mainly due to the late release of funds) were
completed. District.

PNPM-Generasi . The PNPM-Generasi pilot started in mid-2007 with bilateral funding
from the Netherlands in rural areas of five Indonesian provinces selected by the
government: West Java, East Java, North Sulawesi, Gorontalo, and Nusa Tenggara Timur,
using PNPM Rural as a platform. PMD was the implementing agency. By the end of
2007, PNPM-Generasi covered 1,697 villages in 129 sub-districts, with a total budget of
about US$14 million. By 2009, PNPM-Generasi covered just over 2,000 villages in 164
sub-districts in the same five provinces with a total annual budget of US$35.7 million.

  BPKP Annual Audit reports consistently estimated deviations in village subprojects in PNPM are
between 0.1% - 0.2%. Previous Independent audits of KDP performed by Moores Rowland (2005) found
that less than 1% of village subprojects showed deviations. Procurement Post and Financial Review by
Price Waterhouse (June 2006) conclude that 3.31% of village subprojects showed deviations.




                                                 9
Co-financing. When the additional financing for PNPM-Rural was being discussed
between the GOI and the Bank during 2008, there was still a financing gap for the
expanded PNPM implementation. In November 2008 The International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD) agreed with the GOI to provide a loan of SDR 42.03
million (equivalent US$66 million) plus a TA grant of SDR 0.25 million (equivalent
US$ 0.4 million) for a co-financing operation that is directly linked to PNPM-Rural 1&2,
with the Bank named in the project financing agreement as “cooperating institution? to
“administer? the loan and grant. By December 2011 about 70% of the IFAD loan had
been disbursed. The closing date for the IFAD loan and grant is September 30, 2016.
Therefore the loan and grant are not covered by this ICR.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Design. The M&E framework was well designed to inform as well as improve the
operations and strategic directions of PNPM. The GOI had set up two working groups to
focus on suitable indicators for MIS and reporting, respectively. The M&E was a
comprehensive system relying on internal (by participating communities and the
consultants) and external (auditors and independent local NGOs) monitoring.

The M&E framework also provided for rigorous evaluations. While these were not
financed from the proceeds of the Loans and Credit covered in this ICR, they provided
information on the Key Performance Indicators listed in the PAD. 6 These include:
•    PNPM-Rural Impact Evaluation. The research methodology was designed to ensure
    the impacts found can be attributed to the program. A propensity score-matching
    approach was used to select sub-districts participating in PNPM beginning in 2007
    and a control sub-district group that has similar characteristics, who began
    participation in 2009/2010. The sample consisted of 6,319 households and 26,811
    households respectively from 300 sub-districts across 17 provinces. Qualitative
    studies were also conducted in eighteen villages in 3 provinces in 2007 and 2010 to
    enhance understanding of the findings from the quantitative analysis. This enabled
    the evaluation to conduct difference-in-differences estimates of the impact of PNPM
    on a set of six groups of indicators related to (i) real per capita consumption; (ii)
    poverty status; (iii) use of outpatient health services; (iv) unemployment rate; (v)
    primary and secondary enrollment rates; and (vi) measures of social dynamics and
    governance.
•   PNPM-Generasi Impact Evaluation. A three-wave impact evaluation of the PNPM-
    Generasi pilot was conducted. The evaluation incorporated randomization in the
    selection of treatment and control sub-districts. The baseline survey was completed in
    August, 2007, with the mid-line and end-line surveys completed in December, 2008
    and December, 2009, respectively.

Implementation. The project management information system (MIS) that was maintained
by the NMC did not have a very robust design and became quickly overwhelmed by the
rapid scaling up of the project scope. In 2010 Bank supervision found that the MIS was
“not functioning properly, and that reporting was unreliable, late and often useless?. Key
staff positions were still empty, required equipment was not available or was not being
used. As a result, monitoring quality had declined over the course of the project and
reliable monitoring results were often not available. Direct field supervision by the
implementing agency was also less frequent than necessary and not well planned nor
risk-based.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Environment. As a Category B project, the only environmental safeguard policy
triggered was OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment (EA). In order to deal with
environmental impacts for a CDD project, an Environmental Management Framework
was adopted to maximize the benefits of the projects and mitigate, offset, or eliminate,
any adverse environmental impacts. These goals were to be achieved mainly by the
“environmental checklist? procedure during sub-project identification, design and
implementation. The checklist was supplemented by a negative list of certain types of
sub-projects that could have serious negative impacts on the environment, such as
activities within protected areas, alterations of a river course, mining of live coral, large
land reclamation sub-projects or large new irrigation schemes. This approach was based
on the experience with the earlier KDP projects, where no serious adverse environmental
impacts were reported. Initially, there was little, if any, environmental supervision but
the May 2008 supervision reported that there were “no serious safeguards issues but there
are no environmental reports available for this project?. Subsequently, the September
2010 supervision report records that “supervision of safeguards had been greatly
increased and improved over the last six months?; it was also reported that supervision,
monitoring and media reporting had never found any serious or systematic problems 7. In
June 2011 new Implementation Guidelines for Social and Environmental Safeguards
were issued as a supplement to the PNPM Operations Manual.

Social safeguards, including land acquisition. For social aspects, the project triggered
OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples (IP) and OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement. Therefore,
the project had adopted a Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework and also an
Indigenous People and Isolated Vulnerable People Development Framework to mitigate
adverse economic, social, or cultural impacts by the implementation of sub-projects,
especially on IPs. PNPM has followed the principles of participation, consultation, and
empowerment of local communities to ensure that indigenous vulnerable groups
participate actively in the project. Past experience from KDP projects showed that there
are few, if any, social safeguards issues in this type of project. Initially, there was little, if

 A Technical Evaluation in three sample provinces conducted in March/April 2012 inspected 420 sub-
projects in 39 sub-districts (about 200 villages) and found that 81% were rated as “sufficient? for
environmental aspects; 16% were rated “slightly below sufficient?. Only 3% of sub-projects were rated
“below specifications? because they showed serious environmental problems.



                                                 11
any, social safeguards supervision: the May 2008 aide-mémoire report stated that there
were no serious safeguards issues, but the September 2010 aide-mémoire noted that
“there is a lack of good records on land acquisition and voluntary land donations related
to sub-projects.? Safeguards supervision improved later on during project implementation

Procurement. The bulk of the procurement under the Project was community
procurement of construction material under the block grants, comprising a large number
of small value contracts (approx 40,000 contracts annually, ranging from US$ 5,000 to
37,000 per contract). Procurement procedures for community procurement and oversight
arrangements were specified in the Project Operations Manual. As is the case with most
CDD projects, the large number and dispersed nature of the contracts, weak procurement
capacity at the village level, and the broader governance issues associated with
procurement, however, posed a challenge in providing the desired level of assurance of
effective procurement compliance. Efforts were made to strengthen the procurement
procedures and oversight arrangements. Village procurement procedures were revised,
improved and became a separate Annex 12 of the Project manual (PTO). The NMC
developed a Standard Operational Procedure for Internal Audit to be used by district
facilitators and provincial supervisors. PMD also created a new position of financial
management facilitator at the district level. Procurement at national level was mainly for
consultants / facilitators, either through consultant companies or contracted as individuals,
and for workshops and training events; the latter were treated as “non –consulting
services? as it was expected that these could be processed more quickly than consulting
services.

In 2009, the Bank provided a procurement advisor to PMD to assist and accelerate the
processing of contracts. PMD chose not to use the services of this advisor, and also
mentioned that some of the problems and delays were caused by English-language Bank
documents. The main problem appeared to be the heavy workload of PMD which had
become stretched by the rapid scale-up of the program.

Financial management (FM). Financial management was negatively affected by a lack
of sufficient and timely training of facilitators and UPK staff, and by September 2010, the
performance of about 30% of the UPK were found to be less than satisfactory. Following
independent research and as agreed at appraisal, the central government audit agency
(BPKP) had increased the number of sub-districts audited. For FY 2008 and 2009 audits,
a total of 1,335 audit findings were issued, of which 725 (54%) have been resolved; 192


                                             12
findings are still being processed, and for 455 findings no specific report had been
issued 8. The findings dealt with a variety of problems, such as violations of principles
and procedures, irregularities, diversion and abuse of funds, and also interventions by the
village elite. In 2011, BPKP had carried out on-site audits of about 20% of all sub-
districts in 31 provinces and 243 districts and 880 sub-districts; this was done for FY
2010 activities. Many cases involved revolving fund activities (RLF) and it remains a
challenge for the next PNPM Program. Provision of FM consultant in each kabupaten
level improved the quality of financial management performance. The increase in audit
coverage was also introduced to improve accountability at the community level.

Complaints handling and anti-corruption action plan. Overall, the complaints handling
system, supplemented by the increasing coverage of the BPKP audits, was effective in
uncovering problems, such as fraud, diversion of funds, violation of procedures and
abuse of authority. The KDP / PNPM program has clearly been very proactive and
innovative in fighting corruption in all its forms. Only 0.3% of total block grants are
known to be affected by fraud and corruption. Of this amount, 57% has been recovered
and returned to communities, and 43% remains under litigation. While a majority of
cases of fraud and theft are solved at the community level, a total of 262 cases have gone
through the legal system. Beyond the recovery of stolen assets, perpetrators were held to
account: about 80 people, including facilitators, government officials and community
members, received jail sentences, and about 300 facilitators (about 3% of all facilitators
working on PNPM 1&2) were dismissed because of fraud or misconduct.

When implementation of PNPM-Rural 1&2 started, there was still a backlog of difficult
cases. Since 2010, with pressure from senior management and leadership from Bappenas,
the Bank used a tougher regime of sanctions that proved to be effective: two provinces,
and twelve out of some 340 districts had disbursements suspended, and reimbursement
for 134 out of approximately 4,000 sub-districts were rejected because of unresolved
cases.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Handing over of sub-projects and Maintenance. Sub-projects were handed over to the
villages immediately after completion as part of the normal project cycle. When
communities were close to the completion of the works, an operations and maintenance
(O&M) meeting was organized by the facilitator, and an O&M committee was formed.
This committee was often comprised of the same members as the implementation
committee. For revenue-generating facilities, such as water supply, markets, and
irrigation, a village-level utility was set up to manage funds and O&M activities. While
efforts were made at the village level to establish adequate O&M capacities, especially
for roads (the most popular infrastructure investment and also the most difficult and
costly to maintain with community resources alone), no formal institutional arrangements
were made at the district level, nor were there any district level budget provisions for

  The lack of a specific report following a finding may be due to a number of reasons such as
recommendations that were not finalized, inconclusive reports, or lack of follow-up.



                                             13
ongoing maintenance and repairs 9. In contrast, a 2009 review of KDP/PNPM community
water supply systems showed that, generally, water project maintenance is good, and
technical and financial capacities, paired with the village communities’ willingness to
perform O&M, are adequate to keep such systems going. The main problems uncovered
by that review related to poor design and construction. The 2012 Technical Evaluation
also rated maintenance of infrastructure built under the project. The level and quality of
maintenance is uneven. It is considerably better for infrastructure that provides direct
services for the community, such as water supply, electricity supply systems and bridges.
Sanitary facilities and roads (likely for the reasons discussed above) show a much lower
percentage of sub-projects rated as “sufficient? in terms of maintenance.

Follow-on Projects. As PNPM is a government program, the next phases are being
implemented, i.e. PNPM-Rural 3 and PNPM-Rural 4 are progressing well and applying
the lessons that have been drawn, on ongoing basis, from PNPM-Rural 1&2. Also, as of
June 2012, PNPM-Rural 5 is being prepared. The continuing rolling series of PNPM
program interventions will assure ongoing improvements in rural infrastructure, thereby
contributing to poverty alleviation, community empowerment, and improvements in local
level governance, as new investments and outputs keep building on previous projects. In
2010 an Additional Financing Grant was made effective to channel commitments of up to
US$105 million to support the scale-up of PNPM-Generasi to 500 sub-districts over the
period 2010-14.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Since adopting PNPM as the national program for poverty alleviation in 2006, the GOI
has been committed fully to the program. It was approved by the national parliament and
formally announced by the president; relevant policies and regulations have been issued
by the GOI to make PNPM an ongoing government program. Funding contributions from
the national and the local governments to the PNPM-Rural program have been increasing
year by year, and by 2012, the GOI was discussing with the Bank the financing for
PNPM-5. Together with continuing PNPM-Rural as an annual program, the GOI seeks to
further improve its performance and enhance it with special initiatives and pilots – a clear
indication of the GOI’s current commitment and priorities. Other countries within and
outside the Region are keenly interested in PNPM-Rural, and there are frequent visits by
foreign delegations to learn from PNPM experience.

PNPM’s overall development objectives were poverty reduction, and improving local
governance and service delivery in rural and urban areas in Indonesia. The current


9A study, Village Capacity in Maintaining Infrastructure: Evidence from Rural Indonesia. World Bank.
November 2010, found that there is very limited financial capacity at the village level forperiodic road
maintenance.

Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 2009 – 12 emphasizes engagements with
government counterparts and other stakeholders who are committed to addressing critical
governance and institutional challenges. This approach aims to (i) improve existing
government programs, (ii) strengthen the institutions involved, both state and non-state,
and, (iii) encourage others to replicate them. In addition to its cross-cutting engagements
to strengthen central and sub-national government institutions and systems, the CPS
identified five thematic areas that are expected to form the core of the World Bank
Group’s engagement: (i) Private Sector Development; (ii) Infrastructure; (iii) Community
Development and Social Protection; (iv) Education; and (v) Environmental Sustainability
and Disaster Mitigation. PNPM-Rural supports both the approach suggested under the
CPS as well as thematic areas of engagement for Infrastructure and Community
Development and Social Protection. Indeed, the PNPM program is the Bank’s operational
centerpiece for the core engagement area of community development.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The PDO have largely been achieved in the three main areas targeted: 10
(a)     Poverty alleviation: This objective has been achieved as evidenced by the
2009/10 PNPM Impact Evaluation which showed increased per capita household
consumption of about 9% on average in PNPM areas and consumption increases of 19%
in the poorest 20% of the sub-districts.
(b)    Local level governance: Governance has improved, especially through the
consistent use of participatory planning processes, followed by community involvement
and monitoring during implementation. However, recent evaluation studies showed that
the local level governance improvements happened within the project only, and no
impacts could be measured on general village governance.
(c)      Investments in Community Infrastructure and Micro-credits: Access to
economic and social services has improved significantly and the revised coverage target
of 4,000 sub-districts has been exceeded by almost 10%. Almost 50,000 infrastructure
sub-projects were completed, about 10,000 education-related and 5,000 health-related
activities were implemented, and approximately 30,000 microcredit groups were funded.
(d)     Satisfaction Levels: Project monitoring reports indicated high satisfaction levels
from beneficiaries, and the preliminary results 11 of ongoing 2012 Technical Evaluation
confirmed high satisfaction levels of beneficiaries regarding functionality and utilization
of infrastructure: 65% of beneficiaries surveyed rated functionality and utilization as
High and 24% rated them as Average.




10
  It should be noted that the results described in this section are not exclusively attributable to PNPM 1&2,
but also to the successor and overlapping PNPM 3 Loan.

11
  By May 2012, results were available for three provinces, i.e. Central Java, West Kalimantan and West
Sulawesi. About 420 sub-projects in some 200 villages, in 39 sub-districts were inspected and rated for
various aspects of quality.



                                                    15
(e)     Economic Rate of Return: A small replication of the 2004/5 12 EIRR study was
carried out, in the second quarter of 2012, in 4 provinces for almost 50 infrastructure
projects. Results of this replication suggest rates of return of between 35 and 75% for
recent road/bridge, irrigation/drainage, or clean water supply sub-projects.
(f)     Education and Health: The PNPM-Generasi Impact Evaluation, published in
June 2011, showed that PNPM 1&2 achieved its health-related PDO indicators.
Specifically, the program saw increases of 10-11% in immunization coverage for 12-23
month-olds, in prenatal care visits, and in deliveries assisted by trained professionals
relative to baseline values. PNPM-Generasi achieved one of the two education-related
indicators: Junior secondary school enrollment rates increased by 14 percentage points to
achieve the target value of 72% in treatment areas. By contrast, primary school
enrollment rates increased by only 3.5 percentage points from the baseline value of 88%.
The Impact Evaluation shows that over the 30-month evaluation period childhood
malnutrition (weight-for-age of children under three) was reduced by 2.2 percentage
points, about a 10% reduction from the control level. This reduction in malnutrition was
strongest in areas with a higher malnutrition rate prior to project implementation, most
notably in the Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) province, where underweight rates were
reduced by 8.8 percentage points, a 20% decline compared to control areas; severe
underweight rates were reduced by 5.5 percentage points, a 33% decline. Severe stunting
of infants was reduced by 6.6 percentage points, a 21% decline compared to control areas.
Education impacts were also largest in the NTT province, where junior secondary school
gross enrollment rates increased by 18 percentage points, or 29% relative to controls.
These findings show that PNPM-Generasi was most effective in areas with low baseline
health and educational performance. 13

Overall Achievements of PDO. The overall rate of achievement of PDO is satisfactory.
The project moved millions of people above the poverty line, and saved children’s lives
by reducing the incidence of malnutrition. Intermediate outcome indicators for quality,
participation, completion of work plans, functioning of O&M, and deployment of
consultants, have been achieved or exceeded. At the same time, the project fell short of
expectations with regard to improvements to local level governance.

and contributed to these achievements.

3.3 Efficiency
The 2012 PNPM-Rural impact evaluation 14 found that the recorded 9% growth in per
capita consumption rates of PNPM households represents a significant return on project
investment. Using a conservative estimate of 5.3% growth from the matched household
sample, the yearly impact is 3.3 times the amount of the block grants invested. Greater
efficiency was achieved through the use of village labor and construction management as
compared to the costs of similar, contractor-built infrastructure. Least-cost prices were
achieved by the standard PNPM program requirement that for larger goods items,
villages had to obtain competitive quotes from three suppliers. On average, past studies
had shown that community-implemented KDP infrastructure projects cost 30 to 50% less
than those executed by contractors. Results from the ongoing Technical Evaluation
suggest similar savings for recently built PNPM sub-projects: savings over contractor-
supplied infrastructure of between 35 to 40% were common.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The project was and remains highly relevant for the Borrower and the Bank and has
largely achieved its PDO, and even exceeded some important targets, such as coverage of
sub-districts and rate of annual audits that were performed. Beneficiaries’ satisfaction
levels with functionality and utilization of the new infrastructure was found to be “High?
by 65% and “Average? by 24% in a recent Technical Evaluation. Results from a 2004/5
study15 and a smaller-scale replication of that study in 2012 indicate economic internal
rates of return on new PNPM-financed infrastructure sub-projects of between 35 and 75%.
This high rate of return reflects the considerable time and cost savings, crop production
increases and associated benefits realized by rural people, especially in poor and remote
areas that lacked adequate infrastructure the most.

The PNPM-Generasi pilot had a statistically significant positive impact on all but one of
the Key Performance Indicators it was designed to address. The main long-term impact
was a decrease in malnutrition.

In spite of these positive results there was limited impact on improvements in overall
local governance in Indonesia. The project also struggled with a number of
implementation challenges related to long standing institutional capacity issues that,
while not specific to the implementing agency, were further exacerbated as a result of the
national scale up.

On balance, the overall outcome is rated as Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
As discussed above, consumption levels had increased on average by 9% in PNPM areas,
and PNPM had an even stronger impact on poor households, i.e. almost 19%
consumption growth in the poorest 20% of rural sub-districts in the project, and these
impacts also extend to the “near poor?. Through a special focus, PNPM also had
positive impacts for women, first by raising their participation level, (which was at
around 45% during the proposal and planning stages) ensuring that their priority needs
will be at least considered, and second, through funding of microcredit groups. Up to
25% of block grants can be allocated to women’s loan and savings groups (SPP) and
about 17% has been. In KDP mixed groups had been able to access credit but repayment
was poor and learning from that experience the program switched to women’s only
groups. However, while participation, access to information, transparency and general
governance are used to good purpose within project processes, these do not usually spill
over to other areas of village development and governance. Although women and the
poor are included in the process, the quality of participation in decision-making can still
be improved

The impact evaluation for PNPM-Generasi 16 showed that participating communities
were effective at targeting direct benefits to the poor (defined as the bottom two quintiles
of per-capita consumption), particularly those benefits delivered in kind, such as
uniforms, school supplies, and supplementary feeding. PNPM-Generasi also saw a high
level of women’s participation. From 2007 to 2009 on average 68% of participants in
program socialization, planning, and accountability meetings were women.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
Capacity has been built widely through training and on-the-job experience in three areas:
(i) village communities, mainly village facilitators and the various committee members,
such as for implementation, monitoring, and maintenance; (ii) local government level, at
the village, sub-district, district and provincial levels; and (iii) private sector consultants
who were engaged mainly as facilitators.

At the end of implementation, thousands of facilitators had been trained, about half of
whom were engineers. They are available for this or other CDD-type programs or
alternatively, they may use the skills and experience they have acquired through PNPM
(and earlier KDP projects) to work in other sectors, such as with government, in the
private sector, or with NGOs.

When people from local communities have taken on roles as village facilitators, village
planning and implementation committee (TPK) members, village monitoring team
members, or as elected UPK officers, their capacities were developed through a learning-
by-doing process. The training they received from the facilitators would have been

meaningless if these villagers had not had hands-on experience in village planning,
carrying out field surveys, facilitating village meetings, managing their own projects,
discussing implementation problems, and other related processes. In each participating
village, about 30 or more villagers were directly involved in project processes and in
training. This is in addition to the villagers who attend village meetings or work on sub-
projects, or women who receive revolving funds.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Technical facilitators who were trained in the two Papua provinces often left for other
opportunities after working for the PNPM program. In this way they are contributing
positively to overall capacity building in Papua.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Several stakeholder workshops were organized in February 2012 in Aceh and West Java.
There were about 40 – 50 participants in each workshop, representing a wide cross
section of project stakeholders (provincial, district and sub-district level government staff,
consultants / facilitators, and community members involved in implementation) and also
some beneficiaries. The main findings elaborated by the various stakeholders were
divided into several focus areas:

   •   Good governance through transparency, participation, and accountability
   •   Economy and poverty reduction
   •   Support to government systems
   •   Program design and monitoring
   •   Implementation support and facilitation for the program.

Although the findings from the workshops reflect mainly the views of project actors, it
can be concluded from the stakeholder workshops that PNPM-Rural 1&2 had positive
impacts on social accountability and transparency within the program. PNPM also
contributed to poverty alleviation, economic household welfare, and service delivery
through more cost-effective basic infrastructure of sufficient quality relative to other
approaches. Nevertheless, challenges remain with regard to the local partners’ ownership,
low spill-over of social accountability and transparency to the broader organizational
culture, and inadequate quality of facilitation for the communities concerned. The
detailed findings of the stakeholder workshops are presented in Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
The risk to the development outcome is rated as moderate. The PNPM program is well
established as it built on the experience of the earlier KDP program. This series of
projects has facilitated an ongoing learning process, with lessons being captured, and
more or less promptly, incorporated into the next cycle of investments. However, the
slow progress in institutionalizing the participatory processes throughout the operations
of local government and the continuing constraints to good O&M performance by village
committees, pose a moderate risk to the development outcome. Recent impact evaluation
studies also showed that good governance practices usually do not extend beyond PNPM
project activities. Overall, the lower risk factors (the high economic impacts of
community projects, the vigorous community engagement and ownership, the
government commitment, good governance, and institutional support) considerably
outweigh the higher risk factors (the limited technical and financial capacity for good
O&M 17). Therefore, the risk to the development outcome has been rated as moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank performed well in ensuring quality at entry. When it responded positively and
promptly to the GOI’s desire to launch a national CDD program for rural infrastructure
investments, it applied many of the lessons from the KDP series of projects, and also
ensured adequate and continuing financing for a nation-wide program. More specifically:
    • The Bank supported the GOI’s adoption of the KDP approach as the national
       community empowerment program for poverty alleviation,
    • The project and its design were highly relevant to the Bank and the GOI priorities,
    • Preparation staff did a good job of incorporating the many lessons from the KDP,
    • Risks were correctly identified, and mitigation actions were proposed but they
       proved to be somewhat inadequate for the rapid and massive scaling up,
    • The Bank was able to mobilize considerable donor grant resources to expand the
       project scope through innovative pilot programs that addressed special needs,
       such as education and health, environmental issues, and special development
       needs in Papua, and
    • The Bank used donor support to establish the PNPM support facility, using a
       multi-donor trust fund that provided additional resources for implementation
       support.

                                                 20
However, the risk assessment by the Bank underestimated the challenges of a rapid
scaling up which further amplified well known implementation challenges that are
prevalent across public institutions in Indonesia (such as late budget release or delays in
procurement).

On balance, the Bank performance has been rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
During supervision, Bank staff made great efforts to deal with the challenges of
implementing a large CDD project, such as wide geographic coverage, late fund releases
by government, and difficulties hiring and training of sufficient facilitators. They also
aimed to address the challenges of the rapid scale-up:
    • Bank staff showed great initiative in mobilizing substantive trust funds resources,
       allowing the Bank to allocate substantially more (up to US$ 400,000 per year) to
       implementation support than is the case for the supervision of other Loans,
    • Beyond the formal supervision missions that were carried out twice per year,
       starting in 2011 PSF mobilized a team of field implementation specialists and
       fiduciary staff to provide additional implementation support,
    • Additional financing was arranged quickly for a second year of implementation
       which allowed full scaling up and continuation of the program for another full
       year,
    • An additional financing gap was covered by mobilizing a co-financing loan by
       IFAD,
    • Bank supervision and implementation support were ample and adequate.
       Implementation challenges and problems were promptly identified and useful
       recommendations for addressing them were made,
    • The Bank was persistent in pushing for earlier budget releases,
    • A considerable number of monitoring and impact evaluation studies were carried
       out and brought valuable insights and findings for improving design and
       implementation, and
    • Tougher sanctions were applied for fraud and corruption cases, such as
       suspension of disbursements in two provinces and rejection of reimbursement
       requests.

However there were also a number of shortfalls:
  • Despite the intensive supervision, the Bank did not succeed in helping PMD
     overcome the many implementation challenges,
  • Reporting of progress, ratings and impacts and monitoring results was neglected
     and at times late- the ISR was not updated for 18 months at one stage,
  • The Bank was not fully able to coordinate and harmonize the various initiatives
     and pilots that were being implemented on the PNPM platform, and
  • During the first two years of project implementation, there were gaps in
     supervision because of delays in filling senior staff positions overseeing the task
     team and insufficient attention by the Bank to implementation problems identified
     in supervision reports.


                                            21
Overall, the quality of the Bank’s supervision has been rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Based on the ratings for the quality at entry and the quality of supervision, overall Bank
performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The ggovernment performed well, especially when it committed to national coverage and
mobilized the necessary funding for it, specifically the large local government
contribution. The GOI also improved its performance with timely budget releases in the
later stages of implementation. More specifically:
• The GOI had the vision to embark on a national community empowerment program
    to support its poverty alleviation goals.
• The government was able to mobilize very significant additional financial resources
    to contribute to the program.
• The central government succeeded in motivating local governments to contribute at
    least 25% to PNPM block grants from the provincial and district budgets.
• The GOI also developed policy and associated regulations to firmly establish PNPM
    within the government system.
• The government audit agency (BPKP) increased the audit coverage to about 20% of
    all sub-districts.

However, the GOI was not able to fully address the challenges of the rapid scaling up,
faced especially by PMD, the implementing agency:
• Although budgets were released late in 2008 and 2009, by 2010 the budgets were
    released on time with positive impacts on the quality of implementation.
• The government failed to anticipate the need for greater operational and institutional
    support during the scaling up of the program and did not provide the necessary
    staffing resources to PMD.

On balance, the government’s performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
In spite of many challenges, PMD, the implementing agency, was able to successfully
bring Indonesia’s flagship community empowerment program to a national scale less
than three years after its initial launch. This was all the more impressive since, beyond
the efforts supported by PNPM-Rural 1&2, PMD was also responsible for a number of
related programs that contributed to Indonesia’s overall PNPM Program. In addition,
PMD was willing to enhance project outcomes through innovative initiatives and pilot
programs.



                                           22
However there were also a number of implementation challenges which to a large extent
were due to the massive workload for PMD. These included:

•   Slow procurement of consultants, services and goods.
•   Late recruitment and training of facilitators. Up to 20% of facilitators positions,
    especially for financial and technical specialists, remained vacant.
•   The national management consultant (NMC) failed to provide adequate field
    oversight. Reporting by the NMC was often late and of poor quality.
•   The management information system (MIS) performed poorly and could not be fully
    used to measure monitoring implementation progress and results.
•   Complaints and corruption cases were not always dealt with promptly.
•   Corrective aactions identified by supervision missions, were not always acted upon
    by PMD in a timely fashion.
•   Senior PMD management failed to anticipate the need for greater operational and
    institutional support during the scaling up of the program.

On balance, the Implementing Agency’s performance has been rated as Moderately
Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Given that both the Government performance and the Implementing Agency are rated as
Moderately Satisfactory, the overall outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

•   Adoption and funding by the government: A popular and robust series of Bank-led
    projects with demonstrated success in rural poverty reduction and improved
    governance, can lead to a massive national program led and largely funded by the
    Government. It can also mobilize significantly increased counterpart funding, at
    national and local levels, to achieve country-wide coverage.
•   The Use of a Multidonor Trust Fund Improved implementation and successful
    experimentation: A successful series of projects, thoroughly evaluated, documented
    and publicized, can attract bilateral donors through linked trust funds and parallel
    financing operations. IFAD co-financed the project with a loan and a small grant, and
    Australia, Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, the United States and the European Union
    supported the project with individual and multi-donor trust funds to finance
    innovative initiatives and pilot programs using the PNPM platform. A large complex
    project, with many pilots and initiatives, like PNPM, cannot be successfully
    supervised and supported only by regular Bank supervision budgets, especially as the
    government relied on the Bank to provide specialized implementation support.
    Enhanced supervision and implementation support was funded by multi-donor grants,
    some of which were channeled as trust funds through the PSF. Accessing and
    maintaining donor support through partnerships is essential for adequate




                                           23
    implementation support of complex and large operations with thousands of sub-
    projects.
•   Rapid and large scaling up of a program’s operation can exceed institutional
    capacity: In PNPM-Rural 1&2, the major expansion of the scope and scale of the
    project following its adoption as a national program, put severe stress on the
    institutional capacities at the national level, especially PMD and for the NMC. The
    rapid program expansion also caused serious problems with data collection and the
    management and capacity of the MIS. Such challenges should be anticipated and
    addressed in project design although “system problems? are more difficult to deal
    with (see below).
•   Dealing with “system problems?: A number of implementation problems (the
    timely mobilization and training of enough capable consultants / facilitators, on-time
    and compliant procurement, good financial management) have recurred in every
    operation of this type and are rather “system problems? that affect not just the KDP /
    PNPM program. They were always identified when risks and the usual mitigation
    actions were proposed but proved elusive to improvement. A more realistic approach
    may be to work around “system problems? or to find altogether new approaches.
    This included, for example, a , simpler and faster “non-consulting services
    procurement? which is now being used in PNPM IV and helping Government reach a
    policy decision that enabled the government to pre-finance all subprojects and then
    seek reimbursement from the Bank.
•   Evaluation studies and use of their findings: Well-conceived and targeted
    evaluations can provide solid evidence of what works and what doesn’t work in the
    implementation of a program such as PNPM. Findings from such studies can provide
    policy recommendations to make improvements to project design and implementation,
    and also help to determine the future direction of the program. PNPM-Rural 1&2
    generated a number of relevant studies whose key findings are summarized in Annex
    2.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
The draft ICR was sent to the Coordinating Ministry for Social Welfare, Bappenas and
MOHA-PMD.

On June 18, 2012 the Director of Poverty Reduction of Bappenas advised that he agreed
with the draft ICR findings, and expressed the Goverment’s appreciation for the support
by donors through the PNPM Support Facility (PSF), which has allowed for a very strong
evaluations program to be conducted with much more implementation support than under
regular World Bank projects.

PMD in response to the draft has reported that the main lessons learnt are: (i) at the
Community level - increased community capacity to determine their needs; very
important that community empowerment comes through social interaction. Marginalized
people who previously did not trust Government now no longer perceive to be the object


                                           24
of development but rather the subject. This has been achieved through a CDD approach,
(ii) at the Local Government level: PNPM has raised awareness of local government
officials how to correctly treat the community and develop their capacity to make good
decisions, (iii) direct grants to communities: block grants to communities promote an
excellent learning process to support community empowerment through involvement in
decision-making and open-menu choices.

The following aspects should be considered for future loans: (i) local government
involvement - PNPM is aligned with government policy on regional autonomy. Currently
the program focuses on building community capacity by providing consultants and
facilitators at each level. In the future, local government needs to become more involved.
(ii) World Bank administration - the process of obtaining a No Objection Letter (NOL)
can be lengthy and it needs to be simplified. This is particularly important because the
Directorate General of Community and Village Empowerment (Ditjen, PMD) in the
Ministry of Home Affairs accounts for almost 75 % of the ministry’s budget. (iii) PNPM
Support Facility (PSF): the support from the World Bank through the PSF is very much
appreciated and going forward the following should be considered: how PSF can best
fulfill its role to assist the GOI and how support can move from the current detailed
policy and implementation advice to more strategic assistance.

(b) Co-financiers
The draft ICR was sent to AusAID, CIDA, DANIDA, EU, USAID, Government of
Netherlands, and IFAD but no comments have been received.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

While the Credit and Loans covered by this ICR closed only on December 31, 2011, 90%
of the proceeds were disbursed by December 31, 2009 and the majority of those
disbursements had been for Component 1, District Grants. . 21 In 2010 and 2011,
Component 1 was co-funded by PNPM Rural 3 and PNPM Rural 4. For example in 2010,
only 24% of the block grant budget was funded by PNPM 1 and 2 loans. The remaining
loan balance of 10% was used in 2010 and 2011 to fund Component 2 – Facilitation and
Training, Component 3 – Implementation Support and Technical Assistance, and
Component 4 – Support for Project Management –The description of outputs by
component draws on the Implementing Agency’s 2008 and 2009 annual reports, which
cover the time when the bulk of the proceeds of the loans were disbursed. In case of
discrepancies in these reports, the most conservative numbers are used. The 2010 output
will be covered by the subsequent ICR of PNPM Rural 3.

Although the number of provinces and districts remained the same, the number of PNPM
sub-districts increased in 2009 by about 45% (compared to 2008) and already almost
reach the revised target of 4,000.

Women’s access to block grants. Selection and funding of sub-projects is determined
based on funding proposals received from the participating communities. The program
guidelines guarantee that two proposals per village are formulated, and can be submitted,
by women only groups. The following table shows a breakdown of the origin of
proposals.



21
 The 2010 and 2011 activities under components 1 and 2 were co-financed by subsequent loans for PNPM
Rural 3 and PNPM Rural 4.

Out of a total of almost 120,000 successful proposals put forward by communities, more
than 60% originated from women’s groups at the village level. This not only indicates a
high level of participation by women, but also a strong voice.

Use of block grants. The main outputs of the project cover four sectors: (i) infrastructure,
(ii) education, (iii) health, and (iv) microcredit (SPP)22. The percentage of proposals in
the infrastructure sector was about 63%, but the number of beneficiaries from all
infrastructure sub-projects was about 84% of the total number of beneficiaries. This can

drainage can benefit the entire village population.

Health sub-project activities contributed to better health outcomes as shown in the health
outcome results presented below under PNPM-Generasi.

As illustrated in table 2.6, activities to foster access to finance, have provided
opportunities for over 1.7 million people to increase their incomes through starting and
running small businesses. A total 52,004 microcredit groups learned about, and gained
experience in, small business operations and financial management. The vast majority of
these groups were women’s groups (SPP), whereas a smaller percentage was mixed
groups (UEP) which had received funding under KDP.

Total actual disbursements of sub-district grants for PNPM 2008 and 2009 reached 90%
of the total original allocation of US$ 1.328 million. The actual disbursements from the
central (national) budget were 92% of the total allocation of US$ 1.018 million, and those
of the provincial and district governments attained 83% of the total original allocation of
US$ 310 million.

PNPM-Generasi – Outputs / Outcomes
An impact evaluation completed in 2010 showed that Generasi improved both health and
education indicators, on average, over the 30-month implementation period, with
particularly significant results in the end-line impact survey in 2010 (Wave III).
Specifically, the average standardized effects indicate that the Generasi program
succeeded in improving target indicators, particularly in Wave III. The Generasi impact
on the 12 indicators was 0.041 standard deviations. The effect was comparably sized in
health and education, at 0.038 standard deviations for health and 0.046 standard
deviations for education. As described above, the main long-term impact was a reduction
in childhood malnutrition (weight-for-age of children under three), which declined by 2.2
percentage points, about a 10% reduction from the control level. This reduction in
malnutrition was strongest in areas with a higher malnutrition rate prior to project
implementation, most notably in the Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) province, where
underweight rates were reduced by 8.8 percentage points, a 20% decline compared to
control areas; severe underweight rates were reduced by 5.5 percentage points, a 33 %
decline. Severe stunting was reduced by 6.6 percentage points, a 21% decline compared
to control areas.

PNPM-Generasi also saw dramatic increases in mothers and children participating in
village health post activities, to receive targeted maternal, neo-natal, and child health
services. On average, 11.2 additional children were weighed, 16.3 additional children
received nutrition supplements, 2.4 additional children were immunized, 1.3 additional
pregnant women received antenatal care, and 1.8 additional pregnant women received
iron pills at their last visit to the village health post. PNPM-Generasi’s impact on
education was less pronounced, although the program did increase the school
participation rate among the primary school-age group. Impact on education was driven
primarily by NTT province where enrollments by 7 to 12 year old students increased by


                                            31
3.8 percentage points, a 4% increase over control areas. NTT province also saw a 10.1
percentage point increase in junior secondary school enrollment rates.

Component 2 – Facilitation and Training

Facilitators are the most important asset of PNPM and are critically important for the
success of the program. The main outputs of this component were the hiring, training
(pre-service and refresher) and deployment to the field of consultants as sub-district
facilitators. It included training of trainers workshops, training and communication
materials, and also quality reviews. The facilitators contributed in a major way to the
project outcomes since they assisted the village communities throughout the sub-project
planning and implementation processes. Their responsibilities included quality assurance
of the process and of sub-projects implemented.

The total number of consultants and facilitators in 2009 increased substantially by 89%
(compared to 2008 quota); this was necessitated by the addition of a large number of sub-
districts. It required adjustments to the organizational structure for consultants and
facilitators, and regional management consultants were added. Actual deployment of
district facilitators only reached 87% in 2009, and the number of sub-district facilitators
reached 89% of the quota.

Component 3 – Implementation Support and Technical Assistance

Internal Audits

Component 3, among other activities, funded the day-to-day management of the program,
internal audits by NMC specialist staff, the mapping of health services and assessments
of the sub-district financial management units (UPK) that were also responsible for
managing the microcredit activities supported by PNPM-Rural.

An internal audit was done in 2010 for activities carried out in 2009. It examined 3,192
villages in 336 sub-districts and focused on planning processes, implementation
procedures, such as procurement of goods and services, financial activities, community
training, maintenance, and revolving funds activities. No details of the assessment are
available, but the overall finding, based on the sample examined, showed that the
management of the program was of reasonable quality.

The mapping of sub-district financial management units (UPK) showed the continued
importance of capacity building and technical assistance for UPKs as their number
increased.

Complaints Handling

Component 3 also supported the complaints handling system. Summary statistics of the
types of cases reported, and the categories of offenders, are presented in the table below.
A total of 2,155 complaints were lodged by various parties (community members,
facilitators, the audit agency, NGOs, mass media and Bank staff), and in 791 cases it was
found upon investigation that there was no problem. The other cases were followed up
and, as shown below, 57% of diverted funds has been recovered. Usually, if the missing
funds are returned by the offender, no legal action is taken – a preferred approach by the
communities.

During 2008 and 2009, PMD identified 175 “problem? sub-districts and suspended them
from the program by blocking disbursement of program funds. As a result of this sanction,
65% of the “problem? sub-districts (114 in number) managed to resolve their problems
and could resume PNPM activities – a very effective approach to dealing with problems
at the sub-district level as shown below.

Monitoring and Evaluation

The M&E framework provided for rigorous evaluations. Two major impact evaluations
were conducted. 25 These include the PNPM-Rural Impact Evaluation and the PNPM-
Generasi Impact evaluation.

The key findings from the PNPM-Rural impact evaluation are as follows:

     o PNPM Rural is having a positive impact on poverty reduction, economic
       household welfare, and service delivery.
     o PNPM-Rural is more effective in particular contexts (poor and remote,
       infrastructure deficient), suggesting that developing a more targeted approach
       could improve the overall impact for a range of indicators.
     o PNPM-Rural needs to improve its effectiveness in reaching out to marginalized
       groups.
     o PNPM-Rural remains a cost effective means of providing needed tertiary
       infrastructure of sufficient quality relative to other approaches.
     o PNPM is having positive impacts on social accountability/transparency within the
       program.
     o PNPM faces significant challenges in translating social accountability and
       transparency into a broader organizational culture and into a broader development
       decision-making process.
     o PNPM also faces challenges with its local partners: local government still has low
       ownership of the program and has not yet adopted PNPM principles of
       accountability and transparency into their organizational culture and broader
       development decision-making process.
     o In order to sustain positive outcomes of the program, the role and quality of
       facilitators needs to be strengthened with an emphasis on improving quality and
       quantity of facilitation available to each community. The heavy administrative
       burden, lack of sufficient training and lack of quality candidates for facilitator

  While these were not financed from the proceeds of the loans and credit covered in this ICR, they
provided information on the key performance indicators listed in the PAD. Beyond the efforts covered by
this ICR, the Indonesia PNPM Program has produced a range of analytical products that are available at
http://www.psflibrary.org/web/index.php.



                                                  37
     positions are considerable limiting factors in the efforts to improve the quality of
     facilitation.
   o PNPM demonstrates no significant impact on broad-based social dynamics and
     governance. The project is successful with regard to inclusion and governance
     within PNPM but the factors contributing to PNPM performance do not spill over
     into wider village affairs. Facilitation effectiveness and “routine? implementation
     are likely to be contributing factors as there is a tendency of “requirement
     satisfaction? that can lead community members to simply follow PNPM
     procedures but not embrace the principles behind them.

Key findings from the PNPM-Generasi Impact Evaluation are:

   o The PNPM-Generasi experience demonstrated that the PNPM-Rural community-
     driven development architecture and network, can be adapted as a platform for
     improving lagging health and education indicators, by stimulating demand for and
     utilization of services.
   o PNPM-Generasi is most effective in areas with low health and education status,
     not necessarily in areas identified as poor. Community incentives had mixed
     results—health responded more favorably than education.

Component 4 – Support for Project Management

The rapid scale up of PNPM Rural within only 3 years (since PNPM was launched in
2007) was made possible by decentralization of management of district and sub-district
facilitators from the center to provincial PIUs. This swift decision, though not without
some negative consequences, allowed more responsive management when it come to
mobilization and training of facilitator. During the first quarter of 2008, some delays in
salary payment was experienced but then MoF and the Central Bank came to assistance.
Signs of increase in nepotism in the selection and assignment of facilitators was
responded decisively by PMD sanctions and issuance of revised instructions on facilitator
management which reconfirmed central control and final decision.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

In the second quarter of 2012, a small-scale replication of a 2004/5 study ("Economic
Impact Analysis of Kecamatan Development Program Infrastructure Projects." Anthony
Torrens – World Bank. Draft. January 2005) was carried out. The study was done in 4
provinces (Jawa Tengah, Kalimantan Barat, Sulawesi Barat, and NTT) and for
approximately 48 recently completed PNPM infrastructure sub-projects. The types of
sub-projects evaluated, in both the 2004/5 study and the 2012 replication, were: (1) road
or bridge construction or improvements; (2) clean water supply construction; and (3)
drainage or irrigation construction or improvements. Both the 2004/5 study and its 2012
small-scale replication analyzed four distinct aspects related to local infrastructure: (1)
the economic internal "rate of return" (EIRR) on infrastructure investments; (2) the size
of the income or consumption multiplier on PNPM block grant funds used to build
infrastructure; (3) the cumulative costs of construction that PNPM sub-projects incurred
relative to estimated costs for local government procurement and construction of the
same/similar infrastructure items; and (4) a technical evaluation of the quality of the
infrastructure built by PNPM.

Regarding the EIRR of the main infrastructure types, the 2012 replication suggests rates
of return of between 35 and 75% for recent road/bridge, irrigation/drainage, or clean
water supply PNPM projects. This is broadly in line with the 2004/5 results, which
indicated EIRR values between 39 and 68%,– for the same types of sub-
projects. Regarding the income multiplier from PNPM funds, the 2012 replication
suggests an average, i.e. internal sub-district, income multiplier of 1.3 for the same types
of sub-projects. This is again broadly in line with the 2004/5 results that indicated an
average income multiplier of 1.2. Regarding the costs of construction, the 2004/5 study
showed that community-implemented (then) KDP infrastructure sub-projects cost 30 to
50% less than if they had been executed by local contractors while the recent replication
suggest savings for recently built PNPM sub-projects of between 35 to 40%.

Finally, regarding the quality of infrastructure constructed under the PNPM program, the
recent replication found that 75% (27 of 36) sub-projects were rated as "good" or
"excellent" for construction quality. This rate is somewhat lower than the 94% "good" or
"excellent" quality rate obtained by the 2004/5 KDP study. However, it compares
favorably with a larger-scale technical evaluation of PNPM infrastructure overall quality
that was carried out in the first half of 2012: it found 68% of about 350 inspected sub-
projects were of "sufficient" construction quality and 27% “slightly below
[specifications]?.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

There was no beneficiary survey but the preliminary results that were available from the
Technical Evaluation by April 2012, included inputs from community members and
households with regard to their perceptions of infrastructure functionality and utilization.
In the course of the survey, community members were asked about their interest in the
infrastructure and their perceptions of its impacts on their activities and everyday life.

Following below are results for “Functionality and Utilization? (of PNPM-Rural 1&2
infrastructure) from three provinces (Central Java, West Kalimantan and West Sulawesi),
39 sub-districts and about 200 villages with some 420 infrastructure sub-projects:

               High           65%
               Average        24%
               Low             8%
               N/A             3%

The perception of utilization can also be considered to be a good proxy for level of
satisfaction with the infrastructure.




                                            41
Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Stakeholder workshops were organized and hosted by the PSF in two provinces, from
February 15th to16th, 2012 in Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam, and February 23-24, 2012 in
West Java. PMD/NMC, as well as the provincial agencies concerned, supported, and
participated in, the workshops.

There was a good turnout of about 40 - 50 participants in each workshop, representing a
wide cross section of project stakeholders (local government staff, consultants /
facilitators, community members who were involved in implementation), including some
beneficiaries. Although project beneficiaries were clearly under-represented in these
workshops, they contributed meaningfully with positive and negative viewpoints. The
main findings, elaborated by the various stakeholders and divided into several focus areas,
were as follows:

1. Summary of all workshops

Good governance through transparency, participation, and accountability
PNPM has helped to improve the economy and community institutions, generated
employment, and promoted transparency and participation. In Aceh, the information
boards have been shown to improve transparency, and reduce conflict between
communities. Community meetings have been used as a learning experience to help
people, especially women, to be heard. Through these meetings empowerment and
community ownership of the program have also increased. The involvement of women in
the implementation, for example as members of the implementation team (TPK), also
increased their confidence and ability to manage the program.

But on the other hand, some project stakeholders thought that the program’s principles,
such as transparency, participation, and accountability, were degraded compared to the
KDP era. This happened particularly in the areas with massive elite capture, such as in
Papua, Madura, NTT, Sulawesi, Nias, and West Kalimantan. Elite capture also occurred
in the election of KPMD in Aceh, where performance was not considered as part of the
election criteria; the election was rather based on ‘connections’ or family relations.
Participation became mobilization, transparency was only available to the cronies, and
accountability was only applied during audits.

At the local government (LG) level, transparency was still weak, particularly in managing
the non-block grant funds. The iinvolvement of LG officials was very limited in program
implementation, beyond those of the implementing agency. The program seemed to be
exclusively owned by certain institutions, i.e. the district community empowerment
agency (BPMPD), such as in the district of Bandung Barat. Program management was
not well coordinated with other agencies within the district. This caused problems for
operating and maintaining the sub-projects effectively after their completion. Capacity
building often excluded LG officials and caused them to lose interest in the program.




                                           42
Economy and poverty reduction
The communities also said that PNPM has helped them to access local, low cost financial
institutions and helps community members to avoid private moneylenders in the village.
Nevertheless, no legal framework to ensure sustainability has been established for
savings and loan groups for women.. Some communities also said that poverty reduction
was not necessarily achieved through the Program. The open menu is not suited to
contribute to the improvement of the Human Development Index (IPM).

Support to the Government System
PNPM has contributed to better-organized and well-documented village planning by
introducing the participatory development planning method to villages. This was
achieved through the formulation of Village Mid-Term Plans and Village Annual Work
Plans. However, some project stakeholders found that the program’s linkage with
Musrenbang (the government’s routine programming and budgeting process) is
insufficient.

Program Design and Monitoring
A generalized policy for PNPM implementation in all participating districts, without any
exception or special treatment for certain areas, has actually created unfair conditions,
particularly in remote and disadvantaged areas, if compared to ‘normal’ areas.
Communities found that during program implementation numerous policy changes
occurred which potentially hindered the progress and also disrupted the quality of outputs.

Program implementation and monitoring mostly focused on disbursement of funds and
physical works rather than on community empowerment and institutionalization of the
systems that were developed through the program.

Many local institutions built by PNPM, such as BKAD and the UPK were thought to be
lacking in program ownership, at least in Aceh. This was caused by a lack of (i)
operational budget, and (ii) a capacity building program for them. At the same time, they
felt overwhelmed by all the other tasks they had to do, like managing the provincial
PNPM program (BKPG) and the district Poverty Alleviation Program (PEPK2) in Aceh.

The audit methods used by the central government auditors (BPKP) were thought to be
irrelevant for the program, because BPKP only focused on the quality of the outputs and
did not assess the quality of participation. Communities thought this was unfair, because
BPKP applied the same standards of quality for infrastructure built by contractors (in
other projects) and for works built by the community.

Opinions expressed by communities in different parts of the country consistently said that
a reward-and-sanction system was needed in PNPM: good results would be recognized
through some kind of reward while poor results would be subject to sanctions.




                                           43
Program Outputs
The PNPM-Rural program has contributed to more and better access to basic
infrastructure in villages, such as roads, water supply systems, and sanitation, which was
really needed by the poor. It has also successfully built infrastructure at lower costs when
compared to other government projects. Nevertheless, the challenge that remains is the
maintenance (O&M) of those infrastructure works. O&M is often lacking and faces
several challenges, either because the local community is not willing – or not able – to
allocate adequate O&M budgets, or there is no district level regulation to ‘protect’
PNPM’s outputs. A criticism of the type of sub-projects was that the majority’s
preference was usually basic infrastructure, so facilities for health and education often
lost out in the competition.

Implementation Support and Facilitation of the Program
Indicators to measure the program’s success have not yet been well disseminated:
provincial coordinators thought that the Program does not have any indicators to really
measure participation, poverty reduction, and implementation of revolving loan funds.
Some community members thought that facilitators (in the sub-districts) are still weak in
their basic competence, and commitment. Provincial coordinators said that many of the
facilitators involved in the project are unable to provide the necessary quality of
facilitation. Evidently, more effective facilitation design (and training) is needed.
Facilitators reported that they were often overwhelmed with various tasks – including
additional pilot initiatives and, such as in Aceh, the province’s own program (BKPG) –as
well as reports that needed to be submitted in a very limited time. With a complex
program structure and many stakeholders, facilitators faced big challenges trying to assist
and work with all of them.

Provincial coordinators found that institutional performance in PNPM, such as by
TNP2K, BAPPENAS, PSF, MOHA-PMD, was still weak, though better coordination
among the actors has started. The comprehensiveness of PNPM was also found to be
lacking in some areas. This was demonstrated by repeated requests for data, limited
knowledge of the PNPM “Grand Design / Road Map?, and differences in the results
indicators used by different institutions. They also thought that monitoring and evaluation
by PSF needed to be more focused, and that they should communicate the results as
feedback to the provinces. Lastly, PMD was viewed as weak in consultant management,
with delays in processing the contracts (i) for mobilizing consultants and facilitators, and
(ii) for pre-service and refresher training for facilitators.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

PMD produces annual program reports for PNPM (as they did for KDP in the past), but
they usually do not issue an “implementation completion report? as such for a specific
Bank “project? as defined by Bank loans and credits. Below is a very brief summary of
the relevant PNPM-Rural Annual Reports for 2008 and 2009. It includes the abbreviated
Executive Summary of the 2009 report, and the key section on “Potentials and
Perspectives for Program Sustainability?. Supporting tables with quantitative information
and data on outputs have been omitted because this information is included in the Bank’s
ICR in Annex 2. The text excerpted from PMD’s annual reports is included verbatim, but
edits have been made for clarity and better understanding.


ABBREVIATED EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF PMD ANNUAL REPORT 2009

1. Background of PNPM-Rural
In the framework for improving the effectiveness of poverty alleviation and job creation
efforts, the government has launched a National Community Empowerment Program
(PNPM)-Rural. The program was to reformulate the mechanism and process of poverty
alleviation efforts that involve the community in the overall process of activities
formulation, from the stages of planning and executing up to monitoring and evaluation.
By this process of participatory development, the critical awareness and community self-
reliance senses, particularly for poor people, can be regenerated and better developed.
The communities are therefore positioned as the subject in the poverty alleviation effort
rather than as only the passive object.

Implementation of PNPM-Rural in 2007 was started by the Kecamatan Development
Project (KDP/PPK) as the development basis for community empowerment in the rural
areas. This has been implemented since 1998, alongside its support programs such as
PNPM Generation and NCEP-Urban or Urban Poverty Project (UPP/P2KP), as a
development basis for community empowerment in the urban areas, and the Program for
Accelerating Development in the Special and Disadvantaged Areas (SPADA/ P2DTK)
that emphasized the development of the underdeveloped, post-disaster and conflict
regions. Since 2008, PNPM in Rural areas involved other rural programs: The SPADA
mentioned above, The regional infrastructure for the Social-Economic Development
(RISE/PISEW – JICA funded) and rural infrastructure program (RIS/ PPIP – GoI-ADB
funded) which focused on underdeveloped villages.

The expected achievements by program objectives are:
   1. An improvment in welfare and and job opportunities for poor people.
   2. An increase in community participation, including poor people, women,
      indigenous and vulnerable people, in the process of decision-making and the
      management of local development.
   3. An improvement in the capacity of legitimate, representative and accountable
      community institutions.




                                           45
   4. Strengthening the government’s capacity to provide public services to
      communities, particularly for poor people, through pro-poor policies,
      programming and budgeting.
   5. An improvement in the synergy between the communities, local government,
      private sectors, associations, universities, NGOs, community institutions and
      other respective groups in encouraging the effectiveness of the poverty alleviation
      efforts.
   6. Increasing community self-reliance and an improvment in the capacity of local
      governments and local respective groups to reduce the poverty in their region.
   7. An improvement in the social capital of the community so that growth is in line
      with the local socio-cultural potential and local wisdom is preserved.
   8. An increase in the innovation and utilization of appropriate technology,
      information and communication in the community empowerment process.

In the implementation of this community-based program, sub-district/Kecamatan, is the
focus of the program to harmonize the functions of planning, implementing and
controlling. Moreover the program aims to ensure that the community is the main policy
maker as well as the main development agent at the local level. Through the approaches
of participatory development and community empowerment, universal values and the
local culture are prioritized, in particular with regard to local social, cultural and
geographical characteristics.

The long-term vision of PNPM-Rural, is to achieve the social welfare and self-reliance of
the poor in rural areas. Social welfare is translated as the provision of basic community
needs, and self-reliance is formulated as a capacity to self-organize in mobilizing the
local resources in their environment, and a capacity to access the available resources
outside of their environment, and then to manage all respective potential resources in
solving the current poverty problems in the local area.

The mission of the PNPM-Rural, in the medium-term up to 2015, is to assist and
facilitate the programs in:
(a) Developing the community capacity/capability and community institutions therein.
(b) Institutionalizing the participatory development system.
(c) Strengthening the role and function of local governments.
(d) Increasing the social-economic condition of communities through basic infrastructure
provision.
(e) Encouraging networking to build development partnerships.

2. Program Scale and Coverage in 2009
The scale of the program for 2009 was directed and stipulated by the Government to
cover 3,905 sub-districts within 342 districts spread out in 30 provinces. The total area
coverage in 2009 has increased by about 75%, as compared to the total area coverage in
2008.




                                           46
3. Implementation Management and Organization in 2009
PNPM-Rural Program for implementation in 2009 is managed by the government in
cooperation with local governments, and involves the private sector as consultants,
experts and facilitators. Furthermore, at every implementation stage, it leads to
community involvement. At the national/central level, the Directorate General of
Community and Village Empowerment (PMD) in the Ministry of Home Affairs is
operating as the Executing Agency; which means acting as Central Development
Secretariat for PNPM-Rural. In addition, at the central level, a Controlling Team is
established under the coordination of the Coordinating Ministry of People’s Welfare
(Kemenkokesra). Moreover, at the central level, coordination is also provided by the
National Management Consultant (NMC/KMN) made up of consulting services and
experts.

At the district level, it is also supported by consulting services known as Regional
Management Consultant (RMC), which are divided into six regional working areas
consisting of region-1 to region-6 within which the RMC coordinate, and are responsible
for, several provinces. In each province, a Working Unit of PNPM-Rural is established
under the Community and Village Empowerment Body (BPMD) or other institution that
is responsible for community empowerment affairs in the province. The Provincial
Working Unit is not only the party in charge of the implementation of PNPM-Rural
activities at the provincial level, but also acts as the executive of de-concentration
activities for the procurement of district facilitators as well as sub-district facilitators. In
supporting the implementation of activities at the provincial level, a consultant and expert
unit is established, which is recruited by the RMC and coordinated by Provincial
Coordination (Korprov).

At the district level, a District Working Unit of PNPM-Rural is also established. This is
assigned as the executing agency of Assistance Task activities ; where all entire Direct
Community Grants (BLM) for the district, as well as the supporting funds in terms of the
Activities Operational Fund for Activities (DOK) which are allocated in DIPA Assistance
Task (TP) are managed. In order to carry out technical activities in the field, it is assigned
three District Facilitators at the district level which consist of one Empowerment
Facilitator, one Technical Facilitator and one Financial Facilitator.

At a sub-district level, for each sub-district, an Inter Village Cooperation Body (BKAD)
is initiated and developed by the community as the working organization. Its
development is based on the Inter-Village Deliberation and Consensus
mechanism(MAD), in selecting and setting for example the Implementation Management
Unit (UPK), the Oversight Body of UPK (BP-UPK), a Verification Team and local
facilitators, that all come from the community element. At the sub-district level, besides
the Sub-district Head, as the responsible person for all local activities, an Activities
Operational Officer (PjOK) is also established, represented by a government officer at the
sub-district level. To facilitate the implementation of activities at sub-district and village
level, two facilitators are assigned in each sub-district - District Facilitator and Technical
Facilitator (with a Civil Engineering background). At the village level, besides the
village head as the responsible person for local activities, an Implementing Team (TPK)



                                              47
is also established for activities, assisted by two Village Community Empowerment
Cadres (KPMD) and a Special Team to oversee and monitor all activity phases at the
village level.

The local government, both at the province and district level, are involved in the
implementation of PNPM Mandiri-Rural in the capacity of the executing agency for De-
concentration Activities and Assistance Tasks. The district/ local government through the
District Working Unit for PNPM-Rural, acts as the executing agency for Assistance Task
activities and is responsible for channeling Community Grant (BLM) and Operational
Funds (DOK). Besides providing parts of BLM funding due to local fiscal capacity (the
Local Fund for Joint Program,DDUPB), the district/local government also has to provide
a minimum amount of 5% of the total ceiling of the BLM fund that is allocated in the
District.

In 2009 11,059 facilitators were required, especially for PNPM-Rural at district and sub-
district levels.. The total demand for all consultants and facilitators including facilitators
for special programs (such as RESPEK in Papua and Papua Barat, R2PN on Nias Island)
as well as for other supporting programs, reached 11,588. Furthermore, at each sub-
district level a local assistant was also assigned. In total there were 3,905 assistants in all
sub-districts. At the village level a minimum of two village community empowerment
cadres (KPMD) were assigned , reaching a total of 100,402 in all villages.

4. Components and Scope of Program Activity in 2009
The implementation of PNPM in rural areas for 2009 covers several components and
works that simultaneously and consistently have been implemented in the current period,
as described below:

(1) The Main Component of the program, which is the main focus and target of PNPM-
Rural:
    • Regular PNPM, constituting PNPM-Rural activity using normal procedures and
       mechanisms, according to the existing standards on a repetitive basis. This
       component of the activity was implemented in 3,905 sub-districts, in 342 districts
       within 30 provinces (excluding Papua and Papua Barat).
    • PNPM RESPEK, constituting PNPM-Rural activity, which used special patterns
       and mechanisms to support the implementation of Specific Autonomy in Papua
       and Papua Barat Provinces. This component of the activity was implemented in
       28 districts that cover 436 sub-districts.

(2) Component Program Support, constitutes PNPM-Rural activity and uses specific
patterns and procedures, according to certain needs and targets, and includes pilot
projects or efforts to support the emergency-response condition, rehabilitation or
revitalization of communities.. The scope of activity covers:
    • The PNPM Generasi Pilot Activity, constituting PNPM-Rural activity to support
        the improvement in quality of human resources, especially in the younger
        generation, through health improvements in under-fives, in mothers and children,
        as well as through improvements in basic education. The implementation of


                                              48
       PNPM Generasi, used specific patterns and procedures, according to the specific
       standards, applied for the Healthy and Smart Generation (PTO-Generasi) and
       these were undertaken within the repetitive nature of the project.. This activity
       was implemented in 164 sub-districts, within 21 districts in 5 provinces..
   •   The special Activity of PNPM Post-Disaster, constituting specific activities
       intended to provide support to areas that had been affected by disasters; this
       covers 1 district and 16 sub-districts.
   •   P2SPP Pilot Activity, constituting the experimental activity to support and
       develop the development and participatory planning in rural areas and at district
       level; This covers pilot areas in 10 districts within 8 provinces.

5. Implementation Results of PNPM-Rural in 2009

5.1 PNPM-Rural

From 3,905 sub-districts within PNPM-Rural locations in 2009, 1,612 sub-districts were
indicated as new sub-districts that for the first time gained allocation from PNPM-Rural
in 2009, while 2,293 sub-districts, had been involved in PNPM-Rural since 2008 or prior.
The Community proposals above are classified into four categories by activity type,
covering:
    (i) Public Infrastructure Activities: 29,602 proposals, about 42.3% of the total.,
    (ii) Education Activities: 7,710 proposals ,about 11% of the total.
    (iii)Health Activities: 3,643 proposals, about 5.2% of the total.
    (iv) Microcredit for Women Activities (SPP) and Improvement in Productive
         Economic Activity (UEP) Capacity:29,051 proposals,about 41.5% of the total.

The activity for capacity building in PNPM-Rural for 2009, was implemented by taking
into account the coverage area, the extent of program, and various stakeholder interests
that must be covered. The focus in capacity building effort for 2009 was emphasized to
the programs: improvements in information distribution, information dissemination,
strengthening the stakeholders’ capacity at a community level and the development of
several types of media. Relavant results that can be identified for 2009 include the
preparation of training media and reading material to support the training. The training
media preparation that has been facilitated and reproduced for capacity building, covers:
(i) audiovisual media consisting of ‘Planning Activity, Facilitation of Idea Exploring,
Implementation Phase, Building Together with People and Audiovisual of Papua’, (ii)
Softcopy consisting of a book for village community empowerment (KPMD), UPK,
BKAD and SPP brochures as well as the procurement of goods and services through
tender, that can be printed according to training needs.

6. Potentials and Perspectives for Program Sustainability
The result of implementation experiences up to 2009, in terms of potential or positive
trends, that can be further developed in the implementation phase of PNPM-Rural for the
following years is summarized as follows:

About 50,200 villages have been facilitated through this program, in the administrative
areas of about 3,900 sub-districts. This has involved the local government in 348 districts
within the coverage area of 32 provinces. Furthermore, the budget already allocated for
this program in in 2009 was from various sources of fund: the state budget at around
60%: the local budget (as a counterpart) at around 20.5%; and the World Bank Loan at
around 19.5%. These capital resources will constitute the potential to drive economic
activities or the real business sector in the rural area, and also to encourage the creation of
pro-poor policies by the local governments in delivering and developing more quality
public services.

Participation and Community Involvement in the Rural Areas
In2009, the implementation of PNPM-Rural in almost all Indonesian territories is able to
mobilize and organize close to 19 million people to participate at the community level in
the processes innovated by the program. From this total, more than 10 million people are
categorized as poor people (approx.53%), and almost 9.3 million people are women
(around 49%). Moreover, 100,400 people in rural areas have been successfully prepared
and employed as village facilitators/KPMD to support the tasks and duties of the sub-
district facilitators in each of the assignment areas.

The social-capital of the communities in the rural areas, and at sub-district levels has
therefore been enhanced and could further be developed; communities have developed
the skills needed to organize development activities to improve the quality of life and
welfare of rural communities in the future.

Development and Strengthening the Community Institutions
The efforts that have been made by PNPM-Rural in developing and strengthening the
community institutions at the rural and sub-district levels, whether through innovations of
new institutions or changes to existing institutions, have been successful in organizing
and strengthening 3,905 BKAD institutions in sub-districts , including their units and
apparatus (UPK, BP-UPK and Verification Team). While at the rural level, PNPM has
successfully innovated and organized various working units and teams (TPK, TPU, TP-3
and Special Team for Monitoring) in each rural area. In the available institutions or
working units and teams, about 2.2 million people have gained from the capacity building,
training delivery, and from facilitation or coaching in field implementation. The related
funds that have already been realized, include approximately 70% for planning and the
remaining 30% for community training.

These institutional resources, supported by training and resulting in a wide range of
human resources, have an extraordinary potential and power to increase the bargaining
position of the community when they encounter external parties involved in development
activities and to improve the community's welfare in their local area.

Investment in Resources and Activities
PNPM-Rural has invested several resources and various activities in accommodating
community needs. The invested resources are in terms of technical assistance through



                                              50
consultant and facilitator services to facilitate and guide the local government and
community in the target area. More than 11,500 consultants and facilitators have offered
assistance in 2009, in all target areas of PNPM-Rural in Indonesia. The above
investments have the potential to be utilized by the community and local area in the long-
term; in particular in relation to technology selection, the application of practical and
appropriate management, as well as the awareness and capacity to prioritise development
activities based on the real needs of community.

Perspectives for Sustainability
The potential that has been successfully generated and grown in the implementation of
PNPM-Rural during the previous years, needs to be studied and reviewed in-depth for
future implementation. This should be done in order to maintain the positive dynamic,
and can be supported by the appropriate stimulation in order to enhance the preservation
and sustainability of the innovations Finally, the results of the learning processes of the
empirical experiences in implementation should be disseminated and shared in a public
space or forum at an appropriate place and time.

(a) Program Policy and Management Aspects
In order to realize the use of the National Grand Strategy, PNPM-Rural as the basis for
implementation in 2010 and subsequent years for all relevant parties, formal and legal
support is needed from the Directorate General of PMD, as the Program Executing
Agency. Concrete and legal guarantees are required, relating to the timely availability of
funds for the implementation of PNPM-Rural activities, whether relating to the
allocation/revision of DIPA at a central level or the allocation of DDUB by the regional
party.

(b) Implementation Planning Aspects
The accuracy in realizing all activities, including suitability of results attainment is highly
affected by the accuracy rate of planning arranged. For the implementation in 2010 and
subsequent years, it requires an Annual Implementation Work Frame based on the
National Grand Strategy and National Evaluation Result against realization of
implementation in the previous year. This work frame will become the reference of all
parties nationally in operating all activities already arranged and agreed. Therefore the
consistency of many parties is required to be able to comply with all corridors stipulated,
with consequence that whenever there is amendment or revision of this work frame, it
should be communicated and discussed in the national forum/meeting.

(c) Implementation of Activities Aspects
To optimize the participatory planning process effectively and efficiently at the
community level, it requires a form of acceleration/breakthrough of measures in realizing
the Implementation Cycle already stipulated by not repeating the process phase already
accomplished/implemented in the previous years (by utilizing the activities already
prioritized and not funded previously). As an effort to synergize the results of a
community’s planning through PNPM-Rural by using the regular village development
plan (RPJMDs), it is necessary to integrate the existing plans through the Musrenbang
mechanism from village level to district level.

(d) Preservation and Sustainability Aspects
The potentials which have been successfully generated and grown in the implementation
of PNPM-Rural during the previous years, should be studied and reviewed thoroughly in
the following project implementations, with the aim of maintaining the positive dynamic
raised and to support the right direction and stimulation in terms of enhancing the
innovations’ preservation and sustainability.

Finally, the results of learning through the empirical experiences in implementation
should be disseminated and shared in a public space or forum at an appropriate time and
place.
