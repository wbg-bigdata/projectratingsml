I. INTRODUCTION
A.   ackground
1.01      The Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt has requested Bank
financing of US$69 million equivalent to assist the National Spinning and
Weaving Company (NSWC), a public sector enterprise, in implemen _ng its
urgently needed rehabilitation and modernization program (the Project).
The Project involves the installation of a spinning mill with a capacity of
6,600 tons per year (tpy) of polyester/cotton as well as 100% cotton yarn and
a weaving mill with a capacity of 20 million linear meters per year (equiv-
alent to 28 million square meters per year (smpy)) of fabric and the moderni-
zation of most of NSWC's existing production units located in Alexandria. The
project facilities are expected to start commercial operation by April 1984;
about 10% (by weight) of the output will be exported. The Project's fiber raw
material requirements are imported short-staple cotton (58%), Egyptian medium
to long-staple cotton (14%) and polyester (28%), which will be locally pro-
duced starting in late 1980. The Project will involve strengthening of the
management and organization of NSWC which is presently weak and its success
will critically depend on significant progress in this area. A key aspect of
the Project is the transformation of NSWC from a public to a joint-venture
sector enterprise which will give autonomy to the Company regarding pricing,
profit retention and more importantly enable the Company to implement person-
nel policies and a compensation system adequate to attract and retain quali-
fied employees.
1.02      NSWC will implement the Project through a project implementation
unit mostly staffed with newly recruited qualified personnel which will be
assisted by foreign technical consultants. The Project is expected to cost
about US$104 million equivalent including about US$79 million in foreign
exchange. It will be financed with 34% equity (US$35 million) from the
Government and private shareholders including local financial institutions
and the balance of 66%, corresponding to 87% of the foreign exchange cost,
will be financed by the proposed Bank loan of US$69 million.
1.03      Following preparatory missions in July and September 1977, the
Project was appraised in October 1977 by a mission consisting of Messrs.
D. Carpio (Chief), E. Bolte and A. Sandig of the Industrial Projects Depart-
ment and Mr. F. Kaps of Country Programs Department I, EMENA Region. After
the Government completed in August 1979 an extensive review of the investment
plans in the textile sector to ensure a balanced growth of capacity and
demand, the Project was re-appraised in November 1979 by a mission consist-
ing of Messrs. D. Carpio (Chief) and H. Oteifa of the Industrial Projects
Department.
B.   Bank Group Involvement in the Egyptian Textile_Industry
1.04      Besides an IDA credit of US$18.5 million made in 1973 for the Cotton
Ginning Rehabilitation Project (Cr. No. 423-EGT), Bank Group involvement in
the Egyptian textile sector started with a study of that sector by Werner
International (USA) as part of the Bank Group's Agricultural and Industrial
Imports Project (Cr. No. 524-EGT and Loan No. 1062-EGT) of December 1974.
This study was completed in April 1976 and its preliminary findings provided
the basis for the Bank's first textile project which was approved in June



-2-
1976 (Loan No. 1292-EGT) for US$52 million to assist two public sector firms,
Misr Fine Spinning and Weaving Company - Kafr El Dawar (KED) and Misr El Beida
Dyers (EB), in their expansion programs. Nine other public sector textile
companies also received a total of about US$11 million from the Bank's Second
Industrial Import Loan (Loan No. 1456-EGT) towards modernizing their
facilities. Within the context of the Bank's industrial policy dialogue, the
Bank is discussing a series of studies aimed at: (a) upgrading the industrial
planning capability of the Government; (b) developing an appropriate
industrial strategy and policies for the 1980's including a list of priority
projects; and (c) developing specific action programs for the textile and
metallurgical industries. The action program for the textile sector will
include the identification of priority projects which will form part of the
Government's medium-term (1981-85) capital investment plan for the textile
industry. Finally, IFC made an investment of US$0.6 million in the Nile
Clothing Company, S.A. (Report No. IFC 7757, October 12, 1977) for a project
which recently started production of ready-made garments for exports.
1.05      Overall implementation of the Bank's first textile project is satis-
factory, although initial delays in the mobilization of the civil works con-
tractor and the scarcity of construction materials in Egypt have delayed
project completion by about 28 months - to September 1981. Estimated cost of
the project has increased by about US$20 million, or 13%, all due to local
cost increases primarily for civil works. Additional local financing on
satisfactory terms has been arranged with the Government. No increase in the
foreign exchange cost has occurred or is anticipated. However, the Arab Fund
Loan (US$34.5 million) for the project was suspended in late 1979 and the
undisbursed portion (US$30 million) has been partly replaced by foreign
commercial bank loans (US$10 million) with the balance being covered by the
Government and from the companies' resources.
11. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND TEXTILE INDUSTRY
A.   The Industrial Sector
2.01      Industry has become a significant sector of the Egyptian economy;
it accounted for about 15% of GDP in 1978 and employed 1.2 million, or nearly
12% of the civilian labor force. About 37% of commodity exports originate
in industry. Some 200, mostly large, publicly-owned industrial enterprises
dominate the sector, providing two-thirds of value added and half of industrial
employment. The private sector industry has about 4,000 mostly small enter-
prises employing 10 or more workers. Artisan shops with less than 10 workers
comprise an additional 100,000 establishments with over 300,000 employees.
2.02      Recent performance of the public industrial sector on the whole has
been mixed as reflected in the growth of output and exports. Real aggregate
output growth in 1973 and 1974 was low (about 2.1% and 2.6% per year) but it
accelerated to almost 9% annually during 1975-78. However, preliminary esti-
mates for 1979 indicate an annual output growth of only 3%. Public sector
exports in current terms increased sharply from LE 118 million in 1973 to
LE 168 million in 1974, but stagnated during 1975-77. They again increased
sharply to LE 270 million in 1978. The performance of the private sector



- 3 -
during the past five years has been somewhat better.  Total private sector
output which stagnated during 1972-74 increased remarkably by an average of
11% annually in real terms between 1975 and 1978 but increased only modestly,
by 8%, in 1979. Private industrial exports as a percentage of private sector
output declined from 11% in 1975 to 4% in 1978 and actually decreased in
current terms from LE 54 million in 1975 to LE 44 million in 1978.
2.03      The public sector has been responsible for the lion's share of total
industrial investment accounting for almost 90% of total investments in
1975-78. Following the Government's more liberal policies toward the private
sector, its share of total industrial investment is estimated to have increased
from about 4% during 1969-74 to about 10% during 1975-78. Also, investment
licenses granted to the private sector by the General Organization for Indus-
trialization (GOFI) increased from LE 67 million in 1975 to LE 167 million in
1978. These data portend an accelerated pace of private investment in the
coming years provided sufficient resources are made available in local
currency and in foreign exchange. In addition, foreign investment in joint-
venture projects is likely to increase as a result of amendments to the
foreign investment law that were legislated in June 1977 (para 2.05).
2.04      The past performance of Egyptian industry does not reflect its full
potential, since shortage of foreign exchange needed for imported inputs and
a low level of investments for modernization and expansion has limited capac-
ity utilization and output growth. The mixed performance of the public sector
industry is also a result of inadequate management and labor policies inducing
overstaffing and low labor productivity due to lack of appropriate incentives
to workers. In addition, the administrative structure, which is characterized
in most public sector industries by insufficient decentralization of authority
to enterprise management, has proved to be an obstacle to efficient operation
of public industrial enterprises. In the public textile sector, however, some
important operational functions are effectively performed by the enterprise
management (Section E of this Chapter). Other major issues facing the indus-
trial sector include the need for revising the system of price controls and
the import tariff structure. For the private sector industry, there is a need
to establish a long range policy to promote its further development.
2.05      In the context of lending to industry and formulating technical
assistance activities, the Bank has had, and proposes to continue, discus-
sions of the above-mentioned sector issues. Some improvements have already
been achieved through focussed lending and technical assistance in the prep-
aration of investment plans and policies for various industrial branches.
Thus, the Bank has been able to: (a) make some progress towards developing
long-term lending practices through two IDA credits and two Bank loans to
the Development Industrial Bank; (b) help modernize Egypt's major industry--
textiles--with loans for two major public textile enterprises; (c) help to
bring about better utilization of existing industrial capacity through two
import loans which provided much needed foreign exchange for the import of
raw materials and the balancing of equipment, thereby improving plant effi-
ciency; and (d) provide assistance to expanding fertilizer and cement produc-
tion, both projects involving modernization and improvements in management.
The Government has also made progress in the following area: Law 43 of 1974,
which is to encourage foreign private investment in Egypt has been amended
in 1977 making it more effective, mainly by reducing taxes and facilitating



-4-
profit transfer. The Bank will continue to seek policy improvements in the
context of the proposed Project and future lending, sector studies, and
technical assistance activities.
B.   Cotton Supplies
2.06      While Egypt is a minor cotton producer accounting for only 3% to 4%
of world production and about 4% of world exports in recent years, it is an
important exporter of medium, long, and extra long-staple cotton, accounting
for about 40% of world trade of medium and long-staple cotton (fiber length
1-3/16 to 1-6/16 inches) and about 60% of extra long-staple (fiber length
over 1-6/16 inches). Egyptian cotton is suitable for the manufacture of high
quality yarn and cloth and international prices of medium, long and extra
long-staple cotton have been about 40%, 60% and 75%, respectively, higher than
the world market prices of the standard short-staple cotton. The high profit-
ability to the Egyptian economy of cotton production and exports is not passed
on fully to the farmer as farm prices, for example, were only about 35% to 50%
of the equivalent export prices during the late 1970's (para 3.03). While
cotton still provides the major source of cash, farmers are wary of Government
controls and low profitability and have been turning to more rewarding crops
with less Government intervention, thus forcing the Government to accept a
revision of the cotton acreage quotas. The declining trend in cotton produc-
tion and cotton exports since 1970 is being reversed only recently as demon-
strated in the table below:

a/   Apparent consumption does not take into account changes in inventory levels.
2.07      About 60% of the cotton requirements of the Egyptian textile industry
can be satisfied by short-staple cotton as the fabrics produced are mostly
for local consumption. But Egypt does not produce short-staple cotton and
until 1974 (para 2008) did not import any to avoid the risk of infestation of
the local cotton crop. Consequently, the domestic textile mills used mostly
medium-staple cotton and some long-staple cotton while exports were mostly
long and extra long-staple cotton. While local textile consumption increased,
total cotton production stagnated or declined and the medium staple cotton
crop, which constitutes only one fourth of the country's cotton output, became
-nadaq-u-a s.4As a co-sequence, increasingly more long-staple cotton has been
diverted to the local textile mills, thus cutting severely into the country's
raw cotton export value which was not compensated by increases in textile
exports. This trend of declining cotton production and exports has prompted
the Goveznment to grad.ia liy increase the farm level cotton prices which have
been keyp.: artificially 'Low. The largest increase was effected in 1979 (32.2%)



- 5 -
thereby raising the farm gate cotton price by about 93% above the 1974 level.
However, the present price is still only about 50% of international prices
adjusted to the farm level. The Government will need to continously review
its agricultural policies, especially the pricing of farm outputs and inputs
in order to ensure an optimal pattern of crops given the changing resource
base and market opportunities in the country and abroad.
2.08      As Egyptian cotton production is not likely to increase in the
future, the Government has taken steps to release more valuable long-
staple cotton for export and replace it with lower-cost imported short-staple
cotton. The use of imported short-staple cotton was first tried in 1974; it
proved satisfactory, as the risk of infestation of the local cotton crop was
avoided by restricting imports to mills located away from cotton growing areas
and by burning the baling materials. The f'rst major quantities (about 25,000
tons) were imported in 1976, and continued at the same level through 1979.
For example, the Natioral Spinning and Weaving Company, i.e. the beneficiary
of the proposed loan, which tried a small quantity of imported cotton for the
first time in 1975, increased its use in 1977 and 1978 to about 5,000 tons,
equivalent to approximately 36% of its total cotton consumption of 14,000
tons. Imported short-staple cotton can also be economically complemented by
polyester fiber, now that the 25,000 tpy polyester plant near Alexandria is
about to start production in late 1980.
2.09      Other means to increase the amount of raw cotton available for ex-
ports would be the proper management of cotton wastes. It may be possible
to save up to 8% of the total local cotton presently consumed by applying
suitable waste control and by substituting to some extent carded yarns for
the finer and higher-priced combed yarns used in textile products for the
local market. However, due to the low domestic cotton price in the past
coupled with insufficient financial resources to replace obsolete machinery,
there has been little incentive to reduce waste. About 12,000 tons of cotton
waste were exported annually during the past years. Cotton waste is suitable
for the production of coarse cloth (e.g., rationed fabrics, para 3.08) for the
local market, but Egypt is only now beginning to install sufficient equipment
capacity to process this material. In 1978 and again in 1979, the Govern-
ment raised the local price of raw cotton to the spinning companies by a
cumulative total of about 185% (there has been no change since 1970). The
current local price plus the production tax on yarn makes the delivered
cost of the local medium-staple cotton to the spinning mills about equal to
80% of the imported price of short-staple cotton which could substitute for
the local cotton in most uses. These price increases have spurred the industry
to invest in additional open-end spinning rotors to process the waste cotton.
There were only 3,068 open-end rotors in 1979 but this is expected to increase
to 13,200 by 1982.
C.   Textile Industry in Egypt
2.10      The textile industry is Egypt's largest and most important indus-
trial sub-sector. Some 330,000 people are employed in spinning, weaving,
finishing and garment making, representing about one-third of the industrial
work force. Gross value added in textile and apparel industries in 1978 was
about 25% of the manufacturing industry's value added. Textile products
represented 50% of industrial exports (excluding petroleum) and 18% of the
country's total exports in 1978.



-6-
2.11      Past growth of the textile industry has been substantially below
that of the other industrial sub-sectors and its share in total industrial
value added decreased from 45% in 1947 to 38% in 1966/67 and about 25% in 1978.
The market has never presented a constraint to the expansion of the textile
industry, as domestic demand is substantial and foreign markets largely un-
tapped. Low production efficiency, a product line limited to 100% cotton
materials, and inferior quality, however, have been the industry's major
development problems. The relative decline of the textile industry was
especially marked during the recent ten-year period 1969-1979, when the output
of textile products increased by only 3% per year on average as compared to an
estimated 4.5% for industry as a whole. During this period, employment in the
textile industry increased only marginally and thus contributed little to the
improvement of the country's severe under-employment problem. In the 1960's,
textile exports performed well, with its share of total exports increasing
from about 10% in the early 1960's to about 20% in the early 1970's. But
because of the rapid rise in petroleum export revenues during the last three
years, the share of textile exports to total export revenue declined from
21% in 1974 to an estimated 14% in 1979. If petroleum exports are excluded,
however, the share of textile exports increased slightly from 23% in 1974 to
24% in 1979. The expansion of textile exports in the 1960's and the early
1970's took place mainly in the framework of bilateral trade agreements mostly
with Eastern European countries, where export earnings are in non-convertible
currencies. Efforts to increase exports of textiles to convertible-currency
markets have been hampered by insufficient product quality and lack of market
ties.
D.   Structure of the Textile Industry
2.12      The textile industry is dominated by 30 large public sector enter-
prises (Annex 2-1), which were nationalized in 1963, leaving only a small part
of up to 5% of share capital to institutional shareholders (i.e. banks and
insurance companies). These companies account for the total spinning capacity
in Egypt, two-thirds of the weaving capacity, about one-half of the knitting
production and one-third of the garments production. About 2.4 million cot-
ton spindles and 24,400 cotton looms were operated by the public sector enter-
prises in 1979. In addition, specialized public sector mills operated 74,000
wool spindles and 900 wool looms.
2.13      Private enterprises form an important part of the textile industry,
especially in weaving and garment making. It is estimated that about 16,200
power looms, 14,500 hand looms, 4,000 knitting machines as well as 3,800 hand
looms for rugs and carpets are operating in the private sector. The private
sector weaving enterprises are all small scale establishments with about 2 to
150 looms per establishment and an average of about 10 looms. There are 600
private firms with 25 or more employees and about 1,800 with less than 25
employees. But by the mid-1980's, the private sector is expected to account
for about 20% of spinning production and 50% of weaving output as the large
private sector projects and the proposed NSWC Project (para 2.26) which vill
become part of the private sector, reach full production.
E.   Organization of the Textile Industry
2.14      Until 1975, the operations of the public sector textile enterprises
were tightly controlled by the General Organization for Spinning and Weaving
(EGOSW) under the Ministry of Industry.  Since the abolishment of EGOSW and
other General Organizations, the public textile enterprises are linked directly



- 7 -
to the Ministry of Industry and Mining through the General Shareholders'
Assembly of each company, which is chaired by the Minister (or his representa-
tive). The General Organization for Industrialization (GOFI), the Technical
Secretariat for Textiles, the Consolidation Fund and tje Higher Council for
Textiles, all under the Ministry of /ndustry, have assumed some of the non-
operational fttctions of EGOSW. The current organization chart of the public
sector textile industry is shown in Annex 2-2.
2.15      The Higher Council -- a group of about 50 (individuals including
company chairmen, retired textile industry executives and representatives
of the Ministries of Finance, of Economy and of Industry -- is an institution
operating on an ad hoc basis, without support staff for analytical work, dis-
cussing textile industry issues and advising the Minister of Industry. GOFI's
textile industry department is responsible for project preparation, monitor-
ing of implementation, and for procurement in the public sector textile in-
dustry. The Technical Secretariat has assumed the functions of collecting
statistical data on the sector, determining yarn allocation quotas for the
private sector and establishing production targets -- especially with respect
to rationed cloth -- for the individual public sector textile enterprises.
Government control over the private textile enterprises is wielded in an
indirect way through licensing of investments and allocation of yarn produced
by the public sector firms. The Consolidation Fund provides assistance in
determining export prices and controlling quality of exported textile prod-
ucts. It also negotiates export quotas with convertible-currency countries
and participates in arranging bilateral trade agreements. However, the
Consolidation Fund does not assist the individual enterprises in promoting
exports to convertible currency countries.
2.16      Plant operation, marketing and pricing of non-rationed cloth, and
employment matters, which were previously controlled by EGOSW, are now to a
large extent performed by the management of individual enterprises within the
framework of existing policies and legislation. This represents an improve-
ment over the situation which existed before abolishment of EGOSW. In the
field of investment planning (para 2.24), however, the textile industry is
left without a coordinating body. Identification and preparation of projects
in the public textile industry are decentralized and are left with the indi-
vidual enterprises who submit their investment proposals to GOFI. But, while
GOFI performs the project monitoring and procurement assistance functions
adequately, it is not properly staffed to effectively perform the investment
planning function. Private foreign and joint venture investments on the other
hand, are licensed by the Ministry of Economy, which has responsibility for
projects in the free trade zones and for joint ventures with Arab and foreign
investors (falling under Law 43 of 1974). There are weaknesses in the organi-
zation of the textile industry, and it is necessary for the Government insti-
tutions involved to become more responsive to the development needs of this
industry. In this context, the Government and the Bank have already agreed
on the terms-of-reference for a study that will lead to an action program for
the development of the textile industry including training and institutional
aspects of the sector. The consultants for this study are expected to be
hired by October 1980 and will be financed from bilateral soft loans or grants
available to Egypt. The study will include prefeasibility studies for high
priority projects as well as a 5-year (1981-85) investment plan for the
textile industry and is expected to be completed by July 1981 (para 2.24).



-8-
F.   Issues and Problems of the Textile Industr
2.17      The public textile industry in Egypt faces a number of serious
problems which affect its present performance and future development prospects.
The key problem areas refer to the industry's low productive efficiency, its
poor financial situation, and the lack of an effective investment planning
and export promotion. During the appraisal of the first textile project
and in the textile sector study (para 1.04), these sectoral problems began
to be identified and analyzed. One major question in this regard is how to
plan and coordinate industrial development and review and analyze the problems
facing the various agencies involved in that process. It is for this reason
that the Government, within the context of the study referred to in para
2.16, agreed to study the function, responsibilities and procedures of the
textile sector and formulate an action program for the textile industry in-
cluding institutional aspects of the sector.
2.18      Efficiency and Training:  Current operational conditions in the
public sector industry are characterized by widespread underutilization of
capacity, deteriorated and obsolete equipment, over-employment in plants and
offices, and a low level of technical skill of the work force. As a result,
the product mix is not consistent with market requirements, the product
quality is generally poor, the waste level is relatively high and productivity
is low. As a first step to improve plant operation, a large number of workers
urgently need technical training to upgrade their skills, or re-training for
employment in areas where currently skilled labor is in short supply. At
present, most of the technical training is performed on the job; this has
shown limited results and also has contributed to the perpetuation of bad
industrial habits. There are a number of formal training programs in the
textile field in Governmental training centers which, however, have not
produced the quantity and quality of skilled labor required by the textile
industry. As part of the upgrading of eleven vocational training centers
under the Education II Credit (Cr. No. 868, 1979), the vocational training
program and course syllabi for training textile workers will be revised with
the assistance of representatives from the textile industry. But this work
does not, nor was it intended to, fully address the training needs of the
textile sector. The Government as part of an earlier Education I Credit (Cr.
No. 681-EGT, 1977) has almost completed a study on the manpower requirements
of various industries, including the textile industry. This will now be
followed by the preparation of a specific industry-wide training/retraining
program which the Government has agreed to prepare by July 1981 and to
subsequerntly implement on an agreed schedule.
2.19      The current difficulties faced by the public sector textile industry
in empLoyinng adequately skilled workers are exacerbated by Government-determined
gages and salaries which are not competitive with those paid by the private
sector  hi--hl pays two times more for skilled labor and up to four times more
for management personnel. This has induced qualified employees of the public
sector text±le firms to move to private enterprises or to look for less
deman-dng jobs ia other public sector firms which offer the same benefits.
The difficulties facing the public sector textile firms due to the wage
differentials are expected to get worse with the establishment of new private
sector textile firms, especially in the free trade zone areas. The public



-9-
enterprises located in Alexandria will be specially affected, as a large
integrated private text'le mill (the El Ameria project) is being built nearby.
2.20      The public sector companies are in theory free to design within
limits an incentive system for workers which could be adequate to attract
and retain a qualified work force. However, under the present lIw produc-
tion efficiency and serious over-staffing, the public textile industry cannot
support the financial implications of what initially is a costly incentive
system. Thus, to implement attractive compensation systems, the public sector
textile firms would need thd initial assistance and support of the Government.
2.21      Employment Policy:  Extreme over-staffing, mostly with unskilled
and semi-skilled workers which constitute roughly 60% of the total employment
in public sector textile enterprises, is a major financial burden which has
limited the enterprises from offering more attractive compensation packages
to their productive employees and has therefore also contributed to the low
productivity. The industry employs between four to five times more factory
workers and at least five times more administrative employees than enterprises
with comparable machinery and capacity operating in the US and EC countries,
while as noted, at the same time a shortage exists in certain categories of
skilled workers. The Government has recently abolished the quota system of
employment in public sector enterprises, but companies are still not allowed
to terminate unnecessary workers. The problem of over-staffing can, therefore,
only be solved over a longer period of time through attrition of superfluous
staff, training and re-training of the existing work force for productive
employment in new or rehabilitated plants.
2.22      Financial Situation:  The profitability of the public sector textile
industry has generally been satisfactory in spite of the substantial financial
burden on the companies, imposed by the Government policy of: (a) fixing ex-
factory prices of rationed cloth below production cost (para 3.08); and (b)
forcing substantial overemployment on the enterprises. But the industry has
suffered from a severe lack of financial resources needed for increasing work-
ing capital requirements, maintenance, rehabilitation and expansion of produc-
tion capacity because of a low profit retention rate. The combined financial
statements of the public sector textile firms are shown in Annexes 2-3 and 2-4
and the profit situation during the period 1973-1978 is summarized below:

- 10 -
Profits of the industry have been at an acceptable level during this period
of about 9.1% of sales and 5.8% of assets. However, there were substantial
variations among individual companies and a declining trend during 1977 and
1978 as interest expense increased from 1% of sales in the early 1970's to 4%
of sales by 1978 reflecting the increasing short-term borrowings of the com-
panies and the increase in interest rates in 1978 and 1979. During 1974,
profit levels reached a high of 11.5% of sales and 8.6% of assets. However,
that was an exceptional year for the textile industry when international
commodity prices, including textile prices, reached high levels and domestic
textile prices also increased, though not as dramatically as export prices.
The main reason for the lack of financial resources is the low retention rate
of profits. By law, 65% of before-tax profits are distributed to the Govern-
ment (and the remaining minority private shareholders), 20% to the workers'
participation fund and only 15% is retained by the enterprise on which it
has to pay a 40% income tax. This reduces further an enterprise's retained
profits, after taxes, to the equivalent of only 9% of the before-tax profits.
In practice, the Government may waive part or all of its share or the enter-
prise may withhold payment and incur an indebtedness. The public sector
textile companies have, therefore, been able to retain after taxes, an average
of 21% of before-tax profits during 1973 to 1976 and about 36% during 1977 and
1978; this was still not sufficient to maintain a financially strong position.
In the Bank's industrial projects, financial covenants are designed to safe-
guard the financial position of the project entities. But the Government
may have to re-examine the profit retention policy for all the public sector
enterprises as an industry-wide liquidity problem is already emerging. This
is being discussed with the Government within the continuing sector policy
dialogue (paras 2.04 and 2.17). -
2.23      The liquidity and capital structure of the Government textile enter-
prises has been deteriorating since 1973 (Annex 2-5). The combined current
ratio, which was stable at about 1.8 during 1968 to 1973 declined to 1.6 in
1975 and 1.3 in 1978 reflecting the increasingly difficult cashflow and
liquidity position of these enterprises as higher working capital and replace-
ment needs are more and more being financed with short-term debt rather than
by retained earnings. Between 1973 and 1978, the equity portion of capital
declined from 55% to only 41% and current liabilities increased from 28% to
44% of total capital employed, respectively. Also, the requirement to pur-
chase substantial quantities of long-term Government bonds--which was equiva-
lent to about 10% of total assets of the public textile enterprises during
1972-74 but fell to 4% by 1978--contributes to the weak liquidity position.
2.24      Investment Planning:  The present process of investment planning
in the textile industry is unsatisfactory and appears incapable of identi-
fying and preparing high priority projects in sufficient quantity to satisfy
the future domestic and export demand. Thus, while the textile sector survey
of April 1976 (para 1.04) suggested specific development objectives--in terms
of product mix, raw material (fiber) combinations, export orientation as well
as rehabilitation/expansion requirements which the Government supports--no
concrete steps have been taken towards preparing and defining the scope and
timing of specific projects. The preparation of a long term investment plan
is urgently needed. This plan should ensure balanced growth of capacity
between spinning, weaving and converting, as well as a more market oriented
mix of capacity between coarse, medium and fine yarns and fabrics. In addition,



- 11 -
spinning and weaving capacity has to be established based on an increasing use
of imported short-staple cotton and the availability of locally produced or
imported polyester fiber and market demand for polyester/cotton blends. The
textile sector survey estimates that about 50% of the existing textile equip-
ment in Egypt would have to be replaced over the next decade because of
obsolescence and to rectify the cumulative impact of past poor maintenance
practices. Ths installed cost of replacement investments together with the
cost of expanding the production capacity needed to maintain the balance
between forecast demand and supply during the next ten years are estimated at
about US$2.0 billion in 1980 prices. This amount would have to be increased
by US$0.9 billion should the industry's production efficiency remain at the
current low level thereby requiring a larger production capacity to meet the
expected demand. This substantial amount of money cannot be spent economi-
cally without an appropriate investment planning mechanism. The textile
industry study (para 2.16) is expected to identify an effective investment
planning function, which would establish and periodically update investment
plans for the textile sector.
2.25      The Government attaches high priority to the rehabilitation and
expansion of the public textile industry together with improvements in pro-
ductivity and product quality. To achieve maximum impact, resources available
for investment in the draft Five-Year Plan (1980-84) are concentrated on the
rehabilitation and modernization of the large public textile enterprises. The
Bank is supporting these objectives, since they represent the most effective
way to satisfy the need for increased and more productive capacity. Three of
the six largest enterprises, which account for about 50% of the capacity of
the public textile sector, are currently being rehabilitated and expanded:
Misr Mehalla, the largest public textile enterprise with 35,000 employees and
about 15% of public sector capacity and production is being rehabilitated and
expanded with financial assistance from the US Agency for International
Development; and KED and EB (para 1.04) are receiving assistance under the
Bank's first textile project. In addition, NSWC will be rehabilitated
under the proposed second Bank textile project. Finally, the rehabilitation/
modernization needs of other large public sector enterprises are expected to
be identified in the context of the study to be undertaken by the Government
which will develop an action program for the textile industry (para 2.16).
2.26      Investments in the private sector textile industry (excluding the
small-scale and artisan enterprises and the large El Ameria project mentioned
below) are currently almost exclusively in the context of joint ventures with
foreign investors and in recently established free trade zones. Ten joint
venture firms, mostly medium-scale garment manufacturers, are already in
operation; another seven are under execution and establishment of an additional
twelve private textile enterprises have recently been approved by the Govern-
ment (Annex 2-6). There are two large-scale private sector textile projects.
The first, which was completed in late 1979 is the Misr Iran Textile Company
(MIRATEX) spinning mill in the Suez Canal free trade zone built with financing
from Iran. Near Alexandria, a large-scale integrated textile mill (Misr El
Ameria) is under construction with a reported annual capacity of 300 million
square meters of polyester/cotton and 100% cotton fabrics. With the exception
of the MIRATEX and the Misr El Ameria projects, none of the other private
sector investments are in spinning or weaving but rather in knitting, garment-
making, finishing and carpet/rug-making which are not capital intensive. In
the case of weaving, the private sector was not allowed, until late 1979, to



- 12 -
import new looms because of a yarn shortage through most of the 1970's (except
1978 when a domestic surplus developed due to a fall in 1977 exports).
2927      Promotion of Textile Exports:  Export promotion for textile products
is currently carried out by the individual companies, with the Consolidation
Fund providing assistance in checking quality and negotiating quotas and
bilateral trade agreements. This will not be an adequate system for the
future when, due to the investment programs of major textile enterprises,
capacity will become increasingly available for the production of high quality
textiles including polyester/cotton blends which can be exported to convertible-
currency markets. These markets are more highly competitive and fashion
oriented than Egypt's traditional markets in Eastern Europe. To be successful
in Western export markets, systematic market and product research must be
developed and market ties must be established in major target markets. The
present decentralized system of export promotion is not capable of performing
this function effectively. But with the assistance of the International Trade
Center (ITC), the Government is now preparing a comprehensive export promotion
program. In this context, a ministerial level supreme council for foreign
trade and export promotion as well as a council for export promotion has just
been established.

Production of fabrics increased by about 3.0% per annum on average during the
1970's. Imports supplied only about 5% of apparent domestic consumption due
to the very high import duties (75% to 155%) while exports represented an
average of about 17% of domestic production during 1970-79. About 95% of
the local fabric production is 100% cotton material with synthetic and
blends accounting for 2% and woolen fabrics for 3% during this perioa.
3.02      Egypt's textile imports do not show any pattern of growth and
sizable increases in some years were done within the framework of bilateral
trade agreements. Exports, however, declined after the peak of 1970 as trade
relations with some eastern European countries deteriorated. Starting in
1975, however, exports started to improve somewhat and by 1979, fabric exports
were close to 80% of the 1970 level (para 3.11).
3.03      Apparent consumption of textiles in Egypt, not taking into account
change2 in stocks, increased at an average annual rate of 4.3%, from 654 mil-
lion m in 1970 to an estimated 963 million in 1979. However, consumption of
textiles per capita rose by only 2% per annum on averlge, as the population
grew by 2.3% per year during this period. At 23.5 m per capita, consumption
of cloth in Egypt is higher than in other countries of similar level of GDP
per capita. 1/ As discussed in para 3.08, the Government controls prices of
rationed cloth at a low level and has also maintained the cost of cotton,
including imported short-staple cotton used in the local textile mills below
world market prices. This has kept local textile prices below international
levels and thus induced a higher level of consumption of textiles than would
otherwise have been the case. But the cumulative impact of the textile price
increases in 1978 and in 1979 which raised local fabric 2/ prices to within
80% to 90% of international levels have kept per capita consumption unchanged
between these two years. However, by late 1979, inventories of fabrics, which
have increased significantly in 1978, were close to normal levels as demand
started to be strong again.

a/   This is the yarn utilized for the local fabric production shown in II-a(i).
In this forecast, production has been projected on the basis of an expected
modest improvement in efficiency and utilization of existing capacity.
Average I nnual production per loom in the public sector is currently about
26,500 m of cloth, as compared to an international standard of 38,000 m . If
effective programs of replacir.g obsolete equipment and training of machine
operators and mechanics as presently intended are undertaken, it should be
possible 2to raise production per loom over a .10-year period by almost 15% to
30,000 m , which would still be about 20% below the present international stan-
dard.  The for cast above assumes an improvement in annual productivity to only
about 27,800 m /loom since a major portion (47%) of the public sector looms
would still be obsolete (i.e., over 20 years old) by 1982, and unless the
financing constraints are overcome, only a very slow process of replacement
can be expected. In spinning, the present annual production is about 87.5 kg
of yarn per spindle compared to about 100 kg per spindle that would be possible
for the types of yarn produced and the equipment available. However, because
about 50% of the spindles in the country were supplied by one manufacturer,
and there are serious problems of supply of spare parts, and considering that
about 14% of the public sector spindles in 1982 will be over 20 years old,



- 15 -
the forecast assumes that the public sector spinning production will only
be about 90 kg of yarn annually per spindle0 Finally, the forecast assumes
that the proposed Project of NSWC will start production in early 1984 and
that the large joint-sector integrated project near Alexandria (She El Ameria
project) with a ca>,--Ity of 45,000 tpy of yarn and 300 million m  of fabric
annually will start production in 1983 at a production rate of 45% initially,
increasing to 75% in 1984 and 90% thereafter.
3.05      The domestic demand for textiles was projected by applying the
observed GDP-textile-demand elasticity 1/ of 0.56 during the period 1970-79
(Annex 3-1) and the estimate for the average growth of GDP during 1980-86 of
77 per year. The average projected increase of demand until 1986, as shown
in the above table, comes then to 3.9% per year, which is less than the 4.3%
experienced during 1970-79. During the period 1977-79, the GDP grew at about
8% annually and the Government's Draft Five-Year Plan (1980-84) has a target
GDP growth rate of 10% per year. However, with the slow-down in the economic
growth of the developed countries and the recent reduction in the rate of
growth of tourism receipts and remittances from Egyptians working abroad,
a range of 6% to 9% annual growth rate for GDP is probably more realistic.
For purposes of projecting fabric demand, a 7% average annual growth rate has
been assumed.
3.06      The table in para23.04 above shows that the domestic supply deficit
will be about 107 million m in 1982, turning into a very small surplus by 1984
and a minor deficit in 1986.  The proposed Project will reach full producti n
only in 1986. It will increase the supply of fabrics by about 17 million m
in 1986 and the incremental output is obviously insignificant compared to the
expected total production of about 1.4 billion m in that year. On the whole,
the deficit or surplus indicated for 1983 through 1986 is very small compared
to the total supply and demand and within the error range of the estimates.
It can be concluded, therefore, that the overall supply and demand situation
will be more or less in balance during 1983-86 and does not present any
unusual risk to the proposed NSWC Project.
C.   Marketing of Textiles in Egypt
3.07      Apart from small quantities of specialty imports, locally produced
cotton fabrics are distributed to two different domestic market segments: one
for low quality fabrics allocated as rations at subsidized prices and another
for non-rationed, higher quality, novelty fabrics. Approximately one-half of
the total fabric production is retailed by public sector firms and the other
one-half by private sector firms. However, almost 60% of the non-rationed
fabrics and only 45% of the rationed fabrics are distributed by public sector
retail stores (Annex 3-3).
3.08      Rationed Fabrics:  Recently, rationed fabrics represented about
26% of total fabric consueption; this presently gives to each Egyptian an
annual entitlement of 6 m of cloth at subsidized prices. Rationed fabrics are
supplied only by the public sector textile enterprises, and ex-factory prices,
1/   GDP at factor costs expressed in 1975 prices (million LE) and textile
apparent consumption in terms of million m of fabric equivalent.



16 
fabric width and fabric construction are determined by the Government. Cur-
rently, the average width of rationed fabrics is 80 cm, as compared to 115
cm for non-rationed cloth.  Until 1978, the ex-factory prices of rationed cloth
were fixed at between LE 0.1 and 0.2 per linear meter, which was about 40%
below production cost. The retail markup was only about 12%. The total
subsidy to the consumer involved in the supply of low priced rationed cloth
was about LE 20 million in 1976 of which LE 9 million was borne by the Govern-
ment (paying LE 0.03 per linear meter to the enterprises) and LE 11 million by
the public textile enterprises.   In 1979, however, the Government raised the
ex-factory price of rationed fabrics to equal the average production cost in
the industry but only raised the retail price by a small amount with the dif-
ference being borne by the Government directly. In order to allocate maximum
weaving capacity to the production of profitable non-rationed cloth, public
sector enterprises have been commissioning private weavers, on the basis of
reimbursement of cost plus profit margin, to produce ebout 40% of the total
rationed fabrics in recent years (about 100 million e /year). Rationed
fabric supply2has increased from about 149 million m  in 1970 to about
250 million m  in 1978 and an estimated 255 million in 1979, for an average
annual growth rate of 4.2% which is about the same as the growth rate of total
fabric consumption. Although rationed fabric production is planned to increase
to about 300 million m in 1980, the Government is also seriously considering a
gradual increase in retail prices to reduce the subsidy.
3.09      Non-Rationed Fabrics:  The market for non-rationed fabrics is sup-
plied from both public and private enterprises in the proportion of 74/26. 1/
In theory, this market is also regulated by the Government through the Indus-
trial Control Board of the Ministry of Industry which is supposed to determine
the fabric prices on the basis of fabric construction and cost data supplied
by the enterprises. In practice, however, the market for non-rationed fabrics
functions largely without Government regulation, as the Industrial Control
Board cannot physically monitor the large number of fabric constructions and
has discontinued to determine fabric prices.
D. Export Marketing of Textiles
3.10      While, as noted in para 2.06, the export of Egyptian raw cotton
declined in recent years, textile products have maintained their position
as a major earner of foreign currency. However, compared to exports of other
manufactured goods (excluding petroleum), textile products have performed only
modestly in export markets and their share of total manufactured exports has
declined from 60% in 1970 to 38% in 1976 but improved to an estimated 45% in
1979. 2/ New production capacity in the textile industry was mostly employed
to satisfy the growing domestic demand. Also, textile products are limited
to mostly 100% cotton materials and in addition, problems in producing high
quality fabrics and garments, have restricted textile exports largely to yarn
and grey fabrics, which have limited foreign markets. The export trend for
different textile products is given in the table below:
1/   All woolen/worsted fabrics are supplied by the public sector.  Knitted
fabrics are about equally supplied by the public and the private sectors.
2/   If petroleum products are included in manufactured exports, the share
of textile exports to total manufactured exports declined from 3.7% in
1974 to an estimated 19% in 1979.

a/   Others include knitted goods, garments, pile fabrics, household goods
and cotton wool.
b/   Starting February 1977, exports of textile products were based on the
parallel market foreign exchange rate of LE 0.69/US$1.00 compared to
the official rate of LE 0.40/US$1.00 which applied prior to that date.
3.11      Egypt's textile 1/ exports are mostly in the form of cotton yarn
which constituted about 60% (by weight as well as by value) of total textile
exports for the period 1970-79. Fabrics represented about 30% by weight (22%
by value) while all others, such as garments, knitted goods and household
items, accounted for the remaining 10% (18% by value). Yarn exports have
declined by almost 20% in terms of weight from about 43,300 tpy in 1970-73 to
an average of about 36,400 tpy in 1976-79. Similarly, fabric exports decreased
by about 40% in the same period. However, all other textile products together
increased by about 15% with the net result that total textile exports decreased
approximately 21% by weight from an average of 68,500 tpy to 56,400 tpy during
this interval. In terms of value, the average export price of textile products
increased roughly 41% in current terms, from about US$2,560/ton in the early
1970's to about US$3,620/ton in the late 1970's. 2/ Consequently, the total
value of textile exports increased from about US$176 million in 1972 to about
US$200 million in 1978 in spite of a decrease in export quantity from 69,000
tons to 55,000 tons. The decline in the quantity of textile exports can be
mostly explained by the continuous drop in exports to Eastern Europe. A com-
parison of the 1972 and the 1978 export markets (Annex 3-4), indicates that
exports to Eastern Europe decreased by about 12,000 tons of textile products
between 1972 and 1978 which is roughly comparable to the decline in total
textile exports. The estimated textile export quantity for 1979, which
represents an increase of 10% over the 1978 level, is encouraging. During
1979, Egypt's yarn and fabric bilateral trade agreements or export quotas in
the major markets were: USSR--17,000 tons; European Community--10,000 tons;
People's Republic of China--3,000 tons. The USA has not imposed a quota on
Egyptian exports since the quantities so far have been moderate (2,000 to
4,000 tons). To improve its textile export performance, Egypt must develop
strong market ties to both the North American market and the Western European
market in addition to maintaining the steady growth of exports to other Arab
and African countries.
I/   The term textiles includes yarn, fabrics, garments, knitted goods,
and household items (e.g., bedsheets, towels, etc.).
2/   In LE terms, the increase is about 250% from about LE 1,000/ton at the
official exchange rate to about LE 2,500/ton at the parallel foreign
exchange rate.

IV. PROJECT SPONSOR
A. The National Spinning and Weaving Company (NSWC)
4.01      NSWC, located in Alexandria, is the project sponsor.  The Company
was established in 1891 and nationalized in 1963 1/. It is the oldest textile
company in Egypt. Among the 30 public sector textile companies, it is the
sixth largest in terms of employment (15,000). However, because of obsolete
and inadequately maintained production facilities, a weak management and
insufficient skilled labor, NSWC has one of the lowest productivity levels and
the poorest financial performance record in the industry (paras 4.10-4.11).
In a way, NSWC embodies all the major problems facing the Egyptian textile
industry and the task of transforming the Company into an economically and
financially viable enterprise is both difficult and a challenge.
4.02      The organizational and managerial shortcomings of the Company are
therefore a serious risk for the Project given the magnitude and complexity
of these problems, and it is the Bank's primary and most critical role to
assist in the strengthening of the institution. To succeed in this, it is
necessary that the Company adopt personnel policies and a compensation system
adequate to attract and retain qualified personnel. But this is not possible
without a complete revision of the policies governing all public sector enter-
prises. On the other hand, it would take an indefinite time for NSWC itself
to be converted back to a private sector company thereby allowing it to adopt
such a compensation system. The Government and NSWC have therefore proposed
establishing a successor company with the Government, investment banks and
private investors as shareholders under Law 43 and this successor company will
then assume all the assets and liabilities of NSWC as well as operate all the
NSWC production facilities including those related to the Project. In this
way, the new company - as a private sector entity - will be free to design
personnel policies, job classifications and a compensation system as well as
pricing and profit retention policies needed to make the enterprise finan-
cially and economically successful. The Government and NSWC have agreed to
establish this successor company by March 31, 1981. To this end, a management,
organizational, and financial systems improvement program started in March
1980 with the assistance of foreign consultants (para 4.19); the program is
being partly financed from the technical assistance component of the Second
Industrial Import Loan (Loan No. 1456 EGT) with the major portion to be
financed from the proposed loan. The same foreign consultants will also
provide technical assistance during project implementation and commissioning
as part of the Project's objective. A permanent operator training program has
also been included in the Prcject to train/re-train workers for the existing
mills and the Project. Agreement was also obtained from the Company to
complete, by December 1980, specific plans for the training program and to
review this with the Bank.
B. Production Facilities
4.03      NSWC's existing production facilities are located on two sites,
Karmouz and Maharrem Bey, about 2 kms. apart, in the southern part of
1/   The Government owns 81% and the private sector 15% of the outstanding
shares of the Company; the balance is owned by local insurance companies
and banks, (2%) and the General Organization for Social Security (2%).

Alexandria (IBRD Map No. 13419). All cotton spinning mills (four) are located
at Karmouz while all weaving mills (also four), the knitting mill, the garments
plant and the converting plant are located at Maharrem Bey. The Karmouz site
is supplied with power by the public grid from a thermal station in Alexandria;
this power supply has been unreliable and inadequate, and has contributed to
the low productiv-'zy of the plant. Maharrem Bey is supplied with reliable and
sufficient power from the Aswan High Dam circuit. The Company's production
has seriously deteriorated (paras 4.04 to 4.06) during the last few years as
shown below:

C. Rehabilitation Requirements
4.04      The Company's present productivity level of about 60% of rated
spinning capacity and about 50% of weaving capacity 1/ is largely due to
the obsolete production facilities, although the low quality and quantity of
skilled labor and certain management weaknesses are also important factors.
The age of the equipment as of 1979 was as follows:

1/   The rated capacity has been adjusted downwards by 30% for spinning
and 20% for weaving relative to the international standards to reflect
the absence of air conditioning in NSWC's mills.

4.05      As the table indicates, an exception to the obsolete state of
production facilities appears to be the spinning equipment of which about 45%
is relatively new and which was installed less than 8 years ago. However,
the major portion of this machinery consists of spinning frames (spindles) of
inferior design and make with several technical production problems which are
compounded by lack of proper maintenance. The equipment has performed poorly
and is not expected to achieve any significant productivity improvements
as repeated attempts at adaptation have not proved successful. In addition,
the buildings for the spinning equipment are not air-conditioned as is generally
recommended in order to achieve higher production efficiencies and have only
the minimal humidifying system which however, in most instances, does not
work. The buildings are also multi-story, which is not ideal for the smooth
flow of materials, and are in poor physical condition. Furthermore, since the
waste percentage (para 4.07) of production from the spinning equipment is much
too high and the productivity too low, making these facilities uneconomic and
non-competitive, NSWC plans to scrap most of the spinning equipment within the
next 5 years or so. The Karmouz site is also within a residential area and
is no longer suitable for a large industrial facility.
4.06      Textile machinery, if properly maintained and operated, should
physically last 25 to 35 years. However, in NSCW's case, slightly more than
half of the weaving and converting machinery are already over 35 years old.
A study has shown that even a larger proportion of equipment will need to be
replaced within the next few years. For example, of the 1,700 weaving looms,
about 1,400 (82%) will need to be replaced by 1985. Similarly, the converting
plant consists mostly of very old equipment that has to be scrapped. In
addition, 80% of the converting capacity is for narrow fabrics (1 meter wide
or less) which is less than the present standard width of about 1.4 meters
for fabrics in international trade. There are no facilities for the applica-
tion of dimensional-stability finishes or wash and wear finishes, which is
incongruous considering the use of expensive print dyes. On the whole, the
converting plant operates at about 50% of international standards. Even
without the Project, NSWC would have to rehabilitate the converting plant in
1981, at an estimated cost of US$6 million, to maintain production at present
levels. This investment corresponds to about 50% of the cost of modernizing
the converting plant as provided in the Project to enable NSWC to finish
polyester/cotton blend fabrics as well.
D. Financial Performance
4.07      Several factors have eroded the profitability of the Company and
some of them have already been alluded to above. As a consequence of the poor
physical state of the plants and inadequate skilled workers, productivity is
low, the waste level is relatively high and the product quality is poor. The
following table compares the waste percentages of the existing mills (on the
basis of NSWC's product mix) with international standards and those expected
from the proposed Project.



- 21 -
NSWC - Production Waste Percentage a/
Existing Mills    International Standard   Proposed Proiect
Spinning Mills          26%                       15%                    10.4% b/
Weaving Mills             5%                       1.5%                   2.2%
Converting Plant          4%                       3%                     3.5%
a/   For spinning, the cotton waste (by weight) is given as percent of the total
cotton input. About 90% to 95% of the waste cotton is sold at about 60%
of the existing financial prices. For weaMing, the yarn waste (by weight)
and for converting, the fabric waste (by m ) Is given as a percent of the
yarn or fabric input respectively.
b/   The combined cotton and polyester waste is given as a percent of total
fiber input. This is not comparable to the international standard of 15%
which is for 100% cotton as the polyester waste percentage is much lower
than that for cotton (para 5.02).
With raw materials (fiber, chemicals, dyes, etc.) accounting for about 45% of
the Company's total productlon cost, these exceptionally high waste percentages
are untenable. The adverse economic effect of the high waste percentages is
even more severe than the financial impact since NSWC uses more long and
medium staple cotton (60% of total requirements) than necessary for its
product mix. Instead, about 75% of NSWC's cotton requirements could be met
by short-staple cotton. While the converting plant's waste percentage is
close to international standards, the quality of the finished fabrics is
generally poor, since no proper quality control is exercised. It is estimated
that if Western European or U.S. quality control norms were applied, less than
50% of the converting plants' output would pass such quality standards. While
such standards may not have much meaning for a market such as Egypt's, the low
level of product quality limits the selling price that the Company can charge,
thereby also contributing to the poor financial performance.
4.08      Because of Government employment policies, NSWC is also overstaffed
and is burdened with a large unskilled labor force. Ironically, the Company
is facing an acute shortage of skilled workers--especially weavers, spinners
and mechanics--which has adversely affected production. The negative impact
of this skilled labor shortage is further magnified by the high absenteeism
and turnover rates (especially in the skilled labor category), which run at
20% and 25% respectively at the Karmouz site and 12% and 15% at the Maharrem
Bey site. The low basic wage rate relative to alternative private sector
jobs, the unpleasant working conditions in the mills (especially at Karmouz)
relative to other industries in the Alexandria area such as pharmaceuticals,
the poor physical condition of the mills, the unprofitable performance of
NSWC and the absence of any prospects for improvement, all contribute to the
inability of the Company to attract and retain qualified personnel. Because
the difference between the unskilled labor wage rate and the skilled labor
wage rate is not large enough, there is also no incentive for the non-working
labor force to acquire skills and to work in a productive capacity.
4.09      Finally, NSWC's quota for the production of rationed fabrics is fairly
high relative to its capacity to absorb losses. Although actual rationed fabric
production averaged only 16.5 million lmpy during 1978-79 1/ compared to the
1/   The rationed fabric production of NSWC averaged 13 million lmpy during
1974-77.



- 22 -
Company's quota of 19 million Impy, it still accounted for 59% of NSWC's
fabric output. This is higher than the 40% average for all Egyptian public
sector textile firms and is a heavy financial burden.
4.10      The Company's historical financial statements are shown in Annexes
4-1 and 4-2 and summarized on the following page together with the projected
financial position under the assumption that NSWC will not have any major
capital investment program (i.e. without the Project). To see the Company's
financial performance in the proper context, it must be noted that all textile
companies did very well in 1974 (para 2.22). NSWC achieved in 1974 a profit
of LE 1.2 million, or about 6% of sales revenue. Since that time, however,
the Company's product prices have either stabilized or only improved moder-
ately, while production costs have continued to rise. Consequently, the
Company's profitability has kept declining, reaching a break-even level in
1976 and turning into small losses in 1977 and 1978. The estimate for 1979
indicates a very large loss of about LE 5.3 million unless the Government
retroactively provides some subsidies.
4.11      NSWC's financial performance is one of the poorest among the 30
public sector textile companies. During the period 1974-78, these companies,
as a group, earned net incomes (after taxes) corresponding to about 9% of
sales revenue (as compared to 1% for NSWC) and had a combined current ratio
of 1.7 in 1974 (1.0 for NSWC) but which had declined to 1.3 by 1978 (still
1.0 for NSWC), reflecting the increasingly difficult cashflow and liquidity
position for these enterprises (paras 2.22 and 2.23). In the case of NSWC,
short term debt accounted for slightly more than half of the current liabili-
ties. To improve NSWC's liquidity position, the Government provided additional
equity contributions of about LE 2.4 million in 1977 and LE 3.5 million in
1978. While these have prevented an otherwise untenable liquidity problem and
kept the Company afloat, only a major rehabilitation program together with
changes in the Company management and operating policies and procedures can
turn the Company around towards profitability.
4.12      The Company's future financial prospects have been analyzed under
the assumption that the Project would not be proceeding. For this analysis,
the three following important assumptions are made: (a) the obsolete equip-
ment that is intended to be scrapped as part of the Project will be kept in
operation for two more years than provided in the Project 1/; (b) rationed
fabrics will be reduced to 35% of the Company's total fabric production,
implying a declining rationed fabric production as total fabric production is
expected to peak at 29 million lmpy (excluding commission weaving of 5 to 6
million lmpy) during 1980 and gradually decline thereafter; and (c) commission
finishing will increase up to 20 million lmpy as NSWC's fabric production
decreases to keep the converting plant output between 30 and 40 million lmpy.
The financial forecast without the Project (Annexes 4-6 to 4-8) focuses on the
period 1980-84 which is critical to the corporate capital investment plans of
the Company.
1/   For comparative purposes, Annexes 4-3,and 4-4, show the number of oper-
ating spindles and looms together with their average respective produc-
tivities for two cases: (i) without the Project; and (ii) with the
Project. NSWC production without the Project is shown in Annex 4-5.

- 24 -
4.13       The previous talblle indicates that the Company's longer term finan-
cial prospects are not encouragina. During the next five years (1980-84)
losses are predicted at an increasing rate as obsolete equipment must eventu-
ally b£ scrapped.  In addition to the problems mentioned in paras 4.07 to 4.09
above, thi.s negative trend is primarily due to declining productivity in the
spinning mills and the scrapping of some spinning machinery starting in 1980
and some weaving equipment starting in 1981 (Annex 4-3 and 4-4). Because the
Company is not expected to generate any investable funds in the future, the
miodernization of the converting plant in 1980-81 (para 4.06) which is necessary
even without the proposed Project, is assumed to be financed with a long-term
loan of LE 4.8 million. The impact of the deteriorating machinery and the
scrapping of substantial equipment clearly becomes untenable after 1982, and
signals an urgent need for corrective action.
E.   NSWC Rebabilitation and Expansion Program (REP)
4.14      With the assistance of foreign consultants (Werner International-USA)
financed through the Bank Group's Agricultural and Industrial Imports Project
(Credit No. 524-EGT and Loan No. 1062-EGT) of December 1974, NSWC in 1977
developed a ten-year (1978-87) Rehabilitation and Expansion Program (REP)
with a view to restoring the competitiveness and financial viability of the
Company. The need for such a program was identified in the textile sector
survey (para 1.04).
4.15      After the proposed REP was reviewed and its first phase appraised by
the Bank as a possible project in October 1977, a large private sector project
(the El Ameria project) sponsored by the Bank Misr, a major public sector
bank, was also confirmed to be planned for implementation concurrently with
the proposed NSWC project. To determine the appropriate capacity of the El
Ameria Project, the Government undertook a review of the future textile supply
and demand situation as well as the investment plans in the industry to ensure
that a serious over-capacity situation does not develop which would endanger
the economic viability of all textile projects in Egypt. The Government
review was completed in August 1979 when the El Ameria project was granted an
industrial license with a capacity of about 45,000 tpy of yarn and 300 million
of m of fabric per year.
4.16      The Bank then undertook in October and November 1979 a re-appraisal
of the REP including an evaluation of the market impact of the El Ameria
proJect sccpe as well as the other rehabilitation and modernization projects
in the sector to ascertain the most appropriate product mix and scope for
NSWC's modernization project as well as the market risks the project would
face.  This evaluation, which was done jointly with NSWC management, led to
a revision of the REP into a single phase (the proposed Project) at a lower
final capacity and a product mix with a higher proportion of polyester/cotton
blend yarns and a smaller proportion of wide fabrics for sheeting. The
following table shows the overall changes in NSWC's production after completion
of the proposed Prolect:

f/   Including commission finishing of 10 to 15 million lmpy.
F.   Organizational Improvement and Training
4.17      The existing organizational structure of NSWC is shown in Annex 4-9.
The Chairman and President, Mr. Mohamed Salama Ismail, was appointed to the
position in 1974. He reports to the General Shareholders Assembly, which is
chaired by the Minister of Industry and Mining. The assembly meets semi-
annually and approves the Company budget, investment plans and general
operating policies. The assembly is dominated by Government representatives
and in practice, the Minister exercises significant control or influence
in the operations of the enterprise. The Company has an advisory board of
directors, consisting of four representatives each from management and from
labor, and one representative from the minority private shareholders.
4.18      As mentioned previously, NSWC is organizationally weak.  Apart
from the Chairman, there are a few qualified management personnel in the
Company, but not enough to make an adequate impact in its operation. The



- 26 -
organizational structure partly reflects this shortage of management resource;
for example, the span of control of the production general manager is too
broad, having seven major operating units reporting to him. The three key
operating management positions, the commercial general manager, the production
manager and the financial manager are particularly weak. The lack of manage-
ment talent is further compounded by non-existing or ineffective management
planning and control systems.
4.19      An improvement in the organizational and labor efficiency of NSWC
must therefore accompany the physical rehabilitation and modernization Project
if the Company is to realize the potential return from its capital investments.
Otherwise, the new facilities will, in a very short time deteriorate to a
similar condition as the present mills. NSWC has therefore engaged GHERZI
Textil Organisation (Switzerland) and in addition, will also hire by October
1980 an accounting firm to assist in the development and implementation of an
organizational, management, and financial system improvement program, including
training of management and administrative staff. In general, the objective of
the program is to adopt the Company's organizational structure and its manage-
ment, planning and control, as well as accounting systems to the needs of a
modern and large scale private sector textile operation. The program will
include the development of (a) a new organizational structure suited to the
Company's expanded operations including job descriptions for key positions;
(b) a management training and development program; (c) a management reporting
system; (d) a financial planning and control system; (e) a production costing
system; (f) a review/revision of the compensation and benefits package,
including the production bonus system; (g) a ten-year manpower plan for both
administrative and production workers covering attrition, retirement, reassign-
ment, recruitment, and training to achieve a smooth transition during the
relocation out of the Karmouz site and from an overstaffed to an efficiently
staffed company; (h) a production planning system; and (i) improvements in
the coordination/ communication functions needed to have a modern, large-scale
textile company that can come close to international levels of efficiency.
The organizational improvement program will start in March 1980, and last for
about two years. The Company will provide a counterpart team to work with the
consultants (para 5.17). In addition, NSWC has agreed that the top operating
management of the Company will be promptly strengthened after the successor
company to NSWC has been established under Law 43.
4.20      The technical and financial consultants, while providing a very
important service, are not substitutes for the Company's own management staff
and cannot, by themselves, be expected to implement and initially operate the
Project successfully. The implementation and subsequent operation of the
proposed Project will only be successful if the Company is able to attract and
retain sufficient qualified management and factory personnel. Agreement was
therefore reached with the Government and with NSWC that the Company, in close
cooperation with the Government, will design by December 31, 1980, for review
and comment by the Bank and implement promptly after the successor company has
been established (para 4.02) a compensation/benefits package (including bonus
system) for its operating and management staff that will, under conditions of
efficient operation, be adequate to attract and retain qualified personnel.
There is one practical problem that must be overcome concerning this cove-
nant. It concerns the scope of application of the new compensation package.
The new compensation system may have to be initially restricted to



- 27 -
the management personnel and introduced at the operating level in the existing
facilities at the same time as the new mills start production in 1984. This
is so because of the heavy financial burden that such a system will impose if
immediately applied on a Company-wide basis, given the serious over-staffing
and low profitability of the existing production facilities. This is the
assumption usee in the financial analysis of NSWC with the Project (Chapter VII).
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Concept, Scope and Location
5.01      The Project is designed to produce high-quality medium count type of
fabrics. This product mix will complement the present expansion programs of
other public sector firms, such as KED (para 1.05) and Mehalla (para 2.24),
which are designed to produce fine and very fine count fabrics for the local
and export markets. The Project will increase the Company's output of fabrics
from about 27 million to about 35 million lmpy and terry towels from about 445
tpy to 975 tpy. A small portion, some 10% (by weight) of NSWC's total output
after the Project, consisting in about equal parts of fabrics and bedsheet
sets 1/ and a small quantity of terry towels , is intended for exports pri-
marily to convertible currency countries, even though the domestic market will
be able to absorb the entire NSWC production after the Project is completed.
The exports will also help to earn the foreign exchange to pay, directly or
indirectly, for part of the Project's raw material imports (i.e. short-staple
cotton and dyestuffs). Exporting will also expose NSWC to the discipline of
international competition, and improve the Company's profitability, as profit
margins on exports are expected to be slightly higher than those on local
sales.
5.02      Cotton products (i.e. 100% cotton) will account for about 50% of the
production by weight but only 18% of the Company's total revenue after the
Project reaches full production (1986); the major portion of the revenue will
be derived from polyester/cotton blends. For purposes of project appraisal
and analysis, two polyester/cotton blend combinations have been used - 65/35
and 50/50. Blended fabrics have gained worldwide acceptance and popularity.
The reasons are: (a) a lower waste factor for man-made fibers, about 6% for
polyester, in the spinning operation compared to about 10% (for carded yarn)
to 30% (for combed yarn) for cotton; (b) the longer wear-life, from two to
three times, of blended fabrics compared to 100% cotton fabrics, and (d) the
easy-care and anti-crease properties of clothing made from blended fabrics
which apart from their economic justifications have great consumer appeal in
Egypt. Should the demand for the Project's polyester/cotton products be much
more than presently envisaged, the Project has the flexibility, with some
small investments, to shift its polyester/cotton yarn production from 52% to
about 70% of total NSWC yarn output.
5.03      A major portion of the textile market in Egypt are sheeting fabrics
for bedsheets and pillow cases, where the trend to printed and wide sheets is
1/   The bedsheet sets will be of two types:  (a) two sheets and two pillow
covers per set, and (b) two sheets and four pillow covers per set.

fairly well established. Thus, about 19% of the fabric output of the Project
will be wide (1.5 to 2.8 meters) sheeting fabrics, all made of 50/50 polyester/
cotton blends; about 46% will be shirting/dress fabrics (1.2 meters wide) made
of 65/35 polyester/cotton blends; about 27% will be rationed fabrics (100%
cotton); and the remaining 8% will be fabrics for household articles (e.g.
tablecloths) made of 50/50 polyester/cotton.  In addition 2to the fabric
output, the Project will also produce about 2.7 million m /year (975 tpy) of
terry towels (100% cotton) from the rehabilitated mills. All of the yarn
output of the new spinning mill will be used for the Project's own weaving
operation. In addition to the yarn for weaving (6,083 tpy), the new spinning
mill will also produce 500 tpy of 100% cotton sewing thread. The remaining
spinning mill at Karmouz (mill No. 3) will provide the balance (1,999 tpy) of
100% cotton yarn needed by NSWC to be used for commission weaving of rationed
cloth and terry towel production.
5.04      The components of the Project are as follows:
(a) Installation of a new 6,600 tpy (production basis) spinning mill
with about 73,000 spindles at Mallaha, near the existing facilities
at Maharrem Bey. Included in the 73,000 are about 48,000 rehabilitated
spindles from Karmouz. About 52,000 spindles at Karmouz will be
scrapped;
(b) Installation of a new polyester/cotton weaving mill to produce
19.6 million lmpy (production basis) with about 768 looms adjacent
to the new spinning mill; closing of two weaving mills (No. 2 and 3)
by eliminating 1,100 obsolete looms; airconditioning and upgrading
of weaving mill No. 4 which contains 300 looms in relatively good
condition thereby permitting production of polyester/cotton blends
and slightly increasing its production from 6.0 to 6.7 million lmpy;
and some minor rehabilitation of weaving mill No. 1;
(c) Modernization of the existing converting plant at Maharrem Bey to
process wide fabrics and polyester/cotton blends including the
installation of effluent treatment facilities;
(d) Reorganization of the garment-making unit (to make only institutional
types of garments) and the towel-making unit, including the produc-
tion and marketing procedures; installation of a new bedsheet-making
unit of 0.65 million sets per year; and sale of all existing knitting
machines;
(e) Erection of mill management and supervisory staff housing (60 dwelling
units);
(i;) Technical assistance for project implementation; establishment of
a training program including training abroad of NSWC staff (para
4.02); and
(g)  Sector studies and training (paras 2.16 and 2.18).

addu-&i:*ai converting capacity of from 10 to 15 million lmpy will be used

for commission finishing for which there is a growing demand in the country.
Until 1977, NSWC processed 5 to 6 million Impy on a commission basis but the
quantity increased to 12 million meters in 1978 and almost 15 million meters
in 1979. The small expansion of the converting plant has been combined with
the modernization to take advantage of economies of scale.
5.06      Several alternative project sites, all within 25 kms of the city
of Alexandria, were considered as possible location for the new spinning and
weaving mills. The sites evaluated all have ample power supply from the Aswan
High Dam circuit and adequate fresh water supply from the Alexandria water
system. The main selection criteria were the availability of a large con-
tigous tract to provide space for future expansion and the price of land.
The industrial land (100 acres) already owned by NSWC at Mallaha, which on
one side is along a major highway and on the opposite side is separated from
NSWC's Maharrem Bey mills only by a 30-meter railroad right-of-way and which
is presently used for open storage of cotton, was finally selected as it
will also provide for better coordination and management of the entire NSWC
operations.
B.   Project Technology
5.07      The technologies presently available for a textile mill can be
grouped under three main categories: (a) pre-conventional technology (PCT)
based on narrow mechanical looms and direct spinning; (b) conventional tech-
nology (CT) based on broad automatic shuttle looms, and ring spindles; and
(c) advanced technology (AT) based on labor-saving devices such as automatic
opening in blow rooms, chute-fed high-speed cards, single-process drawing in
tandem with carding, open-end spinning, unifils and electronically-operated
shuttleless looms which are increasingly introduced in developed countries
in the face of sharp increases in labor costs. The PCT technology has become
outdated because of: (a) very slow machine speed; (b) higher capital and
operating costs than for CT machines to produce a given quantity of fabrics
in a given time; and (c) lack of machine versatility to produce fine fabrics.
Further, the use of the PCT technology requires high skilled operators. The
various technologies available have been examined in detail with respect to
costs and benefits before recommending the appropriate technology for Egyptian
conditions. For the proposed Project, modern but conventional technology (CT)
will be used for the spinning and weaving mills--the main units of the Project
accounting for about 60% of the installed cost of the Project. As for the
converting plant the latest processing technology has been chosen to ensure
high product quality and also to economize on the use of water, fuel, dyestuffs
and chemicals. The use of this technology at the converting plant is not
oriented towards saving on labor cost. Nevertheless were less advanced
technology to be employed, the converting plant would require hardly any
additional employees. Almost all (98%) spinning, weaving, converting and
service equipment has to be imported because these are not produced in Egypt.
C.   Buildings
2
5.08      A covered floor space of about 50,600 m , of area2is provided to
house the new spinning and weaving mills, including 3,400 m for storage
areas. The floor space is in lije with norms accepted in the textile industry,
i.e. 0.4 m per spindle and 25 m per loom plus storage and service areas.



- 30 -
Workshop and office facilities (3,350 m2 of 5loor area) will also be provided
in the new site. In addition, about 2,400 m of floor space will be added to
the existing converting plant at Maharrem Bey for the boiler house, and for
the water and effluent treatment facilities. All factory buildings are to be
of prefabricated s       frame structures to reduce the time of civil works
erection and avoid the problems associated with the cement shortage in the
country. For technical and quality reasons, about 70X of the area in the new
spinning and weaving mills will be airconditioned. Furthermore, the spinning
mill will have an overhead air-exhaust system and the carding room an addi-
tional floor waste filter exhaust to improve yarn quality as well as working
conditions. The Government has agreed to give the Project high priority
regarding the availability of construction materials and supplies so that
implementation can proceed according to schedule.
D.   Ecological Considerations and Occupational Hazards
5.09      As the output of the facilities at the new mills will be only yarn
and grey fabrics, no water and air pollution problems are expected. The new
spinning and weaving facilities will be equipped with air filters to control
fibers and dust being exhaused into the atmosphere; humidity and temperature
will be controlled for technical reasons but at the same time to create better
working conditions. Carding machines will be equipped with floor waste
exhaust filters and the dust will be kept below 0.5 mg/m . Also, the design
of the buildings will allow the noise level in the spinning and weaving mills
to be kept below 95 and 100 DBA 1/ respectively; in addition, the operators
will be required to wear ear plugs in the working areas and insulated booths
will be provided where the operators can go when not attending to the machines.
5.10      There will be no air-conditioning in the converting plant at Maharrem
Bey but all departments generating heat and/or steam will be equipped with spe-
cial hoods with forced exhaust systems to lower the temperature in the working
areas.  As the effluent of the converting plant is likely to be alkaline and
its biological oxygen demand (BOD) at the assumed production level is esti-
mated at about two tons per day, and thus exceeds Icceptable standards, an
effluent  treatment plant with a capacity of 300 m /hour is provided under
the Project; as a consequence the treated effluent discharged to the municipal
sewer system will have a 6 to 8 pH and a BOD below 100 PPM.
5.11      The boilers will be operated on heavy fuel oil and will be equipped
with automatic regulatory devices to ensure maximum combustion so that the
boiler flue gases will contain no carbon monoxide. The design of the chimneys
will also keep the a erage sulphur dioxide content of the air on the ground
level below 0.1 mg/m . The above precautions are considered acceptable and
the Company has agreed to install these facilities and properly maintain
and operate them.
E.   Production Program, Raw Materials and Utilities
5.12      The product mix and production program of NSWC after the Project is
completed are shown in Annexes 5-1 and 5-2.
1/   Decibels.



- 31 -
The production is based on 7,200 hours per year of operation and a weighted
average of 80% production efficiency 1/; this is achievable, not only since
the international norms are over 90% but also because the better run mills
in Egypt have attained continuously 85% to 88% production efficiency rates
in recent years. With the assistance of the technical consultants and the
establishment of the operator and maintenance labor training program (para
5.19), and the provision of temperature and humidity control (airconditioning)
facilities for optimum results, the Project facilities are expected to be able
to achieve 80% production efficiency reasonably soon and eventually operate at
85%. But considering the present situation in the Company, a level of 80%
throughout has been used in the financial and economic analysis.
5.13      The main raw materials for the Project are cotton, polyester, dye-
stuffs and chemicals. Egypt, as previously noted, does not produce short-
staple cotton, which constitutes 81% of the Project's cotton requirement and
will therefore be  imported.  The other 19% of the Project's cotton require-
ments will be the medium to long staple variety (1-3/16 to 1-6/16 inches)
grown in Egypt, such as the Ashmouni and GIZA 66 varieties (1-3/16 to 1-4/16
inches) or the GIZA 67 and GIZA 69 varieties (1-5/16 to 1-6/16 inches). For
purposes of the economic analysis, it is assumed that the GIZA 69 variety
which is the most expensive of the four, will be used. Polyester will be
locally supplied with the recent start-up of a 25,000 tpy public sector
polyester plant near Alexandria. Finally, about 75% of the required chemicals
and dyestuffs will be imported with the remainder procured locally. The
Government will ensure that the Project will have access to all the raw
materials and supplies, including the foreign exchange necessary to acquire
such materials, needed for the efficient operation of the project facilities.
5.14      NSWC's annual consumption of fiber (Annex 5-3) and utilities when the
Project reaches full production are summarized below and also given in detail
in the financial annexes:

- 32 -
5.15      As Maharrem Bey and Mallaha are supplied with power from the Aswan
High Dam circuit, no supply problems are anticipated. The new mills will be
provided with six 1.5 MW transformers and two 2-ton per hour (tph) boilers.
In addition, three 15-tph boilers will be erected at Maharrem Bey to meet the
steam requirements of the converting plant. Additional water filtratL n and
treatment facilities will also be installed at Maharrem Bey, which is supplied
with water from the Alexandria city system. All the above facilities will be
provided under the Project and financed under it. The Government will also
ensure that the Project will be supplied with all the required power and water.
F.   Project Implementation, Staffing and Training
5.16      The project implementation period covers 48 months starting March
1980 with the hiring of the technical consultants and commercial operation is
expected to commence in April 1984 after four months of commissioning. The
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 5-4; it allows for 43 months for
completion of civil works, including 10 months for civil design and inter-
national tendering of the main civil works contract 1/ and 33 months for
actual construction. Due to a shortage of local building contractors and
severe delays in civil works experienced in most of the Bank's projects
in Egypt, the Project's main civil works contract will be bid as a single-
responsibility contract subject to international competitive bidding and Bank
financing of US$10.4 million representing about 74% of the estimated cost
of the main civil works contract is included in the Project for this purpose.
In awarding the civil works contract a particular premium will be placed on
speedy contract execution and on the degree of reliability with which such
execution can be achieved. The architectural and building design services will
also be provided by GHERZI and financed by the Bank. With the above measures
it is hoped that the 43 months period allowed for completion of civil works
can be adhered to and possibly be improved upon. If-so, the Project can start
commercial operation earlier by the time saved in civil works construction.
5.17      It is recognized that because of the weaknesses in NSWC's technical
management, the Project can only be implemented with extensive external con-
sultancy assistance and with the recruitment of new technical staff with suit-
able qualifications. NSWC has therefore engaged foreign technical consultants
on terms and conditions agreed with the Bank (GHERZI Textil Organisation -
Switzerland) and will also hire by October 1980, accounting consultants. The
consultants will provide assistance in three main areas: (a) management and
organizational improvement, discussed in para 4.19; (b) project implementation,
start-up and technical training, discussed below; and (c) financial and
accounting systems. In addition, NSWC has already constituted two teams to
work with the consultants: (a) an organizational and financial systems im-
provement counterpart team; and (b) a project implementation unit (PIU),
1/   The main civil work contract will cover about 50,600 m  of area for  2
the new spinning and weaving mills (including stora e area of 3,400 m>)
It does not include general plint services (2,400 m ); administration
and social facilities (4,150 m ); housing facilities (4,100 m ); and site
piling and improvements (fences, roads, etc.).



- 3j -
staffed with technical personnel. The staffing of the two teams is shown
in Annex 5-5. NSWC has already hired an experienced and qualified textile
engineer, Mr. Ghorab, who has worked for a foreign consulting firm in imple-
menting and operating textile projects in Africa, as project manager and head
-f`-the PIU.  The Company will ensure that the PIU and the counterpart team
will continue to be fully staffed with qualified personneI.
5.18      The financial and accounting consultancy services is estimated to
involve about 45 man-months. The terms-of-reference as well as the firms
invited to submit proposals for the financial and accountancy services have
been agreed upon between NSWC and the Bank. The accounting consultant is
expected to be hired by October 1980. The technical consultancy services will
involve about 220 man-months starting March 1980. and will cover three main
areas:  (a) Assistance in constructing and commissioning the project facil-
ities; (b) Assistance in reorganizing the Company's existing garments opera-
tions and its marketing organization including the establishment of an export
marketing group; and (c) Assistance in designing and implementing the organi-
zational and management improvement program described in para 4.19. For the
first two areas, that is (a) and (b) above, the scope of work will cover:
(i) Architectural and building design; (ii) Review of plant design and machin-
ery specifications; (iii) Assistance in the preparation of tender documents
for the main civil works contract, bid evaluation and supervision of the main
civil works contractor; (iv) Assistance in the preparation of tender documents
for plant equipment and evaluation of bids; (v) Assistance in developing
production plans, work assignments, operations and maintenance standards and
procedures, as well as quality standards and control systems; (vi) Development
and implementation of a training program for plant workers and supervisors,
including arrangements for foreign training and technical education of produc-
tion management and supervisory personnel; (vii) Assistance in the development
and operation of a project monitoring and control system including the prepara-
?Ion of a project reporting system satisfactory to the Company management and
the Bank; and (viii) Assistance in the inspection of erected equipment,
start-up and initial operations.
5.19      The training of skilled workers as well as plant supervisors are
critical activities that the consultants will program and monitor. Some
foreign technical training will be needed, mostly in the facilities of the
major equipment (spinning and weaving) suppliers and the foreign exchange
cost of this technical training component is included in the project cost.
Total employment for the new spinning and weaving mills, roughly one-third
of which is expected to be transfers from the existing mills at Karmouz,
is estimated at 2,000 persons, on the basis of a staffing schedule that is
considered efficient under Egyptian conditions although it still assumes 50%
of the labor productivity level of US or European mills using similar equip-
ment. For the new mills, the investment cost (excluding interest during
construction) per job is about US$35,000. The modernized converting plant
and the bedsheets plant however, will not require new staff as the required
personnel (about 750 persons) will be drawn from the existing labor force.
NSWC has agreed that it will staff the Project's facilities (e.g., the new
spinning and weaving mills) in a manner acceptable to the Bank (Annex 5-5).

VI. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCURENENT
A.   Capital Cost
6.01      Total financing required for the Project is estimated at US$104 mil-
lion equivalent (LE 72 million) of which US$79 million (LE 55 million) is in
foreign exchange. The capital cost estimate is based on prices at the end
of 1979. The total financing required (including proportional allocations of
technical assistance and training, physical contingencies, price escalation,
incremental working capital and interest during construction) is approximately
allocated among the various project components as follows: (a) the new
spinning mill--US$48 million (46%); (b) the new weaving mill--US$37 million
(35%); (c) the modernized converting plant--US$15 million (14%); and (d) the
rehabilitated weaving mills and the new bedsheet plant--US$4 million (4%).
Details of the cost estimate and the assumptions used are given in Annexes 6-1
and 6-2 and are summarized in the following page.
6.02      The equipment costs have been derived from the equipment list and
cost estimates prepared by NSWC and reviewed by the Bank based on the results
of the ongoing procurement for other textile projects. The Project is exempt
from import duties but will pay a general import tax of 5% of the CIF value of
imported equipment. The estimated total cost of both the engineering and
financial consultancy services is about US$2.9 million. The engineering
consultancy services of about 220 man-months will be provided by GHERZI (para.
5.17) at an average man-month cost of US$11,000 including salary, costs, fees,
international travel and subsistence. The financial consultancy services,
which will be contracted for by October 1980, is estimated to require 45
man-months at an average man-month cost of about US$10,200. The cost of the
civil works have been estimated on the basis of the construction cost of the
first textile project currently under implementation as well as other Bank
assisted projects in Egypt including adjustments for the type of construction
and the international pro urement.  The civil works base cost es5imate comes
to an average of US$275/m  for the production areas and US$145/m  for non-
production areas.
6.03      Price escalation for equipment is calculated on the basis of pro-
jected international equipment price increases of 10.5% in 1980, 9.0% in 1981,
8.0% in 1982 and 7.0% annually during 1983-85 in major equipment supplying
countries. The same price inflation rates have also been used for about US$7
million (BCE basis) worth of services and local supplies (except civil works)
on the assumption that price escalation on these items will follow the rates
in those countries. On civil works however, a price escalation rate of 12%
in 1980, 10% in 1981, 9%, in 1982 and 8% in 1983 has been assumed, based on
experience in the recent past and the expectation that the cost of civil works
in Egypt will continue to rise faster than the international price level. The
above cost estimate, including the provisions for physical and price contin-
gencies is considered adequate.

all in local currency, is estimated at US$8 million equivalent (Annex 6-3).
Interest during construction is calculated on the basis of total debt financing
of US$69 million, approximately covering 87% of the foreign exchange cost of
the Project, i.e. excluding interest during construction. This level of debt
financing corresponds to 66% of the total project cost and is relatively high.
However, the Company as a whole is projected to have a debt/equity ratio of
60:40 or better after the first full year of operation of the Project (1986)
although the ratio could be as high as 64:36 during some stages of project
implementation (para 7.07). The proportion of debt financing is therefore
acceptable. The calculation of the interest during construction is shown in
Annex 6-4.
B.   Financing Plan
6.05      The financing plan for the Project is as follows:

Total Financing                          72.0            104.3      100
a/   The Ministry of Industry has already included this amount in
its investment budget for 1980-83.
b/   The Government already provided this loan to NSWC from the
Bank's Second Industrial Import Loan (Ln. No. 1456-EGT) to
finance the downpayment for the consultancy services.
The above equity funds of about US$35 million (LE 24 million) will be provided
by the Government from budgetary allocations and by private shareholders. In
addition, since the Company is expected to experience cash deficits from
operations during project implementation (para 4.13), the Government will
provide or cause NSWC to be provided with additional equity funds to cover
such deficits. This obligation is to improve the Company's current ratio (or
at least keep it from deteriorating further) during project implementation and
ensure that the funds provided for the Project under the above financing plan
are not diverted to cover NSWC's operating deficits. The additional equity
requirements are estimated at about LE 2 million in 1980 and LE 4 million per
year during 1981-83 (para. 7.07). The Bank loan of US$69 million equivalent,
will be made to the Government for 15 years, including 4.5 years of grace at
the standard interest rate. The loan will be onlent to the Company on the
same terms and at an annual interest rate of 10%. The Company will bear the
foreign exchange risk for the Bank loan proceeds.
6.06      Regarding the above financing plan, the following assurances have
been received from the Government and the Company: (a) the Government will
itself provide US$30 million (LE 21 million) and ensure an additional US$5
million (LE 3.4 million) of equity funds from other shareholders and/or the
Government as needed by the Project; (b) the Government will onlend the
proceeds of the Bank loan on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank
(i.e. at the terms mentioned above); and (c) should a cost overrun occur or
should NSWC experience - as expected - operating cash deficits during Project
implementation, the Government will ensure that NSWC will be provided with
the necessary funds including foreign exchange, in the form of equity and/or
ioans, to complete the Project without delay. The funds should thereby
be provided in such a way as to help NSWC towards maintaining a debt/equity
ratio at or below 60:40 and attain a current ratio of at least 1.5:1.0 at
completion of the Project. For purposes of this covenant, the Project is
considered complete when the new spinning and weaving mills included in the



- 37 -
Project scope have been tested and proven to be satisfactory in accordance
with established engineering procedures and have operated at an average
production rate of 75% (or better) of their design capacity for not less than
60 consecutive days; the completion test period is expected to be completed by
April 1985.
C.   Procurement
6.07      The total value (CIF/ex-factory basis) of the equipment, materials
and spares for the Project is about US$50 million of which US$49 million (98%)
will be bid internationally using the Bank's procurement guidelines and the
balance, which is either not suitable for or cannot be more economically
acquired through international procurement, will be purchased locally. Of
the internationally bid items, about US$46 million will be procured through
international competitive bidding (ICB) and US$3 million through limited
international tendering, on the basis of suitability, availability and price
considerations. Limited international tendering will be restricted to imported
items each costing less than US$100,000 (CIF basis) equivalent, proprietary
equipment, and items in limited international supply or whose delivery periods
are critical to the timely completion of the Project. The main civil works
contract will also be bid under ICB; it will include: (a) construction
overhead and profit, (b) the cost of imported construction equipment and
materials, and (c) the cost of locally procured materials and sub-contracted
services. The total value of this contract is estimated at US$14 million
including about US$8.4 million in foreign exchange (US$6.3 million for directly
imported equipment and materials and US$2.1 million for overhead and profit).
Some construction equipment presently in short supply in Egypt and needed by
local contractors bidding for the other civil works items 1/ with an estimated
value of US$1.5 million will also be purchased using limited international
tendering and would be sold to the local contractors after their work on the
Project is completed. Some imported cement and structural steel with an
estimated foreign exchange cost of US$0.5 million for the other civil works
items will be purchased from Government enterprises who are the exclusive
agents for importing these materials. The remaining civil works items, with
an estimated value of US$5 million, including about US$2 million of indirect
foreign exchange cost, will be bid using local competitive bidding and will
not be financed from the Bank loan. Assurances have been obtained from the
Government that the Project will be able to acquire the necessary quantity
of construction materials, either by direct imports or by local purchases, to
maintain the implementation schedule.
6.08      For internationally bid items to be financed by the Bank, the list
of goods will require prior Bank approval and suppliers will be prequalified.
Qualified local equipment suppliers will be allowed to participate in inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) with a 15% (or the import duty rate if
lower) preference margin. However, because of the limited capacity and
capability of the domestic equipment industry, practically all of the plant
equipment and materials bid internationally are expected to be supplied
from abroad. Contractors participating in international competition will be
required to submit a list of equipment they intend to import for the Project
in accordance with the construction schedule. A fixed mobilization advance
1/   The other civil works items not covered by the main civil works contract
are site preparation and piling; site improvements (roads, etc.); housing,
administrative and social facilities; and general service areas.



- 38 -
estimated at about 20% 11 of the contract value will be provided. Again,
because of the shortage of construction services and capacity in Egypt, the
main civil works contract is expected to be awarded to a foreign or a joint
venture firm. For purposes of bid comparison (for both plant machinery and
civil works items), the highest rate of exchange for the foreign currencies
concerned declared by the Central Bank of Egypt will be applied.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Funds
6.09      The allocation of the Bank funds is shown below:
NSWC Project - Allocation of Bank Group Funds
US$ Million         % to be Financed
1.  Plant Equipment, Materials & Spares       45.7         100% of foreign expenditures
(FOB); Ocean Freight and Insurance;                   or local ex-factory prices.
Foreign Erection Services
2.  Main Civil Works Contract                 10.4         100% of foreign expenditures
for imported items and 35% of
local expenditures for other
items.
3.  Imported Construction Equipment            2.0         100% of foreign expenditures for
and Locally Procured Construction                     imported items and 60% of local
Materials                                             expenditures for other items.
4.  Technical Assistance & Training            3.5         100% of foreign expenditures.
5.  Unallocated                                7.4
Total               69.0
6.10      The technical assistance services proposed for Bank financing
have already been contracted (para 5.17). Retroactive financing to cover an
estimated US$1.0 million of disbursements after February 1, 1980 for technical
assistance (US$0.3 million), and civil works items (US$0.7 million) is recom-
mended. The estimated disbursement schedule for the Bank Group funds is shown
in Annex 6-5.
1/   The actual percentage will be determined when the bidding documents
are finalized.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Revenue and Operating Cost Assumptions for the Project 1/
7.01      The new spinning and weaving mills are assumed to start commercial
production in April 1984 at an initial capacity utilization 2/ of 50%, then
70% during 1985 and reaching the steady state at about 90% in 1986 at a
production efficiency of 87% for the new spinning mill and 85% for the new
weaving mill respectively. Although it is possible for the new mills to
achieve a production efficiency of 90% or better given the intention to
establish a meaningful production bonus system, training, and the technical
assistance included in the project scope, this higher level of efficiency will
probably be achieved only over a few years and the efficiencies mentioned
above have been used from 1984 onwards in the financial analysis. The rehabil-
itated facilities are expected to be fully operational by early 1984 but for
the financial analysis, they are only assumed to produce the incremental
output commercially starting in April 1984. The production efficiency of the
rehabilitated weaving mills has been assumed as 77% for mill No. 4 and 80% for
mill No. 1. The remaining spinning mill No. 3 at Karmouz, which is not
rehabilitated, has been assumed to operate at 55% production efficiency.
These would yield a weighted average production efficiency of 80% for NSWC as
a whole including the new mills after the Project is completed. Depreciation
charges (Annex 7-1) are on a historical cost basis using the straight line
method over a weighted average of 15 years and takes into account the different
depreciation periods allowed for civil works and equipment under Egyptian
practice. Except for the labor costs of the project facilities, textile
products and polyester prices (see below), all other prices and costs are
those prevailing at the end of 1979, and have been escalated throughout the
forecast period in the financial analysis at the international price inflation
rates on the assumption that price increases for these items (e.g. textile
inputs) will follow the international rates from 1980 onwards.
7.02      The Project is designed to produce high-quality textile products
and a small portion of the output, equivalent to 10% by weight (824 tpy) of
NSWC's total production is to be exported. The exports correspond to about
7% of the finished fabrics, 29% of the bedsheets and 25% of the terry towels,
although the domestic demand could absorb all of the Project's production.
At present, the ex-factory price of non-rationed, 100% cotton fabrics is about
90% of the international price. However, in the case of polyester/cotton
fabrics, the domestic price is about 30% to 50% higher than the international
price due to an almost negligible domestic production capacity at present and
the high import duties on textiles. For the financial analysis, the ex-factory
prices for the Project's output during the 1980's have been assumed as follows:
1/   In the financial and economic analysis of the Project, references to
NSWC refer also to the successor company to be established under Law 43
which will assume all the assets and liabilities of NSWC and will operate
all the production facilities of NSWC including those included in the
Project.
2/   100% capacity utilization equals 8,000 hours per year of operation.



- 40 -
(a) for polyester/cotton fabrics - 100% of the international price; (b)
for 100% cotton fabrics (rationed cloth) - LE 0.28 per meter 1/ which is the
price currently set by the Government; (c) for sheets, garments and towels -
about 95% of the international (FOB) price; (d) for sewing thread - 73% of
the export price; and (e) for commission finishing - 75% of the economic price
since a significant portion (30% to 40%) will involve the finishing of rationed
fabrics for other companies (Annex 7-2).
7.03      The average labor cost assumed for the new mills is LE 79 (US$114)
per man-month (in constant end of 1979 LE) or about 65% higher in real terms,
than NSWC's present wage bill (including social overhead) and already in-
corporates a production bonus component. This level is considered to be
competitive with alternative private sector employment in the Alexandria area
from where the Project will recruit its labor force. The polyester fiber
delivered price of LE 1,810/ton (US$2,623/ton) is based on the expected import
cost in the 1980's including import duties, although the Project will utilize
locally produced polyester. Labor costs, textile products and polyester
prices, have also been escalated in the financial forecasts at the assumed
international inflation rates.
7.04      About 81% of the raw cotton requirements of the Project can be met
by imported short-staple and the balance by medium to long staple cotton.
At present, the imported short-staple cotton used by local textile mills is
sold to them by the Government at the same price of LE 933/ton (US$1,352/ton)
as the Egyptian medium staple variety (i.e. the Ashmouni and GIZA 66 varieties).
The long staple (i.e. Menoufi or GIZA 69) cotton price to the local spinners
is presently LE 967/ton (US$1,401/ton) and the financial forecast assumes that
these local prices will also escalate at the international inflation rates.
7.05      The production cost structure for the various mills after the Project
is completed is shown in Annex 7-3. The total NSWC sales revenue and produc-
tion cost structure is summarized below:
1/   Equivalent to LE 0.35/mi  since rationed fabrics are only 0.8 meters wide.

the amount shown (LE 3.7 million) is for the full 7,000 employees.



- 42 -
Cotton and polyester will account for about 35% and depreciation charges about
22% of the production cost of NSWC when the Project reaches full production.
Although the Project's variable costs are fairly high at about 63% of total
production cost, the Project still shows a good increase in profitability with
higher capacity utilization and thus provides a sound financial basis for
introducing a production incentive system. The Government'! excise duty on
yarn output of LE 28.6/ton and treasury taxes of LE 0.025/m9 of woven fabric
(Annex 7-3) have been included in the production cost of NSWC and are also
included in the assumed selling prices. These taxes account for 5% of the
production cost.
7.06      The production cost of the Project is internationally competitive
primarily because of the low cotton prices relative to the international
price, the low wage rate (even after assuming the increase in wage rate
envisaged under the Project) and the low cost of energy (power and heating
fuel) in Egypt. The Project is forecast to provide at least LE 8.7 million
(in 1979 constant LE) annually of operating profit when the Project reaches
full production from 1986 onwards and should ensure the financial viability of
the Company.
B.   NSWC - Financial Forecast with the Project
7.07      The projections of the debt service payments, the production, the
income, the cashflow and the balance sheet statements together with the major
assumptions used for the financial analysis of NSWC with the Project, are
presented in Annexes 7-4 through 7-8. The financial statements are summarized
on the following page.  The financial forecasts indicate a satisfactory finan-
cial situation for NSWC, after the Project exceeds the profit breakeven capa-
city utilization rate in 1985, with a long-term debt service coverage ratio
of at least 1.9 before profit distribution. But because of large operating
cash deficits expected during the implementation period (1980-83), additional
equity funds (about LE 2 million in 1980 and LE 4 million per year during
1981-83) are assumed to be provided to cover the operating cash deficits and
improve the Company's tight current ratio. The Government will ensure (para
6.05) that such equity funds will be made available to NSWC. In the finan-
cial forecast, the sale of assets has not been assumed in assessing the extent
of the possible additional equity infusion. The debt/equity ratio will be
as high as 66:34 during project implementation but is expected to be about
57:43 by the end of 1985, the first full year of production. Thus, when the
Project starts commercial operation in 1984 (at 50% capacity utilization for 9
months), the current ratio could be as low as 1.0. But the situation can
rapidly improve if no dividends are paid out during 1985 and 1986 in which
case the current ratio will be 1.5 at the end of 1985 and reach 2.5 a year
later. Should NSWC promptly sell a parcel, about 3 acres, of industrial land
at Maharrem Bey it no longer needs, and another of about 8 acres of the
Karmouz site after Project completion 1/, or if the reduction of surplus labor
were faster than assumed (Annex 5-5), then the additional equity infusion
during Project implementation would be less than indicated in the forecasts.
1/   The price of 2land at Karmouz and Maharrem Bey at present is at least
LE 100 per m

a/   In the financial forecast with the Project, it is assumed that there is a gradual
reduction in surplus labor between 1980 and 1984 (Annex 5-5).
b/   Nine months of production at 50% capacity utilization of new spinning and weaving
mills.
c|   Profit plus short-term and long-term interest as a % of total assets at book value.
If the fixed assets at the end of 1979 is also the 1979 revalued amount, then the
percentage for 1986 and 1987 would be about 12% and 17% respectively.



- 44 -
Starting 1986, when capacity utilization is expected to reach 90%, the after
tax profits are expected to be at least 22% of sales revenue and the return on
assets employed (revalued) should exceed 12%. The financial covenants (para
7.10) also require that NSWC will take all reasonable actions to improve its
current ratio during project implementation, such as by obtaining additional
equity funds, selling assets no longer required for its operation, or reducing
the surplus labor, and to maintain the current ratio at 1.5 or higher after
Project completion. To this end NSWC has agreed that the proceeds from the
sale of any assets (e.g., land, building, old equipment) that will no longer
be needed by NSWC will be retained in the Company to improve its financial
situation, and to help cover any cost over-run in the Project should it occur.
The profit and cash breakeven capacity utilizations for the entire NSWC opera-
tion after the Project is completed are calculated at 60% and 55% respectively.
Upon reaching 90% capacity utilization (1986), NSWC is still expected to show
a profit breakeven even if the textile product prices were to fall by 17% or
if the cotton prices increased by 123% or about 30% above the projected
international price level (para 8.03).
C.   Financial Rate of Return
7.08      The financial rate of return was calculated by treating the existing
assets of NSWC as sunk costs and by excluding the cost of the surplus labor
after Project completion. 1/  The cost/benefit streams for the financial rate
of return are expressed in constant end of 1979 LE (Annex 7-9). The financial
rate of return is 22% before taxes and 20% after taxes and is therefore
satisfactory. The return before and after taxes are not very different
because of the five-year tax holiday and because the income tax rate of 40% is
applicable only to the profits retained by the Company. Sensitivity tests
(Annex 7-9) show that even under moderately adverse conditions, such as a 10%
increase in capital costs, or a 10% fall in product prices, or a 20% increase
in the cash production costs (equivalent to a 78% increase in the cotton price
if all other costs are unchanged), the after-tax return would still be at
least 15%.
D.   Financial Covenants
7.09      To safeguard the financial position of the Company, especially in
the areas of cotton pricing and product mix (para 7.11) of the enterprise
(i.e. areas that are partly outside the control of NSWC), agreement was
reached with the Government that:
(a) After Project completion, it will not take any action which would
prevent NSWC from (i) generating sufficient revenues to meet all
operating expenses and to service its debt, and (ii) from earning
a reasonable return on investment under conditions of efficient
operation 2/;
1/   This methdology would yield a slightly lower rate of return compared to
the method of incremental cash flow on a with and without the Project
basis because of the large cash deficits of the Company without the
Project especially after 1983. If the cost of the surplus labor after
1983 is included in the Project operating cost, the return drops to 19%.
2/   Earn a return on assets (revalued) employed of 12% or higher at a
production efficiency of 80% and a capacity utilization rate of 100%.



- 45 -
7.10      NSWC also agreed to follow prudent financial practices, and observe
the following:
(a) It will limit any prepayment of debt, profit distribution,
or other long-term investments in order to maintain a
current ratio of at least 1.5 after Project completi*n;
(b) Not incur any additional long-term debt if its future debt
service ratio will (i) fall below 1.2 after allowing for
profit distribution, and (ii) fall below 1.5 before distribution
of profits;
(c) It will not take any action, other than concluding the subsidiary
loan agreement for the Bank funds, which would cause its debt/
equity ratio to exceed 60:40 or make the ratio higher if it
already exceeds 60:40;
(d) Until December 1987, consult with the Bank before undertaking
any other modernization or expansion program or any other in-
vestment not related to the Project exceeding US$3 million
equivalent annually.
(e) Have its accounts continue to be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. 1/
(f) It will set its product mix (or production program) in a manner
that will (i) insure efficient utilization of its facilities, and
(ii) under conditions of efficient operation, earn a reasonable
return on its investment.
(g) It will operate the new spinning mill, the new weaving mill,
and the modernized converting plant as separate profit/cost
centers and maintain separate accounts for each unit.
(h) It will retain in the Company the proceeds from any sale
of assets no longer required for the Company's operation.
E.   Major Risks
7.11      The Project does not face any major technical risks but as mentioned
earlier (para 4.02), serious potential management and organizational as well
as financial risks exist. These risks can only be contained with the strong
commitment of NSWC's chairman, with the assistance of technical consultants
and with the Government's support, especially by allowing the Company to adopt
a new compensation system. The financial forecasts in paras 7.07 and 7.08
assume that the Company will have the necessary complement of qualified manage-
ment and factory personnel which should be possible once the Company has been
1/   All public sector enterprises are audited by a Government agency, the
Central Agency for Auditing, which is acceptable. The successor company
will however, be audited by private accounting firms.



- 46 -
transformed into a private-sector enterprise under Law 43 and adopts
a new compensation system. The financial risks are related to the expected
large cash operating deficits during Project implementation which would need
to be financed by additional equity funds in order to avoid a fatal liquidity
problem and a serious erosion of the equity base. The Government has agreed
that such funds will be made available to NSWC. The Project also faces some
commercial risks, especially in the exports of its products and in the
production of rationed fabrics. If the Government should maintain the
Company's quota of rationed fabrics above the production of the existing or
the remaining (after the scrapping of obsolete looms) narrow width looms,
which are the appropriate machinery for manufacturing the relatively narrow
and inferior rationed fabrics, then the Company will be forced to use the
wider width and modern equipment to produce an inferior and unprofitable
product instead of the profitable high quality fabrics the equipment is
capable of producing. The covenants in para 7.09(a) and para 7.10(f) above
are also designed to avoid uneconomic use of the Project facilities.
7.12      The Company presently exports a small quantity of textile products,
mostly yarn, but only to trade agreement countries or middle-eastern coun-
tries. NSWC does not therefore have now the experience and expertise to
market the Project's output in the more competitive west European or US
markets in which Egypt has so far not fulfilled its export potential. The
technical consultants will assist NSWC develop an export marketing group
within the Company.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.  Economic Input and Textile Prices
8.01      The economic costs and benefits of the Project are expressed in
constant end of 1979 LE and the tradeable items have been valued at their
respective border prices. The two major non-tradeable items are power and
labor. For power, the economic cost of LE 0.035 (US$0.051) per KWH is based
on the marginal economic cost of thermal power generation in Egypt and is 133%
higher than the financial cost of LE 0.015 (US$0.022) per KWH and power costs
account for about 9% of the economic production cost. The economic cost of-
labor is taken as identical to the financial cost, which is already 65% hfigher,
in real terms than the prevailing wage--rate paid by the Company (para 7.b2T.~
Salaries and wages account for about 20% of the econAie .production cost.
8.02      The tradeable items are cotton, polyester, chemicals (dyes and
sizing materials), fuel oil and maintenance materials. With the exception
of cotton and fuel oil, the financial prices of the other inputs are based
on the delivered costs of imports. The only adjustment to the financial
cost are therefore the indirect taxes of 8% on the chemicals and maintenance
materials and the import duties of 17% on the polyester fibers. The economic
price of fuel oil is taken as LE 103.5 (US$150) per ton, 1/ almost 73% more
than the financial cost of LE 60.0 (US$87.0) per ton. Fuel oil, chemicals and
maintenance materials account for 5%, 4% and 5% respectively of the economic
production cost.
1/   On the basis of about US$33 per barrel of crude oil.  The fuel oil price
has historically been about 75% of the crude oil price.



- 47 -
8.03      Polyester has become an economic and accepted substitute for short-
staple cotton and the polyester price is expected to follow the price trends
of short-staple cotton closely. Because of a temporary over-supply, the pres-
ent polyester fiber price of about US$1.55 per kg FOB is below the expected
long-term price. But this situation is expected to change in the future as
demand for polyester continues to grow and polyester's share of the world
fiber consumptibon increases. A long-term international price of US$1.95 per
kg 1/ FOB, has been taken and reflects both the expected long-term production
cost of polyester as well as the price trend of cotton. The delivered economic
cost of polyester is about US$2.27 (LE 1.57) per kg. The long-term interna-
tional price for short-staple cotton is estimated at about US$2.05 per kg 1/
(CIF, Northern Europe), and as this will be imported the corresponding economic
delivered cost is about US$2.15 (LE 1.48) per kg or almost 13% more than the
financial price. About one-third of the cotton requirements of the Project
will be of the medium to long staple variety produced in Egypt. Historically
(1952-1978), the standard extra long-staple Egyptian cotton (Menoufi) has sold
at an average premium of about 75% (CIF basis) above the standard short-staple
cotton variety (Mexican St. Middling 1-1/16 inches), although this premium
fluctuated rather widely and has been as low at 30% and as high as 130%. For
the Project however, less expensive types are adequate for its medium to long
staple cotton requirements (para. 5.14) and for purposes of the economic
analysis, the GIZA 69 variety is assumed to be used. This variety sold at
a historical premium of about 60% (CIF basis) above the short-Btaple cotton
price. The economic cost of the medium to long staple cotton requirements
of the Project has therefore been set at the export (FOB) price of US$3.15
(LE 2.17) per kg, about 2.2 times the financial price. On the average, the
economic cotton price is therefore 1.7 times the financial price 2/. The
derivation of the cotton and polyester prices are shown in Annex 8-1.
8.04      The economic value of the textile output is derived on the basis
of the export as well as the import substitution benefits of the Project.
Polyester/cotton blend products have not been produced in Egypt in the past
and only one firm has started production recently but on a limited scale.
Thus, the cotton/polyester products consumed locally have been valued at the
economic cost of imports. For the 100% cotton textile products, the export
prices have been used to value the locally consumed output. The economic
textile product prices are shown in Annex 7-2 together with the financial
prices. The economic value of NSWC's output is about US$63 million equivalent,
of which US$8 million is from export sales, and on the average, the economic
value of the production is about 7% above the financial value. The economic
value of the output and the production cost structure. of NSWC at 90% capacity
utilization are shown in Annex 7-3 and are summarized below.
8.05      While raw materials constitute the major portion of the production
cost of textiles, energy (power and heating fuel) and labor are also important
cost elements. Egypt is a net exporter of energy 3/ and its labor costs are
1/   In constant end of 1979 US dollars.
2/   However, if the excise duty and treasury taxes on textile production are
considered as part of the cotton financial cost, then the financial cost
will be about 70% of the economic cotton cost.
3/   About 60% of the present power generation of 2.7 thousand mega-watts
is hydro-electric power and there are plans to shift some thermal
power plants from fuel oil to natural gas, thereby allowing a higher
volume of fuel oil exports.



- 48 -
generally lower than the costs in many other textile exporting countries.
These factors, together with the availability of locally produced textile
fibers (long-staple cotton and   polyester), provides the basis for the
Project's, as well as Egypt's potential comparative advantage in textile
production. To transform this potential comparative advantage into an econo-
mically viable operation and more especially, a meaningful export performance,
will however require an improvement in the production efficiency - that is,
machine productivity, labor productivity, product quality and raw material
efficiency (waste reduction and utilization of raw materials toward their most
economically valuable product) along international standards. The Project, on
the basis of the technical assistance and other arrangements discussed earlier'
should be able to approach closely, if not achieve, international production
efficiency levels.

a!   At 90% capacity utilization.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
8.06      At 90% capacity utilization, the output of NSWC will provide a net
economic benefit of about LE 17.6 million annually. The economic rate of
return is satisfactory at about 22% and justifies the high priority accorded
by the Government to the rehabilitation and expansion of the textile industry.
SholJd capacity utilization rise faster than assumed (i.e. reaching 90%
a1^ _ady 1y 1985), which is possible, the return would be 23%.  Sensitivity
tescs 'Ainnex 8-2) indicate that the return would still be at least 14% even if



- 49 e
operating cost were to increase by 20% or if product prices decline by 15X, or
if capital costs increase by 20%.
C.   Other Benefits
8.07      The Project will set in motion the eventual relocation of NSWC's
spinning facilities out of the Karmouz site, which is a residenitial area
unsuited for a large industrial operation. This move should provide additional
urban spaEe for housing which is in great demand in Alexandria. About 2.5
million m by of the Company's PE/cotton fabric output will be sold locally,
and considering the high product quality expected, should provide opportunities
for establishing small-scale garments businesses not only for the local market
but also for exports. Garment production requires only modest capital invest-
ment and is labor intensive. As the Project will utilize imported short-staple
cotton and polyester fiber for about 86% of its fiber consumption, it will
help conserve Egypt's more valuable long-staple cotton for better economic
utilization. Finally, the Project will directly create about 2,000 new jobs.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01      During negotiations, the following major agreements and confirmations
were obtained:
From the Government:

(f) The Government will onlend to NSWC the Bank funds and provide
equity funds for the Project according to the financing plan
and terms discussed in paras 6.05 and 6.06 and in addition,
provide funds to NSWC or cause NSWC to be provided with funds
to cover any cash deficits in its current operations until the
Project is completed in a manner that will help NSWC achieved
a debt/equity ratio of 60:40 or better (paras 6.05 and 7.09);
(g) The Government will not take any action that will prevent NSWC
from (i) being financially viable and (ii) maintaining its
current ratio and its debt/equity ratio at acceptable levels
(para 7.09).
From NSWC:
(h) The Company will establish a successor company under Law 43 by
March 31 to assume all the assets and liabilities of NSWC and
operate all its production facilities (para 4.02);
(i) The Company will strengthen its management promptly after the
successor company has been established (para 4.19), maintain
the project implementation unit with qualified personnel (para
5.17), and staff the project facilities in a manner acceptable
to the Bank (para 5.19);
(j) The Company will design and implement a compensation/
benefits package that would be able to attract and retain
qualified personnel (para 4.20);
(k) The Company will operate and properly maintain the environmental
protection facilities included in the project scope (para 5.11);
and
(1) The Company will follow the financial covenants in para 7.10.
9.03      On the basis of the agreements listed above, the Project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$69 million equivalent to the Government for 15 years
including 4.5 years of grace to be onlent to the Company on the same terms and
at an interest rate of 10%.

B.   Least - Squares (Regression) Estimate of Consumption - GDP Elasticity
Equation I:  C = aGb
where   C = Apparent domestic textile consumption in million m2 of
fabric equivalent.
G - Gross Domestic Product at factor costs in 1975 prices
expressed in LE million.
b = textile consumption - GDP elasticity
a = a constant
Using the linear regression equation log C = log a + b log G
The least - squares estimate for b and log a are:
log a = 0.845461
or a   7.06
b = 0.56
The r2 (coefficient of determination or correlation) for the
equation is 0.874 which is significant at the cf= 0.0001 level
Equation I with the above values of a and b are used to forecast
textile consumption from 1980 to 1986 assuming GDP grows by 7%
per year as shown above.
1/ In constant 1975 prices. For 1980-86, GDP is assumed to grow at 7% per year.
2/ In fabric equivalent. The forecast is based on the regression equation defined
in Section B above.

a/   The average annual rated capacity of the spindles is about 110 kg of yarn per spindle.
b/   Approximately 47,424 spindles will be rehabilitated under the Project and transferred to the new spinning mill at
Maharrem Bey.
c/   From 1984 to 1987, the -production in Karmouz will come from mill No.3 which is a medium count yarn mill (NE 30 to
NE 45).  However, NSWC will actually need coarse count yarn (NE 10 to NE 24).  It is assumed that NSWC will
exchange this medium count yarn for coarse count yarn and the production cost estimate for mill No.3 is based
on the production of coarse, rather than medium count yarn. Mill No.3 is expected to be scrapped after 1987
and NSWC will either purchase 2,000 tpy of coarse count yarn or build another spinning mill at Maharrem Bey.
d/   47,424 spindles will operate for  nine  months and then transferred to the new mill at Maharrem Bey.

EGYPT: NSWC TEXTILE PROJECT
NSWC - ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL FORECAST WITHOUT THE PROJECT
A. Product Mix and Cotton Requirements
1.        It is assumed that rationed fabrics will constitute 35% of fabric
output. There will be no sales of grey fabrics (all will be converted). Long-
staple cotton will continue to be 23% of total cotton requirements, the balance
will be either short-staple and/or medium-staple cotton. The total cotton
consumption is shown in Annex 4-5. The yarn available for sale will be sold
as follows: 65% locally and 35% for exports.
B. Sales Prices
2.        The selling prices (in constant end of 1979 LE), including the excise
and treasury taxes are those prevailing at the end of 1979 as follows:
LE/Unit               LE/Unit
Domestic    Export   Percent   Weighted
Item                      Unit      Price       Price    Exports   Average Price

C.  Rehabilitation Requirement and Financing
3.    The existing plant will be rehabilitated (but not expanded) in 1981 for
LE 4.8 million equivalent to maintain production at about 40 million LMPY. The
depreciation charges (straight line, 12 years) will therefore increase by LE 0.4
million/year starting 1982. The investment will be financed by a long-term loan
from the Government of LE 4.8 million at10%  annual interest rate to be repaid
over 5 years starting 1983.
D. Production Cost Structure (in end of 1979 constant LE)./
4.    (a) Cotton Prices:  LE 933/ton for short and medium-staple cotton and
LE 967/ton for long-staple cotton (the prices prevailing at the
end (of 1979).
1/   These costs are those prevailing at the end of 1979.

(d) Other Production Costs:
(i) Salaries & Wages - LE 8.98 million/year. -
(ii) Other Direct Costs - LE 0.4 million/year
(iv) Other Indirect Costs - LE 0.95 million/year.
(e) Debt Service Payments - For long-term debt, as shown in Table I.
For short-term debt, interest is 9.0% annually on the balance out-
standing at the start of the year.
(f) Excise & Treasury Taxes (calculated on the basis of yarn and fabric
production) - The excise tax is LE 23/ton of yarn        the treasury
tax is about LE 10.5 per thousand meters of woven fabric.
(g) Indirect Taxes:   8% of       the cost of other raw materials and
supplies.
E. Balance Sheet Items.
5.        The following assumptions are used:
(a) Cash & Accounts Receivable - 30% of textile sales.
(b) Finished Goods & In-Process Inventory - LE 10.0 millioa in current
terms from 1981 onwards.
(c) Raw Materials & Supplies - 60% of the annual cost for these items.
(d) Accounts Payable & Others - 20% of the total production cost.
F. Profit Distribution.
6.        All the mandatory profit distribution are assumed to be paid out.
1/ It is assumed that any reduction in the labor force will be used to increase
the wage rates of the skilled workers, thereby keeping the total wage bill
more or less constant in real terms.

COTTON AND POLYESTER ECONOMIC PRICES
A. Cotton Economic Prices
1.          Egypt grows four basic varieties or types of cotton which range
from medium-staple to extra-long staple cotton. Most of the cotton exports
are the high quality long and extra-long staple varieties; while most of
the medium and some long-staple varieties are used by the domestic textile
industry. The different cotton varieties and their spinning limits are
shown below:

2.          Historically (1952-1978), the standard extra-long-steple Egyptian
cotton (Menoufi) has sold at an average premium of about 80% (CIF Northern
Europe) above the standard short-staple cotton variety (Mexican St. Middling
1-1/16 inches) although this premium has fluctuated rather widely and has
been as low as 30% and as high as 120% as shown below.

3.        The Bank's long-term price forecast (1985. and later) for the short-
staple cotton is US$2.05 per kg, CIF Northern Europe, in constant end of 1979
US dollars. On this basis, the corresponding Egyptian Menoufi price, using
a  premium of about 80%, would be US$3.69 per kg.         Ocean freight and
insurance for cotton would typically be about US$0.20 per kg.         Among
the different Egyptian cotton varieties, the Menoufi has historically
sold (FOB basis) at a premium of about 10% to 12% above the GIZA 69 price
and 30% to 35% above the Ashmouni price. These historical premiums are
used to derive the economic prices of the GIZA 69 and Ashmouni varieties
as shown below:
Egypt - Long-Term (1985 Onwards) Economic Prices of Cotton Varieties
Price In Constant End of 1979 US$ per kg
Egyptian Cotton                    FOB                      CIF, N. Europe
1.  Menoufi                       3.50                          3.70
2.  Giza 69                       3.15                          3.35
3.  Ashmouni                      2.65                          2.85
Short-Staple Cotton               1.85  (USA/Mexico)            2.05
4.        For the project, the Ashmouni variety would be adequate for the
medium to long-staple cotton requirements. However, for the economic
analysis,  tgae  FOB  price of  the GIZA  69   or  US$3.15/kg)
which is about 19%more than the Ashmouni price, has been used as the basis
for the cost of the medium to long-staple cotton that will be used by the
project. The imported short-staple cotton economic price, delivered to
the project facilities, is taken as US$2.15per kg  to allow for port hand-
ling, storage and local transport costs.
B. Polyester Economic Prices
5.        The long-term (1985 onwards) economic price of polyester fiber
is assumed as US$1.95per kg (FOB), in constant end of 1979 US dollars.  This
is higher than the prevailing depressed (due to temporary supply surpluses)
prices of about US$1.55 per kg,    but reflects both the expected long-
term production cost plus a reasonable return for new investments and the
price trend of short-staple cotton for which polyester is a substitute.
The delivered cost (financial and economic) of polyester to the project
facilities are shown below:

In LE per kg                             1.81                    1.57
6.     A new public sector 25,000 tpy polyester plant recently started commer-
cial production early 1980. Thus, polyester is locally available. For pur-
poses of the financial and the economic analysis, however, the delivered cost
is assumed to be identical to the cost of imports as shown above.
