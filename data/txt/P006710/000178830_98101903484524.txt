SUMARY
i.        The Government of Colombia has asked the Bank for a Us$16 million
loan, includming interest during construction, to finance most of the foreign
exchange costs of the 1967-1970 program to expand and improve the telephone,
telex and telegraph facilities of the Empresa Nacional de Telecomunm caciones
(TELECOM). The estimated total cost of the program is US$27.6 mllion
equivalent.
II,       The proposed Borrower is the Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones
(TELECOM). This Government agency has been operating since 1947 and provides
almost the entire long-distance public telecommunication services of Colombia
and all the international telecommunication service. TELECOM also furnishes
local telephone service in 350 small localities. The telephone networks of
the large cities are owned by the corresponding municipalities but are
connected to TELECOM's long-distance system,
iii.      TELECOMts technical staff, with the assistance of consultimng
services and the training program established, is able to carry out the
expansion program satisfactorily0 Its organization and management are
reasonably experienced and competent to operate successfully the new
facilities,
Iv.       The proposed program is technically sound and comprises the
installation of facilitles urgently needed to meet the primcipal domestic
long-dlstance and international telecommunication requirements of Colombia,
and should materially improve the quality of service rendered.
v,        The equipment to be financed under the proposed Bank loan would
be purchased through internatlonal competitive bidding and in accordance
with plans and specifications prepared with the assistance of competent
consulting engineers.
Vi.       The financial results in recent years have been unsatisfactory.
SubstantLal tariff adjustments were made in 1965 but their effects were
largely offset by increases in costs. In October 1966 the international
tariffs were increased 50% and the national telephone tariffs were increased
approximately 20%. This brought the earnings close to a satisfactory level.
Other than an adjustment in international tariffs before the fourth quarter
of 1967, reflecting the increase in the exchange rate applicable to transfers
in the capital market, no further tariff adjustment is expected to be required
in the near future, During loan negotiations, an undertaking was obtained
that this adjustment in international tariffs would be made before October 1,



- li -
1967 and that in the future tariffs would be maLntained at a level such
as to produce a return of 9% on net fixed assets in service. On this
basis TELECOM should be able to maintain a sound financial position.
vii.      The Project provides a suitable basis for a loan of US$16 million
with a 20-year term including a grace period of 4 years.

APPRAISAL OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EXPANSION PROGRAM
ENPRESA NACIONAL DE TELECOMUNICACIONES
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Columbia has asked the Bank for a loan of
US$16 million equivalent to finance most of the foreign exchange costs
of the 1967-70 program to expand and improve the telecommunication facil-
ties of the Empresa Nacional de Telecomunacaciones (TELECOM). This
Government-owned organization would be the Borrower.
1.02      The estimated cost of the program forming the basis of the present
loan application is US$27.6 million equivalent. An estimated US$19.7 million
would be in foreign exchange and Col$128 million would be in local currency.
The foreign exchange requirements would be provided mainly out of the pro-
posed loan proceeds. The balance of requirements would be provided from
funds generated by TELECOM's operations except for US$3.7 million of the
foreign exchange requirements which will be provided by suppller credits
under contracts already placed or corresponding to equipment additions for
which procurement by international competitive bidding is not practicable.
1.03      The main facilities to be provided under the proposed loan are
for long-distance telephone service but the program includes expansion and
improvement of telegraph and telex services and installation of local tele-
phone facilities in some of the smaller cities. The bulk of the expansion
of the local telephone systems is being carried out separately by the
municipalities and provinces.
lO4       The basis for the present program is a long-range plan prepared
in 1962 by the London consulting firm, Preece, Cardew & Rider. Commencing
with dlscussions with the Bank mn 1963, several appraisals have been carried
out and a serles of tariff increases have been applied. The last appraisal
was made in February 1967 by Messrs. S. S. Scales and R. N. Walsh. Their
findings provide the basis for this report.

2 TELECOM10iUNICATIONS IN COLOIVIBTIA
2.01      The responsibility for providing telecommunication services i
Colombia is divided among several organizations. TELECOM' s princLpal
operations are long-distance telephone, telegraph and telex services, both
national and international, while almost all local telephone service is pro-
vided by municipal organizations   Thub TELECOM's principal domestic telephone
business is handling traffic between municipalities. There also exist a few
systems owned and operated by provincial organizations. TELECO1M has over
the years, upon the request of a number of small municipalities, assumed
responsibility for providing local services. This trend is likely to con-
tinue but the more important municipalities, backed by the strong feeling
of regional independence, can be expected to maintain their own services.
2 02      The principal telecommunication organizations, 33 in all, have
formed a common association (Associacion Nacional de Empresas de Telefonos)
which plays an important role in finaing solutions to common problems such
as standardization of operating procedures, coordination of expansion plans,
system interconnections, tariff adjustments and div-sion of revenues from
toll calls. Although a simpler way of coordinating operations would be
achieved by consolidating all public telecommunication operation min a single
agency, this is not necessary as a reasonable level of coordination between
systems is being obtained.
3. THE BORROlWER
3 01      TELECOM is an autonomous Government entity organized in 1947 when
the assets of the privately-owned Compania Telefonica Central were acquired
by purchase.  In 1950 TELECOM took over the assets, liabilities and personnel
of the Government-owned Empresa Nacional de Radlotelecomunicaciones and in
1965 it took over the telegraph facilities and personnel of the Ministry of
Communications
Organizat3on - Administration
3.02      TELECO1H is governed by a Board of Directors, comprising four
regular members and two alternates. The Minister of Communications and
the Director of the Ministry of Communications are by reason of their
offices, respectively, the Chairman and one of the regular members of the
Board.  All members are appointed by the President of the country   The
Minister of Communications and the two regular members of the Board have
been associated with TELECOH's operations for an extended period and are
excperienced business executives. At the time of the recent appraisal
no appointment had been made to the post of Director of the MYnistry of
Communications. The twjo alternate directors are active in professional
circles and serve on a number of other boards of directors of other
enterprises



- 3 -
3e03      The Director-General is the chief executive of TELECOM and iS
responsible for the day-to-day operations. He is appointed by the
President of the country. The present Director-General has been associated
with TELECOM's operations for about eight years having served previously as
a member of the Board and at one time as Financial Director. Together with
the Secretary-General, the Director-General attends Board meetings but has
no vote. During loan negotiations an undertaking was obtained from TELECOM
that the Bank would be informed promptly of any changes in management and that
the Bank would be furnished with miformation concernLng the experLence and
competence of new management.
Organization - Operations
3.o4      There are four functional divisions, Financial, Industrial
Relations, Technimcal and Operations. Each is headed by a Director of
Division who reports to the Director-General. Also reporting diroctly
to the Director-General are the Secretary-General, the Legal Counsel,
the Chief of the Organization and Methods Department and permanently-
retained consultants. The organizational chart is showin iAnnex 1.
3.o5      For operating purposes the country is divided into seven zones.
Each zone is headed up by a manager who nominally reports to the Director-
General in Bogota but for operating, technical, personnel and financial
functions, the link is directly with the corresponding operating dlivision,
3,06      TELECOM is overstaffed.  The excess results mainly from the
transfer mi 1965 of 4,000 employees from the Ministry of Communications
together with the telegraph facilities formerly operated by that Ministry.
This situation of excessive employment is recognized by management and a
retraining program has been commenced to absorb as many as possible of the
excess staff in the new positions created through the expansion of the
system. This program, together with normal attrition, should make it possible
to bring about a gradual improvement in operating efficiency, At loan nego-
tiations it was agreed that, during the period of the construction program,
TELECOM would submit to the Bank for comment a budget of personnel require-
ments for the coming year and would limit annual increases to a maximum of
5% of the number of employees at the beginnimng of the year. Since overall
annual growth in traffic is expected to exceed 10%, a gradual improvement
in personnel utilization should result. The increase during 1966 was limited
to about 1% of the number of employees and a simlar very limited increase
is expected in 1967.
3.07      The men in charge of the principal divisions of TELECOM are
experienced and capable of managing an enlarged operation. The con-
sultants, Preece, Cardew & Rider, assisted in the broad planning and
continue to provide technical assistance under a general advisory contract.
In additlon, arrangements have recently been completed under which engineers
from the German Bundespost will provide assistance for mLerowave engineering
and operations. A telecommunications training center has been established
with assistance of the UNDP. These measures should be adequate to enable
TELECOM to carry out the expansion program satisfactorily.

4. EXISTING FACILITIES
Nat-ional
4.01      TELECOIM's network is comprised of the following facilities
VHF radio systems,
Pole lines with open-wire and carrier circuits,
Automatic long-distance dialing equlpment,
Telegraph and telex equipment,
Local telephone netwjorks.
4 02      A VHF radio netwiork, interconnecting 27 cities, prov,des the
principal long-distance telecommunications facilities with about 140,OCO
kilometers of telephone circuits in operation. The original design of
Colombia's backbone VHF system was aimed at providing service with the
minimum of investment   As a result of subsequent growth, its capacity
today is far exceeded by demand and the quality and reliability of service
are not as good as needed. Extending from the basic VHF network are VHF
spurs of five- to nine-circuit capacity and a few single channel VHF links.
The radio and associated carrier equipmnnts are in good condition and well
maintained. IJhen replaced by equipment of greater capacity they can be
used effectively on routes with less traffic.
4.03      In addition to the VHF radio network there is a very extensive
system of pole lines carrying approximately 65,000 kilometers of open-
wire circuits with long-distance telephone connections to nearly 600 cities
and towns. The open-wire system is made up of two networks. One is in good
condition and almost entirely comprised of copper wire with superimposed
carrier circuits   The other is the telegraph network recently transferred
to TELECCI4 from the Mimnstry of Communications. The latter system is
composed of copper and iron circuits extending not only betwqeen the major
cities and towns but also to a large number of villages. It is in general
poorly maintained.  Some portions of this telegraph open-wire netw7ork whlch
parallel existing telephone lines will be scrapped during the expansion
program to reduce maintenance and operating costs.
4 04      Since 1956, TELECOM has carried out a progressive automatization
of its principal long-distance telephone connections.   As a result, 8c of
traffic is fully automatic and 77i is semi-automatic while 15% is still
handled zrnually. Details of the amount and type of automatic long-distance
swiltching equipment in service are given in Annex 2.
4 05      TELECOM has more than 1,300 telegraph offices including installations
in small villages where very little traffic is handled. Three-fourths of
the telegraph circuits are operated on a hand-keyed basis. In an effort
to eliminate the expense of maintaining a telegraph operator in the small
unremunerative offices, TELECOIvi has a program of creating "Mixed Offices"
where the Postnaster or a postal clerk handles the telegraph messages via
telephone connection to the nearest important town from which point the
message is handled under normal telegraph procedures



- 5 -
4.06      The telex network of TELECOM is modern and one of the most
extensive of any Latin American nation. Connections are established by
dialing, both for local and long-distance connections. Subscribers to the
national network also have access to the international circuits. There
are 27 switching centers and approximately 2,000 teleprinters in operation.
4.07      Local telephone service forms a very small part of TELECOM's
business, having less than 10,000 telephones compared with more than
400,000 telephones operated by municipal and provincial organizationso
With the exception of equipment for 1,300 subscribers in Buenaventura
and 500 in San Andres, all its exchange telephone service is manual.
There are approximately 350 of these small exchanges.
International
4.08      International telephone and telegraph service is provided mainly
by means of high-frequency radlo equipment located near Bogota and operating
with Europe, U.S.A., Central America and South America. The radio-telephone
service is subject to the noise, interruptions and other inadequacies inherent
to this type of equipment, Details are shown in Annex 3.
4.09      In addition there are land line telephone circuits connecting
with the systems of Venezuela and Ecuador.
5. DEMAND FOR SERVICE
Local Telephone Service
5.01      Like other countries of Latin America, Colombia has a low
telephone density of 2.4 telephones per 100 inhabitants. In neighboring
countries, Panama has a telephone density of 3.6, Venezuela 3.2 and
Ecuador 0.8. These may be compared with 5.9 for the entire world and
30 to 48 for the most highly developed countries.
5.02      Of the 623 towns in the country, the largest 72 have automatic
telephone service. These 72, with approximately 400,000 telephone lines
in service, have a backlog of unsatisfied demand of more than 100,000.
In the smaller towns, whlich generally have only manual service, there is
a demand for automatic service as well as for expansion of facilities.
5.03      During the period 1953 to 1960 growth of telephones averaged
over 12% per year. Since 1960, because of financial limitations, a lower
growth averaging only 8% has been attained.



- 6 -
5.o4      Current programs under way or proposed by the municipal telephone
systems provide for adding about 300,000 telephones over a six-year period,
representing an average annual increase of approximately 11%. The bulk
of this expansion will have to be carried out by the munmicipal organiza-
tion of the principal cities but financial limitations will probably result
in a reduction of this program. TELECOM, in accordance with recommendations
of its consultants has, for the purposes of developing its construction
program, estimated that the future imcrease in telephones will equal the
annual average actually experienced since 1960, or about 8%. This estimate
appears realistic.
Long-Distance Telephone Service - National
5 05      The existing long-distance circuits are not sufficient to meet
the demand for service. As a result long delays are experienced in com-
pletmng calls and requests for telephone connection are often cancelled
by subscribers when waiting periods are excessive. To reduce these can-
cellations to a reasonable level, it is estimated that a doubling of the
existing number of circuits is required. Once subscriber-to-subscriber
dialing is generally established throughout the netiork, the improved
service ijill further increase demand. For example, when subscriber dialing
was established from Cali to Palmira, from Tunja to Bogota and bettieen
Barranquilla and other cities, the traffic increased to five times that
existing under manual operation.
5.o6      The growth of telecoumunication traffic in recent years is
shown in Annex 4   Long-distance telephone service has increased at an
average rate of 15% since 1960 but in 1965 and 1966, years in which
tariff increases were applied, a lesser growth resulted. It is reason-
able to expect that annual growth of at least 10% will be maintained
during the program period.
5 07      An analysis of calls showis that nearly 50% of the usage of
long-distance telephone service is for purposes of commerce and industry.
It can reasonably be expected that after a satisfactory standard of service
has been achieved a further increase of industrial and coimmercial traffic
may be expected, so reflecting the importance of good telecommunication
services to efficient operation of private and government organizations.
Long-Distance Telephone Servlce - International
5 08      Traffic has increased approximately 12% per year but has been
limited by insufficiency of facilities. As high frequency radio equipment
sufficient to provide 20 addlitional telephone circuits is scheduled



- 7 -
to go into service at the end of 1963, it is estimated that the annual
rate of growth will be 20% ln 1969 and 15%o thereafter.
Telegraph Service
5.09      Since the transfer of the telegraph facilities in 1965 from the
Ilinistry of Communications to TELECOA, little overall growth of domestic
telegraph traffic has been observed. Therefore it has been estimated that
there will be no growth in domestic telegraph traffic during the con-
struction program. However, international telegraph traffic has increased
at an annual rate of 10%.   In view of the improvement Ln the quality of
service expected to result from the new facilities to be provided for
international service under the program, a rate of growth of at least this
amount should be obtained in the future.
Telex Service
5 11      TELECOM's relatively newr telex service has been well received
by the business community, traffic having quadrupled in the last five
years.  Growth of national telex service is forecast at 25O in 1967
tapering to 10' in 1970 while growth of international telex service is
estimated at the annual rate of 15%.
6   THE PROJECT
General
6 01      The project covers the initial portion of an eight-year
telecommunications development plan prepared by consultants but adjusted
to give effect to developments since that tine. It is to be carried out
in the period 1967-70 and consists of the purchase of land, construction
of buildings and purchase of equipment, materials and services for the
necessary engineering and installation as described in the following
paragraphs.
Principal Long-Distance Telephone Systems
6 02      The principal facilities included i1 the project are the
following.
(a) lAicrowave systems interconnecting Bogota, Bucaramanga,
Neiva, Girardot, Pereira, Call and Medellin, also one
between Barranquilla and Santa Marta
(b) Short coaxial and voice frequency cable systems.
(c) Recovery of the existing VHF radio equipment and its
reinstallation on routes of intermediate capacity
requirements



- 8 -
(d) Carrier equipment for the above systems.
(e) Toll switching equipment (extensions and new switching
centers) in 83 cities and towns.
Details are shown on maps at the end of this report.
Secondary Long-Distance Routes
6.03      The project includes increases in the long-distance circuits
between the large capacity microwave system and the communities not along
the routes of this microwave network by means of open wire, cables, carrier
on open wire and VHF radio. In addition, a limited amount of open-wire
route reconstruction would be carried out.
New Urban Facilities
6e04      In some of the small munLcipalities where TELECOM is responsible
for the local telephone service, the old manual exchanges would be converted
to automatic operation under the project and the corresponding outside net-
works would be enlarged to provide for growth.
Interconnection Facilities
6e°5      The project includes the facilities, mainly automatic equipment,
required to interconnect TELECOMIs long-distance telephone network with the
local networks operated by the municipalities0 With the increase in long-
distance circults a corresponding increase must be made in the links between
each long-distance terminal and the local telephone offices of the corres-
ponding municipality.
International Service
6.06      The project includes the addition of five 30 kw high frequency
radio transmitters, each equipped for four telephone circuits, and accom-
panied with receivers, antennas, control and power equipment.   It also
includes the establishment of a new receiver station to be located at a
greater distance from Bogota than the existing installation in order to be
less subject to interference.
6.07      To further expand and improve the international telecommunicaticn
services TELECOM has under consideration the installation of a satellite
ground station. During negotiations TELECOM confirmed that it expects
shortly to make arrangements for the detailed planning of thLs installation.
The construction is not included in the Bank-financed project but, for pur-
poses of the overall forecasts of TELECOMIs future financing requirements,
it has been assumed that expenditures would occur in 1969 and 1970.
Other Works
6.08      TELECOM carries out a large number of small routine works in
various parts of the country to expand and improve the telephone, telegraph



- 9 -
and telex serv-.ces. In addition, it has under construction, for completion
during 1967 an, 1968, a number of more important works for which the foreign
currency requirement totals approximately US$3.7 mill-ion equivalent. These
latter works are being financed largely with supplier credits. The more
important of them are the redistribution and expansion of the existing VHF
radio network, additions to existing long-distance switching installations,
and the expansion of the existing telex network.
Engineering, Construction and Initial Operation
6.09      As mentioned in paragraph 3.07, technical assistance is being used
for the development and execution of the program. This includes provision
for the supervision of installation and acceptance of the proposed microwave
systems and for the engineering of future extensions to the Atlantic coast.
6,10      The specifications for the major construction works, such as the
microwave systems and coaxial cable, include provisions that the equipment
supplier will also provide maintenance during the initial period of opera-
tions, establish operating procedures and train TELECOM's maintenance staff.
6.11      Pole-line and open-wire construction is generally carried out by
TELECOM's construction department which is capable of carrying out effi-
ciently this type of work. Any excess amount is put out on contract. Civil
works are, im general, carried out by local contractors under TELECOMts
supervision.
6.1i      These arrangements for engineering, construction and initial
operation of new facilities are satisfactory. A schedule of the estimated
termuiation dates of the various works comprising the expansion program is
shown in Annex 5.
Procurement and DLsbursement
6.13      TELECOM, in general, follows the practice of making its purchases
under usual competitive bidding procedures and all contracts proposed for
Bank financing are to be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidd3ng. In a number of cases, orders have already been awarded. These
total approximately US$4 million. The specifications and analyses of bids
have been submitted to the Bank in order that expenditures might qualify
for reimbursement under the proposed loan, but any retroactivity of relmlburse-
ment would be limited to payments made within three months of the date of
loan approval. Disbursements of the proposed loan would be made against
the actual cost of equipment and services. Should there be any savings over
estimated costs, the unused balance of the loan would be cancelled unless
the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision has to be taken provide
good grounds for applying the savings to additional works. To assure against
delays in procurement being caused by delays in import license procedure,
confirmation was obtained from the Government that import licenses for the
goods to be financed by the Bank would be acted upon promptly.
6.14      Contracts totaling US$307 million have already been placed under
supplier credlt arrangements.

6.16      Firm quotations have been received for more than half the works
comprising the program and have been used in the calculations of the costs
Current prices and quotations for similar installations have been used as
the basis for the estimates of the other works. A reasonable allowance of
85Ga for contingencies has been added to these estimates of costs of importa-
tions of equipment. Estimates of local costs are based on known costs for
similar works increased by 10% annually to provide an allowance for contin-
genicies and price rises  Local costs for engineering wiTll be absorbed in
operating costs.
Future Construction
6 17      Although no detailed plans have been prepared for the continued
expansion of the system after completion of the 1967-70 program, it is
expected that construction expenditures wijll continue at approximately the
same annual level. Provision for such additional construction expenditures
has been made in the financial forecasts.

7. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Accountimg and Audliting
7.01      TELECOM's accounting system is not well designed.  It lacks
costing procedures and does not provide adequate financial information for
management. Responsibility for the accounting function is divided and there
is a lack of coordination0 This arises because of the control exercised by
the Government Auditor, whose approach is aimed at a tight control of trans-
actions rather than the use of accounting as a tool of management. The audit
carried out by the Government Auditor is inadequate and does not satisfy the
Bank's requirements. During loan negotiations TELECOM agreed to appoint
(a) Management Consultants to develop more effective systems
of accounting and financlal control, and
(b) Independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank.
Representatives of local and foreign firms have been interviewed and it is
expected that the necessary appointments would be made within the next few
months.
7.02      The preparation of TELECOM's audlted 1965 Balance Sheet was
seriously delayed and it was not received by the Bank untl January 1967.
The Balance Sheet required some amendments which have been discussed with
TELECOM's Director of Finance. It is not expected that audited financial
statements for the year 1966 will be available until September 1967. During
loan negotiations TELECOM provided assurances that, commencing with the
1967 Balance Sheet and not later than four months after the close of the
fiscal year, it will transmit to the Bank copies of such statements and a
signed copy of the independent accounting firm's report.
Insurance of Facilities
7.03      TELECOM has insufficient insurance coverage but during negotiations
it agreed to examine the adequacy of the insurance coverage of itS major
installations and also to arrange coverage against loss by fire on any build-
ing the estimated replacement cost of which, together with contents, exceeds
Col$5 million.
Tariffs
7.o4      TELECOM derives its revenues from three major sources as follows.
(a) Participation in the revenue from the tariffs charged for
domestic long-distance telephone traffic.
(b) Revenue from domestic service of telex and telegraph
facilities owned by TELECOM.
(c) Participation Ln the revenue from tariffs charged for
both incoming and outgoing international traffic.



- 12 -
Domestlc Lone-aLstance Telephone
7eO5      The tariffs are set by TELECOM's Board subject to approval by the
Minister of Communications0 With the latest tariff increases referred to in
paragraph 7.10 the level of tariffs is presently satisfactory. Since most
of the local telephone networks are owned by municipal and provincial organim-
zations these companies bll1 and collect the originating revenue at the
approved tariff, and pay the collections to TELECOM after deducting their
share of the revenue as follows:
Share of Originating Revenue
Size of Network                      Retained by Connecting Company
Up to 1,000 lines                              33-1/3
From 1,001 to 10,000 lines                     28
From 10 001 and over
(aS Automatic exchange                    25
(b) Manual exchange                       22-1/2
The revenue from domestic long-distance traffic originated by the Government
is collected and retained in full by TELECOM. The net result is that about
22% of total revenues from national long-distance telephone traffic is retained
by the local service comparies. In 1965 this amounted to Col$30-9 million.
7.06      This system and the percentages used were established in a general
agreement reached in 1963 after extended negotiations and after advice had
been obtained from outside experts. The basis for this division of revenues
was not unreasonable as long as most of the long-distance traffic was handled
manually and by relatively low-cost radio installations. However, with the
substantial investments now being planned by TELECOM in a high-quality long-
distance network with facilities for direct dialing, the present basis for
division of revenues may require revision0   During negotiations TELECOM agreed
to engage outside experts to review the long-distance rates and the allocation
of revenues in the light of the new conditions,   It was also agreed that no
modifications of the existimng terms as to division of revenues would be made
without prior consultation with the Bank.
Domestic Telex and Telegrah
7,07      These facilities are owned by TELECOM and originating traffic is
charged at tariffs determined by TELECOM subject to the approval of the
Mimnster of Communications. Although the domestic telex tariff is satis-
factorily priced, the level of domestic telegraph tariff is low. The service
is, however, poor and no early change is contemplated.
International Telephone, Telex and Telegraph Service
7,08      For international services, the tariffs and participations of
revenues are established in contracts which TELECOM has signed with connect-
ing foreign companies. The tariffs are quoted in gold francs in the case of
European countries and dollars in the case of the United States. Histor-
ically the official peso exchange rate was used for determining the
tariffs for traffic originating in Colombia and for settling the accounts



- 13 -
with connecting foreign companies0 In the absence of any adjustment to
reflect the redaction of the value of the peso, TELECOM's revenues from
international traffic became unrealistically low.
7.09      The exchange rate authorized for settlimng participations between
TELECOM and foreign connecting companies and used for the local currency
tariff for international traffic originating in Colombia was Lncreased from
Col$9 to Col$13.50 with effect from October 1, 1966, It is also assumed that
the exchange rate wll be Col$16.30 to the dollar from October 1, 1967, as
referred to in paragraph 7,28, Notwithstanding the rate covenant determining
the level of total revenues as described in paragraph 7.11, the Government
and TELECOM gave assurances during loan negotiations that any future changes
in the exchange rate, applicable to transfers in the capital market, would
within 60 days be reflected by adjustments to the tariffs for international
traffic.
7.10      TELECOM's total earnings during the years 1962 to 1964 were poor
due to the Government delays in approving tariffs sufficient to offset
rising costs, TELECOM applied in September 1963 for increased domestic
tariffs but Government delayed authorLzing the increases until 1965 by
which time the resulting revenue increase was inadequate. However, authority
to approve tariffs has now been delegated to the Minister of Conmrunications,
and this should assist the more expeditious handling of tariff applications
in future. The Government approved a higher exchange rate for settling the
proceeds of international traffic, as already indicated, and approved an
increase in domestic long-distance telephone tariff by approxLmately 25%
effective from October 15, 1966. The resulting revenues are satisfactory.
Detailed tariffs are shown in Annex 6.
7.11      To maintain a sound financial position in the future, the Government
and T2LECOM agreed further that tariff adjustments would be made as necessary
to produce revenues sufficient to achieve a rate of return of not less than
9% on the average net plant in service revalued in accordance with a method
agreed during negotiat ions.
7.12      The revalued amount of net plant in service as of December 31,
1965 was US$27.0 millions as shown below, The peso equivalent is calculated
at the exchange rate of US$1.00 - Col$13.50.

F3nancial Position
7.13      Condensed balance sheets at the end of each of the years 1962-1965
are shown in Annex 8. TELECOM's capitalization at the end of fiscal year
1965, extracted from the 1965 (amended) Balance Sheet was characterized by
the relatively small amount of long term debt compared to the high proportion
of non-dividend paying equity as set out below.

Debt/Equity ratio                             9191
7.14      The low debt/equity ratio reflects TELECOM's difficulty in
arrangLng long term debt. The liability on bonds was assumed by TELECOM
when ownership of TELECOM propertles w as acquired in 1947 (See note 5 to
Annex 8). Local bank loans carrying interest varying between 10% to 20%
per annum are repayable over varying periods up to 5 years. TELECOM's
earlier construction programs have been financed mainly from suppliers'
credits repayable normally within three to seven years. Annex 9 shows
the gross outstanding debt including suppliers' credits at December 31,
1965, together with additional borrowings in 1966.
7.15      Although the telegraph facilities were transferred from the
Ministry of Communications in 1964/65 by virtue of Decree No. 3267 of 1963,
the assets transferred were neither listed nor valued for inclusion into
TELECOM's books. In June 1966, the Government and TELECOM agreed that:
(a) All legal formalities required in connection with the
transfer of the telegraph assets from the Ministry to
TELECOM would be completed before December 31, 1966.
and
(b) TELECOM would make an inventory and valuation of the said
telegraph assets, and would complete this valuation in order
to include the resulting values in its 1966 accounts.
This task has not been completed. However, a working party has been formed
to prepare an inventory and assess values. This work may still require
several months. During loan negotiations an undertaking was obtained from
the Government and TELECOM that the inventory and valuation of telegraph
assets and the legal formalities for their transfer would be completed by
December 31, 1967.



- 15 -
7.16      For each of the years 1962 to 1965 TELECOM's current assets have
slightly exceeded its current liabilities including the current portion of
long term debt. Current assets before deduction of reserves for bad debts
and losses of inventory rose by Col$88.0 million to Col$1h4 million between
1962 and 1965. This ancrease reflects not only the increased demand for
TELECOM's services but also the tariff increases in 1965 as set out in
Annex 6.
7.17      The cash position at the end of each year has been maintained at
a level which has varied between 8% and 13% of the annual operating revenue.
Since TELECOM has some 1,300 offices throughout Colombia it would be prudent
if it could maintain a cash level of not less than 10% of the annual
operating revenue. Government receivables amounting to Col$30.4 million
at the end of 1965 represent about 6 years billings. This large sum has
accumulated because Government had stopped payment of TELECOM's bll1s since
1960.
7.18      During loan negotiations the Government agreed that-
(a) The accLmulated indebtedness for services rendered to
December 31, 1965, would be paid off in three annual
instalments commencing July 1, 1967.
(b) Future bills for TELECOM services would be paid promptly.
The  Colombian Government   has  made  provision   in its 1967 budget
to enable a first installment of Col$5 million to be paid in 1967.
7.19      Other receivables of Col$5203 million at the end of 1965
consists of -
Col$ million
Due from Colombian telephone companies       23.9
Due from overseas entities                    2.7
"   "   other clients                      24.9
unbilled charges                      .8
52.3
The debt from overseas entities represents about one month's collection of
revenue from international traffic but those due from Colombian telephone
companies and other clients' accounts represents between 3 and 4 months
collection of national revenues. Although there is room for improvement
in the system of collection it seems advisable to await the result of the
review to be carried out by Management Consultants.
7.20      It has been a practice for TELECOM to build up a Bad Debts reserve
and an Inventory reserve by appropriations from profit with the object of
showing small profits in the published accounts. The reserves are now
excessive. For purposes of completming the 1965 (amended) balance sheet
the amount of the reserves deducted from current assets have been reassessed
on the basis of 5% of 'Receivables - other' and 'Inventories'. The remain-
ing portion of the reserves have been shown as part of the equity.

Past Operation
7.21      Income Statements showing TELECOMIs results from operations for
the years 1962-65 are shown in Annex 10. This period was characterized by
continuing inflatlon. The following ratios covering the four years 1962-
1965 show poor performance.
1962   1963   1964   1965
Operating ratio                91    _T8W    977    9
Ratio of labor cost to
operating revenue            68     67     77     75
Rate of return                  6     10      2      5
7.22      The problem of excess staff referred to in paragraph 3.06 is
reflected by the increase in the labor ratio to 77% in 1964 following the
Government's decision to transfer the overstaffed telegraph facilities from
the Ministry of Communications to TELECOM, The transfer of the services,
commenced in 1964, was completed by April 1965 when some 4,000 personnel
had been transferred increasing TELECOM's annual operating cost by approxi-
mately Col$60 milllion.  The corresponding annual income was estimated at
only Col$10 mll-ion leaving TELECOI with an annual loss of about Col$50
millilon from these transferred facilities. To partly offset these losses,
the Government agreed to pay TELECOM a total of Col$66 million over 3 years
viz., Col$24 million during 1964, Col$24 million in 1965 and the balance of
Col$18 million in 1966. TELECOM actually received Col$20 million in 1964,
Col$18.7 million in 1965, and Col$18,8 million in 1966, leaving a balance of
Col$8.5 million still to be paid. During loan negotiations assurances were
obtained from the Government that this sum will be paid to TELECOM during
1967.
7.23      The poor level of earnings in 1964 and 1965 has been due to the
serious overstaffing and the rising trend of operating costs without any
significant offsettimng tariff increases.  The long delayed 1965 tarLff
increases were inadequate to meet the increasing operational costs and the
effects of a further peso devaluation from Col$9 to Col$13.50 to the dollar
towards the end of 19650 In 1966 the return was expected to remain low at
about 4.5% because (a) the increased revenue arising from annual growth was
iadequate to meet rising costs, (b) the increased operating expenditure
reflecting the 8% wages award to employees made from January 196b, and
(c) the increased tariffs dld not become operative until October 1966.

7.25      During the four years to December 31, 1970, the total construction
expenditure would amount to Col$557 mill-ion consisting of Col$313 million
for the program to be assisted by the proposed Banlc loan, Col$109 million
for outstanding contracts and routine works, and Col$135 million being
part of a future program to be started in 1969. Under the proposed financing
plan TELECOM would finance about Col$245 million or 44% from internal cash
generation net of debt service requirements.   Col$306.1 mllllon or approxi-
mately 55% would come from borrowings, and Col$38.5 million from Government
payments on account of past bills and the balance of the subsidy for the
telegraph operations.
7.26      The borrowings assumed for the period 1967-1970 are -
(a) The proposed loan of US$16 mill--on, including interest
during construction, covering the foreign exchange cost
of the expansion referred to as the "Bank financed program"
detailed in Annex 7, at an assumed interest rate of 6
percent, and a term of 20 years including a grace period
of 4 years.



- 18 -
(b) Suppliers' credLits for c ontracts already placed.
(c) A foreign exchange loan for other works to be started
in 1969 on sumular terms to a Bank loan.
7.27      Nhile the financing plan is satisfactory it is anticipated that
the cash position will become tight in 1967. To alleviate this position
TELECOM is renegotiating an extension of certain suppliers' credits which
would otherwise fall due for payment in 1967., The sources and application
statement in Annex 11 assumes the successful outcome of this negotiation
and reflects the deferment of amortization of about Col$10 million in 1967
with repayment in 1968 and 1969.
Forecast Future Financial Position
7.28      Forecast income statements for the years 1966-71 are given in
Annex 10. Forecast sources and application of funds for the same period are
shown in Annex 11, and the resulting balance sheets in Annex 8. Operating
income would increase from Col$39.8 million in 1967 to Col$75.7 million in
1971 due mainly to the growth in both national and 3nternational traffic.
Since the exchange rate of Col$16030 to the dollar applicable to transfers
in the capital market is assumed for international service transactions,
this rate is also adopted for the servicing of debt, settling accounts with
foreign entities, and the calculation of the local currency international
tariff from October 1, 1967. The value of imported equipment is governed
by the fluctuating certificate rate. These fluctuations cannot be predicted
and therefore the exchange rate of Col$16.30 has been used for revaluing net
plant in service at the end of 1967. Under the present assumptions TELECOM
would require small tariff adjustments in 1969 and 1970 Ln order to maintaLn
annual returns of at least 9%. However, should the Colombian peso depreciate
further then additional tariff increases would be required to maintain a
satisfactory earnings level.
7.29      Internal cash generation would increase from Col$67.8 mllion im
1967 to Col$128.3 million by 1971. Total debt service would be covered
2.0 times in 1967 rising to 4.0 times in 1971, the first year when the two
half-yearly principal repayments on the proposed Bank loan will be paid.
7.30      During loan negotiations TELECOM agreed to a deot limitation covenant
under which the Borrower will not incur any debt unless its net revenues
(gross revenues, less all operating expenses, but before provision for depre-
ciation, interest and other charges on debt) are 1.7 times the maximum debt
service requirement.  This Lgreed debt limitation would provide adequate pro-
tection for the Bank, it is reasonably in line with other loan agreements
made with Colombla and it should be met without difficulty by TELECOM.
8. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The project is technically sound and will provide efficient long-
distance telephone service between the principal cities of Colombia. In
addition the international telephone and telegraph service as well as the
national telegraph service will be improved and automatic telephone services



- 19 -
will be provided for a number of small towns. The expansion proposed Is
reasonably planned to meet forecast demand for service and will provide a
nationwide communication network needed to facilitate Government adminis-
tration as well as industrial and commercial activities.
8,02      Estimates of costs are reasonable.  Procurement procedures and
financing proposals are satisfactory,
8.03      TELECOM's management is reasonably capable but the organization
is overstaffed. TakLng a realistic view, there is little prospect that
reductions in the number of employees will be made during the construction
period apart from (a) not filling posts as they fall vacant owing to
employees leavimng TELECOM for any reason, and (b) the possibility of
employees being retrained and transferred to work directly connected with
the proposed construction program. TELECOM's accounting system and pro-
cedures need Improvement and the management consultants should prove
especially helpful to provide systems to improve the information required
for better evaluation of financial performance. The tariff increases
effective from October 1966, together with the assumed tariff adjustments
referred to in paragraph 7.28, should produce the required return of not
less than 9%. In the event of further depreciation of the peso, further
tariff adjustment would be required.
8.04      During loan negotiations satisfactory agreements were reached that:
(a) The Bank would be informed promptly of any change in TELECOM
management and as to the competence and experience of new
management (paragraph 3.03).
(b) A program of improvement of personnel utilization would be
adopted and during the construction period the net annual
increase in personnel would be lumited to a maximum of 5%
of the number of employees at the beginnimng of the year
(Paragraph 3.06).
(c) Before a final decision is taken as to the provision of
Important additional facilities for the improvement of inter-
national services, such as a satellite ground station, the
Bank would be provided with all information pertinent to such
decision, including proposed financing arrangements, and given
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (paragraph 6.o7).
(d) Consulting engineers would continue to be engaged for technical
assistance for engineering and execution of the project (para-
graph 6.09).
(e) Applications for import licenses for the goods to be financed by
the Bank would be acted upon promptly (paragraph 6.13).
(f) Management consultants would be engaged by December 31, 1967
to revlew and make recommendations for a more effective system
of accounting and financial control (paragraph 7.01).



- 20 -
(g) Independent auditors would be appointed (paragraph 7.01).
(h) Commencing with the December 31, 1967 Balance Sheet and not lazer
than four months after the close of the fiscal year, TELECOM
would transmit to the Bank certified copies of such financial
statements and a signed copy of the independent accounting firm's
report (paragraph 7.02).
(1) Consultants would be engaged before July 1, 1968 to review and
make recommendations regarding the structure and general level
of national tariffs (paragraph 7.06).
(J) Consultants would be engaged before December 31, 1968 to determine
the most appropriate division of national long-distance telephone
revenues between TELECOM and connecting operating entities and
no modification of the existing contractual terms as to such
dlivision of revenues would be made without prlor consultation
with the Bank (paragraph 7.06).
(k) By October 1, 1967 and thereafter from time to tLme, the Colombian
peso tariffs for international service would be adjusted to
reflect changes in the exchange value of the peso applicable to
transfers in the capital market (paragraph 7.09).
(1) Tariffs would be maintained at a level to produce a rate of
return of not less than 9% on the average net fLxed assets in
service, as valued in accordance with a method which has also
been agreed (paragraph 7.11).
(m) The inventory and valuation of telegraph assets transferred from
the Ministry of Communications to TELECOM and the legal formalities
for their transfer would be conpleted by December 31, 1967 (para-
graph 7.15).
(n) The accumulated indebtedness of the Government for services
rendered to December 31, 1965 would be paid off in annual
installments commencing July 1, 1967 and future accounts would
be kept on a current basis (paragraph 7.18).
(o) Payment would be made during 1967 of the Col$8.5 million balance
due from the Government to compensate TELECOM for losses on
the telegraph operations transferred in 1964 (paragraph 7.22).
(p) The mncurrence of new long-term debt would be reasonably
limited (paragraph 7.30).
8.05     The Project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$16 million for a term of 20 years including a grace period of 4 years.

ENPRESA NACIONAL DE TELECOMUNICACIONES
Notes and Assumptions in Preparing Balance Sheets
1.        The 1965 Balance Sheet submitted to the Bank in January 1967
contained inconsistencies which have been discussed wath TELECOM's Financial
Director. The Bank mission has therefore made the followang amendments for
purposes of presentation of the 1965 amended balance sheet in this report.
a) An amount of Col$65 mllion had been deducted from gross
plant and shown as plant under construction. The amended
balance sheet reinstates the sum as plant in service.
b) TELECOM's gross indebtedness due on bonds, bank obligations,
and suppliers' credits is detailed in Annex 9 which forms
the basis for the entries of long term debt less the current
portlon which is included under current liabilities in the
amended 1965 balance sheet.
c) TELECOM had provided a reserve for bad and doubtful debts of
Col$17.1 million at the end of 1965 which represents over
20% of the gross receivables. Since (1) the Government has
agreed to pay its debts to TELECOM in three annual install-
ments (paragraph 7.18) and (2) the sums of Col$26.6 million
due from Colombian and Overseas telephone entities will be
paid, the probability of bad debts need only be considered in
respect of the balance of Col$25.7 million. A revised reserve
of 5% of these receivables, i.e., Col$1.3 million, is assumed
for deduction from gross receivables of Col$52.3 million. The
amended balance sheet shows the revised figure of Col$51.0
million, and the balance of the Bad Debts reserve has been trans-
ferred to Reserve and Surplus.
d) Similarly the reserve against loss of inventory had accumulated
to Col$7.4 million by the end of 1965. This represents 10%
of the value of all inventories including construction inven-
tories of Col$54.5 million. Since inventory losses charged
against the reserve have been insignificant in the past few
years, a reserve of 5% of the value of inventory, say Col$l
million would be adequate. The sum of Col$18.6 millilon for
inventories is therefore shown under current assets in the
1965 amended balance sheet and the balance of the reserve, viz.,
Col$6.4 million is included under equity.
e) The amount of Col$10.1 million shown as a current liability
due to the Minibstry of Communrcation represents work done, etc.,
by TELECOM for Government but paid out of monies advanced by, but
regarded as refundable to Government, TELECOM has indicated
that the Government will not rvqu±re payment and the amount is
to be written back. This adjustment has been assumed.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
f) The opportunity has been taken to incorporate into the
1965 amended balance sheet the revised local currency
value of' net plant in service converted at the exchange
rate of Col$13.50 to the dollar calculated in accordance
with the method agreed with TELECOM for the purpose of
assessing the 9% return.
g) The depreciation reserve has been revalued using the
straight line method based on a composite rate of 4-1/2%
of the average gross plant in service (including non-
depreciable assets),
2.        The exchange rate of Col$16.30 to the dollar, applicable to transfers
in the capital market, is assumed from October 1, 1967 for calculating the
value of net plant in service and foreign indebtedness.
3.        The authorized capital was Col$400 million. The sum of Col$95
million was originally subscribed by the Colombian Government. In 1961,
the issued capital was raised to Col$100 million by a further Government
contribution and to Col$120.7 million in 1964 by a transfer from reserves.
The new TELECOM statutes dated April 5, 1966 indicate that TELECOM is owned
by the Colombian Government and no further reference is made to the capital
structure.

5.        Prior to 1947 most long distance telephone services in Colombia
were provided oy Companma Telefonica Central S,A. In 1947 this Companyts
concession expired and its assets were acquired by the Government through
the issue of interest free U.S. Dollar Bonds. The liability for these
bonds was assumed by TELECOM in 1950 when it took over ownership of the
telecommunication properties. The bonds were issued in two series, the
first for US$2,687,719 Ln payment of physical plant, the second for
US$103,374 for materials and supplies. These two services are being repaid
in half-yearly installments of US$451,696 and US$42,777, respectively, with
final payments on April 1, 1963 and April 1, 1964, respectively.

Notes on the Income Statement - Annex 10
1.        The 1966 operating revenue and expenses are based on figures
prepared by TELECOII because the audlted 1966 final accounts are not available.
2.        The local currency tariff for international traffic originating
in Colombia was increased with effect from October 1, 1966, in accordance
with Government agreement during negotiations to base the tariff on the
intermediate rate of exchange of Col$13.50 to the dollar instead of the
preferential rate of Col$9.0 to the dollar. Similarly this revised exchange
rate is also used for the settlement of accounts between international entities.
3.        The income statement includes the effect of a further increase of
the local currency tariffs for international traffic, effective October 1,
1967, to reflect the new exchange rate of Col$16830 to the dollar, appl2cable
to transfers in the capital market.
4.        The rates for the annual growith of traffic applying equally to
traffic originating in Colombia, as well as to traffic to Colombia originating
from other countries are assumed as follows:
(a) For International Traffic
Telephone - 12-1/2% pea. from 1965 to 1968, then
20% for 1969, and 15% thereafter
Telex     - 15% increase per annum
Telegraph - 10S increase per annum
The share of revenue payable by TELECOM to foreign entities for
international traffic originating in Colombia is assumed at 54%.
(b) National Traffic
Long Distance Telephone - 10% increase per annum with
participations due to other
telephone companies assessed at 22%
Telex                   - 25% increase in 1967, 20% increase
in 1968 and 10% per annum thereafter
