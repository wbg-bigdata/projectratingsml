1. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR J1
Contribution to the Economy
1.01       Since the early 1960s, the industrial sector, and more specifi-
cally manufacturing,/2 has been the engine of growth of the Korean economy.
Over the period 1974-78, the manufacturing sector has grown at an average of
17.5% p.a. in real terms compared to an average 11% growth of aggregate GNP.
In 1979, the growth rate of the manufacturing sector slowed to 10.6%, still
higher than the 7.1% growth of real GNP. The share of manufacturing in total
GNP has increased from 25.2% in 1974 to 32.7% in 1979. In 1975, for the first
time the share of manufacturing in total real GNP exceeded that of agricul-
ture; by 1979, agriculture accounted for only 18.8% of GNP compared to 32.7%
for manufacturing. In 1979, seasonally adjusted manufacturing employment
reached 3.1 million /3 and accounted for 22.9% of the total employed
population compared to 15.9% in 1973. Over the five-year period 1975-79,
approximately 1.1 million jobs have been created in the manufacturing sector;
this represented 53.6% of total net employment creation during that period.
1.02      Export Orientation and Export Dependence.  Korea-s success in
economic development is largely based on a strategy of export promotion with
emphasis on manufactured exports. Total commodity exports just exceeded US$10
billion in current prices in 1977 but reached US$15.1 billion in 1979. The
volume of Korea-s exports doubled between 1975 and 1978. The growth rate of
commodity exports slowed in real terms to about 15.8% p.a. over the
period 1977-78 compared to an average of 32.7% p.a.  over the period 1972-76.
In 1979, the nominal value of exports reached $15.1 billion, 18.4% higher than
in 1978; in real volume terms, however, this represented a 0.9% decline over
1978.
1.03      Manufactured products, which accounted for about 52% of total
exports in 1964, have gradually increased their share and have remained at
about 90% since 1976. Gradual changes have taken place in the structure of
manufactured exports over the past three years: light manufactured products
including textiles have declined in relative terms from 52.7% of total exports
in 1977 to 50.4% in 1979; heavy industry products have increased their share
from 32.8% in 1977 to 38.6% in 1979. However, some of Korea-s traditional
light exports such as footwear and clothing have remained buoyant. The
changing composition of Korean exports reflects the significant changes which
have taken place in recent years in the structure of the manufacturing sector.
/1 Chapters 1 and 2 are verbatim reproductions of the industrial and finan-
cial sector write-ups contained in the Staff Appraisal Report on the
Korea Development Bank.
/2 In 1979, manufacturing alone accounted for 96% (in 1975 prices) of total
value added in the industrial sector (i.e. mining and manufacturing).
/3 Compared to 4.9 million in agriculture.



1.04      It is estimated that export expansion contributed about 35% of the
growth in manufacturing output over the period 1975-77 against 74% for
domestic demand./l The real growth rate of the manufacturing sector was
higher than that of exports in both 1978 and 1979, which, to some extent,
reflects the growing demand for manufactured goods in the domestic market.
Domestic demand has been expanding very rapidly in the past few years as a
result of sharply rising incomes. A major investment boom, particularly in
housing and manufacturing, started in 1977 and was an important element of the
growing domestic demand. Excessive demand in the domestic market relative to
the supply of goods increased inflationary pressures in 1978-79 and encouraged
danestic sales in preference to exports. The erosion of the competitiveness
of Korea's exports resulting from inflationary pressures coupled with a
weakness in external demand contributed to a substantial deficit in the 1979
balance of payments. In the long run, however, rising domestic demand may
prove a favorable development considering that, until 1977,the export
dependence of the manufacturing sector had been growing faster than planned.
The ratio of manufactured exports to output reached 26.9% in 1977 with
considerable variations in the dependence ratio of the various subsectors./2
Structural Changes in Manufacturing
1.05      The growth of the manufacturing sector has been accompanied by
significant adjustments in the importance of the various component subsectors
as shown in the following table:
/1 Import substitution made a negative (-9%) contribution.
/2 The export output ratio reached a level of 67% for wood and furniture and
91% for some miscellaneous products in 1977.

1.06      The composition of manufacturing shows a marked shift in favor of
heavy industry whose share of total manufacturing value added exceeded 50% for
the first time in 1978. The most significant gains have been registered by
the machinery sector. The rate of growth of chemical industries, however,
lagged behind so that the sector declined from about 30% in 1970 to 22.5% in
1978. Light industries have declined steadily since 1970. The sharpest
declines were recorded in the food, beverage and tobacco sector. Textiles
have been maintaining their 16-17% share of total manufacturing value added.
The changes in the structure of manufacturing reflect a deliberate policy to
shift production gradually from Korea's traditional light industrial
production towards more skill- and technology-intensive types of production.
Geographic Distribution
1.07      The 1975 population census showed that approximately 27% of the
population of Korea lived in the cities of Seoul and Busan; the province of
North Gyeongsang in which Taegu, the third largest industrial city is located,



-4-
accounted for another 14%. The following table shows that the regional
distribution of manufacturing enterprises and employment is skewed in favor of
Seoul and Busan.

While Seoul and Busan remain the largest industrial centers, marginal improve-
ments have taken place between 1974 and 1977 in the redistribution of indus-
trial employment outside these areas. This may be the first sign that
government policies aimed at a better distribution of employment are having
an impact. Government policies aiming at reducing the congestion of Seoul and
Busan include severe restrictions on industrial expansion in these two cities,
a program of financial assistance for the relocation of industries, the
promotion of new industrial estates such as the Pohang, Ulsan and Yeosu
complexes and the Saemaeul Movement, initiated in 1971, for creating off-farm
employment in rural areas.
Factor Use and Efficiency
1.08      The main elements which have contributed to the rapid expansion of
the manufacturing sector are (a) a high rate of investment and (b) efficiency
in factor use, both capital and labor.
1.09      Gross Fixed Capital Formation.  Real fixed investment increased
sharply by an average of 33% p.a. over the two-year period 1977-78 and slowed
down to 9.6% in 1979. As a result, the ratio of gross fixed capital formation
to GNP rose in real terms from 25.9% in 1976 to 37.1% in 1978 and edged up
further in 1979 to 38%. Housing and manufacturing were the leading investment
sectors. Manufacturing investment increased by a phenomenal 63.4% in real
terms in 1978 and a further 17.4% in 1979. As a share of total fixed
investment, manufacturing reached 38% in 1979 compared to an average of 21.9%
over the period 1975-77. Within manufacturing, a major part of investment was
directed towards fulfilling ambitious government targets for heavy industry.
Heavy industry accounted for 78.9% of total manufacturing investment in



-5-
1977-79. Investment in light industry accounted for the remaining 21.1% and
lagged significantly behind the Fourth Plan targets. Investment in heavy
industrial projects with long gestation periods did not lead to an immediate
increase of productive capacity and contributed to aggravating the imbalance
between domestic demand and supply. Indications are also that investment in
heavy industries has exceeded in some instances the levels dictated by market
size, financing capacity and technical capability. Overinvestment is already
apparent in certain branches of industry. In view of these structural problems
and of the overheating of the economy to which investment in some heavy
industries contributed, the Government has taken steps to delay, scale down or
cancel several investment projects. An Investment Project Coordinating
Committee was set up in 1979 to review investment priorities and projects and
to pursue rationalization steps.
1.10      Factor Efficiency.  Efficiency in factor use has contributed to the
high performance of the Korean manufacturing sector. Calculations of incre-
mental capital to output ratios (ICORs) with a one-year lag show a gradual
decline over the three consecutive periods 1961-66, 1966-71 and 1971-75,
indicating increasing efficiency in the use of capital investment. Inclusion
of data for 1976 and 1977 raises the ICOR estimate to 1.012/1 for the period
1971-77 compared to 0.977 /1 for the period 1971-75. This may reflect the
higher capital intensity of manufacturing investment in recent years because
of the larger share of the heavy and chemical sectors. Efficiency in capital
utilization is also evidenced by the rapid growth in industrial capacity
utilization over 1971-77; over the past two years, however, excess capacity
has appeared in some branches of industry. Labor productivity measured by the
ratio of value added per employee has also been increasing in all manufactu-
ring subsectors over the period 1970-76 and was sufficient to absorb wage
increases. Over the period 1977-79, however, productivity gains have lagged
behind the rapid growth in real wages. Rising labor costs have contributed to
the decline in the competitiveness of Korean exports in 1978-79.
Financial Structure of Enterprises
1.11      The tight controls exercised by the Government on credit allocation
by financial institutions have enabled the direction of investment patterns
according to national priorities. The system of preferential credits has also
encouraged excessive credit demand and has resulted in the very high
indebtedness of manufacturing enterprises. The average aggregate debt/equity
ratio of manufacturing enterprises which stood at 2.7:1 in 1973 following the
financial measures of 1972, has increased steadily and reached 3.7:1 in 1978
to 3.6:1 over the period 1976-78. The long-term debt/equity ratio, however,
reached only 1.5:1 in 1978, reflecting an excessively large share (58%) of
short-term borrowings in total debt. The 1979-80 economic recession has
induced greater reliance on short-term borrowings to finance inventory build
up. The average aggregate debt/equity ratio of manufacturing enterprises is
now estimated at about 4:1. The average interest rate paid on borrowings,
short- and long-term, ranged from 12% to 13% over the period 1976-78.
Profitability measured in terms of net income to total assets has declined
marginally from 3.2% in 1976 to 2.7% in 1978 but remained satisfactory.

Industrial Policies
1.12      The phenomenal growth of the manufacturing sector was, to a large
extent, made possible by efficient and pragmatic government policies.
Incentive packages have been developed and adjusted over time to fit evolving
priorities for industrial development. With variable emphasis, policies have
aimed at the promotion of export industries, import substitution, assistance
to small and medium enterprises, geographic dispersal of industry and in the
last few years, promotion of skill-intensive sectors with a higher
technological content. Export promotion has been the major objective since
the early sixties. Subsidies on exports have continued to increase in
absolute terms over the period 1975-78 but were insufficient to compensate for
the loss of competitiveness induced by Korea's higher prices relative to its
major trading partners. As a result, the real effective exchange rate
deteriorated sharply for Korean exporters over that period.
1.13      Export Incentive System.  Government incentives to exporting
industries include tax exemption, accelerated depreciation allowances, refund
of import duties on raw materials used for export production, deferred payment
of tariffs on equipment and access to subsidized credit. These incentives are
administered within the framework of an export targeting system whereby
exporting firms set for themselves certain export targets in agreement with
overall government objectives. A monthly conference is held to review and
adjust targets as well as government policies affecting their implementation.
1.14      While the emphasis has clearly been on export promotion, key import
substitution industries have received substantial government support in the
form of partial tax and tariff exemptions, as well as protection from
competing imports. Production for the domestic market, however, has generally
been subject to higher duties, taxes, and interest charges on borrowings. In
1977-78, the Government relaxed a number of import restrictions as part of an
import liberalization program to be implemented over a four-year period.
Banned items have been abolished; since January 1, 1979, 69% of all import
items are subject to automatic approval, 31% are "restricted"./l Tariff
adjustments have also been introduced to improve the competitiveness of import
substituting industries. The simple average tariff rate has been reduced from
36% to 25%.
Recent Performance
1.15      The rapid growth of the Korean economy during 1977-78 was followed
by a recession in 1979. Real GNP growth rate slowed in 1979 to 6.4%, compared
to an average of 10.9% p.a.  over the period 1977-78.  Exports stagnated and a
large deficit of $4.2 billion was recorded in the current account of the
balance of payments. Over-expansion of the economy in the period 1976-78
linked with international recession and protectionism may be the root cause of
/1 In early 1978, 54% of all items were subject to automatic approval,
41% were restricted and 5% were banned.

the lackluster performance of 1979. The overheating of the economy resulted
from expanding incomes and excessive domestic demand, particularly investment
demand. In order to quell inflationary pressures, the Government implemented
in 1978-79 an import liberalization and stabilization program which included
tight monetary and fiscal policies. The resulting slowdown of Lhe economy was
sharper than expected because of the continued stagnation of exports and high
level of inflation. Further economic adjustments were made in January 1980:
the Won was devalued by 16.4% relative to the US dollar, interest rates were
raised by 6 percentage points and domestic energy prices increased
dramatically.
1.16      The industrial sector provided the major impetus to GNP growth over
the period 1977-79. The growth of the manufacturing sector reached an average
of 17.5% in real terms over the period 1977-78 but slowed down to 10.6% in
1979. Industry was hard hit by cost-push inflation and by the economic
recession of 1979. Seasonally adjusted industrial output in the final quarter
of 1979 was 4% below the first quarter level. Tightness in the labor market
pushed up unit labor costs by over 20% p.a. during 1977-79 and real wages by
16% p.a. Real wage increases have substantially outstripped productivity
gains in recent years and caused an erosion of Korea's comparative advantage
in the labor-intensive manufactures which still dominate its exports.
Prospects
1.17      The latest Economic Management Plan of the Government estimates GNP
growth rates of 3% and 7.5% in 1980 and 81 respectively. Over the same
period, industrial sector growth rates are expected to be 2.8% and 9.1%.
Overall investment is projected to decline by 8% in real terms in 1980.
1.18      In spite of the current difficulties, Korea's long-term growth
potential remains favorable. Continued stimulation of exports at about
12% p.a. over 1980-81 is crucial for recovery in the economy. At the same
time, some restructuring of the economy, particularly in the industrial
sector, seems desirable to improve efficiency. Korea's shift from labor-
intensive towards skill-intensive industries ought to be pursued but
investments in heavy industry need to be carefully reviewed and rationalized
to avoid overinvestment and excess productive capacity.
2. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
2.01      The unparalleled expansion of Korean industry since the early 1960s
was made possible by an ambitious investment program coupled with pragmatic
financial sector policies. The financial system effectively supported the



-8-
growth of industry by mobilizing the necessary foreign and domestic savings
and by efficiently channeling these resources toward industrial investment.
As a result, Korea's financial sector and institutions have expanded rapidly.
From the outset, however, financial institutions and funding mechanisms have
been kept under tight government control to ensure the allocation of resources
to predetermined priority areas. The system has worked well in the past
decade; there is, however, some concern about its ability to respond effi-
ciently and flexibly to the requirements of an increasingly complex and
sophisticated economy.
Financing Gross Domestic Capital Formation
2.02      The rapid growth of manufacturing investment over the period 1977-
79 was made possible by an equally rapid growth of long-term loans /1 extended
by Korean financial institutions to the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing
fixed investment increased by an average of 45% p.a. in current prices over
1977-79 and net term lending /2 by an average of 52% p.a. The rapid growth of
debt financing suggests that financing patterns have remained substantially
unchanged over the past three years and that Korean industries have kept a
high level of indebtedness (para. 1.11). Recent Bank surveys of the financing
of the industry in Korea indicate that, on average,self-financing by Korean
enterprises accounts for only 30% of investment /3 and the remainder is
covered by borrowings. This financing pattern stems largely from the
availability of debt financing at a low cost relative to other types of
funding.
2.03      Current price fixed investment in manufacturing amounted to W 2,174
billion in 1979. Assuming that self-financing accounted for 30%, external
debt financing provided the balance, namely W 1,522 billion. External finance
was in the form of borrowings from domestic financial institutions and from
noninstitutional sources (capital markets, borrowings from abroad and
unorganized money market). In 1979, incremental term lending by Korean
financial institutions to the manufacturing sector amounted to W 1,067 billion
or 70% of the external financing estimated above. Noninstitutional sources
provided the balance of W 455 billion, of which about half was generated
through issuance of corporate debentures in the securities market and the
other half from foreign commercial loans and suppliers- credits./4

term fixed investment is financed out of long-term resources; in fact,
the high short-term indebtedness of Korean industry suggests that short-
term debt is used in part to finance fixed assets and rolled over.

2.04      The above figures indicate that approximately 50% of manufacturing
fixed investment in 1979 was financed by Korean financial institutions, while
self-financing accounted for 30% and noninstitutional sources for the
remaining 20%. The relative importance of the various Korean financial
institutions in supplying long-term funds (defined as loans with a maturity
exceeding one year) for industry is shown in the following table:

The Korea Development Bank (KDB) is the single largest source of term finance
for industry. Commercial banks come next, having in certain years provided
in aggregate more funding with a maturity exceeding one year than KDB.
However, term lending by the commercial banks is usually for working capital
rather than equipment financing and for shorter maturities than KDB's (four to
five years on average compared to eight years for KDB). The General Banking
Act limits the maturity of commercial bank term lending to ten years. The
Korea Exchange Bank has also become an important source of term finance for
export industries. The Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC), however,
has seen its contribution gradually erode from 14% in 1974 down to 4% in 1979
(Annex A, Table 1).
2.05      While commercial banks are an important source of funding with a
maturity exceeding one year for industry, their main activity is the supply of
short- and medium-term working capital funds. In fact, term lending by
commercial banks has remained through the 1970s well below the potential
afforded by available term resources such as time and savings deposits (TSD)
and equity. Extensive rollover of short-term loans de facto increases term
lending but is somewhat less suitable for financing fixed investment.
Incremental short-term loans of commercial banks to manufacturing reached
W 2,761 billion in the period 1977-79 compared to W 530.2 billion for



- 10 -
long-term loans. Looking at the aggregate short- and long-term resources
flowing to industry over 1977-79, commercial banks accounted for 60%; KDB was
the next largest supplier with 14.8% (Annex A, Table 2).
Institutional Sources of Funds
2.06      The institutional set-up of the Korean financial sector can be
divided into (a) banking (or monetary) institutions which accept deposits from
the general public and (b) nonbank financial institutions. Banking institu-
tions /1 comprise conventional commercial banks, including branches of foreign
banks, and six specialized banks./2 The operations of commercial banks are
directly supervised by the Bank of Korea (BOK) while specialized banks are
under the control of the Ministry of Finance (MOF).
2.07      Annex A Table 3 shows the assets structure of the Korean financial
system. Over the period 1975-79, some deepening of the financial sector has
taken place as reflected by the growing importance of nonbank institutions.
The share of nonbank financial institutions in the total gross assets of the
financial sector reached 26.2% in 1979 compared to 23% in 1975. This sign
of maturity notwithstanding, the banking system including BOK still
accounted for 73.8% of the sector's total assets in 1979; BOK and the
commercial banks together accounted for 51% of total financial sector
assets.
2.08      The Commercial Banks.  The commercial banking sector in Korea com-
prises: (a) five government controlled commercial banks with a nationwide
network of branches; (b) ten private banks with operations localized in each
province; and (c) branches of foreign commercial banks. Commercial banks
are subject to the provisions of the General Banking Act. In aggregate, the
assets of commercial banks accounted for 38.9% of the total assets of the
financial sector in 1979, up from 37.7% in 1975; the 1979 component ratio of
38.9% could be broken down into 31.5% for the five nationwide banks, 4.1%
for the ten regional banks and 3.3% for branches of foreign banks. The
commercial banking group remains by far the largest source of funds for the
manufacturing sector, but its importance has been slowly declining over time
in relative terms. The commercial banks accounted for 54.7% of the increase
in outstanding loans to the manufacturing sector in 1979 compared to 73% in
1974. Their operations, however, are heavily skewed towards short-term
/1   Also referred to as "deposit money banks" (DMBs).
/2 The Korean Exchange Bank for foreign trade; the Small and Medium Industry
Bank for SMI; the Citizens National Bank for consumer finance and SSI;
the Korea Housing Bank for housing finance; the National Agricultural
Cooperative Federation for agricultural credits and the National Fisher-
ies Cooperative.

lending, in part, because they lack the expertise required to carry out
the appraisal of long-term investment proposals. In 1977, short-term loans
accounted for approximately 97% of the increase in the total commercial
banks portfolio; in 1979, the ratio was still as high as 70%.
2.09      Deposits represent the major source of funds of commercial banks.
In 1978, demand and savings deposits together accounted for 54.3% of
total aggregate liabilities (including equity). This ratio was substantially
lower than the 71.1% reached in 1970. Demand deposits had marginally
increased their share of total resources to 21.4% in 1978, but time and
savings deposits had declined steadily from 52.4% in 1970 to 32.9% (Annex A,
Table 4). This sharp decline could be related to the 1972 reduction in
interest rates and the negative real deposit rates which resulted.
2.11      Specialized Banks.  The six specialized banks were created by
the Government in the 1960s to service particular economic sectors. The
specialized banks were established under separate legislation. They are not
subject to the General Banking Act and lie outside the jurisdiction of the
Central Bank-s regulations. Their operations are supervised directly by
MOF. Their aggregate assets accounted for 22.6% of the total assets of the
financial sector in 1979, down from 23.6% in 1975. The Korea Exchange Bank,
which was established in 1967 to take over the commercial foreign exchange
transactions of BOK, accounts for more than half the total assets of
specialized banks. Demand and savings deposits represent the main source of
funds of specialized banks; they accounted for 58% of total liabilities /1 and
equity at end-1979.
2.11      Nonbank Financial Institutions.  The declining share of the monetary
system, i.e., specialized banks, commercial banks, and BOK /2 in the total
assets of the financial sector reflects a certain deepening of the financial
system and the growing importance of nonbank financial intermediaries. The
average annual growth rate of the assets of nonbank financial institutions,
reached 17.2% in real terms over the period 1975-79 compared to an average of
13.7% for the financial sector as a whole. Their share of total assets
consequently increased from 23.2% in 1975 to 26.2% in 1979. Nonbank financial
intermediaries comprise: (a) four development banks /3; (b) the trust account
of the Bank of Seoul and Trust; (c) life and nonlife insurance companies; (d)
short-term finance companies (STFC); (e) mutual savings and finance companies;
(f) postal savings accounts; and (g) securities firms. Of the seven types of
/1 Excluding guarantees issued and outstanding.
/2 BOK's share of financial sector assets declined from 15.5% in 1975 to
12.4% in 1979.
/3 The Korea Development Bank; the Korea Development Finance Corporation;
the Korea Export-Import Bank; and the Korea Land Development Corporation,
formerly the Land Bank.



- 12 -
nonbank intermediaries, development banks constitute the largest group,
accounting for 59% of the total assets of nonbank financial intermediaries in
1979.
2.12      The Bank Group is associated with the two development banks which
are active in the industrial sector: KDB and the KDFC./1 The
Government-owned KDB is the largest financial institution in Korea. As the
principal agent of government long-term funding programs, it deals primarily
with large public and private sector enterprises in power, transportation and
manufacturing. The privately owned KDFC also finances relatively large
industrial enterprises but only in the private sector.
Noninstitutional Sources of Funds
2.13      Noninstitutional sources of funds include (a) the unorganized money
market (UMM) which is primarily a source of short-term resources; (b) direct
corporate borrowings from outside Korea; and (c) the Korean capital market.
Estimates of the importance of the UMM are made difficult by the very nature
of the transactions undertaken and by the fact that a substantial part of the
lending operations of STFCs actually utilize "recycled" UMM resources. Among
foreign sources of funds, medium-term suppliers' and buyers- credits provide
substantial resources for Korean industries (Annex A, Table 5). These direct
borrowings from abroad are classified as a noninstitutional source of funds
but their availability is usually dependent upon a counterguarantee from a
local financial institution.
2.14      Other noninstitutional sources of funds comprise direct foreign
equity investments and the securities market. Direct foreign investments
are restricted by the Government to specific sectors; they amounted to US$124
million in 1979. The stock and bond markets, particularly the latter, have
developed over the past few years into important sources of finance for the
manufacturing sector. The importance of the stock market as a source of
term finance has fluctuated during the 1970s. Stock market activity expanded
rapidly through the mid-70s as a result of government incentives to induce
firms to go public. The main incentive was in the form of a 13% tax differ-
ential between closed and listed firms. This differential has been reduced
to 5% in 1978. New listings increased by 10% only in 1978 and the number of
listed companies actually declined to 355 in 1979. Trading also declined and
the stock price index plummeted from 207.2 at end-1978 to 169.1 at end-1979.
Funds raised by manufacturing enterprises on the stock market amounted to
W 141.1 billion in 1978 and W 107.3 billion in 1979.
/1 The Bank has also made three loans to SMIB and a first loan to CNB in
1980. Both institutions are considered as deposit money banks because
they accept deposits from the general public. However, a substantial
part of their operations is, in fact, development financing.



- 13 -
2.15      Since 1977, the corporate bond market has been supplying more
resources /1 to the manufacturing sector than the stock market. The value of
new bond issues has been increasing at an average of 80% p.a. over 1977-79.
New offerings reached W 465.2 billion in 1979. The effective yield of
corporate bonds varies from 33.5% to 36.6% p.a. for a 2-year maturity
following the January 1980 reform of the interest rate structure. The rapid
growth of the bond market is, to a large extent, due to the favorable tax
treatment granted to bond buyers.
Government Control and Direction
2.16      The development of Korea's economy over the past 20 years has been
directed by comprehensive governmental planning designed to influence private
sector decisions and to provide the means, including finance, for their imple-
mentation. Strict control over the financial system has thus been viewed by
the Government as an efficient tool for enforcing tactical decisions within
the economic development strategy. The operations of the financial sector are
characterized by close government controls on the day-to-day management of the
institutions, on their funding and on their allocative function. The Govern-
ment directly owns controlling participations in the share capital of four of
the five nationwide commercial banks and indirectly controls the fifth one.
The Government also has majority holdings in the six specialized banks and is
in full control of the Korea Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank. The
top management of these institutions is usually appointed directly by the
highest authority on the basis of recommendations by the Minister of Finance.
Altogether, the BOK, the five commercial banks, the six specialized banks, KDB
and Exim Bank account for more than 80% of the assets of the financial system.
KDFC is the only major development institution which is wholly privately
owned.
2.17      Government controls on fund mobilization by the financial sector are
exercised in various ways: (a) the Government is the main participant in the
share capital increases of commercial and specialized banks; (b) the
Government supplements DMB and KDB resources with funds earmarked from the
budget and from special funding programs such as the National Investment Fund
(NIF);/2 (c) BOK has opened rediscounting facilities for DMBs, the main one
being short-term export credits; and (d) the Government administers interest
rates on deposits and other instruments of mobilization such as bonds and
debentures. The administrative controls extend beyond government-owned
institutions as nonbank financial institutions such as KDFC and the short-term
/1 On the basis of gross offerings; no information is available on
redemptions.
/2 Annex C to the KDB Staff Appraisal Report provides a detailed description
of the NIF program; para. 2.22 of this report gives a summarized analysis.



- 14 -
finance companies are expected to "follow" the interest rates set for DMIBs.
Numerous controls also exist on the operations of the securities market.
2.18      Directed Credit.  Government controls are pervasive in the area of
fund allocation. The administrative guidelines on "Uses of Funds in the
Financial Sector" issued by the Monetary Board in 1958 have increasingly been
replaced by specific directives to DMBs and KDB regarding not only the alloca-
tion of government funds but also the allocation of their own resources to
specific priority sectors, subsectors and sometimes individual projects or
firms. The system of directed lending which is administered by BOK and MOF
provides financing at government behest to recognized prime borrowers and,
therefore, severely limits the discretion exercised by financial institutions
in fund allocation. The proportion of Government-directed lending has been
estimated at about 40% of total DMB lending./l
2.19       Subsidized Credit.  An important feature of directed credits is the
low interest rate charged on most of the loans, a notable exception being the
small industry loans of commercial banks. At least half of the directed loans
of DMBs are at concessional rates (i.e., below the normal rate for
nonpriority borrowers)./2 Export credits and the NIF program are the main
components of subsidized lending by the DMBs and KDB. A rising share of DMB
subsidized lending (from 40% in 1971 to 56% in 1978) is for short-term export
financing. NIF lending had also increased from 9% of DMB subsidized lending
in 1975 to 20% in 1977 (Annex A, Table 6). NIF loans accounted for 38% of
KDB's loan portfolio at end-1979 up from 29% at end-1977.
2.20      Export financing is given the highest priority by the Government
because export growth is crucial to the Korean economy. The availability of
concessional loans for exports is viewed as equalizing the position of Korean
exporters with international competitors. These loans are channelled through
the commercial banks and can be rediscounted with BOK for 80% of their value.
Handling banks receive an interest spread of 5 percentage points. The final
lending rate of 9% p.a. was raised to 12% in January 1980 and will increase
to 15% p.a. by end-1980. By comparison, the prime lending rate for short-
term loans was raised to 24.5% p.a. in January 1980.
2.21      Operation of the NIF started in 1974.  Total NIF loans outstanding
reached W 1,228 billion ($2.5 billion) at end-1979. Contributions by
banking institutions out of their deposit resources supply approximately
75% of total NIF funding. NIF loans are available primarily for financing
equipment purchases with a maximum maturity of 8 years. The NIF program

- 15 -
aims at supporting the restructuring of the industrial sector and therefore
places emphasis on assistance to heavy and chemical industries. The
commercial banks, the specialized banks and KDB allocate NIF loans; at
end-1979 they accounted respectively for 18.2%, 15.9% and 65.9% of outstanding
NIF loans. Final lending rates were raised in January 1980 to 21-22% compared
to a nonconcessional rate for term loans of 24.5-25.5%. Handling banks
operate with a positive spread of 0.5% to 1.5%; the interest rate subsidy is
absorbed by the Government.
Efficacy of the Control System
2.22      The efficacy of government controls over the financial system must
be judged in terms of (a) impact on financial intermediation; (b) efficiency
of resource allocation by institutions; and (c) internal efficiency of
intermediaries. These three elements are obviously interrelated.
2.23      Financial intermediation is dependent upon the mobilization of
sufficient savings. The ratio of aggregate savings to GNP exceeded 25%
through most of the period 1970-79, reaching 35% in 1979. Korea's savings
performance has been high by most international standards. The ratio of time
and savings deposits to GNP, however, dropped from 23.3% in 1973 to 21.3% in
1974-79. Equity resources and term deposits are the main source of term
funding for the commercial and specialized banks. The slow growth of TSD,
therefore, affected the capability of these institutions to function as
efficient financial intermediaries. TSD interest rates are determined by the
Government and have, in real terms, been close to zero or negative since 1972.
Low interest rates on financial instruments have caused some financial
disintermediation in'the household sector whereby household savings have been
diverted from deposits into real estate acquisition. The January 1980 upward
adjustment of interest rates partly remedied this situation and was followed
by a sharp increase in aggregate TSD. Another element of government control
on financial intermediation has been the push toward lengthening the
maturities of loans by Deposit-Money Banks to expand capital formation. As a
result, term lending by commercial banks has increased in absolute and
relative terms through the 1970s but has apparently failed to reach the
potential afforded by available term resources.
2.24      The allocational efficiency of the system of directed lending has
been satisfactory in terms of aggregate flow of funds toward the priority
areas of export and heavy industry. It appears, however, that the magnitude
of interest subsidies has resulted in excess demand for debt financing and may
have led to some misallocation of funds within the too broadly defined
priority areas. Favored access to financing for ill-defined priority
borrowers may have led to suboptimal investment decisions with respect to
product choice, scale of production and capital intensity. Excessive credit
expansion has also fueled inflation and has encouraged a high level of
indebtedness in the corporate sector. The high indebtedness of Korean
industry appears to be worrisome owing particularly to the high proportion of
short term debt resulting from easy access to cheap export credits.



- 16 -
2.25      The combination of excess loan demand and government-directed
lending has had a detrimental impact on the internal efficiency of intermedi-
aries. The ability of banks to undertake adequate appraisals and to exercise
proper business judgment has been restricted. Competition among financial
institutions has been severely limited. As a consequence, the transaction
costs of commercial banks are high and bad loans are reportedly kept at an
artificially low level through reschedulings, refinancing of arrears and
rollover of debt.
2.26      Critics of the operations of the Korean financial sector recognize
that the system has, in the past, contributed to the phenomenal growth and
transformation of the industrial sector in accordance with national
priorities. On the other hand, the system was responsible for excessive
credit expansion and inflation. Directed lending also has encouraged high
debt/equity ratios in the corporate sector and has contributed to excessive
investment in some branches of heavy industry. Doubt has been expressed by
the Korean authorities themselves about the desirability of maintaining the
rigid system of centrally directed lending because of the growing complexity
of the economy. The need for fine tuning of investment decisions cannot be
flexibly accommodated under the present system. It is recognized that
directed and concessional lending should not be discontinued but should be
reduced in scope and size to clearly defined priority sectors and branches of
industry. At the same time, some liberalization of the operations of the
financial sector, particularly of commercial banks, seems desirable and
timely.
Reform of Financial System
2.27      Bank surveys of the Korean financial system have led to a number of
specific recommendations aimed at improving the efficiency of the financial
sector. The main recommendations are summarized below:
(a) interest rates on time/savings deposits and lending rates
should be maintained at a positive level in real terms to
encourage a reliable flow of term resources into the DMBs;
(b) the proportion of directed lending made for specified purposes and
borrowers at government behest should be reduced relative to total
lending;
(c) the share of directed lending which commands concessional interest
rates, primarily export credits and NIF, should be reduced in scope
and volume and the extent of the interest subsidy ought to be reas-
sessed;
(d) as directed concessional lending is reduced, institutional
arrangements for delivery of funds, particularly NIF, ought to be
rationalized. Concentration of NIF lending in the specialized banks



- 17 -
and KDB is recommended since these institutions have the necessary
expertise in term lending.  Commercial banks would be freed to meet
other credit needs including export financing;
(e) more operational discretion in management and operational decisions
should be given to the commercial banks to increase efficiency and
competition;
(f) harmonization of foreign currency lending rates and interest
spreads ought to be improved;
(g) monetary and credit control instruments available to the BOK
ought to be broadened and made more flexible; and
(h) the bill market, securities market and housing finance ought to be
further developed and encouraged through a comprehensive set of
incentives.
2.28      The Government is aware of the shortcomings and inefficiencies of
the Korean financial system. A policy dialogue between the Bank and the
Government on these matters has been initiated and will be pursued. Interest
rates have already been raised in January 1980 with the intention of
maintaining real rates at a positive level. A move towards liberalization of
the sector has also been announced which, over time, would provide greater
autonomy to financial institutions. As a first step in this direction, the
Long-Term Credit Bank Law was enacted in November 1979. The purpose of this
legislation is to encourage the establishment of a new type of financial
intermediaries operating outside the Government's system of directed lending.
Long-term credit banks would be privately-owned institutions raising a major
part of their resources from the domestic capital market and focusing on
long-term lending for industry. In June 1980, KDFC changed its legal status
and became Korea's first long-term credit bank.
Lending Rates and Inflation
2.29      The continuing high rate of inflation has been a serious problem in
Korea for the past two decades. High inflation has led to a worsening of
Korea's terms of trade and to a loss of real income in relation to real
production. Despite recessionary tendencies in 1979, wholesale and consumer
prices rose by over 18% during the year compared to 12-14% during 1978.
Following the January devaluation of the Won and the dramatic increase in
domestic energy prices, inflation worsened in early 1980. In the first
quarter of the year, the consumer price index increased by 12.1% and the
wholesale price index by 22.2%. Annual increases in the consumer price index
have been projected at 25.4% and 14.8%, respectively, for 1980 and 1981;
actual increases may be higher.



- 18 -
2.30      Domestic Currency Lending Rates.  The January 1980 upward revision
of the interest rate structure (Annex A, Table 8) brought nonconcessional
lending rates for prime borrowers to 24.5% p.a. for working capital and 26.5%
for equipment loans with maturities exceeding eight years./l While the
adjustment of domestic currency interest rates to a positive level in real
terms is a step in the right direction, additional adjustments seem justified
with respect to foreign currency lending rates.
2.31      Foreign Commercial Borrowings.  Until June 1980, the lending rate
for foreign currency loans funded with Eurodollar commercial borrowings was
fixed by MOF at LIBOR + 1% to LIBOR + 1.25% depending on maturity. KDFC is
authorized to charge a slightly higher rate of LIBOR + 2%. With six-month
Eurodollar rates currently at about 14% p.a. (down from 20% in April 1980) a
spread of 1.25% over LIBOR was equivalent to a 15.25% p.a. charge on a
dollar-denominated loan. Over the ten-year period 1971-80, the average annual
depreciation of the Won vis-a-vis the US dollar was about 6% p.a. In Won
terms, a Eurodollar borrowing therefore carried an interest rate of about
21.25% p.a. for the final borrower, compared to the normal rate of 26.5% p.a.
on Won borrowings. Admittedly, the same computation in April showed a cost of
about 27.25% p.a.; it seems, however, that on average, over a period of
several years, access to foreign commercial funds did provide an element of
subsidy to the borrower. Given this context, there was little rationale for
keeping the interest spread accruing to the financial intermediaries at about
0.5% /2 which was much lower than the 2% spread allowed on foreign borrowings
from official sources and was insufficient to cover handling costs.  The lower
interest spread on foreign commercial borrowings effectively represented a
disincentive to more mobilization of resources. In June 1980, an interest
spread of about 2% was authorized by the Government as a means of reducing the
subsidy to the final borrower and lessening the reliance of financial
intermediaries on official sources of funds.
2.32      Foreign Official Borrowings.  The effective cost to subborrowers of
foreign resources raised from official agencies such as IBRD and ADB is more
difficult to estimate in Won terms because of the variable currency mix of
disbursements. KDFC has carried out a detailed analysis of the cost of funds
under three of the loans it received from the Bank. Under Loan 1145-KO
the nominal borrowing rate from the Bank was 8.5%. In accordance with the
standard practice imposed by the MOF, funds were onlent with an interest
/1  Working capital loans to nonprime borrowers carry a 25% lending rate and
equipment loans a rate of 25.5% for 3-8 years and 24.5% under 3 years.
/2  Assuming a borrowing cost for the intermediary of LIBOR + 0.75% and an
onlending rate of LIBOR + 1.25%. KDFC has been allowed a margin of 1.25%.

spread of 2% and the foreign exchange risk passed on to the subborrowers. The
nominal onlending rate therefore stood at 10.5% p.a. Disbursements of "hard"
currencies (Yen, Deutsche Mark and Swiss Francs) which appreciated against the
US dollar reached 61% of total disbursements. As a consequence, the effective
rate, in dollar terms, for the subborrowers reached 19.5% p.a./l The average
appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis the Won reached about 7% p.a. over the
loan disbursement period, thus bringing the effective lending rate in Won
terms to 26.5% p.a./2   By comparison, KDFC's standard lending rate for
domestic currency equipment loans stood at 20.5% p.a. until January 1980 and
has since been raised to 26% p.a. Other official loans to KDFC and other
financial intermediaries in Korea, including KDB, had a similar effective
cost and therefore do not appear to impart any sizeable interest subsidy to
the recipients by comparison with Won-denominated loans and with foreign
commercial loans.
2.33      Onlending practices for foreign official borrowings, however, do
create some distortions in final lending rates due to the government policy of
requiring that these loans be onlent with a uniform spread of 2%. With sub-
stantially different lending costs over time and between lending agencies,
subborowers from the same institution, at the same time, ostensibly similar in
essential characteristics, obtain funds on different terms. It was agreed at
negotiations that each financial institution would be allowed to commingle
its official foreign resources and that a spread of 2% be applied to the
weighted average cost of these funds./3 This results in a uniform onlending
rate subject to adjustment as new lines of credit are mobilized from
official sources.
Bank Lending Strategy
2.34      Bank lending to Korean industries is effected primarily through
specialized long-term financial intermediaries. This type of lending was
initiated 12 years ago with a first loan to the Korea Development Finance
Corporation (KDFC). The Bank has now established a solid relationship
with four Korean Development Finance Companies (DFCs) which, in aggregate,
supplied over 50% of the increase in medium and long-term loans extended to
the manufacturing sector in 1977-78. The Bank has helped meet the financial
needs of medium and large-scale firms primarily through KDB and KDFC./4
The financial support of smaller-scale enterprises by the Bank was initiated
in 1975 through a first loan to the Small and Medium Industry Bank (SMIB)
and to the Citizens National Bank (CNB) in 1980.
/1 On average over the period 1976-80.
/2 Similar calculations for earlier loans show an effective lending rate in
Won terms of 18.5% for Loan 705-KO and 17.4% for 905-KO.

/4 Seven Bank loans aggregating $320 million have been made to KDFC and
three loans for a total of $252.5 million to KDB.



- 20 -
2.35      The Strategic Role of KDB and KDFC.  The long association of the
Bank with KDB and KDFC has had a very positive impact in terms of (a)
overall resource transfer to the vitally important industrial sector; (b)
the building up of large and efficient development finance institutions; and
(c) developmental impetus in the financial and industrial sectors.
2.36      KDB and KDFC through the complementary, though distinct nature of
their operations occupy a central position in the financial sector and serve
as the two major conduits of resource flows to the priority manufacturing
sector. Over the period 1974-79, KDB and KDFC jointly supplied 37.5% of all
term loans to the manufacturing sector. Bank financial support of KDB and
KDFC's operations was instrumental in enabling the two institutions to assume
an increasing role in the transfer of resources to the industrial sector.
2.37      The financial and technical support supplied to KDB and KDFC through
the Bank's lending operations in the past few years has also had a substan-
tial impact on their efficiency and quality as financial intermediaries.
KDB and KDFC have gradually developed into the most efficient intermediaries
on the Korean financial scene, and both now rank among the best DFCs with
which the Bank is associated worldwide. This is reflected not only in the
appropriateness of their operational procedures but also in the quality of
their portfolio and in their success at mobilizing foreign currency resources
from commercial sources.
2.38      Finally the Bank's support of KDB and KDFC has had an impact which
extends beyond the two institutions to the industrial and financial sectors.
The developmental role increasingly assumed by the two intermediaries has led
to a more balanced sectoral and geograpic distribution of industries in Korea
and has helped to deepen the structure of the financial sector. Both KDB and
KDFC have sponsored the establishment of several specialized financial
institutions including leasing companies, investment banks, merchant banks and
short-term finance companies as a means of increasing the range of financial
services available in Korea.
2.39      Satisfactory as this performance and impact on the overall economy
might be, an analysis of the operations and efficiency of both KDB and KDFC
shows a number of shortcomings stemming, in part, from the financial
environment in which they operate. The Bank now proposes to use its lending
operations to KDB and KDFC as a vehicle for addressing with the Korean
Government the general financial sector issues which affect the efficiency of
individual institutions.
2.40      The recent Economic Report prepared by the Bank /1 indicates that
inefficiencies have surfaced in the structure and operations of the
industrial sector in Korea and may have contributed to the lackluster
performance of the Korean economy in 1979. Furthermore, the Economic
/1 "Current Developments and Policy Issues," dated May 20, 1980.



- 21 -
Report also recommends that the Government consider undertaking a
comprehensive reform of the financial system. Such a reform would play an
important complementary role in improving the performance of the industrial
sector. The Government has informed the Bank in a series of discussions over
the past few months that it is in general agreement with these policy
recommendations and is committed to undertaking a major reform of the
financial system.
2.41      The inefficiencies identified in the Bank's review of the indus-
trial and financial sectors transcend individual financial institutions.
While past DFC lending has been efficient and has helped reach lending
objectives, the changed circumstances facing the economy and the expanding
demands placed on financial intermediaries suggest that the Bank-s
involvement in financial issues needs to be broadened from the narrow
project focus of the past. The Bank has acquired detailed knowledge of the
workings of the financial system and is in the process of developing, in
collaboration with the Korean authorities, the blueprint of a scheme designed
to make the system more responsive to the needs of a rapidly maturing
industrial sector which operates in an increasingly competitive international
environment.
2.42      Bank lending for industry should now be tailored to accommodate
these broader sectoral objectives. While the format of industrial lending
will retain the past DFC lending approach, these operations will be used as a
springboard for reaching other important objectives beyond resource transfer
and institution-building objectives. Taking advantage of the simultaneous
need to replenish the long-term foreign exchange resources of KDB and KDFC,
the Bank invited the Government to negotiate both loans at the same time
as a vehicle for discussing further the financial sector policy recommen-
dations. A common understanding was reached was reached at negotiations
regarding Korea's longer-term strategy for improving efficiency in the
financial sector. As a first step, a package of specific policy measures and
supplementary studies to be implemented by the Government and KDB over an
appropriate time frame was agreed upon which would provide a linkage between
financial sector issues and the proposed KDB and KDFC operations. The
proposed projects would support the first stage of a comprehensive reform of
the financial sector. At negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government on a "Statement of Korea's Financial Sector Policy Improvements"
expressing the broad objectives of the financial sector reform and outlining
a number of policy measures to be implemented in an agreed time frame. Other
financial sector issues, requiring further study will be discussed with the
Korean Government in the context of forthcoming Structural Adjustment Loans
and future financial sector loans.

3. THE KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION /1
Background
3.01      Bank lending to Korean industries is channeled primarily through
specialized long-term financial intermediaries. This type of lending was
initiated 12 years ago with the first loan to the Korea Development Finance
Corporation (KDFC). The Bank has since established a solid relationship
with four Korean Development Finance Companies (DFCs) which, in aggregate,
supplied over 50% of the increase in medium and long-term loans extended to
the manufacturing sector in 1977-78. The Bank has helped meet the financial
needs of medium and large-scale firms primarily through KDB and KDFC./2
The financial support of smaller-scale enterprises by the Bank was initiated
in 1975 through a first loan to the Small and Medium Industry Bank (SMIB)
and to the Citizens National Bank (CNB) in 1980.
The Role of KDFC
3.02      KDFC was incorporated in 1967 and remains, to date, the only
privately owned development finance company in Korea. KDFC was established
with the active support of the World Bank Group as a joint venture between
domestic and foreign investors including the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) and foreign commercial banks. In June 1980, KDFC
successfully completed its transformation into a multipurpose financial
institution by changing its legal status and quintupling its share capital.
KDFC became the Korea Long-Term Credit Bank (KLTCB), the first institution
to be established under the recently enacted Long-Term Credit Bank Law
(December 1979).
3.03      KDFC is a much smaller institution than KDB.  At the end of 1979,
it had a total staff of 163 and total assets of W 209 billion ($431 million)
which represented less than 0.5% of the total assets of the financial
sector. KDFC has only one branch office, in Busan. At end-1979, its
outstanding loan portfolio of W 184.5 billion was equivalent to about 8.6%
of KDB-s portfolio. KDFC's status as a private institution has precluded
its participation in the Government's directed and subsidized lending
programs./3 Nevertheless, a review of KDFC's operations shows that its
lending has been focused on financing priority sectors within manufacturing.
The manufacturing sector accounted for 67% of KDFC's outstanding loan
portfolio at end-1979.
/1 KDFC became the Korea Long-Term Credit Bank (KLTCB) on June 2, 1980.
In this report, the institution is referred to alternatively as KDFC
and KLTCB depending on the context.
/2 Seven Bank loans aggregating $320 million have been made to KDFC and
three loans for a total of $252.5 million to KDB.
/3 A description of these programs is given in paras. 2.19 through 2.22.



- 23 -
3.04      The range of financial services which KDFC was authorized to
provide included (a) medium- and long-term loans in foreign and domestic
currencies; (b) equity investments through underwriting and direct partici-
pation; (c) payment guarantees for procurement of machinery and equipment;
(d) guarantees and underwriting of corporate securities; and (e) technical
and managerial consulting services. Notwithstanding this wide range of
services open to KDFC, resource constraints have in practice compelled this
institution to operate primarily as a relender of long-term foreign currency
resources. As of December 31, 1979, 96.3% of KDFC's outstanding loan port-
folio was in foreign exchange. Because of a shortage of domestic currency
resources, KDFC does not finance the short-term working capital requirements
of industry and its long-term domestic currency lending operations are
limited. KDFC's share of the increase in term loans, domestic and foreign,
to manufacturing reached 5.8% over the period 1977-79, significantly higher
than its 2% share of total loans (short- and long-term). Over the period
1973-76, KDFC's foreign currency lending was nearly as large as KDB's./1
Starting in 1977, however, the growth in KDB's foreign currency lending has
outpaced KDFC's. In 1979, KDFC-s foreign currency commitments reached
$125.3 million compared to $423.5 million for KDB.
3.05      While KDB's operations encompass both the private and public
sectors, KDFC-s charter restricts its activities to the private sector.
KDFC provides financing to relatively large enterprises; its clients,
however, are at the lower end of the "large industry" spectrum and tend to be
firms which are not actively backed by the Government's system of directed
lending. Since the major institutional sources of term lending have been
subject to government direction, KDFC has served as a source of funds for
private entrepreneurs who have chosen or been obliged to operate outside
the system of directed credits.
3.06      Unlike KDB, KDFC was not precluded from lending to small
enterprises /2 and has done so directly and through cofinancing arrangements
with some of the regional commercial banks (RCB). About 20% of KDFC's total
loan approvals over 1975-79 were for small industry projects.
Impact of Bank Lending to KDFC
3.07      KDFC's association with the Bank Group dates back to over 12 years.
In that period, KDFC has developed into a highly successful financial
institution and one of the best DFCs with which the Bank is associated
worldwide. KDFC-s total assets have increased from W 3.9 billion at
/1  KDFC's cumulative commitments reached $160.7 million in the four-year
period as against $185.4 million for KDB.
/2  i.e., enterprises employing less than 300 persons or having assets of
less than W 500 million.



- 24 -
end-1968 to W 209.2 billion at end-1979 representing an average growth rate
of 43.5% p.a. Loan approvals have similarly increased from W 1.3 billion in
1968 to W 63.7 billion in 1979, an average growth of 42.5% p.a. The
financial and technical support supplied to KDFC through previous Bank loans
has had a substantial impact on the allocation of resources to the industrial
sector, on KDFC-s efficiency and quality as a financial intermediary and has
also had a broader impact on the industrial and financial sectors through
the important developmental activities carried out by KDFC. A detailed
analysis of KDFC's operations, institutional strengths and organization, and
financial performance is given in Annex B. The following paragraphs provide
a summary review of these aspects.
Resource Allocation
3.08      KDFC raises its resources independently from the Government /1 and
has not been required to participate in the administration of the government
sponsored special funding programs. Although KDFC does exercise full
discretion in its lending decisions its resource allocation has responded
very closely to government priorities. KDFC's operational priorities and
lending objectives are outlined in a Policy Statement adopted in 1967.
Short-term objectives are outlined in successive Development Strategy
Statements formulated in consultation with the Bank and revised and updated
every two years. In the period 1968-79, the manufacturing sector accounted
for 65.2% of KDFC-s aggregate loan approvals and in response to the
Government's emphasis on deepening the industrial structure, the share of
heavy and chemical industries in KDFC's total lending for manufacturing has
increased from 53% over the period 1968-74 to 76% over 1975-79. KDFC has
also been active in promoting small-scale industry through innovative
financing mechanisms with regional banks.
3.09      Over the past few yars, KDFC has effectively contributed to the
development of the industrial sector by allocating resources to projects
which have proved financially and economically sound. From its establish-
ment in 1967 through the end of 1979, KDFC had approved financial assistance
to 513 projects with total project cost of W 682 billion ($1.4 billion) of
which KDFC financed about 36%. In 1979, KDFC approved 96 projects requiring
loans aggregating W 63.7 billion ($131 million). At end-1979, KDFC's
outstanding portfolio amounted to W 185.3 billion and comprised 273 client
companies.
3.10      KDFC-s internal procedures governing project appraisal and super-
vision as well as procurement and disbursement have been kept under constant
review and have improved regularly to their very satisfactory current level.
/1 With the qualification that foreign borrowings from official sources do
require a government guarantee, and with the exception of a subordinated
government loan obtained at KDFCGs inception (para. 3.18).



- 25 -
Procurement procedures are detailed in para. 2.13 of Annex B. The average
size of KDFC-s subloans under the latest Bank loan (1635-KO) was relatively
small at $1.2 million. Moreover, close to 84% of the loan amount was allo-
cated to expansion projects. As a consequence, few projects qualified for
international competitive bidding. Limited competitive bidding accounted
for 44% of all procurement contracts. KDFC-s procurement procedures are
satisfactory to the Bank. All procurement contracts are subject to KDFC's
prior review and approval. The quality of KDFC-s appraisal of investment
proposals is such that its appraisal reports have been used as training
material by other financial institutions both within and outside Korea.
This high quality is also reflected in KDFC-s very sound loan portfolio. At
end-1979, one single loan accounting for 0.2% of KDFC-s outstanding loan
portfolio had been in arrears for more than three months. Total arrears of
principal and interest represented 0.04% of the loan portfolio. In 1979,
KDFC rescheduled three loans representing 0.8% of the end-of-year loan
portfolio. By any standard, KDFC-s loan portfolio is of excellent quality.
Financial rates of return ranged from 16.4% to 37.7% for subprojects
financed out of the latest Bank loan to KDFC, economic rates of return
ranged from 11% to 48.6%.
Institutional Capability
3.11      KDFC-s success in evolving into an important source of long-term
financing in Korea is due primarily to the exceptional quality of its man-
agement and organization. KDFC's management has been able to combine a
rapid growth of operations with sound financial administration. Thoughtful
advance planning has led to successive and timely changes in KDFC-s organi-
zational setup, and to its recent transformation into a long-term credit
bank.
3.12      KDFC-s operational efficiency is reflected in the low level of
its administrative expenses which have declined steadily from 1.3% of aver-
age assets in 1975 to 0.9% in 1979. Earnings as a percentage of total
assets have declined from 2.3% in 1975 to 1.8% in 1979 owing to a rapid
increase in interest expenses. A higher gearing ratio (9.1:1 in 1979) has,
however, maintained the return on equity at a satisfactory level (18.8% in
1979) and has enabled KDFC to distribute cash dividends of 20% of par in
1976-78 and 23% in 1979. Despite this relatively high level of dividend
payments, retained earnings have been substantial. The need to maintain a
satisfactory level of profitability and dividends was essential for a
privately owned institution like KDFC. KDFC-s policy of distributing
satisfactory cash dividends was instrumental in enabling the quintupling of
its share capital in June 1980 in order to qualify as a long-term credit
bank. The concern of KDFC's management to maintain profitability at a
satisfactory level has not been detrimental to the institution's
developmental activities.



- 26 -
Developmental Impact on the Financial Sector
3.13      A detailed review of KDFC's promotional activities is shown in
Annex B. Aside from the technical and managerial assistance normally
provided by development finance institutions, KDFC has been particularly
active in conducting in-depth studies of selected industrial subsectors.
More importantly, KDFC has contributed to the development of the Korean
financial system by promoting the establishment of several specialized
financial institutions.
3.14      In 1972, KDFC and IFC jointly sponsored the first short-term
finance company to be established in Korea.  Subsequently, 15 other
short-term finance companies were established as an alternative to the
high-cost short-term money available from the unorganized money market. In
1974, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) established with
KDFC a joint venture company for promoting the commercial exploitation of
patents and technical processes developed by KIST. Finally, KDFC was the
promoter and is the largest shareholder of a leasing company sponsored
jointly with IFC and Orient Leasing of Japan in 1975. KDFC also has entered
into cofinancing arrangements with four of the ten regional commercial banks
with the aim of broadening the geographic dispersal of its operations and of
increasing its financial assistance to small-scale industries. Training
courses in project appraisal have been organized by KDFC for the staff of
the regional banks which helped improve skills in the commercial banking
sector.
3.15      Through the promotion of specialized financial institutions, KDFC
has helped broaden the range of financial services available in Korea and
has contributed to deepening the structure of the financial system. KDFC's
main achievement in developing the financial sector, however, lies in its
own conversion into a multipurpose financial institution in mid-1980. This
conversion, more than a change of name, represents a considerable boradening
of the institution's scope of activities and a quantum jump in the size
of its future operations. This transformation aimed specifically at removing
the constraints KDFC had faced until then in its resource mobilization
efforts.
Resource Mobilization by KDFC
3.16      The financial resources available to KDFC for supporting its oper-
ations comprise borrowings and equity resources. KDFC's equity resources
are, however, limited (W 19.8 billion at end-1979) and approximately 50% have
been used to finance KDFC's investment portfolio and fixed assets. The
following table shows that a direct relationship exists between KDFC's
lending performance and its ability to mobilize resources (in Won billion).

The amount of domestic currency loans outstanding exceeding its borrowings
has been financed by KDFC from its equity resources.
3.17      Foreign Currency Resource Mobilization.  Since foreign currency
lending accounts for 96-97% of KDFC-s portfolio, mobilization of foreign re-
sources is critical. KDFC-s performance has been quite satisfactory in this
respect and foreign currency borrowings outstanding have grown at about 36%
p.a. over the past three years. Until 1975, KDFC relied entirely on
official sources of funds (ADB, IBRD, et al) for its foreign currency
resources. IFC was instrumental in introducing KDFC to foreign commercial
lenders through a $17.8 million loan syndicated in 1976. In the following
years, KDFC raised on its own $20 million from Citibank in 1977, $30 million
from Deutsche Bank in 1978 and $50 million from Industrial Bank of Japan in
1979. Commercial borrowings of about $100 million are expected in 1980 but
their availability is uncertain at the moment. The following table
summarizes KDFC's mobilization performance on a commitment basis over the
period 1976-79 (in $ million):

Over the four-year period under review, KDFC's aggregate reliance on official
borrowings has declined to 69%. It took KDFC a relatively short period of
nine years after its establishment in 1967 to start mobilizing foreign
commercial borrowings but its name is now sufficiently well established on
the market to support increased mobilization efforts from that source. Over
the period 1980-82, KDFC expects to reduce further its reliance on official
resources to about 50%.
3.18      Domestic Currency Resource Mobilization.  KDFC has been much less
successful in mobilizing domestic currency resources. Through end-1979,
KDFC had mobilized aggregate domestic resources of W 23.4 billion; 42.6%
came from its share capital, 33.2% from reserves, and the balance from a
government-subordinated loan obtained in 1967 and other provisions.
3.19      KDFC has not been able to mobilize larger amounts of domestic
currency resources because, by law, it was not permitted to accept deposits
nor to issue debentures for onlending purposes./l To remove this constraint
and expand the scope of its operations, KDFC was converted into a Long-Term
Credit Bank (LTCB) on June 2, 1980.
3.20      The preceding review of KDFC's performance in the twelve year
period 1968-79 shows that KDFC has accumulated an impressive record of
operational growth while steadily developing its institutional strengths and
playing a substantial development role. Despite this very satisfactory
record, KDFC accounted for only 0.5% of the total assets of the Korean
financial sector at end-1979 and its loan disbursements over the period
1971-78 represented no more than 2.1% of current price fixed investment in
the manufacturing sector. KDFC has achieved a rapid growth in its loan
portfolio at an average rate of 41% p.a. over 1976-79 but its share in total
equipment financing by Korean financial institutions has remained stagnant
/1 KDFC, unlike other financial institutions was established as a corpora-
tion under the commercial code.



- 29 -
at about 4-5%. The reason for this relative stagnation lies in KDFC-s
virtual absence from the market of long-term domestic currency financing.
KDFC's domestic currency loan portfolio has been growing at a rate of only
19% p.a. over 1976-79 and accounted for less than 4% of the total loan
portfolio at end-1979. The constraint was inherent in KDFC's legal status
as a corporation rather than a banking institution which prevented the
issuance of debentures or other instruments of indebtedness for onlending
purposes.
Conversion into a Long-Term Credit Bank
3.21       KDFC's management had the foresight to visualize since the mid-
1970s the need for the institution to reassess its long-term strategy and
role in the financial sytem. Management concerns stemmed from the
increasingly complex economic environment in which KDFC operated, the
growing maturity of the industrial sector and a more competitive foreign
currency relending market in Korea (which had been KDFC's main business
activity). Korea's declining reliance on foreign savings restricted the
future of an institution geared primarily towards the relending of borrowed
foreign exchange resources. Simultaneously, the structural deepening of the
industrial sector and the growth of a domestic machinery industry
increasingly capable of satisfying the equipment needs of Korean industries
made the supply of domestic currency financing critical for the growth
prospects of long-term credit institutions.
3.22       In 1977, KDFC initiated an internal study of alternative strategies
aimed at better tailoring its financial services to the requirements of the
industrial sector. The Bank and IFC assisted KDFC in this study which was
finalized in mid-1978. The study concluded that KDFC needed to change its
legal status as a prerequisite to diversifying and expanding its operations.
3.23       KDFC acknowledged the fact that the composition of its resources
was "unbalanced" because of difficulties in mobilizing domestic currency
resources. At the same time, KDFC was concerned by a likely decline in the
relative and absolute size of resources available from foreign official
sources in view of Korea's economic success and increasing
per capita income. This concern was fully justified as is evidenced by the
fact that the proposed loan to KDFC/KLTCB amounts to $90 million compared to
the previous loan of $100 million. Increased reliance on foreign commercial
sources was also getting more difficult because of strict govermnent controls
on overseas borrowings and the increasing ability of some KDFC clients to
borrow from commercial sources directly on terms comparable to those
available to KDFC itself. More importantly, KDFC expected to see the overall
demand for foreign exchange loans decline gradually and demand for domestic
currency increase proportionately. KDFC had no alternative but to increase
its domestic currency financing which could only be achieved through a change
in its legal status.



- 30 -
3.24      There appeared to be good business prospects for a privately-
owned financial institution undertaking long-term domestic currency finan-
cing. The long-term domestic currency resources required by a manufacturing
sector increasingly geared toward heavy industry could (and still can) only
be obtained from KDB and other institutions administering the special
lending programs funded by the Government (such as NIF)./1 However, the
cost of the present government-directed financing system for industrial
investment is, however, becoming increasingly onerous for government
finances. Its cost is high not only because of the interest rate subsidies
but also because of the increasing share of government funded programs in
total industrial lending. The Government has already indicated that it
wishes to restrict this type of financing to high priority projects
genuinely requiring subsidized funds with long maturities. This projected
reduction in the scope of government-funded programs in the face of a rising
demand for long-term domestic currency financing provides the rationale for
the creation of new types of financial institutions able to raise their
resources from the domestic capital market rather than from Government.
KDFC could become such an institution. Establishment of this new type of
financial institutions would be in line with government objectives of
increasing savings mobilization from the private sector in replacement of
government and foreign savings.
3.25      The magnitude of the domestic resource mobilization effort required
of KDFC obviously could not be entirely covered, as in the past, by share
capital increases and retained earnings.  There were two possible options
for resource mobilization, namely the issuance of domestic currency debentures
and acceptance of deposits. Both options were, however, closed to KDFC owing
to its legal status as a corporation. This status therefore had to be
changed.
3.26      KDFC concluded in 1978 that two main alternatives were available,
both involving a fundamental change in its legal and organizational set-up.
First, it could be converted into a merchant banking corporation to operate
under the Merchant Banking Act of 1976. The main focus of Korean merchant
banks, however, is on foreign exchange financing through direct borrowings
abroad and, indirectly, as intermediates between domestic borrowers and
foreign lenders. Four merchant banks currently operate in Korea; none has
yet been able to issue domestic currency debentures because of the tax regime
/1 See para. 2.22.



- 31 -
applicable to debentures issued by merchant banks and because of a minimum
maturity of two and half years stipulated in the law. The second alternative
was for KDFC to convert itself into a private long-term credit bank similar
to the private long-term credit banks operating in Japan. While the second
alternative appeared to be more desirable in the long-run, KDFC was concerned
by the absence of the necessary legal basis in Korea and the difficulty of
reorganizing a relatively small institution into a much larger multipurpose
bank within a short period of time.
3.27      Apprised of the KDFC study proposing a diversification and
expansion of operations, the Government reacted very favorably. The Govern-
ment felt that quick action was required to provide the necessary legal basis
for establishment of long-term credit banks patterned after the Industrial
Bank of Japan. This approach was justified by the similarities between the
highly segregated and specialized structure common to both the Korean
financial system and the Japanese financial system. The Government's
intention to liberalize the operations of financial institutions and to give
a more important role to privately-owned financial institutions was consonant
with the promotion of private long-term credit banks.
3.28      The Government moved quickly to draft the necessary legislation in
consultation with KDFC and took steps to encourage a rapid conversion of
KDFC into Korea's first long-term credit bank. The main difficulty for KDFC
was in increasing its paid-in share capital from W 10 billion to W 50 billion,
the minimum required capital for a long-term credit bank. The Long-Term
Credit Bank Law was enacted in December 1979. In May 1980, KDFC's paid-in
share capital was increased to W 50 billion. On June 2, 1980, the Korea
Long-Term Credit Bank opened for business. In July 1980, KLTCB successfully
completed its first issuance-of W 10 billion in domestic currency debentures.
KDFC's success in quintupling its share capital by raising the necessary
resources from the private sector is yet another indication of its efficiency
and of the confidence it enjoys from its shareholders.
3.29       In February 1980, a 50% stock dividend increased KDFC-s paid-in
share capital to W 15 billion. The remaining W 35 billion was raised from
existing and new shareholders. The new shares were issued at par although
their market price was substantially lower following the distribution of a
50% stock dividend. IFC's support through a $2.29 million subscription to
KDFC's capital increase /1 was decisive in securing the subscription of the
other foreign shareholders, who currently hold 21.58% of KLTCB's share
capital. Unsubscribed shares totalling W 21.6 billion were placed by KDFC on
a private basis with business/industrial groups in Korea.
/1 IFC currently holds 5% of the share capital of KLTCB.



- 32 -
KLTCB's Prospects
3.30      Organization and Staffing.  In order to accommodate the diversifi-
cation and expansion of operations resulting from its transformation into
an LTCB, KDFC underwent a reorganization in April 1980 with the creation
of three new departments. The new departments are respectively in charge of:
(a) domestic and foreign exchange business; (b) underwriting and sale of
securities; and (c) acceptance of deposits and short-term financing.
Recruitment and training of staff was initiated in late 1979. By end-1980,
KLTCB expects its total staff strength to reach 245 persons.  In the
three-year period 1980-83, KLTCB-s staff would double.
3.31      Developnent Strategy.  KLTCB's development strategy for 1980-81
aims at identifying and developing projects which: (a) expand employment
opportunites; (b) enhance production efficiency; and (c) consume less energy.
Continued support will be given to smaller industries with about 20% of total
lending directed to small- and medium-scale enterprises. Operational guide-
lines and procedures are being developed to regulate KLTCB's new activities.
Projected Operations
3.32      Domestic Currency Lending.  KDFC's main objective in obtaining
from MOF a license to operate as an LTCB was to allow the issuance of
long-term debentures in domestic currency. Acceptance of deposits from
corporate borrowers is also authorized but Article 2 of the LTCB Law states
that issuance of debentures should be preferred as a source of finance for
term lending. The increase in KDFC's share capital has brought in
sufficient resources to cover most of KLTCB's domestic currency requirements
in 1980-81. KLTCB, however, planned to start issuing domestic currency
debentures of W 10 billion in 1980. Issuances in 1981 and 1982
were projected at W 30 billion and W 50 billion respectively. MOF has ruled
that, as with KDB Bonds, interest on the KLTCB debentures would be tax
exempt./l KLTCB plans to issue discount debentures with maturities of one
to three years /2 and coupon debentures with maturities of two to five
years./3  Nominal and effective yields would be marginally higher than KDB
bonds to compensate for the government guarantee available on KDB issues. On
current assumptions, the average funding cost to KLTCB would be 31.1% p.a.
including issuing expenses.
/1 This feature is particularly attractive for corporate buyers who would
otherwise be liable to the full corporate income tax. The tax payable
by individual bond purchasers is only 5%.
/2 With effective yields of 28.5% to 29.3%.
/3  With effective yields of 29.3% to 31.1%.



- 33 -
3.33      KLTCB is allowed by MOF to charge nominal interest rates on its
domestic currency loans at about two percentage points above KDB's rates for
nonpriority borrowers, i.e., 28% to 28.5% p.a. With interest payments at
front, the effective yield /1 to KLTCB would be 33.7% to 34.4%. Given a cost
of debentures of 31.1%, the interest spread accruing to KLTCB could reach
2.5% to 3.2%. KLTCB's assumptions appear to be reasonable. Successful
issuance of domestic currency debentures would allow a sizeable expansion of
KLTCB's operations and would contribute to the development of the Korean
bond market. KLTCB expects its domestic currency lending to reach the
equivalent of $55 million and $75 million on an approval basis in 1980 and
1981, respectively. By 1982, domestic currency lending would represent 43%
of total lending operations compared to 5.4% in 1979. Domestic currency
lending is forecast to increase dramatically from W 3.2 billion in 1979 to
W 152 billion in 1984, representing an average growth rate of 116% p.a.
3.34      Foreign Currency Lending.  Foreign currency loan approvals are
projected to grow at an average of about 10% p.a. over 1980-84 compared to a
historical growth rate of 31% p.a. over 1976-79. The conservativeness of the
foreign currency business projections is based on KLTCB's expectation of a
slowdown in demand for foreign currency funds. Moreover, KLTCB will focus on
developing its domestic currency lending operations. A higher level of
foreign currency lending might be achieved if foreign borrowings were to
exceed projections. This is doubtful considering that KLTCB's borrowing
program is already quite ambitious. KLTCB expects to mobilize a total of
$840 million over 1980-84 of which $370 million (including the proposed $90
million loan) would come from official sources and the balance of $470
million would be mobilized from commercial sources. The ratio of commercial
to official borrowings was 35:65 in 1978-79; the projected ratio for 1980-82
is 48:52 and 66:34 in 1983-84. KDFC had uncommited foreign currency
resources of $81.5 million at end-1979 which was not enough to cover
projected commitments of $136 million in 1980. Assuming that the proposed
Bank loan becomes effective in early 1981, it would cover approximately 28%
of KLTCB's projected foreign currency commitments ($325 million) in 1981-82.
Financial Forecasts
3.35      KLTCB's total gross income is expected to double in 1980 as a
result of the January 1980 increase in domestic currency lending rates and
of the increased income derived from foreign currency loans following the
20% devaluation of the Won. KLTCB's net return to total assets is expected
to increase from 1.8% in 1979 to 2.1% in 1984. The debt/equity ratio which
temporarily exceeded the contractual limit of 10:1 in the first quarter of
1980 had declined to - at the end of June 1980, following the increase in
KDFC's paid-in share capital. A ratio of 4.8:1 is expected at end-1980 with
a slow increase over 1981-84 to 7.9:1 by end-1984.
/1 KLTCB actually plans to supply its domestic currency financing by
purchasing corporate debentures issued in the name of its borrowers.

4. THE PROPOSED BANK LOAN
Objectives and Justification
4.01      KDFC's establishment as a private development finance institution
in 1967 was made possible by the strong support of the Government and the
active assistance of the Bank Group which contributed to the initial
capitalization of KDFC through a first IBRD loan of $5 million and an equity
participation by IFC. In June 1980, KDFC successfully completed its trans-
formation into Korea's first Long-Term Credit Bank. This transformation into
a financial intermediary of a new type was in keeping with the pioneering
role which KDFC has played in the Korean financial sector over the past 12
years. Once again, KDFC-s transformation into KLTCB was made possible by the
strong support of the Korean Government. Once again, IFC has played a
crucial role in ensuring the participation of foreign shareholders in the
quintupling of KDFC-s share capital. And once again, the Bank is called upon
to support this quantum jump through a new lending operation.
4.02      Although KDFC has received seven Bank loans totalling $320 million
since its establishment, the proposed $90 million loan would not be merely
a repeat operation. The qualitative and quantitative transformation of
KDFC-s operations which is expected to take place in the next few years
and which the proposed loan would support, is expected to have a broader
impact on the financial sector as a whole. The Government views KLTCB as the
prototype of Korea-s future private financial institutions. The
establishment of KLTCB is expected to "help stimulate the modernization of
the Korean financial system."
4.03      The impact which the Government expects on the financial sector as
a whole from the reorientation of KDFC-s operations provides the rationale
for the simultaneous negotiation of the proposed loan to KLTCB with the
other Bank loan to KDB against the backdrop of a broader sectoral context.
The financial sector reform which was discussed at negotiations aims
primarily at relaxing some of the government controls on the operations of
financial intermediaries. The establishment of KLTGB is in line with this
government concern to liberalize the financial system in Korea. The sectoral
objectives of the KDB and KLTCB loans are therefore largely complementary.
The KDB project would support a reorganization of the government system of
directed lending while, on the other hand, the KLTCB project would strengthen
the capability of a financial institution of a new type operating outside the
public sector. This dual approach is expected to result in an increased
flow of long-term resources for industry and in greater efficiency in fund
allocation.
4.04      As with the proposed loan to KDB, an additional objective of the
project would be to help reduce the high indebtedness of Korean industries.
KLTCB would be required to make its financial assistance conditional upon



- 35 -
adequate equity contributions by project sponsors and to assist in
strengthening the financial structure of its borrowers. To this end, as
agreed at negotiations, access to Bank funds would be limited to those
enterprises which are committed to improving their financial structure and
which have a debt/equity ratio (including the proposed subloan) not in excess
of 5:1.
4.05      KDFC's past performance in utilizing previous Bank loans has been
highly satisfactory from both the institutional and developmental viewpoints.
KDFC has been a remarkably efficient intermediary for allocating funds,
including Bank resources, to Korea's key industrial sector. Through KDFC as
an intermediary, Bank resources totalling $314.2 million on a commitment
basis had been allocated, as of end-July 1980, to 350 economically and finan-
cially viable projects in the manufacturing, agro-industry, transportation
and construction sectors.
4.06      The proposed Bank loan of $90 million would finance about 27% of
KDFC's estimated foreign currency commitments over the two-year period
1981-82. In the past, KDFC's financing accounted for an average of 35% of the
cost of the projects it assisted;/l on that basis, the proposed loan would
support projects having an aggregate investment cost of about $260 million.
The subprojects financed by KDFC in the past have been heavily export-
oriented /2 and have yielded substantial economic benefits; financial rates
of return for a representative sample of KDFC-financed subprojects ranged
from 16% to 37.7% and ERR from 11% to 65.4%. The subprojects to be financed
by KLTCB under the proposed Bank loan are expected to yield similar economic
benefits. Based on the average cost per job of the projects recently
financed by KDFC, the proposed loan would help create approximately 5,000
jobs.
Main Features of the Loan
4.07      Purpose.  As with previous Bank loans to KDFC, the proposed loan
would be used to finance: (a) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of directly
imported goods and services and (b) 60% of the cost in domestic currency
(representing the estimated foreign exchange component) of locally manu-
factured or procured machinery and equipment. The procurement procedures
of KDFC have been designed to ensure a satisfactory degree of competition and
reasonable costs. Procurement procedures remained unchanged following the
conversion into an LTCB. While the Bank is satisfied with the performance of
KDFC in dealing with procurement matters under previous Bank loans, KLTCB has
agreed to modify its Policy Statement by including a statement that it is
KLTCB's intention to apply International Competitive Bidding procedures when-
ever the size and nature of procurement justify them.
/1 KLTCB's ability to satisfy the domestic currency needs of its sub-
borrowers should result in a higher ratio in the future.
/2 About 33% of KDFC's cumulative loan approvals over 1975-79 were for
projects exporting more than 50% of their output.



- 36 -
4.08      Amortization Schedule.  As is usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the
proposed loan would have an adjustable composite amortization schedule
reflecting the aggregate amortization schedules of the subloans made by
KLTCB. The proposed loan is expected to be fully repaid within 15 years
including a grace period of three years. The individual subloans would have
a maximum maturity of 13 years including a normal grace period of three
years. To encourage the use of Bank funds as a catalyst for increased
mobilization of medium-term foreign commercial borrowings by KLTCB, the Bank
would extend to 5 years the grace period of subloans funded with a mix of
commercial and Bank funds (para. 4.10). A disbursement schedule for the
proposed loan is provided in Annex B, Table 35.
4.09      In the past, KDFC has attempted to harmonize the lending terms and
conditions of its foreign currency financing by providing some individual
borrowers with both commercial and official resources for a given subproj-
ect. In practice, the subborrower was receiving two subloans, one funded
with commercial and the other with official resources. This mixing of
floating rate funds (from commercial sources) with fixed rate funds (from
official sources) was used by KDFC primarily to reduce the magnitude to
fluctuations in interest costs to the subborrowers. No attempt had been
made by KDFC to blend both types of resources to cover the shorter maturi-
ties of a specific subloan with foreign commercial resources and the later
maturities with official resources because the grace period allowed on
official borrowings was too short. The advantage of blending resources is
that foreign official borrowings which carry a maturity of up to 13 years
can be spread over a larger number of projects. The advantage to KDFC is
that it could mobilize and make use of foreign commercial resources having a
relatively short maturity (4 to 5 years) instead of following the current
practice of matching the maturity of borrowings with the maturity of the
subloan./l
4.10      Under the proposed loan, the Bank would agree to fit the amorti-
zation of its funds around shorter-term commercial borrowings for sub-
projects co-funded with commercial and Bank resources. This feature would
allow the use of shorter-term (4-5 years) commercial resources in the
financing of long-term loans thereby increasing the availability of
long-term resources the economy. The increase in the flow of commercial
funds would help reduce the share of official resources in KLTCB's total
foreign borrowings.
4.11      KDFC has been authorized by the Government to charge an interest
spread of 1.25% over the cost of its foreign commercial borrowings compared
to a 2% spread authorized on official borrowings. Apart from being barely
sufficient to cover handling costs, the lower spread effectively discrimi-
nates against the mobilization of commercial resources. This matter was
discussed with government representatives at negotiations and it was agreed
that the Government would take all necessary action to allow KLTCB to charge
an interest spread of up to 2% over the cost of its foreign commercial
borrowings.
/1 KDFCGs subloans had an average maturity of 9.5 years in 1979.



- 37 -
4.12      Free Limit.  Under the previous Bank loan to KDFC the free limit for
subloans was set at $4.0 million. The standards of KDFC's operations
would justify a complete waiver of the free limit. Both KLTCB and the Bank,
however, believe in the desirability of the Bank continuing to review for
prior approval a limited number of subprojects so as to maintain a dialogue
on subproject appraisal.  It is therefore recommended that the free limit be
increased to $5 million. It is expected that this would result in the Bank
reviewing subprojects representing approximately 30% of the total loan
amount.
4.13      Subloan Ceiling.  No subloan ceiling had been set by the Bank under
the previous loan to KDFC. The limitation to 25% of its equity incorporated
in KDFC's Policy Statement was adequate to ensure that the proceeds of the
loan were spread over a relatively large number of projects. Following the
conversion of KDFC into KLTCB and the five-fold increase in the paid in
capital, total equity is expected to reach about $107 million by end-1980. A
subloan ceiling of over $25 million would be excessive. It is therefore
recommended that a ceiling of $10 million be imposed on individual subloans.
4.14      Debt/Equity Limit.  Under previous loan agreements, the limit on
KDFC's long-term debt was set at 10 times its equity. This limit is
considered adequate and no change is therefore proposed.
4.15      Relending Rate.  As indicated in para. 2.34, the current practice
of imposing a uniform spread of 2% on the cost of foreign official borrowings
results in arbitary discrepancies in KLTCB's final lending rates. As agreed
upon during negotiations, the relending rate under the proposed loan would be
based on the weighted average cost of the foreign currency resources
available to KLTCB for future lending. A 2% interest spread would be added
to the average cost for determining the final lending rate to subborrowers.
This is likely to result in a nominal relending rate of 11% p.a. with the
foreign exchange risk passed on to subborrowers. Under previous Bank loans
to KDFC, the Bank's practice of disbursing a mix of US dollars and other
currencies brought up the effective cost of Bank funds for the subborrowers
reached 17.4-26.5% p.a. in Won terms compared to nominal lending rates of
9.25% and 10.50%,/1 (para. 2.33). Assuming that past trends in foreign
exchange fluctuations remain unchanged, the effective lending rate in Won
terms of the proposed loan would be about 23% p.a. The effective cost of
Bank funds would be in line with that of foreign commercial resources and
with KLTCB's domestic currency lending rate. The effective lending rate
would be positive in real terms; the proposed relending rate formula
therefore appears satisfactory.
/1 The average difference between the nominal and effective lending rate was
11.8% p.a. This interest rate differential could be broken down into
6.5% p.a. representing the average annual depreciation of the Won vis a
vis the US dollar and 5.3% p.a. representing the average annual apprecia-
tion (vis-a-vis the dollar) of the non US dollar currencies disbursed by
the Bank.

Agreements and Understandings Reached at Negotiations
4.16      During loan negotiations, the Bank and the Government reached the
following agreements:
(a) the Government would formulate a "Statement of Korea-s Financial
Sector Policy Improvements". The statement would express the broad
objectives of the financial sector reform and specify a number of
policy measures to be implemented over time (para. 2.43); these
policy measures are presented in a Supplemental Letter which will
be attached to the Guarantee Agreement;
(b) a specific time frame discussed and agreed upon for completion of
the financial policy measures and studies listed in the "Statement
of Korea's Financial Sector Policy Improvements";
(c) the package of policy measures linked to the proposed loan
comprises (i) a reduction in the scope of priority activities
qualifying for financing under NIF; (ii) a restriction in the
administrative scope of NIF lending to the specialized banks and
KDB; (iii) harmonization of lending rates for foreign currency
funds raised from official resources (4.15); (iv) a higher
interest spread of up to 2% for onlending foreign commercial
borrowings (4.11); and
(d)  a detailed study of the NIF program would be undertaken by the
Government and completed by December 31, 1981.
4.17      In addition, the following agreements and/or understandings were
reached with KLTCB:
(a) the final onlending rate for the proceeds of the proposed loan
will be based on the formula agreed upon with the Government
(para. 4.15);
(b) Bank funds would be allocated to enterprises which are committed
to improving their financial structure and qualify under a specific
debt/equity ratio (para. 4.04);
(c) the amortization schedule of subloans co-funded with foreign
commercial borrowings would be adjusted (para. 4.10);
(d) the free limit on subloans will be raised to $5 million (para.
4.12);
(e) a ceiling of $10 million will be applied to individual subloans
(para. 4.13); and
(f) a long-term debt/equity limit of 10:1 will be observed by KLTCB
(para. 4.14).



- 39 -
4.18      Recommendation.  A Bank loan of $90 million is recommended which
is expected to finance 27% of KLTCB's estimated foreign currency commit-
ments over the two-year period 1981-82.

KOREA
THE KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) was established
in 1967 as a privately owned development finance company. KDFC was estab-
lished with the active assistance of the World Bank Group which contributed
to its capitalization through a first IBRD loan of US$5 million and an
equity investment by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) amounting
to 14.3% of KDFC's initial share capital. Since 1967, KDFC has received a
substantial proportion of its foreign exchange resources through seven IBRD
loans totalling US$320 million. In addition to participating in the initial
share capital, IFC subscribed to three subsequent rights issues but later sold
part of its shareholding. In May 1980, KDFC increased its share capital
from W1O billion to W50 billion as a prerequisite for conversion into a Long-
Term Credit Bank. As of June 2, 1980, IFC's holding amounted to 5% of the
share capital of the Korea Long-Term Credit Bank (KLTCB).
KDFC's Role Within the Financial Sector
1.02      KDFC was established to provide medium and long-term financial
assistance to the private sector. At present, KDFC is the only privately
owned development finance company in Korea. While KDFC primarily provides
financing for large private manufacturing enterprises, its clients are at the
lower end of the large industry spectrum and tend to be firms which are not
being actively backed by the Government. Consequently KDFC's role tends to
be complementary to that of KDB. Over the period 1971-78 approximately 75%
of KDFC's loans on a disbursement basis went to the manufacturing sector,
financing 2.2% of gross domestic capital formation in this sector (Table 1)
not being actively backed by the Government. Consequently KDFC's role tends
to be complementary to that of KDB. Over the period 1971-78 approximately
75% of KDFC's loans on a disbursement basis went to the manufacturing sector,
financing 2.2% of gross domestic capital formation in this sector (Table 1).
Until now, KDFC has operated primarily as a lender of foreign exchange
resources; as of December 31, 1979, 96.5% of KDFC's outstanding loan
portfolio was in foreign exchange and the remaining 3.5% in domestic
currency. KDFC has been unable to increase its domestic currency lending
operations in the past since, by law, it was not permitted to accept
deposits or issue debentures for onlending purposes./l   In order to remove
this constraint and expand the scope of its operations, KDFC has converted
into a Long-Term Credit Bank (LTCB) on June 2, 1980.
/1 Unlike other financial institutions, KDFC was established under the
Commercial Code, not the General Banking Act. Under the Commercial
Code, a corporation may issue won debentures to the extent of the aggre-
gate amount of its paid-in capital and reserves. However, the corpora-
tion is prohibited from onlending the proceeds of the debenture as such
action contravenes the provisions of the General Banking Act.

2. CONVERSION TO A LONG-TERM CREDIT BANK
Justification for Long-Term Credit Banks
2 01       The Government-owned development finance companies have been able to
mobilize a part of their domestic currency requirements, mainly short-term,
through acceptance of deposits. However, sources of long-term finance have
been practically limited to share capital and retained earnings as the Korean
securities market was not particularly well developed. On the other hand, the
demand for long-term resources has risen substantially owing to the increasing
volume of investments in the heavy and chemical sectors which have longer
gestation periods, investment in these sectors as a proportion of total
manufacturing investment increased from 46.2% in 1973 to 56.2% in 1978. The
demand for long-term funds is being met primarily by government-directed
lending programs such as the National Investment Fund (NIF). A significant
proportion of the demand is also financed through foreign currency resources.
KDB estimates that in 1978, 47.2% of the equipment finance needs of the
domestic private sector were financed through foreign loans.
2.02       In its Five-Year Economic Development Plan (1977-81), the Government
has explicitly stated that it would increasingly aim at substituting foreign
capital inflows with domestic savings for investment financing. To achieve
this objective an increasing volune of long-term domestic savings needs to be
mobilized. The corporate bond market, though thin and still relatively
underdeveloped, has grown rapidly during the period 1975-78 and is deemed to
have substantial potential for domestic resource mobilization. In 1979,
approximately W 623 billion was raised through corporate bonds and in addi-
tion, government-owned/controlled institutions like KDB and Korea Exchange
Bank (KEB) issued debentures to the tune of W 100 billion and W 30 billion,
respectively.  In order to further encourage domestic resource mobilization,
the Government, in December 1979, passed legislation for the establishment
of long-term credit banks (LTCB). The legislation defines a LTCB as an
institution whose principal business is to lend equipment finance and
long-term working capital funded through the issuance of long-term credit
debentures instead of deposits.
The Korea Long-Term Credit Bank (KLTCB)
2.03       KDFC has been successful in raising foreign currency funds for
onlending, but had not, so far, been legally permitted to mobilize domestic
currency funds for onlending. In the past, KDFC did not find it a
constraint to operate with a low volume of domestic currency resources as
most of its clients principally wanted foreign exchange funds for importing
equipment. However, as more capital goods were being produced domestically,
an increasing proportion of its clients wanted a mix of domestic and foreign
currency resources.  To overcome this constaint and be able to expand the
scope of its operations, KDFC decided to convert into a LTCB. The LTCB

ANNEX B
Page 3
legislation was approved by the National Assembly in December 1979 and KDFC
became the first LTCB in Korea on June 2, 1980. Since its conversion, KDFC
is known as the Korea Long-Term Credit Bank (KLTCB)./1
2.04      The major changes occurring as a result of the conversion are as
follows:
(a) Financial Activities. The scope of KDFC's financial operations
was significantly expanded.

(b)  Financial Base.  By law, the minimum paid-in share capital of a
LTCB has to be W 50 billion. As of December 31, 1979, KDFC had a
paid-in share capital of W 10 billion. KDFC raised the additional
W 40 billion in May 1980 through a 50% stock dividend (W 5 billion)
and a W 35 billion additional share issue;
(c)  Board of Directors.  The number of seats on the Board has been
increased from 15 to 20;
(d)  Board/Management Responsibility.  The Board retains responsibi-
lity for policy decisions including formulation of KLTCB's Statement
of Investment and Operational Policies. However, all investment
decisions are delegated to the Executive Directors Meeting;
(e)  LTCB Supervision.  As an LTCB, the new institution will be
supervised by the Ministry of Finance. The supervision/reporting
requirements are similar to those of other Korean banks; and
(f)  Organization and Staffing.  In order to manage the expanded volume
of existing operations and the new types of financial operations
to be undertaken, the professional staff has already been increased
substantially.
Financial Activities
2.05      Resource Mobilization.  The KLTCB will be permitted to raise domes-
tic currency resources through acceptance of deposits and issuance of
debentures.
(a)  Deposits and Installment Savings.  KLTCB is allowed to accept
deposits but only from local governments or business enterprises to
which KLTCB has extended any form of financial assistance.
(b)  Debenture Issues.  KLTCB proposes to issue debentures for a total
of W 10 billion in 1980, W 30 billion in 1981 and W 50 billion in
1982.
The interest on the debentures issued by KLTCB, like those of KDB,
will be tax exempt except for defense tax. KLTCB proposes to
issue both discount and coupon debentures. The nominal discount
rate on its one-, two- and three-year discount debentures would be
22.2%, 19.9%, and 17.9%, respectively. Effective yields on a
compounded basis would be 28.5%, 28.9% and 29.3%, respectively.
The comparable effective yield on KDB's discount debentures of the
same maturity is currently 27.9%, 28.4% and 29.0%, respectively.
The nominal interest rate on KLTCB-s coupon debentures having a
maturity of two-, three-, four or five years would be 26.5%, 26.9%,
27.4% and 28.0%, respectively. Owing to interest prepayment, the



- 61 -
ANNEX B
Page 5
effective yield would be 29.3%, 29.7%, 30.3% and 31.1%, respective-
ly. In comparison, KDB issues a coupon debentures with a five-year
maturity only, at a nominal interest rate of 24% and an effective
yield of 29.1%. On both its discount and coupon debentures, KLTCB
would offer a marginally higher yield than KDB because unlike KLTCB
debentures, KDB bonds are government-guaranteed. Corporate
debentures, on the other hand, tend to have a maturity of two
years and an effective yield of 33.5% for (bank) guaranteed bonds
and 36.5% for nonguaranteed bonds. Corporate debentures are not
tax exempt. The tax on debenture income is 5% for individuals and
35% for corporations. The tax holiday on KLTCB debentures should
make them particularly attractive to corporate buyers. The nominal
and effective yield of various types of financial instruments is
given in Table 2.
The average cost to KLTCB of its debenture issues would depend
upon the mix of discount and coupon debentures and on the maturity
mix. On current assumptions, the average funding cost is estimated
at about 31.1% including an average issuing cost of 3%. As of
March 1980, KDFC's nominal lending rates varied between 28% and 29%
with an effective yield (through interest prepayment) of 33.7% and
35.1% respectively./l Even at these rates, KDFC finds that the
demand for domestic currency resources far exceeds the supply.
Consequently, the spread after issuing costs accruing to KLTCB on
present assumptions would be between 2-3.5%.
2.06      New Operations.  As a result of its increased volume of domestic
currency resources, KLTCB expects to start lending short-term working capital
for which the demand is considerable. At present, the organized financial
sector is not able to satisfy this demand and a large number of even well
established firms are being forced to turn to the Unorganized Money Market
(UMM) for financing. KLTCB will also be permitted to undertake foreign
exchange transactions such as opening letters of credit. In addition, KLTCB
will be permitted to go into the securities business through underwriting,
selling and guaranteeing investments.
Share Capital
2.07      As of December 31, 1979 the paid-in share capital of KLTCB
amounted to W 10 billion. In order to convert into a LTCB, KDFC has had to
increase its share capital. According to the LTCB law: "A long-term credit
/1 The effective rate on short-term loans from short-term financing companies
and merchant banks is 35.6% and 34.8%, respectively. For term loans, the
effective rate varies between 29.5% for a three-year commercial bank loan
to 35.9% for a three-year merchant bank loan.

bank shall be a limited liability company with a paid-in capital of not less
than W 50 billion." In order to raise its paid-in share capital from W 10
billion to W 50 billion, the shareholders- meeting of February 1980 agreed
to a 50% stock dividend thereby increasing the total paid-in share capital
to W 15 billion. The remaining W 35 billion was raised from existing and
new shareholders. The new shares have been issued at par (W 1,000/share),
although the market price of KDFC shares was lower (W 750-800/share) than
par. Consequently, many of KDFC's previous shareholders decided to waive
their rights. The previous shareholders subscribed to 13.4 million shares
(W 13.4 billion). Hence, an additional W 21.6 billion had to be raised from
new shareholders, primarily business/industrial groups in Korea. As of
June 2, 1980, foreign shareholders accounted for 21.58% of KLTCB-s share
capital; IFC's holding was 5%. Domestic shareholders accounted for 77.42%
of which industrial companies accounted for 43.7% and commercial banks for
21.6%. KLTCB-s ownership is shown in Table 3.
Board of Directors
2.08      In February 1979, KDFC-s Board of Directors was increased from 13
to 15. Following the conversion to a LTCB the number of directors was further
increased from 15 to 20. Of these, 7 are from KLTCB, 9 represent domestic
shareholders while the remaining 4 represent foreign shareholders; IFC
continues to have a seat on the Board. A list of KLTCB-s Board of Directors
is given in Table 4.
Board/Management Responsibility
2.09      Prior to the KLTCB conversion, authority to conduct KDFC-s opera-
tions and to approve loans and investments up to US$5 million was delegated
to an executive committee. The Executive Committee comprised four Board
members including the KDFC Chairman and President, plus one representative
each of the Korean and foreign shareholders. After the conversion, all
investment decisions irrespective of size are made by the Executive Directors
Meeting comprising the Chairman of the Board, the President, Deputy President
and the Managing Directors. The Board, however, continues to play an
important role in policy formulation.
Organization and Staffing
2.10      Tables 5 and 6 show the Organization Chart and Staff position of
KDFC as of December 31, 1979. At that date, KDFC had a staff of 163, of whom
12 were executives and managers and 84 were professionals. The quality of
KDFC-s professional staff in terms of both academic and professional back-
ground remains excellent and is reflected in the performance of KDFC. As
a result of the conversion, KDFC estimates that its staff in 1980 will
increase to 245. Of these, 17 will be executives and managers and 130 will
be professionals. KDFC does not anticipate any problems recruiting the addi-
tional staff. In preparation of the conversion, KDFC had started recruiting
in early 1980 22 experienced professionals and 40 college graduates.

ANNEX B
Page 7
Project Appraisal and Supervision
2.11      Project Appraisal.  KDFC's appraisal work continues to be of a high
standard. The evaluation of a project's financial, marketing and technical
aspects is thorough; in dealing with the technical aspects of projects, KDFC
has been drawing heavily on the expertise of KIST. KDFC has recently expanded
the coverage of its project appraisals by focusing on enery-related issues
such as alternative sources of energy and energy saving techniques. In
addition, the ecological implications of projects are also evaluated in
accordance with the Pollution Prevention Act of 1971 and the Environmental
Conservation Act of 1977. Since 1973, the ERR is routinely calculated for
projects seeking foreign exchange financing in excess of US$1 million,
irrespective of the source of financing. Owing to the high quality of
KDFC's appraisal reports they have often been used as training material by
other Korean and some foreign financial institutions. Project appraisal
reports are prepared by an appraisal team comprising a number of the senior
management of the project departments, an engineer and another staff member.
The average time for project processing varies between 5-7 weeks. The
prudent selection of subprojects is reflected in the very high quality of
KDFC's loan portfolio.
2.12      Project Supervision.  KDFC has had independent appraisal and
supervision units until 1978, since then appraisal and supervision is
carried out by the same unit. KDFC currently has two
appraisal-cun-supervision units specializing along industry lines. Previous
IBRD appraisal reports had commented on the inaccurate and infrequent
reporting by clients on the progress of projects making the timely detection
of problem projects difficult. KDFC has successfully dealt with this
problem by tightening up its client's reporting requirements and by devising
a system for monitoring actual financial and economic benefits. Regular
reports from clients now include progress reports at different stages of
construction, and project completion reports; special reports are prepared
for problem projects.
Procurement and Disbursement
2.13      KDFC's procurement and disbursement procedures are designed to
ensure an efficient and appropriate use of funds. KDFC normally requires a
reasonable degree of competition, involving a comparison of at least three
quotations from potential suppliers. In 1979, the equipment requirements
under 31 loans, involving about US$64 million in KDFC financing, were pro-
cured in this manner. In qualifying cases, KDFC insists on international
competitive bidding, and in 1979 one loan involving US$0.8 million used this
method of procurement. More frequently, and particularly for expansion
projects, the specifications and technology of existing equipment
effectively compels the procurement of new equipment from the same supplier.
In 1979 such contractual procurement was made for 58 loans involving nearly



- 64 -                            ANNEX B
Page 8
US$55 million. In all cases of project procurement the merit of various
alternative methods and offers are evaluated jointly by the subborrower and
the project Department. The final procurement contract is subject to KDFC's
approval and disbursements are subsequently authorized against submission of
satisfactory documents and progress reports on project implementation. KDFC
closely monitors the procurement process and also collects extensive data on
the actual expenditure of its loans.
3. OPERATIONS
Overall Lending Operations
3.01      KDFC-s financial assistance comprised:  (i) term loans in foreign
and domestic currency; (ii) convertible debentures and equity investments in
domestic currency.  Since 1979, KDFC has started operating a revolving fund to
meet the short-term foreign exchange needs of its borrowers./l KDFC's
guarantee operations are negligible. -A summary of KDFC-s operations through
end 1979 is given in Table 7. As of December 31, 1979, KDFC's total
outstanding loan portfolio amounted to W 184.5 billion of which 96.3% was in
foreign currency and 3.7% in domestic currency.
Foreign Currency Lending Operations
3.02      Cumulative foreign currency loan approvals for the period 1968-79
amounted to W 242.1 billion for 461 loans.  Considerable fluctuations have
taken place in the year-to-year pattern of loan approvals, as a result of
resource availability.
Domestic Currency Lending Operations
3.03      KDFC's domestic currency resources have been very limited and
domestic currency financing has been viewed as an ancillary service provided
to borrowers of foreign currency. The scarcity of domestic currency
resources is reflected in the fact that over the period 1968-78, only 6.2% of
KDFC-s net loan approvals were in domestic currency.
Characteristics of KDFC-s Lending Operations
3.04      Sectoral Distribution.  Table 8 indicates the sectoral distribution
of KDFC-s loan approvals for the period 1968-79. Over the entire period
manfacturing has accounted for between 60% and 80% of loan approvals. Among
/1 The revolving fund is funded from foreign exchange resources which are
repaid to KDFC prior to the due date to KDFC-s lenders. KDFC tries to
match the maturity of the revolving fund loans with those of its own
repayments.

nonmanufacturing activities, marine transportation has been consistently the
most important, accounting for as much as 30.7% of loan approvals in 1976.
The allocation of loans within the manufacturing sector has changed over time.
Although KDFC, as a privately owned institution, does not operate any of the
Government's directed lending programs, it has consistently attempted to
allocate resources in line with government's priorities as indicated in the
table below:
ALLOCATION OF MANUFACTURING LOANS
(%)
1975    1976    1977    1978    1979
Manufacturing sector                   100     100      100      100     100
Heavy and chemical sector            38.4    51.2    69.9    89.6    73.9
The growth of KDFC's lending in the heavy and chemical sector during the
period 1975-78 and the subsequent decline in 1979 are in line with government
priorities. Until 1978, the Government had urged increased investment in the
heavy and chemical sector. However, in 1979 it was felt that some over
investment had occured in this sector and that more resources should be
allocated to the production of consumer goods in order to help reduce
inflation.
3.05      Size Distribution of Loans.  Table 9 summarizes the geographic and
size distribution of KDFC's loans over the period 1968-79. The size of loans
made by KDFC has increased over time. During the period 1968-74, 41.8% of
all loans made were under W 4 billion. The comparable figure for 1979 was
14.4%. The increased loan size has occurred both as a result of inflation and
the increased lending by KDFC for heavy and chemical industries. Loan
maturities have also changed quite significantly. During the period 1968-74,
loans under five years, between five to nine years and over nine years
accounted for 12.3%, 49.8% and 37.9% respectively of all loans. The
comparable figures for 1978-9 were 6.4%, 13.8%, and 79.8%, respectively,
showing that an increasing proportion of KDFC lending is long term.
3.06      Geographical Distribution.  Over the period 1968-79, there has been
a good dispersal of loans. Excluding the fishing and marine transportation
industries, Seoul accounted for 30% of all loans in 1968-74 and 18.8% for the
period 1975-79. On the other hand, the proportion of loans going to Kyung-Gi
province, which surrounds Seoul, has remained almost the same: 31.3% for the
period 1968-74 as against 30.4% for the period 1975-79. The volume of loans
going to North Kyung-Sang Province, which is a major textile area, increased



66 -
ANNEX B
Page 10
sharply in 1978 and 1979 compared to the preceding period probably reflecting
increased investment in the textile industry during this period as a result
of the Government-s decision to increase output for the domestic market.
The proportion of loans to the South Kyung-Sang Province also rose sharply
in 1979.
3.07      Financing of Small and Medium Enterprises.  In line with government
priorities, KDFC has actively tried to promote small and medium enterprises
(SMEs)./I This was achieved through direct KDFC loans to SMEs or indirectly
through collaboration with Regional Commercial Banks (RCBs). The financial
assistance provided by KDFC to SMEs comprises loans, debenture and equity
investments (Table 10). Over the period 1975-79, loans approved by KDFC for
SME amounted to W 3,917 billion, or 19.8% of KDFC-s total approvals. By
number, 164 loans were approved for SME out of total approvals of 398 or
41.2%. The value of loans to SMEs as a proportion of the loan portfolio has
fluctuated between 28.7% and 16.7% over the period 197679. Over the same
period, KDFC-s debenture and equity investments in 9MEs represented 25.5%
and 17.2% of its debenture and equity portfolio respectively.
3.08       Investment Operations.  A summary of KDFC-s investment operations
is presented in Table 11. Over the period 1968-79, equity participations
and convertible debentures accounted for 28% and 13%, respectively of
KDFC's domestic resource operations on an approval basis. As of end 1979,
54.6% of the equity participations was in listed companies and 45.4% in
unlisted ones. In terms of sectoral distribution, 56.4% of its equity is
in manufacturing companies, while banking and insurance accounts for a
further 36.9%. Within the manufacturing sector, 90% of KDFC-s equity
investments are in the heavy and chemical sector.
3.09      Over the period 1968-79, KDFC, on an approval basis, invested
W 3.3 billion in bonds and convertible debentures. Of these, 36.5% were in
listed companies and the remaining 63.5% in unlisted companies. In terms of
sectoral distribution, 83% were in manufacturing, 9.1% in construction and
7.9% in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Within the manufacturing
sector, over 80% of bonds and convertible debentures are in the heavy and
chemical sector. Hence, through its loan, equity and debenture assistance
KDFC has, in line with government priorities, tried to provide the heavy
and chemical industries with the necessary mix of financial assistance.
/1 The official definition of SMEs are those enterprises with total assets
not exceeding W 500 million ($860,000) or employing less than 300
employees.

Characteristics of KDFC's Outstanding Investment Portfolio
3.10      The sectoral distribution of KDFC's outstanding investment port-
folio /1 is given in Table 12. As of December 31, 1979, 67% of KDFC's
portfolio was invested in manufacturing, 16.5% in transportation, 6.4% in
agriculture, forestry and fisheries and 4.8% in banking and insurance.
Within the manufacturing sector, light industries accounted for 26% of the
portfolio; among light industries, textiles were by far the most important.
The heavy and chemical sector accounted for the remaining 74% of KDFC's
manufacturing portfolio. Within the heavy and chemical sector, chemicals,
rubber and plastics were the most important followed by metal products and
nonmetallic mineral products.
Utilization of Bank Loan No. 1635-KO
3.11      As of December 31, 1979, KDFC had approved and committed US$92.9
million of the proceeds of the seventh Bank loan (US$100 million) for 75 sub-
projects; the US$10 million subloan to the Korea Development Leasing Corpora-
tion (KDLC) being considered as one subproject (Table 13). The total project
cost of these subprojects was $272.5 million with 55% in domestic currency
and 45% in foreign exchange. KDFC's total financing amounted to $125.7
million, of which IBRD resources accounted for 74% ($93.5 million). In
keeping with KDFC's overall portfolio, approximately 80% of the projects
financed were for expansion. In terms of sectoral distribution, 28.5% of
KDFC's financing went to metal industries, 8.2% to chemicals and 8.2% to
nonmetallic products. The corresponding figures from the IBRD component
were 17.2%, 9.9% and 9.7% respectively. Financial rates of return varied
between 16.4% and 37.7% while economic rates of return ranged from 11% to
48.6%.
3.12      In order to support medium-sized labor-intensive projects, it was
agreed that at least 20% of the seventh IBRD loan (US$100 million) be utilized
to finance projects with either total fixed assets of less than W 500 million
or a fixed investment cost per job of less than $12,500. As of December 31,
1979, total Bank funds of $93.5 million had been utilized. Of which $17.3
million, or 18.5%, went to projects which met the above criteria. These
figures, however, underestimate the share of medium-sized labor-intensive
projects since the $10 million loan to KDLC was counted as one subproject
and consequently did not meet the IBRD SHE criteria. If KDLC subprojects
meeting the IBRD eligibility criteria were also considered, the SME
component of the seventh IBRD loan would exceed the 20% requirement.
3.13      In terms of employment creation, estimates made at the time of loan
approval indicate that IBRD-financed subprojects will generate 5,965 jobs at
a cost per job ranging between $10,000 and $540,000 with an overall average
cost per job of $45,812, in general, the projects with a high cost per job
tend to be in the heavy and chemical sectors.

4. KDFC's ECONOMIC IMPACT
Economic Impact of KDFC's Lending
4.01      Table 14 summarizes the partial economic indicators of the 513
projects financed by KDFC since the start of its operations in 1968 to end
1979. The aggregate investment cost of these projects is estimated at W 682
billion of which KDFC financed W 247.7 billion or 36.3%./1
4.02      Scale of Output and Value Added of KDFC Project.  The 513 projects
financed by KDFC over the period 1968-79 are expected to generate incremental
annual sales and value added of W 1,271 billion and W 450.6 billion respec-
tively. Both the sales and value added per employee have risen steadily
over the same period probably reflecting the increased volume of lending
going to more capital intensive projects in the heavy and chemical sectors.
Disaggregated data shows that the partial economic indicators varied
significantly between KDFC projects proper, KDLC projects and RCB projects
(Table 15). In 1978 KDFC financed 53 projects with a project cost of W 120
billion, KDLC financed 36 projects for W 13.4 billion and RCB financed 19
projects for W 5.4 billion. The sales per employee for KDFC projects were
estimated at W 40.9 million while for KDLC and RCB projects it was approxi-
mately W 24.7 million. Similarly, the value-added per employee for KDFC was
estimated at W 15.2 million while it was approximately half that for KDLC
and RCB projects. In 1979, KDFC financed 89 projects with a project cost of
W 181.6 billion while 7 RCB projects were financed for W 2.5 billion. No
KDLC projects were financed in 1979 as the KDFC loan to KDLC for $10 million
had been fully committed by then. The additional sales per employee for
KDFC loans in 1979 was W 49.7 million as against W 15.8 million for RCB
loans. The comparable value added per employee figures were W 21.3 million
and W 8.3 million respectively./2
4.03      Employment  Creation.  During the period 1968-79 it is estimated
that KDFC-supported projects created about 44,581 jobs or about 1.5% of
manufacturing employment. The fixed investment cost per job for all KDFC
financed projects was W 11.4 million in 1975-76 but rose to W 17.6 million
in 1978 and W 25.6 million in 1979. At a more disaggregate level, the fixed
asset cost per job of KDFC projects proper in 1978 was W 20.1 million while
for the KDFC/RCB-financed projects it was W 5.5 million./3 The comparable
/1   On an approval basis.
/2   This excludes an estimated 2,111 jobs created during 1976-78 by KDLC-s
leasing subprojects assisted by two KDFC loans of US$5 million and
US$10 million respectively.
/2   The fixed asset cost per job of KDFC financed KDLC projects in 1978 was
W 15.2 million.



- 69 -                           ANNEX B
Page 13
figures for 1979 were W 26.3 million and W 9.6 million respectively. The
sharp increase in the cost per job of KDFC projects probably results from
both the increased volume of lending to more capital-intensive projects
in the heavy and chemical sector and the general level of inflation.
4.04      Contribution to Exports.  Over the period 1968-79 KDFC financed
projects having incremental annual export sales of $846.6 million which
represented about 33% of annual incremental sales. The net foreign exchange
earnings and savings for the same period is estimated at $686.3 million.
Approximately one-third of the projects approved by KDFC in the period 1975-
79 exported more than half of their output (Table 16).
Resource Mobilization
4.05      The following table shows that KDFC's ability to lend is a function
of its ability to mobilize sufficient borrowings (in W billion):

The higher volume of loans outstanding compared to borrowings shows that KDFC
has been using part of its equity resources to finance its domestic currency
lending. However, this can only be done to a limited extent as 40-45% of its
equity resources have been utilized by KDFC to finance its investment port-
folio.
4.06      Foreign Currency Resource Mobilization.  Terms and Conditions of
KDFC-s long-term borrowings are given in Table 17. Since foreign currency
lending accounts for 96-97% of KDFC-s portfolio, mobilization of foreign



- 70 -
ANNEX B
Page 14
resources is critical.  KDFC's performance has been quite satisfactory in
this respect and foreign currency borrowings outstanding have grown at about
36% p.a. over the past three years. Until 1975, KDFC relied enirely on
official sources of funds for its foreign borrowings. IFC was instrumental
in introducing KDFC to foreign commercial lenders through a $17.8 million
loan syndicated in 1976. In the following years, KDFC raised on its own $20
million from Citibank in 1977, $30 million from Deutsche Bank in 1978 and
$50 million from Industrial Bank of Japan in 1979. Commercial borrowings of
about $100 million are expected in 1980. The following table summarizes
KDFC's mobilization performance on a commitment basis over the period
1976-79 (in $ million):
SOURCES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RESOURCES
1976       1977          1978        1979      Total
Amount  %   Amount  %   Amount  %   Amount  %  Amount  %
Official sources    42.0  70.2    70  77.8  100   76.9  50   50.0  262.0  69.0
Commercial sources  17.8  29.8    20  22.2   30   23.1  50   50.0  117.8  31.0

Over the four-year period under review, KDFC's aggregate reliance on official
borrowings has declined to 69%.  It took KDFC nine years before being able
to mobilize its first foreign commercial borrowings. However, it is now
in a position to increase the proportion of its foreign currency resources
coming from commercial borrowings. Over the period 1980-82, KDFC expects to
reduce further its reliance on official sources to about 50%.
4.07      Domestic Currency Resource Mobilization.  KDFC has been much less
successful in mobilizing domestic currency than foreign currency. Since its
establishment in 1967 through end-1979, KDFC had mobilized aggregate domestic
resources of W 23.4 billion; 42.6% originated from its share capital, 33.2%
from reserves, 16.2% from noncash charges and 8% from a government
subordinated loan obtained in 1967.
4.08      KDFC has not been able to mobilize adequate amounts of domestic
currency resources because, by law, it was not permitted to accept deposits
nor to issue debentures for on-lending purposes. To overcome this constraint,
KDFC has converted into a Long-Term Credit Bank (LTCB). The May 1980
increase in KLTCB's share capital from W 10 billion to W 50 billion has pro-
vided W 35 billion in cash which should cover most of KLTCB's domestic
currency requirements in 1980-81. However, KLTCB expects to issue domestic
currency debentures in 1980 for W 10 billion.  Issuances in 1980 and 1981



- 71 -                           ANNEX B
Page 15
are projected to be W 30 billion and W 50 billion respectively. KLTCB
expects that the availability of these domestic currency resources will
allow its domestic currency lending to reach the equivalent of $55 million
and $75 million on an approval basis in 1980 and 1981 respectively. By
1982, domestic currency lending is expected to account for 43% of its total
lending operations compared to 5.4% in 1979.
Promotional Activities
4.09      Development Strategy Statements have been adopted by KDFC over the
past few years which outline specific medium-term promotional objectives
and the institutional mechanism through which they can be achieved. Major
objectives are: development of the financial system; mobilization of
foreign currency resources; development of industrial linkages and
diversification of portfolio. The mechanisms used by KDFC to achieve these
objectives are discussed below.
4.10      Korea Development Leasing Corporation (KDLC).  Until 1972, there was
no leasing company in Korea. The potential demand for leasing was, however,
considerable since many enterprises, particularly small and medium, were
unable to obtain medium- and long-term financing to purchase equipment owing
to inadequate collateral.  In such cases, leasing is an attractive alterna-
tive as the ownership of the equipment rests with the lessor. The first
leasing company, a wholly owned subsidiary of KDB, was established in 1972
and contributed to the drafting of the Law on "Promotion of the Leasing
Industry" which was enacted in 1973.
4.11      In response to the market demand for leasing, KDLC was established
in 1975 by KDFC and the Orient Leasing Company (OLC) of Japan. KDLC has an
authorized and fully paid-in share capital for W 3 billion. Domestic share-
holders hold 51% of its shares, the remaining 49% being held by foreign
shareholders. Its major shareholders are KDFC (30.8%), OLC (29%) and IFC
(10%).
4.12      KDLC writes financial leases for industrial, agricultural, trans-
port, construction and medical equipment. As of end 1979, KDLC had written
247 contracts for W 62 billion (US$107 million). As mentioned above, through
leasing, small and medium enterprises have been able to obtain what in
effect is an unsecured loan. The major proportion of KDLC's business was
with SMEs; in 1979, 72% of the number of leases and 63% by value went to
SMEs. The rapid growth of leasing has also indirectly helped to develop the
domestic capital goods industry as some of the leasing equipment is
domestically produced; KDLC increased its domestically procured equipment
from 12% of total purchased equipment in 1978 to 14% in 1979.
4.13      KDLC's growth has been more than satisfactory; its leasing market
share was 40.3% in 1979. The major constraint faced by KDLC has been
inadequate funds. For this reason a $5 million subloan was made by KDFC to



-72 -                           ANNEX B
Page 16
KDLC from the proceeds of the sixth Bank loan (No. 1635-KO); a $10 million
subloan was also made from the seventh IBRD loan (1145-KO) to KDFC.
During the period 1976-79, these two subloans have been allocated to 63
projects. The sectoral and geographic distribution is given in Table 18.
4.14      Korea Investment and Finance Corporation (KIFC).  Prior to 1971,
the short-term financial needs of less than prime borrowers were being met
by the Unorganized Money Market at very high interest rates. A study of the
financial sector undertaken at the time concluded that such funding needs
should be met by institutions dealing in short-term credit instruments.
It was against this background that KIFC was established in 1971 under the
joint sponsorship of KDFC and IFC as a money market/investment banking
financial intermediary. KIFC became the first institution to operate under
the Short-Term Financing Business Law enacted in September 1972; subse-
quently, 15 other short-term financing companies were established.
4.15      KIFC's paid-in share capital was increased to W 6 million and W 10
million in 1978 and 1979, respectively; 67% of the current share capital is
held by domestic shareholders (of which KDFC owns 24%) and 33% by foreign
shareholders (of which IFC owns 17%). KIFC-s operations have grown rapidly;
its discounted notes outstanding amounted to W 79.4 billion in 1979, a 47%
increase over end 1978. KIFC has helped develop the money market by issuing
short-term paper; in 1979, KIFC paper outstanding amounted to W 63 billion
equivalent to 59% of total short-term notes outstanding. KIFC has also
contributed to the promotion of the capital market by managing the
underwriting of share issues (W 1.4 billion in 1979) and bond issues (W 11.6
billion in 1979). KIFC also participated in the underwriting of one equity
issue and 33 bond issues. Profitability in terms of net income after tax as a
percentage of average equity was 63% in 1979 despite the recent increases in
KIFC's share capital.
4.16      Korea Technology Advancement Corporation (K-TAC).  Through its
participation in K-TAC, KDFC has helped promote new technologies in Korea.
K-TAC was incorporated in 1974 as a fully owned subsidiary of the Korea
Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) with the objective of promoting the
commercial exploitation of patents and technical processes developed by KIST.
K-TAC has a paid-in share capital of W 683 million; KIST regulations have so
far precluded KDFC from taking an equity participation in K-TAC. KDFC did,
however, provide financial assistance to projects promoted by K-TAC.
4.17      Since its inception, K-TAC has promoted four projects:  bronze
powder; cordierite saggar; agro-chemicals and dument wire production. KDFC
has provided these four projects with financial assistance in the form of
both loans (W 150 million in local currency and US$1.9 million in foreign
currency) and equity (W 346 million). The progress on all four projects has
been satisfactory. The bronze powder project has been operating and plans to
double its production capacity in the face of rapidly increasing market
demand. The cordierite saggar project has started exporting its output.



73 -
Page 17
The agro-chemicals project started operating in mid-1979 while the dument
wire project is still under construction. Most recently, KIST has developed
a technique for abstracting the natural sweetness from Stevita. K-TAC
intends to start this project at a cost of $2.1 million; financing is
currently being reviewed by KDFC.
4.18      KDFC-RCB Assistance to Small Industries.  While KDFC's longer term
objectives are to establish regional offices, KDFC felt it could have an
immediate impact on improving the geographic and size distribution of its
operations by establishing links with some Regional Commercial Banks (RCBs).
KDFC also considered that such a scheme would facilitate lending to SSE in
the more backward areas. Between August 1975 and December 1976, an associa-
tion was developed with four of the ten RCBs. Under this collaboration,
KDFC provides the foreign currency requirements of projects identified and
appraised by the RCBs on the basis of guidelines issued by KDFC. The RCBs
provide the domestic currency financing and are responsible for project
supervision and follow up. To improve the appraisal standard of RCBs, KDFC
has provided training to RCB staff. To finance its scheme with the RCBs,
KDFC earmarked US$5 million out of its fifth IBRD credit line and US$ 7
million from the sixth IBRD loan.
4.19      As of December 1979, KDFC has financed 52 projects for $14.4 million
under its RCB scheme. The main characteristics of the projects are summarized
in Tables 19 and 20. The average size of the loans made by KDFC under the
RCB scheme (US$277,000) is nearly 5 times smaller than the overall average
(US$1.3 million) for KDFC loans. The average investment cost per job
created was US$11,790 as against the overall average US$31,544 indicating
that RCB projects tend to be more labor-intensive than KDFC-s usual
operations. It is clear that through its association with the RCB-s, KDFC
has been successful in financing small enterprises and bringing about a
greater regional dispersal of its loans.
5. FINANCIAL POSITION, PERFORMANCE AND RESOURCES
Financial Position
5.01      Assets.  Audited balance sheets for the period 1975-79 are
summarized in Table 21. As of December 31, 1979, KDFC's total assets
amounted to W 209.2 billion (US$431.3 million) having grown at approximately
40% p.a. over the period 1975-79. The sharp growth in assets was almost
entirely due to the growth in the foreign currency loan portfolio which rose
from W 42.6 billion (US$87.8 million) in 1975 to W 177.7 billion (US$366.4
million) in 1979 or an average annual growth of 42.9%.
5.02      Liabilities and Equity.  As of December 31, 1979, 78% of KDFC's
total assets were financed by long-term liabilities, 12.5% by current liabili-
ties and 9.5% by equity. Foreign currency borrowings accounted for 98.9% of



- 74 -
ANNEX B
Page 18
long-term liabilities. KDFC-s domestic currency borrowings comprise a
government subordinated loan for W 2.025 billion which KDFC started repaying
in 1977. KDFC-s total net worth stood at W 19.8 billion at end-1979. The
paid-in share capital was increased from W 5 billion to W 10 billion in 1978.
5.03       Liquidity and Debt-Equity Ratios.  At end-1979, the long-term debt
equity ratio of KDFC reached to 9.1:1 and was approaching KDFC's contractual
limit of 10:1. The increase in the debt-equity ratio resulted from a sharp
increase in KDFC's lending operations financed entirely by debt. An excellent
collection ratio has enabled KDFC to service its debts punctually.  Both
debt service coverage and interest coverage ratios are satisfactory and so is
KDFC-s liquidity position (Table 24).
Financial Performance
5.04       Earnings.  Income and cash flow statements are summarized in Tables
22 and 23; indicators of financial performance for the period 1975-79 are
shown in Table 24. Despite a decline in KDFC's interest spread from 3.6% in
1975 to 2.5% in 1979 imposed by the government /i KDFC's income before tax
increased from W 1.5 billion in 1975 to W 5.2 billion in 1979 (annual average
growth rate of 36.4%) through a rapid expansion of its loan portfolio.
Simultaneously, KDFC has held its general and administrative expenses under
tight control; the ratio of general and administrative expenses to average
total assets declined from 1.3% in 1975 to 0.9% in 1979. However, declining
spreads on foreign lending have caused a reduction of the return after tax on
total assets from 2.3% in 1975 to 1.8% in 1979.
5.05       Share Prices and Dividends.  Despite increases in share capital in
1976 and again in 1978, earnings per share have been maintained at 37.3% to
41.1% between 1975-79. This has enabled KDFC to pay cash dividends of
20% of par during 1976-78 at a payout ratio of approximately 50%; the compar-
able figures for 1979 were 23% and 61.7% respectively. The market value
of KDFC shares, ranged between W 958 and W 1,270 in 1979 for a par value of W
1,000; KDFC shares have generally traded at a price earnings ratio of between
2.5 and 3.0. The book value/share rose from W 1,729 in 1978 to W 1,960 in
1979.
5.06       Quality of Portfolio.  Tables 25 and 26 show the status of KDFC's
loan portfolio as of December 31, 1979 and Table 27 reflects its collection
performance over the period 1975-79.  With only two loans in arrears at end
1979, the portfolio was in excellent condition. As of December 31, 1979 total
arrears amounted to W 65 million of which W 42 million had been in arrears
/1 The interest spread on foreign currency loans declined from 3.0% to 2.1%
over the period 1975-79.



- 75 -
ANNEX B
Page 19
for under three months and W 23 billion for 3-6 months; the portfolio affected
by arrears amounted to only 0.04%. The collection ratio is also impressive
with collections of principal and interest due in 1979 reaching 99.8%. In
1979, collections against arrears at the beginning of the year were 100%
while collections against new dues amounted to 99.8%. Three loans with an
outstanding balance of $4.8 million were rescheduled for either six months
or one year in 1978. Another three loans with an outstanding balance of
$3.2 million (0.8% of total portfolio) were rescheduled for 6-12 months in
1979. As of December 1979, KDFC-s provisions for doubtful accounts amounted
to 1.4% of its total loan and investment portfolio. Under present conditions
this appears adequate.
Resources and Terms and Conditions of Lending
5.07      Resources.  KDFCGs resource position as of December 31, 1979, is
given in Table 28. Over 85% of KDFC-s resources have been denominated in
foreign currency. To date, IBRD has made seven loans to KDFC totalling
$320 million. ADB has made three loans totalling $120 million. DEG has
made one loan for $2 million. KDFC's first commercial borrowing was an IFC
syndicated loan in 1976 for $17.8 million. Subsequently, loans have been
syndicated by APCO for $20 million in 1977, Deutsche Bank for $30 million in
1978 and Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ)/Bank of Montreal (BOM) for $50 mil-
lion in 1979. Deutsche Bank, IBJ and BOM are all major shareholders of
KDFC. As of December 31, 1979, KDFC had foreign currency resources
available for commitment of $81.5 million and $63.6 million for approval.
5.08      By contrast, domestic currency resources were very thin, consisting
of primarily (76%) of equity resources of W 17.9 billion as of December 31,
1979 and a subordinated government loan (16%). Domestic currency resources
available for commitment and approval as of December 31, 1979, amounted to W
5.1 billion and W 4.9 billion respectively.
5.09      Conditions of Lending.  KDFC's on-lending rates for the latest IBRD
and ADB loans were fixed at 2% above borrowing cost, i.e. 9.35% and 9.6%
respectively; commercial loans have been linked to LIBOR and on-lent at
1.25% above the cost of borrowing. In the case of all foreign exchange
loans the exchange risk is passed on to the subborrowers.  The cost of the
exchange risk has been substantial as the won has been devalued regularly
against the US dollar (from W 269/$l in 1967 to W 580/$1 since January
1980)./1 Since the IBRD and ADB subloans have been partially disbursed in
currencies which have appreciated against the dollar, the cost of the
exchange risk has been substantially greater. KDFC has carried out a study
of the average effective cost to its subborrowers of the third, fourth and
fifth IBRD loans. Using a discounted cash flow technique, the effective
borrowing cost of the three loans was computed at 18.45%, 17.36% and 26.45%
respectively. For the sake of comparison, KDFC charges a nominal rate of
20.5% to 23% on its domestic currency loans.

5.10      Audit.  KDFC's accounts have been audited in keeping with inter-
national accounting standards by Samil Accounting Corporation, a member firm
of the Coopers and Lybrand Group. The reports met with the Bank Group's

6. PROSPECTS AND RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
Future Operations of KLTCB
6.01      Organizational and Development Strategy for 1980-81.  KLTCB's
organizational set up incorporates three new departments established in April
1980 to engage in (i) domestic and foreign exchange operations, (ii)
underwriting and sale of securities, and (iii) acceptance of deposits from
clients and short-term financing. Guidelines for the new activities are
being prepared and recruitment and training of staff is taking place. KLTCB
is also seeking to strengthen relationships with overseas financial
institutions to build up the necessary correspondent and depository bank
networks in order to carry out effectively its new foreign exchange
operations.
6.02      KLTCB's development strategy for 1980-81 aims at identifying and
developing projects that (i) expand employment opportunities, (ii) enhance
production efficiency; and (iii) consume less energy. Continued support will
be given to small- and medium-scale enterprises with about 20% of total
lending directed to SMEs. KLTCB also intends to continue its policy of
bringing about a greater geographical dispersal of investments.
6.03      As of December 31, 1979, 80.6% of KDFC's foreign exchange loans are
secured by payment guarantee issued by other banking institutions.  This
situation resulted largely from the limited scope of financial services
offered by KDFC and the need for its borrowers to seek additional financing
from other banking sources. KDFC's conversion into an LTCB will expand the
range of its operations and should permit increasing reliance on collateral
rather than bank counter guarantees thus lessening the cost of funds to
the borrowers. To compensate for the higher risk which would result, KLTCB
expects to intensify its supervision activities.
6.04      Regarding resource mobilization, KLTCB proposes to reduce further
its dependence on official sources of foreign funds. It also proposes to
raise short- and medium-term domestic currency resources through debenture
issues and by accepting deposits.
Projected Operations
6.05      KLTCB's operational program for the period 1980-84 is given in
Table 29. Foreign currency loan approvals are projected to rise between
10-15% (on a dollar basis) indicating a growth in lending of 7-8% p.a. in

real terms. Domestic currency lending is forecast to increase dramatically
from W 3.2 billion in 1979 to W 152 billion by 1984. Assuming inflation
continues at 20% during the projected period, the growth in real terms would
still be significant. By 1983, domestic currency lending is forecast to
reach the same level as foreign currency lending, namely, US$190 million
p.a.
6.06      If KLTCB is able to mobilize domestic currency resources at the
projected levels, the demand for the funds is likely to be forthcoming.
During the period 1971-78, total disbursements by KDFC to the manufacturing
sector accounted for less than 3% of fixed investment in that sector. It is
also widely known that well-established firms have to turn to the Unorganized
Money Market for their funds as the Organized Financial Sector is not able to
satisfy their requirements. KDFC has already demonstrated its ability to
evaluate projects so that the acquisition of new skills will be limited.
KLTCB's ability to achieve the forecast lending volume will, therefore,
primarily depend on its ability to raise the necessary resources./l
Resource Mobilization
6.07      The resources which KLTCB will need to mobilize to support its
lending program are given in Table 30. With respect to KLTCB plans to reduce
further its dependence on official sources for foreign currency resources,
and increase the proportion of its commercial borrowings. The ratio of
commercial to official borrowings in 1978-79 was 35:65; the projected ratio
for 1980-82 is 48:52 and 66:34 in 1983-84. If Korea-s credit standing in
the international money markets remains unaffected by the recent political
and economic changes in Korea, KLTCB should have no problems in raising the
projected foreign commercial resources as it will be viewed as a prime
borrower.
6.08      On current assumptions, KLTCB should be able to raise the projected
won resources and to onlend the funds with a positive spread. The effective
yield of KLTCB debentures will be very attractive at 28.5%, 28.9% and 29.3%
for one, two, and three-year coupon debentures. Owing to the projected
maturity structure of the won resources mobilized, KLTCB will onlend part of
the resources for working capital purposes. KLTCB also expects to onlend the
proceeds on a medium-term basis through purchase of corporate debentures
issued by its borrowers. KLTCB expects an effective yield of between 33.7%
and 35.1% on such operations. These rates are in line with those charged by
other institutions in the organized financial sector and at these rates
demand far exceeds supply.
/1 The foreign exchange, securities and deposit operations are not analyzed
here in any detail as they would not have a material impact on KLTCB's
financial performance until the end of the projection period.

Forecast Financial Performance and Condition
6.09      The financial statements of KLTCB for the projected period 1980-84
are given in Tables 31, 32 and 33. The recent devaluation should improve
the profitability of KLTCB in 1980 as about 90% of the portfolio is denomi-
nated in foreign currency and interest earnings will increase by about 20%
in won terms. The January 1980 increase in interest rates will enable KLTCB
to increase the return on its local currency loans. In 1980, KLTCB-s total
gross income is expected to double. KLTCB is expected to show a strong
financial performance throughout the projection period. General and adminis-
trative expenses are projected to be contained at 1% of average total assets.
As a consequence of the increase in share capital, earnings per share as a
percentage of par are forecast to fall from 37.3% in 1979 to 25% in 1980 but
would rise to 32.0% by 1983. Cash dividends of 20% of par were paid out by
KDFC during the period 1976-1978 with a payout ratio of about 50%.  In 1979,
a higher cash dividend ratio of 23%/i brought the payout ratio to 62%.  In
order to maintain the cash dividend ratio at 22% in 1981, and 24% in 1981 the
payout ratio is projected to be around 80% which is the maximum permissible
rate. The debt-service coverage is projected to vary between 1.55 and 1.64
during the projected period while the minimum interest coverage ratio is
projected to be 1.28 in 1984. Both these ratios appear to be satisfactory
(Table 34).
Resource Position and Requirements
6.10      Domestic currency commitments are projected to increase from W 5.5
billion in 1979 to W 35.2 billion in 1980 and W 55.1 billion in 1981 (a ten-
fold increase over 1979).  Cumulative domestic currency commitments for the
period 1980-84 are expected to be W 489 billion or 49.6% of KLTCB's total
commitments for the period. These commitments will be financed through KDFC-s
share capital increase (W 35 billion in 1980) and debenture issues. Deben-
ture issues of W 220 billion are projected over 1980-84. Cash generated from
operations and disposal of equity investments will provide additional won
resources.
6.11      Foreign currency commitments are projected to increase less rapidly
than domestic currency commitments. Foreign currency commitments would
increase from $125.3 million in 1979 to $135.9 million in 1980 and $158.0
million in 1981 or a growth of 12.3% p.a. over the period 1979-81. Cumulative
foreign currency commitments for the period 1980-84 are projected to be $851.8
million or 50.4% of KLTCB's total commitments for the period. As of end-1979
KLTCB's uncommitted foreign currency resources stood at US$81.5 million
(comprising $50 million from ADB, $23.7 million from IBJ, $7.2 million from
IBRD, and $0.6 million from other sources). These resources were insufficient
to meet the 1980 commitments projected at $136 million. Over the period
1980-84,KLTCB expects to mobilize $840 million of which $470 million (56%) are
projected to come from commercial sources and $370 million (44%) from official
sources (including the proposed loan).
