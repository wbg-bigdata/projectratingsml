MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OP THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR THE NATIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.      The following report on a proposed Development Credit co India for
SDR 93.2 N (US$114 M equivaLent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms and help finance improved water management in
irrigation projects mainly in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The
proceeds of the credit voul4 be channelled to the participating states in accord-
ance with the Government of India's (COI) standard terms and arrangements for the
financing of State development projects. The exchange risks would be borne by
the GOI.
2.      Background. Agriculture continues to be the dominant sector of the Indian
economy, contributing about 3b% of GNP and directly employing over 70Z of the
total labor force. Foodgrain production accelerated substantially during the
19609 with the advent of the green revolution and the introduction of
high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice. During recent years, output has
continued to increase by about 2.1% per year. The development of irrigation has
been a major factor in improving agricultural performance. Irrigation has con-
tributed directly by increasing the area cropped, reducing crop losses due to
deficient rainfall, and by encouraging diversified cropping and the use of high
yielding varieties of seeds and other improved inputs.
3.      Despite the undoubted achievement of irrigation development, yields in
many irrigated areas are well below potential because irrigation supplies are
unreliable; in addition, the distribution of water is often inequitable, leading
bo overuse in some areas and shortages elsewhere. These problems result from
inadequacies in both the management of irrigation systems and the physical
infrastructure.
4.      Project Objective.  The project aims to increase productivity and farm
incomes in existing irrigation schemes. To achieve this, the project would
provide low-cost infrastructural improvements in selected schemes to support
newly developed, more efficient operating plans. The selection of the three
States reflects past Bank involvement in water management programs in these
States, the promising results that have been obtained, and their demonstrated
interest in participating in the project. The project would also reinforce
institutional capacity at the State and Central levels to improve water manage-
ment more broadly.
5.      Project Description.  The main element of the project is a seven-year
program to plan, implement and monitor improved operation and maintenance in
selected irrigation schemes (see attached Maps). Though focussed on three
states, this program also provides for smaller pilot efforts in other states.
The principal components would be: (i) scheme investments including repairs,



-2-
renovation, additional control structures, measuring devices and upgraded opera-
tion and maintenance (O&M) facilities required to execute improved operational
plans in up to 20 schemes with a total of almost 600,000 ha of irrigated area;
(ii) institutional strengthening; (iii) scheme specific training programs; and
(iv) special studies.
6.      The project would also include two other components related to the
general objectives of improved water management in India: (i) the Maharashtra
Induction Training Program, which will provide training for engineers recruited
into the Maharashtra Irrigation Department; and (ii) an Institutional Strengthen-
ing and Training Fund (ISTF) to be managed and implemented by GO! and state
agencies to finance studies, data collection, and other preparation activities
for possible future irrigation projects.
7.      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$157 N equivalent includ-
ing taxes and duties. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$9.1 M (6%). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in India are given in
Schedule C & D respectively. The Staff AppraisaL Report No. 6468-IN, dated
February 20, 1987, has been circulated separately.
8.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Improving the productivity of existing
investments is a primary objective of GOI in the irrigation sector. While
irrigation has contributed greatly to India's success in increasing foodgrain
production over the past 20 years, the returns to investment have been lower and
less well distributed than they would have been if water management had been
given adequate attention. Improved management of irrigation projects depends
fundamentally on initiatives by field staff who plan, direct, and execute canal
system operations. But agencies such as IDA or the central government can also
have an important and sometimes essential catalytic role in the process. First,
the process of defining a plan of operation promotes constructive questioning of
traditional norms and practices, and provides a forum where new ideas--often
provided by the existing staff--can legitimately be discussed with senior
officers. Second, an outside agency can often bring proven ideas from other
states, or help avoid approaches which have already failed elsewhere. Finally,
by formalizing a plan of operation into a project, with institutional linkages to
the state and central governments, the importance and benefits of improved canal
operation will be highlighted.
9.      Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreements were reached with GOI
and/or the participating states, as appropriate, on: (a) the detailed approval
procedures for those schemes not already appraised and approved by IDA; (b) the
presentation by November 30 each year of detailed project implementation plans;
(c) the timely establishment of permanent Dam Safety Panels of satisfactory
composition and with agreed responsibilities; (d) establishment of a properly
staffed state level O&H Cell in each participating state and the timely funding
and implementation of O&M as agreed in individual NWMP scheme plans; (e) the
preparation, from experience gained in the pilot schemes and other schemes else-
where in the states, and in consultation with IDA, of an appropriate Action Plan
for improving state-wide O&M which will be formulated and initiated by December
3i, 1992; (f) the provision of adequate extension and research support relating
to the project; (g) provision by end-1987 of detailed schedules for the several
GOI and state project training activities not specific to or included in
individual scheme plans; (h) satisfactory mechanisms for approval of activities



-3-
supported by the Institutional Strengthening and Training Fund; and (i) the
maintenance of proper accounts and provision of timely audits. Each of the
states has (relating, in part, to agreements on other Bank Group operations) cost
recovery policies under which recoveries--usually through both user charges and
indirect taxes (e.g., sales tax on incremental marketed production)--cover full
O&K costs and a share of investment costs. The project-supported improvement in
the reliability of irrigation services is expected to enhance collection rates
and farmer willingness to pay. Existing state policies, reinforced by agreements
with the Bank Group, provide a basis for appropriate cost recovery under the
proposed project. Detailed designs for the first year's construction program
have been completed.
10.     Justification and Benefits.  The primary achievement of the project would
be to establish a systematic and replicable approach to improving the utilization
of previously created assets. In this sense, the physical works to be financed
under the project represent in part a catalytic mechanism for introducing opera-
tional improvements. Relatively minor increases in agriculturaL value added
would more than justify the direct costs involved. Production increases are
expected to stem from a combination of changing crop patterns, increasing irriga-
tion intensity and improving yields--all made possible by increased reliability
and improved distribution and efficiency in water deliveries. The economic
analysis of the three schemes to be taken up in the first year of project
implementation indicates an average economic rate of return of 37Z.
11.     Risks.  The major risks associated with the project relate to the plan-
ning, implementation and sustainability of the operational programs to be sup-
ported under the project. It gill take time for the O&M cells being set up in
the states to establish fully the capacity to prepare good operational plans to
the extent needed in the states. Similarly, while the project aims to provide
field staff with the necessary guidance and support, there is no certain guaran-
tee that they will be able to implement agreed programs--especially those involv-
ing changes in water allocation to farmers--in the face of vested interests and
the many other pressures which affect scheme operations. The project's success
will depend on strong and steady support and funding from the state Governments
concerned.
12.     These risks are inherent in many projects in the irrigation sector.  The
project, however, provides significant opportunities for institutional
strengthening and training which, together with firm funding commitments, should
help moderate and resolve such problems in the longer term. While in certain
cases the changes to be introduced may prove difficult to sustain, the potential
agricultural benefits are such that these risks are acceptable, in particular
since there is evidence from on-going schemes to suggest that significant
benefits are achievable at relatively low costs.
13.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association; and recommend that the Execu-
tive Directors approve the proposed credit.
