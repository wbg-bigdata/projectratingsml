Project
Description:              The project will increase agricultural output by
providing farmers with a more reliable and predict-
able irrigation supply. To achieve this objective,
it will strengthen the capacity, primarily in three
participating States, to plan, implement and monitor
improved O&M practices, and will support improvements
in selected schemes in these states to demonstrate
how such an approach can be effective.  Provision
is also made for pilot programs in other states.
In addition, funds are provided to finance two other
components related to the general objective of
improved water management in India: (a) support for
Induction Training of Engineers in Maharashtra; and,
(b) an Institutional Strengthening and Training Fund
to be managed by GOI id state agencies.
The main element of the project will be implemented
over a seven-year period; the Maharashtra Induction
Training Program will be completed in five years; and
the Institutional Strengthening and Training Fund
would be fully expended in two years.
The risks of the project stem mainly from the dif-
ficulties of changing management patterns in existing
irrigated areas and the shortage of experienced water
management specialists.

Staff Appraisal Report
I. BACKGROUND
Agriculture and Irrigation in India
1.01    India has a population of about 800 M (mid-105), which is growing at
an annual rate of about 2.2Z. Since 196G, per capita income has risen 1.2%
per year, and in 1984/85 was close to Rs 3,420 (US$265). Although average
incomes have increased, and access to public services has improved, about 25Z
of the population continues to live in conditions of absolute poverty. Most
of the poor are in rural areas and depend on agriculture for a living.
1.02    Agriculture continues to be the dominant sector of the Indian
economy, contributing about 36% of GNP and engaging almost 70% of the total
labor force. Foodgrain production accelerated substantially during the 1960s
as a result of the green revolution and the introduction of high-yielding
varieties of wheat and rice. During the Fifth (1974-79) and Sixth (1979-84)
Plan periods, output has continued to increase by about 2.7% per year. About
60% of this increase can be attributed to greater yields, and the balance
mainly to increased double cropping. Growth in wheat output (5.5% p.a.)
reflects the outstanding performance of the Northwest States (Punjab,
Haryana, Western UP). In contrast, rice production has increased by only
2.0% p.a. owing to the poor performnance of the Eastern States, and coarse
grains have climbed only (1.5% p.a.) because of limited increases under
rainfed conditions. However, the rising and more stable foodgrain output
enabled India to withstand the adverse conditions created by monsoons in both
1979 and 1983, whereas serious disruptions were caused by only marginally
more severe conditions in 1964 and 1966. The rising output of foodgrains has
been accompanied by some diversification into higher-value cash crops (sugar-
cane, cotton, etc.). At the same time, production of oil seeds and pulses
has failed to keep up with demand.
1.(3    Since 1947, irrigation potential has risen from 19.5 M ha to 61.5 M
ha (1983/84), with 93% of the potential estimated to be utilized. 1/ Sixth
Plan achievements fell short of targets, but potential still rose at 2.25 M

for 9.8X of plan outlays in comparison with a target of 11.6%. Ultimate
potentias has been estimated at 113.5 M ha, 1/ or 60% of the cultivated area.
1.04    This expandion has conti.Ltu cf a steady growth in major and medium
surface irrigation; rapid growth in (mainly private) groundwater developmen.t,
which now accounts for about 402 of the irrigated area; and, more recently,
some growth in minor surface irrigation. Development remains regionally
concentrated, with four States (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, and Andhra
Pradesh) accounting for more than 50% of the irrigated area. rhe exploited
potential ranges from only 30% in Madhya Pradesh to more than 80% in Punjab
ard Tamil Nadu. The groundwater (40 M ha) and surface potential (73 M ha) is
expected to be fully developed early in the next century.
1.05    This increased irrigation accounts in large part for the improvement
in agricultural performance. Irrigation has not only increased the area
cropped and reduced crop losses in areas of inadequate rainfall, but it has
also reduced the risks associated with rainfed farming, and thus encouraged
diversified cropping, the use of HYV seeds, and the use of expensive inputs.
Irrigated land, which constitutes only one-third of the cropped area,
receives 85% of the fertilizer used.
Bank Involvement in the Sector 2/
1.06    Over the past 25 years, IDA has supported 43 irrigation projects
through credits and loans amounting to $3,800 M. Of this amount, 61% went to
the development of new schemes; 27% went to mcuernization or rehabilitation
works; and the residual 12% was used to support schemes (for example, the
replacement of barrages) that did not increase the irrigated area. Public
groundwater development was a major component in four credits (Haryana II,
Cr. 1319-IN, UP Public Tubewells I & II, Cr. 1004-IN, Cr. 1332-IN, and Bihar
Public Tubewells Cr. 1737-IN). In addition, private groundwater exploitation
has been extensively financed under agricultural credit programs (ARDC I, II
and III, Cr. 540, 715, 947-IN) and the current NABARD (Ln. 2653-IN). Nine
project PCRs and PPARs have been completed.
1.07    The basic thrust of Bank involvement in the sector has always been to
increase the area irrigated, to ensure that the system is capable of serving
the users, and to improve planning, design, and construction methods.
However, the emphasis given to specific components of irrigation investments
has varied. In the early 1970s, for example, attention was focused on the
systems below the Government outlet--often up to 100 ha in size--which were
supposed to be developed by the farmers. However, may of these systems
lacked the necessary channels to distribute water to individual farms and
plots. When experience with existing systems demonstrated that the standard

Ganges-Brahmaputra to the South and West, estimated by the "National
Perspective Plan for Water Resources Development" to be another 35 M ha.

previous operations in the three participating states (Andhra Pradesh,
Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu).



-3-
design assumptions regarding seepage losses were grossly optimistic, lengthy
discussions took place with GOI and the States concerned and considerable
data were collected on this problem. The solution adopted in Bank-financed
projects was to provide for the lining of all channels, with the proviso that
lining would be omitted wherever analysis showed it to be uneconomical. In
additicn, following unsuccessful attempts to encourage farmers to construct
watercourses at their own expense, but with the support of institutional
credit, OI made it national policy to have channels to turnouts serving
areas of about 8 ha constructed at project expense.
1.08    Lending for irrigation has expanded very rapidly in the past 10 years
and has supported several pioneering initiatives that have both enhanced the
Bank's relationship with India and brought about institutional improvements
within the country. For example, financing was extended to large "composite"
projects, including three or four separately appraised major subprojects.
Also financed in several States, were line-of-credit projects under which
smaller subprojects were appraised according to criteria agreed by Project
Preparation Cells in GOI and the States. At the same time, independent Dam
Safety Review Panels, composed of Indian experts, were set up to oversee
design and construction of dams. In separate initiative related to training
of irrigation staff, Training Institutes in seven states were established for
the express purpose of upgrading design and operation standards, especially
of the minor systems. Research and Development components were included in
some projects, which together with the Project Preparation Funds provided
under two projects gave the Statesr GOI, and the Bank the means to address
particular problems as they arose. In addition, a UNDP Project supported the
use of foreign consultants to assist in establishing the WALMIs, to initiate
pilot water management efforts, and to assist in other specialist tasks,
including the production of guidelines for the design and operation of
irrigation systems. At the project level, the most important technical
innovation was the entirely new system of public tubewell irrigation intro-
duced into UP.
1.09    Most recently, special attention has been given to two efforts in the
irrigation sector. One was the preparation of projects on th.e Narmada River,
which is the site of the largest irrigation scheme in India, and perhaps in
the world. By becoming involved at the stage when fundamentai decisions were
being made regarding water allocation among farmers, the physical structures
required, the rules for system operation, the construction techniques for the
project, and the handling of environmental and resettlement issues, the Bank
was able to encourage GOI to improve all of these elements to standards
previously unkrnown in India--and to consider institutional reforms, which are
of at least equal importance. Second, special emphasis has been put on
improving the operation of existing systems, which has been the primary
concern in the formulation of this project.

II. PERFORMANCE AND POTENTIAL OF EXISTING IRRIGATION SYSTEMS
Irrigation Management Systems in India
2.01    Agroclimatic and socioeconomic conditions in India vary widely, and
the irrigation systems that have evclved reflect this diversity, both in state
policy and in individual schemes. Most surface systems can be classified into
four main types: localization, warabundi, shejpali, and field-field.
2.02    Localization.  In the southern states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and
Tamil Nadu) where rice is generally the preferred crop, irrigation is tradi-
tionally synonymous with paddy cultivation. "Localization" represents an
attempt to limit the area under paddy and extend the irrigated area by desig-
nating certain areas for "irrigated wet" (IW) crops such as paddy and sugar-
cane, and others for "irrigated dry" (ID) or upland crops. Furthermore, to
spread the benefits of irrigation as widely as possible, large areas were only
partly served ("nonlocalized") even though they could be commanded by the
system. The combined cropping pattern, whih was based on computed crop
requirements and assumed operational efficiencies, was designed to coincide
with the available water supply. To minimize capital costs and management
problems, continuous supply was provided down to the Government outlet, the
design duty for IW areas (1.80-1.20 1/s/ha, 40-60 acres per cusec) being about
twice that for ID areas (0.72-0.60 1/s/ha, 100-120 acres per cusec). To make
the best use of available resources, IW crops were in theory limited to
low-lying areas with heavy soil, which naturally collected runoff, and ID crops
were to be grown in higher areas, where soils were lighter. In practice, this
was not always possible and other considerations frequently intervened (e.g.,
each village needed some area for subsistence paddy).
2.03    In theory, localization has merit, but it will not work unless ID
farmers and nonlocalized farmers in the upper reaches are willing to abide by
the localization pattern even though continuous and substantial flows for paddy
are being passed through the system. 1/ Their unwillingness to do so has led to
a breakdown of the localization distinction. The physical infrastructure is
seen by the farmers as hindering irrigation in upstream ID and nonlocalized
areas, and as inadequate in the lower reaches as upstream demand absorbs the
available supply, a problem exacerbated by gross underestimation of seepage
losses in the canal designs. In consequence, control structures are "modified"
by the farmers, and no serious attempt has been made to formulate the rules and
responsibilities. Instead, an ongoing struggle has developed between the
farmers and the authorities, the scale of which makes it difficult to take
action against offenders.
2.04    Furthermore, with abundant water during the early years of project
operation, "temporary" conversions to IW were often allowed. Indeed, during
the food crises of the late 1960s such conversions were encouraged, and it has
subsequently been difficult to persuade farmers to revert back to ID crops.
1/ Even in ID areas, continuous flow to the Government outlet means that upper
reach farmers along a distributary or minor, or within a water course com-
mand, can support paddy at the expense of those lower down.



-5-
Farmers have resisted such a change on the grounds that their fields were now
levelled and prepared for paddy. (In some cases the whole local economy became
geared to the conversion when a sugar mill was constructed.) Even where some
farmers have welcomed a change to higher value, if more risky crops, the high
water table induced by IW crops may discourage them from doing so.
2.05    The predominant pattern of irrigation in schemes designed for localiza-
tion has thus been a concentration of paddy irrigation in the head reaches of
canals; an intermediate or fringe area where farmers struggle to grow paddy or
resort to ID crops in response to an unreliable supply; and tail reaches which
are essentially planted to rainfed ID crops, with perhaps the occasional
erratic irrigation, except where natural runoff allows for paddy cultivation.
The spread of insecurity down the system is of considerable significance in
relation to paddy. Rice is grown in stages, first in a nursery, which requires
a lot of water over a small area, followed by transplanting into a puddled
field, which requires a lot of water over a large area, and then by the growing
period which requires continuous supply at a somewhat reduced rate. Where
access to water is uncertain because the upper farmers control the supply, the
timing of transplanting becomes uncertain. Since modern high-yielding, short
duration rice varieties are very sensitive to the date of transplanting,
risk-averse farmers instead plant long-duration varieties. The result is a
patchwork of early planted, short duration varieties, and late planted, long
duration crops. To serve the needs of both it is not uncommon that the Irriga-
tion Department must run all the canals continuously for over seven months,
leaving very little water for the rabi season.
2.06    Warabundi.  The northwestern States of Punjab, Haryana, and parts of
UP and Rajasthan operate the warabundi 1/ system. This system is based on a
clear objective: to distribute available water as equitably and as reliably as
possible. In principle water is allocated in proportion to land and the right
to water goes with the land. The system was developed to meet the needs of
water-short, river diversion projects, where the supply was both limited and
erratic. It was clear that strong management would be needed to avoid the
pressures from individual farmers trying to draw more than their share, and
that the system should be transparently fair to users. It has survived intact
as water has become more reliable and marginally more plentiful because of the
construction of dams.
2.07    The strengths of the system are easily identified.  The infrastructure
is sized so that the capacity of successive channels is proportional to the
area served, thus running a channel full will automatically provide the
"proper" share of water to its command, and the sub-channels it serves will
also automatically run full without adjustment of gates, or other interventions
at lower levels in the system. The rules are also directly related to the
management plan: irrigation schedules are drawn up and published, so that each
farmer knows when water is expected to be provided; in addition priorities are
1/ Warabundi is in fact the system of operation below the Government outlet,
while a separately defined rotational system governs operation above the
outlet. However, the combined system is commonly referred to as warabundi.
Warabundi requires rotational supply but the provision of a rotational
supply does not ensure warabundi.



-6-
assigned to sub-commands on a rotating basis, so that, if water is unexpectedly
short, the order in which commands will be closed is known. Finally, within
this framework, the responsibilities of the authorities and the farmers are
defined. The Irrigation Department's job is relatively simple; they must
ensure that the channels run full according to the schedules and priorities
agreed. The ease with which this can be accomplished is, of course, strongly
related to the fact that the infrastructure is specifically designed to suit
the operational rules. The farmers' responsibilities and rights are also
clearly defined; each farmer is entitled to draw the entire amount of water
running in the watercourse in accordance with a schedule which divides the
entire week into a series of turns, proportional in duration to the area of
each holding.
2.08    Three other advantages of warabundi metit attention.  First, each
farmer has an incentive to use water efficiently because his share is limited,
usually insufficient to irrigate his entire holdings, and thus has a high
opportunity cost. Limited surface supplies also provide a powerful incentive
for groundwater development which has become a very important factor in many
areas. Second, the discipline set out in the rules of operation benefits all
the farmers, creating a built-in robustness and stability to the system without
the necessity for complex cooperation among the farmers. Third, the system's
simplicity allows the farmers to monitor allocations.
2.09    While its strengths have ensured the success of warabundi, the system
is not without its weaknesses. It is for instance not easy to accommodate
crops with highly variable water requirements. In fresh groundwater areas,
this can be offset by conjunctive use, but in saline areas cropping patterns
may be constrained. Another problem relates to canal rotation practices in
response to variable supplies. While in principle priorities are equitable and
known, in practice operational problems relating to variable supply can lead to
significant inequities between head and tail cormnands.
2.10    Shejpali.  Cujarat and Maharashtra operate a demand system called
shejpali, under which the farmers apply each season for permission to irrigate
a particular cropping pattern. Applications are considered by committees at
the project, command and distributary level. Sanctions are granted on the
basis of water availability, channel capacities, and some attempt Vo avoid
isolated patches of irrigation which are difficult to serve. Once sanction is
granted, the farmer is authorized to draw water to irrigate the agreed cropping
pattern, and the Irrigation Department is obliged to supply water. The
infrastructure provided for operating the shejpali system is designed to allow
much more flexible operation than is provided for in warabundi systems.
Because the cropping pattern to be served is not known at the design stage, the
channels and outlets are oversized for normal operation to allow for peaks.
Many gates are provided to allow differential rates of supply to every outlet
command (thus, in contrast to the warabundi system, low-level intervention into
the running of the system is expected and provided for). The rules of opera-
tion tend to define objectives rather than lay a basis for system operation;
thus the Irrigation Department is responsible for supplying the "reasonable"
needs of the sanctioned cropping pattern, while the farmers must not "waste"
water, and must level their field "adequately". Operationally meaningful
responsibilities are difficult to specify under these circumstances.



-7-
2.11    In an attempt to remedy these problems, a system called "rigid
shejpali" is being introduced. Under this system, the sanctioned cropping
pattern is made the basis for fixing schedules which are then to be strictly
adhered to. Initial effects are positive: reliability improves, tailends are
better served, and farmers are encouraged to grow higher value crops. The
problem, however, is that the system design requires that the channels be run
at varying levels depending on demand. This causes the discharges at the
outlets to vary, making irrigation management difficult, and farmers often
claim that their proper turns have not been fully provided. While the system
is operating below full capacity, the slack can be used to "make up" local
deficiencies. At peak demand, the system will be most difficult to operate and
will have no slack, a combination that can create instability.
2.12    Field-Field.  The fourth major system of irrigation in India is the
traditional field-to-field irrigation practiced in the old, rice-intensive
schemes, notably in the southern and eastern deltas. In complete contrast to
the warabundi system, where intermittent flows are divided between farmers on
the basis of time, field-to-field irrigation is based on continuous flows,
divided into ever smaller streams, to the individual plot. Ad-hoc rotational
supply is practiced for the land preparation phase. These systems have
developed over many years and rely for their often considerable success on
close, informal cooperation between farmers. Many of the modern barrage
schemes have incorporated hundreds of age-old tank systems which complicate the
management of the scheme. Few general remarks can be made about the
infrastructure because it is largely the product of evolution rather than
design. Similarly, the rules and responsibilities have developed to suit local
circumstances.
2.13    Influence of the System on Irrigation Allocation.  An important charac-
teristic of the warabundi system is that it is a supply-based operation, under
which the Irrigation Department follows clearly defined rules to distribute the
available water as reliably and as equitably as possible. In this system, the
farmer plants his crops and arranges his other agricultural activities to fit a
pattern of water supply which, while not absolutely guaranteed, is nevertheless
quite predictable. The general pattern of supply may be designed to match the
general pattern of demand, for example, by giving consecutive weeks of flow
during the wheat planting period, but the Irrigation Department is not obliged
to attempt an exact match.
2.14    The other systems, especially shejpali and localization, are demand
oriented, being based in theory at least on crop needs. Experience shows that
it is often impossible to meet the complexities of individual farmer's demands
with the infrastructure available. In times of high demand, the process, at
best, becomes crisis management, reliability suffers, and most farmers even-
tually adopt low-yield, risk-minimizing cropping patterns.



Recent Initiatives and E periences
2.15    Formal approaches to system management problems have been outlined in
various GOI reviews and proposals: 1/ among such approaches are the pilot
program in rotational water supply in Sriramasagar (Pochampad-Andhra Pradesh)
and another in Mahi Kadana (Gujarat) which led to proposals for Bank-supported
RWS projects in both Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh 2/, and the findings of the
Commission for Irrigation Utilization in Andhra Pradesh. 3/ The pilot program
in Sriramsagar initially hai a significant impact on agricultural production,
4/ but was located in areas with secure supplies to the Government outlet, and
focused on farmer involvement and rotation below the outlet. The expectation
was that farmers' organizations would create pressure to improve system manage-
ment. However, the program had only a limited effect on the operation of the
system as a whole, 5/ and when support for farmer organizations weakened, the
program became ineffective.  With the support of the Commission, however, the
experience at Sriramasagar led the GOAP to adopt the "Integrated Water Manage-
ment Program" under which canals are closed systematically one or two days a
week to reduce water use and force water to tail-end areas (systematic canal
operation), and detailed time-based rotation is introduced below the Government
outlet (warabundi). This program has been widely adopted in AP schemes, and
systematic canal operation in particular has had a significant impact. 6/ The
introduction of warabundi (based on experience in Northwest India (para 2.06))
has been supported by a GOI centrally sponsored CAD program but has had mixed
results, particularly in paddy areas (where it is difficult to maintain the
channels below the outlet during the kharif seasor) and where main system
supplies remain unreliable.
2.16    The RWS projects proposed for Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka were out-
lined in a 1982 GOI proposal for a rotational water supply project (para 3.11).
The objectives of all three proposals were welcomed by the Bank but their

management of individual schemes. This initiative led to some improve-
ments, but there was little systematic follow-up.

-9-
feasibility, phasing and institutional requirements were questioned. There-
fore, as a first step, Bank staff were asked to pursue water management issues
more actively in ongoing Bank-supported projects. In particular, they helped
initiate programs in three widely differing schemes, two in South India (Nagar-
junasagar in Andhra Pradesh and Upper Krishna in Karnataka) and one in Gujarat
(Dantiwada):
(a) Nagarjunasagar (900,000 ha) is a massive localized scheme for mixed
paddy and ID crops (para 2.02). Building on the earlier Integrated
Water Management Program (para 2.15), GOI in 1984/85 introduced an
approach--which was expanded in 1985/86--that added a number of fea-
tures, particularly in the area of reservoir operations (carryover for
a guaranteed early start to the following kharif season), water budget-
ing, intermittent supply for ID crops, and the timing and completion of
cropping activities. Despite initial teething problems, the program
has been successful and is to be expanded further in 1986/87. The area
under irrigation expanded significantly faster than water use (in
1985/86, the irrigated area was 68% higher than in 1983/84, whereas
water use rose only 17.5%) 1/; there was a major shift to ID crops
(from 30% of the area irrigated to 46%); yields of paddy in the 360,000
ha of the early sown water management zone rose markedly above past
levels (4.75-5.5 t/ha compared to 3.5- 4.5 t/ha); 2/ and there was a
large increase in the area of pulses grown on residual moisture (from
about 20% to 37% of the paddy area). Unfortunately, a serious pest
attack (which spread throughout the region) reduced the yields of
cotton, the major ID crop; however, this reduction cannot be attributed
to the water management program. Although other factors may have
contributed to some of the favorable results (e.g., changes in the
relative profitability of crops) and a partial switch back to paddy
has occurred this year, in general, the program achieved its major
objectives.
(b) Upper Krishna is a major new project still in the early stages of
development. In operating plan initially proposed, rotation of
irrigated areas with the command was such that in any one year a third
of the area would be under kharif crops, a third under rabi, and a
third under two seasonal crops, and these areas were to rotate year by
year. Although such an approach might improve equity, in comparison
with "localization" based on fixed areas, it would still have most of
the drawbacks of traditional practice (para 2.02). Hence, an alterna-
tive system was adopted, which was similar in many respects to the
Northwest system (para 2.06) and is based on the allocation of
pre-determined supplies in proportion to the irrigable area. Dis-
tributary canals are run full or not at all; an irrigation schedule is
followed--it is announced clearly in advance and consistent with
general crop needs; warabundi schedules are introduced below the out-
let; and ungated distribution systems are being constructed. Although
1/ Large areas on the Left Bank were brought under irrigation for the first
time and benefited from the improved operations.
2/ Lowest and highest average yield oy Taluka.



-10-
it is impossible to compare what would have occurred with the original
proposals, the schedules have been generally followed and farmer
response has been favorable.
(c) Dantiwada Irrigation Scheme (45,000 ha) is being modernized under the
Gujarat Medium II Project (Cr.1496-IN). 1/ As elsewhere in Gujarat
and Maharashtra, it was operated according to the shejpali system of
crop sanctions under which farmers apply for irrigation on a seasonal,
annual or longer-term basis (para 2.10). To counter the problems
associated with this system, a warabundi program was initiated in 1984
under which all farmers receive a share based on area; delivery
schedules are predetermined (allowing in rabi for carryover); outlet
capacities are adjusted in proportion to the area served; and warabundi
schedules are introduced below the outlet. While drought severely
curtailed rabi cultivation during 1985/86, evidence from the previous
year suggested a 29% increasc in cropping over the control area com-
bined with a 15% savings in water use. Significant yield benefits were
also claimed. Given these results, the program has been continued and
guidelines based on this experience have been issued by COG to assist
operations in other schemes in the state.
2.17    Initial experience with these three programs and two others (Hula in
Maharashtra and the Rajasthan Canal) was reviewed in a report issued in October
1984, and in more recent reports on Nagarjunasagar and Dantiwada. 2/ In addi-
tion to these programs, many other initiatives have been taken both in
Bank-supported and other programs. These include programs in shejpali systems,
e.g., in Mula, where emphasis has been given to mobilizing farmer involvement,
in Jayakwadi, where long experience with the pilot and farmers' projects has
led to programs supported under the Maharashtra Water Utilization (Cr.1383-IN)
and Maharashtra III (Cr.1621-IN) Projects; and in Mahi where promising results
have been obtained from a USAID-supported operational research program; in
northwest warabundi systems, e.g., pilot programs in Haryana (Cr.1319-IN) and
Rajasthan (IFAD Ln. 32-IN) which have shown the agricultural impact of provid-
ing farmers with predetermined fixed schedules, and overall scheduling models
for Haryana and Punjab which show promise for making the system as a whole more
responsive to local requirements); 3/ and in southern systems, e.g., in Periyar
Vaigai where programs have shown promise for improving scheduling of supplies
and integrating tanks, and in the Cauvery Delta and Thambaraparani where
reduced supplies and rotational issues had a significant impact on yields in
1985/86.

-11-
Past Experience as a Guideline for Future Planning
2.18    Several important conclusions can be drawn from these experiences and
from more general experience from schemes in India. First, it is not possible
to provide service to individual farmers and plots with the infrastructure
available in most surface irrigation schemes in India. Consequently, at some
level in the system, control must be transferred to the farmers. Second,
farmers cannot organize to perform their role in the distribution of water if
the supplies they receive are unreliable. Third, reliable supplies can only be
assured if the operational plan is realistically framed in relation to the
available infrastructure. Ideally, each farmer would receive his allotted
share of water on a predetermined schedule, allowing him to plan his operations
with minimum uncertainty. In many schemes, this standard is a long-term objec-
tive, which can be reached over t:me through successive rounds of infrastruc-
tural and operational improvements.
2.19    Deciding on how to intervene in any particular case is neither simple
nor easy given the large number of parameters that describe a given irrigation
system and its operations. Any interventions must reflect an understanding of
how the system presently operates and why it has evolved as it has. They must
be responsive to the established socio-economic environment and to evolving
agricultural conditions, and be realistically framed in relation to the avail-
able infrastructure. They must also be consistent with long-term objectives
for the scheme and the river basin concerned.
2.20    A fundamental consideration relates to the water supply.  Not only may
it differ from design expectations but it changes in relation to the irrigated
area as the scheme and river basin develop and can vary enormously from year to
year. Furthermore, canal supplies are only a part of the total water avail-
able. Operating practice has often evolved to suit the convenience of canal
management rather than to make best use of all the resources available (rain-
fall, groundwater, tanks, and re-use systems, etc., as well as canal supplies).
A re-evaluation of the water resource is therefore an essential first step,
and, taken in association with evolving agricultural requirements, may suggest
changes in the rules governing reservoir operations, in the ways that water
rights are satisfied or in water distribution practices. While groundwater
development would not be specifically funded under the project, conjunctive use
by privately developed shallow wells does provide flexibility and improves the
efficiency of many projects.
2.21    The modifications to be introduced must respond to the dominant crop
mix, how this is changing and the extent to which operational practice can
encourage further desirable changes. An agricultural plan consistent with the
available water resource must therefore be prepared with an operational plan
for water delivery to meet the revised agricultural objectives. Where rice
predominates, the priority needs are usually to support early nursery estab-
lishment (in order to encourage short duration HYVs, maximize use of rainfall
and ensure early completion of the kharif crop) and to coordinate transplanting
on a block-by-block basis (so that water is not wasted in the process of serv-
ing scattered areas of late-planted crops and to allow an even and early start
to the rabi crop). For upland crops, the priority may also be to guarantee the
timing of the kharif crop, while during rabi a supply based system, such as
that practiced in the Northwest (para 2.06), has much to offer since it allows



-12-
the responsibilities of the Irrigation Department to be clearly and realisti-
cally defined. The level of the system to which the scheduling is fixed must
be carefully related to the infrastructure available since, if the plan is over
ambitious in relation to this infrastructure, the prospects for involving the
farmers in further improvement will be limited. Among the most problematic
schemes are those with mixed paddy and upland crops. Often under these condi-
tions, interventions will seek to limit paddy to low-lying areas through
supply-based scheduling practices coupled with special paddy issues, for
example, to tanks. In other cases, this may not be possible and more complex
operations may be inevitable. A common situation in high rainfall areas is a
paddy/upland crop rotation where the problem is to distribute limited rabi
supplies through an irrigation system designed for paddy (which consequently
may have few control structures, limited field channels and higher channel
capacities than needed for upland crops).
2.22    The operational plan defines the water delivery service to be provided
to the farmers. It must be acceptable to them, and can only be finalized
following discussions with them and the approval of the scheme's managing board
or committee. To ensure its implementation, responsibilities have to be
assigned, other supporting services, input supply, extension, etc., have to be
programmed to meet its requirements, and farmers must be fully informed of what
to expect. Available financial resources need to be expanded in support of the
operational plan. If these are restricted to normal O&M allocations, the plan
will have to be related to the existing infrastructure, maintained as far as
possible to meet its requirements. Where additional resources are provided (as
proposed under the NWMP), the plan can be modified, supported by enhanced 0&M
allocations and scheme investments designed to upgrade the system for better
management. If substantial additional resources are available, a major modern-
ization of the system may be desirable, possibly accompanied by a radical
change in the operational plan. Whatever interventions are proposed, satisfac-
tory arrangements must be made for monitoring and evaluation so that the plan
can be modified in subsequent years to reflect the successes and failures of
prior experience.
2.23    Each scheme is different, and the operational interventions that are
appropriate will vary widely. Most non-rice areas will adopt a rotational
regime. In rice areas, rotation is commonly used in the land preparation
phase, which requires very high rates of application, followed by continuous
flow in the growing phase. Nevertheless, the above suggests that there is
sufficient practical evidence to support a systematic approach to operational
planning, and that the process is similar for all schemes. Guidelines for
preparing such a plan are included in Annex 4, and the proposed project would
seek to initiate such an approach in selected states and schemes. Annexes 5,
6, and 7 of SDVI summarize proposals for three demonstration schemes to
illustrate the application of appropriate technology.
Rationale for Bank involvement
2.24    Improving the productivity of existing irrigation investments is a
primary sectoral objective of both the Bank and GOI. Although irrigation has
contributed greatly to India's success in increasing foodgrain production over
the past 20 years, the returns to the investment made have been lower than they
would have been if water management had been given adequate attention.



-13-
2.25    Improved management of irrigation projects depends fundamentally on
initiatives by the field staff who plan, direct, and execute canal system
operations. But outside agencies, such as the Bank or the central govern-
ment, can have an important and sometimes essential catalytic role in, the
process. 1/ First, the process of defining the plan of operation promotes
constructive questioning of traditional norms and practices; second, it
provides a forum where new ideas--often provided by the existing staff--can
legitimately be discussed with senior officers; third, the outside agency can
often bring proven ideas from other states, or identify approaches that have
already failed elsewhete; finally, by formalizing these activities into a
project, with institutional linkages to the state and central governments,
the importance and benefits of improved canal operation.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin, Scope and Objectives
Project Origin
3.01    GOI first approached the Bank with a proposal for a national water
management project in 1982. 2/ Its objectives were supported by the Bank but
questions were raised concerning its feasibility, phasing and institutional
requirements. As a first step, therefore, Bank staff were assigned to pursue
water management issues more actively under ongoing Bank-supported projects
and, in particular, help initiate the three programs reviewed in Chapter II
(para 2.16). Given the encouraging results, and the other evidence reviewed
above, GOI in late 1984 established a Water Management Cell (WMC) in the
Ministry of Irrigation (now Water Resources), and the Bank and GOI together
agreed to explore the potential for a water management project in selected
States. Guidelines for preparing scheme proposals were developed, 3/ and a
joint GOI/Bank team helped prepare three "model" proposals.
3.02    These proposals met with a favorable State response, and in April
1985, GOI decided to initiate detailed preparation in three states (Andhra
Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu). 4/ If the concept was successful, other
states were to be included at a subsequent stage. Assisted by the joint
GOI/Bank team, each of these States prepared an overall project report,
finalized a detailed scheme proposal and began preparation for a number of
other schemes (see para 3.32).
1/ See in particular the extensive appraisal reports for the Narmada program
in Gujarat.
2/ GOI: "National Program on Rotational Water Supply System" (Draft for
Discussions with the World Bank), 11 April 1982.
3/ See Annex 4: "Guidelines for Preparing a Scheme Proposal".
4/ See Annex 3 for background information on these three States.



-14-
Project Objectives and Scope
3.03    Objectives.  The purpose of the project is to increase productivity
and farm incomes in existing irrigation schemes through a more reliable,
predictable, and equitable irrigation service. To achieve these objectives
and facilitate extensien of similar activities throughout the country, the
project would help participating States and OI develop an institutional
capacity to plan, implement, and monitor improved O&M practices, and would
provide for selected schemes for low-cost infrastructural improvements
designed to support an improved operational plan. In each case, the most
appropriate technique of water supply would be adopted.
3.04    Scope.  Sixteen schemes have been identified by the participating
states. They command about 1.68 M ha, of which 0.46 M ha would be included
in the improvement programs to be financed under the project. Provision
would also be made for a further 0.12 M ha in schemes yet to be identified;
these would be divided about equally between the participating States and
pilot programs in other States. Thus, the project is expected to cover about
0.58 M ha directly (Table 7).
3.05    Scheme Formulation.  The most important element of scheme formulation
is the preparation of an operational plan. On the basis of water
availability, system characteristics, and agricultural options, the plan
defines how the system would be operated with respect to the timings and
quanUities of water deliveries and the responsibilities of those involved
(paras. 2.18-2.23). The basic elements of and procedures for formulating an
operational plan are presented in Annex 4.  Required staffing, budget, and
facilities for O&M would form part of the plan, which would also program the
scheme investments to be supported by the project.
B. Detailed Features
Summary of Project Components
3.06    The principal components of the main part of the project (improved
water management) would be:
(a) Scheme Investments required to implement the operational plan. These
would include repairs and renovations to existing structures; provi-
sion of new control structures; field channels and drains; measuring
devices; and investments in upgraded O&M facilities and equipment,
including housing for staff and transport and communications equip-
ment, as required to execute the operational plan.
(b) Engineering and Administration required to supervise the effective
implementation of the scheme investments.
(c)  Incremental Recurrent O&M Expenditures to support the improved opera-
tional plan and maintain it after the completion of the scheme
investments.
(d) Institutional Strengthening of the State Irrigation Departments, with
particular emphasis on helping them develop O&M planning and support
units in the states. In addition, the project will strengthen the



-15-
Water Management Cell (WMC) in the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR)
so that it can provide policy direction, act as a catalyst for
extending the approach across state boundaries, and administer and
coordinate the NWMP as a whole. In each case, the project would
support staffing costs, buildings, equipment, vehicles, and
associated recurrent costs.
(e) Training Programs. At the scheme level, an orientation training
schedule for field staff and farmers would be defined as part of the
scheme proposal; the project would also provide support for technical
and orientation training programs for scheme staff, State O&M staff,
and staff of the WMC. Study tours within India and limited overseas
visits would be provided for, along with support for the infrastruc-
tural development of the Irrigation Management and Training Institute
in Tamil Nadu.
(f) Special Studies and Programs. Provision would be made for
consultancy services and for other assistance designed to strengthen
specific aspects of water management (e.g. monitoring and evaluation,
computer applications, communications, dam safety, etc.).
3.07    The project would support two other components related to the general
objectives of improved water management in India:
(a) The Maharashtra Induction Training Program, which will support ini-
tial vocational training for engineers recruited to the Maharashtra
Irrigation Department; and
(b)  An Institutional Strengthening and Training Fund (ISTF) to be managed
and implemented by GOI and state agencies along the lines of two
previous Project Preparation Ft'nds.
Improved Water Management Components
3.08    Scheme Investments.  The physical investments proposed for the scheme
improvement component of the NWMP (about 80% of the cost) would cover
deferred maintenance, corrective additions required to implement the opera-
tional plan, and enhanced O&M facilities and equipment. On the basis of the
cost estimates for 10 schemes involving some 390,000 ha (62.5% of the total
area to be covered under the project), the upper limit for scheme investments
has been set at Rs 2,500/ha. This figure is low enough to ensure that the
approach can be replicated and that attention will be concentrated on the
highest-priority investments. In cases where the State decides to invest in
more intensive rehabilitation, project disbursements would be limited to
investments of up to Rs 2,500/ha at 1986 prices, including physical contin-
gencies. The composition of scheme investments is illustrated in the three
schemes outlined in the following table:

3.09    Incremental O&M.  A detailed O&M plan will be prepared for each
scheme and included in the scheme proposal. This plan will specify the
actual O&M funds required year by year to manage the schemes effectively and
efficiently. A clear distinction will be made between:
(a) recurrent expenditures required to implement the operational plan,
principally staff at both the engineer (officer) and nonprofessional
(work supervisor, laskar, support staff) levels and associated recur-
rent expenditures (such as, transport and utilities). To the extent
consistent with the requirements of the operational plan, staff
increases will be kept to a minimum--for example, through reassign-
ment or retraining of existing personnel--so that the past erosion in
the share of maintenance in the total will be reversed; and
(b) maintenance expenditures required to maintain the physical
infrastructure.
Agreement has been reached with the GOAP, GOK, and GOTN that they would, for
all NWMP schemes, provide the O&M requirements as defined in the scheme
reports and which would be satisfactory to GOI and IDA (paras 5.08-5.09).
3.10    Provision has been made under the project for scheme specific incre-
ments in the O&M amount in excess of the average of the three years prior to
the first year in which O&M support is provided. Typical analyses are given
in Annexes 5, 6, and 7 in SDV I, which can be summarized as follows:
Subproject                      Current       Pro osed    Incremental

-17-
These requirements (expressed in 1986 prices) and analyses of other schemes
indicate that incremental O&M would be about Rs 80/ha. This figure has been
included in the cost estimates, phased as follows: Rs 40/ha in the first year
in which incremental expenditures are provided, Rs 60/ha in the second year,
and Rs 80/ha in the third year and subsequent years. The year in which
incremental O&M will start will be defined in the scheme report; for purposes
of estimation this has been assLmed to be the third year of each scheme
programe
3.11    Institutional Strengthening.  Project Preparation Cells (PPCs) will
prepare schemes with the assistance of scheme staff and other State agencies.
The specific organizational arrangements will vary from State to State.  In
each case, the incremental costs related to planning and management arrange-
ments would be financed under the project, and would include:
(a) staffing (engineers, surveyors, draftsmen, supporting staff, etc);
(b) materials and equipment;
(c) technical assistance from other agencies (e.g. groundwater); and
(d) associated recurrent costs.
Not only will the PPC itself be strengthend, but arrangements have been made
to strengthen the units undertaking detailed survey and design work. In
Andhra Pradesh, subdivisions have been establi! ed under the State Central
Design Organization on secondment to the PPC; in Karnataka, staff are to be
reallocated within the existing regional organizations (which are generally
responsible for most survey and design work); and in Tamil Nadu, subdivisions
have been established under the PPC itself. In addition to preparing
schemes, the PPCs would manage the implementation of the NWMP. They would
monitor project progress, report to GOI and the Bank, and maintain project
accounts. A Project Accounting Unit (PAU) would be established in each PPC
to handle these project accounts, as well as requests for financial provi-
sions and collation of expenditures for reimbursement from IDA.
3.12    State O&M Cells.  The project would strengthen the capacity of the
State Irrigation Departments to provide OM policy, planning, and implementa-
tion support. In each participating state, an O&M cell would be established
to assist in:
(a) the overall direction of State O&M activities; and
(b) the planning, implementation, and monitoring ot scheme-level OEM
programs.
The relationship between these units and the PPCs would differ from State to
State and evolve over time (para 5.04). Their responsibilities and the
specific arrangements in each State are described in SDV I, Annex 8.
3.13    Charts 1-3 show how the PPCs and O&M Units would be placed in the
various State organizations. Tables 8, 9, and 10 show their estimated staff-
ing levels and costs.



-18-
3.14    The GOI Water Management Cell (WMC) in the MWR was established in
late 1984 to help prepare and promote the NWMP. Its technical staff (cur-
rently comprising one Chief Engineer (WM) and one Joint Commissioner (WM))
would be expanded under the the project, and would be provided with
appropriate support staff, transport, office and dra'lting equipment. Table
11 shows the estimated costs of the WMC.
3.15    Training.  Training would be an integral part of the project and
crucial to its success. It would be provided at five levels:
(a) Orientation Training for senior GOI and State officials in the over-
all objectives, requirements, and policy implications of the programs
supported under the project.
(b) Training in Planning, particularly in the preparation of scheme
operational plans, to be given to staff of the O&M units and selected
senior scheme-level officials.
(c) Training in Design for the engineers responsible for the revised
hydraulic designs needed to support the operational plans implemented
under the project.
(d) Implementation and Operation Training to ensure that the scheme staff
fully understand what is proposed under the project. Such training
would be given to:
(i)  scheme-level officers (here the training would focus on the
operational plan proposed); and
(ii)  scheme-level field workers, to ensure they understand what their
responsibilities are and to help create a collegiate approach to
system operations.
(e) Farmer Training to ensure that farmers understand and agree with the
system proposed and are aware of their responsibilities and those
of the Irrigation Department.
Training programs for the demonstration schemes with respect to (d) and (e)
have been prepared in the scheme proposals. Additional details are presented
in para 5.14 and SDVI, Annex 14.
3.16    Provision would also be made to assist in the development of the
Irrigation Management and Training Institute in Tamil Nadu. Detailed
architectural designs have been prepared, and Phase I of the Institute is
being established with assistance from USAID. 1/ The project would provide
funds to complete the construction of Phases II and III of the development
programn. Details ar3 provided in SDVI, Annex 14. AP has a similar
institute, which was established under the AP Composite I Project
1/ The Institute was to have been included in a proposed Cauvery rehabilita-
tion project, but this has been delayed. USAID made limited funds avail-
able to allow an early start.

(Ln.1251-IN) for the Water and Land Managemeiut Training and Research
Institute (WALMTARI). In Karnataka, the Water and Land Management Institute
(WALMI) already conducts training courses in temporary facilities. Permanent
structures are planned under the Karnataka Irrigation II Project. These
three institutes would play an important role in providing training for the
NWMP (para 5.14).
3.17    Special Studies and Programs.  Limited provision is made under the
project for consultancy services and other assistance designed to strengthen
specific aspects of water management and related matters. The funds would be
allocated to the participating States (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil
Nadu) and GOI, and would be managed by the respective PPCs and the WMC of
GOI. These funds would cover the following items:
(a) evaluation studies, by independent agencies, of the impact of opera-
tional plans in specific schemes (para 5.12 and SDVI, Annex 13);
(b) consultancy services for developing computer applications in system
operations;
(c) consultancy services and remote sensing equipment for developing
appropriate communication systems for system operations; and
(d) the costs associated with field visits by the Dam Safety Panels
(para 3.35).
Induction Training Program for Engineers in Maharashtra (MITP) 1/
3.18    Background. Irrigation Departments in the states recruit virtually
all their professional engineering staff from young civil engineering
graduates, whose education covered general civil engineering and included
little, if any, irrigation technology. Modern irrigation has developed into
a complex multidisciplinary technology involving engineering, hydrology,
agronomy, economics, sociology, and management sciences. Few institutions
are equipped to teach comprehensive courses in all these disciplines.
3.19    The objective of the Induction Training Program would be to impart an
adequate irrigation engineering background to all graduate civil engineering
recruits of the Irrigation Departments before the end of their probation
period. The engineering program would include advanced academic training in
irrigation engineering disciplines and practice-oriented training in the
field on-farm development works, irrigation practices, irrigation agronomy,
and related subjects. The program in Maharashtra would be the first of its
kind in India and, if successful, is expected to be the forerunner of similar
programs in other States.
1/ For a full description, see SDV II, Annex 15.



-20-
3.20    The Training Program.  The Irrigation Department of the Government of
Maharashtra recruits about 60 civil engineering graduates every year. The
recruits would be divided into two groups. The courses would be essentially
the same for both groups, but the emphasis would be slightly different for
group (A) Operation and Management Engineers who will operate, maintain, and
manage the systems; and group (B) Design and Construction Engineers who will
plan, design, and build projects. Engineers in group (A) would also be
trained to advise farmers on on-farm works and irrigation practices. Each
group would include about 30 officers.
3.21    The program would include Lhree main types of training, each which
would be carried out in a different training institution, where most of the
necessary infrastructure exists (the project-related costs to be funded are
summarized in Table 13:
(a) Basic Training will ensure that the recruits understand governmental
responsibilities and work procedures and the interrelationships
between the various government departments engaged in irrigation
development. This three-month training is already given to recruits
at the Engineering Staff College at Nasik, and would continue basi-
cally unchanged in the future.
(b) Technical Training would teach modern irrigation technologies and
practices, particularly in areas of project planning, the operation
of irrigation systems, on-farm irrigation works, and general water
use management. The course would be divided into academic and prac-
tice-oriented periods of about four months each, and would be given
in two Institutions:
(i) Academic Training at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT),
Bombay. This one-semester academic course would fill gaps in
classical subjects such as mathematics, statistics, hydraulics,
open channel flow, hydrology, operations research, and computer
science. At present, most of these subjects are not adequately
covered in the undergraduate curriculum of the gEneral civil
engineering degree.
(ii) Practice-Oriented Training at the Water and Land Management
Institute (WALMI) in Aurangabad. Recruits would spend one
semester at the Institute for training in the operation of
irrigation projects, water scheduling (which would cover the
techniques required to supply water to the farm gates reliably
and at the correct time) and subjects related to irrigated
agriculture, including the preparation of land for irrigation,
on-farm .rrigation practices, the supply of agricultural inputs,
and efficient water and land use.
3.22    A number of specially designed courses to be given both at IIT and
at WALMI which will relate to specific problems of irrigation in Maharashtra
(black cotton soils, difficult topography, etc.).



-21-
3.23    The training program would be organized so that only one group of
trainees (about 30 participants) would receive instruction (at the IIT or
WALMI) at any one time. Thus, the infrastructural facilities and faculties
in the two Institutions would be utilized throughout the year.
3.24    MITP Subcomponents.  The MITP subcomponents include:  (i) preparation
of course materials; (ii) provision of modern audio/visual, computer1 and
other teaching aids; (iii) incremental faculty staff costs; (iv) incremental
accommodation and classrooms; (v) direct course costs; (vi) consultancy
services; (vii) training of faculty; and (viii) incremental operation and
maintenance costs.
3.25    The total estimated cost would be about Rs 40 M (US$3.1 M), of which
about US$1.2 M would be in foreign exchenge (Table 13).
Institutional Strengthening and Training Fund (ISTP)
3.26    A Project Preparation Fund (PPF) was established under the Second
Cujarat Irrigation Project (Cr.1011-IN, in 1980, US$175.0 M) to encourage the
States to undertake more detailed data collection and project preparation,
and to promote the introduction of new planning techniques. This credit
provided US$10.0 M over a two-year period for the preparation of irrigation
projects for Bank Group Financing. Continuation funding of US$10.0 M has
been provided under the Uttar Pradesh Tubewell II Project, (UP II, Cr.
1332-IN, 1983, US$91 M).
3.27    With support from the PPF, planning agencies for the Narmada Basin
Development have been created in the States of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.
In addition, project preparation and monitoring (PPM) cells for five States
have been established in the Central Water Commission (CWC) to assist the
States in preparing medium-sized irrigation schemes. PPM cells have also
been set up in GOI's Ministry of Water Resources for the coordination and
support of selected planning studies for Narmada Basin Development. Exten-
sive use has been made of Indian consultants. Foreign consultants, in joint
ventures with local firms, have studied navigation on the Narmada River and
have carried out a comprehensive drainage investigation. Furthermore, a
panel of Indian and foreign experts has advised State organizations on the
design of several major dams. Funds have also been provided for equipment
and pilot operations. Training programs have been supported both in India
and overseas.
3.28    The PPF has been instrumental in gradually strengthening the States'
ability to plan and prepare irrigation and multipurpose water resources
projects. It has also helped to build up the domestic consulting industry
and to introduce modern planning techniques such as systems analysis. In
short, the PPF has made an important contribution to the modernization of
India's irrigation sector. The US$10.0 M provided under the existing is
expected to be fully disbursed by December 1986.
3.29    The institution-building efforts started under the first two PPFs
would be consolidated through the provision of an additional US$10.0 M for
continuing the improvement in the preparation of irrigation projects in
India. The present approach of tailoring the support to the individual
requirements of the States, for programs mutually agreed on by the Bank and



-22-
GOI would be maintained and, thus, the expected expenditures cannot be broken
down in detail. To reflect the proposed utilization of the fund, its name
has been changed to Institution Strengthening and Training Fund (ISTF). lt
is expected to be used for the following purposes: (i) support for the
preparation of irrigation projects, primarily for studies, data collection,
other project preparation activities, and pilot works; (ii) continued support
of existing and new PPM cells and strengthening of project preparation and
monitoring activities at MWR--such support would include the purchase of
equipment (such as calculators, microcomputers, and office and other techni-
cal equipment, including survey instruments), vehicles, and other nonrecur-
ring expenditures; and (iii) technical assistqnce (including consultant
services, training, and study trips for specified components under
Bank-assisted projects in India). ISTF would be managed by MWR. Activities
to be financed would be presented in a format mutually agreed by the Bank and
GOI. The authority to approve such activity would rest with the Joint
Secretary, MWR. Agreements have been reached with COI that it would: (i)
cause each state receiving ISTF proceeds to utilize the funds allocated in
accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA; and (ii) submit an annual
progress report not later than June 30 each year, commencing June 30, 1988,
itemizing and describing progress and the expenditures under the ISTF
incurred in the previous year ending March 31.
C. Status of Preparation
3.30    The schemes that the participating states would like to see included
in the project are given in Table 7 together with their cost estimates. In
addition, the table gives provisional cost estimates for schemes yet to be
identified.
3.31    Programs for completing the necessary surveys, designs, and estimates
for the physical works to be undertaken in each of the appraised schemes have
been agreed by IDA. Modified control structures (self-regulating weirs and
baffle-type offtakes) are to be introduced where appropriate, and detailed
designs are being prepared. A condition of negotiation was that GOAP, COK,
and GOTN finalize the detailed designs and estimates for the first year of
the construction program of the proposed project.
3.32    In addition to the three appraised subprojects, draft reports have
been prepared for Kurnool-Cuddapah Canal and the Nagarjunasagar left and
right bank schemes in Andhra Pradesh, Bhadra, and Tungabhadra; the left bank
schemes in Karnataka and Kodayer; and the Thambaraparani schemes in Tamil
Nadu. These schemes cover about 325,000 ha, and together with the 67,500 ha
included under the appraised subprojects account for about 63Z of the area to
be covered under the project. Two other proposed subprojects (Mylavaram and
Thandava schemes in Andhra Pradesh, covering about 50,000 ha) are also in
preparation.
3.33    The physical works for individual subprojects would normally be
completed within three years, but may extend into a fourth year for rela-
tively large schemes. The number of subprojects undertaken at any one time
will depend on the overall plan allocations and the annual budgets provided.
The overall seven-year implementation progrr.n that has been prepared is
consistent with State allocations under the ongoing Seventh Five-Year Plan
and with the Bank's standard disbursement profile for irrigation projects in



-23-
India. If additional funds can be provided in the early years, project
implementation may be completed in less than seven years. No new subproject
would be started after June 1, 1990.
3.34    The Maharashtra Induction Training Program (NITP) 1/ has been fully
prepared, details of all courses are available, and terms of reference for
the foreign consultants have been agreed with the CON.
D. General
Dam Safety
3.35    Dam safety inspections would be carried out at regular intervals (not
less than every five years) for all dams serving NWMP subprojects. They
would be carried out by independent Dam Safety Panels (DSPs) acceptable to
IDA. The DSPs would (i) inspect the sLructures in detail; (ii) reassess the
design flood if needed; (iii) interpret the observations collected since the
previous inspection; (iv) check the functioning of all hydromechanical equip-
ment; and (v) when necessary recommend modifications or repairs to the struc-
tures to improve the safety of the dam. No scheme served by dams with
unresolved safety problems will be included in the NWMP. The existing Dam
Safety Cells in each of the participating States would compile the data and
reports that the DSP would be required to review and would provide
administrative and technical support. The costs of the DSP's field visits
and other activities would be met from the project funds relegated to dam
visits in each of the respective States (para 3.17). Agreements have been
reached with GOAP, GOK, and GOTN that they would, by December 31, 1987,
establish a Dam Safety Panel with membership and terms of reference satisfac-
tory to the Association, for purposes, inter alia, of inspecting peri-
odically, and in accordance with sound engineering practices, the dams and
related structures serving NWMP schemes in order to determine whether there
are any deficiencies in the condition of such structures or in the quality
and adequacy of maintenance or methods of operation of the same, which may
endanger their safety, and shall promptly carry out any repair works which
shall be required to ensure the safety of such dams and structures.
Environmental and Ecological Impact
3.36    The marginal environmental or ecological impact of the NWMP will be
positive and may include better control of waterborne diseases because of the
rotational water supply to be adopted in many schemes and the reduction in
waterlogging brought about by minor drainage improvements.
IV. COST ESTIMATES, FINANCING, AND DISBURSEMENT
Project Cost Estimates
4.01    The project costs including physical and price contingencies, are
estimated to be US$157.0 M. This amount includes about US$9.1 M foreign
exchange, or about 6% of the total project cost. Taxes and duties included
in the total costs are negligible. Cost estimates are based on price levels
at the end of 1986. Detailed cost estimates are given in Tables 1 to 6 and
are summarized below:

Physical contingencies average 8%.  Price contingencies (282 of base costs) are
based on projected annual inflation rates for foreign and local costs of 6%,
6.8%, 6.8%, 7%, 7.1%, 4%, and 4% for the period 1986/87 to 1992/93. Engineering
and administration costs are estimated at 9% of the scheme investment civil
wovks, which is sufficient to support these minor works by an established
organization.
Financing
4.02    The proposed credit of US$114.0 N would finance 73% of total project
costs (equivalent to about 70% of the water management components and 100% of
the special training and technical assistant activities). The credit would
cover the foreign exchange component (US$9.1 M) and about 712 of local costs.
Expenditures in the participating States would be met from the development
budgets of GOAP, GOK, GOTN, and CON. States that might participate subsequently
would be required to make similar arrangements. Retroactive financing not
exceeding US$5 M would be provided for qualified expenditures incurred after
June 1, 1986. The credit would be made available to GOI on standard IDA terms.
An agreement would be reached with GOI that itvwill make the proceeds of the
credit available to the States on standard terms and arrangements for develop-
ment assistance to the States. Agreements have been reached with GOI, COAP,
GOK, GOTN, and GOM that by November 30 of each year, commencing November 30,
1987, they would prepare and furnish to IDA for its review and comments, an
implementation schedule and proposed budgetary allocations for the following



-25-
financial year and, taking into ccnsideration IDA's coments, if any, provide
the necessary resources and funds to implement the project.
Procurement
4.03    Works under the project would cost approximately US$103.0 M, which
includes physical and price contingencies.l/ Although they would be packaged
wherever practical, none of the construction activities could be grouped into
contracts greater than US$100,000; therefore, none would be of interest to
foreign contractors. The contracts will be small because the work involves only
minor modifications to many existing systems. The works would be spread over
four States and would involve approximately 25 different procurement
authorities; the awards would be made over the life of the credit. Contracts
estimated to cost more than US$40,000 would use the LCB model documents prepared
by the Central Water Commission and the smaller contracts would use a work-order
type of document. About 60Z of the works, or US$62.4 M, would be for contracts
between US$40,000 and US$100,000. The work-order contracts would be limited
to an aggregate of about 20X of the works, or US$20 M. Both types of bidding
procedures have been reviewed and found acceptable. The remaining US$20 H of
works which are small and scattered would best be accomplish6d by departmental
forces.
4.04    Goods consisting of vehicles and equipment would cost about US$2.7 M,
which includes physical and price contingencies. Packaging will be done when-
ever practical. However, like the works contracts, the goods contracts would be
small because procurement responsibility would be divided among some 25 dif-
ferent procurement authorities and requirements would be spread over the life of
the project. Each contract would be less than US$50,000 and involve only a few
of each item; therefore, foreign suppliers would not be interested. All goods
would be procured using LCB procedures that have been reviewed and found accept-
able.
4.05    Services would be procured on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA;
2/ the contracts would include about US$3.6 M for assignments to local colleges,
institutions, individuals, and consulting organizations and one large consult-
ancy package (about US$1.1 M) for the Maharashtra Induction Training Program,
which would be of interest to foreign consultants.
4.06    The procurement arrangements and disbursement amounts are summarized
in the following table:
1/ Including works on the subprojects (US$101.0 M) and US$2.0 M for civil works
under the Maharashtra Induction Training Component.
2/ Consultants will be selected in accordance with Bank guidelines.

-27-
Disbursements
4.07    Disbursement under the credit would be made for:
(i) Scheme Investments
(a) Works - 70% of approved costs;
(b) Goods - 100% of imported equipment and ex-factory
cost of local equipment;
- 70% for other locally procured equipment;
(ii) Incremental O&M Expenditures on a declining scale. For each scheme,
during the first, second and third year, disbursement would be at 100X of
incremental O&M expenditures, thereafter at zero. This would result, for
each state (aggregating the phased entry and completion of the various
schemes in that state), in a gradual overall decline in Credit disburse-
ments against O&M, at the same time simplifying disbursement accounting.
The approved scheme appraisal reports (para 5.09) would define: (i) the
estimated baseline of O&M expenditures; and (ii) year-by-year incremental
O&M expenditures. Incremental O&M expenditures are defined as the
incremental amount over the average provision in the three years prior to
the start of O&M support.
(iii)  Institutional Strenxthening, Training and Special Studies and Technical
Services, at 100% 1/ of approved expenditures.
(iv)   Maharashtra Induction Training Program.  Disbursements would be made
against 100% 1/ of the expenditures made in accordance with the approved
program (SDV II, Annex 15).
(v)   Institutional Strengthening and Training Fund.  Disbursements would be
made for 100% i/ of expenditures.
Disbursement for works constructed by departmental forces, institutional
strengthening, and for payments of less than Rs 300,000 for works and Rs 150,000
for goods itemized by sub-project, would be made against statements of expendi-
tures. Documentation of these expenditures would be retained by the responsible
irrigation department and made available for inspection by IDA during project
review missions. The estimated schsidule of expenditures is given in Table 1.
The semi-annual disbursement schedule and the proposed allocation of the
proceeds of the credit are presented in Tables 14 and 15 respectively. It is
expected that disbursements would be completed by March 31, 1994. The disburse-
ment profile assumed follows the standard Indian irrigation schedule.
4.08    To speed up disbursements, GOI has agreed to establish a special account
(SA) from which suppliers and contractors would be paid. This SA would be for
the equivalent of US$5.0 M. All expenditures from this SA would be promptly
reported and documented to the IDA to facilitate its rapid and smooth replenish-
ment. The SA may only be used to pay for expenditures eligible for reimburse-
ment by IDA.
I/ For goods the maximum disbursements would be as in (i) above.



-28-
Accounts and Audits
4.09    The project would be subject to normal Government accounting and audit
procedures. Although annual audits are carried out in a timely manner, the
finalization is a lengthy process involving the presentation of the Statutory
Audit Report to the Legislature. Therefore, it would be essential to have an
independent auditor prepare an interim certification of the annual financial
statements. Such statements certified by the responsible State Accountant
General or his designee, supported by an itemized account, a summary of the
expenditures, plus the auditor's opinion and comments would be submitted to the
Association as soon as possible, but within nine months after the end of each
fiscal year.  Thus, COI, GOAP, GOK, GOTN, and COM have agreed to:
(a) maintain or cause to be maintained records and accounts adequate to
reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices the operations,
resources and expenditures in respect of the Project;
(b) (i) have the records and accounts for each fiscal year audited, in
accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied, by
independent auditors acceptable to the Association; (ii) furnish to the
Association, as soon as available, but in any case not later than six
months after the end of such year, a certified copy of the report of
such audit by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the
Association shall have reasonably requested; and (iii) furnish to the
Association such other information concerning said records, accounts and
financial statements and the audit thereof as the Association shall from
time to time reasonably request.
(c) For all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from the Credit
Account were made on the basis of statements of expenditures;
Si) maintain records and accounts reflecting such expenditures;
(ii) retain, until at least one year after the completion of the audit
for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the Credit
Account was made, all records (contracts, orders, invoices, bills,
receipts and other documents) evidencing such expenditures;
(iii)  enable the Association's representatives to examine such records;
and
(iv) ensure that such records and accounts are included in the annual
audit and that the report of such audit contains a separate opinion
by said auditors as to whether the statements of expenditure sub-
mitted during such fiscal year, together with the procedures and
internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon
to support the related withdrawals.

V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
5.01    The Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of irrigation facilities is a
specialized activity requiring specific skills, experience, and training. In
some Indian states, O&M responsibilities are not distinguished from the other
responsibilities of the Irrigation Department, basin and project planning,
design, construction and quality control, and officers are expected to move
from one discipline to another without particular preparation. For example,
when an Irrigation Department is part of the Public Works Department, in
extreme cases engineers can be transferred directly from road design to canal
operation.
5.02    Ideally, the State's would prepare an operation plan for each basin.
Allocations among schemes within a basin would be defined and communicated to
scheme-level authorities. At the scheme level, an officially constituted
Board or Committee, representing concerned government agencies (Irrigation,
Agriculture, CAD) and users (para 5.20) would agree to the annual and
seasonal operational plan. A single organization would be responsible for
carrying out the operational plan within each scheme from the water source
to the Government outlet, and for supervising as necessary, the distribution
among the farmers below the outlet.
5.03    The organization of maintenance should directly parallel that of
operation; thus, the State would allocate funds and program work among
projects, and scheme-level staff would be responsible for all works within
the project area.
5.04    Under the NWMP, specialization of the O&M organization would be
initiated at the state level, and would be fully implemented at the scheme
level. The detailed arrangements for implementing the NWMP, and the support
to be provided, would reflect individual state circumstances (SDV I, Annex
8), but in each participating state the following would apply;
(a) the PPC would prepare NWMP subproject proposals and supervise sub-
project implementation;
(b) an O&M cell would be established to give direction to the State's O&M
activities, and to support and monitor scheme programs; 1/
(c) a scheme-level Committee representing both officials (Irrigation, CAD
and Agriculture Departments) and farmers would meet before each
irrigation season to approve the operational plan and define the
1/ Initially, this unit would remain within the existing Project Preparation
Cell in Karnataka, but in the longer term would become independent. In
Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, it would be established separately ab
initio. The balance of responsibilities between the PPCs and O&M cells
would evolve over time as the staffing of the O&M cells expands (SDV I,
Annex 8).



-30-
rules for its implementation, and would meet after each season to
evaluate the experience gained;
(d) a single O&M agency (either the ID or CADA) would be designated
before the scheme investments are completed and would be assigned
responsibility for water delivery within each scheme in accordance
with the decisions of the Committee;
(e) agricultural supporting services would be programmed in the co- .ext
of other IDA-supported projects to complement the irrigation manage-
ment programs adopted (para 5.18); and
(f) systematic linkages would be developed between the O&M agency, other
Government agencies, and the farmers (para 5.20).
The GOI Water Management Cell (WMC)
5.05    The WMC within the GOI Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) would be
responsible for coordinating project implementation and would provide
administrative and technical support for the NWMP appraisal committee. This
committee would be chaired by the Additional Secretary, Ministry of Water
Resources, and its members would be drawn from relevant MWR departments, CWC,
the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research
(ICAR). An understanding has been reached with GOI that the Water Management
Cell would be strengthened and maintained according to a program and
timetable satisfactory to IDA.
State-Level Organization
5.06    To provide for the necessary State level reorganization and
strengthening (para 3.11-3.12), agreements have been reached with COAP, GOK
and GOTN that they would establish and thereafter maintain or strengthen PPCs
and O&M cells in accordance with a program and timetable satisfactory to IDA.
Scheme-Level Organization
5.07    Agreements have been reached with GOAP, COK and GOTM that they would,
one year prior to completion of each NWMP scheme, establish and/or maintain
a scheme-level committee for each NWMP subproject with responsibility for
formulating annual and seasonal operational plans and with representation of
agencies and farmers satisfactory to IDA. The Comnittee would comprise
officials from Irrigation, Agriculture, CAD and PWD Departments as
appropriate, together with farmer representatives. The responsibilities and
powers of the Committee would be defined in each scheme proposal.
Selection and Approval of NWMP Subprojects
5.08    Primary responsibility for selection, preparation and presentation of
schemes would rest with the State Governments concerned. However, GOI
clearance would be required to ensure consistency and adherence to NWMP
criteria. In this respect, agreements have been reached with GOAP, GOK and
GOTN that they would select, plan, design and seek approval of schemes under
the NWHP in accordance with procedures, standards and criteria satisfactory
to IDA.



-31-
5.09    Schemes selected must have the prospect of improved operation with
limited investments of the order anticipated under the NWMP. Schemes would
be prepared by the respective State PPC and would be cleared according to the
procedures set out in Schedule A. No scheme having any unresolved dam safety
issues would be selected (para 3.35). The approved report would form the
basis for disbursements under the IDA credit (para 4.07) and inter alia would
specify: (i) the area on which disbursements would be based; (ii) the
estimated costs of the scheme investments; (iii) the incremental O&M costs,
year by year; and (iv) scheme level training plans. Inclusion of
sub-projects in States other than Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
would be subject to Bank agreement and clearance by the NWMP Appraisal Com-
mittee in the MWR.
Munitoring and Evaluation
5.10    Physical and financial progress of the NIMP at the State level would
be monitored hy the PPC based on information provided by scK,ane staff.
5.11    At the scheme level, the operational plan would form the basis for
monitoring system operations.  Regular reports would be submitted to the
project committee recording the outcome of seasonal/annual operations (water
deliveries, irrigation deficiencies, cropped areas, farmers' satisfaction)
and evaluating performance. Taking into account the successes and failures
of previous seasons, the operational plan would be modified and operations
for the coming season would be defined. Thus, scheme level M&E would be an
essential element of scheme management. An M&E plan consistent with manage-
ment requirements and manpower availability would be prepared for each scheme
and form a part of its O&M plan. The PPCs and/or O&M cells at the State
level would help introduce M&E practices at the scheme level, develop report-
ing formats and procedures, and monitor progress.
5.12    The PPCs and/or O&M cells would also commission evaluation and other
studies from outside agencies to provide an independent assessment of scheme
operations or to investigate specific aspects in depth. Taking these into
account, as well as the regular reports of scheme staff, the O&M cell would
help evolve O&M policies statewide and ensure that information regarding
successful and unsuccessful interventions is shared among schemes. The WMC
in the MWR would similarly ensure that experience is shared among States.
5.13    The basic guidelines for M&E have been developed (SDV I, Annex 13)
and will be further refined. Agreements have been reached with GOAP, GOK and
GOTN that they would, by December 31, 1987, prepare a detailed M&E program
satisfactory to IDA and implement the program accordingly. Agreements with
GOI, GOAP, GOK and GOTN have been reached that they would: (i) prepare and
furnish to IDA annual progress reports through the WMC, with the WMC respon-
sible for collating State reports and summarizing overall project progress;
and (ii) furnish such reports to IDA within three months after the end of
each reporting period with the first report to be submitted by June 30, l9P8.
In addition, agreement has been reached with GOI that a project completion
report would be submitted not later than six months after the project's
Closing Date.



-32-
Training
5.14    The training program set out above (para 3.15) and discussed in more
detail in SDV I, Annex 14, would be organized as follows. Orientation and
officer-training seminars and courses would be organized in each State by the
respective WALMI, or equivalent, working closely with the PPCs/O&M Cells.
Each WALMI would prepare a detailed traizing program and would place an
officer in charge of each scheme. He would participate in the initial train-
ing programs and would subsequently be available to the scheme authorities
for refresher seminars and courses. The WALMIs would also be responsible for
developing the training courses and materials to be used in introducing the
program to field workers and farmers at the scheme level. The designated
WALMI officer would initiate this program, and would provide training and
assistance to scheme-level officers, who would subsequently be responsible
for farmer training. In large schemes, it is envisaged that a full-time
training officer with appropriate support staff will be appointed. In
smaller schemes, the scheme officers themselves would be fully responsible
and they might be provided with an incentive honorarium related to the scale
of the program adopted.
5.15    In view of the considerable administrative and organizational work
expected, the PPC would put an officer in charge of training aspects of the
project.  He woule be responsible for liaising closely with the WALMI con-
cerning officer training and for monitoring scheme-level work and farmer
training programs as they are implemented in each scheme. Scheme-level
training programs would be defined in the scheme reports. For training
components that are not part of specific scheme proposals, agreements have
been reached with GOAP, GOK and GOTN that they would: (i) by December 31,
1987, prepare and furnish to the Association for its review and comments,
detailed schedules for the training program under the Project, and there-
after, taking into account the Association's comments, if any, implement such
training programs.
5.16    WMC would be responsible for scheduling a program of courses, semi-
nars, and study programs for its own staff and for common inter-State
programs (including overseas training) for staff of the State O&M Units and
selected senior officers in NWMP schemes. An understanding has been reached
with GOI that it would by December 31, 1987, prepare detailed schedules for
the training program for which the WMC is responsible and, after consultation
with IDA, implement the program accordingly.



-33-
Maharashtra Induction Training Program (MITP) 1/
5.17    The MITP will be managed at three levels:  (i) a Committee of Direc-
tion; (ii) a Management Committee; and (iii) the Board of Studies. The
Committee of Direction will include representatives from  OI and CO  and will
provide overall guidance for the induction training policy. The Management
Committee will be responsible for the implementation, including administra-
tion, financial management, technical coordination, and course content. The
Board of Studies will advise on course content and be responsible for project
monitoring and evaluation. Agreements have been reached with COM that it
would: (i) furnish detailed schedules for the training programs under the
MITP to IDA for its review and comments, and taking in consideration IDA's
comments, implement th programs accordingly; (ii) by December 31, 1987,
establish and thereafter maintain a Management Committee for the MITP with
representation satisfactory to IDA; and (iii) prepare and furnish to IDA
annual progress reports through the WMC within three months of the end of
each reporting period, with the first report submitted by June 30, 1988.
Agricultural Supporting Servi:es
5.18    Agricultural Extension (SDV I, Annex 10).  A professional agricul-
tural extension service, organized on Training and Visit (T&V) principles,
has been established with Bank support in each of the States concerned, 2/
and no funds would be provided for financing these services directly under
the NWMP. Specific measures would be taken within the context of these
extension projects to: (i) ensure that the field-level organization in NWMP
subproject areas is fully staffed; (ii) reorganize VEW farmer groups, as far
as possible, on an outlet basis; and (iii) appoint water management Subject
Matter Specialists (SMSs) in the Districts/Zones where NWMP subprojects are
implemented who would contribute to the design of operational interventions
and train extension staff concerning the implications for farmer operations.
In this respect, agreements have been reached with GOAP, GOK and GOTN that
they would: (i) provide appropriate staffing, facilities, services and the
other resources required to carry out effective agricultural extension satis-
factory to IDA throughout the proposed project districts; and (ii) ensure
that such extension services would be fully operational and staffed by the
time that project works are completed.

have been transferred to the Agricultural Department. In Karnataka,
2,000 field staff have reverted to the Department of Rural Development
following court action, and although staff shortages will persist, steps
are being taken to replace extension staff. In Tamil Nadu, there are no
major obstacles, and substantial progress has been made in establishing
an effective service.



-34-
5.19    Agricultural Research (SDV I, Annex 9).  Clear extension messages for
on-farm water management practices are critically dependent on field-oriented
agricultural research programs, focussed on the particular problems of each
command and responding to the opportunities created by the operational plans.
Furthermore, the plan itself should reflect the results of operational
research undertaken jointly by the State Agricultural Universities, the DOE,
the ID and the farmers. Special subprojects in water management research
would be prepared for submission to ICAR under the ongoing National Agricul-
tural Research Project (Cr. 1631-IN), which take into account the specific
requirements of the NWMP sub-project areas. While responding to the broader
requirements of the State, these proposals would be implemented in parallel
with, and in support of, the measures introduced under the NWMP and, together
with the extension measures outlined above, should help farmers take
advantage of the opportunities created.
5.20    Inter-agency Linkages (SDV I, Annex 11).  Systematic linkages would
be established between the agencies concerned, notably the ID and the exten-
sion and research services, to ensure that their operations are coordinated
and coherent. Such coordination would be required both at the planning stage
ard during implementation. To ensure consistent technical recommendations to
the scheme's decision-making body, the staff in charge of scheme operations
would meet, prior to preseasonal meetings of the project committee, with
their counterparts in the DOA and other agencies. T3 ensure regular interac-
tion during implementation, ID staff would participate in the monthly
research and extension workshops (at SE/EE level) and fortnightly training
sessions (at AEE/Work Inspector levels) established under the T&V extension
system.
5.21    Farmer Organizations (SDV I, Annex 12).  Informal farmer organiza-
tions have been established in many schemes, and existing legislation often
envisages more formal arrangements (e.g., the 1984 Andhra Pradesh Irrigation
Utilization and Command Area Development Act). Once a reliable water supply
is provided, such organizations can be expected to operate more effectively
(para 2.18). They would be promoted in NWMP schemes on an
outlet/minor/distributary basis by the ID/PWD (in Karnataka, in association
with CADA; see SDV I, Annex 8). Initially, such organizations would con-
centrate on water distribution and maintenance below the Government outlet
and would be a mechanism for systematic interaction between the farmers and
the project authorities. Ultimately, they might be fully integrated into the
management of the scheme (e.g., through elected representatives on the scheme
committee). The speed with which this can be achieved would depend on the
effectiveness of the operational plan adopted and would vary from scheme to
scheme.
VI. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, FARM INCOMES AND COST RECOVERY
A. Agricultural Production
Introduction
6.01    The project would increase agricultural output primarily through more
effective use of canal supplies. Changes in the timing of irrigation issues,
in the methods of water delivery, in the efficiency of water use, and in the
effectiveness of supporting services would by themselves and together modify



-35-
cropping patterns, increase irrigation intensities, and raise yields and
value added. These changes should also ensure more effective utilization of
groundwater resources. They would not normally augment canal supplies,
although this may occur when reservoir operations are modified or reservoir,
tank, or canal carrying capacities are increased.
6.02    The relative importance and effect of different interventions would
vary widely. In many cases, higher production can be achieved as a result of
operational changes alone. In all cases, however, higher production would be
consolidated and augmented by the physical works to be financed under the
project. To illustrate the likely production impact, three schemes have been
evaluated in detail: the Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme (RDS) in Andhra
Pradesh, the Vanivilas Sagar Scheme (VVS) in Karnataka, and the Sathanur
Scheme (SS) in Tamil Nadu. No allowance has been made for any impact on
groundwater abstractions, although this could be significant, particularly in
the case of he Sathanur Scheme. Nor have the possibilities for augmenting
canal supplies been taken irto account, although this can be envisaged in all
three ca-ts: in RDS if the capacity of the main canal is increased under a
second phase, in VVS as a result of improved utilization of drainage run-off
at the downstream Narayanapura Anicut, and in SS if the rules governing
releases for the downstream ayacut (the "old" ayacut) were modified (see SDV
I, Annexes 5, 6, and 7).
6.03    The projected increases in production represent an assessment of the
project's direct impact and do not represent the full long-term potential.
With experience, further changes may prove desirable, possibly with the
support of additional modernization investments. Higher field application
efficiencies, increased yields, and/or the the spread of high-value cropping
may also result from parallel agricultural research and extension programs or
from farmer response to market forces. Thus, although a systematic approach
to operations is a prerequisite for achieving a scheme's full potential, it
represents only one step in a continuing process.
Impact on Agricultural Production in Selected Subprojects
6.04    Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme (SDV I, Annex 5).  The principal fea-
tures of the proposed operational plan are to: (i) preclude paddy in middle
and lower reaches in kharif and throughout the command in rabi by introducing
systematic intermittent irrigation; 1/ (ii) stagger kharif cropping by sub-
command down the main canal; (iii) constrair the period of cropping and
encourage short-season varieties by adhering to pre-announced canal closure
dates; and (iv) support cotton cultivation in blocks where it has been estab-
lished. These objectives would be supported by investments designed inter
alia to improve system control, modify canal capacities as required, reduce
canal losses, and rehabilitate the channel system. Given the history of the
scheme and its severe water shortage, it is unrealistic to expect water to be
spread equitably throughout the command. Rather, the aim vould be to serve
the existing irrigated areas more effectively. Thus, in rabi, the area
1/ Even if this objective is generally achieved, limited areas of paddy
would probably continue in areas affected by salinity and/or waterlog-
ging.



-36-
served would be reduced in order to avoid repeating past failures. In
kharif, the area can be extended by limiting paddy and, if AP can reach an
agreement with Karnataka to remodel the main delivery system (Stage II of the
proposed plan), it might be possible to extend the kharif area over most of
the CCA. Table 18 summarizes the expected impact on yields, cropped areas,
and production.
6.05    Vanivilas Sagar Scheme (SDV I, Annex 6).3 The principal features of
the proposed plan are to: (i) carry over 375 Mm of stored water to guaran-
tee the perennial garden crops and ensure a full irrigated kharif crop over
an increased authorized command (from 11,000 to 14,000 ha); (ii) provide
water for rabi only if a sufficient amount is available for the full
increased command (estimated to occur 2 years out of 10); (iii) adapt the
intermittent schedule to respond better to the requirements of ID crops (by
reducing the irrigation interval and responding to peak demands); (iv) con-
centrate paddy in low-lying areas and discourage sugarcane cultivation by not
reopening the factory; 1/ (v) maintain steady runoff flows at the downstream
Narayanapura Anicut by alternating operations of the LB and RB canals; and
(vi) substitute direct canal supplies for those now served by pumping return
flows. These and other measures would be supported by rehabilitating the
canals and structures, providing new control structures, extending the dis-
tribution system where necessary, providing field channels/drains in the
extended command, and lining vulnerable sections of the main and distributary
canals. As a result, some improvement can be expected in water use efficien-
cies: the area under high-value garden crops would continue to increase; and
kharif cropping would be assured. Since the garden crop area would expand
even without the project, Table 19 summarizes the expected impact on cropping
with respect to average conditions of the past ten years and to projected
future "without" project conditions.
6.06    Sathanur Scheme (SDV I, Annex 7).  The main features of the proposed
plan are to: (i operate the left and right bank commands on a common basis,
opening the canals in mid-December to serve the full area if storage is
available and a limited area in poor years; (ii) provide water on an inter-
mittent schedule, and with a closing data responsive to ID requirements, thus
preclude paddy on the direct ayacut except in low-lying areas with supplemen-
tal groundwater; (iii) provide direct supplementary supplies to the system
tanks to allow a full paddy crop during the NE monsoon, utilizing tank
storage to exploit surplus flows in good years; (iv) provide supplementary
irrigation during kharif to support ID cropping during dry spells to the
extent allowed by carryover and summer flows; and (v) review the rules
governing releases for the downstream ayacut and for the operation of
upstream storages, within a river basin context, with a view to developing
revised rules for optimizing water use. These and other measures will be
supported by investments designed inter alia to improve system control;
rehabilitate canals, tanks, and structures; modify canal capacities; extend
the distribution system as required; ard provide for direct supply to the
tanks. As a result, some improvement can be expected in water use efficien-
cies: in about 50% of all years, there would be a full post-monsoon ID crop
1/ The factory would require considerable capital investment to
rehabilitate.



-37-
together with supplementary supplies during the monsoon equivalent to three
irrigations; in about 252 of all years, there would only be a post-monsoon
crop; and in the remaining years there would only bt a restricted
post-monsoon crop. In most years, there would also be a full paddy crop
under the tanks. Table 20 sumnarizes the expected impact on yields, cropping
patterns, and production.
Conclusions
6.07    These three schemes indicate the likely impact of the NWMP on
agricultural production. In general, the project is expected to have the
following effect:
(a)  a decline in paddy, and perhaps sugarcane production as high
water-use crops are replaced by those utilizing water more effi
ciently;
(b) a marked increase in the output of oilseeds and pulses;
(c) a limited impact, either positive or negative, on the output of
coarse grains depending on the relative importance of the substitu-
tion of rainfed by irrigated cropping; and
(d) a positive, and perhaps substantial impact on high-value cash crops
such as cotton and coconut.
Crop diversification may be greater than suggested above, in particular if
there is a significant impact on groundwater extractions, with vegetables,
farm forestry and horticultural crops all being promoted. Furthermore, while
crops grown on residual moisture may be affected adversely by declining paddy
cultivation, new opportunities should be created following irrigated kharif
crops and through better control over the timing of crop cultivation. While
paddy may decline overall, it would still predominate below system tanks and
in low-lying areas where seepage precludes other crops, and would continue to
have an important role in the overall cropping system.
6.08    Assuming these three schemes are representative of the NWMP as a
whole, then the total impact of the project might be in the order of the
following:

B.  FARM INCOMES
Market Prospects and Prices
6.09    Incremental production would be a small percentage of South India's
total agricultural output and could be readily handled through existing
marketing channels. Prices of foodgrains have adjusted to the marginal
surpluses that India has achieved in recent years and are expected to remain
more or less at their present levels in real terms. Prices of groundnuts and
other oilseeds are also likely to remain fairly steady, despite an expected
decline in world market prices, given India's high income elasticity of
demand for edible oils and GOI's continuing efforts to reduce its large
vegetable oil imports. Cotton prices will be determined primarily by the
world market, although Government intervention through tax and other measures
tQ assist the textile industry is likely to keep domestic prices below those
on the world market. In contrast, sugarcane prices have tended to exceed the
import equivalent price, except during periods of world shortage. Given the
project's widely dispersed impact and the modest increases in production to
be expected in any one location, no significant impact on domestic price
levels or marketing channels is envisaged.
Farm Incomes
6.10    With the introduction of improved irrigation plans, the distribution
of water to farmers can be expected to change--usually the volume of water
used at the head decreases, and that at the tail increases. Experience thus
far is that this does not cause great difficulties: first, because the
planned pattern of distribution is published, the equity of the proposal is
clear to all concerned parties; second, a major cause of overirrigation is
the desire to insure against uncertain supplies, but the plan of operation
will greatly reduce uncertainty. Farm incomes vary enormously, depending on
the size of farm, the crops grown, and the irrigation service provided. To
illustrate the direct impact of the project, representative farm budgets have
been compiled for the three schemes appraised. The results are summarized
below and the details given in Table 28.

Average Farm                      3.0          17,190    22,410         5,220
Sathanur Scheme
Average Farm                      1.5           5,535      7,255        1,720
6.11    In the RDS, irrigation intensity is expected to remain below 70% and
the major objective is to serve this limited area in a more reliable manner
(para 6.04). As a result, incomes are expected to rise by about 30%, with
hieher incomes accruing to farmers receiving rabi rather than kharif supplies



-39-
since they have the potential to obtain enhanced yields (notably of ground-
nuts) as well as an additional rainfed crop. In practice, some head-end
farmers obtain both rabi and kharif supplies whereas many tail-end farmers
remain dependent on subsistence rainfed farming. Cotton farmers tend tc have
larger farms and to obtain higher incomes in return for heavy cash outlays.
Following project implementation, the above estimates--which are based on an
average family size of six--are equivalent to about US$405 per capita for
irrigated cotton farmers, about US$155 for rabi farmers, US$100 for kharif
farmers, and US$30 for those dependent only on rainfed farming.
6.12    The objective in the VVS and SS is to distribute available supplies
in an equitable manner throughout the command (paras 6.05-6.06). Although
farm sizes and cropping activities vary, most farmers have both garden and
field cropland in VVS, and both paddy land under a tank and higher land in
SS. In both cases, therefore, budgets have been estimated for an "average"
farm based on the overall assumed cropping pattern and relative farm sizes.
The higher incomes projected for VVS reflect the prevalence of high-value
garden crops and larger farms and, following project implementation, are
expected to reach the equivalent of about US$285 per capita. In SS, the
corresponding level is only US$95 as a result of the greater farm population,
although those farmers with a well can expect irrigated crop intensities, and
hence farm incomes, to be substantially higher than the projected average of
about 154% (Table 20).
6.13    The estimates presented suggest that average farm incomes may rise by
about 25-33% as a direct result of the NWMP. This provides a reasonable
;iLcentive for ensuring adequate farmer response to the opportunities created
by the Project. Since it is still assumed that yields will remain well below
their theoretical potential, the longer-term impact of the project may be
considerably greater. Without a reliable and predictable water supply, there
is little prospect of realizing this potential but, in order to do so, other
complementary agricultural research, extension, and related measures are also
required (see SDV I, Annexes 9, 10, and 11).
C. O&M FUNDING AND COST RECOVERY
Background
6.14    It has been the policy of GOI and most states that water and water
related charges should cover O&M costs and a proportion of capital costs
taking into account farmer repayment capacity. However, at issue are: (i)
what would be an appropriate level of O&M; and (ii) the most effective
recovery methods given the inequity and unreliability of water supply in most
irrigation projects, the administrative constraints and the political
environment.
O&M Funding
6.15    There is a general awareness in India of the need to improve the
level of maintenance. However, the way of achieving this objective with
least cost and on a sustainable basis under varying conditions is not
entirely clear and needs additional studies and investigations. It is
generally felt that the share of O&M allocations spent on actual maintenance
works is too low and that additional allocation of funds to O&M could be



-40-
absorbed by staff costs unless accompanied by reorganization of O&M opera-
tions and formulation of standard O&M procedures. Another issue related to
O&M is the possible involvement of water users' groups (WUG) in both opera-
tion and maintenance which could reduce the part of O&M costs borne by the
government. Once main system supplies are provided reliably, farmers can be
expected to assume greater responsibility for minor system O&M (para 2.18).
However, while success with WUG has been rather localized, their active
involvement on a large scale is being tried throughout India and some sig-
nificant results can be expected within the next 2-3 years. The method of
system operation will also affect the O&M costs; for example, a system with
minimal number of gates operated according to the warabundi principles (para
2.06) would cost less than a system operating under Shejpali (para 2.10) as
manpower requirement would be smaller. The implementation of the NWMP sub-
projects would provide valuable experience with improved O&M planning proce-
dures at the scheme level.
6.16    While GOI and the Stntes are genuinely interested in identifying and
implementing viable O&M solutions, the discussion above indicates that the
problem is more complex than estimating a statewide figure for O&M costs.
Increasing financial allocations to O&M is not likely to be sufficient
without concurrent solutions to the complex management issues. The bulk of
such increase could result in an enlargement of an already excessive estab-
lishment, rather than be spent on much needed maintenance works.
6.17    To enable the formulation of a viable O&M policy for each state, the
project would support the following:
(a) a properly staffed state-level O&M cell for overall direction of O&M
activities, as well as planning, implementation and monitoring of
scheme level O&M programs (para 3.12);
(b)  the incremental O&M costs in NWMP schemes would be partly funded --on
a declining scale--under the project, with the respective States
committed to a scheme-specific level of O&M activities, which would
be closely monitored; and
(c)  an. interim O&M program review would be carried out, the purpose of
which would be to review initial progress in the pilot schemes and
develop detailed plans for further studies and investigations which
the project-supported O&M cells would then extend, as appropriate, to
other State irrigation systems.
Agreements have been reached with GOAP, GOK and GOTM to: (i) under terms of
reference satisfactory to IDA, carry out a detailed interim operation and
maintenance review of the Schemes; (ii) by December 31, 1991, in consultation
with IDA, review the results of the review; and (iii) taking into account
such review and the operation and maintenance experience gained in other
irrigation projects elsewhere in each Participating State, not later than
December 31, 1992, in consultation with IDA, prepare an appropriate Action
Plan for improving operation and maintenance practices in each of the Par-
ticipating States, and, promptly thereafter, initiate the implementation of
such Action Plan.

Cost Recovery
6.18    General.  The main sources of cost recovery from irrigation projects
are: (i) direct water charges; and (ii) indirect charges, mainly a sales
tax. Changes in the level of water charges have to be approved by the Legis-
lature in each State. For administrative reasons, water charges in most
states are usually uniform throughout the State, by crop and season. Most of
the States have difficult recovering costs through water charges since water
supply is unreliable and inequitable in many irrigation systems, and there-
fore, farmers are reluctant to pay water charges. Consequently, a con-
siderable part of the recovery is indirect, through the sales tax on marketed
output.
6.19    Improvement in irrigation services of the type proposed under NIMP
would improve cost recovery in two main ways: (i) improved collection of
water charges--experience has shown that where water supply is reliable,
farmers are more willing to pay; and (ii) increased state revenues from a
sales tax on part of the incrementaL production resulting from such improve-
ments reaching the marketplace.
6.20    Cost Recovery in Participating States.  Direct charges for irrigation
are higher in Andhra Pradesh than in Karnataka or Tamil Nadu, but are still
fairly low, and the procedures for their assessment and collection are
generally inadequate. In Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, betterment levies
have been successfully challenged in the courts, and even in Tamil Nadu it
would be extremely difficult to levy such a charge under the NWMP, given the
project's limited physical improvements. The most important sources of cost
recovery--notably the sales tax on incremental agricultural output--are
likely to be indirect. In addition, the rate of collection of direct water
charges should improve.
6.21    In all States, a water-related charge is levied on publicly operated
schemes, with the receipts entering the Government's general revenue account;
however, farmers are eligible for remission if water is not received. The
system and levels at which charges are levied differ from State to State:
(a) Andhra Pradesh. Both assessment and collection are undertaken by the
Revenue Department, and the charges discriminate among crops,
categories of irrigation service, and first and second/third crops.
Rates were increased by more than 50% in March 1986 as follows:

(b) Karnataka. Assessment is made by the Irrigation Department--in
principle, it is based on a joint inspection with Revenue offi-
cials--and collection occurs through revenues. Various Government
Orders have been issued revising rates (in 1979, 1980, and 1985), but
in the absence of legal sanction, collection continues at the levels
established in 1976. The 1985 proposals will become eff;ective once
the Irrigation Rules have been amended, probably by 1988. They
compare with the 1976 levels as follows:

(c)  Tamil Nadu.  Water charges are collected and assessed by the Revenue
Department as part of land revenue. The basis has varied over time
and between regions, and reflects the quality of land, the irrigation
source and the crops grown. As a result, the system is complex and
features over 20 categories of land and six categories of irrigation
service. The element of collection attributable to water ranges from
Rs 45-100/ha and, in addition, there are crop-specific levies on
commercial crops ranging from Rs 30-50/ha.  The present system dates
from a time when land taxes were a major component of Government
revenue. Now that they account for no more than 0.5% of the total,
GOTN has recognized Lhat the system is unsatisfactory. A Select
Committee has therefore been established to review how the system
could be rationalized, and the Committee's report is under considera-
tion by Government.
6.22    In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the water charge (water component
of land revenue in Tamil Nadu) more than covers the current O&M allocation
(in Tamil Nadu, because the latter is so low, this charge is likely to be
increased as enhanced O&M plans are developed). In Karnataka, charges barely
cover the current (relatively high) O&M costs. Nevertheless, in all three
States, a sales tax is levied at about 4% of the marketed value of agricul-
tural production, which, together with water charges, produces revenue that
exceeds the proposed O&M allocations.
6.23    Cost Recovery Agreements in Ongoing Bank-Supported Projects.  The
recent increase in water charges in Andhra Pradesh meets the terms of the
Credit Agreement of the AP Irrigation II Project (Cr. 1665-IN), which
1/ Proportionally lower rates are levied on medium schemes without secure
supplies and also on minor schemes.



-43-
required COAP to revise, by May 30, 1986, the level of water charges so as to
cover full O&M costs and "a reasonable portion of the capital costs taking
into account farmer repayment capacity." Under the same agreement, a Water
Charges Review Committee is to be established by March 31, 1987 to review the
method of assessment and collection. A report is to be submitted by Septem-
ber 30, 1987, and, if recommended, and subject to Bank comments, a new system
would be introduced. Commencing July 1, 1989, and every second year, the
Committee would recommend, and if necessary GOAP would increase, the levels
of water and related charges in accordance with the new system. Together
with the commitment to provide the Bank/IDA with a report on the level of O&M
expenditures in the project areas, GOAP is committed to a time bound program
to review the level of water charges, and implement institutional changes
designed to ensure that the levels are kept under continuing review.
6.24    Under the Karnataka Tanks Project (Cr. 1116-IN), COK is committed
to providing certain studies inter alia reviewing the level of water charges
in tank commands. With the delay in completion of several of the tank sys-
tems in which new cost recove:y practices were to be tested, it will not be
possible to complete the pilot observations and study earlier than June 1,
1987, (about two years later than initially expected) Under the proposed
Upper Krishna II Project, also in Karnataka, and expected to be appraised in
early 1987, an appropriate state water charge review and improvements to the
billing and collection mechanisms is expected.
6.25    In Tamil Nadu, GOTN is committed under the Periyar Vaigai II Project
(Cr. 1468-IN) agreement to review its system of charges in the project area
and, after consultation with IDA, consolidate water charges and thereafter
apply revised rates, reviewed annually. A report has been provided to IDA
which meets the terms of the agreement, and this will be discussed with COTN
in the near future. A high level committee, chaired by the Chief Secretary,
is reviewing the implications of this report and other evidence for the
system of water charges as a whole.
Cost Recovery Under the Project
6.26    For the three representative schemes, estimates of cost recovery
(assuming the existing rates in AP and TN and the proposed rates in Kar-
nataka) are as follows:

b/ This is lower than the expected average because Sathanur Scheme has a
low canal length/hectare commanded ratio. The position will be
monitored as the project progresses.
The relatively low receipts for RDS in Andhra Pradesh reflect the low crop-
ping intensity for this scheme: for most Andhra Schemes, receipts per hec-
tare would be substantially higher. For all three schemes, estimates of
project rent have been prepared.  These range from about 750-1,500 Rs/ha



-44-
(Table 21) and suggest there is room for increasing direct charges as the
predicted benefits materialize.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Introduction
7.01    Project benefits would arise from management changes, which would
involve little economic cost; if the project was successful, its primary
achievement would be to establish a systematic, and replicable, approach to
improving the utilization of previously created assets. Furthermore, rela-
tively minor increases in agricultural value added would more than justify
the direct costs involved and result in a high rate of return.
7.02    With these factors in mind, an attempt has been made to evaluate the
project in two ways. First, a conventional economic analysis of the three
representative schemes has been undertaken using the best estimates of the
project's impact on cropping and production. Care has been taken to ensure
that the "without" and "with" project cacps reflect common assumptions for
total water availability, and sensitivity tests have been undertaken to show
how economic returns are affected by changes in the main assumptions.
Secondly, again using these three schemes to represent agricultural condi-
tions, estimates have been made of the changes in cropping patterns and crop
yields that would be necessary to justify, at the assumed opportunity cost of
capital, various levels of expenditure per hectare.
Basic Assumptions for the Economic Analysis
7.03    The assumptions for the economic analysis are detailed in Annex 1.
Economic prices for tradable crops (rice, cotton, sugarcane, coconut and
copra, groundnuts) and inputs (fertilizer) were derived from IBRD world
market price projections, and prices for nontraded goods were derived from
prevailing and projected domestic market prices (Tables 12 & 13). Most
studies of farm labor supply and demand in India suggest that the ratio of
economic wage to market wage is 0.50 to 0.70. The shadow wage of agricul-
tural labor has therefore been assumed to be 67% of the going wage rate for
hired labor. The economic costs of civil works were evaluated using a
specific conversion factor of 0.75, which reflects mainly the overvaluation
of labor in the financial cost of works and some distortion in the price of
equipment and materials. Investment costs in the first three years of the
scheme are assumed to occur in the ratio 20:50:30, and increases in agricul-
tural value added (due to a combination of changing crop patterns, inten-
sities, and yields) should take place in four equal steps from years two to
five, except in the case of Vanivilas Sagar, for which long gestation garden
crops are important and a ten-to fifteen-year period is assumed. The oppor-
tunity cost of capital in India is taken to be 12X, and costs and benefits
have been discounted over a 25-year period.
Economic Analysis - Representative Schemes
7.04    The Net Present Value (NPV) at the opportunity cost of capital as
well as the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for each of the three schemes, and
for the three schemes taken together, are estimated as follows:



-45-
NVP at 121         ERR
Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme                  Rs 108 M          29X
Vanivilas Sagar Scheme                        Rs  74 K          45%
Sathanur Scheme                               Rs  78 M          431
Total:  Three Schemes                      Rs 260 M          37X
7.05    Sensitivity Analysis.  The effect of deviations from the main assump-
tions on the economic viability of the project are as follows:
ERR: 1
RDS     VVS      Ss
Base Case                                         29       45     43
No impact on yields                                0       23     21
51 higher "with" yields                           36       54     55
101 reduction in "with" irrigated areas           22       30     61
201 reduction in "with" irrigated areas           13       21     17
10X increase in "with" irrigated areas            36      60      21
331 increase in costs                             23       37     34
201 reduction in economic prices                  22       36     34
7.06    Two main conclusions can be drawn from these estimates.  First, high
economic returns can be expected even with the limited agricultural impact
assumed under the project. Second, fairly small changes in these assumptions
significantly affect the outcome. In contrast, cost and price assumptions
can be modified by a considerably greater amount without having a comparable
effect. The lower return for RDS than for the other two schemes reflects the
modest expected impact on overall cropped areas. Indeed, if yield effects
are excluded (in other words, if benefits are attributable solely to the
impact on cropping patterns and intensities) the ERR for RDS falls below the
opportunity cost of capital, the only case in the alternatives illustrated
above.
Economic Analysis - Alternative Expenditures per Hectare
7.07    The project's impact on agricultural production is expressed essen-
tially in terms of six representative crop types for which average net
economic returns in the three schemes are as follows:

benefits are as specified, the following proportional changes can be expected
in the specified cropping characteristics that would be necessary to justify

(c) Water requirements for irrigated ID crops, cash crops, and

-47-
7.09    These results confirm that a fairly limited impact on cropping pat-
terns and irrigated intensities would justify the expenditures proposed under
the project. For instance, a conversion of 20% of the command area from
rainfed to irrigated ID cropping or of 18% of the command from paddy to
irrigated ID cropping (allowing for the increase in cropped area as a result
of reduced water requirements per ha) would cover expenditures of Rs 2,500/ha
assuming no other effects. The experience quoted in Chapter II, and the
assessment of the three representative schemes, suggests that both area and
yield effects considerably above those assumed are entirely feasible.
7.10    The project can be expected to have a significant effect on employ-
ment. The civil works would be labor intensive, and the effect of improved
operation on the area irrigated would directly increase demand for on-farm
labor.
Project Risks
7.11    The major risks associated with the project relate to the sus-
tainability of the operational programs to be supported. The project aims to
make explicit those programs that are adopted, provide field staff with the
necessary guidance and support, and hold them accountable for performance.
However, there is no certain guarantee that the project will be able to
sustain programs involving changes in water allocation to farmers, in the
face of vested interests and the many other pressures that affect scheme
operations. Current practices are normally a response to these cumulative
pressures, and holding scheme staff accountable for improved practices would
undoubtedly make their jobs more difficult in many cases.
7.12    These risks are real, but many of them are inherent in most existing
projects in the irrigation sector. The project would itself provide sig-
nificant opportunities for institutional strengthening and training, which,
together with other programs, would help moderate and resolve such problems
in the longer term. Although the changes to be introduced may prove dif-
ficult to sustain in certain cases, and the impact on agricultural production
may therefore be short-lived, the potential agricultural benefits are such
that these risks are acceptable. In particular, evidence from on-going
schemes suggests that significant benefits could be achieved for the majority
of farmers.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01    Agreements have been reached with GOI that it would:

reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices the operations,
resources and expenditures in respect of the Project (para 4.09);
(b) (i) have the records and accounts for each fiscal year audited, in
accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied,
by independent auditors acceptable to the Association; (ii) furnish to

NATIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
SELECTION AND APPROVAL OF SUBPROJECTS
Selection and approval and clearance of NWMP subprojects 1/ will be as
follows:
(a)  An initial Scheme Summary covering the background to the proposed
scheme, order of magnitude of the investments, and an outline of the
operational issues to be addressed will be prepared in close consult-
ation with the beneficiaries. Following any local discussions and
approvals as may be decided by the State Covernment the Scheme Sumnary
will be presented to the WMC in GOI. The purpose of this summary would
be to obtain preliminary clearance of the proposal and hence confirm
eligibility of detailed preparation costs for financing under the NWMP.
No scheme served by dams with unresolved safety problems will be
accepted.
(b) Following clearance of the Scheme Summary, the State PPMC, working
closcly with the State O&M Cell, the project authorities and other
Departments and Agencies, as appropriate, will prepare a full Scheme
Report in accordance with the guidelines given in Annex 4 of the Staff
Appraisal Report.
(c) State technical and administrative clearance will be by a committee or
committees established at the State level. In Karnataka, a single
committee will be established, chaired by the Secretary II (PW, CAD and
E Dept.) and comprising members drawn from other technical agencies and
coopted scheme level staff. In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, technical
review will be by a committee chaired by a senior ID engineer, and
administrative clearance will be by a committee chaired by the Secretary
Irrigation/PWD.
(d) GOI clearance will be by the NWMP Appraisal Committee in the Ministry
of Water Resources (MWR), chaired by the Additional Secretary, Water
Resources and comprising appropriate officials drawn from the MWR, CWC,
the Ministry of Agriculture, ICAR and appropriate officials from the
concerned states.
(e) IDA approval would be based on the final scheme reports following GOI
clearance. GOI and the States will keep IDA informed of the processing
of scheme proposals.
1/ These procedures will not be needed in relation to the three sub-projects
appraised by IDA during formal appraisal of the NWMP: Rajolibanda Diversion
Scheme in Andhra Pradesh, Vanivilas Sagar Scheme in Karnataka and Sathanur
Scheme in Tamil Nadu.

NATIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
Assumptions for Economic Analysis
Prices and Conversion Factors
1.      General.  The economic prices of major traded agricultural comodities
(at farm gate) were derived from the IBRD world market prices (1985 projected
through 1995) .zpressed in 1985/86 currency values with appropriate adjustments
for freight, haadling, and processing. Nontraded foodgrains and other non-
traded goods and services were brought to a comon basis with the traded goods
and services through the use of conversion factors. Two conversion factors
have been used: (i) Standard (SCF) and (ii) Construction (CCF). Details on
their derivation and use are described below. The opportunity cost of capital
(OCC) was assumed at 122. The exchange rate of US$ 1.0 to Rs 13.0 was used to
convert prices expressed in U.S. Dollars to local currency values.
2.      Standard Conversion Factor.  To measure India's net economic benefits
from the project, the costs and benefits of the project have been evaluated
at world market prices. This requires certain price adjustments, since many
items are not traded in the world markets and the prices of others are affected
by tariffs and trade restrictions. To make them comparable, a SCF has been
applied to the price of nontraded goods. In the absence of trade restrictions,
the SCF can be estimated by using the following formula:
SCF*       X + M
X + Ss + M + Tm
where:
X * export value (f.o.b);
M - import value (c.i.f);
S a subsidies on exports;
T * taxes and duties on imports.
For the period since 1970, this calculation has produced a SCF of 0.86.
However, since this method does not take into consideration quantitative
restrictions on trade, the estimates derived provide only an upper limit for
the SCF.  The Planning Commission recommends that conversion factors of about
0.75 be used for foreign exchanpge and untraded goods in the evaluation of
industrial projects. This estimate is close to the lower limit of the real
SCF, and therefore 0.8 has been used in the economic analysis.

Page  2
3.      Construction Conversion Factor.  The construction of project civil
works requires the use of a misture of equipment, materials, and skilled and
unskilled labor:
(a)     Traded Component:  this component includes capital-intensive
works that require imported materials. Hence a conversion
factor of 1.00 has been used. It is estimated that about 51 of
the construction costs fall in this category.
(b)     Non-Traded Component:  this component includes works that
require skilled labor and locally manufactured materials. Thus
0.80 has been used. These works include about 45% of construc-
tion costs.
(c)     Unskilled Labor:  a ratio of economic to financial wages equal
to that of agricultural labor (67%) has been used for unskilled
construction labor (para 6). Unskilled labor is estimated to
constitute about 50% of the total construction costs.
The weighted average of these conversion factors vould be as follows:
Conversion Factor        Weight
Traded Items                       1.00               0.05
Non-Traded Items                   0.80               0.45
Unskilled Labor                    0.67               0.50
Construction Costs                 0.75               1.00
(weighted average)
Thus, a CCF of 0.75 has been adopted for converting the cost of construction
works from financial to economic prices.
4.      Economic Prices of Commodities.  The economic prices for traded com-
modities such as rice, groundnuts, sugarcane, and cotton were derived by using
border prices in U.S. dollars according to IBRD commodity projections and were
converted to local currency values at the standard exchange rate (Table 1).
The domestic cost components (lo al transport, handling, and marketing charges)
were adjusted by a SCF of 0.80. Analysis of price trends for major nontraded
foodgrains indicates that prices in local markets are close to parity with
prices in the world market, and therefore no adjustments have been made.
5.      Prices of Agricultural Inputs.  Fertilizers have been valued at the
projected world market price. The economic price of seed and miscellaneous
charges has been assumed to approximate their financial price. The economic
price of farm power (bullock pair with operator) was derived from going daily
rental rates, adjusted by the SCF. A summary of economic and financial prices
is presented in Table 17.
6.      Opportunity Cost of Labor.  Monthly farm labor wage rates vary
throughout South India, depending on the opportunities for work nocably related
to the extent of irrigation development in any particular area. They range
from about Rs 6-9 per day in January/February to approximately Rs 8-12 per day
in April/Hay, averaging, say, about Rs 10/day. The trend over the past ten
years indicates that wages have been increasing pari passu with general price



-90-                       Annex 1
Page 3
increases, in spite of substantial productivity gains over the last decades.
Projections of future growth of population and labor supply would also suggest
that real wages are not likely to increase. Consequently, the rate of Rs 10.00
per manday was adopted for the future as well. On the basis of analyses of
seasonal farm labor supply and demand in Indian irrigation projects, the
average economic shadow wage rate is estimated to be 50% to 70% of the average
financial rate. An economic wage rate of Rs 6.70 per manday, or two-thirds of
Rs 10.00, has been assumed in the economic analysis.
Agricultural Benefits
7.      Estimates of crop production yields, inputs, and farm incomes for the
present, "without" and "with" project situations, are based on crop yields and
production input data provided in the individual scheme reports and collected
in the field. Although experience with irrigation projects in India by and
large suggests that increases in cropping intensities to full development are
achieved more rapidly than increases in yields, this is more applicable to new
projects than to existing projects. For the sake of simplic.ty, therefore, and
to avoid arbitrary assumptions that are impossible to substantiate, it is
assumed that agricultural value added, irrespective of the cause (changes in
cropping patterns, intensities, or yields), will be increases by 10% in the
second year and thereafter in six equal steps from years three to eight, except
in the case of garden crops, when a ten-year period is assumed for the "with"
case and a fifteen-year period for the "without" case.
Costs of Irrigation
8.      Investment Costs.  The capital costs of all civil works, including the
cost of roads, communication equipment, charges for engineering and administra-
tion, and physical contingencies were based on 1985 contract rates adjusted by
the CCF. The works to be carried out under the project, being fairly limited,
are arbitrarily assumed to fall equally in the first three years of each scheme
(years 1 to 3) in the ratio 20:50:30.
9.      Operation and Maintenance Costs.  At present, the average budgeted
financial amount varies from Rs 30-60 per ha in Tamil Nadu to about Rs 50/ha in
Andhra Pradesh, to as high as Rs 140/ha in Karnataka (although these estimates
are not entirely comparable). A significant proportion of this amount (up to
80% in Andhra) is absorbed by establishment costs, leaving limited amounts for
actual maintenance works. As a result, most existing irrigation distribution
systems are in need of rehabilitation. Using the estimates given in the
individual scheme reports for the purposes of the economic analysis, an
increase of Rs 96/ha is assumed for the Rajolibunda Diversion Scheme in Andhra
Pradesh, an increase of Rs 80/ha is assumed for the Vanivilas Sagar Scheme in
Karnataka, and an increase of Rs 50/ha for the Sathanur Scheme in Tamil Nadu.
For the project estimates as a whole (Tables 1 to 6), it is assumed that O&M
allocations will rise by Rs 80/ha as a result of the project. Of course, this
would not rule out further increases. Because O&M involves primarly the
employment of unskilled or semiskilled labor, the unskilled labor conversion
factor of 0.67 was applied.

NATIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
Participating States in South India 1/
General
1.      The National Water Management Project (NWMP) focuses on three
southern States (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu) although provi-
sion is made for extending the program on a pilot basis elsewhere in India.
Together, these three States have a population of about 149 M, or 20% of
India's total, and a land area of about 0.6 M ?I . Population density is
substantially higher in Tamil Nadu (395 per km ) than in the other two States
(215 per km ), and this is reflected in a higher urbanization ratio.
Long-term economic growth rates have lagged in Tamil Nadu, and to a less
pronounced degree in Karnataka, although in Andhra Pradesh they have been
marginally higher than the all-India average. Per capita incomes are at the
Indian average in Andhra Pradesh, but are about 5-10% lower in the oLher two
States.
2.      Topography? Climate and Soils.  Together with Kerala, the three
States comprise the southern cone of the Indian Peninsula. The main
physiographic features of the region are the Western Ghats, which run paral-
lel of the Arabian Sea coast; the Deccan Plateau sloping eastward from the
Western Ghat foothills; the discontinuous line of the Eastern Chats, which
are more or less parallel to the Bay of gengal coast; and the coastal
plains--narrow to the west and broad to the east. The major rivers, includ-
ing the Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery, rise in the high rainfall areas of
the Western Chats and flow eastward across the Deccan Plateau, discharging
through extensive deltas into the Bay of Bengal.
3.      Like the rest of India, the region has a tropical monsoon climate.
The Southwest monsoon normally begins in early June, and continues with
breaks until September. It brings high rainfall to the Western Chats,
recharging the main rivers and providing more than 50% of the total rainfall
to the western, central, and northern parts of the region. In contrast, the
southeastern parts (southeast Andhra and much of Tamil Nadu) receive most
of their rain during the Northeast monsoon, which begins in October and
usually extends to the end of December. Much of the interior plateau region
lies in the rain shadow of the Chats and receives a significant proportion
of its annual rainfall from depressions moving in from the Bay of Bengal,
especially during September and October. When these depressions are few and
far between, the region suffers from drought. With the departure of the
southwest monsoon, a cool dry season sets in to the north and east (from
November through February). This is delayet until January/February in those
areas affected by the Northeast monsoon, and is followed throughout the
region by the hot sumer season (March to mid-June).

4.      The major soil groups include heavy black vertisols (notably in the
northern plateau of Karnataka and interior of Andhra Pradesh); red alfisols
(especially in the northwest and southern plateau of Katnataka, the interior
of Tamil Nadu, and on upper slopes throughout the region); alluvial soils in
the deltas and along valley bottoms; and lateritic soils (notably in the
Chats and along ridges).
5.       gLricultural Performance.  Paddy is the principal foodgrain crop in
both Tamil Nadu (where it accounts for 36X of the total cropped area) and
Andhra Pradesh (302), but is relatively less important in Karnataka (10-15X).
In all three States, it is predominantly an irrigated crop and is widely
grown along the rivers, below tanks, and in the delta areas. Yields range
from as high as 5.0-6.0 t/ha where irrigation is secure, to about 2.5-3.0
t/ha where it is uncertain, and about 1.25-1.50 t/ha under rainfed condi-
tions. Sorghum is the major dry land crop in the heavy black cotton soils
where it is predominantly grown as a late kharif crop utilizing residual
moisture. In contrast, cropping on the red soils and vertisols of lighter
texture normally coincides with the rains, and typically comprises finger or
pearl millet. Yields of coarse grains under rainfed conditions range between
0.5 and 1.0 t/ha, although those of hybrids under irrigated conditions may be
substantially higher. Small areas of wheat in the north and maize are also
planted.
6.      Groundnut is the principal oilseed and accounts for about 12.52 of
the total cropped area. Although it is raised mainly under rainfed condi-
tions with yields of no more than 0.5-0.75 t/ha, more and more is being grown
as an irrigated crop, yields of which can rise to 2.0-2.5 t/ha. Sesame,
sunflower, and castor are other significant oilseed annual crops, while
coconut is important along the coasts and in parts of central Karnataka and
Tamil Nadu. Pulses are widely grown in low rainfall areas and on residual
moisture after paddy. Cotton is an important cash crop; it is raised primary
as a kharif crop, and sugarcane is also widely grown under irrigated condi-
tions.
7.      Watfer Resources.  The major rivers flow east from the Western Ghats;
these inclutle the Codavari to the north, the Krishna in the central region,
and the Cauvery to the south. Lesser east-flowing river systems rise in the
rain shadow areas of the Ghats, while west-flowing rivers drop steeply from
the mountains to the sea. Even the major perennial systems are highly
seasonal, wit:h more than 902 of total flows occurring between June-December,
and, like the rainfall, vary greatly from year to year. Irrigation develop-
ment therefore normally involves heavy investment in storage dams.
Groundwater aquifers are normally low yielding and costly to develop, since
the Deccan Plateau is underlain by crystalline rocks. Nevertheless,
groundwater is becoming increasingly important, but is developed mainly by
the private sector through numerous low- yielding dug wells.
8.      Irrigation Potential and Utilization.  The following table summarizes
estimates of the overall potential and utilization of surface and groundwater
resources iiL the region. Although Tamil Nadu has exploited virtually its
entire surface water resourc*s, there is further significant potential in
Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, in particular. Groundwater resources are less
fully utilized, although again Tamil Nadu has exploited a significantly
higher proportion of its potential than the other two States.

9.      Irrigation has been practiced in South India since ancient times.
The Grand Anicut on the Cauvery (dating back two thousand years) and barrages
across the Upper Cauvery and Tungabhadra (constructed more recently by the
Mysore and Vijayanaga kings) are representative of major projects designed to
distribute run-of-the-river flows primarily to support paddy cultivation.
Large tank schemes to store local runoff--again for paddy--have also been
built, but the most widespread and typical developments were the numerous
small village tanks that are intertwined with the life of the people and
serve the community in many different ways.
10.     Subsequent development has greatly expanded the area under
irrigation. Modern projects have made use of large barrages--similar in
design to that of the Grand Anicut--at the heads of the deltas of major
rivers (includin-g the Cauvery, the Krishna, and the Godavari) to help create
productive deltaic agriculture in regions previously susceptible to drought.
At the same time, diversion schemes were constructed further upstream, and
these were followed by major storage dams designed to stabilize main season
cropping and to conserve flood flows for use during the dry season. Many
hundreds of old village tanks were typically absorbed into these new develop-
ments, and their integration into system management presents a continuing
challenge.
11.     The major storage projects undertaken prior to independence were on
the Cauvery (the Krishnaraja Sagar and Mettur dams) and on smaller rivers and
tributaries (for instance, Nizamsagar on a tributary of the Godavari;
Vanivilas Sagar on a tributary of the Tungabhadra; Periyar Dam, which diverts
a west-flowing river eastward into the Vaigai; and dams on the Thambaraparani
and Kodayer in the south). Since independence, however, massive new dams
have been constructed on all the main rivers (including Sriramasager on the
Godavari; Nagarjunasagar, Sri Sailem, Almatti (under construction), and
Narayanapur on the Krishna; Tungabhadra and Bhadra in the Tungabhadra basin;
and Hemavathy in the Cauvery system). In addition, construction of a wide
range of smaller dams and diversion schemes has extended irrigation
throughout the region, and tle introduction of electric and diesel pumps has
led to widespread groundwatei development--despite relatively low-yielding
aquifers--mainly in the private sector.



_99_                        Annex 3
Page 4
12.     As development moved upstream: and massive new areas were brought
under irrigation, the basic imbalance between abundant land and scarce water
became increasingly apparent. Customary rights--which have always contrulled
access to bupplies, partictilarly during the dry season--have therefore been
increasingly formalized and major interstate agreements have come to deter-
mine allocations between states and major projects. The first major agree-
ment dates back to 1924; it was for the Cauvery (this has since lapsed) and
was followed in the 1960s by those established by Tribunal for the Krishna
and Gndavari. Bilateral agreements govern allocations for he Pennar,
Periyar, and other rivers.
13.     In addition to formalizing the rights to water, governments have
responded to water shortages by increasing the efficiency of delivery (e.g.,
by lining canals, improving system controls, etc.) and by placing constraints
on water use. These contraints, in particular, have lead to a movement away
from paddy and other high water-consuming cropa, and toward the extensive
distribution of limited supplies. Although this process has been aided in
recent years by improved financial incentives for cash crops relative to
paddy, there remains a strong perception in the public mind that irrigation
means paddy. As a result, some attempts were made to serve both paddy and
irrigated dry (ID) crops within the same scheme. More recently, however,
projects are being undertaken entirely for ID cropping. In both cases, new
system designs and practices have had to evolve, and it is the complexity of
this movement away from paddy that presen s the major challenge to irrigation
management in the region.
Irrigation Management in South India
14.     Irrigation management practices in South India have evolved from the
supplementary irrigation of paddy during the rainy seasons. Systems were
designed for continuous flow through outlets (except for some rotation to
meet peak transplanting demands) and field channels were not built. Irriga-
tion is often a field-to-field system and farmers or their employees are
responsible for detailed adjustments between farms and fields. 1/ The entire
commandable area is normally cultivated, rainfall is readily retained by the
bunded and flooded paddy fields, and the development of tank and other re-use
mecharisms to exploit surplus runoff can, over time, result in systems that
are highly efficient. Equity is difficult to maintain, however, and upstream
farmers tend to preempt not only any low flows during the monsoon, but also
the limited stored water that may be available for dry season cropping.
Other disadvantages are that fertilizer and farm chemicals may be transported
from field to field and drainage problems are common owing to rather uncon-
trolled water flows through the system.
1/ A joint irrigator (or neergati) may be employed by a group of neighboring
farmers, and he can become very adept at adjusting flows to crop needs,
soil characteristics, and local topography. Typically, he cooperates
well with neighboring neergatis as long as flows are adequate. In the
event of reduced supplies, this cooperation breaks down and those at the
head preempt the fu1l (continuous) flow to safeguard their crops, whereas
those at the tail suffer.



-100-                       Annex 3
Page 5
15.     However, the major disadvantage of this method is that it is
unsuitable for the production of crops other than paddy. Even so, when
ochemes came to be built for other crops, many traditional principles were
retained. In particular, ID systems were Oesigned for continuous flow to the
outlet to serve 1002 of the authorized ("localized") area, and responsibility
for field channel development and management below the outlet was left to the
farmers. To take account of the lower water requirements for ID crops, canal
capacities were designed at a duty I/ (area pet Ar.it. of flow) usually about
double that for paddy. To respond to farmer preference and allow for subsis-
tence requirements, areas were "localized" for paddy as well as ID
crops--sometimes even within the comnand of a single minor--with canal
capacities a function of the relative areas. Finally, and in this respect,
these systems differ from traditional paddy schemes, large areas, even though
commAndable, were often excluded ("non-localized") in order to spread the
benefits to additional villages, and areas were often "localized" only for
kharif or for rabi, with canal capacities sufficient for the limiting season.
16.     These "localization" policies and principles are based on the premise
that the timing and quantity of water required for paddy are quite different
from those required for upland crops. Unfortunately, in many cases, the
operational capability of the system, as originally designed, did not gener-
ate the differential supply that localization implies. Deficiencies in
planning and design are frequently compounded by system deterioration owing
to initial construction faults and inadequate maintenance, and by a failure
to exploit the potential of the physical system even as it exists. Typical
problems have included (i) farmer interventions on a massive scale, which
irrigation staff have found difficult to control; (ii) inequitable and inef-
ficient water allocations, which in part reflect the historical establishment
of customary water rights for different users; (iii) discrimination between
farmers in respect of access to water and crops they can grow, leading to
extensive unauthorized cultivation; (iv) failure to take all potential water
supplies into account in water distribution (rainfall, groundwater, tanks as
well as canal supplies); (v) untimely supplies, with inadequate reference to
crop water requirements, soil moisture, rainfall, etc.; (vi) overissue rather
than careful regulation as operating staff substitute water for management;
(vii) inequitable distribution whereby head-enders obtain excess water to
the detriment cf tail-enders; (viii) failure to program supporting services
and inputs so that farmers will be able to exploit fully the opportunities
created; and (ix) inadequately trained staff and a lack of clear direction
and personnel management.
17.     Despite major achievements in expanding the irrigated area and in
increasing and stabilizing agricultural production, output in many schemes
both in India and South India remains below the targets used to justify the
initial investment and below what would appear to be a realistic objective.
Such problems were recognized at least as far back as the First irrigation
Commission of 1903, and lay behind the launching of the Command Area Develop,
ment (CAD) program in the 1970s. Under this program, CAD Authorities (CADAs)
were established to introduce systematic operations, coordinate irrigation
1/ Duty in India is quoted in most states on the basis of acres/cusec. In
many other countries, the inverse concept of litres/second/hectare is
used.

and agricultural services, and complete physical construction below the
Government outlet. 1/ Although the program has undoubtedly contributed to
these objectives, by focusing below the outlet, it has failed to tackle
pro,blems of main system management, and CADAs have often proved ineffective
as coordinating bodies. Increasingly, therefore, emphaais is being placed on
interventions that tackle the problems of the main system more directly, and
that seek to improve the reliability, equity, and predictability of water
delivered to the Government outlet.
The Bank's Role in South Indian Irrigation
18.     The Bank has been active in each of the States included under the
first phase of the project:
(a) In Andhra Pradesh, three projects 2/ have been completed and a
further major project has recently been approved (the Second AP
Irrigation Project, Cr. Ib5-IN/Ln. 2662-IN, US$140 M/US$131 M).
Although completed projects generally achieved their objectives, the
first AP Irrigation Project (Ln. 1251-IN, US$145 M) had to be refor-
mulated since canal losses were much higher than expected, and the
credit closing date was extended by three years. Major lessons from
this project were the need to make realistic assumptions regarding
water efficiency; the advantages of lining major canals; and the
importance of rethinking water allocation and delivery policies.
These lessons, and those of a management program introduced in the
context of the project, are reflected in the AP II Irrigation
Project, which will construct major new irrigation facilities at two
locations (Sri Sailem and Sriramasagar schemes) and will improve
irrigation management standards in the existing areas of
Sriramasagar.
(b) In Karnataka, the Bank Group has helped finance a time slice of the
Upper Krishna Project (Karnataka Irrigation Project, Cr. 788-IN,
US$126 M), the credit for which has recently closed. The- Bank Group
is also currently supporting a Tank Irrigation Project (Cr. 1116-IN,
US$54 M) to construct about 150 tank schemes throughout Lhe State.
The Karnataka Irrigation project suffered serious delays (because of
recurring procurement problems and the lack of experienced staff),
which adversely affected the planning and implementation of both the
distribution system and command area development. A second-stage
project is under preparation. The Tank Irrigation Project suffered
from serious initial problems, which delayed implementation by two
years. Since then, progress has picked up, although staffing and
1/ Improvements below the outlet were to be financed by credit. This proved
unsuccessful, and Part I works (communal works, including field channels,
drains, etc.) are now financed through a centrally sponsored program with
GOI assistance to the States. Part II works (those on-farm) are still
in principle, normally financed thruugh the banks.
2/ Pochampad Irrigation, Cr. 268-IN, US$39 M, 1972, Godavari Barrage,
Cr. 532-IN, US$45 M, 1975; and AP Irrigation and CAD, Ln. 1251-IN, US$145
M, 1976.



-102-                      Annex 3

staff turnover continue to be problems, and there remains an
imbalance between the construction of headworks and the development
of the command.
(c) In Tamil Nadu, the Bank Group has helped finance two time slices of
modernization programs for the Periyar Vaigai scheme (Cr. 720-IN,
US$23 M, and Cr. 1468-IN, US$17.5 M). The first project broadly
achieved its objective of saving water through a major lining and
modernization program. However, it became clear that this was insuf-
ficient to achieve the full agricultural potential of the area. In
the second project, therefore, major emphasis had been placed on the
complementary management activities needed to ensure full exploita-
tion of the improved physical infrastructure provided. Progress has
been satisfactory, and it appears likely that the project will
achieve its principal objectives. A further project to initiate
modernization of the Cauvery Delta system has been held in abeyance
pending resolution of issues relating to inter-State water
allocations.
Rationale for Selection of the Three Participating States
19.     The selection of these three States reflects past Bank involvement
in water management programs in these States, 1/ the promising results that
have been obtained, and their demonstrated interest in participating in the
project as reflected in the Seventh Five-Year Plan allocations. The three
southern States also share common problems associated with the system of crop
localization (para 2.02), growing water shortages, a past focus on--and
design for--paddy, and a long-term need for crop diversification. The
evidence from programs such as at Nagarjunasagar (para 2.16) suggests that
these circumstances provide a context for achieving significant benefits from
management interventions, and this appears to be born out by the initial
proposals being developed in relation to schemes for inclusion under the
NWMP. However, a facility to support schemes in nonparticipating States is
to be included under the project so that the approach proposed can be
spread--at least on a pilot basis--more widely and in different contexts
elsewhere in India.
1/ Although no separate program has been taken up in Tamil Nadu, water
management issues have been actively pursued in the context of the
Periyar Vaigai I and II Projects (Cr. 720-IN and Cr. 1468-IN/SF.16).

NATIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
Guidelines for the Preparation of a Scheme Proposal
A. Introduction
Background and Objectives
1.      Many medium and major irrigation schemes are operating at below their
potential. Deficiencies can include high operational losses; unreliable and
untimely irrigation supplies; disregard of rainfall and groundwater resour-
ces; and suboptimal cropping calendars. Major investment in rehabilitation
and modernization may be required to rectify the physical situation fully.
Nevertheless, in most cases, important benefits can be obtained through
improved agricultural and operating procedures supported by high-priority but
low-cost infrastructural improvements. Besides providing short-term
benefits, such changes can generate new data and experience and can lay the
basis for further improvements in performance. If at some stage a higher
investment program proves justified, then the earlier experience can help
significantly in defining the additional investments required.
2.      The National Water Management Project (NWMP) i.s designed to promote
this process of continuing improvement in selected schemes. Since no two
irrigation schemes are the same, operational interventions will vary widely
in type and content. These guidelines seek to provide a systematic approach
to the preparation of a scheme proposal for inclusion under the NWMP, but
they must inevitably attempt to cover most eventualities: not all aspects
will be relevant in all cases and deviations will often be necessary. Fur-
thermore, no plan can go further than is justified by the available data and
experience. Attempting, and failing, to meet impossible targets is a major
cause of the difficulties encountered in operating many schemes. The solu-
tion proposed is thus to define realistic goals, establish procedures for
meeting these goals, advise farmers how they will be affected so that they
can arrange their affairs within the plan, and monitor performance as a basis
for further refinement. The aim is not immediate perfection but the initia-
tion of a process that responds to the particular circumstances of each
scheme, leading over time to continuing improvement.
3.      Scheme Proposal.  Once a scheme has been identified for possible
inclusion under the NWMP, the first step would be to prepare a Scheme



-104-
Annex 4
Page 2
Proposal. The Scheme Proposal must contain the following specific informa-
tion, which is required to evaluate the scheme for implementation under the
Credit:
(i) the area to be covered by scheme investments;
(ii) the cost of scheme investments;
(iii) the O&M requirements for each year of the projectes, clearly distin-
guishing between staff charges and works and defining what the
incremental O&M costs will be;
(iv) the training program for scheme level staff;
(v) an economic evaluation demonstrating that the net annual
benefit/total scheme cost is greater than 25X; and
(vi) if any storage dams are involved, a statement of when they were last
inspected, by whom, and whether there are any known dam safety
issues.
The Scope of a Scheme Proposal
4.      A first requirement in the preparation of any plan is to obtain a
basic understanding of the present irrigation system; what its stated objec-
tives are; how these have changed over time; and how system performance is to
be judged in the light of evolving objectives. Once an understanding of the
background to the existing situation has been obtainied, one can consider how
the scheme's basic objectives might be modified, and what interventions are
possible and desirable.
5.      The two steps, analysis of the present system and synthesis of the
proposed interventions, are best done by mathematical modelling. A microcom-
puter water balance simulation model (e.g. SIMUL) based on daily rainfall
will be used for computing scheme water requirements. Using historical data,
the model will provide information on scheme efficiency and effective rain-
fall. Reservoir operation (RESOP) studies should be done on a daily basis if
flow data are available. A minimum 20-year period is desirable for the
simulation. A simple RESOP microcomputer program will be prepared for each
scheme using SIMUL as a subroutine. If conjunctive power generation is
involved, the problem is quite complex and specialist advice will be needed.
6.      The selected interventions represent the Operational Plan.  Within
the framework of the modified objectives, the Plan should present revised
cropping proposals; establish their water requirements; prepare reservoir
operating principles and procedures to meet these requirements within the
constraints of water availability; and set out a detailed water distribution
plan designed to deliver water in accordance with the specified objectives
in a reliable ane timely manner.
7.      Once the Operational Plan has been established, a program must be
prepared to implement the plan. This should cover farmer consultation and



-105-
Annex 4
Page 3
involvement in approval and implementation; additional surveys and investiga-
tions required to finalize proposals; the physical investments required,
including the preparation of designs and estimates; O&M requirements, includ-
ing staffing; the programming of agricultural services in support of the
plan; training requirements; and the staged implementation of the operational
changes. Project cost estimates would also need to be prepared. The area
defined in the project proposal will, when agreed by IDA, be used as the
basis for estimating per ha costs and hence for providing the basis for
limiting project disbursements (allowed against a limit of Rs 2,500 per ha).
8.      Finally, an assessment will have to be made of the impact of the
operational changes on agricultural production and economic welfare. Perhaps
more important than the a priori evaluation is the need to institute a care-
ful monitoring and evaluation program to ensure that the operational changes
are kept under continuing review and, if necessary modified in the light of
actual petformance and evolving circumstances*
The Guidelines
9.      These guidelines deal in turn with:  (i) existing irrigation systems;
(ii) evaluation of past performance; (iii) preparation of an operational
plan; (iv) implementation; and (v) project impact, review, and economic
analysis. Attachment 1 provides a draft outline for a scheme proposal and
Attachmert 2 indicates the supporting information that might usefully be
collected as a first step in preparing a scheme proposal. "Model" scheme
proposals for the Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme in Andhra Pradesh, the
Vanivilas Sagar Scheme in Karnataka, and the Sathanur Scheme in Tamil Nadu
are provided separately to illustrate what form a scheme proposal might
ultimately take (SDV I, Annexes 5, 6, and 7).
B. Existing Irrigation Systems
9.      Following a brief descriptive introduction covering the river basin
of the scheme, its basic physical conditions (climate, soils, topography, and
water resources), socioeconomic factors, and the major Government agencies
and institutions operating in the command, the proposal should:
(a) Describe the original design objectives including:
(i) delivery system and mode of operation, e.g. on/off, supplementary
to rainfall, continuous;
(ii) design duty and accounting for conveyance losses;
(iii) size of command area and chaks;
(ivl cropping pattern for each season;
(v) irrigation intensity;



-106-
Annex 4
Page 4
(vi) any particulars such as committed water supplies to tanks, power
production, water rights, water lifting arrangement, in-line
reservoirs; and
(vii) localization of crops or irrigation seasons.
(b) Describe the development of the existing irrigation scheme includisg:
(i) the actual capacity of the delivery system;
(ii)  the actual size of command area, its evolved cropping patterns,
and irrigation intensity;
(iii)  unauthorized irrigation;
(iv)  the extent to which "localization" or other water allocation
patterns are followed; and
(v) any particulars such as waterlogging, salinity, well irrigation,
etc.
(c) Describe the physical conditions of the irrigation system as it is
found today. Such observations may include:
(i)   the dam or weir - any defects (such as a defective dam) that
reduce water availability;
(ii)   the conveyance system, including erosion, siltation, destroyied
linings or structures;
(iii)   the distribution system, including ti.s condition of the water
courses, field channels, and their structures: and
(iv)   the amount actually spent on O&M in th.?t past 3 years.
C. Evaluation of Past Performance
10.     Physical and socioeconomic conditions determine what is possible in
each case, and Attachment 2 sets out a fairly exhaustive data check
list-cum-questionnaire as a logical framework for the collection of support-
ing information. In practice, the information specified may not always be
available or relevant, and judgment will be necessary in deciding what is
required in any particular case. In evaluating the background to the present
situation, emphasis will need to be placed on how the system has been
designed, managed, and operated and on how prevailing conditions have
affected and constrained system operation. The SIMUL needed will be used in
this analysis. Therefore, the scheme proposal should:
(a) Describe the present operating rules and procedures and how these
have evolved over time. In many cases these will be contained in
Government Orders setting the rules, regulations, and working tables



-107-
Annex 4
Page 5
for operation of the reservoir or weirs (run-of-river systems) and
their canals, covering such issues as:
(i) rules for impounding or diverting river flows;
(ii)  operations for power and irrigation;
(iii) priorities between different subcommands and seasons;
(iv)  limitations on water allocated to specific subcommands;
(v) opening and closing dates for the canals, and closure periods;
(vi)  irrigation duties governing water issues;
(vii) procedures for continuous and for intermittent flow;
(viii) operations during years of water shortage;
(ix)  rules for responding to rainfall;
(z) arrangement for coordination and consultation between farmers; and
(xi)  rules regarding riparian rights.
(b) Establish the overall water balance implied by the present operating
rules ([a] above) and compare this with actual water issues and
allocations. Among questions that might be considered are:
(i) Have design expectations (river flows, storage availability) been
fulfilled, and have actual water allocations been comparable to
those implied by the operating rules?
(ii)  Have water supplies available to the project increased/decreased
in recent years, for what years, for what reasons and what are
future prospects?
(iii)  Has variability of water availability been greater/less than
expected, and how has this affected water issues?
(iv)  How have supplies in years of shortage actually been allocated,
and how does this compare with design expectations?
(v)  Have there been conflicts between different users (e.g. power,
irrigation, flood control, downstream users), and what are likely
future trends and prospects?
(c) Evaluate the performance of the irrigation distribution system in the
light of design intentions. Possible questions include:



-108-
Annex 4
Page 6
(i) How have irrigation issues per unit area compared with design
expectations, and are there significant variations between the
head and tail/along the main canal down the distribution system?
(ii)  Have design canal and offtake capacities proved a constraint, and
how do prevailing capacities compare with design?
tiii) What are the losses at different levels in the system, how do
these compare with design expectations, and what does this imply
for water delivery, especially to the tail ends?
(iv) How well has the system been maintained, and has lack of main-
tenance affected system perfo:imance?
(v) How well have other sources of water (groundwater, tanks,
drainage re-use) been integrated within the canal system, and
what contribution have they made to water availability?
(vi) How closely have specified irrigation schedules, opening/closing
dates, cropping calendars been followed? Have farmers been
willing to irrigate at night if this is required?
(vii) Do the authorities have full control over the system or do
farmers interfere with control structures, canal flows, irriga-
tion schedules? Is there significant irrigation of unauthorized
areas?
(viii) How serious are losses due to runoff, and how effective have
programs been in conserving or re-using such runoff?
(ix)  How well are system operations monitored and what arrangements
are made for regular review and reporting?
(d)  Evaluate the agricultural performance of the scheme.  Among the
questions to be considered are:
(i) How have actual irrigated areas compared to design expectations
and at what locations in the system are there major deviations?
How have canal-irrigated, well-irrigated, tank-irrigated, and
rainfed areag developed over time?
(ii) How have cropping patterns and intensities compared with design
objectives (during kharif, rabi, hot weather) and to what causes
are differences attributable? Are cropping patterns and inten-
sities fairly uniform throughout the system or are there sig-
nificant differences (e.g. due to head/tail problems,
groundwater/tanks, differing soil types, etc.)?
(iii) What information is available on crop yields and production, and
have yields varied according to location, water availability,
soil type, waterlogging status, etc?



-109-
Annex 4
Page 7
(iv) How well have canal deliveries responded to agronomic require-
ments and have they influenced the crops grown, the area
irrigated, the calendar followed, the yields obtained?
(v) Are farmers well-informed about operating procedures, open-
ing/closing dates, irrigation schedules, etc.? How effective
are procedures for involving farmers in determining operating
practice and informing them of decisions taken?
(vi) How have agricultural supporting services performed (extension,
research, credit, input supplies, marketing), how well have they
been programmed to supporu the requirements of the command area,
and how effective has been interagency coordination?
(vii) How effective have support and advisory services been in relating
to OFD works for communal works below the outlet, rotational
sharing of water between farmers, land shaping, and irrigation
practices on-farm?
11.     These questions are a guide to performance evaluation.  Not all will
be relevant or answerable in each case, and no doubt many others will arise
in relation to specific schemes. Judgment will be required concerning the
degree of detail provided and the presentation of the results. During the
course of discussion, conclusions will be reached relating so past perfor-
mance and the nature of possible interventions. Such inter'entiors may range
from relatively modest modifications of existing practice (e.g., to implement
current practices more systematically or to make them more effective), to
major changes in the way the system is operated (e.g., to alter the method of
supply from continuous to intermittent irrigation, allocate water on an area
rather than a crop basis, modify the cropping calendar, or provide for car-
ryover storage requirements, etc.). Whatever is concluded, the modifications
to current practice represent the basis for the revised operational plan.
This first needs to be systematized in the context of the available water
resources and agronomic considerations. Once this is done, an implementation
program must be set out identifying the steps to be taken to make the opera-
tional plan effective, and to ensure that--as it is implemented--it is kept
under continuous review as a basis for further modification and improvement.
D. The Operational Plan
12.     Proposals for a specific scheme must be set within the framework of
the overall policy and institutional framework established by the State
Government. They must also be realistic in terms of the physical and
managetial resources available, responsive to the agronomic and socio-
economic factors affecting crop growth, consistent with the capacity of the
system to deliver water as required, and adapted to the farmers' ability to
irrigate. The SIMUL model will be used as a design tool to evaluate alterna-
tive operating plans. Based on the evaluatior of past performance, the
Operational Plan will normally need to cover the following:



-110-
Annex 4
Page 8
(a) An overall Cropping Plan designed to establish general agricultural
objectives for the scheme. Possible interventions include, but are
in no way limited to the following:
(i) Modification to established priorities between different areas
or subcommands, including authorization or de-registration of
particular areas or types of cultivation (e.g., areas with prior
rights, unofficial encroachments, indirect ayacuts, areas based
on pumping, extension areas, areas with alternative sources of
water, etc.).
(ii)  Changes in rules governing the cultivation of specific crops
(e.g., localization for paddy or light-irrigated crops, preclu-
sion of sugar cultivation, etc.), or the basis for water alloca-
tion (e.g., localization status, areas sanctioned on a seasonal
or longer-term basis, allocation by area with no crop limita-
tion) or in operational practice so as to encourage or preclude
specific cropping patterns, crops or varieties (e.g., intermit-
tent supply to discourage paddy especially on upland soils,
canal closures to preclude perennials except on wells, limita-
tions on the irrigation season to encourage shorter-term
varieties, etc.).
(iii)  Modification to storage utilization or river diversions so as to
alter the balance in water use between seasons or uses (e.g.,
operational rules governing power generation, carryover storage
for an early start to kharif, release of water during kharif,
reduction/increase in rabi/dry season irrigation intensities,
hot weather cropping, utilization of water temporarily available
during scheme development, conjunctive use between canal water
and groundwater, operational response during surplus or
water-short years, etc.)
(iv)  Specification of cropping calendars for all or separate parts of
the command (e.g., issues to the direct and indirect (tank-fed)
ayacuts, opening and closing dates for reservoir and canal
operations, phasing of crop activities (e.g., for paddy--nursery
establishment, puddling/transplanting, crop growth; for other
crops--land soaking, crop growth, special requirements).
(b) An overall Water Utilization Plan based on water availability and
reflecting:
(i)  The water requirements of the proposed cropping plan, taking
into account established rights, effective rainfall, alternative
sources of water, etc.
(ii)  Operational convenience and requirements, recognizing that it
may not be possible to meet demands fully, and that the best
plan is one that satisfies most demands while remaining manage-
able and providing the right incentives to farmers and offi-
cials.



-111-
Annex 4
Page 9
(iii) Variability in supply from year to year, and the need to satisfy
requirements of the proposed cropping plan in a specified
(reasonable) number of years.
(c) Revised Reservoir or Run-of-River Operating Rules, and working tables
(if appropriate) responsive to the proposed cropping plan and
reflecting the water utilization plan, inter alia specifying:
(i)  Procedures and regulations for impounding or diverting water for
the scheme, subject to prior rights and other constraints.
(ii)  Procedures for releasing water to other users (e.g., power),
downstream areas, major canal systems, etc.
(iii) Opening and closing dates for canal operations.
(iv)  Procedures for responding to variable water availability.
{d)  A Water Distribution Plan which, within the framework of the reser-
voir operating rules, or rules governing river diversions, estab-
lishes how water is to be delivered in the system. It should cover
inter alia:
i)  The irrigation schedules to be followed, whether continuous or
intermittent, and whether uniform over the whole command or
varying dependent on the area served (e.g., left bank/ right
bank, indirect/direct ayacut, etc.).
(ii)  If continuous (essentially only for paddy) then, for each period
of crop growth separately considered (nursery, pud-
dling/transplanting, crop growth), the discharge per unit of
land (allowing for system losses) and the number of days to
continue the flow.
(iii)  If intermittent, the rate of flow or discharge, the duration of
each irrigation, the interval between irrigations and the number
of irrigations. These four variables need to be determined
simultaneously in the light of the water available, canal
capacities, and agricultural requirements, and procedures need
to be laid down for establishing how these are to be determined
in response to varying conditions from season to season and year
to year.
(iv)  Procedures for operating canals at less or more than full dis-
charge if this is required by the Operational Plan (it is often
preferable to operate channels either full or not at all).
(v)  Procedures for filling and emptying the canal system, in par-
ticular the main canals, and for making special issues, e.g., to
tanks or for domestic purposes.



-112-
Annex 4
Page 10
(vi) Procedures for responding to rainfall if generally effective
over the whole command or if confined to specific areas.
(vii) Rotational schedules where these are required, including the
grouping of canals for operational convenience and to ensure
relatively constant flows in parent channels.
(viii) Procedures for adapting the rotational schedules and/or the
areas served in response to variable supplies.
(ix) Procedures for distributing water below the Government outlet,
whether the full or partial flow is to be rotated between farms
or groups or farms, and on what basis such distribution objec-
tives are to be achieved (warabundi, rigid shejpali, normal
shejpali, continuous flow, informal arrangements).
(x) Procedures for ensuring conjunctive use for optimum utilization
of all water resources.
13.     The above is not necessarily an exhaustive list of the subjects to be
covered in an Operational Plan. There will often be special features or
requirements relating to a specific scheme. Frequently, it will be desirable
to prepare draft revised Government Orders setting out the "Rules and Regula-
tions" for the operation of the scheme and include these in an annex in order
to ensure that all relevant aspects are covered. Furthermore, the above
discussion has essentially accepted that water supplies to the scheme in
question have been fixed. In practice, these may either decline or increase
depending on developments elsewhere in the river basin, and if, as a result
of basin wide studies or Government decisions, this occurs, then the Opera-
tional Plan may require significant modification.
E. Implementation
14.     Government commitment to the implementation of a revised Operational
Plan would be an initial requirement. Once this has been obtained, an
implementation program would need to be prepared covering inter alia the
following:
(a) Any further surveys and investigations that are necessary before the
proposals can be finalized. These might, for instance, include:
(i) Hydrological studies and analysis.
(ii) Irrigated area surveys to establish the extent of command coming
under canal irrigation. This includes areas under unauthorized
irrigation.
(iii) Further cropping surveys to establish the extent of
well-irrigated and rainfed cropping.



-113-
Annex 4
Page 11
(iv) A physical inventory of the canal system and structures etc. to
establish their present capacities and condition.
(v) Surveys of the extent of waterlogging, salinity, and other
problem areas.
(vi) qwwveys of soil moisture holding capacities to determine irriga-
tion intervals and related aspects.
(vii) Surveys of deep percolation rates of paddy soils.
(b) The Physical Investments and Improvements necessary to support the
revised operational plan. These might include, but would not in any
way necessari'.y be confined to, the following:
(i   Additional control structures and the rehabilita-
tion/modification of existing structures to facilitate intermit-
tent or full supply, or other operational practices. The
hydraulic response to the system must be evaluated at the design
stage.
(ii) Rehabilitation, and, if necessary, modification, of the canal
system, to ensure that the required discharges can be passed.
(iii) Improvements to the drainage system.
(iv) Rehabilitation, and, if necessary, modification, of offtakes,
gates, and outlets to serve the needs of the Operational Plan.
(v) Extension of the canal system to ensure adequate supply (e.g.,
to a 10 ha chak) or to provide for special requirements (e.g.,
feeder channels to tanks).
(vi) OFD works comprising both communal field channels and drains
and land shaping etc.
(vii) Recalibration of existing, and the introduction of new, measur-
ing devices and the provision of such items as rain guages,
current meter, etc.
(viii) Installation of improved communication systems.
(c) The Operation and Maintenance implications of the Operational Plan,
including:
(i) The procedures and steps required to implement the plan (these
may be set out in the revised rules and regulations, inter alia
covering how schedules will be established, how flows will be
maintained and monitored, how communications and reporting, will
be organized, how security and supervision will be improved,
etc.).



-114-
Annex 4
Page 12
(ii) The organizational arrangements and staff responsibilities
associated with the implementation and monitoring of the Plan,
including incremental staff requirements. A detailed review
of staff strength and functions should be provided showing
upgrading and retraining needs.
(iii) Procedures for scheme maintenance, including organizational and
staff implications. The maintenance works done over the pre-
vious 5 years should be examined and the need for incremental
O&M works reviewed.
(d) The programing of Agricultural Services in support of the Plan,
possibly including:
(i) Agricultural 2xtension (e.g., reorganizing extension services
in response to hydrological units, increasing VEW: farm family
ratios, improving linkages between extension and scheme opera-
tions, strengthening irrigation management content of training
programs, etc.).
(ii) Agricultural research (e.g., improved linkages with research
institutionb, farm and cropping trials to respond to operational
plan proposals, etc.).
(iii) Agricultural credit (e.g., scheduling short-term credit in
response to crop requirements, long-term credit for groundwater
development, etc.).
(iv) Agricultural inputs and marketing (complementary scheduling of
supplies, e.g., seeds, and marketing facilities).
(e) Programs for ensuring full farmer information and involvement,
including the steps necessary to organize or strengthen consultative
arrangements.
(i) Meetings with farmers to discuss the proposed changes, involving
revenue, agricultural, and irrigation staff, with modifications
agreed to suit specific situations.
(ii)  Water utilization committees and election of farmers' leaders
on the basis of major subcommands to monitor schedules, convey
problems, ensure understanding, etc.
(iii) Promotion of farmer committees below the outlet to distribute
water, maintain field channels and drains, etc.
(iv) Regular pre-season meetings (e.g., of the CAD Board or Project
Committee) to approve, monitor, and help implement seasonal
changes and programs.

Page 13
(f) Training programs to support the implementation of the Operational
Plan, including training courses and workshops for senior staff,
junior staff, nontechnical staff and farmers.
15.     On the basis of the above, overall project cost tables should be
prepared, requiring the preparation of designs and estimates for the physical
works, estimates of incremental O&M costs, and estimates of the costs of
special programs (e.g. for training). An implementation schedule should be
drawn up taking into account the phasing of project activities, in particular
the need for early completion of surveys and investigations, and the
finalization of designs and estimates. Sometimes it is possible to initiate
operational improvements in advance of completion of the physical works. Not
only should this allow scheme operators to gain experience with the opera-
tional changes envisaged but also can help finalize the exact nature and
location of the physical improvements proposed.
16.     In the longer term, further investments beyond the scope of the NWMP
may be envisaged (see para 1) and, similarly, further operational improve-
ments may be possible once the Operational Plan has been implemented and
experience gained. The implementation program for the NWMP should therefore
be presented in a framework that will indicate how system modernization and
operations might evolve in the longer term.
F. Project Impact and Evaluation
17.     The final section of the scheme proposal should provide as assessment
of the li!-ly benefits to be derived from the implementation of the Opera-
tional Plan, and establish how the impact of the Plan will be monitored as a
basis for continuing review and improvement. This should cover:
(a) An estimation of the likely agricultural impact of the project,
including estimates of likely cropping patterns and intensities
"with" and "without" the project, relating these to probable water
availabilities, and--to the extent possible--estimates of yields and
overall agricultural production.
(b) An assessment of t'e financial impact of the proposed project on
farmer incomes.
(c) Proposals for monitoring the impact of the operational changes on
overall agricultural performance, on a seasonal and annual basis,
including the assignment of responsibilities for euch monitoring
activities and the specifications of the information to be collected
and the reports to be prepared (these should be based on the standard
format to be developed by the State O&M Units).
(d) Proposals for evaluating the impact of the improved operational
practices as a basis for reviewing their effectiveness and for evolv-
ing revised practices if and when required.



-116-                             Annex 4
Page 14
(e) Steps required to establish an appropriate review process to ensure
that the results of the monitoring and evaluation program are fully
integrated in the scheme' s operation.
18.     There will inevitably be considerable uncertainty relating to the
likely impact of the operational improvements. Special circumstances in any
particular year may mask underlying trends, and a full financial and economic
analysis is unlikely to have a very firm basis. Nevertheless, it is impor-
tant to establish standards against which actual agricultural performance can
be judged.  More important than the            evaluation will be the institu-
tion o' the monitoring, evaluation, and review process to ensure that the
operational changes are kept under continuing review and, if necessary,
modified in the light of actual performance and evolving circumstance.
19.     A simple economic analysis should be supplied.  The ERR should be
greater than 15%. If the net annual benefit/total scheme cost is greater
than 0.25 then it may be assumed that the ERR is greater than 15% and no
further analysis need be done.

NATIONAL WATER KANACEMENT PROJECT
Cuidelines for the Preparation of A Scheme Proposal
Data Checklist and Questionnaire
This checklist/questionnaire is fairly exhaustive and attempts to
provide a logical framework for data collection. In practice, the informa-
tion requested will not always be readily available, and in any case not all
items will be equally relevant for each and every scheme. Judgment should
therefore be used in deciding what should be assembled in any particular
case. In some instances, much of the data will already have been compiled
in the form of a full project report (e.g., where the project was fairly
recently constructed or a modernization program has been proposed) or in
special reports oovering specific aspects (e.g., soils, groundwater, system
operations, etc.). Where they are available, copies of these reports should
be provided and answers to the checklist/questionnaire modified accordingly
with reference to the relevant sections of the report. Copies of all Govern-
ment orders and circulars relating to the operation of the scheme should in
all cases be provided as well as where appropriate and readily available,
copies of general legislation and related documents.
Part A (Engineering Data) will normally be completed by the Irriga-
tion Staff (Irrigation Department and/or CADA) and Part B (Agricultural Data)
by the Agricultural Staff (Agricultural Department and/or CADA). Where
relevant, other agenciei may also need to be involved. Some duplication is
involved between to two parts, in particular relating to cropping, reflecting
the need to obtain data that may be collected by both Irrigation and Agricul-
tural staff.
