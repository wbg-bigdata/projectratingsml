NATIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
Induction Training of Irrigation Engineers in Maharashtra 1/
Background
1.      During the decades of the sixties and seventies Indian irrigation
projects were insufficiently prepared. Planning was not complete, the inves-
tigation of alternative development options was inadequate, the designs were
unimaginative, and little attention was paid during the planning and design
stage to the operational implications of the designs chosen. This resulted
in a less than efficient use of scarce financial and watet resources, it has
created serious problems of inequity in command areas, destroyed large areas
of fertile land because of drainage and water logging problems and has disil-
lusioned the politicians on the value of irrigation for agriculture develop-
ment. One of the reasons for this poor performance was the quality of
engineering.
2.      There are serious shortcomings in the present educational background
of irrigation engineers in India. Young engineers who start their profes-
sional life in the service of the Government are not adequately trained in
irrigation disciplines. Their educational background is broadbased civil
engineering. They have been taught irrigation disciplines during their four
years at the universities but only as one of the many civil engineering
subjects of their curriculum.
3.      Employment opportunities for young civil engineering graduates in
India are mainly in government service, although lately, there has been some
demand from the private sector. The number of engineers working in irriga-
tion, outside government services, however, is still very small. Recruitment
by government is usually based on short term work programs and on available
budgets for new construction and O&M. Very few departments have long term
staff development programs or reliable projections of recruitment needs.
4.      For such an unpredictable job market, the engineering student has
to prepare himself for alternative employment opportunities in roads, build-
ings, railways, ports, irrigation etc. When he graduates he knows something
about all these subjects but generally insufficient to be innovative in his
work. After he is recruited by the irrigation service he is trained on the
1/ A preparation report for a Project for Induction Training of Irrigation
Engineers in Maharashtra was prepared by a World Bank Mission
(Dr. Jagdish Narain, Shri Y.K. Murthy, Dr. Karmeli, consultants and G.J.
Tibor) in July, 1983. The report was reviewed by Dr. Jagdish Narain in
May 1986 and appraised by the NWMP Appraisal Mission.

job by his supervisors.  A review of this training indicates that it is
mostly oriented to administrative matters and focussed on the immediate tasks
the young engineer is called upon to do (staking out works, measurement of
quantities, preparing piece-work tenders, etc.). The training is carried out
by engineers whose background is similar to the trainee's. This circle of
unsufficiently qualified undergraduates, trained on the job by engineers with
a similar professional background, must be broken in order to provide the
technical competence required in the future. The best way to improve the
present level of competence in the service is by introducing into the system,
over time, properly trained young irrigation graduates. In time they will
advance in responsibilities and eventually guide the State's irrigation
development program in the next century.
5.      An important constraint for a reform in engineering training is
connected with the training capabilities of the universities and colleges.
Traditionally the universities in India have been isolated from the problems
in the field and have not contributed much to the advancement of the state of
the art. Their curricula is based on standard engineering training texts
with little reference to the problems facing the irrigation sector in the
country. The faculty in the institutions are usually not sufficiently
knowledgable on the practical problems of irrigation and in general are not
up to date with the technological developments abroad. A refocussing of the
curriculum and an upgrading of the faculty is needed.
6.      Modern irrigation has developed into a complex multi-disciplinary
techyiology involving Engineering, Hydrology, Agronomy, Economics, Sociology
and tManagement Sciences, often requiring a systems approach. Traditionally,
the civil engineers of the Irrigation Departments have had the responsibility
to identify, investigate, plan, design, ronstruct, and operate irrigation
projects to public outlets.
7.      The preparation report identified certain areas of weakness in the
teaching of irrigation engineering and related subjects at the graduate and
postgraduate levels.
(a) In Water Resources Development:
Hydrological and Soil Investigations, Data Evaluation, Hydraulics and
Flow Measurements, Project Economics, Operation and Management of
Irrigation Systems and their Monitoring, Project Organization, etc.
(b) In Water Use and Management:
Irrigation Agronomy, Soil Science, Minor Conveyance Network Design,
Water Scheduling, Irrigation Practices on the farmer's field, On-Farm
Works, Farmer Organizations, etc.
8.      After discussions with COI and COM and the consideration of several
alternative ways to improve the training of engineers, it has been decided to
try out an induction training programme for new graduate recruits to the
State Irrigation Department, making use of facilities and infrastructure in



-3-                              ANNEX 15
Page 3
existing training establi3hments in Maharashtra. The program will fill gaps
in the knowhow of the young engineers and provide field training so that they
are adequately equipped for a career in the Department. Candidates for the
Training Program will be engineers recruited directly through the Public
Service Commission and who would normally undergo a probational period of one
year before their confirmation as officers of the Department.
Project Objectives
9.      Traditionally, the teaching of Irrigation courses has been the
responsibility of the Civil Engineering Departments in the univer-
sities/colleges. As such the emphasis has been on the design and construc-
tion of hydraulic structures like dams, weirs and barrages. There has been
little awareness among the teaching faculty that Irrigation Engineering is an
interdisciplinary subject and the ultimate aim is to make use of the water
for irrigated agriculture.
10.     This lack of awareness on the par. of the training institutions may
have contributed to the present unsatisfactory performance of irrigation
projects. Two steps are needed:
(a) Training of a new type of irrigation engineer, who is given a techni-
cally sound training before joining the Service.
(b) Strengthening the professional linkages of the teaching faculties
in the Universities with the engineering, agriculture and water
management communities, to facilitate the transfer of modern technol-
ogy and promote the involvement of the teachers in the problems of
the irrigation sector in the country.
11.     The objective of the Induction Training Program will be to impart an
adequate Irrigation Engineering background to all graduate Civil Engineering
recruits of the Department before the end of their probation period. The
training program will include adv:nced academic training in irrigation
engineering disciplines and practice oriented training in the field including
on-farm development works, irrigation practices, irrigation agronomy and
related subjects.
12.     The Irrigation Department of the Government of Maharashtra recruits
about 60 civil engineering graduates every year. The recruits will be
divided into two groups: (A) Operation and Management Engineers who will
operate, maintain and manage the systems frQm the reservoirs to the
individual farm gates; and (B) Design and Construction Engineers who will
plan, design and build projects. Engineers in group (A) will also be trained
to advise farmers on on-farm works and recommend to them irrigation prac-
tices. Each group will include about 30 officers. Division into two groups
is necessary for logistical reasons, the core training of both groups will be
similar but with slightly different emphasis.



ANNEX 15
Page 4
13.     The program will be made up of three components, each carried ouc in
a different training institution, where most of the necessary infrastructure
exists.
Basic Training: Will ensure chat the recruits obtain an adequate
perspective of Governmental responsibilities and work procedures and
on the inter-relationships between the various Government Departments
engaged in Irrigation Development. This 3-month training is already
given to the recruits at the Engineering Staff College at Nasik, and
will continue basically unchanged in the future. 1/
Technical Training: Will teach the recruits modern irrigation,
technologies and practices, particularly in areas of project plan-
ning, operation of irrigation systems, on-farm irrigation works and
general water use management. The course will be divided into
academic and practice oriented periods and will be given in two
Institutions.
(a) Academic Training at the Indian Institute of Technology
(I.I.T. , Bombay. The one semester Academic Work will fill gaps
in the more classical subjects like Mathematics, Statistics,
Hydraulics, Open Channel Flow, Hydrology, Operations Research,
Computer Science, etc. At present most of these subjects are
not adequately covered in the undergraduate curriculum of the
general civil engineering degree.
Cb)  Practice-Oriented Training at the Water and Land Management
Institute (WALMI) in Aurangabad:  Work at the Institute during
one semester will train the recruits in the operation of Irriga-
tion Projects, in water scheduling, (techniques of supplying
water reliably and at the correct time to the tarm gates), and
in subjects related to irrigated agriculture, including prepara-
tion of land for irrigation, on farm irrigation practices, the
supply of agricultural inputs, efficient water and land use,
etc.
14.     A number of specially designed courses will be given both at I.I.T.
and at WALMI which will relate to specific problems of irrigation in
Maharashtra (black cotton soils; difficult topography, etc.).
15.     The program will be organized so that only one group of trainees
(about 30) will be working in an Institute (I.I.T. or WALMI) at any one time
so that the infrastructural facilities and faculties in the two Institutions
are utilized throughout the year.
1/ Facilities in Nasik, faculty and course material, are considered very
adequate and need no strengthening at present. The project focusses only
on the Technical Training Components in I.I.T. and WALMI.

Course Material, Curriculum and Course Preparation for Technical Trainin8
16.     The newly recruited Class II Officer who is a Graduate of Civil
Engineering, has only a very rudimentary knowledge of irrigation engineering
disciplines such as Hydrometry, Hydraulics and Soils and absolutely no
knowledge on the use of water for irrigation. If he is not from a farming
background, he would know nothing about irrigated agriculture. Both parts
of the Irrigation Engineering discipline 1/ will have to be taught to the new
recruits to prepare them for their tasks in the Department. Teaching the
basic irrigation engineering disciplines needs an academic background with
high quality teaching staff and appropriate laboratories; teaching irrigation
practices and irrigation agronomy, needs work on irrigation projects and
close contacts with farmers.
17.     The two semester technical training will be divided into different
types of courses. One type will teach the young engineer how to carry out
his assignments; for example how to measure flows in rivers and canals, how
to evaluate hydrological or soil data, how to use remote sensing to identify
water logging, how to make statistical analysis, etc The second type of
courses will teach him what to do to solve the problems he will face in his
work.  For example, what irrigation practices should be used for different
crops under various topographical and soil conditions -- what operational
principles should be used in water scheduling, what distribution and control
systems could be used to provide a timely water supply, what are the economic
implications of water stress for the various crops and what are the economi-
cally justified design and Qperational principles which result from that.
Most of the "how to do" material will be taught at !.I.T., most of the "what
to do" material will be taughc and exercised at WALMI. 2/
1/ The Irrigation Engineering discipline has two distinct facets. The first
is the development of Water Resources and their regulation and conveyance
to the consumers, and the second concerns itself with the use of water
by the farmers for agricultural production. The first part encompasses
the following disciplines: Geology, HydroLogy, Soil Science, Drainage,
Agronomy, Engineering Economics, Civil Engineering Design and Construc-
tion, Systems Engineering ant Soil Sciences.  The second deals with
irrigated agriculture, with waLer use on the farm including the various
water delivery systems to the plants, land development, farmer organiza-
tions, etc.
2/ None of the proposed coursets will deal with subjects such as design of
earth and rockfill dams, canal lining practices, management of construc-
tion sites or other design and construction problems which irrigation
engineers face during their career in the Department. The know-how for
these courses is available in the Irrigation Department, not in the
Academic Institutions. These subjects would therefore be taught in the
Engineering Staff Colleges or in Regional Training Seminars as part of
the in-service training program after the Engineers have already acquired
practical experience in the Department.

18.     Most of the course materials will be tailored to aLtual requirements
in the field. To do this one or two completed and operating major irrigation
projects in Maharashtra will be selected for detail performance analysis
during course work. Most of the lectures and course exercise will use field
data collected from these projects.
19.     One group of trainees (Croup A) will focus on project operation and
management problems, che second (Group B) on project planning and design.
20.     The curricula is divided into five major topics (Tables 2.1 and 2.2).
The Basic Science topic, 195 course hours, will provide both a set of
refresher courses, as well as an introduction to subjects necessary for
subsequent courses. It will provide material on Agriculture and Engineering
Economics. The courses on Statistics and Computer Science are required for
the subsequent data analysis and data evaluation subjects. The courses have
been classified depending on the amount of preparation required, Table 4
shows the ratio of course preparation/lecture time.
21.     The second topic is Engineering, it will ptovide 180 course hours for
Group (A) and 195 for Group (B) The eight courses for Group (A) and the
nine courses for Group (B) comprise most of the "how to do" subjects in
Irrigation Engineering. The first five courses are on data collection and
interpretation. The course on Irrigation Agronomy will teach the basics of
irrigated agriculture and provide sufficient agricultural knowledge for
planning, designing and operation of an Irrigation Project.
22.     The third topic is the heart of the course.  It deals with Project
Planning and Design and provides for 240 course hours for Group A and 270
for Group B. Some of the courses will have to be prepared specifically for
the situation existing in Maharashtra. For some of the other courses most of
the available course material available in India and abroad has to be
revised.
23.     The computer game, at the end of the Planning and Design topic will
demonstrate to the Students the importance of a timely and adequate water
supply for the crops, allowing them to experiment with water scheduling and
operational decisions. The economic implications of the decisions are calcu-
lated by the computer and are presented as output. Optimization of network
operation can be exercised.
24.     Once the student has understood the economic value of a reliable
water supply, the stage is set for the next topic and the project exercises
at the end of the semester. Topic 4 is Project Operation and Management (60
hours for Group A and 15 for Group B) and is a logical follow-up to the
computer game. The courses will present various operational procedures to
achieve optimal water scheduling. These operational modes will be coor-
dinated with the course material on conveyance network planning, and would
provide the engineering alternative3 for the various operational performance
requirements.



-7-                                ANNEX 15
Page 7
25.     The teacher will present alternative solutions for project operation
and explain the reasons for the preferred solution. His recommendations will
be based on command area topography, soils, crops, farm size and farmer
organizations. He will explain the planning and design alternatives to
achieve various water use efficiencies.
26.     Project Work in the form of a planning and project operation exer-
cise, at the end of the course, will be based on data from existing irriga-
tion projects in Maharashtra. The data will be used to replan and redesign
an existing irrigation project to varying performance standards. The Exer-
cise will sum up all course material which has been presented to the students
during the course. In the exercise the students will experiment with alter-
native conveyance system layouts and with appropriate operational modes for
each of the layouts. The various network alternatives and operational modes
will be assessed for their performance (water losses in conveyance and opera-
tional reliability including the timeliness of the supplies) and compared
with the existing performance of the projects analyzed. The network alterna-
tives will be costed and economic comparisons made to choose the best design
alternative.
Teaching Methods and Aids
27.     Films (video cassettes) will be prepared for some typical projects in
Maharashtra to familiarize the students, at the start of the course, with the
problems existing in the field. Basic data files on these projects will be
drawn up during course preparation and then used by the students to prepare
their exercises. The film presentation will serve as the connecting link for
the course syllabus with back references made to the problems identified in
the presentation, when teaching the various course subjects.
28.     Some of the courses will be assisted by advanced interactive computer
programs including video tapes or discs which are already available on
specific subjects abroad, or which will be specially prepared for the course.
These courses will enable the students to learn the subjects whilst interact-
ing with the computer, at a speed they are able to absorb the material. The
teacher will supervise the students and will be available to respond to
questions raised by them. Three teaching practices will be used.
- Conventional methods, direct teacher class contacts.
- Video systems in which the material is submitted with the help of
video tapes and supported by teachers, and
- Computer-aided teaching where specific topics will be presented by
computer on an individual student basis to allow for real time online
demonstrations.
29.     In some of the more theoretical subjects, the interactive computer
course may run at two different levels. For outstanding students, more
advanced material will be presented. This will produce course graduates



ANNEX 15
Page 8
which could later be employed on the more sophisticated planning activities
of the department.
30.     The syllabi may undergo changes as experience accumulates over che
first three years of the project. During this period, close supervision of
the program will be required. Supervision would focus on the oerformance of
faculty and the reaction of the students to the course materiai.
31.     Consultants chosen by the Project Authority will assist and advise
the faculty of I.I.T. and WALMI in the preparatior of detailed training
manuals, computer assisted training programo, T.V. course material, project
exercise problems and other teaching aids. It is anticipated that the
sophisticated teaching aids introduced in the program will effectively cap-
ture the student's interest, present the material more clearly and allow
students with different levels of capability to proceed together.
Project Implementation
32.     The project will support training facilities in the Indian Institute
of Technology (I.I.T.), Bombay and in the Water and Land Management Institute
(WALMI) of the Government of Maharashtra. It will construct the necessary
infrastructure (classrooms, laboratories, student and faculty quarters) for
some thirty students, in the two institutions. It will procure laboratory,
audio-visual and computer equipmrnt (one PC workstation for each 2 students)
and other training aids, also transport for moving the students to and from
the field. It will prepare detailed course material for the teachers and
course notes and textbooks for the students, provide audio-visual training
aids (slides, video films, etc.) and programs for interactive computer train-
ing. It will finance the cost of teacher training in the country, and if
necessary abroad, and provide in the first three years of the program, guest
lecturers for specific technical subjects from India and abroad. For a
period of four years it will finance the annual cost of running the courses.
33.     The project will have two distinct stages.  The first, the "formula-
tion" stage, will take approximately one year, and will be devoted to the
construction of infrastructure and the procurement of equipment. During this
stage, teachers in the participating Institutions will be selected and
trained and detailed course material prepared. During this stage slides and
films will be prepared and the location and contents of the field exercises
defined. The entire course material will be closely related to a number of
specific irrigation projects in Maharashtra which will serve as data base and
which will be analyzed as to their present performance during course work.
These projects will also serve as examples on which new planning and project
operation technologies will be explained and exercised.
34.     The second, "implementation" stage will start in year two, after the
first course has been inaugurated and continue for four years. During this
stage, course material will continue to be refined and focussed. During the
first two years of stage two, a number of guest lectures will be given by
expatriate experts.



ANNEX 15
Page 9
35.     Both training institutions (I.I.T. and WALMI) are well established
and have their budgeting and Accounting prccedures. These procedures will be
used for the construction of infrastructure, 3r the procurement of equipment
and transport, and also for the stage two recurring expenditures.  However,
for the preparation of course material, for training teachers abroad and for
providing the expatriate manpower inputs required, an expatriate Consultant
contractor will assist Project Management.
36.     A foreign consultant will be selected to be the contractor for these
services, possibly a reputable University, which kias experience with training
of foreign teachers, and with the preparation of training material, films and
appropriate computer software. About 50 man-months of professional services
are estimated to be required (Table 4). The contractor will be selected
jointly by GOM/GOI and the World Bank in accordance with the World Bank
guidelines on procurement of consultancy services after the technical
capabilities of various foreign Institutions have been evaluated. The
Project will sign a ceiling contract with the contractor for providing course
material, computer programs, short-term experts, guest lecturers and teacher
training abroad. Each of these categories will have detailed yearly work
programs, including F.C. cost requirements. The contract with the consultant
will run for a three-year period to cover stage one, and the first two years
of stage two.  Project Management will decide when and whom to serd for
training abroad.
37.     Project Management will be made up of three tiers:
(i) A Committee of Direction;
(ii) A Management Committee; and
(iii) The Board of Studies.
38.     Since this is a pilot project, and is likely to be repeated in the
future in other States, it is important that the Government of India be
involved in its direction. For this purpose a Committee of Direction will be
established. The Committee will be headed by the Secretary of the Government
of India, Ministry of Water Resources and will have representatives from the
Department of Education, Finance, Economic Affairs of the Government of India
and relevant departments of the Government of Maharashtra. The Committee
will have six members:

deliberation of the Committee.
39.     The training program will be given by two separate and quite inde-
pendent institutions (I.I.T. and WALMI) each with its own professional,
administrative and financial management.  To create the necessary close
cooperation and technical coordination (course scheduling, exchange of
faculty and use of each other's facilities as required), approval of expendi-
tures and budgetting a management group will be put in place in the form of a
Management Committee. The Committee will have six members:

40.     Project Coordinators will be nominated in the two Institutions, a
Professor at I.I.T., Bombay and a Joint Director, at WALMI, to coordinate the
teaching programs, and the use of the facilities in the two Institutions.
41.     A Board of Studies will be set up to advise the Management Committee
in the formulation of the course contents and other professional matters. It
will review the course programs, as they are implemented and from time to
time suggest improvements and modifications. The Board of Studies will be
composed of the following members:

6.  All the Professors in WALMI and
I.I.T. teaching in the program                          Members
7.  Project Coordinator, WALMI                           Member Secretary
8.  Project Coordinator, I.I.T.                              Member
Representatives of the World Bank and the Contractor may be invited to join
in the discussions.
42.     The Management Committee will approve the annual budgets prepared by
the two training Institutions (both capital and recurring costs) and channel
the necessary funds to them. It will establish a small accounting office for
the preparation of reimbursement claims, which will be forwarded to the
Department of Economic Affairs for payment by the Bank.
43.     The Board of Studies will be responsible for project monitoring and
evaluation.  The Board will set up a Project Monitoring and Evaluation cell
consisting of 2 or 3 members and a Secretary. These members and the
Secretary will not be from the faculties of the Training Institutions. The
cell will review: (a) the technical performance of the training program by
setting examinations and tests at the end of each course and by follow up
interviews with the students after they have been working in the Irrigation
Department for (say) 2 years; and (b) review the infrastructural facilities
and make recommendations for changes. The cell will meet at least once every
six months and report to the Board of Studies.
Additional Faculty, Infrastructure and Equipment Required
At I.I.T. and WALMI
44.     The course programs at I.I.T., Bombay and at WALMI, Aurangabad, have
been drawn up so that the available facilities at both the Institutes are
fully utilized and the trainees benefit by the academic strength of the
I.I.T. faculty and the practice oriented instruction at WALMI.
45.     A review of existing infrastructure at I.I.T. and WALMI shows that
some additional buildings (Offices, Class-Rooms and Residential Accommoda-
tion, vehicles, laboratory and office equipment) would be needed for this
project.
Project Costs (Tables la - lh)
46.     The cost estimates are for the minimum infrastructural and equipment
requirements, needed at I.I.T. and at WALMI. In both Institutions facilities
will be provided for 30 students only, on the assumption that only one group
of trainees will be in the Institutions at anyone time. Also, faculty will
be working for the project for two semesters per year in each of the Institu-
tions.

47.     The foreign currency requirements for Consultants assisting the
Project Management, were based on preliminary assumptions with regard to the
required course preparation time. The actual consultant time required for
course preparation will become apparent only after work on this subject has
started.
48.     Total project costs are US$3.1 million with a Foreign Currency com-
ponent of some 40Z. Out of a foreign currency cost of US$1.2 million, about
US$1.1 million will be spent on foreign consultants for course preparation,
textbooks, computer software, visual teaching aids, etc. Even though some of
this material will be specially tailored to the need of Kaharashtra, the bulk
of the course material and teaching aids will be available for use for
Irrigation Engineering training in other Universities and Water and Land
Management Institutes in India.
FinAncins
49.     The Government of Maharashtra will make a provision in its annual
budget for the expenditure to be incurred every year and make funds available
to the I.I.T. Bombay and WALMI, Aurangabad, through the Chief Engineer,
Irrigation Department, Pune. Annual Budget requirements will be prepared in
accordance with programs approved by the Steering committee.
50.     The proposed IDA credit of US$3.1 million would finance 100% of the
project cost.
Procurement
51.     Civil works to be financed under the project would cost approximately
US$1.3 million including all contingencies, engineering and administration.
All works would be let through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB). All LCB
contracts would be let on the basis of standardized documents and procedures
recently developed by GOI's Central Water Commission (CWC) and approved by
the Bank Group.
52.     Vehicles and equipment to be financed under the project would cost
approximately US$0.3 million, all procured locally. Locally procured equip-
ment include vehicles, laboratory and office equipment and some computer
hardware. These types of equipment would need easily available servicing and
supply facilities. There is adequate domestic competition and prices are
highly competitive. Standardized procedures and bidding documents developed
by CWC and approved by IDA would be used for the procurement of this equip-
ment and vehicles.
53.     Procurement of foreign consultants will follow Bank guidelines.  The
contract amount will be about US$1.1 M of which services will comprise
US$0.5 M, purchase of specialist equipment not available in India US$0.4 M
and training costs US$0.2 M. Equipment purchases will be made by prudent
shopping and together with the training program will be subject to prior
approval by the Management Committee.

Project Benefits
54.     Without a new approach to engineering education the Government of
India and the States programs for irrigation development, for the next
decades, (both modernizing existing projects and developing new areas), is
bound to produce unsatisfactory results. Only with a new approach in irriga-
tion staff training can India produce, in one or two decades, the necessary
technical work force to carry out these ambitious programs to the standards
required in the future.
55.     Since 1978 the Bank has embarked on an ambitious in-service training
program for lower level irrigation technicians in some of the major irriga-
tion States, providing funding and advice to Water And Land Management
Institutes (WALMI's). The first of these Institutes was established in
Maharashtra and has become the most successful in-service training estab-
lishments in the irrigation sector in India. It has spread its influence to
neighboring states and countries.  Funding for an additional five Institutes
has already been provided through Bank Projects in other States of India.
To complement the ongoing operation of lower staff training the proposed
project will test a new approach for the education of young Irrigation
Engineers.
56.     The State of Maharashtra and India as a whole, will benefit from the
Project.  It will provide broad-based, multi-disciplinary training in irriga-
tion to engineer recruits joining the Irrigation Department. Training
facilities at WALMI will be expanded to cover additional subjects (project
planning and operation). The added faculty and facilities will also
strengthen I.I.T.'s and WALMI's capabilities to provide additional in-service
training to engineers and other staff of the Department. It will establish a
link between the I.I.T. Bombay and the Irrigation Department, COM, for the
transfer of modern technologies.  Highly qualified I.I.T. professors will
become familiar with the technical problems of Irrigation Projects in
Maharashtra and may in time get involved in R&D and Consultancy work for the
Department.
57.     An important component of the project is the design of the various
training courses, the preparation of textbooks, training manuals and teaching
aids and the training of teachers in the new course material. This component
will provide the foundation of a new undergraduate program in Irrigation
Engineering, planned at the national level.
58.     Feedback on the benefits of training, after the students have started
working in the Irrigation Department, will be provided on a continuous basis
by the Monitoring and Evaluation Cell. This will ena0le Project Management
to make changes in the curricula and to the teaching methods, and should
minimize the risk of project failure.

Contract Negotiations
4.      The following information is given to acquaint you with the manner in
which the Government negotiates a contract with a consulting firm, e.g.
negotiations normally commence on a Monday. and depending on the nature and
size of the assignment. may take from two to five days.
The aim is to reach agreement on all points, with the consultants and
initialling a draft contract by the conclusion of negotiations.
5.      Negotiations commence with a discussion of your proposal, the
proposed work plan, staffing and any suggestions you may have made to improve
the terms of reference. Agreement will then be reached on the final terms of
reference, the staffing and the bar chart, which will indicate personnel,
periods in the field and home office, man months, and reporting schedule.
Once these matters have been agreed, financial negotiations will take place
and will begin with a discussion of your proposed personnel rates which
should be expressed in man months.
6.      The man-month rates are made up of salary, social costs, overhead,
fee or profit, and any premium or allowance paid for overseas assignments.
Forms giving a standard breakdown of field and office rates are attached to
this Supplementary Information and should be completed for staff to be
employed on the assignment. Neither the forms nor any other financial
information should be submitted with the trchnical proposal. These breakdown
sheets will not form part of the contract.-
7.      Review of Man-Month Rates.  The                          is charged with
the custody of government funds and is expected to exercise prudence in the
expenditure of these funds.  The                             is, therefore,
concerned with the reasonableness of a firm's financial proposal and, during
negotiations, expects to be able to review data backing up a consultant's
man-months rates. Consultants submitting proposals for contracts should be
prepared to disclose such data and should accept that their proposed rates
and other financial matters are subject to scrutiny and possible negotiation.
Man-month rate details are discussed below.
8.      Salary is the gross regular cash salary paid to the individual in the
firm's home office. It should not contain any premium for overseas work or
bonus.
9.      Social Costs are the costs to the firm of staff's non-monetary
benefits. These items normally include pension, medical and life insurance
costs, and the cost of a staff member being sick or on vacation. In this
regard, the leave cost for public holidays is not an acceptable social
cost, nor is leave taken during an assignment if no additional staff
replacement has to be provided. Leave in accordance with a firm's leave
policy at the end of an assignment is acceptable as a social cost.



-31-
ANNEX 15
Attachment 1
Page 6
10.     The principles of calculating the cost of leave as a percentage of
basic salary should normally be as follows:
Leave cost as x of salary = 20 x 100
250
It is important to note that leave can only be considered a social cost if
the GOM, ID is not charged for the leave taken.
11.     Overheads are the firm's business costs which are not directly
related to the execution of the assignment, and which will not be reimbursed
as separate items under the contract. Typical items are home office costs
(partners' time, time of senior staff monitoring the project, rent, support
staff. etc.), the cost of staff not currently employed on revenue earning
projects and business promotion costs. During negotiations, data supporting
the last three years' overhead costs should be available for discussion,
together with a detailed list of items making up the overhead and the per-
centage by which each relates to basic salary. The employee base used for
obtaining averages includes temporary employees (i.e., outside consultants).
12.     Fee or Profit.  This should be based on the sum of salary, social
costs and overhead. If any bonuses paid on a regular basis are listed, a
corresponding reduction in the profit element will be expected. Fee or
profit will not be allowed on travel or out-of-pocket expenses unless, in the
latter case, an unusually large amount of procurement of equipment is
required. Consultants should note that under the terms of the contract,
payment will be made monthly against an agreed estimated payment schedule.
Invoices are required for adjustment of previous scheduled payments and are
not required to trigger payment.
13.     Overseas Allowance or Premium is paid by some firms to staff working
overseas. Such allowances are calculated as a percentage of salary and will
not draw overhead or profit. Sometimes by law, overseas allowances draw some
social costs. In this case, the amount of this social cost should still be
shown under social cost, with the net overseas allowance shown separately.
the GOM, ID assumes that for concerned staff, this allowance where paid will
cover home education. etc.; these and similar items will not be considered as
reimbursable costs. Overseas allowances will not be paid for individual
periods of one month or less.
14.     Subsistence Allowance.  This is not included in the mon-month rate,
but iS paid separately and normally in local currency. No additional subsis-
tence is payable for dependents--the subsistence rate will be the same for
married and single team members. The subsistence allowance is usually based
on prevailing UNDP standard rates for the particular country.
15.     Team Members' Remuneration.  It is not expected that the overseas
allowance plus subsistence should cover all of a team member's living expen-
ses in the courtry of assignment, and it is the responsibility of the firm to
inform team members that these allowances are supplemental to their base
salary and they may have to draw from rheir zalqrv from tim--time



-32-
ANNEX 15
Attachment 1
Page
16.     Contracts with Team Members.  Bearing in mind that mon-month rates
are negotiable and that particular attention is paid to proposed overseas
allowances and subsistence, firms are advised against making firm financial
arrangements with prospective team members prior to negotiations.
17.     The GOM, ID reserves the right to audit cost details as part of an
overall contract audit. In this context, if selected for the study, the
consultants will be expected to maintain time and other accounting records
considered necessary to support allocations of salaries and other costs of
the project.
18.     Having selected a firm partly on the basis of an evaluation of per-
sonnel presented in the firm's proposal, the GOM, ID expects to negotiate
a contract on the basis of the experts named in the proposal and, prior to
contract negotiations, will require assurances that these experts can, in
fact, be made available. As the expected date of mobilization is given in
the letter inviting proposals, the GOM, ID will not consider substitutions
after contract negotiations except in cases of unexpected delays in the
starting date or incapacity of an expert for reasons of health. The desire
of a firm to use an expert on another project will not be accepted for sub-
stitution of personnel.
19.     The consultants should note that the contract for this study will be
with GOM, ID.  Payments to the consultants will be made monthly, in accord-
ance with an agreed estimated schedule, assuring the consultants of regular
deposits in local and foreign currency as long as the work proceeds as
planned.  The consultants and their personnel will be exempt from or reim-
bursed for the cost of taxes, duties, fees, levies and other impositions in
india related to:
(a) payments to the consultants or their personnel except Indian resi-
dents in connection with carrying out this study;
(b) equipment, materials and supplies brought into India for the purposes
of carrying out the study provided they are subsequently withdrawn;
and
(c) proparty brought in for the personal use of the consultants' person-
nel, or their dependents provided the property is subsequently
withdrawn.

INDIA
NATIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT
INDUCTION TRAINING OF IRRIGATION ENGINEERS IN MAHARASHTRA
Draft Terms of Reference for Contractor Services
I. PROJECT SETTING
1. Background
During the decades of the sixties and seventies Indian irrigation
projects were inaufficiently prepared, planning was not complete, the inves-
tigation of alternative development options was inadequate, the designs were
unimaginative, and little attention was paid during the planning and design
stage to the operational implications of the designs chosen. This resulted
in a less than efficient use of scarce financial and water resources, it has
created serious problems of inequity in command areas, destroyed large areas
of fertile land because of drainage and water logging problems.
Significant areas of weaknesses in the teaching of irrigation
engineering and related subjects at the graduate and postgraduate levels
exist today specifically in the following fields:
)  In Water Resources Development
Hydrological and Soil Investigations, Data Evaluation, Hydraul-Ics
and Flow Measurements, Project Economics, Operation and Management
of Irrigation Systems and their Monitoring, Project Organization,
etc*
(b) In Water Use and Management
Irrigation Agronomy, Soil Science, Minor Conveyance Network Design,
Water Scheduling, Irrigation Practices on the farmer's field, On-Farm
Works, Farmer Organizations. etc.
2. Project Objectives
The objective of the Project will be to impart an adequate Irrigation
Engineering background to all graduate Civil Engineering recruits of the
Department before the end of their probation period. The training program
will include advanced academic training in irrigation engineerirg disciplines
and practice oriented training in the field including on-farm development
works, irrigation practices, irrigation agronomy and related subjects.



-38-
ANNEX 15
Attachment 2
Page 2
The main objectives of the project are:
(a) To improve the educational background of young Irrigation Engineering
Recruits before they join Government Service to overcome the serious
shortcomings that exist in the present education of irrigation
engineers in India.
(b) To produce detailed course curricula, textbooks, visual training
aids, computer software, etc. for the project; these will also be
available for a new undergraduate program in Irrigation Engineering,
planned at the national level.
The Irrigation Department of the Government of Maharashtra recruits
about 60 civil engineering graduates every year through a competitive
examination held by the State Public Service Commission. These recruits have
completed a broad based Civil Engineering Course. Irrigation Engineering
Courses at graduate level deals mainly with the structures like Dams, major
canals, etc.. but does not include micro distribution network, agronomy,
onfarm use of irrigation. etc. These graduates can easily adopt new techni-
ques and learn modern methods of irrigated agriculture, if they are given a
proper initiation in these fields. The Induction Course proposes to fill
this gap.
The recruits will be divided into two groups: (A) Operation and
Management Engineers who will operate, maintain and manage the systems from
the reservoirs to the individual farm gates, and (B) Design and Construction
Engineers who will plan, design and build projects. Engineers in group (A)
will also be trained to advice farmers on on-farm works and recommend to them
irrigation practices. Each group will includes about 30 officers.
3. Proposed Induction Training Program
The program will be made up of three components, each carried out in
a different training institution, where most of the necessary infrastructure
exists.
(a) Basic Training. Will ensure that the recruits obtain an adequate
perspective of Governmental responsibilities and work procedures and
on the inter-relationships between the various Government Departments
engaged in Irrigation Development. This three-month training is
already given to the recruits at the Engineering Staff College at
Nasik, and will continue basically unchanged in the future.
(b) Technical Training. Will teach the recruits modern irrigation,
technologies and practices, particularly in areas of project plan-
ning, operation of irrigation systems, on-farm irrigation works and
general water use management. The course will be divided into
academic and practice oriented periods and will be given in two
Institutions.



-39-
ANNEX 15
Attachment 2
Page 3
(i) Academic Training at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT).
Bombay. The one semester Academic Work will fill gaps in the
more classical subjects like Mathematics. Statistics,
Hydraulics, Open Channel Flow, Hydrology, Operations Research,
Computer Science, etc. At present most of these subjects are
not adequately covered in the undergraduate curriculum of the
general civil engineering degree.
(ii) Practice-Oriented Training at the Water and Land Management
Institute (WALMI) in Aurangabad. Work at the Institute during
one semester will train the recruits i.n the operation of Irriga-
tion Projects, in water scheduling, (techniques of supplying
water reliably and at the correct time to the farm gates), and
in subjects related to irrigated agriculture, including prepara-
tion of land for irrigation, on farm irrigation practices, the
supply of agricultural inputs, efficient water and land use.
etc.
A number of specially designed courses will be given both at IIT and
at WALMI which will be related to specific problems of irrigation in
Maharashtra (black cotton soils, difficult topography, etc.).
The program will be organized so that only one group of trainees
(about 30) will be working in an Institute (IIT or WALMI) at any one time so
that the infrastructural facilities and faculties in the two Institutions are
utilized throughout the year.
The two semester technical training will be divided into different
types of courses. One type will teach the young engineer how to caxry out
his assignments; for example how to ensure flows in rivers and canals, how to
evaluate hydrological or soil data, how to use remote sensing to identify
water logging, how to make statistical analysis. etc. The second type of
course will teach him what to do to solve the problems he will face in his
work. For example, what irrigation practices should be used for different
crops under various topographical and soil conditions -- what operational
principles should be used in water scheduling, what distribution and control
systems could be used to provide a timely water supply, what are the economic
implications of water stress for the various crops and what are the economi-
cally justified design and operational principles which result from that.
Most of the "how to do" material will be taught at IIT, most of the
"what to do" material will be taught and exercised at WALMI. None of the
proposed courses will deal with subjects such as design of earth and rockfill
dams, canal lining practices, management of construction sites or other
design and construction problems which irrigation engineers face during their
career in the Department. The knowledge for these courses is available in
the Irrigation Department, not in the Academic Institutions. These subjects
would therefore be taught in the Engineering Staff Colleges or in Regional

Training Seminars as part of the in-services training program after the
Engineers have already acquired practical experience in the Department.
Most of the course materials will be tailored to actual requirements
in the field. To do this one or two completed and operating major irrigation
projects in Maharashtra will be selected for detail performance analysis
during course work. Most of the lectures and course exercise will use field
data collected from these projects.
One group of trainees (Group A) will focus on project operation and
management problems, the second (Group B) on project planning and design.
4. Curricula
The proposed curricula are given in Annex 15, Tables 2 and 3.
The curricula is divided into five major topics.
(a)  The Basic Science topic. 1985 course hours, will provide both a set
of refresher courses, as well as an introduction to subjects neces-
sary for subsequent courses. It will provide material on Agriculture
and Engineering Economics. The courses on Statistics and Computer
Science are required for the subsequent data analysis and data
evaluation subjects.
(b) The second topic is kngineering, it will provide 180 course hours
for Group (A) and 195 for Group (B). The eight courses for Group
(A) and the nine courses for Group (B) comprise most of the "how to
do" subjects in Irrigation Engineering. The first five courses are
on data collection and interpretation. The course on Irrigation
Agronomy will teach the basics of irrigated agriculture and provide
sufficient agricultural knowledge for planning, designing and opera-
tion of an Irrigation Project.
(c) The third topic is the heart of the course. It deals with Pro ect
Planning and Design. Some of the courses will have to be prepared
specifically for the situation existing in Maharashtra.  For some
of the other courses most of the available course material available
in India and abroad has to be revised.
The computer game, at the end of the Planning and Design topic will
demonstrate to the Students the importance of a timely and adequate
water supply for the crops, allowing them to experiment with water
scheduling and operational decisions. The economic implications of
the decisions are calculated by the computer and are presented as
output. Optimization of network operation can be exercised.
(d) Once the student has understood the economic value of a reliable
water supply. the stage is set for the next topic and the project

Page 5
ezercises at the end of the semester. Topic 4 is Project Operation
and Management and is a logical follow-up to the computer game. The
courses will present various operational procedures to achieve
optimal water scheduling. These operational modes will be coor-
dinated with the course material on conveyance network planning, and
would provide the engineering alternatives for the various opera-
tional performance requirements.
The teacher will present alternative solutions for project operation
and explain the reasons for the preferred solution. His recommenda-
tions will be based on command area topcgraphy, soils, crops, farm
size and farmer organizations. He will explain the planning and
design alternatives to achieve various water use efficiencies.
Ce? Project Work in tLe form of a planning and project operation exer-
cise, at the end of the course, will be based on data from existing
irrigation projects in Maharashtra. The data will be used to replan
and redusign and existing irrigation project to varying performance
standards. The Exercise will sum up all course material which has
been presented to the students during the course. In the exercise
the students will experiments with alternative conveyance system
layouts and vith appropriate operational modes for each of the
layouts. The various network alternatives and operational modes will
be assessed for their performance (water losses in conveyance and
operational reliability including the timeliness of the supplies)
and compared with the existing performance of the projects analyzed.
The network alternatives will be costed and economic comparisons made
to choose the best design alternative.
5. Teaching Methods and Aids
Films (video cassettes) will be prepared for some typical projects in
Maharashtra to familiarize the students, at the start of the course, with the
problems existing in the field. Basic data files on these projects will be
drawn up during course preparation and then used by the students to prepare
their exercises. The film presentation will serve as the connecting link for
the course syllabus with back references made to the problems identified in
the presentation, when teaching the various course subjects.
Some of the courses will be assisted by advanced interactive computer
programs including video tapes or discs which are already available on
specific subjects abroad, or which will be specially prepared for the course.
These courses will enable the students to learn the subjects whilst interact-
ing with the computer, at a speed they are able to absorb the material. The
teacher will supervise the btudents and will be available to respond to
questions raised by them. Three teaching practices will be used.

- Conventional methods, direct teacher class contacts.
- Video systems in which the material is submitted with the help of
video tapes and supported by teachers; and
- Computer-aided teaching where specific topics will be presented by
computer on an individual student basis to allow for real time online
demonstrations.
In some of the more theoretical subjects, the interactive computer
course may run at two different levels. Four outstanding students, more
advanced material will be presented. This will produce course graduates
which could later be employed on the more sophisticated planning activities
of the department.
The syllabus may undergo changes as experience accumulates over the
first three years of the project. During this period, close supervision of
the program wilt be required. Supervision would focus on the performance of
faculty and the reaction of the students to the course material.
6. Contractors
Contractors chosen by the Project Authority will assisc and advise
the faculty of IIT and WALMI in the preparation of detailed training manuals,
computer assisted training programs, TV course material, project exercise
problems and other teaching aids in modern irrigation technologies and
irrigation planning. It is anticipated that the sophisticated teaching aids
introduced in the program will effectively capture the student's interest,
present the material more clearly and allow students with different levels of
capability to proceed together.
A foreign University will be selected to be the contractor for these
services which has experience in the training of teachers, and with the
preparation of training material, films and appropriate computer software.
The estimated project costs are given in (Annex 15, Tables la-lh)..
The contractor is expected tc provide inputs for course monitoring
and course upgrading, guest lectures and training seminars to be held by his
staff in India over a three years period. These inputs are provisionally
estimated at some 50 man months of professional experts (Annex 15,
Tables 2-4).
Following his selection as the contractor, he will have to discuss
the details of his professional contribution with the Government of
Maharashtra's and the two participating agencies. Adjustments to these
estimates will be made, if necessary.

7. Organization and Management
The project will support training facilities in the Indian Institute
of Technology (IIT), Bombay and in the Water and Land Management Institute
(WALMI) of the Government of Maharashtra. It will construct the necessary
infrastructure (classrooms, laboratories, student and faculty quarters) for
some thirty students, in the two institutions. It will procure laboratory,
audio-visual and computer equipment and other training aids, also transport
for moving the students to and from the field. It will prepare detailed
course material for the teachers and course notes and textbooks for the
students, provide audio-visual training aids (slides, video films, etc.) and
programs for interactive computer training. It will finance the cost of
teacher training in the country, and if necessary abroad, and provide in the
first three years of the program, guest lecturers for specific technical
subjects from India and abroad. For a period of four years it will finance
the annual cost of running the courses.
The project will have two distinct stages.  Tae first, the "formula-
tion" stage, will take approximately one year. and will be devoted to the
construction of infrastructure and the procurement of equipment. During this
stage, teachers in the participating institutions will be selected and
trained and detailed course material prepared. During this stage slides and
films will be prepared and the location and contents of the field exercises
defined The entire course material will be closely related to a number of
specific irrigation projects in Maharashtra which will serve as base and
which will be analyzed as to their present performance during course work.
These projects will also serve as examples on which new planning and project
operation technologies will be explained and exercised.
The second, "implementation" stage will start in year two, after the
first course has been inaugurated. During this stage, course material will
continue to be refined and focussed. During the first two years of stage
two, a number of guest lectures will be given by expatriate experts.
Both training institutions (IIT and WALMI) are well established and
have their budgeting and accounting procedures. These procedures will be
used for the construction of infrastructure, for the procurement of equipment
and transport, and also for the stage two recurring expenditures. However,
for the preparation of course material, for training teachers abroad and for
providing the expatriate manpower inputs requires, an expatriate Consultant
contractor will assist Project Management.
The contractor will be selected jointly by GOM/GOI and the World Bank
after the technical capabilities of various foreign Institutions have been
evaluated. The Project will sign a contract with the contractor for provid-
ing course material, computer programs, short-term experts, guest lecturers
and teacher training abroad.  Each of these categories will have detailed
work programs. The contract with the consultant will run for a three-year
period to cover stage one, and the first two years of stage two. The total



-44-
ANNEX 15
Attachment 2
Page 8
cost of the contract will be divided into yearly foreign currency allocations
for the various activities.  Project Management will decide when and whom to                £
send for training abroad.
Project Management will be made up of three tiers:
(a) A committee of Direction;
(b) A lManagement Committee; and
(c) The Board of Studies.
Since this is a pilot project, and is likely to be repeated in the
future in other States, it is important that the Government of India be
involved in its direction. For this purpose a Committee of Direction will be
established. The Committee will be headed by the Secretary of the Government
of India, Ministry of Irrigation and will have representatives from the
Department of Education, Finance, Economic Affairs of the Government of Ind.a
and relevant departments of the Government of Maharashtra. The Committee
will have six members.
The training program will be given by two separate and quite inde-
pendent institutions (IIT and WALMI) each with its own professional,
administrative and financial management. To create the necessary close
cooperation and technical coordination (course scheduling, exchange of
faculty and use of each other's facilities as required) a management group
will be put in place in the form of a Management Committee. The Committee
will have six members.
A Board of Studies will be set up to advise the Management Committee
in the formulation of the course contents and other professional matters. It
will review the course programs, as they are implemented and from time to
time suggest improvements and modifications. The Board of Studies will be
composed of the participating professors in the training institutions and
representatives of Government of India and Government of Maharashtra. The
contractors professional personnel may be invited to participate in the
deliberation.
The Board of Studies will be responsible for project mornitoring and
evaluation. The Board will set up a Project Monitoring and Evaluation cell
consisting of 2 or 3 members and a Secretary. These members and the
Secretary will not be from the faculties of the Training Institutions. The
cell will review (a) the technical performance of the training program by
setting examinations and tests at the end of each course and by follow up
interviews with the studerts after they have been working in the Irrigation
Department for (say) 2 years; and (b) review the infrastructural facilities
and make recommendations for changes.  The cell will meet at least once every
six months and report to the Board of Studies.
