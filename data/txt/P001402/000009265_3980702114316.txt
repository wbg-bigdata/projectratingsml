A.    Project Description
1.    Project Development Objective and Key Performance Indicators
The development objective of the Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project (APCBP) is
to put in place improved institutional and policy arrangements for the sustainable and efficient
management, financing and delivery of public and private agricultural services in Lesotho. The
project will assist in redefining the Ministry of Agriculture, Cooperatives, Marketing and Youth's
(MOA) core public roles with the view to facilitating increased private sector participation in the
provision of certain agricultural support services and for MOA to become more priority/target
oriented and client responsive. The project is part of a longer-term program to promote
agricultural growth and poverty reduction and the first step in the development objective would
be to build up capacity for planning and program implementation, particularly at the district level.
Evidence of progress in the capacity building program would be measured through an improved
financial management system and disaggregated district accounting system, including improved
planning, improved budget and district worL program procedures, privatization of agricultural
enterprises, implementation of the unified extension service (UJES), improved land legislation,
institutional restructuring of MOA and Public Expenditure Review (PER) on basis of activities
coherenit with newly defined national/district strategies (Annex 1).
2.     Project Components
The proposed 3-year project will lay the foundation for long-term agricultural development
spanning a period of 10-15 years. The project will assist in the implementation of the first most
critical phase of the program, namely the one dealing with the reorientation of MOA's approach
to the delivery of agricultural services and the institutional reform measures which this would
entail. The APCBP has four components which are described in detail in Annex 2, with detailed
cost breakdown in Annex 3. The components are summarized below:

Land Use Planning. This component is designed to
facilitate land policy review, legal and administrative
reform and the strengthening of the institutional capacity
of the Department of Land, Survey and Physical
Planning (DLSPP) for effective land management. This
component will be implemented by the Ministry of Local
Government.
Change Process Management, comprising four sub     Policy,         7.39      51.7      4.07        59.9
components - Institutional Restructuring; Human   institution

Privatization and Divestiture. This component will
support the strategic management of the change process
as a whole focusing on comprehensive reform in MOA at
district and central levels, including institutional
restructuring, developing related policy and systems (e.g.
Human Resource Policy, Financial Management
Systems) and the privatization, market liberalization and
divestiture activities.

3.    Key Policy and Institutional Reforms
The main lpolicy and administrative reforms being sought under the project are rneant to remove
restrictions on marketing and trade of agricultural products, eliminate Government involvement
in price setting and divest commercial activities and enterprises. Price reforms were
implemented for maize and sorghum in 1996, and wheat in November 1997. This process will
eventually cover all the major commodities. The reforms are expected to have Ea major impact on
resource use (land, labor, capital) as producers and consumers face market prices and should
facilitate diversification into areas where Lesotho has a comparative advantage. The key policy
reforms proposed under the Project are outlined in the Letter of Sectoral Policy and in its
Attachments (Annex 8). The divestiture of public enterprises and commercial services is
expected to release human and financial resources for the financing of core public services in
MOA while providing opportunities for increased private sector investment. A schedule of
privatization and divestiture which was agreed at Negotiations, is part of the Letter of Sectoral
Policy.
4.    Benefits and Target Population
The project would contribute to improvements in the policy environment and put in place a more
sustainable and client responsive agricultural support service at the local and district level. In
time this will enable smallholder farmers to better respond to market incentives, and improve the
management of their farm business and incomes.
By assisting MOA to focus on core public fanctions and stimulating the private sector to take on
a bigger role in the provision of these services, it would make the support delivery system to
farmers more efficient and cost effective. In the medium term, as farmers would diversify from
maize by placing more emphasis on higher value crop production, particularly horticulture,
farmers' incomes would rise and it may also lead to increased exports. In the longer-term, a
more effective extension and research system fully integrated with the introduction of private
clinical veterinary services and the improved supply of seeds and planting materials and
operating in a framework of improved land tenure regulations, could be expected to contribute to
an improvement in Lesotho's overall land and water resource management. The potential target
population benefiting from the project would be households whose livelihoods depend mainly on
agriculture, estimated to be 55% of the 229,000 rural households in Lesotho.
5.     Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
Project Implementation and Coordination. The Ministry of Agriculture will have overall
responsibility for the implementation and coordination of the project with the exception of the
Land Management and Administration component which will be implemented by the Ministry of
Local Govermment. While some structural changes to the existing departments of MOA may
occur if the proposed civil service reform takes place (e.g. the department of Youth Affairs could
be moved to another Ministry), it is expected that the change will be gradual and therefore project
implementation would be largely the responsibility of the present key departments in MOA and
districts. While the existing organizational and management structure under the leadership of the
Principal Secretary will provide the overall policy guidance and operational direction for the
project, the actual implementation and decision making will be decentralized to the districts.
Although the Local Government Act of 1996 provides a framework for decentralization and
Local Government reform, the exact modalities are still being formulated. However, local

Country: Lesotho                 Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capadty Building Project
government elections seem to be firmly scheduled for April 1999. Ultimately, all MOA line staff
in the district, including the present District Agricultural Officers, will become responsible to the
District Administrator. Likewise when the District Planning Units and the District Development
Coordinating Committees become fully functional it is clear that the driving force for the
direction and implementation of the agricultural support delivery system will be the district's
local government. The change process approach for the district would therefore be flexible
and involve a "learning-by-doing route" until such time as everyone is on-board with respect
to the exact modalities of the Local Government Reform. The institutional reform of MOA
would be carried out under the project with assistance from a team consisting of local and foreign
staff which would assist management and facilitate the "change process" at both Headquarters
and district level. The team would also provide some back stopping on technical issues,
particularly in the implementation of the UES. It is expected that the facilitating team would be
in place by January 1999.
Intersectoral Coordination. While the present MOA's Management Committee will provide
the agricultural development oversight, there will be need for coordination and direction of the
project at a higher level. Not only does the project need a forum to discuss the specific
repercussions from the Civil Service and Local Government reforms for the organization and
management of MOA, but there will also be a need to discuss issues concerning macro economic
development and funding targets or overlapping functions (particularly regarding land use
planning, environment and rural development matters at the district and village level) between
various Ministries and Agencies. Prior to project effectiveness, an inter-agency steering
committee would be established with balanced representation from government ministries,
private sector and civil society to provide policy level leadership to the sector. The planning unit
of MOA would provide the secretariat.
Accounting, Financial Reporting and Auditing Arrangements. MOA would be responsible
for project accounting and financial reporting in accordance with the Government of Lesotho
Financial Information System (GOLFIS). The GOLFIS system being supported by the IMF,
needs to be improved to accommodate disaggregation of district based budgeting and annual
work plan. Accounting policies and procedures would be upgraded and a unified budget
approach would be introduced in which both recurrent and capital budget estimates would be
disaggregated and based on programs at the "activity level" generated from the districts. Both
MOA and DLSPP would also carry out a Public Expenditure Review no later than one year after
Project effectiveness. In addition, agreement has been reached within Government that proficient
accountants would be deployed at each of the 10 districts. Project accounts will be audited
annually, following international auditing standards, by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.
The auditor's report would cover the project accounts, SOEs and the Special Account and be
submitted to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal year [Annex 2 (a)].
Procurement. The procurement arrangements are outlined in Annex 6 and summarized in
Tables A - C. There are no large packages that will require ICB procedures, most of them will be
other procurement procedures, while the employment of consultants will be processed in
accordance with the Guidelines: "Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers (revised 09/1997)".  To help build capacity for the preparation of procurement
documentation, short-term consultant support will be provided. A similar approach has been
successfully used in an Education Sector Project in Lesotho.

improved systems and processes for monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Overall responsibility
would rest with the Department of Economics and Marketing. The project would include the
following M&E arrangements: (i) preparation of semi-annual progress reports (financial and
administrative sector data); (ii) baseline surveys and project impact assessments based on
performance benchmarks already developed, and including the effectiveness of UES; (iii) semi-
annual donor review; (iv) annual workprograms and budget submissions and reviews; and (v) a
mid-term-ireview about 18 months after project effectiveness. A final project evaluation would
be conducted in year 3 to evaluate lessons of experience and determine need andi readiness for the
second phase of the development program.
B.    Project Rationale
1.    Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) ) Objectives Supported by the Project
CAS document number: 1775 1-LSO               Date of last CAS discussion: 1/26/96
CAS updated and discussed with EXC: 4/27/98
Board presentation of CAS on: 06/04/98
The objectives of the Bank assistance for the next few years are to support Government's strategy
of poverty reduction and its efforts to sustain macroeconomic performance through greater
integration into the sub-regional economy. IThe project will support these CAS goals by: (i)
developing government's capacity through institutional reform and decentralization; (ii)
improving the enabling policy environment, including support for private sector development;
and (iii) promoting a comprehensive approach to natural resource management.
2.     Mlain Sector Issues and Government Strategy
Lesotho is a unique country in that it is landlocked and enclosed entirely by South Africa. Most
of the land is steep (75% >2000m) with little forest or woodland cover, with a severe climate,
including regular droughts and hail. Of its total land area only 9% (<300,000ha) is suitable for
arable agriculture and about 80% is rangelarid which is most suited for extensive livestock
production. A rapidly rising population has put acute pressure on the limited land resource and
as a result overgrazing and soil erosion have become major problems in an already inherently
fragile natural environment. With job opportunities in mining in South Africa declining and with
limited domestic employment opportunities available, poverty is worst in the rural and
mountainous areas. More than 55% of all households are living in these areas and their
livelihood for the next decades to come will be dependent on increasing agricultural productivity,
including livestock, and crop diversification.
Agricultural performance during the past decade has been moderate to poor due to an inadequate
policy framework, weak institutional capacity and land tenure constraints, an uncoordinated
piecemeal approach to agriculture development assistance, combined with adverse natural factors
(erratic rainfall, increasing land degradation etc.). However, the Government has recently
embarked on a program of economic, policy and institutional reform. This program involves the
liberalization of trade and commercial activiity and the privatization of state owned enterprises
and assets. As part of this reform program, Government is also decentralizing t1he delivery of
many of the public services. The recently formulated agricultural strategy by MOA is based on
the following strategies: (i) improving the agricultural policy environment through market
deregulation, divestiture of public enterprises; (ii) private sector development; (iii) land reform

and natural resource management; (iv) increasing beneficiary participation in the design and
delivery of agricultural support services; and (v) capacity building.
3.     Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices
The challenge which will be taken up under the APCBP is how to manage the transition to a more
intensive, diversified and sustainable farming system that can provide employment and higher
incomes for all farmers, including the poor. Managing the transition to a more outward looking,
market related rural economy requires restricting the role of Government to facilitative functions
which are client oriented, the financing of public goods, improving the functioning of factor
markets - (land, water, financial services), and improving productive rural infrastructure (feeder
roads, rural market facilities, small-scale irrigation, range and pasture development, soil and
moisture conservation, etc.). As a first step in improving the enabling environment for
agricultural development, the project would focus on improving the policy environment, and
rationalize and decentralize the public sector's agricultural services system in priority areas such
as extension and research, animal health, marketing facilitation, availability of seed and planting
materials and land use planning. Another strategic choice has been made to underpin the largely
capacity building thrust of the project with some selected support to priority on-farm and
community production activities such as equipment to grazing associations, tree seedling
distribution and planting material production, marketing infrastructure and small scale irrigation.
The access for this support by clients would be subject to defined criteria. The proposed Lesotho
Social Fund Project to be launched in parallel to APBCP will also serve as an instrument for
pursuing decentralized delivery of support services and participatory planning for poverty
reduction.
4.     Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection
Two options were considered: (i) to move directly into an Agricultural Sector Investment
Program (ASIP); or (ii) to undertake either a national or regional type Rural Development
Project. While the initial project preparation by Government was set along the lines of an ASIP
it became rapidly clear that MOA did not have the capacity to take on the ASIP process in one
step, particularly since the outcome of the proposed civil service reform and full agreement on
guidelines on the implementation of the decentralization process was still not clear. Another
critical factor for rejecting to go with the ASIP approach was the lack of institutional capacity in
MOA including the lack of a shared vision and clearly defined long term agricultural
development strategy in an era of fiscal constraints and market liberalization. Hence it was
decided by Government and donors agreed that the first step of the ASIP should be the APCBP
with a more narrow focus on capacity building, defining mission objectives and further policy
reform and strategy development. While there are prospects for rural development type
programs nationally, it was felt that a national thrust beyond the areas covered by the ongoing
Lesotho Highlands Water Project and the proposed Lesotho Social Fund Project, would depend
on lessons learned. However, with APCBP's focus on the decentralization of MOA's public
services and the building up of greater rural stakeholder participation, APCBP could also be
considered as a stepping stone for a national rural development program.

6.    Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design
The ICR of the Land Management and Conservation Project in Lesotho stressed a number of
lessons: (i) programs which seek to rely on local capacity and priority setting and implementation
need flexibility in the design; (ii) implementation at district level should be part of some piloting
to allow for a learning phase and preferably commence first at some selected districts; (iii)
systematic client consultation should take place prior to implementation; (iv) decision-making
should be brought to the lowest level e.g. village development council; and (v) programs of soil
conservation and range management in southern Africa should be modest and undertaken with
care, because there have been few, if any, successful programs. Experience from preparation of
similar ASIP type projects in Zambia, Kenya, Malawi and Mozambique seem to suggest that
issues related to core public functions, public expenditure reviews and institutional reforms are
part of a development process which cannot be resolved overnight and are highly dependent on
local stakeholder commitment and ownership. Most of the above issues have to be resolved first
before embarking on a large agriculture investment program. General experience in the southern
Africa region also shows that the lack of coordination among donors has impeded the process of
learning from experience and has tended to increase the proliferation of projects. These lessons
have been incorporated in the project design and preparation process.
7.     Indications of,Borrower Commitment and Ownership
Over a period of a year all Departments of MOA, and donors, have contributed to the formulation
of a long term agricultural development framework, which is based on a complete
decentralization of agricultural support services, making the services more responsive to the
needs of clients, and improving the enabling environment for private sector development.
While local stakeholder involvement has in the past been sporadic, there are now active reviews
and discussions taking place at the district level seeking client views and contribution to the
above process. The recent economic strategy reports of the three representative districts which
are based on considerable client contribution together with the report "Summary of Progress and
Proposals for the Way Ahead" prepared by MOA's Capacity Building Working Group can be
considered a testimony to Government's ownership of the proposed project. Finally, both the
Principal Secretaries of MOA, and Economic Planning and Manpower Development have
accorded high priority to the development of a 10-15 year agricultural program.
8.    Value Added of Bank Support in this Project
The Bank has acquired substantial experience in Africa in supporting institutional reforms and
capacity building in agriculture, particularly with respect to agricultural support services. Among
the donors in Lesotho, the Bank has also played a leadership role on issues concerning market
liberalization, poverty alleviation, rural development and decentralization. The Bank is therefore
well placed to advise Government and cooperating donors on the merits, options and problems of
this project approach, including a subsequent sector investmnent or rural development programn.

C.    Summary Project Assessments
1.    Economic Assessment
The aim of lhe project is to make the MOA's agricultural support services more responsive to
the needs of its clients and to make these serviices more cost effective. Most of the Ministry's
budgetary resources are devoted to salaries (60%), while half of the remainder are used on
activities wlhich are not necessarily client oriented or form part of MOA's core public support
functions. A case in point, is the Tractor Operations Unit, which although it only services a very
small percentage of the annual crop production area, absorbs around US$1.0 million per year in
operating expenses. There are at least 15 other enterprises that are losing money and which
generate savings if divested. The APCBP resources will be used to facilitate the change process
that is expected to lead to more client responsive services. The incremental resources to be
provided by the APCBP are once-off costs that are meant to be primarily used for facilitating its
decentralization process, including an enabling environment for the process of priivatization of
enterprises and to collaborate with private partners in the provision of extension, research and
input supplly services. It is expected that the benefits of improved client focus will begin to
accrue beyond the 3 year project span of APC'BP. The expected improvements in the quality and
effectiveness of support services and their impact on farm productivity and output cannot be
quantified because of the uncertainties in the response pattern of farmers to concurrent reforms in
pricing and marketing liberalization. However, annual impact assessments to be carried out will
track and quantify the impact ex-post (Annex 4).
2.    Fiscal Impact
The expenclitures under the APCBP amounting to US$14.3 million over the 3 years are mostly
once off costs associated with the transformation process. Less than 5% of project costs are
considered as recurrent expenditures (vehicle and equipment running costs, office expenses).
The proposed Project savings will occur as MOA shifts out of non-core activities through
divestiture (Annex 8), and institutional restructuring. These savings are expected to amount to
about M30-35 million a year once the changes are implemented. This is equivalent to 33 - 38%
of the recurrent budget. These savings will be higher if MOA carries out a functional review
diligently. The functional review is expected to reveal duplication of roles within MOA and
between MOA and other Ministries. It will also help identify peripheral activities within MOA.
Savings generated from the MOA recurrent budget could increase Government's share of
development expenditure financing which currently is about 8%. Overall, the expected direct
savings far outweigh the direct costs of the project (Annex 4).
3.     Technical Assessment
The project's technical basis is sound, having taken into account the lessons of the earlier Land
Management and Conservation Project in Lesotho, the experiences from other Agricultural
Support Services Projects (extension and research), as well as the lessons learned from the
preparation and implementation of the Agricultural Sector Investment Programs in the Southern
Africa Region. While strengthening the main operating systems of the Ministry (financial
management, management information systems and human resource management), APCBP
implementation strategy is based on the decentralization of much of the manageiment and
decision making authority to service delivery units (e.g. planning, extension, research and other
services such as seed supply and veterinary clinical services) at the district level. The reform

Country: Lesotho                   Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
process proposed under the project will be based on realistic strategies for the development of
agriculture within districts based on an analysis of agricultural potential and client needs
assessment. This process which has nearly been completed in three representative districts, and
will be carried out in all ten districts and be completed no later than June 30, 1999, will be further
supported by participatory tools (workshops, study tours, client and village consultation etc.) to
build consensus, commitment and ownership. The sustainability of services will be enhanced
through measures of cost recovery, outsourcing and in some cases full privatization. Particular
emphasis would be given to the outsourcing of extension services, whereby extension delivery
would be increasingly contracted out, rather than delivered by the civil service. The specific
project support for on-farm and community production would complement the UES and are
supportive to the natural resource management and crop diversification goals of MOA's
agricultural strategy.
4.     Institutional Assessment
The project would be implemented by staff of the individual technical departments of MOA.
These constitute the line structure of the Ministry and no new parallel implementing units will be
established. The overall project coordination will remain through the agricultural management
committee, chaired by the Permanent Secretary. A small group of specialists will provide
facilitation and other technical assistance in the "change management process" of the Ministry.
Apart from change process facilitation they would provide support in areas of financial and
human resource management, monitoring and evaluation, privatization and decentralization,
including specific support for extension, research, seed production/supply and animal health
services. Parallel to the support of the Ministry's Headquarters at Maseru, which will have to
deal with issues related to: (i) core functions of the departments; (ii) possible staff retrenchment;
(iii) operating/management systems; and (iv) privatization of MOA managed enterprises, high
priority will be given to develop and strengthen the managerial and implementation capacity at
district level. As the details of local government decentralization unfolds, fine-tuning of MOA's
support services at district level will have to take place, particularly as it relates to local
Government authority and functions.
Another important area of institutional reform is land policy. Current land policy is seen as
inhibiting the development of land markets, constraining natural resource and land management
and is discriminatory against women and discourages non-nationals of Lesotho from holding
land. The project would therefore include a program of activities designed to facilitate land
policy review, legal and administrative reform and to strengthen institutional capacity of the
Department of Land, Survey and Physical Planning for effective land management. GOL agreed
to initiate an authoritative and participatory process of land policy and legislative review
involving broad-based citizen consultation.
5.     Social Assessment
Agriculture extension in certain areas of Lesotho has been using a diagnostic participatory
approach (Production through Conservation Project), which commences with village headmen
workshops over 3-5 days and by using an area team of subject matter specialists using
participatory rural appraisal techniques the group conducts a community needs assessment. The
community and the team, sometimes with specialists participating from other ministries, then
develop plans to achieve stated goals and to identify groups with common interests. The project
is designed to apply these methods as part of the UES throughout the country, which will likely

lead to a greater awareness of and attention to the special constraints faced by farmers, and
particularly women farmers. In the institutional reformn process the gender composition of the
technical field staff will be addressed as the number of households headed by women is higher
than in many other African countries, undoubtedly because of the long tradition of Basotho men
leaving to work in South Africa mines. With the number of Basotho mine workers employed in
South Africa declining, another issue will be toD address their "homecoming" through promotion
of part-time, small-scale farming and livestock activities in Lesotho.
6.    Environmental Assessment
Environmental Category [ I A   [ x] B   []C
Successful agricultural production will depend to a large extent on proper identification and
management of environmental issues. The main issues requiring attention are: (i) climatic
(drought, hail and relative short growing season); (ii) soil erosion and relatively poor soils; (iii)
inadequate forest cover; and (iv) uncontrolled livestock grazing. All these factors are
contributing to the pressing environmental problems associated with increased land degradation
in Lesotho. As part of the preparation of APCBP an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
was carried out, and its report (April 1998) was endorsed by Government. The project has
addressed in its design the most important environmental issues raised in the EIA report. For
example, the content of extension messages will focus on improving the enhancement of
sustained agricultural production by paying more attention to related environmental issues such
as soil erosion, range management and crop and livestock husbandry. This would be
complemenited by agricultural support programs to farmers/communities to enhance soil
conservation, afforestation and natural resource management. The project is also taking up under
the land management component the land tenure issues, as these are considered some of the core
constraints affecting land use. Finally, the project will include technical assistance to establish
improved environmental monitoring between MOA and the National Environmental Secretariat
and provide on the job training on the proposed mitigation measures outlined in the EA report to
MOA staff.

8.    Sustainability
The project is geared toward enhancing the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of public
agricultural support services within the context of constrained fiscal resources and a liberalized
economic environment. Sustainability would be enhanced by: (i) empowerment of communities
to determine their own development priorities and participation in subsequent design and
implementation; (ii) defining the core functions of the public, private and other non-governmental
sectors in agricultural support; (iii) the selective introduction of cost recovery, out-sourcing and
other forms of service commercialization; (iv) improving the planning capabilities and financial
and program management of MOA, including a human resource development plan; (v) donor
collaboration and commitment to support the long-term agricultural development program; and
(vi) commitment of the country towards overcoming environmental constraints and of the
farming community to invest in agricultural diversification.
9.    Critical Risks
The successful implementation of a long-term agricultural sector development program in
Lesotho carries considerable risks, as generally the track record of donor assisted agricultural
projects is poor. However, this is the first time that both Government and donors have been
discussing together an overall agricultural development program and reached agreement on a
phased action plan of which the first phase would concentrate on putting in place institutional
arrangements and operational capacity related to both planning and implementation. By
designing the program in phases and first concentrating on the rationalization and effectiveness
of MOA's support services and emphasizing the capacity building process, it is felt that the
overall risks are minimized, particularly since MOA is willing to commit itself to both the
principles of privatization and decentralization of the agricultural services.

negotiations it was agreed that the CMT would be assigned to MOA no later than January 1,
1999. Other than the CMT, the two first years would require mostly training and stakeholder
consultations. The preparation of bidding documents for civil works and vehicles and equipment
and annual procurement plans will be supported by short term consultants. Detailed annual
procurement plans will be finalized in conjunction with the preparation of the annual work
programs. During negotiations the draft of the Project Implementation Plan was discussed and
will be updated annually as part of the documentation of the Annual Work Plan (para A5). The
main project performance indicators were discussed and agreed during negotiations and form part
of the Deve'lopment Credit Agreement.

3.    The project components are:
(i)    Sector Strategy andManagement This component will help strengthen
analytical capacity for essential policy analysis, build skills and technical expertise in
sectoral planning and budgeting wilh a district focus, develop a functional monitoring
and evaluation system, and introduce an effective management information system. It
comprises three sub-components:
- Policy Analysis;
- Planning and Budgeting; and
- Monitoring and Evaluation.
(ih)    Agricultural Support Services. The component aims at the rationalization,
decentralization and effectiye delivery of agricultural support services, which are client-
oriented and promote production through effective natural resource management. It
comprises four sub-components:
- Extension;
- Technical Services;
- Research; and
- Marketing Facilitation.
(iii)   LandManagement andAdministration. This component aims at a
comprehensive land reform and is designed to facilitate land policy review, legal and
administrative reform and the strengthening of the institutional capacity of the
Department of Land, Survey and Physical Planing. This component will be implemented
b,y the Ministry of Local Government. It comprises four sub-components:
- Land Policy and Legislative Reform;
- Land Administration;
-  Land Information Systems; and
- Land Use Planning.
(iv)   Change Process Management This component will provide for the strategic
management of the change process as a whole and will assist in the management of the
change process focused at a comprehensive institutional reform, including institutional
restructuring, developing related policies and systems (e.g. Human Resource Policy,
Financial Management Systems) and the privatization, market liberalization and
divestiture activities. It comprises four sub-components:
- Institutional Restructuring;
- Human Resource Management;
- Financial Management; and
- Privatization and Divestiture.
B.    Detailed Project Description
L      Sector Strategy and Management (US$1.25 million)
4.    Polcy Analysis. This sub-component aims to strengthen the capacity for basic policy
analysis and strategy development. The Policy Analysis team will: (i) assess impact of the
reform pirocess; (ii) carry out or commission studies on the economic impact of external policy
changes and domestic policy initiatives on agriculture; (iii) prepare an annual review of the "state

Country: Lesotho                      Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
of agriculture" prior to the preparation of the annual budget; and (iv) prepare periodic updates of
the sector strategy. The Annual Sectoral Review will be a synthesis of sectoral economic
performance, analysis of major shocks to the sector and policy response, and an identification of
major issues facing the sector. This work would provide a strategic direction to the preparation
of the rolling and annual budget plans and would provide directions for the annual update of the
district economic strategies. Project support will comprise training, technical assistance and
equipment as well as funds for policy research and dissemination through workshops, seminars
and publications.
5.     Planning andBudgeting. This sub-component aims to strengthen the planning capacity
at the central and district levels. Over the next three years, the planning and budgeting team will
focus on: (i) assisting districts to develop economic development strategies; (ii) assisting districts
to develop workplan and budgets based on needs assessment generated through the unified
extension service (iii) synthesizing economic development strategies and workplan/budgets into a
national rolling development plan and expenditure framework for the sector; (iv) developing
criteria for the determination of expenditure priorities; and (v) incorporating lessons of
experience as identified by the Policy Analysis team and the Monitoring and Evaluation team.
The Project will provide training, technical assistance and other necessary funds.
6.     Monitoring and Evaluation. This sub-component will build capacity in MOA for: (i)
identifying project impact, particularly MOA's client delivery system, and performance
indicators and establish an effective monitoring and evaluation system; (ii) generate essential
sectoral management information (financial and administrative data, activities carried out and
outputs produced in order to contribute to the objectives of the project; (iii) conducting sector
performance analysis by suitable external institution; and (iv) establishing an effective
management information system (including reporting procedures) for different levels of decision
makers. Some of the priority areas for the M&E team will be: understanding the economics of
farming systems in the different agro-ecological zones in the country; tracking implementation of
MOA's programs; and providing impact data to the policy and planning teams. The Project will
provide training and technical assistance, vehicles and equipment.
II.    Agricultural Support Services (US$2.40 million)
7.     This component addresses the core functions of the Ministry of Agriculture. It aims at the
rationalization, decentralization and increased effectiveness of the agricultural service delivery
system in all 10 districts in Lesotho. It consist of four sub-components: extension, research,
marketing facilitation and technical services. Extension is considered the main catalyst of the
agricultural service delivery system. Research, marketing facilitation and specific technical
support complement an effective extension service.
8.     Extension. The four extension approaches currently applied by MOA will be replaced
by one unified extension service (UES). The new strategy for the UES will be based on a
number of guiding principles (incl. multi-disciplinary/multi-sectoral, village/community needs
assessments, empowerment of farmers and organizations, demand-driven and cost-effective) and
will increasingly try to contract out and cost-share services. The UES for each district will be
broadly based on the outcome of the district economic strategic studies which will have to be
completed by June 1999. It will be further defined through the rationalization of the principles in
light of the particular local and district circumstances. UES will be made operational through task

Country: Lesotho                      Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
forces, stakeholder consultations and technical assistance and is expected to be fiilly operational
by June 2001.
9.     Research. The project will include technical assistance in selected areas, and support
some of the operating costs and equipment to undertake priority research activities, following the
establishment of both a clear research agenda by February 1999, and institutional arrangements
by June 1999, including specific roles of extension and research staff pertaining to applied
research carried out on farmers fields.
10.    Technical Services and Marketing Facilitation. The project would also improve the
policy, management and monitoring capacity of the technical services through initer alia (i) a
better definition of governments' support and incentive framework to farmers and communities,
esp. relating to aforestation/conservation related activities, animal health functions, and the
supply of seed and planting materials (for profit making farming activities); (ii) marketing
facilitation; (iii) livestock data base, including its M&E system; and (iv) livestock registration.
11.    The operationalizing of the UES at district level would be assisted by the project through
District Services and Innovation support. Tle project would finance about (US$0.6 million) to
be used for one-off investments or support to activities such as piloting new approaches,
outsourcirng of extension services, and developing farmers' associations.
12.    The project would also provide support through Farming and Community Support
activities assistance in on-farm and community production activities (e.g. equipment support to
grazing associations, tree seedling distribution and seed and planting material production,
marketing infrastructure and small scale irrigation). Access for this support by the districts and
the distribution thereof would be based on the principles ' that all direct material support to
clients would be transparently allocated and subject to defined criteria'. An initial set of criteria
would have to be defined by MOA no later than September 1998 and included in the Project
Implementation Plan and would include criteria such as: sector wide, disbursemrent and
distribution of funding according to national policy, cost sharing principles (cash or kind)
defined, competitive access to funding by districts, consistency and complementarity with the
proposed Poverty Re-formulation Fund (LHWP), coordination with local government and DPU,
M&E and updating of criteria. More detailed criteria governing the specific nature of support to
various activities would emerge from studies mentioned above e.g. aforestation support and
incentive framework. Another aim of this support would be to rationalize and consolidate the
various on-farm and community activities presently provided but hidden under the various sub-
items of MOA's recurrent and development budgets by no later than FY2000.
Im.   Land Management and Administration (US$3.24 million)
13. l,and Management and Administration. Agreement was reached with the Government
on a program of activities designed to facilitate land policy, legal and administrative reform and
to strengthen institutional capacity of the Department of Land, Survey and Physical Planning for
effective land management. The Government agreed to initiate an authoritative and participatory
process of land policy and legislative review involving broad-based citizen consultation. While
the review will proceed in three overlapping phases, it will be viewed as a continuous process and
will not be considered finished until new legislation and administrative guidelines will have been
have been implemented. To facilitate this, the World Bank and other collaborating development
partners undertake to provide requisite financial and technical assistance, including institutional

Country: Lesotho                     Project Tltle: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
capacity strengthening. The Government is eager to complete the outline review process
including preparation of draft legislation within twelve to fifteen months to facilitate
implementation before the end of the project period. The major activities in the proposed
program are summarized in the following sections.
14.   Land Policy and Legislative Reform. This will comprise a review of land policy and
legislation, synthesis of new policy principles and administrative guidelines and drafting on a
new body of land legislation. The Government will prepare detailed work programs and
comprehensive budget estimates to facilitate release of funds and procurement of equipment and
services for each of the phases. The main outputs for the phases will be:
(a)    Report of the Review Commission, incorporating a summary of land issues and
problems, proposals for their solution and suggestions for structural
reorganization of land administration and conflict management;
(b)    White Paper synthesizing normative and legal administrative guidelines and
suggestions of mechanisms for resolution of disputes; and
(c)    Draft land law, implementing regulations, rules and requisite schedules.
15.   LandAdministration. This will comprise capacity building based on diagnostic studies
initiated under DFID Technical Assistance. The Government plans to complete functional
rationalization of all activities relevant to land administration. The main activities will be:
(a)    The Deeds Registry currently in the Law Office and the Land Use Planning Unit
in the Ministry of Agriculture would be integrated into DLSPP during the current
budget year;
(b)    Decentralization of DLSPP and personnel training; and
(c)    Implementation of new business practice and management systems, and cadastral
information systems. Some support would be provided for civil works for the
expansion of office space to facilitate full networking.
16.   Land Information Systems. This sub component will provide enhanced capacity for data
gathering, analysis and dissemination. It will also support development of skills and awareness
seminars. The areas of financing will be as follows:
(a)    Expansion of office space to house additional units and expanded network;
(b)    Various equipment (GIS, cartographic, office);
(c)    Technical assistance and studies in for GIS and agro-climatology; and
(d)    Support for printing and dissemination of maps.
17.   Land Use Planning. This sub component will provide support to both Ministry of
Agriculture and DLSPP. It will comprise strengthening of spatial and physical land use planning
and the development of land use guidelines for district and community use. It will support:
(a)    Technical assistance, studies, training and familiarization tours on land use
planning; and
(b)    Dissemination and training workshops;

IV.   The Change Management Process (US$7.37 million)
18.    The Change Management Process component provides support to the overall realignment
and restructuring of the-Ministry of Agriculture, driven by the decentralization of services to the
districts, focusing on client needs and core public service functions, the Public Service Reform,
the establishment of democratic Local Governments and the privatization of service delivery.
The component consists of four sub-components: institutional restructuring, human resource
management, financial management and privatization and divestiture.
19.   Institutional Restructuring, Privatization and Divestiture. The focus ofthe Ministry of
Agriculture on core functions requires reorientation, restructuring and ultimately a culture of
change to respond more appropriately to the demands of the clients and communities. For this,
the ministry needs support in the following key areas:
(i)    The Unified Extension Stra,tegy. The focus or the core activity of the ministry
will be the UES, fully decentralized and working closely with other line
departments at district level. For the ministry it will be critical to develop an
enhanced understanding of the characteristics of its clients, their needs and the
nature of public services which can genuinely add value in the agricultural
sector. Critical to this will be the information coming out of the district economic
strategies and the district village needs assessments, both forming an integral part
of the UES. Once the demands and needs of the clients are fully reviewed and
are matched with sustainable district public and private delivery systems, the
appropriate functions of the ministry can be defined at both HQ's and the
districts, including the district restructuring requirements. The definition of
functions and the structure of HQ and districts should be completed by the end of
2001. The project will support the ministry in this process through the provision
of technical assistance, equipment and training.
(ii}    Decentralization. The MOA provides currently technical services either through
its technical departments, based in Maseru, or as technical backstopping in the
districts. The ministry is committed to decentralize decision making power to the
districts, decentralize and scale down technical departments in Maseru and
strengthen the planning, budgeting and implementing capacity of the district
offices. Staff which will be transferred require training, infrastrLcture,
equipment, housing and will receive adequate compensation. The project will
assist the decentralization and rationalization of staff through restructuring
support. Principles and procedures on how this support would be
operationalized, would have to be finalized by GOL and agreed by the
cooperating partners, no later than September 1998, through the Project
Implementation Plan.
(iii)   Omusourcing of Exlension and Research Activities to the Private Sector. The
ministry will have to explore the possibility of outsourcing some of its services to
the private sector. By the end of the project period 20% of the extension services
and 20 % of the research program would have to be contracted out to either
private or non-governmental organizations. The project would support this
initially through a one-off activity through District Services and Innovation



Project Appraisal Document                                                       Page 29
Country: Lesotho                      Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
Activity Support. In the medium and longer term Government would finance
outsourcing from the recurrent budget and/or delivery activities would be fully
taken up by the private sector, on a commercial basis.
(iv)   Divestiture of Departments. The rationalization of agricultural teaching
institutions, Lesotho Agricultural College (LAC) and the agricultural faculty of
the University of Lesotho (NUL) should be completed by the end of 1999 with
the transfer of LAC to NUL. In addition, government would review the possible
integration of agricultural research into NUL thereby aiming at a fuller
rationalization of research responsibilities and capabilities. The Land Use
Planning division may be transferred to the Ministry of Local Government and
most of the land use planning functions decentralized to the district planning
units. The project would assist the divestiture of departments through
restructuring support once restructuring issues are finalized.
(v)    Privatization of Enterprises. The ministry intends to privatize 16 government
enterprises like the Technical Operations Unit (TOU), the national abattoir, the
feedlot and others (Annex 8). The list of enterprises should be forwarded to the
Privatization Unit in the Ministry of Finance and by the end of 1999 at least 3
enterprises should have been fully privatized. The schedule for enterprises would
be updated regularly. The project will support privatization of enterprises but
government would establish the principles under which this budget support could
be accessed for this purpose. By the end of the project at least 80% of the
enterprises should have been privatized or removed from the budget of the
ministry.
(vi)   Privatization of Services. Government would privatize the clinical veterinary
services, privatize veterinary drug stores and would have reached a privatization
level of at least 50% for the clinical veterinary services and 100% for the
veterinary drug stores. The project would assist government in the review of the
legal and regulatory framework for the privatization of veterinary services. In
addition, it would assist in the construction of additional clinics in the 2 districts
and the establishment of a basic animal health service through village veterinary
workers in the remoter parts of Lesotho. Village veterinary workers would be
active in at least in 5 of the 10 districts by the end of the project. Finally the
project would also support the development of a legal framework for the
privatization/transfer of woodlots.
(vii)   Local Government Refornm  The establishment of local governments in Lesotho
will require the support of all government ministries at district level. The transfer
of staff to the districts and the establishment of new functional posts would be
pursued and linked to the local government reform and the decentralization of
other ministries. The establishment of district planning units, district
development coordinating committees, district treasuries would require
substantial attention. The development of district economic strategies would
form part of the general district development plan. The project would support the
local government reform with training and workshops for local government
councilors and other officials in agricultural related issues, and would harmonize

Country: Lesotho                     PjoJect Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
the agricultural needs assessrnent and planning procedures of the UES with the
decentralized district planning framework.
(viii)  The elements described above are all parts of the change process and have to be
pursued to arrive at a much leaner, more district-focused and decentralized MOA
organization. The project would support a change process management team,
consisting of both local and foreign advisors. The change team would guide the
ministry through this process by developing strategic plans for t]he change,
establishing communication channels with stakeholders, building ownership and
commitment and proposing new approaches to service delivery and coordination.
In supporting the overall change process the project would support the ministry
with technical assistance, equipment, training, workshops and operating costs.
The TA team would consist of four facilitators of which three vvould operate at
the district (regional) level aind one extension specialist to back stop the three
regional facilitators in the iraplementation of the UES in the ten districts.
20.   Human Resource Management. Human Resource Management in MCIA and the public
Service is weak and will require support from the project. The current staffing situation of MOA
is unclear and would be confirmed by MOA no later than September 1998. As a first step of this
process the "establishment list" would be reviewed and ghost workers eliminated from the
payroll. Future skill mix availability and requirements will be assessed and training support to
assist the ministry's entire human resource (levelopment will be established. The access for this
support would be based on a complete training needs' assessment for MOA, a satisfactory human
resource policy to be submitted to IDA and other donors no later than June 30, 1999, and on an
annual budget to be agreed upon by both government and donors. The project would assist in the
definition of a Human Resource Management Policy and the introduction of a human resource
management system. In addition, the project would also support more effective communication
systems through the provision of equipment, technical assistance and training.
21.   FinancialManagement. The Accountant General and the Ministry of Finance will
recruit/deploy proficient accountants to eac]h district to strengthen DAO's budgeting and
accounting system. Similarly, proficient accountants will be deployed to districts' sub-
accountancies that are currently not having skilled accountants.
22.   MOA in liaison with the ministry of Finance and Economic Planning will disaggregate
budgetary allocations to activities by expanding and enhancing "GOLFIS" capacity. Warrant of
funds will equally reflect disaggregated line item allocations for each activity in the Recurrent
budget. Similarly, the capital budget will also reflect disaggregated allocations on the basis of
activities.. This will ultimately facilitate better control of resources and transparent financial
reporting.

Annex 2 (a)
Financial Management System
Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
1.    Introduction. During the pre-appraisal process of the APCBP, it became apparent that
the state of financial management system in the Ministry of Agriculture, Cooperatives, Marketing
and Youth Affairs (MOA) in particular, and the entire Government (Ministry of Finance - MOF)
in general as well as other operational and decision making structures in the government would
need to be strengthened and reformed. In view of this, it was imperative for the financial
management system to be considered as one of the key areas that would require strengthening
and reformation (decentralization and de-concentration) both at the Headquarters and at the
District level. Based on this situation, the financial management system in MOA and in the other
supporting institutions at the two levels were reviewed at the appraisal mission, with a view to
identifying specific areas that would require consideration for strengthening within the short,
medium to long term. After identification of these areas of weakness, it is concluded that the
system as reviewed is sufficient to meet the financial management and accountability demanded
by the proposed Project.
2.    Budget System. The present budget system in the Government of L esotho (GOL) reflect
a two category budget system, which also follow separate preparation process under two distinct
ministries. The Recurrent Budget (RB) is in principle a functional responsibility of MOF through
the Treasury Department. The Capital Budget (CB), i.e. for investment costs is a functional
responsibility of the Ministry of Economic Planning. The Line ministries, e.g. MOA prepare
consolidated recurrent estimates based on Departments' estimates and submit this to MOF for
review and finalization. Currently, MOA budgeting process is highly centralized, with all the
departments, with the exception of the Extension Department preparing their estimates at the
center (headquarters). The extension estimates are based on district work program and plans. The
District Agricultural Officers (DAO) is responsible for obtaining activity based needs estimated
by each unit for specific activities, which are finally used to derive the district extension recurrent
estimates. These are all submitted through the Field Services Officer at the headquarters,
following which they are consolidated together with the headquarters' own recurrent estimates
(which includes estimates for Maseru District). Unfortunately, however, it is not possible at the
present time to reflect the specific activity based estimates under each district in the recurrent
printed budget of MOA. This is primarily due to the available digit (character) limitation in the
software presently in use in the Government of Lesotho Financial Information System (GOLFIS)
at the Treasury. This is a matter of concern, especially because it limits the extent to which
resources can be matched to specific activities and also make program based budgeting principle
impossible to adopt. Similarly, it would be extremely difficult for the present system to provide a
basis for sound and full accountability of resources employed in the projects by both donors and
the GOL. Perhaps it is this constraint in GOLFIS that has forced MOA to use a one line budget
item in the recurrent budget with a very substantial allocation (counterpart funds) to represent all
sorts of expenditures which can not fit in either of the other specific expenditure items. The
implication of this is that hidden expenditures, (a few of which could be ineligible under the
project) could find their way through this very broad window.
3.    In view of the deficiency of the budget system under the GOLFIS environment, MOA's
Warrant of Funds (WF) have failed to provide breakdown of amounts allocated for specific
activities in a transparent manner. For instance, the WF holder is able to favor certain activities in



Project Appraisal Document                                                       Page 32
Country: Lesotho                       Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
providing them with excess funds, at the expense other equally important activiities, without being
recognized easily. In this regard, it would not be logical to hold the officers responsible for the
implementation of activities on the ground responsible for non-performance. Thte system also
lacks incentives to motivate the officers at t]he implementation level, to effectively program their
work on the ground without an indication oi the size of resources available to th[em.
4.     Capital Budgets under projects are only reflected as aggregate allocations against the
name of the specific project and are not disaggregated according to project activities and for
district wise. It is therefore not possible to attribute specific allocation to any particular district
and activity within the project.
5.     Recommendation andAgreed Next' Step Action(s).
(i)    GOL will as soon as practicable adopt a unified budget approach in which both
recurrent and capital estimates would be based on programs at the activity level,
and evolve upward from the field to the headquarters level withlin the line
ministries;
(ii)    GOL will assign the full responsibility and function of preparing unified national
budget to one specific institution, which will also put in place and manage a
national budgetary control mechanism (e.g. by enhancing capacity in GOLFIS to
make it responsive to user needs especially in a decentralized public service
environment); and
(iii)   Specifically, GOL will ensure the limitation currently in GOLFIS are quickly
fully identified and resolved. Outside technical help should be sought as needed.
6.     District Recurrent Expenditure. The DAO, as the WF holder is responsible for the
recurrent expenditure at the district level in MOA on behalf of the ministry's Principal Secretary.
The DAO has the authority to incur expenditure in accordance with the line items specified in the
WF to procure goods and services required, and to run station. The expenditure has to adhere to
District level procurement guidelines as provided for by the financial regulations of GOL. The
DAO's olfice is also responsible for ensuring that all goods and services are delivered/supplied
and stored in safe custody, before initiating and authorizing payment for the goods/services.
Preparation of all District based payment vouchers and vote book (budgetary) control are effected
at the DAO's office. To facilitate this function, MOA has attached support staff (Accounts
Clerks) to each DAO. The number ranges between 1 and 2 in most cases depending on the
volume of work and area covered in the district.
7.     Payment vouchers once processed at the DAO's office, are presented to the Sub-
Accountancy for payment, usually by drawiing checks in the case of third parties (suppliers) and
for large staff payments (e.g. travel imprest allowance). Each Sub-Accountancy is under the
leadership of a designated Sub-Accountant, who (on behalf of Treasury) is responsible of
approving and effecting all payments for Government Departments which have District based
presence and activities, (e.g. Education, Health, Agriculture, etc.). The Sub-Accountant also
checks the payment voucher against the vote book to ensure the expenditure line item being
charged has sufficient resources to meet the expenditure, and that it is properly charged, before
approving the payment. This is a useful internal control measure, to prevent possibility of warrant
holders overshooting the budget allocation and keeping out any irregular and unbudgeted

expenditure.
8.     Once payments have been effected, the Sub-Accountancy prepares expenditure returns
periodically, and submits them to Treasury (Accountant General) for review and processing of
the reimbursement. The original copy of paid-up vouchers and supporting documents, are used to
support the expenditure returns. One copy of the paid-up voucher is sent back to the originating
department (e.g. DAO), while the third copy is retained at the Sub-Accountancy. Other
Government ministries/departments with no district structures process their payments at the
ministries' headquarters.
9.     Liquidity at the Sub Accountancy's Bank Account, is maintained by the revenue
collections the Sub Accountancy makes within the district, as receipt to the Government. A
substantial proportion of the revenue collected in each district is on account of both Income Tax
and Sales Tax, supplemented by revenue from other varied and minor sources, e.g. licenses, fee,
levies etc. The size, mix and nature of the revenue collected from various sources vary from
district to district. Although all revenue collected at the district level is banked (presumably
intact), it is apparent that the system allows the Sub Accountancy to directly use the collected
revenue for paying of district operational expenses. Under this system therefore, the Sub
Accountancy is only issued with the resulting net financing (cash flow deficit) by the Treasury. In
essence, the system has a number merits and demerits. However, it weakens the financial control
objective, and also increases the risk exposure of public funds. The financial regulations require
the Sub-Accountancy to transfer surplus funds from the district bank account to main Treasury
Account as soon as the balance in the account exceed a certain maximum set by the Treasury (M
100,000). The main areas of weakness in the system are:
(i)    The risk that revenue collections could easily be used to meet petty cash
payments even before it is banked as required;
(ii)    Revenue collections could remain unbanked for unreasonably long period,
thereby risking its safety;
(iii)   If revenue collections are not strictly accounted for and banked soon after being
collected, temptation for the handlers to divert the funds for personal use is
increased substantially;
(iv)   Risk of loosing substantial income from interest earnings on surplus funds for the
government is increased, in the event that large amounts of revenue are collected
and not banked. Similarly, large balances may be retained in the district current
bank accounts in excess of the authorized threshold and for long period i.e.
before it is transferred to the consolidated fund, unless there is close supervision
by Treasury; and
(v)    Risk of encouraging Sub-accountants to adopt poor cash management practices
contrary to the accounting conservative rule of paying creditors only when the
accounts become due, and not earlier, thus taking full advantage of the credit
period.
10    All these weaknesses if not attended to would exacerbate the financial risk on public
funds, especially where regular supervision and evidence of an effective and robust internal audit
is in-existence.

11.   Recommendation andAgreedNext Action(s).
(i)    MOA and Treasury (Accountant General) will recruit and deploy Senior
Accountants to each district by December 31, 1998 to take charge of the
accounting function, and strengthen the financial management and internal
control system in the DAO's;
(ii)    MOA and treasury (Accountant General) will initiate training needs assessment
of all the accounting staff both at Headquarters and at District level inclusive of
the Sub-Accountancies, and develop a strategy for providing relevant training
(inclusive of computer skills) to the accounting staff as needed by March 15,
1999;
(iii)   Treasury (Accountant General) will adopt and instill prudent financial
management practices in the system to ensuring that all revenue collections at
every level are banked intact and transferred periodically (weekly) to the main
Treasury Account (Consolidated Fund);
(iv)   Treasury will also strengthen its supervisory role and beef up capacity in the
Internal Audit Unit to ensure there are regular checks and reviews for the system
in the line ministries and in the districts;
(v)    Treasury to adopt a system of financing district activities by providing cash in
tranches to meet the cash needs indicated in the warrant of funds issued to the
districts by various departments. All subsequent tranches will be based on the
reimbursement principle and subject to district's ability to accounting for the
previous tranche. This will ensure that districts have the incentive to submit their
monthly returns and supporting documentation to facilitate timely preparation of
reimbursement withdrawal ;applications for submission to the donors;
(vi)   MOA will maintain adequaite books of accounts and ensure that these are
regularly compared and reconciled with the entries appearing in the monthly
General Ledger at Treasury under GOLFIS. This will enable MOA to prepare
timely and quality (accurate and detailed) project financial statements for audit
purposes and in compliance with agreements with various donors; and
(vii)  Treasury and MOA will also to mechanize the financial and accounting systems
(processes) both at DAOs' offices and district Sub-Accountancies as well as at
MOA's headquarters. This will help speed up all budgeting and accounting
processes at all levels and help expedite preparation and processing of
accounting data and records for to facilitate timely financial reporting (financial
statements).
12.   Disbursements andAccounting of Donor FundedProjects. For the last few years,
MOA has not had any IDA supported project under its implementation. Also, MOA has also not
been directly involved in the financial administration of other ongoing donor funded projects in
the sector. Consequently, most, and especially the senior accounting staff are not familiar with
procedure for accessing, disbursing and accounting for donor funds. In view of this, it is
recognized that MOA's capacity to process disbursements under the proposed IDA is presently
extremely low, and must urgently be enhanced to cope with the demand. In view of this, it is
desirable for MOA to develop a sustainable strategy within the existing structure with a view to
strengthening the ministry's capacity to effectively manage donor-supported projects over the
next few years. This will prevent and avoid the present practice of establishing unsustainable
donor supported parallel structures in the name of Project Implementation Units (PIU), which
GOF plan to phase out gradually as the on-going projects with such units come to closure.

13.   The present institutional arrangement both at Treasury (Accountant General) department
and Ministry of Finance has invariably created a vacuum between them, which has weakened
Government's position and ability for control and coordination of government projects with
donor aid and external resources. Currently, there is no one single (one stop shop) center that is
effectively overseeing operations and management of donor aided projects. Although the
department of Public Debt and Management exists in MOF, its present function and capacity
does not allow it to play this role in addition to its present function of managing public debt
(domestic and external). In this regard Government has requested IDA for an Institutional
Development Fund (DF) grant to finance the formulation of measures to address these
deficiencies through (i) provision of a systems advisor to upgrade the current GOLFIS including
the interface with other database systems in Finance and Planning and (ii) strengthening the
Public Debt Office in projects disbursement and reimbursement claims where GOL has spent up-
front and recording of grant funded receipts and expenditures including commodity aid currently
not being done.
14.   Similarly, it is proposed that sector line ministries implementing projects with donor
aid/resources should also establish similar units (starting with MOA as a pilot) in the Financial
Controller's Department to perform the following tasks on a full time basis: (i) coordinate
preparation of withdrawal applications; (ii) pursue Special Account payments; (iii) pursue
reimbursement claims with various donors; (iv) manage and keep custody of accounting
documents (especially with regard to SOEs); and (v) be responsible for the preparation of annual
project accounts for audit purposes. This section will be extremely important and useful as donor
funding in projects becomes increasingly large and complex (particularly as the "SIP" concept
becomes the new modus operandi in various sectors).
15.   Recommendation and Next step Action(s).
(i)    At national level, GOL will establish in Treasury under the Accountant General's
portfolio a unit to coordinate and manage all donor aid and external resources in
projects by December 31, 1998.
(ii)   At sector line ministry level, it is also recommended and agreed that donor aid
accounting units will be established under the Financial Controller, thus
strengthening the department by December 31, 1998.
16.   Audit The Project Implementing Agency (MOA) for the proposed project will be
required to maintain adequate books of accounts and record of all financial transactions under the
project in accordance with sound and generally accepted accounting principles. MOA will
prepare annual Project Accounts in compliance with Intemational Accounting Standards and
submit them to the Auditor in accordance with GOL's financial regulations. The Project
Accounts, SOEs and the Special Account will be audited each year by an independent auditor
acceptable to IDA. The Auditor's report on the each of three financial statements will be
fumished to IDA not later than six months following the close of each fiscal year (September 30).
However, the option to use of private independent auditor would be maintained in case of
capacity limitation at the Auditor General's Office.

Economic and Fiscal Impact Assessment
Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
A.    Introduction
1.    MOA has done a great deal of work in developing a long-term agricultural development
strategy. The MOA strategy seeks to increase the focus on growth in productivity and farm
incomes as a means of reducing poverty, enhancing household food security and expanding
employment opportunities. MOA's resources and its public policy making role are important
factors that influence relative farm level incentives and the pattern of resource allocation. The
proposed Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project is a vehicle for changing the way
MOA does business in a manner that increases its ability to deliver services cost effectively. The
analysis below identifies the key issues, and synthesizes proposed actions and expected
outcomes.
B.    Size and Composition of Public Expenditure
2.    MOA aggregate expenditures amount to an annual average of Maloti 160 million (US$32
million) over the last five years in nominal terms. The aggregate sectoral public expenditure as a
ratio of GDP is close to 3.5% compared to 1.5-2.0% for Sub Saharan Africa in the second half of
the 1980s, while the same level of expenditure as a ratio of agricultural GDP is about 60%, and
has not been lower than 25% over the last ten years. Comparable figures for Sub Saharan Africa
are between 9% and 16%. The level of funding is therefore above Sub Saharan Africa norms.
3.    Emoluments account for an average of 60% of total recurrent expenditure (Table 1).
Within district budgets, this ratio is as high as 80% which leaves little room for operational travel
and other field activities.

1997-98                1996-97                 1995-96

01 Emoluments        57,257,000   60.51%     44,342,650   58.89%    38,032,510  60.46%
02 Travel             8,172,301    8.64%      6,200,640    8.24%     5,852,700   9.30%
03 Operating Costs   22,139,860   23.40%     15,841,290   21.04%     15,629,956  24.85%
04 Special Exp.       4,255,140    4.50%      2,495,550    3.31%      1,976,090   3.14%
05 Grants & Subs.     2,798,110    2.96%      6,412,860    8.52%      1,408,800   2.24%
Grand Total          94,622,411    100%      75,292,900    100%     62,900,056    100%
4.    Since 1995/96, the recurrent expenditure has grown by 50% in nominal terms and that
growth has been driven by increases in emoluments (Table 2). Overall civil service increases
were an average of 10% over the same period which suggests that MOA changes were increases
in staffing.

5.    The top three beneficiaries of increases in the MOA budget have been the TOU,
Cooperatives, and Lesotho Agricultural College. Extension, including district budgets, accounted
for 38% of the recurrent expenditure and has grown at about the same rate as increases in civil
service salaries. Within districts, resources are concentrated at District headquarters leaving a
only a small part for financing actual service delivery. In Leribe District for instance, only 18%
of the resources budgeted for the district were available for front-line service delivery. The level
of service delivery to farmers and communities at field level is limited.
C.    Impact on Sectoral Performance
6.    It is not surprising, given the above diagnosis that MOA's expenditures have not had a
discernible impact on agricultural output and productivity and may not have contributed
significantly to the Government objectives of poverty reduction, enhanced food security and
employment generation. Over the last 15 years, agricultural output has declined in absolute terms
while MOA expenditures quadrupled in real terms (constant 1980 Maloti terms).
D.    Prolposed Budget Rationalization amd Fiscal Impact
7.    A key issue has emerged from the analysis of the level and pattern of budget allocations
as to whether MOA could deploy its scarce resources to finance activities which are consistent
with its core objectives of facilitating growth agricultural productivity and output. Two areas of
focus are priivatizable enterprises and Units within MOA that belong to other sectors.
(a)    Privatizable Enterprises and Services. A conservative estimate suggests that
about 14% of MOA's recurrent budget (equivalent to an annual expenditure of
M13 million or US$2.6 million) is accounted for by expenditure on privatizable
enterprises and services. The big ticket items in the 1997/98 budget are: Tractor
Operation Unit (M8.4 million inclusive of staff salaries); Livestock Products
Marketing Services (M2 million); livestock production enterprises run by the
Department of livestock (M2 million); and forestry woodlots, nurseries and state
farms (Ml million).
(b)    Other Units. A further 18% (equivalent to M16.6 million or US$3.3 million) is
for Units in MOA that might Ibetter belong to other sectors. These include but
are not limited to: Lesotho Agricultural College, Cooperatives, and Youth
Affairs. In addition to the above, there are significant, but undocumented
financial transactions between Government and Coop Lesotho, for instance, in

1997/98 there was a transfer of Ml .21 million, while in 1996/97 there were
transfers amounting to M4 million.
8.      On the basis of preliminary analysis, MOA can cut back nearly M30-35 million (33-
38%) out of its recurrent budget. The Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project provides
a means for MOA to re-orient its priorities to focus on core activities and divest those areas that
do not directly support its core mission.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
A.    Procurement
1.    All procurement of goods and works would be done in accordance with "Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD and IDA Credits". The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for goods
and works would be used. All procurement of consultants would be done in accordance with
"Guidelines, Selection, and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers". A draft
GPN was cleared by the Borrower during Negotiations and will be published in the Development
Forum at least 60 days prior to issue of bid documents. Specific Procurement Notices will be
required for consulting service contracts above US$200,000 prior to the preparation of the
shortlist.
(a)    Civil Works. All civil works contracts for construction and rehabilitation of field
offices and housing facilities will be carried out by NCB or other procurement
procedures.
(b)    Goods and Equipment. Expected procurement will comprise vehicles,
motorcycles, furniture, office equipment, laboratory equipment, communications
equipment, computer hardware and software, and selected consumables.
Purchases will be through ICB, NCB and other procurement procedures.
(c)    Services. This category includes consulting services, technical assistance,
training, studies and tours. All consultant service contracts will be procured in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines for Selection and Employment of
Consultants (updated September 1997). Most consultants will be recruited
through competition among qualified short-listed firms or individuals in which
the selection will be based on quality and cost based selection. TORs for all
contracts and all sole source selection of consultants, and contracts will be
subject to IDA prior review.
2.    Procurement Plans. Three months prior to the start of each GOL fiscal year, MOA
would submit a detailed procurement plan for the following fiscal year (para D2, page 15). Some
technical assistance has been budgeted to assist in preparing procurement documentation.
B.    Disbursement
3.    The proceeds of an IDA credit of US$6.80 million would be disbursed over a three year
period. The annual estimated disbursements are shown on page one of this PAD.
4.    The process of the IDA Credit would be disbursed against:
(a)    90% of expenditures on works contracts;
(b)    100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures for vehicles,
motorcycles and equipment;

Country: Lesotho                     Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
(c)    100% of expenditures for studies, training, workshops, tours and technical
assistance; and
(d)    100% of expenditures of operating costs.
5.    Statement of Expenditures. Disbursements for all expenditures would be against full
documentation, except for items of expenditures under contracts and purchase orders below
US$100,000 equivalent for goods, works and services of consultant firms and below US$50,000
equivalent for vehicles, services of individual consultants, for which disbursement would be
made on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documentation for SOEs
would be retained by the borrower for IDA review.
6.    SpecialAccounts. To facilitate disbursements a Special Account in US dollars would be
established at the Central Bank of Lesotho, under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
Upon project effectiveness, a sum not exceeding US$750,000 would be deposited lby IDA into
this account. Further deposits by IDA into this account would be made against wilhdrawal
applications supported by appropriate documenits.
7.    Audits. The project implementing agencies - Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of
Local Government will be required to maintain adequate books of accounts of all financial
transactions uander the project in accordance with sound and generally accepted accounting
principles. The implementing agencies will prepare annual Project Accounts in compliance with
international accounting standards and submit them to the Auditor General in accordance with
GOL's financial regulations. The Project accounts, SOEs and the Special Account would be
audited each year by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA. The auditors' reports and
certificates with respect to each of these three statements of accounts would be fuiished to IDA
within six months of the close of each fiscal year (by September 30). However, the option to use
private independent auditors would be maintained in case of capacity limitations at the Auditor
General's Office.

LETTER OF SECTORAL POLICY ON INSTITUTIONAL REFORM  OBJECTIVES
AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY IN AGRICULTURE
I.    This is to inform you about the proposed Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building
Project (APCBP) for which the Government of Lesotho is seeking financial assistance from IDA
and other donors. This letter outlines the strategic direction in the agricultural sector and the
measures proposed under the project.
Long Term Vision
2.    The agricultural sector is expected to continue to play a major role in meeting the
Government's core objectives of reducing poverty, improving household food security and
generating employment in an economically diversified and ecologically sustainable way. To
achieve this objective the Government has formulated a long term (10 year) Agricultural Sector
Development Program (ASDP) with the core objectives of increasing farm productivity and
incomes by improving farm technology transfer, creating a conducive economic environment for
increased investment in the agricultural sector, and increasing awareness and investment in the
management of natural resources. It is the Government's intention to request our development
partners to support the ASDP in a coordinated fashion through a program approach. However,
the Government is fully aware of the institutional and human resource constraints facing the
agricultural sector that would impede the satisfactory implementation of an ASDP type initiative.
It is our decision therefore, that we concentrate in the initial 3 years, on laying the foundation for
long term development by improving the policy and institutional environment and building
capacity for planning and implementation as a precursor to the launching of an ASDP.
Background to the Agricultural Sector
3.    Agricultural Performance and Constraints. Lesotho has limited comparative advantage
in Agriculture, but because of its socio-economic structure about 80 percent of its nationals
dwell in the rural areas and of which more than 50 percent derive their livelihood wholly or
partially from the agricultural sector. This sector also employs approximately 60 percent of the
country's labour force at close to subsistence wage levels and incomes. The latest estimates
suggest that agriculture's contributions to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is in the range of



Project Appraisal Document                                                         Page 48
Country: Lesotho                       Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
9-13 percent, with wide year to year fluctuations depending on the rainfall. Overall, agricultural
sector performance is still significantly below its potential.
4.     Constraints. The agriculture sector faces a number of inherent constraints. First, only
9 percent of land is arable and a significant proportion of this is not used to its potential. Second,
agriculture is largely rainfed and as a result output is heavily influenced by rainfaill which is erratic.
Third, rapid population growth exerts a lot of pressure on the already depleted natural resource
base. Consequently, annual per capita growth from agriculture has been negative over the past
10 years. The performance was better for the livestock sector which was less affected by inter-
annual rainfall variations.
The poor performance of the agricultural sector can be explained by:
(i)    the policy framework, which has been characterised by extensive interventions by the
government in the production, imarketing, processing and pricing of agricultural
commodities;
(ii)   institutional factors, including the system of land tenure and capacity constraints within
the public sector;
(iii)   a piecemeal approach to development assistance; and
(iv)   natural factors, such as erratic rainfall, poor soils and increasing land degradation in the
faLce of intense pressure from human and animal production, including encroachment of
residential sites into prime agricultural land.
5.     ALgricultural Sector Growth Strategy. The Government intends to pursue a policy of
sectoral development based on comparative advantage in a competitive, outward-looking
economic framework. To this effect the Government initiated the preparation of a 10 - 15 years
ASDP. H-owever it became apparent that the existing institutional and implementation capacity
was inadequate to carry ASDP through. Hence a decision was made to adopt Agricultural Policy
and Capacity Building Project (APCBP) as a stepping stone towards implementing ASDP.
6.    GOL realises that in order to effect growth in agriculture, there is a need to broaden the
productive base of the rural economy. This can only be achieved through 'intensification' of the
competitive crops and livestock products and 'diversification' into higher value commodities.
Amongst the export commodities, high vallue crops such as asparagus are expected to offer the
greatest prospects for growth in output in the short to medium term. In the grain food sector,
maize and wheat offers a similar potential if grown on a commercial basis. Concurrently support
is needed for the generation of small-scale non-farm activities in areas complementing intensive
agriculture and high-value cropping. Encouragement of private sector within agriculture should
be pursued to create employment opportunities.
7.     GOL intends to identify and promote its domestic resources for growth to supplement the
declining remittances of its migrant workers who are now being heavily retrenched by RSA mining
companies, and of course the now dwindling external donor finances of which Lesotho has been
heavily dependent upon.

8.     With the overall objective of stimulating domestic incomes and employment, GOL has
embarked on a course of economic, policy and institutional reform. This reform is the result of
extensive analysis and recommendations over many years, involves the liberalisation of trade and
commercial activities and the systematic privatisation of state enterprises and assets, many of
which have been subject to severe problems of management and commercial viability. The reforn
is aimed at cutting costs, increasing productivity and exposing the economy to the growtl
opportunities of international markets.
9.     While Lesotho's natural resources do not include very extensive areas of cultivable land,
the size and capabilities of its workforce provide the opportunity for intensifying production in
agriculture and in other productive sectors. This opportunity can only be realized, however, if an
open, commercially oriented strategy, as opposed to a protective development strategy, is
adopted. The government recognises that policy environment is still not conducive to full private
sector participation/initiative. For example, parastatals continue to operate but still make losses
and distort the markets. In addition, domestic marketing controls still.exist for some commodities.
The bottom line is that the institutional framework is still inadequate. Ministry of Agriculture
Cooperatives Marketing and Youth Affairs (MOA) functions ineffectively for reasons such as;
(i) weak extension links between research and farmers (inadequate exten,ion and research
strategies), (ii) insecurity in land tenure that inhibits investments which are .iecessary for high
value crops; and (iii) weak institutional capacity. GOL is committed to its programme of
privatisation, marketing deregulation and divestiture. A plan of action for market liberalisation
is shown in Annex I and a proposal to privatise/divest some of the state entf rprises is shown in
Annex 2. Both the Action Plan and a list of privatisable enterprises have been approved by
Cabinet.
Institutional Reform and Decentralisation Strategy
10.   MOA has recognised that ASDP will not have a sustainable impact on agricultural
development in Lesotho in the absence of a well defined and structured institutional reform.
Since the MOA's mission is only to facilitate the sector's development rather than participating
in direct production, this reform becomes crucial. The institutional reform consist of a set of
proposals for policy and institutional transformation. Concurrently, the Government is
decentralising delivery of services and associated planning, management and budgeting powers
from the central Ministries to the district level. Earlier efforts of MOA decentralization, were
not fully satisfactory because while service delivery and staff were decentralised, all authority
regarding planning, budgeting, decision making, personnel and financial management still
remained at Headquarters.
11.   To address these issues the Govemment of Lesotho through MOA has committed itself
to operationalize the Lesotho Agricultural Policy Framework, using the Agricultural Sector
Investment Programme as its key vehicle. In support of the sectoral policies whose objectives
are directed towards three priority areas, poverty alleviation, household food security and
employment, the Ministry has defined priority Capacity Building objectives aimed at
strengthening and streamlining its managerial and ensuring good governance, more specifically
to:
(i) re-assess the dominant role of the MOA in the provision of farm support services in the
agricultural sector and to find ways of increasing the participation of other stakeholders in
service provision, in accordance with Annex 1;
(ii) shift away from a centralized decision-making and control of public expenditure to a

(ii) shift away from a centralized decision-making and control of public expenditure to a
decentralized, district managed system of service delivery to farmers;
(iii) restructure the budgeting system to re-allocate resources towards priority, demand driven
services;
(iv) build overall capacity to manage the process of change and subsequent implementation of
the agricultural sector public expenditure programme.
(v) privatize and divest publicly funded commercial enterprises and services to save resources,
in line with Annex 2; and,
12.   In the expectation of a much tighter budgetary situation, the process described above is
considered particularly urgent and important especially in institutions whose scope of services
includes those that can be provided by the non-government sector including farmers,
communities, and other stakeholders.
13.   In view of the measures outlined above, many of which are already being implemented,
the Government of Lesotho requests your favourable consideration for an Agricultural Policy
and Capacity Building Project. Implementation of the project would be consistent with our
broader initiatives to improve governance through decentralization, increase efficiency in the
public sector through institutional reforms, and create greater opportunities for the private
sector through market liberalization. If fully implemented, the project will set the stage for the
implementation of ASDP which greatly enhance our capacity to address poverty and growth
for thie majority of our people.

Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
L     Preamble
1.    The Kingdom of Lesotho, a Southern African country, is a mountainous, land-locked
state, wholly surrounded by the Republic of South Africa, lying between latitudes 28 degrees and
31 degrees south and longitudes 27 degrees and 30 degrees east. The total area is 30,355 sq. km,
and it is the only sovereign country in the world surrounded by one other country. Lesotho is
ethnically homogeneous, with the Sesotho Language spoken by virtually all the indigenous
population. Sesotho, along with English as the second language, are the official languages. The
population of Lesotho is about two (2) million (1994), and is projected to be about 2,114,000 by
the year 2000 with an annual growth rate of 2.6%.
2.    Four broad agro-ecological or geographical zones, demarcated by ascending altitude,
extend approximately north-south across Lesotho, and the landform, soil, climatic and
vegetational characteristics of those zones largely determine their land-use. The zones are:
Mountains (or Highlands), Foothills, Lowlands, and Sengu River Valley. General elevations
exceed 1,000 meters with the highland peaks rising to 3,299 meters above sea level. The terrain is
generally rugged with steep slopes and fragile soil formations.
3.    Sheet wash and rill erosion is common on the mountains, particularly on overgrazed
range and cultivated land. The lowland area is particularly prone to erosion which is exacerbated
by long term inappropriate land-use. Gullies or " dongas" are a prominent feature of the
landscape.
4.    Lesotho has a cool sub-tropical climate with conditions largely determined by altitude
and subject to wide seasonal and geographical variations. Mean annual precipitation varies from
600 mm. in the southern and western lowlands to more than 1600 mm. in the north-eastern
highlands, where frost, heavy snowfall and hail storms are common during winter months.
Sengu Valley, in the rain shadow of the Maluti mountains, is significantly drier with an annual
total of 500-600 mm. There is considerable annual variation in rainfall totals, and the country
remains vulnerable to recurrent periods of droughts. Much of the rain falls in intense localized
thunderstorms, and hailstorms are common.
5.    The natural vegetation of Lesotho is dominated by grassland, and by indigenous shrubs
in some mountain areas. The present vegetation is regarded as a sub-climax resulting from human
interference and modification. Much of the country has become denuded of its natural grass
cover through uncontrolled grazing and rushing surface water. Related problems are severe soil
erosion, soil exhaustion and declining fertility, and desertification. Pure drinking water is
available to 43% of the population in both the urban and rural areas.

Country: Lesotho                       Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
6.     The environmental conditions of Lesotho render it particularly prone to land degradation
and soil erosion by water. Land is often steeply sloping and intense rainstorms, itogether with hail
and frost promote the detachment of soil particles. Geological erosion, as a result of exfoliation
which is a natural process, is greatly accelerated by inappropriate land use. The Lesotho
environment is very fragile and given the interplay of the forces of wind and water on its barren
surface, soil degradation and soil fertility reduction and polluted water resources are major
environmental problems.
7.     Agriculture, which is the main economic activity for more than 80% of the population,
continues to suffer from long term decline in production. For instance, domestic food production
fell short of national requirements by 45% in 1990. Farmland is scarce, and only 9% of the total
land area is suitable for arable agriculture and 66% for grazing. The area of cultivation has
declined by a third in the past three decades to 300,000 hectares in the 1990s. Many factors, both
natural and human-made, have contributed to this reduction, including: drought, soil erosion, the
system of land tenure, unsustainable land management practices and excessive livestock
numbers.
8.    In order to address the environmental issues of the country and help anrest the
degradation of this fragile natural resource base, the Government of Lesotho (GOL) in
collaboration with its donor partners, prepared the country's first national environmental strategic
framework, the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), defining the strategies, the
necessary legislative framework and regulating mechanism required to protect, control, enforce,
and monitor the use of the country's poor natural resources.
9.     T'he objectives and goals of the Agricultural Policy Capacity Building Project (APCBP)
are to mitigate the above major constraints on the country's economic and agricultural sectors by
putting in place policy arrangements that will provide food security and create jobs as basis for
alleviating poverty and reducing unemployment, as well as, provide the enabling environment for
increased private-sector participation in the delivery services to enhance agricultural production
for Lesotho.
II.    Statutory Framework
10.   In the GOL's bid to address poverty reduction and sustain macroeconomic performance
through greater integration into the sub-regional economy, it has adopted an outward oriented
strategy involving a program of economic, policy and institutional reform. The reform involves
the liberalization of trade and commercial activity and the privatization of state owned enterprises
(SOEs) and assets. As part of the reform, the Government is also facilitating a long-term
agricultural development framework, the Agricultural Sector Development Program (ASDP),
which ultimately has led to a full fledged Agricultural Sector Investment Program (ASIP).
11.   'Ihe APCBP fits very well into the overall strategy as the first phase o:f the long-term
ASDP and ASIP framework, with the goals of developing government's capacity through
institutional reform and decentralization, improving the enabling policy environment for
supporting the private sector development, as well as, promoting a comprehensive approach to
the natwral resource environment.

Country: Lesotho                    Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
12.   This policy initiative fits into the framework of the country's natural resources
management policies and the private sector development policies set up by the government and
embodied in the following undertakings:
*  the National Environmental Policy of Lesotho;
*  the Environment Bill (1997) currently passing through Parliament;
*  Lesotho Land Policy and Administration;
* the Natural Environment and Heritage Compensation, Rural Development and
Public Health;
*  the National Action Plan to Implement Agenda 21 for Lesotho;
*  the Workshop on the Extension Approach for Lesotho, organized by the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA);
*  the National Forum on Natural Resource Management, Combating Desertification
and Mitigating the Effects of Drought, organized by the National Environmental
Secretariat (NES);
*  the National Tree Planting Program at Masite-Maseru District, led by the King of
Lesotho in March, 1998; and
*  the Working Papers on Lesotho ASIP.
13.   The main thrust of the policy reform in general, and the various government undertakings
to date, is to focus on the broad endorsement and adoption of the core principles of an outward
looking economy in which government plays the role of a facilitator, instead of a service provider
and controller, so that the private sector could emerge and generate sustainable economic growth.
14.   To attain the objective of these undertakings, the major test will be the responsiveness of
the private sector to the enabling policy environment. For the public sector, the test will require
increased implementation of capacity building and policy sequencing according to priorities;
institutional and human resources development; improved planning; adequate donor
coordination; judicious development of infrastructure and putting into place implementable
environmental policies and actions.
15.   The priority areas needed for policy reforms in the APBCP are: extension and research;
animal health; availability of seed and planting materials; and land use planning, based on a
decentralized delivery process by underpinning the largely capacity building operations with
some selected pilot production type activities with a system of monitoring and environmental
impact assessment, and financing of projects that are in line with the ASIP objectives and
strategies.
m.   Probable Impacts of the Project
16.   The APCBP would generally lead to some changes in the ecological setting of areas to be
developed. To a great extent the project will have impacts on the physical environment, as well
as, on the socio-economic and political environment of Lesotho. From the assessment in general,
the project's impact on the natural environment and on the social and economic fabric is globally
positive.
17.   The Possible Positive Impacts. The APCBP would generally provide food security,
poverty alleviation, and increased private sector participation in the delivery of agricultural
production services. The project would contribute to the improvement in the policy environment

Country: Lesotho                      Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
and put in place a more sustainable and client responsive agricultural support services at the local
level (i.e. below the District Level). This will enable the smallholder farmers be in a better
position to respond to market incentives, and improve the management of their farm business and
incomes.
18.    The project will contribute to the creation of productive employment for the relatively
young population and may eventually reduce the emigration to South Africa of the country's
disciplined labor force. With the improvement of the quality of life through employment creation,
the production capacity of the private sector will be reinforced, thereby having significant
positive impact on the national economy, as well as, the natural environment. An improved
economy will also afford GOL the possibility of improving the village infrastructure,
communications, and social services for the rural and larger population.
19.   From the environmental health perspective, the project will afford the general population
food security, improved dietary intake and reduced malnutrition, especially infant malnutrition.
Although AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are not wide spread in the
country, making young people financially independent will hopefully minimize the temptations
for prostitution and emigration outside the country.
20.   In general, the positive impacts of the APCBP will include:
*  reversal of the long term decline in production and productivity by increasing
domestic food production (which fell short of national requirements by 45% in
1990);
* prevent the continual decline in arable land and scarcity of farmland, and stop the
increase in landlessness; and
 utilize and harness more efficiently the country's greatest natural asset of water
resources, which are now being developed through the Lesotho Highlands Water
Project (LHWP), by transferring water to South Africa and generating electricity for
Lesotho.
21.    TEhe Possible Negative Impact. Potential negative impacts due to the project may occur
on the physical environment, as well as, on the socio-economic and political relationships of the
country. Interventions to protect the environment and ensure a sustainable development pattern of
the private sector must recognize the impacts and put in place measures to prevent them. This
would ensure that those aspects of development that contribute to sustainable development are
recognized and encouraged, while actions which go against sound management practices are
discouraged or modified.
22.   iPhysical Impact. The main impacts on the physical environment are both natural and
human-made. Under the APCBP there can be a growing demand for arable land which may lead
to escalating the pressing environmental piroblems related to increased land degradation due to
expansion of cultivated land, declining soil fertility, decrease of arable lands, the collection of
firewood, the production of charcoal, the rnaintenance of large numbers of livestock, and
inefficient water resources conservation.
23.    All these activities already occurring could be exacerbated under this project, and could
contribute further to the reduction of vegeltation cover, which in turn leads to increased run-off,
soil erosion, formation of gullies and "dongas", land degradation, and loss of bio-diversity. The

Country: Lesotho                     Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacdty Building Project
activities also could compound the devastating effects of periodic droughts and desertification on
agricultural production.
24.   Socio-Economic Impact. The primary negative impact may be due to inadequate range
management practices that lead to resettlement problems, as a result of land-tenure policies,
which in turn will produce land displacement for communities and increase in landless farmers.
25.    Other negative impacts may be due to:
* institutional weaknesses manifesting themselves in inadequate resource management,
lack of trained staff and technical expertise, lack of built-in evaluation, assessment
and monitoring procedures, and analytical capability for implementing comprehensive
policies and programmes;
* lack of community participation in project planning, execution and management;
* lack of diffusion of appropriate technologies, especially of those technologies most
appropriate for rural settings, such as: terracing to control run-off, contour ditching,
mulching and gully plugs to control erosion;
- lack of education, information and research due to limited awareness of
environmental problems and understanding of the economic costs and consequences
of resource degradation resulting in unintended enviromnental damage ( an example
is the use of maximum tillage instead of "optimum" tillage of cultivated plots that
weakens the soil particles and makes the land vulnerable to erosion when rainfall
occurs);
* economic forces, subsidies and policy distortions, such as: the failure of policy and
market forces to reflect the true costs of resource de1letion, problems with pricing that
under value common foods and services, and non-enforcement of laws to protect the
environment;
* discriminatory practices against women, especially with respect to accessibility to
land and credit; and
- inability to put in place a timely rural electrification and other energy resources to
mitigate the unduly use of fuelwood that leads to de-forestation on a large scale.
26.   Political Impact. The primary political impact is the widespread and deep-rooted
poverty associated with an inequitable land tenure system, which does not provide rural people
with the necessary resources, or security to invest in conservation practices.
27.   It is easy enough to identify some of the more obvious and visually dramatic impacts of
human activity on the environment, but it is often difficult to establish what exactly should be
done about them. How natural resources and land use are used by people very much depends on
who owns those resources and, therefore, the nature of the land tenure system.
Other impacts may be due to:
* the weakness and poor coordination of inter-agency involvement in the management
and implementation of the policies that may affect the environment, i.e. the NES
should be made to play more active role in the APCBP;
* the weak and not clearly stated identification and assessment of risks involving
regulatory and institutional framework, the financial and market analysis, and
business scenarios that will attract the participation of the private sector; and

Country: Lesotho                     Projec Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacty Building Project
* the problems of obtaining credit for farmers and the utilization of rural banking
systems to enhance credit availability to farmers.
28.   Also, the virtual collapse of indigenous controls over grazing both in the lowlands and
the mounitains has long been associated with rapid degradation of vegetative cover, soil erosion
and gully formation over much of Lesotho. Some observers argue that diminution of the authority
of chiefs over grazing controls is a more important factor. There is a strong suggestion that the
collapse of pivotal local institutions governing grazing rotation and livestock movements have
aggravated the emergence of open-access, haphazard range management that has led to majority
of herders who continue to strip the rangelands.
29.   Full implementation of formal land regulations in Lesotho is constrained by the
persistence of culturally embedded land use practices which have remained more or less resilient
in spite of rapidly changing economic circumstances. The authority of traditional chiefs more
crucial in the past, in respect of allocating of rights to land, has largely been eroded by exigencies
of land pressure and the virtual disappearance of the arable land frontier. An important factor
hastening these adverse developments continues to be high rates of labor migration to South
Africa, transforming the structure of household labor availabiliky while making cattle a preferred
investment of surplus income from migrant wage remittances.
30.    The series of policy and legislative responses by GOL have been typically minimalist,
calculated to take account of the donors criticism without seriously undermining the tenets of
customary laws. This requires that the political impact should be addressed in a serious manner
for the success of the capacity building policy reform.
IV.   Mitigation Measures
31.   The mitigation plan which is in conformity with the World Bank's Operational Directives
attempts to put in place the required mechanisms to control the effects of the project on the
natural environment. The GOL has identified and recognizes most of the country's major
problems. The mitigation measures required to be put in place must be inter-related. What is now
required is to define an implementation strategy and establish a monitoring and surveillance
mechaniisms for the management of the anticipated problems at the district level and below the
district level. The recently concluded national workshop on the messages for the newly adopted
Unified Extension Approach (UEA) by MOA, is in the right direction.
32.   There should be a proper rangelarid management involving a central regulation,
restriction of livestock numbers over designated areas of pastures, allowing access to only
members of livestock/grazing associations, and introducing mandatory dipping and de-worming.
Formation and empowerment of Range Management Associations, and improvement of livestock
quality and provision of necessary infrastructure and inputs should be provided under this
project.
33.   The customary provision discouraging long fallow encourages desultory land-use
practices, inimical to natural resource conservation. Therefore, a thorough-going land policy and
legal reforms should be undertaken. The present application of FORM C should be assessed for
efficacy and promoted for effectiveness.



Project Appraisal Document                                                       Page 61
Country: Lesotho                      Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
34.    The mitigation and solution of environmental problems requires coordinated programmes
and activities by the different sectors of government and society. An enabling policy to allow
both Government and public to integrate environmental considerations in their development
activities is therefore essential. The role of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in
awareness building, education and protection should be given sufficient recognition.
35.    As the occurrence of soil infertility and pollution of water resources are major
environmental impact, protection measures to minimize such risks through constant monitoring is
an imperative. Also, the expansion and intensification of agriculture made possible by irrigation
has the potential for causing increased erosion, pollution of surface and groundwater from
agricultural biocides, and increased nutrient levels in the irrigation and drainage water resulting
in alga blooms. Hence, measures should be set up to control the quantities of agricultural
chemicals that are usually required in irrigated lands to keep production levels up, and to
compensate for high growth rate and loss of nutrients through leaching. Small-scale irrigation
should be preferred to large scale facilities.
V.    Monitoring and Evaluation
36.    Because of lack of clarity about extension objectives and messages (i.e. who is the target
group and what are we trying to achieve), it is not possible to measure the effectiveness of the
service, especially with respect to the impact on the natural resources and the assessment of the
environment.
37.    The monitoring system should be able to have at hand an effective management tool,
information services, and cost effectiveness in order to provide incentive system to the farmers to
become effective stakeholders.
38.    The issue of gender should be brought into the mainstream of research and extension
programme, design and implementation. In defining the client special attention should be given to
selecting women and ensuring that they are, at a minimum, represented in proportion to the
number of female-headed households.
39.    Well intentioned legal and administrative reforms in land-tenure since the 1960s have not
been enthusiastically implemented in rural areas. However, it would be too simplistic and
misleading to characterize the failure of implementation as a result of lingering tensions between
conservatism, represented by traditional chiefs, and innovation, represented by the bureaucrats
and ruling politicians. Traditional chiefs must be made to retain their significant role as credible
witnesses in dispute resolution and play an uneasy role in issuance of customary titles and
formalizing reallocations in the complex land tenure system.
40.    The Commissioner of Lands, and the Department of Lands Survey and Physical Planning
(DLSPP) should be strengthened to participate fully in the APCBP, especially in pursuing the
objectives of food security and poverty alleviation that can be directly related to land-tenure
issues.
41.    The MOA's self-monitoring and self-evaluation is sufficient, however, the NES should
play more active role to support these activities at the district and the area levels. For instance, the
NES should work with the MOA to prepare the standards and indicators, as well as, procedures
for monitoring that will be consistent across the country.

Country: Lesotho                      Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Building Project
42.    The primary concern should be the identification at the earliest stages of project
implementation and on a continuous basis, any pollution of the water resources, degradation of
the land, soil infertility, and loss of arable land.
VI.   Recommendations
43.    Thle project should benefit from the preparation of comprehensive rural and land use
planning carried out by the responsible government institutions or their consultants in
collaboration with the project management. This type of approach goes a long way in avoiding
sites that are susceptible to degradation, erosion and pollution.
44.    Also, the approach can make it possible to characterize land areas into: (i) areas that can
be rehabilitated; (ii) areas that can be regenerated, i.e. areas that has been degraded badly and can
be put into alternative uses; and (iii) areas that can be conserved. In this regard, apollution
potential map of Lesotho can be prepared vvith input from NES, DLSPP, and MV[OA. Such a map
can be utilized, for example, in identification of areas valuable for intensive farming for high-
value crops.
45.    The contents of the extension messages on the effects and impact of land use and
agricultural practices on the environment, particularly, on soil erosion, water conservation, and
range management, as regards to land degradation, poor crop production and livestock
production, must be increased in quality, i.e. beefed up.
46.    All projects, including those of the pilot activities under APCBP, should have
environmental impact assessment done whenever possible. The Department of Conservation,
Forestry, and Land Use Planning of MOA, especially the Soil, Water and Nature Conservation
Division, should play a leading role by coordinating activities with NES and the target clients at
the district level. It should be feasible to include environmentally trained liaison person to work
with stakeholders, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and clients on the extension
messages at the district levels and below the district levels.
47.   The National Environmental Secretariat (NES) should be strengthened in its capacity
building in order to carry out regular monitoring and evaluation of activities under APCBP, while
supporting the self-monitoring and self-evaluation efforts of MOA. As much as possible, the NES
should avoid implementing projects in the field under ASIP, because that will over-extend and
weaken its monitoring capabilities considerably.
48.    The land tenure issues and the practical ways these issues can impact ipositively on the
ASIP program, should be addressed with the cooperation of DLSPP and MOA, working closely
with the political leadership of Lesotho, thte Traditional Chiefs, and the target clients in the
communities, in order to rectify the core constraint affecting land-use and the attendant negative
impacts on the environment.
49.    The GOL should be encouraged to continue with its efforts in developing the parameters
for privatization, such as, regulatory and institutional framework; the financial and market
analysis; the business scenarios and procurement procedures, so that risks and incentives can be
measured for which actual private-sector participation can be undertaken by the people
themselves, preferably at the district levels. The process of privatization of the delivery services



Project Appraisal Document                                                         Page 63
Country: Lesotho                       Project Title: Lesotho Agricultural Policy and Capacity Buliding Project
for agricultural production should be gradual, and the GOL should resist any apparent fast-track
approaches that may be suggested by international lending institutions and donors.
50.    Education and research efforts should put emphasis on extension messages that response
to educating the youth, school pupils, students, and women on the implications of environmental
impact due to land use and agricultural practices. The messages should include the concepts of
entrepreneurship in agricultural related services by demonstrating the incentives, risks, and the
ability to make a decent living in farming, as well as, the attractiveness and the envirommental
friendliness of the agro-business and industry. This will sow the seed for private sector
participation for the future.
51.    The extension messages should include workshops, demonstrations, and pilot activities
that will enhance and attract business people into agricultural services and farming. This will
make it possible to bring in needed resources to the subsistence farmers, and help in the transition
into small-scale and medium-scale farning for a reasonable number of indigenous people at the
district levels.
52.    The GOL should look into the possibility of integrating all services and resources into a
comprehensive village/community infrastructure approach to support the current policies for
sustainable agricultural delivery services and food production.
53.    Emphasis should be given in the project to: the ability to understand and work with
credit, how to obtain credit, the use of rural banking and cooperative ventures, and provision of
agricultural related facilities (such as storage, silos, slaughter houses, bins, blowers, etc.). How to
maintain the harvest produce, and sustain the lean, drought seasons will be critical to the success
of the project, and should be addressed forcefully.
54.    Finally, extension messages should include an aggressive training of trainers (i.e.
extension officers), team leaders at the district and area levels, and technical expertise required to
conduct effective extension program under the unified extension approach (UEA). There is a
strong need to build up capacity so that every project at the local and district levels will include
information on environmental assessment. Emphasis should be put on the degree of the problem
at band, especially related to soil erosion and water conservation, to mitigate the declining soil
fertility and land degradation.
