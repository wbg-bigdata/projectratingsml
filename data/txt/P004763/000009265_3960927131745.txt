MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE ELECTRICITY GENERATING AUTHORITY OF THAILAND
FOR A POWER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan for an
amount of US$90 million equivalent is submitted for approval.  The proposed loan
would be extended to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate with a 20-year maturity including a grace
period of five years.  The Kingdom of Thailand would guarantee tlhe loan.  The
proceeds would help finance a Power System Development Project.
2.       BackgroMadg.  The social and structural transformation of the Thai economy
over the past three decades has been accompanied by rapid growth in energy
consumption. The expansion of the electric power system has been particularly
noteworthy: electricity sales and per capita consumption increased from 467 GWh and
19 kWh, respectively, in FY61 to about 30,000 GWh and 550 kWih in FY88. Growth in
electricity generation since 1980 has averaged 10.2% p.a. (compared to an average
GDP growth rate of 6.3%). A similar trend is expected to continue in the future as
the country's industrial and socio-economic development accelerates.
3.       Following several years of relatively slow growth as the Government
implemented a program of structural adjustment to control the fiscal and external
imbalances that had developed in the early 1980s, Thailand is presently experiencing
a sharp upsurge in economic activity: growth in GDP averaged 8.9% p.a. in FY87-88
compared to 5.7% p.a. in FY81-85 and 4.3% in FY86. This turnabout has been
accompanied by a sudden surge in the demand for basic infrastructure. In
particular, the growth in electricity demand in FY87-88 has been unexpectedly high
(14% p.a.), on account mainly of rapid industrial growth although additional impetus
has also originated 7rom the commercial sector partially driven by the development
of tourism. The outlook is for continued high economic growth at least until the
end of the current Five-Year Plan (FY87-91), with the antic.pation that rapid
expansion in electricity demand will ensue: energy generation is forecast to
incrsase at about 12% p.a. over the FY89-91 period.
4.       The energy sector in Thailand has been reasonably successful in meeting its
objectives of (a) promoting the rational development of domestic resources,
particularly natural gas and lignite, both of which are utilized as fuels for power
generation, accounting together for as much as 78% of total generation in FY88; (b)
encouraging energy conservation, in part through economically efficient pricing of
resources; and (c) relying increasingly on private sector initiatives in the
development of energy resources. Private sector participation is prominent in the
petroleum industry, most notably in the production of natural gas for the domestic
market, and in the lignite mining industry where private contractors to EGAT are
responsible for much of the exploitation of the mines. The Government is now
investigating ways of bringing private capital and expertise to bear on the
development of the power sector. As regards sector organization, the establishment
in 1986 of the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO) under the Office of the Prime
Minister has brought considerable improvement by facilitating intrasectoral
coordination and helping harmonize the investment plans and policies of the various
entities involved in the sector.



- 2 -
5.       Following years of low power investment, the recent surge in electricity
demand has made it imperative for EGAT to accelerate capacity additions to keep the
reliability of the power system at acceptable levels during the early 1990s. EGAT
has several options for its generation expansion strategy. For base-load
generation, natural gas and lignite, both of which are available domestically in
large quantities, provide t}.e most attractive fuel choices. The use of natural gas
to generate electricity is optimized in combined-cycle plants because of their lower
capital and running costs, shorter construction period and higher conversion
efficiency compared to conventional steam units. However, the growing needs of the
power sector require the combined development of gas- and lignite-based facilities
and EGAT's Power Development Plan (PDP) is predicated accordingly on balanced
reliance on the two fuels.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank has a close working relationship
with the various key entities in the energy sector and is often approached for
advice and assistance on a variety of important sectoral issues. The Bank has had a
significant input in the formulation of EGAT's PDP, first through a 1985 Energy
Assessment Report (Report No. 5793-TH) and, more recently, through a study carried
out jointly with the Government on appropriate investment strategies in light of
uncertain oil prices. The Bank is currently assisting the Government in developing
a strategy for lignite development, with a particular emphasis on sector management
and environmental aspects. The Bank expects to be involved in the formulation of
future sectoral investment programs through regular review of EGAT's PDP. Its
ongoing involvement in the petroleum, power and lignite subsectors also allows it to
help improve intrasectoral coordination. The proposed project, along with the
various proposed sector work, would provide the Bank with a vehicle for continued
dialogue on important issues in the sector.
7.       Project Objectives. The objective of the proposed project is to help meet
the growth in power demand expected over the medium term while reducing the
country's dependence on imported fuels by supporting the concomitant development
and economic use of domestic lignite and natural gas. The project is also designed
to support measures to strengthen EGAT's institutional and financial capabilities.
8.       Project Description. The project would consist of a two-year (FY89-90)
time-slice of EGAT's investment program during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period. The
purpose of the program is to provide sufficient electric power to meet the forecast
growth in demand at least cost, while maintaining the required reliability of the
system. The project would involve the construction of new generation capacity,
reinforcement and expansion of transmission systems, expansion of lignite mining
facilities and other miscellaneous works, together with the installation of
computerized maintenance systems, the acquisition of environmental monitoring
equipment, and specialized training. The project constitutes an integral part of
EGAT's PDP, which was reviewed by the Bank and was found to represent the least cost
alternative for meeting EGAT's needs. The proposed Bank loan would finance
subprojects selected in accordance with agreed investment criteria. For
administrative convenience, EGAT has indicated that it intends to allocate initially
the proceeds of the loan to (a) the construction of Blocks 364 of the Bang Pakong
combined-cycle power plant; and (b) the expansion of the Mae Koh lignite mine to
meet the requirements of power units 8&9 now under construction. These two program
components were fully appraised during project evaluation. The expansion of the Mae
Moh lignite mine will involve important water management works and the resettlement
of about 1,500 families. These aspects of the project were closely reviewed at
appraisal and their proposed handling by EGAT was found satisfactory. The loan
would provide for retroactive financing for up to US$6 million equivalent.

9.       Total financing required for the project: is estimated at about US$2,037
million, with a foreign component of US$1,168 million (57%). A breakdown of project
costs and the financing plan are showv  In Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement sehedule are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and status of Bank Group operations
in Thailand are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7364-TH, dated February 22, 1988 is being distributed
separately.
10.      Afreed Actions.  Durlng negotiations, agreement was reached with EGAT and
the Government on the following:
(a) a continuation of previous financial covenants specifying that both
EGAT and the power sector as a whole will earn a self-financing ratio
of not less taan 25%, based on a three-yeat average of capital
expenditures;
(b) a debt-to-equity ratio not exceeding 60:40 and a ratio of short- and
medium-term debt to total debt not exceeding 15% for EGAT;
(c) metnodology for the setting by EGAT of the transfer price of lignite;
(d) the procedures related to the evaluation of subprojects to determine
their eligibility for Bank financing.
11.      Befits.  The project forms an integral part of EGAT's least-cost
expansion program, the rate of return on which is estimated at 14%. The bulk
of the proposed investments is predicated on the use of domestic lignite and
natural gas, both of which have been shown to provide the most economic means
of producing electricity in Thailand. An important feature of the project is
that it will support the construction of combined-cycle type power plants
which will optimize the use of natural gas in generating electricity.
12.      Risks.  There are no major risks associated with the project.
Construction delays are unlikely in view of EGAT's construction experience.
There is also little risk associated with the lignite mine investment program,
given EGAT's satisfoctory performance under two previous Bank-assisted
projects, and lignite reserves are more than adequate to support the proposed
expansion of the Mae Koh mine.
13.      Recomandatio. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the lank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
