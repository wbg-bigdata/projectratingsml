IMPLEMNETATION COMlPLETION REPORT
THAILAND
POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 2915-TH)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Power Transmission
Project in Thailand for which Loan 2915-TH in the amount of US$110 million equivalent was
approved on March 1, 1988. The loan was closed on December 31, 1993, as planned during
appraisal. It was fully disbursed, and the last disbursement took place on March 8, 1994.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Brahm Prasher, Consultant for the Infrastructure
Operations Division of Country Department I, East Asia and Pacific Region, and was reviewed by
Mr. Vineet Nayyar, Chief of Infrastructure Operations, East Asia and Pacific Region 1. The
Borrower, Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand iEGAT), provided comments on the ICR
and prepared a Borrower's Evaluation Report in accordance with ICR guidelines, which are
included as Appendices to the ICR.
Preparation of the ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision mission in
May 1993. It is based on the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the Loan and Guarantee Agreements,
Supervision Reports, correspondence between the Bank and EGAT, internal Bank memoranda and
other material in the project files. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by
providing most of the financial, performance, and investment data for the project and
supplementing the Bank's information on the project implementation and operation experience.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND
POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 2915-TH)
Evaluation Summarv
Introduction
1.           The Bank has been involved in financing power projects in Thailand over the last three
decades, and had made 13 loans to EGAT for the construction of transmission, hydro and thermal
power, and lignite mining projects prior to the approval of this transmission project. At the time of
project preparation, power consumption in Thailand was forecast to grow rapidly, with serious
shortages of electric energy predicted in the Southern and Central Regions by 1990-91. With Bank
support, EGAT decided in 1985 to advance the schedule for construction of a transmission
strengthening and expansion program included in its Power Development Plan (PDP) (FY87-96), of
which the Central-Southern tie-line forms a part, to alleviate the looming power shortages in the
Southern Region and achieve other objectives. The strategy to address the needs of the Southern
Region through transmission of power from the Center, was considered to have lower risk than the
alternative initial plan for construction of combined cycle plants in the South. Reassessments during
project preparation on the availability of natural gas from off-shore fields showed uncertainties on the
quantities, timing, and price of the gas needed to fuel those combined cycle plants (para. 1).!'
2.           The transmission project addressed diverse objectives, in addition to relieving shortages
for electric energy. These objectives may briefly be stated as follows: (a) expand and strengthen
EGAT's transmission system; (b) achieve a better integration of the national grid so that optimal
generating options may be chosen in future without being unduly restricted by regional constraints; (c)
reduce reserve margin for the system as a whole; and (d) upgrade the existing load dispatch centers into
a state-of-the-art countrywide control system (para. 2).
3.           The physical components of the project included EGAT's Transmission System Program
No. 7 consisting of 740 km of 115/230 kV lines and associated substations; 215 km of the single-circuit
500 kV transmission line for Mae Moh Unit No. 9 and line-end substations; 350 km of 230 kV
Southern-Central tie-line and associated line-end substations. Additionally, the project included the
construction of a National Control Center (NCC) and two Regional Control Centers (RCC), including
real-time processing units with advanced on-line software for access to 116 remote substations (paras. 3
and 25).

4.            EGAT and the RTG agreed to certain covenants to ensure a strong financial position
and continued viability of the power subsector in Thailand. These covenants relate mainly to issues
affecting the financial performance of EGAT, such as self-financing ratio, debt loads, relative levels of
short and medium term debt, fuel adjustment provisions for electricity charges, and other provisions
relating to the tariff structure (para. 10).
5.            The project was completed at a total cost of US$229 million (including IDC), about
7.5% above appraisal estimates. The Bank provided a loan of US$110 million equivalent which
covered about 87% of the foreign component costs. Save for US$4 million in export credits, the rest of
the financing was accessed from local and commercial banks, and from EGAT's own internal resources.
The project was substantially implemented within the estimated completion schedule; the delay of six
months in the overall project completion date pertained mainly to minor and non-critical parts of the
project (paras. 5 and 17).
Implementation Experience and Results
6.            Construction of the Southern-Central tie-line assisted in relieving the looming power
shortages in the Southern Region and helped achieve integration of the Southern Region with the other
regions of the Kingdom. The strategy adopted was effective in reducing investment levels over the
alternative strategy for construction of combined cycle plants in the South and a submarine gas pipeline
to transport gas to fuel those plants (para. 17).
7.            The construction of the 500 kV line has provided the means for supplying cheap lignite
based power from Mae Moh to relieve predicted shortages in the high consuming Central Region. The
addition of the 115 kV and 230 kV lines and associated substations has assisted in meeting the target for
covering all of Thailand's provinces with 115 kV and 230 kV facilities by 1995 (para. 6).
8.            Through this project, significant improvements in the tariff structure were effected,
which may yield further beneficial effects, such as a reduction in peaking capacity needs and
conservation in energy use. Cross-subsidies, size and number of blocks for residential consumers were
also reduced. Optional time-of-day (TOD) tariff for large and medium size consumers was introduced,
and the tariff for these consumers was also restructured. Additionally, the Government agreed that
changes in the fuel cost, property taxes, demand side management costs and value-added taxes may be
reflected immediately on kWh charges. These adjustments have been made since June 1992 and are
expected to improve the financial health of EGAT, while conferring other long term benefits (paras. 8-
9).
9.            For the period FY1989-93, EGAT's financial position has been strong and the utility
has been in compliance with all covenants under the loan agreement. The utility generated significant
internal funds to finance its investment programs.  EGAT's financial parameters specified in the
covenants were significantly above the minimum requirements for compliance. The economic rate of
return (ERR) calculated in 1994 for EGAT's PDP (FY87-96) is 23.1 %, and is significantly higher than
the appraisal estimate of 18.5%. The higher ERR is largely attributed to the much higher kWh sales
and lower oil prices during the period than those assumed at appraisal (paras. 10-1 1).

Findinas. Future Operations. and Lessons Learned
10.           The project's sustainability is highly likely since EGAT is technically, administratively
and financially a strong utility. EGAT follows standard maintenance practices to ensure operability of
its facilities. Thailand's growing demand for power ensures utilization of all the capabilities constructed
under this project.  The project objectives have been substantially realized, including substantial
improvement and rationalization of the tariff structure. The outcome for the project may be classified
as satisfactory. The key factor in the successful outcome for the project was thorough preparation of
the project, followed by the Borrower's outstanding project management and execution efforts during
implementation. The Bank played a constructive role in project identification and preparation, and the
Bank's dialogue with the Borrower assisted in initiating action for revision of the tariff structure and
completion of the load forecasting study. A load management tool is now available which would
provide more useful data on demand, based on a wider set of economic and demographic variables
(paras. 17 and 22).
11.          The transmission facilities and other capabilities constructed are being used in day-do-
day operations, and future operations involving the transmission system will be assessed for
performance and benefits by monitoring certain operational parameters, such as the outage factors,
failure rates of equipment, effectiveness protective index, and total transmission system losses. About
80% of the software applications are already being used in the National and Regional Control Centers
to monitor the system in Thailand. The rest of the software, including the Economic Dispatch and Unit
Commitment functions, have not been implemented yet.  These elements of the project will be
completed by 1998 (paras. 23-24).
12.          There are certain lessons which may be recounted from  the preparation and
implementation experience: (a) the broad-based dialogue and rapport among the parties resulted in
significant decisive actions and policies which have strengthened the power subsector; (b) EGAT's
adherence to the financial covenants has helped EGAT evolve into a strong and highly efficient utility;
(c) seeking Environmental clearance prior to implementation is necessary to avoid delays, cancellation,
or modification during implementation, as experienced on a small part of one transmission line which
was initially planned to pass through the national reserve forest; and (d) the high attrition rates
experienced recently in mid-level professional staff need to be reversed and compensated by developing
staff through reinforced training and hiring programs. Such measures need to be also complemented by
more attractive compensation structures to retain capable staff (para. 25).



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND
POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 2915-TH)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.          Most of the electricity generation and transmission in Thailand is the responsibility of the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). At the time of project preparation, power
consumption was expected to grow rapidly in Thailand, with substantial shortages of electric energy
projected for the Central and Southern Regions by 1990-91. Initially, EGAT's Power Development Plan
(PDP) for FY87-96 was expected to address the looming shortages of electric energy in the Southern
Region through the construction of combined cycle plants in the South to be fueled by natural gas
supplied through a new submarine pipeline from off-shore fields being simultaneously developed by
international companies.  Subsequent assessment during project preparation, however, showed
uncertainties with regard to the timing and quantity of gas to be available from these fields. There was
also some uncertainty on the level of demand growth for electric energy in Thailand, since demand was
thought to relate to the price of energy fuels, which could not then be predicted with certainty for the
future. In keeping with EGAT's development strategy for the Sixth and Seventh Plan (FY87-96), a
decision was made to advance the implementation of a transmission system program to strengthen
EGAT's transmission system and concurrently address the urgent needs of the Southern Region. This
strategy was also perceived to be cost effective in overcoming the risks associated with the uncertainties
on timing, availability and price of gas supplies.
2.          The objectives of the project were to: (a) expand and strengthen EGAT's transmission
system consistent with the continued development of urban and rural electrification; (b) achieve a better
integration of the national power grid and help choose optimal generating options without unduly
restrictive regional constraints; (c) deal with demand and supply uncertainties with minimum reserve
margin requirements for the generating system; (d) upgrade the existing load dispatch centers into a state-
of-the-art country-wide control system; and (e) promote improvements in load forecasting methods and
in power tariff structure.
3.          The project objectives were to be attained by the design, procurement and construction of
physical project components which may briefly be described as follows: (a) 740 km of transmission lines
at 115 kV/230 kV and associated substations and additional transformer capacity; (b) National and
Regional System Control Centers including real-time processing units with advanced software and access
to 116 remote stations; (c) a Central-Southern Transmission tie-line (350 km double-circuit, 230 kV) and
expansion of line-end substations; and (d) a transmission line extension for Mae Moh Power Unit No.
9 (215 km, single-circuit, 500 kV).  In addition, the project included consultancy services for



-2-
engineering, supervision and inspection for the 500 kV component of the project, and also specialist
services to provide assistance with detailed engineering and supervision for the system control centers.
4.           With Bank support and assistance in defining the terms of reference, the Royal Thai
Government (RTG) also agreed to institute a study under the coordination of the National Economic and
Social Development Board (NESDB) to improve the power sector's load forecasting methodology.
Additionally, the RTG also agreed to carry out a time-phased plan for reform and improvement of the
tariff structure.  Even though  a tariff study had been completed under the National Energy
Administration's coordination in 1986, no subsequent action plan had been formulated to rationalize and
improve the tariff structure.
B. Achievement of Objectives
5.          The physical components of the project were substantially completed as planned during
project preparation.  With completion of construction of the physical components, the underlying
objectives were substantially realized for the project as a whole. The program conceived under this
project has assisted in achieving the target for covering all of Thailand's provinces with 230 kV and 115
kV facilities by 1995. The completion of the Central-Southern transmission tie-line and associated
facilities has assisted in strengthening the integration of Region 3 with the rest of the country (Regions
1, 2, and 4). The strengthening of the national grid thus makes it possible to choose optimal generating
options in the future without being unduly subject to restrictive regional constraints. With completion
of the tie-line, the project has in the near term also assisted in relieving the shortages expected in
electricity supplies in the Southern Region, while coping with the uncertainties on the availability and
price of natural gas and other fuels.
6.          Completion of the 500 kV extension line from Tha Tako to Nong Chok, and associated
substation and other facilities, resulted in the addition of needed transmission capacity to transfer low cost
energy based on lignite from Mae Moh in the north to the high consuming areas in the Central Region.
The 500 kV line, which has been superimposed on the existing grid, relieves overload of the underlying
grid following line faults. Pursuit of the low risk strategy under this project resulted in deferral of the
construction of the combined cycle plant in the South and a submarine pipeline required to supply it with
gas. In the immediate term, there were significant savings in capital investments, since the submarine
pipeline alone would have required about four times as much investment as that needed to connect the
Southern and the Central Regions with a tie-line, as estimated during project preparation in 1985. These
issues were of particular concern to the RTG, since foreign debt loads were increasing.
7.          In conformity with the loan covenants, a study was completed under the supervision of the
NESDB to evolve an improved forecasting methodology to predict electricity demand and provide useful
data for demand management. Prior to this study, the load-forecasting process consisted of projections
of demand for EGAT, MEA and PEA customer groups and reconciling these with projections based on
econometric studies at the national level.  The methodology did not reflect the effect of interfuel
substitutions and market saturation factors, which were beginning to affect consumption in urban areas.
The new methodology takes into account more economic and demographic variables than were previously
used to predict demand for electric energy, and this methodology is expected to provide more in-depth
data for demand management in future.
8.          Prior to 1991, EGAT complied with a Bank-prescribed tariff covenant under Loan 3027-TH
requiring quarterly review of its rates and maintenance of a fuel cost variation charge clause in its tariff



-3-
structure. EGAT and the sector have complied substantially with this covenant in the past; however, rate
adjustments to reflect fuel costs have not been automatic, but were subject to Government review.
Consequently, at times in the past tariff adjustments have been delayed. The existing tariff was also
complicated with excessive cross-subsidies from large-scale consumers to small residential consumers,
and did not reflect the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of electricity. Under an agreement reached with
the Bank during project preparation, the NESDB was required to evolve a revised tariff and obtain
Cabinet approval for the rationalized tariff structure. Before completion of the project, a new tariff had
been implemented which:  (a) has restructured the tariff for large and medium industrial/business
consumers; (b) reduced the size and number of blocks for residential consumers; (c) introduced optional
time-of-day (TOD) tariff for large and medium scale industrial and business consumers; and (d) adjusted
rates for large/medium residential customers to reflect cost of service. The only element of the action
plan under the covenants which has not been implemented concerns the use of contracted demand, instead
of metered demand, with regard to charges on energy for large and medium scale users. This element
is planned for review before the next tariff revision in 1995.
9.          Additionally, the RTG also agreed that, with effect from October 1991, EGAT could make
adjustments on the sale price of electricity to reflect changes in its fuel cost, land and property taxes,
demand side management costs, and value-added taxes (VAT). A fuel price adjustment could be made
if fuel costs cause a change in production costs of more than 2 stangs per kWh. These adjustments have
been made on a monthly basis since June 1992. The improvements made in the tariff structure discussed
above are expected to yield benefits in the future. Automatic adjustments in rates based on added fuel
and other costs would insure adequate returns for the utility. Other provisions in the tariff, especially
the reduction of cross-subsidies, are expected to provide incentives to the consumer to practice
conservation. The introduction of TOD tariff for medium and large industrial/business consumers are
expected to assist in restraining demand during peak load periods.
10.         EGAT's financial performance during FY89-93 (Appendix C) has been satisfactory and
was within the covenanted parameters. The average rate of return (ROR) during the period was 9.1 %.
The RORs in FY92 and FY93 of 8.04% and 6.28%, respectively, were appreciably lower than the RORs
for the first three years during the period because remittances to the RTG increased significantly. The
self-financing ratio averaged 40%, the average debt-service coverage ratio was 1.97 times while the debt
to total capital ratio averaged 45 % during the period. The average operating and current ratios during
the five year period were also satisfactory at 80% and 89%, respectively.
11.         With completion of this transmission project, the economic rate of return (ERR) calculated
for EGAT's investment program in the time-slice period FY87-96 is 23. 1% (Part II, Table 9) and
compares favorably with the SAR estimate of 18.5%. The higher ERR reflects much greater than
forecast energy sales during the period and lower oil prices compared to appraisal estimates. The
methodology used in re-evaluating the economic rate of return is similar to that used in the SAR and is
discussed further in Appendix C.
C. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affectine the Project
12.         EGAT's implementation effort was staffed with its own competent teams, with assistance
from foreign and local consultants where needed.  The project was well conceived, designed and
organized, and project preparation was thorough. Prior to the implementation of this project, the Bank
had made 13 loans to EGAT for financing projects in the transmission, hydropower, thermal power and
lignite mining areas. EGAT's superior implementation record is characterized by timely completion of



-4-
its projects and substantial achievement of project objectives. However, as shown in Table 3, there was
a six month delay in completing the overall project as described below, even though the objectives for
the overall project were substantially realized by the SAR completion date.
13.          A contract for the construction of 75 km of 115 kV transmission line had to be canceled
at the request of the contractor. The Forest Department of the RTG, in accordance with RTG policy,
objected to the right of way request through the national reserve forest for 59 km of this section. The
line had to be rerouted and approval for the new route had to be obtained afresh from the RTG. At loan
closing, approval for the revised route had not been obtained yet from the RTG. EGAT plans to
complete this revised section from its own funds following approval of the route by the RTG. The
partially procured transmission materials for the canceled section will be used as spares in EGAT's
current transmission system. This was the only significantly unforeseen contingency for the project which
resulted in some cost changes and delays for the project. The delay in the completion of some substations
and the Regional Control Centers can partially be attributed to the acute shortages of cement in Thailand.
A construction boom in Thailand and the RTG's concurrent restrictive policies for the import of cement
had a material effect on EGAT's construction schedules.
14.          The responsibility for conducting the load forecasting study and for evolving and
implementing the tariff structure involved a number of agencies and key entities within the RTG. Though
the processes for arriving at key decisions and judgements on these issues were inherently complex, the
objectives on the tasks were substantially realized, as discussed in Section B.
15.          EGAT had made use of a significant level of international consultant resources for
execution of some project components. About 300 man-months of consultant effort was procured for
supervision, engineering and inspection of the 500 kV transmission component and another 30 man-
months of effort was procured for detailed engineering and supervision of the Regional and National
system control centers (SCCs). All consultants performed satisfactorily on the project.
16.          The overall completion cost for the project, including interest during construction (IDC),
was US$229 million, which was 7.5% above the appraisal estimate of US$213 million. Higher
equipment and material costs accounted for most of the increased costs (Part II, Table 8A).
D. Proiect Sustainability
17.          The project has provided several technical and economic benefits for EGAT's transmission
and generation system as a whole. These benefits are likely to be sustained into the future. The risks
to project sustainability are minimal and the following aspects reinforce the case for sustainability:
(a)    Demand growth for electric energy remains strong in Thailand, and demand is likely to
remain strong in future in tandem with the high economic growth rates projected for the
country. The facilities and capabilities constructed or procured under this project will thus
be utilized fully.
(b)   EGAT has a capable management and technical manpower base, and a proven track record
for efficiently operating its facilities. It follows maintenance and servicing practices which
are comparable to those of highly rated utilities in the developing world. Premature
obsolescence and deterioration of its plants and transmission facilities is not expected.



-5-
E. Bank Performance
18.         Overall, the Bank's performance in project identification, preparation assistance, appraisal
and supervision has been satisfactory. The Bank has had a long, constructive and cordial relationship
going back to 1957 with EGAT and its predecessor entities. This rapport has enabled the Bank to provide
effective and substantial assistance, especially during identification and preparation phases of projects.
The Bank, EGAT and the RTG have jointly examined policy, planning and financial issues affecting
Thailand's generation and transmission system. The Bank was instrumental in advancing the schedule
for implementation of the project to expand and strengthen Thailand's transmission. This resulted in
considerable reductions in capital investment and savings of foreign exchange, while avoiding
uncertainties on the availability of natural gas, if combined cycle plants had been constructed in the
South.
F. Borrower's Performance
19.         The Borrower's performance on all aspects of project preparation and implementation was
satisfactory. EGAT is endowed with broad-based supervisory, management and technical staff, even
though recently it has experienced significant attrition in its middle level professional staff. Its projects,
including the present one, are generally completed in a timely fashion and with substantial realization of
objectives. With regard to its efficiency, operational and planning capabilities, recent Bank performance
audit reports and other assessments have rated EGAT's performance as being outstanding. EGAT is
highly conscious of the time value of money/investments and readily accesses expertise to assist
implementation of its projects when its own internal resources are not sufficiently staffed in some areas.
20.         Bank staff assigned to the project have a highly favorable view of EGAT's performance
record and managerial capabilities. Most of the subprojects were executed in a manner such that timely
realization of the bulk of the objectives was possible, even when delays were encountered for completion
of parts of the subprojects. Delays and unforeseen problems on a few components were in most cases
due to factors beyond EGAT's control. To the Bank's knowledge, EGAT maintained good working
relationships with consultants and contractors it had engaged on this project.
21.         EGAT confirmed that the recommendations and suggestions from the Bank during project
preparation and implementation were helpful.  The scope of the project was defined during project
preparation missions by Bank staff, and it was confirmed during the pre-appraisal mission in November
1985. By this time the RTG had approved the transmission system for Mae Moh Unit No. 9. This early
start on project preparation and organization speaks well for EGAT's organizing and implementation
capabilities.
G. Assessment of Overall Outcome
22.         The overall outcome for the project is rated as satisfactory.  During and since the project
was completed, demand for power has increased rapidly in Thailand. Strengthening and augmentation
of the transmission system under this project has increased the reliability and capability of the system to
deliver more electric energy in the Central and Southern Regions.

H. Future Operations
23.         The transmission facilities and other capabilities installed under this project are being used
in day-to-day operations to transport power and control/monitor system operations. To maximize project
benefits and assess performance, EGAT and the Bank will monitor certain parameters on the system as
described in the Aide-Memoire for the completion mission (Appendix A, Attachment 1). With respect
to the transmission lines, the parameters to be monitored would be the forced outage rates and the outage
factors. For the performance of the substations, the parameters to be monitored would be the failure rate
of equipment, the effectiveness index of protective system, and the availability index of each type of
equipment. Total transmission system losses will be monitored to assess the overall system performance.
In FY93, EGAT reduced transmission system losses to 4. 1 % from 4.41% in the corresponding period
in FY92.
24.         Currently, about 80% of the applications software is being used in day-to-day operations
in the National and Regional Control Centers. The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
system is currently being used for system monitoring, voltage and frequency control, and recently for
controlling equipment in some substations. EGAT plans to fully control all substations using this system
by 1997. There are still some constraints to be overcome and resolved to effectively utilize all the
functions available within the control system software. EGAT plans to overcome these constraints to
have a fully operational control and monitoring system by the year 1998 as described in the completion
Aide-Memoire in Appendix A (para 3-5 and Attachment 1). The coordination between the hydro and
thermal generation plants has still to be worked out to enable use of all the functions in the software.
Some of EGAT's older generation plants are monitored using different output signals than signals used
in the newer and other mature plants. These have to be reconciled to have a fully automated and optimal
operating system. The financial covenants monitored during the implementation of this project continue
to be effective under on-going projects and financing programs with EGAT.
I. Key Lessons Learned
25.         The transmission project was well conceived, designed and organized, and was completed
with substantial achievement of the objectives. The overall outcome for the project was satisfactory.
There are some lessons which may be deduced from the implementation experience.
(a)   EGAT readily accesses expertise and resources from consultants when it is not available
amongst its ranks. This has resulted in expeditious completion of projects and substantial
achievement of project objectives. This policy also recognizes the time value of money
and has resulted in significant financial payoffs to EGAT over the years.
(b)   The decade of the eighties has been characterized by heightened awareness and sensitivity
to environmental and conservation issues all over the world. To complete projects rapidly
and efficiently, executing institutions need to anticipate problems and obtain environmental
and other clearances prior to project preparation.
(c)   Recently, EGAT has experienced significant attrition in middle level professional staff,
which provides an important link between junior and upper levels of management. There
has been a hollowing of the ranks in terms of capabilities critical for project
implementation. Left unchecked, continued attrition of experienced ranks can significantly



-7-
impact performance in implementing and operating projects. The attrition of experienced
staff need to be reversed through appropriate programs, including better compensation and
reinforced training programs.

Aide - Memoire
World Bank Mission July 4 - 13, 1994
1  A World Bank Mission comprising of Mr. Brahm Prasher (consultant) visted EGAT from July
4 to 13, 1994 for a field completion mission to prepare the Implementation Completion
Reports (ICRs) for the Power Transmission Project (Loan 2915-TH) and the Second Power
System Development Project (Loan 3138-TH). The mission gratefully acknowledges the
excellent cooperation and hospitality extended to it by EGAT.  The Mission was also
favorably impressed with the level of assistance from EGAT in providing the Bank with
information on the financial, technical, environmental, implementation and operational
aspects of the projects.
2. EGAT and the mission discussed the borrower's role in preparing its final evaluation of the
projects implementation and operation experience, as required under the Loan Agreement,
including preparation of the summary reports which are to be attached to the ICRs. EGAT
will transmit its evaluation reports for the two projects, including the summary reports, within
three months of the present mission. The Bank will complete the draft ICRs on the projects
within approximately the same period and will transmit the drafts to EGAT for comment. The
main findings with respect to the ICR mission are as follows:
A. Power Transmission Proiect (Loan 2915-TH)
3. The project has been completed satisfactorily and implementation objectives have been
substantially realized. Except for a relatively small fraction (less than 8%) of the 115 kV
transmission lines, all the components of the transmission project involving the 500 kV, 230
kV, the rest of the 115 kV transmission lines, and the numerous substations were completed
as planned during project appraisal. About 80% of the application softwares have been
implemented and are being used in day-to-day operations in the National and Regional
Control Centers. The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is currently
being used for system monitoring, voltage and frequency control, and recently for controlling
equipment in some substations. EGAT plans to fully control all the substations using this
system by the year 1997.
4. The Load Frequency Control (LFC) function has been used since the National Control Center
has been in operation in 1992. The Economic Dispatch (ED) function has not been used due
to some system constraints which have not been overcome yet. As in the case of the ED,
the Unit Commitment (UC) function has not been utilized yet, due also to unresolved system
constraints. The function needs to be modified to affect coordination between hydro and
thermal generation within EGAT's power generation system
5. The mission and EGAT discussed the operational plan for maximizing the benefits of the
project in the future. To assess the operations and measure performance of the project in
the future, EGAT will monitor the indicators outlined in Attachment 1.
6. The mission notes that the Government is interested in insuring maximum reliability of the
power system in Thailand. The National Energy Policy Office (NEPO) has organized a
committee consisting of representatives from EGAT, MEA, PEA and NEPO to study and
analyze power system reliability issues. It is expected that the on-going study may result in
the formulation of a set of indices to monitor performance and reliability of the power system.
These indices may be available in future to serve as indicators to monitor performance and
reliability of the system.

B. Second Power System Develooment Proiect (Loan 31 38-TH)
7. The project has been completed satisfactorily. The production objectives for the Bang
Pakong Combined Cycle Blocks 3 and 4 (2x300 MW) and the Mae Moh Mine subproject
have been substantially achieved. The component of the project involving the construction
of a substation at South Thonburi has also been completed and is operating according to the
objectives expected for the component at appraisal. At this time, 87% of Loan 3138-TH has
been disbursed and it is expected that the loan will be fully disbursed by the closing date in
September 1994.
8. The mission and EGAT discussed future operations for the project, and agreed that the
benefits for the project can best be assessed by monitoring indicators for the subprojects as
shown in the operational plan outlined in Attachment 2. The mission notes that EGAT is
constructing a cooling water facility at the Bang Pakong Power Plant, which is due for
completion by 1995.  The objective for the facility is to lower the water temperature
discharged into the Bang Pakong river, so that the temperature differential between the
water at the discharge point at the plant and water far upstream or downstream in the river
may be lowered appreciably. Completion of this facility is expected to insure that the
discharged water from the plant will have minimal impact on the ecology of the river
adjacent to the plant.

The  Second  Central-Southern  Transmission Tie Line, covering one
230  kV  Prachuap  Khiri  Khan - Surat Thani line and expansion of
the  230  kV  substations,  was  to  reinforce the existing 113 hV

increasing  oi 12 transmission lines sith totai zine lengrh of 332
circuiF-km,  12'  new  substations, 2.10i) IVA tr-ansformers, .301 MVAII
shunt  reactors  and 3J .63 MVAR shunt capacitor. Consisting of 2
sub-projects,  Transmission system Expansion Project No.7, Part A.
was  located to have completion dates from M!arch 1989 to September
1992.  Project  Schedule  was  revised  during  implementation  to
expedite the subprojects which were more urgent needed.
However, the construction of two transmission lines was very late
from  the schedule set forth :113 kV Mae Moh 3 - Phayao, a portion
of the line penetrating into the conserved forest area while a
portion  of  113  kLV Tak 1- Xae Sot t'ransmission line passing into
the restricted area. The latter had to be withdrawn from the Loan
as clearance of line route could not be expected.
The  Transmission  System Expansion Project No.7, Part B. achie,;ed
the target to upgrade load dispatching centers all over the
country.  The  Project  was  7 months behind the original schedule
due to unforeseen delay on site test and commissioning.
The Second Central - Southern Tie Line strengthened the stability
and reliability of the tie line and could cope with the energy
demand  in Region 3. This Project was completed on March 25, 1990,
slightly later than the schedule.
The  300  kV Tha Talco-Nong Cholc Transmission Line !;as completed as
pianned  while  the  construction  of  Nong  Cholkc substation was 7
months  behind  the schedule. However, the late completion did not
affect-  the energy supply in the Greater Bangkok area.

B. Bank's Perf-ormance
Banlc's  work  plan  for  improvement   of   load  forceast  for
Thailand's electric system could be a guideline to adjust the load
forecast  of  the nation to be wore accurate.   Plan of action for Power
Tariff Restructuring in the Loan Agreement piayed a main role in
adJusting and restructuring the appropriate electricity tariffs which
refl-ected the financial statuts of power sub-sectors.
The  Bank has rendered EGAT the kind cooperation which make the

4.3  EGAT  has complied  with   the  requirements in the loan covenants
through out the period up to 1992 with a satisfactory self-
financing   rate   of  not  less  than  25  per  cent  of  capital
expenditures and a debt/equity ratio of not exceeding 1.5:1
4.4  To select the line routes and substation sites, EGAT tries to avoid
the impact on the environmental elements. In an unavoidable case,
the least impact is an essential objective.
3.  Conciusi on
The Projects are considerably achieved the goal to cope with the
increased   consumption   energy,   to  strengthen  the  stability  and
reliability  of power supply as well as to upgrade the load dispatching
centres  al'  over  the  country  and  to  improve  integration  of the
national  power grid,  although  TS7 Part A was siightlar delayed beyond
schedule due to right of way problem and cement shortage in 1989-1990.
To   expedite   the   transmission  system  construction,  EGAT
emphasises on contract oIt. proce(Lure on supply ar.d construct ion bassis.
This  strategy  is  to  build  up  the  local contractors to be able to
compete  against  the  foreign  contractors.   Of course,  competition
leads to less construction cost.

The right-of-way problem is the bottle neck of the transmission
line  construction work.  Apart from the problem faces with the pri-ate
land owners, the process until obtaining the concurrence from the
Gowernment   Agencies   concerned   takes   almost  two  years  if  the
enivironmenta'.  impact  study  is  required.   Sufficient time should be
provided for this phase of work in the future project scheaule plan.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
1.         The transmission project is part of EGAT's least cost expansion plan. To assess the
benefits for the project, an adjusted Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) is recalculated as an
approximation of the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) on the basis of incremental cost and benefit
streams associated with the 1987-96 EGAT's Power Development Plan.
2.         The basis for the re-evaluation of the IERR is similar to that used in the SAR. Capital
costs are the investment cost of plants, transmission system facilities and other associated investments
which were made during EGAT's Power Development Plan (1987-96). Fuel costs are based on actual
prices for the years 1987-94 and projected values from 1994 onwards. Economic costs of natural gas
are based on estimnates provided by the Petroleum Authority of Thailand. The economic price of lignite
is based on estimates of transfer prices and the price of petroleum fuels are based on international
prices. Operation, maintenance and investment costs are based on real costs up to the present.
Administrative and general expenses are based on actual costs in the first year and escalated at 3 % each
year subsequently.
3.         Energy sales are based on projected sales increases of 9% p.a to the year 1996. For the
period 1987-91, energy sales prices are valued at EGAT's average selling prices. Between 1992-94,
energy sales prices are based on a tariff structure put into effect in 1991. Beyond 1995, the selling
price for energy is escalated on the basis of a formula to realize a self-financing ratio (SFR) of 25% for
EGAT's investment program, based on a three year average of EGAT's investments.

completion cost is higher than the estimated cost for the LN 2915-TH pro4ec>..
2. With regard to the Rate of Return on Revalued A sets (<ORt,
we agree that the ROR of both projects for the first three years aere lo4er
than the covenanted parameter because remittances to the governmei:t werel
increased significantly.  However it should be noted that the inc eased I
remittance to the government up to at least 80 percent is one of the cri*terlia
for being a good state enterprise under the Ministry of Finance'sischeme 
This scheme provides many advantages to EGAT such as relaxing regplation
on salary and other remunerations.                                            l 7

3. For the calculation of Self-Financing RatIo (SFR;,
we would like to take this opportunity to request the Bank's views on
revenue fron sale of EGAT's power plants, as to whether this part Df
income should be included in non-operating income.
We hope that our coaentAs would be helpful to your repor s
and hope to hear from you soon.
Sincerely yours,
