MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIE PRESIDENT
OF TBE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCTIAON
TO THE EXEC  DIRECORS
ON A PROPOSD CREDIT TO INDI-
FOR A DISTRICT PRIMARY EDUCATION MPROJEC
1.                                                -iohe following mm m and reon on a propsed credt to India is
submtd fbr approvd. lhe credit, for SDR 180 million on standard IDA tms with 35 years
maturity, wold be for a project to help fince the newly estblished Distict Primary Educadon
Piogram (DPEP) of the Govem        of Idia (GOi). The DPEP would rapidly and substntially
expand the GOrs technical and fiancial support to stae for primay education development.
IDA    stanc for, this project would provide the financing and tehnicalcollaboration needed
to establish  nd develop national, state and disict capaciy for program planing and
management, as well as to lauch the DPEP in an inial 23 districts in six stes.
2.         Count ector                Inacuu.   h Idia, the outcomes of primary education, as
measured by lteracy siics, dropout rates and leanig achievement, are highly unsfacory.
Variation on these indicators, both between and win states, demonstrat  a subsantW degree
of regionl inequt. 'The effects of these disparities are readily seen in socia indicators. For
example, in the high literacy sta  of Keala, there are 1016 fmaes for every 1000 males, and
infat mortality is 28 per thousand births. By contast, in a low literacy state such as Bihar, there
are 930 females for every 1000 males, and the infant mortality rate is 117 per tmsand births.
3.         At a national level, household sample survey data show ta completig primary
education is ascated with significant Improvement in contraceptve use, pre-natal care and
child immunizaton among rural women On e basis of dropout rates alone, more than half of
rural gwils are leaving sdcool  l-ped to take advantage of these import  development
services. Although gaps in accss and completion have been closing in recen yeas, a
isproportIonate number of non-eolled and drop-outs natonwide are from the poorest
houseolds, gils, and members of Schedued Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Trie (STs).
4.         Hisly, prmary educaion has been prmariy a responsibility of state
goverments, which continue to provide more than 90 percent of system financimg. However,
begminng with the Nadonal Poicy on Education (NPE) in 1986, the cent  govenment has taken
steps to re ize and strnhen prmary education programs in the stes. Included have been
grant programs such as Opeon Blackboard (OBB), which pays for additional teachers and
basic learting materals for sigle teacher schools; District hiues of Educaion and Tragiing
(DIETS), which provide in-evice tng  and oer professional support to schools; and
Minmum Leveds of Leaning (MLL), a national curiculum renew R&D program.
S.         The Revised NPE and National Program of Action issued in 1992 recognize ta
additional inveqtme  from the GOI would be requied to reach medium term goals for
enrollments an learing ahievement, especialy for girls and SC and Sr students. The DPEP
has been established to implement the mvised policy in disricts with below average female
lieracy rates. Eight Plan alcatons for primary education have been increased four fold to
support DPEP, whih r s     an investm   program without precedent in India. Ihe
proposed project would be the fir in an anticipated series of thee or more additional credits

over the nen 6-10 years that would support the DPEP. Additional parallel financing for DPEP
b being provided by the European Community and is under consideaion by ODA.
6.                      e     . his projet nrporates key lessons lered from past-and
Ongoing DA social sector iesents, firom the implemenation of donor-assisted state primary
education projects in Andhra Pradesh (ODA), Bibar (UNICEF), _Rajastha (SI)A) and Uttar
Pradesh (IDA), and from eadier GOI schemes such as OBB: (a) the need for integred
education development programs that address biter-related costras on the availability and
quality of basic services; (b) the usefulness of formal annual reviews and work program proposas-
for   eme  coutrol; (c) the viability of regter  societies as    anisms for project
mplementation; and (d) the importance of strenghing the quality of ealy chidood educato,
tetbok and learning materas, and teacher in-service training. Expience with IDA-assisted
popWation and human resources projects in India has dtad  he imoancto efoctive
project magement of. (a) annual budget financing to cover anicipte project exptre;
0) clear medms for the advace  of funds and for timely compledon of disburement
requests; and (c) supportive  pervision from IDA, particularly in start-up phases of projects.
7.        IDA StW An RgknB   iQ      for Involvement. Background on the economy and on
Bank operations was distriuted in the Country Assistance Strategy Paper to the Board on Apri
21, 1994. Promoting economic reform, speeding economic growth and alleviating poverty are
central to IDA's country assistance strategy. Human resource development ls a key element of
his overall strategy, with education development playing a central role. IDA aims to Improve
the access of the poor, SCs, STs and women to invesment in uman resource developmen and
to improve the quality, efficiency and efectiveness of those investme. Low educatonal
achievement is a major constraint to social and economic improvement for the poor and socialy
disadvantaged groups.  IDA's segy for education is to focus mediumterm   assistance
exclusively on primary education, given its underdeveloped status in India, its high reuns, and
its importance to the poor. Previosm support for basic education in  da, consistet with the
objectives of this project, has been provided by IDA through the Socia Safety Net Adjustmet
Programi (Credit 2448-IN) and ftrough the Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Project (Credit 2509
IN). In the absece of contied IDA invlvement, the proposed DPEP mecms for
management, supervision and evaluation would be less well developed, and the quality of stae
and district-level project implementtion reduced.
S.                        . The project woud assist the Depatment of Education to buid
national, state and district _ial and professional capaciiy for sustanable primary education
development It would support districtbased activities aimed at decreasn dropout, iaing
learig achievement, and improving access to p y education. Prority would be give to
female and SC/ST stdents thrugh both targeting and special strateges, and to enhanced
community participation.
9.         SAgh. Ihe proposed IDA credit is a specific investment loan th
woud finance the development and opation of the DPEP Bureau in the G0I Deatment of
Education to cel technical and financia resources to states and disticts for locally planned
prmary school and system qualty improvement activies. DPEP woud provie sngle widow
enty for most external  a   t toprimay education  he crneit would also fiance an iitial
set of state capacitq building and district acvies in 23 districts (3-5 per state) in the states of
Assam, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Marasbtra, and Tamil Nadu.

ansion of national, se and distict components on the basis of performance. Developent
objectives and indicators woudd provide the overall framework for measurig pebmac.
Annual  tional, state and disticts work plans would provide the basis for annual resource
allocations and monitoring. The central cotol mechaism would be review of progress repot
coveing physical targets for civil works, procurement, and training; sfware and system
development; and expendite. The initia year of the project would be based on work plans and
budgets reviewed by IDA at appais, and would emphasize project lauh and start-up activities.
Project launch workshops would be caried out in each state and district Progm  magement

13.        Poia biuity. The budget inaes required to nsus   the project wold
average 1.4 percent of average non-lan budgets in the six states, and should be sustainable in
all cases. For Kanatka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Mabahtra, ihe increases required would
be less tham half of recent anmull increases. In Assam the cost requremt would be somehat
hiwer, requirig more significant budget adjustmet. The most sbst    required increase
woud be in Hayana, but would be wel withi the reach of Inas third-richest stae.
