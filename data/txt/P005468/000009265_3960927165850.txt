MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR AN
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Morocco for US$28.0 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would be for 20 years including a 5 year grace period with interest at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate ard will help finance an Agricultural
Research and Extension Project.
2.       Background.  Agriculture in Morocco accounts for some 17% of GDP and
15% of exports in 1989, and employs some 40% of the labor force. While growth
in the latter half of the seventies averaged 4.4% p.a., growth fell back to
1.02 in the eighties through 1985. The productivity of the sector has
remained well below potential due to: (a) succeseive droughts every other year
on average, over the last fifteen years; (b) poor performance of agricultural
research and absence of well defined extension systems; and (c) influence of
the macro-economic and sector-specific prices and incentives policies followed
by Government. Food production failed to keep pace with demand generated by
rapid population growth, high rate of urbanization and declining real prices
for food; food imports increased and self-sufficiency ratios fell to 60% for
cereals and 15% for edible oils. In response to the poor performance of the
sector, Government initiated a medium term sector adjustment program in 1985
with the objectives of: restructuring the investment program, correcting the
prices and incentives framework, building up institutional capacity for
agricultural planning and policy analysis, strengthening agriculture support
services including research and extension, and resolution of the basic issues
of improving productivity of land use and protecting the natural resources
base. The Bank has strongly supported this overall program through two
agricultural sector adjustment loans. Recent growth in exports and
productivity provides encouraging evidence that the adjustment program is
working.
3.       As part of the strengthening of agricultural support services,
critical steps to reorganize research and extension institutions using results
from previous Bank financed projects, have already been initiated and would be
further developed and completed by the proposed project. In 1984, Government
instigated the preparation of master plans for research and extension and has
3489E



-2-
accepted the main recommendations which include steps to: (a) focus research
work on crops that will enhance staple food production to improve
self-sufficiency and export potential; (b) reorganize the research services
and consolidate the research network; (c) develop more technical packages
meeting farmers' requirements; (d) reorganize extension services along the
lines of the Training and Visit system; (e) introduce a carefully designed
linkage between research and extension; and (f) for both research and
extension bring staff numbers up to the minimum level required, strengthen
training programs and improve career development. The setting up of a
coherent national research and extension program which followed acceptance of
these recommendations, provides an appropriate framework into which to fit the
various existing interventions and represents a major breakthrough in
institutional reform. Implementation of these recommendations has already
started on Bank financed irrigation and rainfed development projects, and will
be gradually applied nationwide. Given Government's financial constraints,
the immediate emphasis is on improving the efficiency of existing resources by
redeploying existing manpower. While disbursements on existing agricultural
projects have been slow in the past due primarily to these financial
constraints, following project restructuring and inclusion of the agricultural
portfolio in the core investment program which is being monitored under the
Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln 3001-MOR), they can be expected to pick up.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Improvement in technology generation
and transfer have been identified by Government and the Bank as key priorities
for further growth of the Moroccan agricultural sector. The Bank has been
closely involved in the steps taken during the past three years to prepare the
reform of research and extension institutions and a number of reforms have
already been implemented through: (a) the two agriculture sector adjustment
loans which tackle price policy and the improvement of supporting input supply
services; and (b) four rural development projects, a large scale irrigation
improvement project and 28 pilot extension centers (CT) throughout the
country, in which new extension techniques using the Training and Visit
contact group approach are being tested. The strengthening of national
research and extension institutions is fundamental to expanding agricultural
productivity and output, improving diversification and self-sufficiency and
increasing export earnings. While a good start has been made on initial
changes to the organizations, several years would be needed before the
necessary reforms are fully implemented and the commitment to this undertaking
should be for at least ten years. The Bank's involvement during preparation
has been instrumental in focussing Government agencies on the essential
elements of the overall agriculture strategy. The continuation of this
involvement both financially and through advice, is important for the
continued success of this strategy. Bank involvement is justified because it
would be available at a time when government is showing strong interest in
improving its critical financial situation and trying to alleviate the burden
of staple commodities imports. In addition, only the Bank can provide the
necessary financing and monitoring capacicy to carry out such a large project.
5.       Project Obiectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are to
establish efficient national research and extension institutions for the
development and dissemination of improved agricultural technology so as to
increase agricultural productivity, production of food, livestock and cash
crops, and farmers' inco-es throughout the country. The project would
reorganize and strengthen the National Institute for Agricultural Researth
(INRA) and the Ministry of Agriculture's Department of Extension and
3489E



-3-
Agrarian Reform (DVRA). A key objective would be improving liaison between
research, extension and training services and farmers as a necessary condition
to ensure proper orientation of research work and better and faster
transmission of suitable technical recommendations to farmers.
6.       Project description.  The project would comprise a first, five year
time slice of a ten year program to reform research and extension services.
The research component would include: (a) strengthening of INRA's management
structure; (b) development of programming by objectives for 5 research
priority areas including work on bread wheat, forage crops, livestock, oil
crops and olives; (c) decentralization of researr' management and development
of two regional research centers; (d) rehabilitation of 13 research farms; (e)
establishment of 8 research/development units; (f) strengthening of the
information/documentation division at INRA; (g) training, technical assistance
and fellowships; and (h) improvement of INRA's personnel and financial
management in liaison with measures taken under the second agricultural sector
adjustment loan. The extension component would be carried out through the
DVRA and the provincial agricultural extension services and would include:
(a) reorganizing extension services into a strong specialized service; (b)
implementation of new extension systems based on the Training and Visit
system; (c) training, technical assistance and fellowships; and (d)
establishing a monitoring and evaluation system. Institutional arrangements
for coordinating research and extension programs would be strengthened. The
project would provide funds for civil works, vehicles, furniture and
equipment, training, technical assistance and incremental operating costs and
staff. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$ 60.8 million with a
foreign exchange component of US$ 27.1 million. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A, amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in Morocco are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A rap is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6943-MOR (dated March 17 1989)
is being distributed separately.
7.       Agreed Actions.  The government has agreed on the following key
actions: (a) prepare by December 31, 1989, and implement upon their approval
by the appropriate authorities, proposals to align the remuneration of INRA's
research scientists with that of university faculty staff involved in
research; (b) implementation of a new budgetary, financing and accounting
system for INRA by March 31, 1990; (c) appointment of three accounting
controllers in regional research centers by December 31, 1989; (d) separation
of accounting for crop and seed multiplication from research on the INRA
research farms by March 31, 1990; (e) carrying out of the extension comporent
according to an implementation plan agreed with the Bank; and (f) annual
recruitment of adequate research personnel required to carry out research
programs. Issuance of the new accounting regulations for INRA would be a
special condition of effectiveness.
8.       Benefits.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are expected
from: (a) increase of the income of at least 130,000 small farmers; (b)
increase of food crop and livestock production; and (c) development of
agricultural exports. Since it is difficult to forecast the degree of success
and failure of research programs and separate the impact of extension input
34asE



-4-
from rainfall variations on production increases, it is impossible to quantify
benefits in precise terms and no attempt has been made to calculate a rate of
return.
9.       Risks.  Possible risks would derive from: (a) budgetary shortfalls;
and (b) failure to retain trained research and extension staff. Considerable
efforts have been made recently to reduce the funding risks on key agriculture
projects by inclsding them, and the proposed project, as part of a targetted
core program monitored under the Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln. 3001-MOR).
The project has also been designed to redeploy existing staff and to tbereby
limit additional staff numbers. Also, the provision of bilateral cofiiancing
will ease Government's financial burden. The risk of losing trained research
staff upon completion of their training abroad has been minimized by requiring
trainees to work for IINRA for a fixed time. Moreover, measures taken to raise
the remuneration levels for INRA scientists to those comparable with the
university faculty members involved in research, should help to attract and
retain the required high quality staff. The risk that extension staff will
lose momentum in the face of difficulties in transferring new messages will be
minimized by the strong training program to be implemented with the support of
subject matter specialists.
10.      Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed project would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
