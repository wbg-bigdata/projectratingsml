I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
The Sector in the Economy
1.01      Agriculture continues to be an important sector in the Brazilian
economy, employing 36.2% (14.6 million) of the economically active popula-
tion (1976) and contributing about 12% of the total GDP and 56% of total
export earnings. Brazil is the world's largest exporter of coffee and
orange juice, the largest producer of sugar cane, and the third largest
producer of soybeans. Other major agricultural exports include meat and
fish products, cotton, maize, peanuts, cocoa, castor oil, and sisal. The
most important products for the domestic market include cassava, maize,
rice, wheat, beans, potatoes, vegetables, bananas, citrus fruit, dairy
products, poultry, beef and pork; coffee, sugar, soybeans, cotton and
cocoa are also important. Brazil is largely self-sufficient in basic food
production, except wheat, more than half of which is still imported.
1.02      From 1970-74, the agricultural sector performed well in meeting
domestic demand for food and fibers as well as in supplying an increasing
volume of export commodities. During the period, the average annual growth
rate was 6.9%. Until 1978, the value of agricultural production continued to
grow, although at a lower rate than that of the industrial sector or the GDP
as a whole. In 1978, agricultural output declined by 2%, largely due to a
severe drought in the south resulting in substantial crop losses. In 1979,
the agricultural sector showed a 3.5% growth rate, compared to 6.5% for the
industrial sector and 6% for the economy as a whole.
1.03      Despite productivity gains, expanded production areas, and increased
market integration, much of the sector continues to employ traditional agricul-
tural practices and rudimentary technology. Constraints on increased agricul-
tural production, particularly for small farmers, include: limited access to
institutional credit, extension, and modern agricultural inputs; lack cf
supporting services, such as marketing, storage, and transport facilities;
uncertain land tenure and a highly uneven agricultural land distribution; and
the absence of a stable price policy and adequate mechanisms to provide
incentives for agricultural producers. Reflecting these problems, outmigra-
tion from rural areas has led to accelerated urban growth, placing even
greater demands on the Brazilian agricultural sector.
Government Agricultural Policy
1.04      Agricultural development has been assigned a high priority in
Brazil's Third National Development Plan (1980-84). Major policy objec-
tives include: (a) increased basic staple and export production, with
special emphasis on small and medium producers; (b) the creation of an
integrated system of production, storage, transport and marketing; (c) the
expansion of agricultural research activities and the increased use of
modern inputs and appropriate technology; and (d) the decentralization of
agricultural policy execution, increasing the participation of the private
sector and state and local governments. Recent measures have tended to



confirm the government's commitment toward stimulating agricultural production
and raising rural incomes, particularly among small producers. These measures
have included: (a) the strengthening of the research and extension services
with a new emphasis on the needs of small farmers; (b) the support of special
regional programs, such as the Development Program for Integrnted Areas in
the Northeast (POLONORDESTE), that focus on poorer regions and small-scale
farmers; and (c) the announcement of a series of actions (pacote agricola) in
May 1979, which included increased access to institutional credit. However,
Brazil's high inflation rate and large public sector deficit during the late
1970s are forcing the government to restrain public expenditure and interest
rate subsidies. In December 1979, a new economic package was announced, which
lowered the interest rate subsidy on agricultural credit. The package also
removed export subsidies and included a 30% devaluation of the cruzeiro.
These measures, partially aimed at stimulating agricultural export growth, and
introduction of a large-scale alcohol production program demanding increased
cultivation of sugarcane, demonstrate new economic priorities.
Bank Involvement in the Agricultural Sector
1.05       The Bank has so far made 18 loans, totalling US$625.7 million,
for agriculture and rural development in Brazil. These include two, amounting
to US$125.3 million, for agro-industries; two, totalling US$60.5 million, for
livestock development; one for US$18.2 million for grain storage; one for
US$40 million for agricultural research; one for US$100 million to improve
agricultural extension services; and eleven, totalling US$281.7 million for
various settlement, irrigation and rural development projects, nine of which
are located in the Northeast. Five additional agricultural and rural develop-
ment operations are currently at a relatively advanced state of preparation:
two rural development projects and a agricultural credit project in the
Northeast; a second agricultural research project and a Northwest agricultural
development project. Additional agricultural and rural development projects
are under consideration for possible future Bank financing. Completion
reports have been issued for the grain storage and the two livestock develop-
ment projects.
II. THE STATE OF MINAS GERAIS AND THE PROJECT AREA
A. The State
Location and Natural Features
2.01       Minas Gerais is the sixth largest state in Brazil.  Centrally located
with a total area of 587,170 km (7% of Brazil), its natural resource base,
has favored mining, industrial, and livestock development. The state possesses
diverse ecological areas, ranging from the tropical, dry northern plains to
the sub-tropical moderately humid south, and from the mountainous east to the
mid-western plains. Rainfall is closely related to changes in altitude, which



ranges from 200 to 2,000 m above sea level. The most important climatic factor
is the duration of the dry period, varying from three months in the south and
east to seven months in the north and west. The s?ate's capital, Belo Horizonte,
with a population of about 3 million in a 3,000 km metropolitan area, is
centrally located in relation to Brazil's other major cities: Sao Paolo
(586 km away), Rio de Janeiro (482 km), and Brasilia (600 km).
Social and Economic Conditions
2.02      The state has a total population of about 13 million (1977), of
which 37% is rural. While urban population is growing at an average annual
rate of 4%, rural population is decreasing at an average annual rate of 1.51%.
In the period from 1970-77, outmigration from the state's rural areas totalled
some 2.3 million persons, one million of whom left the state completely.
About 31% of the economically active population is occupied in industry, 1%
in mining, 37% in agriculture and 31% in the service sector. In 1978, agri-
culture contributed 14% to the total state GDP; industry, 35%; mining, 3%; and
the service sector, 48%. Average per capita income in 1976 was approximately
US$1,280. However, it is estimated that the poorest 50% of the population, a
large part of which is rural, had an average annual income of about US$300,
below the Brazilian relative poverty level (US$330). In 1970, 69% of the
state's population had no access to potable water, and 59% had no electricity.
These percentages are far greater in rural areas. Of the population 10 years
of age and older, 67% had less than a primary school education, and students
from rural areas accounted for only 24% of total enrollment. In general, the
state is characterized by wide regional disparities, with the rural areas of
the north and northeast of the state showing the lowest degree of socio-
economic development.
Agricultural Production
2.03      The state's average annual growth rate for 1970-78 was 10.2%, but in
1978 the state achieved only a 3.4% rate of growth. While clearly reflecting
economic problems of a national scope, the declining growth rate in Minas
Gerais was also related to the poor performance of the agricultural sector.
The average annual growth rate for the sector during 1970-1978 was only 4.5%,
and in 1978, the value of agricultural output declined by 10%. The limited
use of modern technology and the lack of a stable price policy and of comple-
mentary services such as storage and marketing facilities continue to be major
contributing factors to the worsening agricultural situation. Agricultural
land (42 million ha), including forests and natural pastures, accounts for
more than 70% of the state's total land area. Natural pastures comprise 62%
of total agricultural land. Cropped lands are 8% of the total, with some
57,000 ha of irrigated lands. Average farm size is approximately 92 ha, but
82% of all farms, accounting for 23% of total agricultural land and almost
half of all cropped lands, have areas of less than 100 ha. Some 85% of the
state's farms are owner-operated, with the remainder under various forms of
tenancy or sharecropping arrangements. While coffee, cotton, soybeans and
sugarcane are the most important commercial crops, large quantities of beans,
corn and rice are also grown within the state, mainly for domestic consumption.
Livestock and milk production contribute almost 50% of the total value of

average growth rate of only 1.8% in 1970-1978. Forestry production, largely a
result of significant reforestation investments, is currently the most rapidly
growing subsector, accounting for approximately 13% of the state's total
agricultural production.
Rural Development
2.04      In the past, little attention was paid to Minas Gerais' small
farmers. However, the worsening situation in the agricultural sector and
the increase in rural outmigration coupled with changing national policies
emphasizing the importance of small-scale agriculture, have recently focused
more attention on small farmers. Public investment in agriculture (Cr$1.4
billion in 1979) remained relatively steady at about 3% of total state
expenditures during the period 1977-79. Part of this expenditure financed
several rural and regional development projects, including: (a) Gorutuba,
part of the POLONORDESTE program; (b) "POLOCENTRO", an infrastructure, credit
and technical assistance program, in the central and northwestern regions of
the state; (c) Geoeconomica de Brasilia, designed to restrict rural flight
to Brasilia by bringing improved public services and productive opportunities
to the surrounding rural populations; and (d) PROTDEVALE, a series of physical
infrastructure and social service projects in the Jequitinhonha Valley, one of
the state's poorest rural areas. To date, however, the Bank-financed First
Rural Development Project in Minas Gerais (PRODEMATA) 1/, initiated in 1977,
is the state's most comprehensive effort aimed specifically at improving
economic and social conditions for the rural poor. By the end of its implemen-
tation period, it is hbped that the project will have benefitted some 25,500
small farmers. Partially based on the successful experience of the PRODEMIATA
project (Annex 1, gives details), high priority has been assigned in the
state's Third Economic and Social Development Plan (1980-83) to increasing
agricultural productivity among small farmers and improving the standard of
living of the state's rural poor.
B. The Project Area
Location
2.05      The region in which the project would be located covers the entire
eastern portion of the state, comprising almost 50% of total state area. This
region contains four sub-regions, Nordeste, Vale Rio Doce, Zona da Mata, and
Sul de Minas, each with distinct physical and social-economic characteristics
(Annex 2, Table 1). Within these sub-regions, 102 municipalities were selectd
based on agricultural potential and a high degree of small farmer concentration
(para 4.06). These municipalities, covering some 61,000 km2, constitute the
specific project area. (Map IBRD 14693)

Natural Features and Climate
2.06      The project area is ecologically quite diverse, with the following
major sub-areas: (a) the northern cerrado, with acidic soils of limited
fertility (40% of the total project area); (b) the more humid, hilly lands of
the south and southeast Zona da Mata, with a variety of soil types (37%);
(c) the grasslands (campos) at higher elevations in the south and the Vale Rio
Doce, with sandy, gravelly, or rocky soils (8%); and (d) floodplains (varzeas)
located throughout the project area (15%). The mean annual rainfall increases
from 500 mm in the north to over 2,000 mm in the southeast. However, the
pattern is discontinuous, with enclaves of higher rainfall near mountain
ridges and escarpments (see Map IBRD 14693). The dry season increases to the
west and north, ranging from three to seven months per year, and is concen-
trated between May and September. The annual hydrological deficit is almost
zero in the south and southeast and increases to 500 mm per year in the far
north. Mean annual temperatures range from 24.5 C in the north to 20 C in
the south and southeast, with 17.5 C in the mountain areas, where minimum
temperatures below zero occur. The annual average of the relative humidity
ranges from 70% in the north to 85% in the humid areas in the south.
Socio-econmic Conditions
2.07      The population of the proje2t area is about 1 2million (1978).  The  2
average population density of 15.5/km  varies from 5/km  in the north to 62/km
in the most populous southeastern municipality. The overall annual population
growth rate in the area is about 0.15%, compared with 1.6% for the state.
Rural population is steadily decreasing, indicating a rapid emigration to
urban areas, mainly outside of the project area. Urban population in the
project area only increased from 25% of total population in 1970 to 29%
(1977). The population is young, with 45% under the age of 15. The average
family composition of about 5.0 persons is similar to that found in other
less developed rural areas in the state and in Brazil. The table below
provides details:

2.08      Agriculture is the chief economic activity of the area.  The per-
centage of the economically active population engaged in agriculture has
remained relatively stable (75%), while the percentage engaged in industry
(8%) has increased rapidly. Among the rural population, members of small farm
families typically have per capita incomes of about US$200 per annum. Income
of dairy farmers or those with about 50 ha of land using some improved
technology, rises to about US$400 per capita.
Land Distribution
2.09      Land distribution in the project area is skewed, with about 82% of
the farmers cultivating 25% of the farm area. Average farmsize is about 40 ha,
but about 42% of the farmers have less than 10 ha. Details are given below.

Land distribution is also marked by regional differences. The dry northeast
has more large holdings, with small farmers located along the fringes of the
varzeas. The Vale Rio Doce has fewer farms under 10 ha. In the densely
populated Zona da Mata, fragmented holdings predominate. In the south, where
there are more large holdings, there are also substantial poverty pockets of
small farmers who originally migrated from neighbouring areas with large
plantation or commercial enterprises.
Agricultural Land Use and Production
2.10      Relative to its size and population, the general region in which
project municipalities are located is the most important agricultural area of
the state (para 2.05). The region produces 60 to 70% of the Minas Gerais
agricultural production, excluding manioc and cotton. The 102 selected
municipalities of the project area cover about 10% of the state, but only
produce approximately 8% of the state's agricultural production, excluding
cotton, beans and pigs (Annex 2, Table 2). Low production levels are chiefly
the result of a lack of infrastructure and public services and the low level
of technology employed. Since the ecological conditions do not differ much
from those in other parts of the region, there is a distinct margin for
agricultural development. About 70% of the project area, or 4.2 million ha,
is cultivable land. About 8% of cultivable land is under forest, with 2% in
permanent crops, 12% in temporary crops, 60% in pasture land, 10% in fallow,
and 8% not utilized. About 0.1% is irrigated. Herbaceous cotton is exclusively
grown in the northeast, and garlic cultivation is best suited to the northeast
and Vale Rio Doce. Beans, maize and manioc are often grown in mixed cropping
systems and cover 63% of the cropped area. Coffee (13%) and sugarcane (5%)
are also important. Fruit and vegetable cultivation (3%) is expanding as is
rice cultivation (13%) on land reclaimed from varzeas. All farmers, including
cattle farmers, grow some or all of the basic food crops, but generally the
larger farmers concentrate on cattle. Farmers having less than 50 ha produce
the bulk of the food crops for sale in the urban centers. Virtually all small
farmers in the area have some livestock, especially pigs.
Agricultural Services
2.11      Agricultural extension services are mainly credit-oriented and
favor larger farmers in the project area. EMATER-MG (the State Technical
Assistance and Rural Extension Service) has established local offices in
24 out of the 102 municipalities of the area. In 1979 about 45% of rural
credit was granted for livestock (generally on large and medium scale farms )
and 60% went in large loans to 10% of the borrowers. Agricultural credit is
channeled principally through agencies of the government owned banks.
Fifty of the 102 municipalities of the area have a local bank agency, but only
in 37 municipalities are large numbers of small farmers operating within a
20-km range of these facilities. The State Agricultural Trade Company (CAMIG)
is the main agricultural input supplier in only five of the project area
municipalities. Similarly, the state-operated storage system is underdevel-
oped in the area. Because public marketing services do not reach the small
farmer effectively, private intermediaries remain the major link between
farmers and markets.



-8-
Industry
2.12      The industrial development in the project area is mainly limited to
cottage industries and concentrates on food processing and artisan works. At
present, there are an estimated 2,400 non-registered and 1,200 registered
small enterprises, each employing an average of about 2 to 3 persons. Nearby
industries in the region, such as the Vale Rio Doce mining centers, also have an
impact on the project area, providing additional employment opportunities for
area residents.
Physical Infrastructure
2.13      The federal and state road system is well developed in the south and
east of the project area, but less developed in the north where 26 project
municipalities are not linked up to it. Feeding into the primary road system
is a municipal road network of about 20,000 km of generally poorly maintained
roads. Many communities are isolated and are connected to the municipal roads
only by farm tracks. The municipal centers of the project area are served by
CEMIG (Minas Gerais Electrification Company) and DAE (State Water and Electric
Energy Agency). About 16% (1970) of all houses in the project area had
electricity, but only 3% of the rural properties were served. Of the 102
municipal centers, 18 are served by COPASA (State Sanitation Company). Of
the 622 rural communities in the area, about 25 have simple water supply
systems. About 15% of all houses in the area receive water from public
systems, private wells or nearby springs. Some 49 municipal centers have
some form of solid wa te disposal system, and about 10% of all homes have
some sanitary installition.
Social Services
2.14      Health and education services, although improved in the Zona da
Mata area, are generally weak in the project area. Only 70% of the school age
children attend school. The literacy rate is low. There are about 2,100
primary schools, with 86% offering only grades 1 to 4, and there are 32
secondary schools in the 102 municipalities of the project area, none of which
offers agricultural education.  However, in   nearby areas of the region, there
are one agricultural university (Vicosa), one agricultural technical school
(Lavras), and five agricultural secondary schools. Infant mortality is high
(100 per thousand) and malnutrition is widespread. Incidence of communicable
diseases is high, due to poor hygienic conditions and inadequate housing.
Schistosomiasis is encountered in most of the municipalities, and Chagas
disease (South American trypanosomiasis) affects 19% of the population,
contributing to the low life expectancy of about 44 years (against 55 for the
state). The area has about one hospital bed per 1,000 inhabitants. There are
35 hospitals in or near the project area and 98 health centers and 120 rural
health posts in the project area. The medical coverage of the population is
estimated at 30% and the immunization rate at 10%.

III. THE EXECUTING AGENCIES
State Framework for Coordinating the Rural Development Program
3.01      The state has developed a Rural Development Program (Programa de
Assistencia de Produtores de Baixa Renda) which consists of various rural
development projects, including one in the northwest with IDB financing and
recently one in the north (1979) under the POLONORDESTE program. The central
coordinating agent of the early projects, including the Bank-financed Zona de
Mata Rural Development Project, is RURALMINAS (Rural Development Foundation
in Minas Gerais), an agency linked to the Secretariat of Agriculture. Since
an increasing number of public institutions have participated in these proj-
ects and in the state's Rural Development Program, the Secretariat of Agricul-
ture itself has now been designated as the primary coordinating agent for
rural development in the state. Each participating agency has a manager
appointed for each project in which it participates. The managers oversee
the implementation of the components their agencies are in charge of, monitor
implementation progress, and prepare the annual operational plan. Inter-
institutional integration is the responsibility of the project coordinator in
the Secretariat of Agriculture. The Secretariat of Planning retains overall
control of the state program and administers program and project funds.
Institutions Engaged in Rural Development in the Project Area
3.02      The Secretariat of Agriculture carries out its executing task
through the Agricultural Sector Operational System (SOAPA), consisting of the
State Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Company (EMATER-MG); the State
Agricultural Research Company (EPAMIG); the State Superintendency of Coopera-
tives (SUDECOOP); the State Forestry Institute (IEF); the State Agricultural
Trading Company (CAMIG); the State Commission for Seeds and Nurseries (COSEMEG);
the State Storage Company (CASEMG); and RURALMINAS. Other agencies involved
in rural development in the project area are: the Government-owned Bank of
Brazil (BB) and the State Savings Bank (CEE), the State Credit Bank (BCR), the
State Bank of Minas Gerais (BEMG) and the State Development Bank (BDMG); the
Secretariats of Education (SEE), Labor, Social Action and Sports (SETAS)
and Health (SES); the State Highway Department (DER-MG); and the State Water
and Electric Energy Agency (DAE). Further support comes from a wide range of
public agencies and programs involved in rural development such as the Program
for the Execution of Health and Sanitation Activities (PIASS), the National
Department for Water Supply and Sanitation Works (DNOS), the National
Department for Anti-Drought Works (DNOCS), the National Highway Department
(DNER), and the Center for Assistance to Small and Medium Entreprises (CEAG-MG),
as well as from private or semi-private companies, such as the Minas Gerais
Electrification Company (CEMIG) and cooperative organizations. The overall
effectiveness of these agencies in rural areas was initially hampered by
limited resources, administrative constraints, inadequate coordination, and,
in some cases, relatively little field experience. In the past some agencies
have developed an implementation capability more rapidly than others, which in
turn accentuated the need for improved inter-agency integration. As the
various projects developed, the state took corrective steps and promoted better



- 10 -
integration, and the institutions involved have adjusted themselves success-
fully. Several additional institutions will be included in the proposed new
project, such as the Secretariat of Labor, Social Action and Sports, DER-MG
and CAMIG, which would have to adjust their implementation capabilities to
the project requirements, but the State and the institutions 1-ve so far
demonstrated a capacity to address rural development project issues success-
fully.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Origin
4.01      The state has assigned high priority to assisting low income rural
producers, and it has initiated various programs for rural development (para
2.04). Because of the positive results of the Bank-financed rural development
project in the Zona de Mata (para 4.03) and the state's desire to extend
similar benefits to other poor, rural areas, the state requested Bank assis-
tance in March 1979 for the preparation and implementation of a rural develop-
ment program of wider scope. The Bank agreed to do so for regions in the
state with a high concentration of low income producers and with sufficient
productive potential. The project was prepared between July and December 1979
by the State Planning Institute (Fundacao Joao Pinheiro) in close collaboration
with the Bank and the future implementing agencies (Annex 3).
B. Design
4.02      The project would build on the experience of the Bank's First
Rural Development project in Minas Gerais and rural development projects in
other parts of Brazil. Problems and issues highlighted in those projects have
been taken into account, and wherever possible, corrective measures have been
incorporated into project design.
4.03      The First Rural Development Project in Minas Gerais, initiated in
1977, has the objective of assisting 25,500 small farmers in the Zona da Mata
area. The project, including rural credit, agricultural support services, and
social and physical infrastructure investments, is expected to be completed on
schedule (December 31, 1981), and is substantially achieving its objectives
(Annex 1). The project has, however, raised some issues which are related to
three main aspects: (a) selection of project components; (b) start-up problems
in project Implementation, and (c) integration of project activities. First,
the Zona da Mata project did not include marketing and feeder road components.
The lack of adequate feeder roads has, in some cases, limited the full partici-
pation of isolated communities and the lack of proper marketing services has
reduced the impact of efforts to actively involve farmers' communities and
farmer groups in the development process. The proposed project would include
selected feeder road and marketing investments and provide for a pilot com-
munity development component. Second, some initial difficulties in project
implementation were experienced due to the lack of participation of operational



- 11 -
personnel in project preparation. The proposed project has involved a cross-
section of personnel from the participating agencies in project preparation
and appraisal. The first project's coordinating unit also had to dedicate
much time to the establishment of a monitoring structure. The proposed
project would benefit from this pioneering work and would further improve the
usefulness of monitoring to project managers. Finally, the first project
highlighted the need for better integration within and between the executing
agencies. During project design, special attention was given to institution
building, internal information systems of the agencies, and interagency
cooperation. Features such as formal agreements regulating inter-agency
cooperation and an administrative system for the community centers to be used
by various participating agencies, would strengthen these aspects of the
project.
4.04      Experiences from other completed rural development projects were
also taken into account during project design. Although many of these proj-
ects were smaller and included less products and components, they have indi-
cated several issues which are relevant for the proposed project. These
issues include: (a) the tendency for overly optimistic appraisal estimates
of the execution capacity and the rate of productivity increases; (b) the
importance of project flexibility to adjust to important changes in circum-
stances, while maintaining basic project objectives; (c) the need for strong
political commitment from the State and Federal Government; (d) the need to
focus directly on the lowest income strata of the target group; and (e) the
need to involve target group beneficiaries, families, and communities more
actively in project implementation. Project preparation and design have
addressed these issues in the following manner: (a) generally conservative
yield estimates have been applied and targets have been set in accordance
with the implementation capability of the participating agencies and the
absorption capacity of the target group; (b) project administration and
monitoring activities have been designed to ensure timely data collection and
a proper feedback of information to the local executive level, in order to
ensure as much flexibility as possible; (c) political commitment has been
tangibly demonstrated during project preparation, particularly through the
active involvement of government officials on all levels; (d) project actions
were aimed at the poorest rural inhabitants of the project area by setting
maximum income or property limits for participation in certain project activi-
ties; and (e) project design has included provisions for improved social
extension services, assistance for farmer associations, and community develop-
ment activities.
C. Objectives and Strategy
4.05      The proposed project would support state policy which gives priority
to increasing productivity and raising living standards in rural poverty
areas. Taking advantage of the project area's development potential, a broad
range of project activities would be directed to specific target groups of
low-income, small producers. Project objectives include:
(a) increased production and productivity in agriculture and small
non-farm enterprises;



- 12 -
(b) increased rural per capita income levels and rural employment
opportunities, improved income distribution, and the dampening
of rural-urban migration;
(c) improved physical and social infrastructure;
(d) increased local participation in the execution of project
activities; and
(e) improved institutional capability in project execution, monitoring
and evaluation.
4.06      The project would operate in a wide region (50% of the state) where
most low-income producers are found. Project activities would be concentrated
on selected "development pockets," 102 municipalities, with the highest
concentration of small, low-income producers. It is expected that the activi-
ties in the development pockets would have a demonstration effect on surround-
ing areas, serving as a catalyst for the expansion of rural development
activities throughout the project region and eventually throughout the state.
Concurrently, the project's emphasis on institution building would improve the
general effectiveness and implementation capabilities of the participating
institutions.
D. Brief Description
4.07      The project would include the following activities:
(a) the provision of agricultural medium and long term credit to 30,000
small farmers (including sharecroppers and tenants), with less than
100 ha of land, living on or near their farms and obtaining more
than 50% of family income from agricultural activities, and the
provision of rural credit for electrification of about 5,500 small
farms;
(b) the strengthening of land titling services, agricultural extension,
agricultural research, and storage and marketing services;
(c) the provision of special support for reforestation (10,000 ha) on
about 4,100 small farms and reclamation of swampland (6,000 ha) on
about 1,800 small farms;
(d) the promotion of cooperative development, assisting about 14 agri-
cultural cooperative societies, 350 farmer groups and 120 pre-
cooperatives, reaching a total of about 9,000 farmers;
(e) the provision of technical assistance to about 1,100 small non-farm
enterprises, each with less than 10 employees, fixed assets of less
than 300 MVR I/ and annual sales of less than 600 MVR;
1/   The MVR (maior valor de referencia), established in 1975, is a standard
unit of value used in various financial transactions. Originally
based on the minimum wage, it is now adjusted periodically. One MVR
equaled Cr$1,962.20 or US$46.35 as of January 1, 1980.



- 13 -
(f) the improvement of the municipal road network through systematic
maintenance, upgrading about 3,360 km of municipal roads and
constructing about 100 km of roads connecting isolated comuni-
ties, and the installation of telephone communication in 34
municipalities.
(g) the strengthening of community development, education and health
services, including the construction or rehabilitation of community
centers, schools, village health centers, water supply systems and
sanitation installations; and
(h) the provision of project management, including administration,
monitoring and evaluation.
4.08      The size of the area operated by the project beneficiaries would
vary from less than one to as much as 100 ha, depending on the region. In the
southern regions of Zona da Mata and Sul de Minas, which currently possess
stronger infrastructure and support services, farmers cultivating more than 50
ha would not be direct project beneficiaries (except for reforestation assis-
tance). The distribution of expected direct farmer beneficiaries by farm size
is given in the following table.

By the project's fifth year, 37% of the small farmers in the project munici-
palities would have benefitted from project assistance, with a higher rate for
landowners (up to 40%) and a lower rate for landless farmers (about 20%). The
incremental number of farmers directly assisted annually, would increase from
2,000 in the first year to 8,000 in the fourth and fifth years of the project.

E. Detailed Description
Credit
4.09      Agricultural Credit.  Use by small, low-income farmers of insti-
tutionalized credit would be expanded significantly. The project would
finance medium and long-term credit to establish permanent crops; to make
on-farm improvements such as on-farm storage installations and stables; to
improve pasture; to purchase livestock, when part of an integral crop and
livestock farm development plan; and to undertake reforestation and land
reclamation. In the sub-areas of the Northeast and Vale Rio Doce, credit
would be made available to farmers with less than 100 ha, and in the Zona da
Mata and Sul de Minas, to farmers with less than 50 ha, since in the latter
regions, farmers with more than 50 ha generally have access to normal credit
channels.  For reforestation credit, the farm size limit would be uniformly
100 ha throughout the project area. To complement the project financing of
medium and long-term credit, the state government would take all steps necessary
on its part to assure the adequate provision, through the participating banks,
of seasonal credit to the project beneficiaries (para 4.12).
4.10      The credit would be administered by the BB and four state banks
through 57 existing agencies and advance credit posts and at least 20 planned
new posts. During negotiations assurances were obtained from the State that it
would promote the establishment of the new posts not later than June 30, 1982.
Credit procedures would be simplified, based on experience under the first
project and new federal regulations. Credit terms and conditions for project
participants would be the same as for standard rural credit lines. The
effective interest rate for 1980 will be 29% for investment credit, with
repayment terms for the latter up to 10 years, including a grace period of up
to six years in the case of reforestation. Seasonal credit, not financed
under the project, currently bears an interest rate of 24%. The repayment of
seasonal credit, normally within 60 days of harvest, would depend on the
production cycle of the crop produced. Although rural credit interest rates
remain negative in real terms, they reflect almost a doubling from the rates
in effect prior to December 1979 (13-15%). The increase, although modest, is
an important tangible step in the Government's stated plan to gradually reduce
the implicit interest rate subsidy by increasing the nominal interest rates
simultaneous to other parallel actions to reduce inflation. In view of this,
and the fact that project credit would be closely directed to beneficiaries in
the lower income classes, the Bank should be prepared to acquiesce to the rate
structure. Furthermore, the project's extension and monitoring activities
would minimize the possibility of resource misallocation.
4.11      Project investment credit would be available for up to 100% of total
costs of the investment. Seasonal credit (not financed under the project)
would be available for up to approximately 70% of total production costs
including labor. Project credit would be limited to farmers with a total of
less than 100 MVR 1/ indebtedness, except in the cases of land reclamation,
with significantly higher crop yields, electrification and charcoal production,
where it would be 180 MVR.
1/   Equivalent to about US$4,600.  See also note on page 12.



- 15 -
4.12      During negotiations assurances were obtained from the State that it
would: (a) provide, or make necessary arrangements for the provision of,
funds to finance through the participating banks seasonal short-term credit
required by the Project beneficiaries for annual crops and the establishment
of two-year crops; (b) add financial agents only with prior Bank approval; and
(c) inform the Bank of any change in lending terms or conditions. The receipt
by the Bank of signed arrangements between the State and the financial agents
ensuring the collaboration of the agents in the execution of the project,
would be a condition of disbursement for the credit component.
4.13      Rural Electrification Credit.  The project would provide rural electric
service in 32 municipalities of the project area, to an estimated 5,500 farms
of 100 ha or less. This represents about 16% of the target population in the
related area. The project rural credit would finance branch distribution
lines and transformers and meter installations. The terms and conditions for
this credit would be the same as those stipulated for agricultural credit
(para. 4.09-4.12). The cost of the required additional trunk lines (US$7
million) representing 40% of total network costs, would be financed by the
State Government. In-house wiring and farm equipment would be the farmers'
own responsibility. According to past experience, the total number connected
over time increases (by 30% or more) when benefits become visible to initial
non-participants. Therefore, costs per connections should decrease over time.
4.14      The executing agencies would be CEMIG and DAE.  CEMIG supplies 80%
of the electrical energy in the state and DAE has had ample experience in
providing electrical service in remote areas. The user rates charged would
be in accordance with those applicable elsewhere in the state. Operations in
rural areas would be initially supported by the revenues from higher urban
tariffs. However, past experience in Minas Gerais indicates that in rural
areas with a high development potential, such as the selected municipalities,
revenues would eventually cover operating and maintenance costs. During
negotiations assurances were obtained from the State that (a) the necessary
funds would be made available to the executing agencies for the timely construc-
tion of necessary trunklines; (b) the average costs per km of distribution
line (including trunk and branch lines) would not exceed US$3,400; and (c) the
average costs per KVA of transformer and meter installation would not exceed
US$100.
Agricultural Services
4.15      Land Titling Services.  The project would provide land titles
to about 9,000 small farmers, thereby improving security of tenure and
the access to institutional credit. The executing agent would be RURALMINAS.
The project would finance salaries of incremental staff, cars, equipment and
materials for land surveying and the preparation of documents, and the costs
of legal procedures and advice.
4.16      RURALMINAS is authorized by State law to legitimize and regularize
land ownership in Minas Gerais. Since 1966, it has legitimized 2,700 land
titles covering about 2.8 million ha. However, the situation in the three
northern sub-areas of the project remains unsatisfactory, with about 50% of
the lands owned by small farmers lacking proper land titles. RURALMINAS



- 16 -
currently operates with about 100 technicians and 14 local offices in the
project area. Only a relatively small increase in staff and equipment would
be needed for the additional project activities, which would include a special
promotion campaign during the first year. Although project beneficiaries
would contril- te a nominal fee of about 5% of total costs, the state intends
to waive a traditionally required payment of about US$10 per ha for the
titling of lands officially belonging to the state (e.g., untitled lands
farmed by long-time squatters).
4.17      Agricultural Extension.  The project would expand extension services
in the 78 municipalities of the project area which now receive no or minimal
service. It would also improve the quality of extension services by intensive
retraining, assigning extensionists to specific municipal areas, and focussing
on farm management problems. In addition, the extension service would actively
participate in the activities under the credit, land reclamation, cooperative,
community development and marketing components. The project would provide for:
(a) establishment of 18 new local offices and the increase of the number of
agricultural extensionists to 143 (from 43) and of social extensionists to 93
(from 13); (b) the improvement of communication services with local offices;
(c) the training of extensionists, farmers, and farm family members; (d) the
employment of about 12 extensionists to assist specifically land reclamation
under the project, and (e) establish a permanent staff of technicians for
project marketing activities (para. 4.28). Salaries of incremental staff,
incremental operating costs, cars, and the costs of training would be financed
under the project.
4.18      The executiTg agent would be EMATER-MG.  EMATER-MG gained consider-
able experience during the first project in reaching small farmers and,
particularly, landless farmers. Low-income producers have become successfully
involved in commercial farming activities through an intensive promotion and
assistance effort. In order to reduce the costs of such assistance, EMATER-MG
would intensify its use of the group approach, including audio-visual methods,
radio messages, and as appropriate printed leaflets. Its work would focus on
the farmer's family and community, which in many cases play decisive roles in
the farmer's acceptance of technological and social change. For this reason,
the number of social extensionists would be significantly increased in the
project area. After initial contact with small groups of about 15 farmers,
meeting of larger groups would be organized to provide information on topics
such as marketing, credit procedures, and community matters. These contacts
would be followed up by agricultural extension activities (including field
demonstrations of results and specific cultivation techniques and farmer
"field days") and by social extension activities (including demonstrations,
community courses and instruction weeks in areas related to nutrition, child
care, and home improvement). The extensionists would be backed up by subject
matter specialists in the regional offices. During the larger group meetings,
they would also be assisted by local bank agents and regional officers of
other participating agencies. Extensionists would cooperate closely with
SUDECOOP in the assistance of about 350 farmer groups (para 4.30).
4.19      To increase its effectiveness, EMATER-MG would concentrate its
efforts on about 400 (out of 622) communities. It would attempt to introduce
about 30,000 small farmers into the rural credit system and increase the



- 17 -
coverage of farm families by the social extension service from 2,400 to about
37,000. By the third year each extension officer would reach an additional
number of at least 50 farmers annually with supervised credit. The coverage
ratio would ultimately be about 250 farmers per agricultural extension officer
and about 400 families (or 4 communities) per social extension worker. To
reach this coverage, it is assumed that farmers would graduate within two or
three years into virtually direct bank clients, requiring only limited assis-
tance from the extension officers for credit applications. EMATER-MG would
continue to give these farmers technical assistance and farm management and
marketing information. During negotiations assurances were obtained from the
State Government that all of the new extension officers would be employed and
trained not later than June 30, 1982.
4.20      Research.  Agricultural research under the project would be speci-
fically oriented toward the needs of small farmers within the project area,
and would concentrate on the main crops 1/ and on livestock as part of mixed
farming systems. Farm management research initiated under the first project
would be continued. Provisions would be made for about 400 experiments and
demonstration plots annually, of which at least 50% would be at the farm level
with 20% on farms of less than 10 ha. The project would finance vehicles,
equipment, salaries of incremental staff and incremental operating expenses,
consultancies and the publication of results.
4.21      EPAMIG would be the executing agent for the project's research
activities. It would cooperate closely with the IEF in the initiation of
agro-forestry experiments designed to investigate the possibilities of reduc-
ing the unproductive period of reforestation for small farmers. The research
needed to improve on-farm storage would be executed in cooperation with the
University of Vicosa, which has valuable experience in this field. Marketing
research would be executed in collaboration with EMATER-MG, CAMIG and the
Project Coordination Unit. EPAMIG would annually prepare a detailed experi-
ment and demonstration program after consultation with EMATER-MG, which would
promote demonstration activities, divulge research results, and inform EPAMIG
of the acceptance of new techniques among project farmers. The annual research
program would be sent to the Bank for comment. Because of the importance of
obtaining results which could be applied in the project, assurances were
obtained at negotiations from the State that EPAMIG would annually publish the
results of its overall project research activities in one of its monthly
bulletins. Since research in the field of small farm management constitutes
an essential part of the program, the appointment of a full-time farm manage-
ment specialist to the project research staff would be a condition of disburse-
ment against expenses made under the research component.
4.22      Land Reclamation.  The project would assist about 1,800 small low
income farmers to establish the most appropriate system to reclaim and cultivate
6,000 ha of swampland (varzeas). Special efforts would be made to assure that
appropriate land use and drainage are maintained after sub-project completion.
The operational capacity of the land reclamation subsidiary of the executing
agent, RURALMINAS, would be strengthened. The project would operate in four
1/   Beans, maize, cotton, manioc, rice, banana, garlic and tomato.



- 18 -
concentration areas, one in each of the four project sub-areas. RURALMINAS
would execute the reconnaisance, land surveying, farm planning, and the actual
implementation of the individual subprojects, in full cooperation with EMATER-MG
agricultural extensionists. In order to better focus on target group farmers,
the areas selected for reclamation assistance would be where qmall farmers would
account for at least 30% (in the three sub-areas other than Zona da Mata) to
50% of the reclaimable land. To help RURALMINAS expand its capacity and
gradually develop into an agency able to work with small farmers in a commer-
cially viable way, the project would finance certain additional reclamation
equipment, initial costs and start-up supply of materials for the establishment
and operation of four regional offices, salaries of incremental technical
assistance and planning personnel and consultant services.
4.23      RURALMINAS has considerable practical experience in land reclamation,
but has not yet institutionalized many of its operating procedures. RURALMINAS
was also a pioneer in "varzeas" mechanization work, which temporarily over-
shadowed the necessity for preventive equipment maintenance and operational
efficiency. Also, a cost control system was only introduced recently.
During negotiations assurances were obtained from the State that consultants
would be employed not later than June 30, 1981 on terms and conditions accept-
able to the Bank to assist RURALMINAS in improving its cost accounting system,
in organizing a preventive equipment maintenance system, and in better structur-
ing operational procedures.
4.24      Due to the pioneering nature of initial RURALMINAS work in the
"varzeas", a variety of problems, such as the unexpected high costs of river
regulation, were experienced. As a result, the state was forced to assume
additional costs in many cases and has granted subsidies on an ad hoc basis
(e.g., not charging established rates to some clients). In addition, charges
to farmers for land reclamation services have been subsidized, since they are
based on machine-hour rates using over-optimistic parameters. It is estimated
that only about 65% of the costs (equipment replacement and machine operating
cost, but not including a proportional share of administration overhead) are
recovered through machine hour charges. Since the potential production
increases on reclaimed "varzeas" justify greater cost recovery, the subsidies
would be reduced gradually. During negotiations assurances were obtained from
the State that, not later than December 31, 1980 a system would be established
to eliminate unprogrammed subsidies and that, not later than June 30, 1983,
tariffs would be applied to recover full machinery operating costs, full
machinery replacement costs and reasonable administrative costs related
to on-farm development works. Assurances were also obtained from the State
that the equipment financed under the project would be used exclusively in
the project area during the project implementation period and that reports
and proposals from the consultants would be sent to the Bank for comment as
soon as they become available, but not later than January 1, 1982.
4.25      Reforestation.  The project would aim to develop wood and charcoal
production on small farms. About 10,000 ha on 4,100 farms would be reforested,
and 300 ha for agro-forestry experiments would be established by IEF in
cooperation with EPAMIG (para. 4.21). The project would provide technical
assistance to the beneficiaries and free seedlings, fertilizers, and insecti-
cides for the first two planting years. It would finance the establishment



- 19 -
of nine new nurseries, the production of seedlings on 21 nurseries, the
establishment of 13 local IEF forestry extension offices, and the salaries
of 15 new extensionists.
4.26      IEF gained considerable experience in small farm reforestation under
the first rural development project. Though small farmers have demonstrated
an initial reluctance to engage in reforestation activities because of the
seven-year gestation period, there is a growing interest in trees as a farm
crop. This is in part due to rapidly increasing prices of firewood, fence
posts and minor construction wood. The project credit component would be
available to help finance the farmers contribution, which would consist of
labor, the costs of necessary fencing, and possibly the installation of
charcoal ovens. The IEF would promote charcoal production on small farms with
more than 15 ha, since at least 5 ha of trees would be required to supply a
small stove adequately. During negotiations assurances were obtained from the
State that (a) provision of free inputs would be limited to 10 ha per farmer
in order to reach as many as possible; and (b) at least seven new nurseries
would be established not later than June 30, 1981.
4.27      Marketing.  The project would take the initial steps toward the
creation of a better integrated marketing system, offering more marketing
options to the small farmer, within the project area. Project actions would
be aimed at increasing the small farmer's bargaining power and allowing him
access to Government-sponsored minimum price acquisition and loan programs.
Project activities would include: (a) expansion of input sales activities of
CAMIG and agricultural cooperatives, and the construction of about 20 input
supply outlets; (b) construction of 20 to 25 new public storage facilities,
ranging in capacity from 300 to 3,000 tons; (c) establishment of a permanent
group to conduct market opportunity research; and (d) training courses for
both administrative and field-level personnel. The project would finance
construction costs; incremental salaries and operating costs associated with
carrying out studies and training, and coordination of component activities;
vehicles and equipment. Other project components would also reinforce the
marketing component. These include research and credit for improvements
in on-farm storage and extension activities to disseminate to small farmers
market price and quality information and to promote the adoption of new
marketing and storage technologies and institutional forms.
4.28      Project marketing activities would be carried out by several agencies:
CAMIG (input supply and storage operation); EPAMIG (research); EMATER (exten-
sion); SUDECOOP (extension in cooperatives); CASEMG (storage construction);
and the Federal University of Vicosa, UFV, (training). Details of the struc-
ture of the marketing component are given in Annex 4. Overall control would
be the responsibility of an already nominated marketing coordinator in the
project coordination unit. The State has formally constituted a State Market-
ing Commission, composed of the presidents of the involved institutions and
chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture. The commission would give overall
policy guidance to the State's marketing activities.
4.29      CAMIG would play a central role in project area marketing activities.
It would purchase and store production as an agent of the Government-sponsored
minimum price program. Since CAMIG has no previous experience in this field,
the project would make provisions for two full-time consultants to strengthen



- 20 -
CAMIG's organization and implementation capacity. In a complementary effort
to complete the information about current marketing problems and opportunities
for the area's small farmers, EPAMIG would undertake a survey during the first
project year. Project actions in subsequent years would be adjusted to take
into account the EPAMIG study and the consultants' findings. Satisfactory
terms of reference for the consultants and the work program for EPAMIG's
preliminary study have already been prepared. In addition, the State has
taken steps to assure an adequate seed supply to the project area, and the
curricula of the marketing training courses have already been designed.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the State that (a) the
results of EPAMIG's study and the program of CAMIG-proposed investments for
storage and input facilities would be forwarded to the Bank for review not
later than June 30, 1981; and (b) any public storage facility of 3,000 tons or
larger in the project area, as determined by the first-year study, would be
constructed with state resources. The employment of CAMIG counterparts for
the consultants will be a condition of disbursement for the component and
disbursements against expenses made for off-farm storage facilities, and farm
supply outlets would be contingent upon Bank approval of location and cons-
truction plans.
4.30      Assistance to Cooperative Societies.  The project would focus on
the promotion of farmer groups at the community level, and assist these
groups to evolve into cooperative societies and assist the cooperatives in
improving their operating effectiveness and member service. The project
would aim to increase cooperative membership from 2,400 to 6,000 and to reach
a total of 9,000 farm rs in farmer groups. Some 350 farmer groups would be
formed and 120 pre-cooperatives would be assisted. Technical assistance would
be made available to seven existing cooperatives, and about eight new ones
would be constituted and assisted. SUDECOOP would be the executing agency,
in cooperation with EMATER-MG. The project would finance the equipping of
three SUDECOOP regional offices; incremental salaries and operating costs of
SUDECOOP; cars; salaries of selected managerial and technical staff to be
placed in cooperatives; and training programs for cooperative members and
officials, farmers and technicians of other executing agencies.
4.31      Currently, there are only six agricultural and one artisan coopera-
tive in the project area, with an average membership of 400. Active member-
ship is low and the annual turnover of inputs distributed through the coop-
eratives is only about US$40 per member. Among the criteria to be used to
determine a cooperative's eligibility for managerial assistance would be
specific potential to profit from the assistance; and the existence of a
cooperative management open to operational innovation. The assistance to a
specific cooperative would continue beyond one year only if the active member-
ship would be at least 200, with about 50% being small or landless farmers.
The costs of new managerial and technical staff placed in the cooperatives
would be financed by the project on a decreasing basis, starting with 100%
during the first year and thereafter decreasing annually by 20%. Assistance
would be given only after the conclusion of a contract between the cooperative
and SUDECOOP regulating staffing, administrative and auditing requirements.
SUDECOOP would annually evaluate the performance of each assisted cooperative
in order to determine whether continued assistance would be justified.



- 21 -
Small Non-Farm Enterprises
4.32      Technical Assistance.  The component, to be executed by SETAS, would
aim to improve the productivity and revenues of non-regi3tered small non-farm
enterprises. It would: (a) provide managerial and technical training (exten-
sion) to 1,100 non-registered small enterprises, 530 artisans, and 500 indivi-
duals who intend to start small enterprises; (b) assist about 950 enterprises
in obtaining credit from existing non-project credit lines, for investment and
working capital; (c) strengthen the organization of SETAS, establish eight
technical assistance centers, covering 38 municipalities, and train 15 field
assistants; and (d) provide for the study of improved technology and marketing
opportunities. The project would finance salaries of incremental supervisory
staff, field assistants, and teachers for the training courses; incremental
operating costs, equipment and cars; and consultant studies and provisions to
implement their recommendations.
4.33      There is currently no public assistance to the non-registered small
enterprises, which produce a wide variety of goods and services, mostly for
local low-income markets. The technical assistance services to be set up by
SETAS under the project would be complementary to and collaborate with the
existing service for registered enterprises, which is administered by CEAG-MG.
The field assistants would concentrate on the improvement of technical skills
and product quality in order to enhance market opportunities and respond to an
increased local demand which would result from other project activities.
During the first three years, about 100 training classes would be taught by
the best local subject specialists who would receive previous training from
SETAS. Tools and equipment for the classes would be provided by a mobile unit
financed under the project. SETAS would contract the State Technological
Center Foundation of Minas Gerais (CETEC) to provide information about effi-
cient production techniques and to conduct applied research in the project
area. Extensionists would coordinate these activities and stimulate, in
cooperation with SUDECOOP, entrepreneurs to form associations for more effi-
cient input purchasing and product marketing. The component market studies
would be reinforced by a small investment fund of US$300,000, to provide
financial assistance for marketing efforts in line with the studies' recom-
mendations. During negotiations assurances were obtained from the State that
terms of reference for such studies would be satisfactory to the Bank, and
that the study results would be presented to the Bank when available, but not
later than June 30, 1982. Assurances were also obtained that the State would
provide the Bank with satisfactory detailed terms and conditions for the use
of the marketing investment fund prior to its use, and that the State would
ensure the availability of the credit expected to be needed by some 950 small
enterprises (amounting to about US$2 million).
Physical Infrastructure
4.34      Feeder Roads.  The project would aim to improve year round accessi-
bility to and from project communities with agricultural development potential.
It would include: (a) the design and construction of improvements of about
3,360 km of municipal roads to appropriate all weather standards; (b) the
design and construction of about 100 km of new access roads to currently
isolated communities; (c) the development and equipping of a municipal road



- 22 -
maintenance program and (d) the training of personnel for maintenance of
essential roads to support the rural development program in the project area.
Consultants would be contracted for the preparation of engineering designs and
contract documents for road improvements and construction; supervision of
construction; the preparation of a municipal road maintenance nrogram; and
assistance in training. Project financed equipment would include about 300
units of maintenance equipment procured internationally, as well as an alloca-
tion (equivalent to 20% of equipment costs) for required hand tools and spare
parts. About 100 units of equipment would be used initially for force account
construction and road improvement on up to 20% of total road works, where
contracting would be impractical. DER-MG would be the executing agent of the
feeder road component.
4.35      The lack of adequate access is a major constraint to accelerated
development in the municipalities of the project area. The existing municipal
road network generally consists of dry weather tracks which are poorly
maintained due to the lack of funds and equipment, proper work planning and
personnel training. Under the project, DER-MG would annually select, in
collaboration with EMATER-MG, the priority feeder roads which would best
support other development efforts. The roads would be improved or constructed
to one of the two design classes given in Annex 5. The roads for the first
project year have already been selected. Except where the nature or scale of
road activities justify work by force account, road works would be awarded
through local competitive bidding procedures. During negotiations assurances
were obtained from the State that the length of roads improved under force
account would not exceed 20% of the total length of feeder roads included in
the project. Also, the State gave assurances that before initiating road
construction work, DER-MG would conclude a contract with each municipality,
establishing their respective obligations in maintaining the constructed roads
adequately. Assurances were also obtained from the State that it would
improve to BNDE class E standard, by June 30, 1983, an additional 486 km of
feeder roads, listed in Annex 5, complementary to the project, to link-up
municipalities in the project area to the state and federal highway network.
These works could be financed under the Bank's lines of credit through BNDE
for financing feeder roads subprojects (loans 1207 BR and 1730 BR).
4.36      DER-MG would acquire the services of consultants to prepare a road
maintenance program for essential municipal roads in the project area and to
make proposals for the execution of this program, including a financing plan.
Such roads would be determined by the consultants out of the total municipal
road network of about 20,000 km. To assist the municipalities in implementing
this program, DER-MG would, under the project, train foremen in organization
and execution of road maintenance work and personnel in use and maintenance of
equipment. During negotiations assurances were obtained from the State to
prepare the draft program by June 30, 1981, and to make complementary funds
available at the beginning of each quarter from January 1, 1982, to guarantee
proper maintenance of these roads, in case allocated municipal and federal
highway funds would not suffice. DER-MG or the municipalities would provide
operators and assistants for the equipment and workshop back-up services
according to the consultant's studies. During negotiations assurances were
also obtained from the State that the equipment, tools and spare parts
procured under the project would until project completion be used only for



- 23 -
maintaining municipal roads in the project area. Separate procedures would
be maintained to account for handtools and spare parts purchased under the
project. To participate in the maintenance program and to receive additional
funding from the State, each municipality would enter into an annual agreement
with DER-MG for carrying out the maintenance according to the agreed program.
The feeder road component would be coordinated by a DER-MG engineer, who has
already been nominated, and four teams in the project area, each staffed with
six officers who would accompany all aspects of the project as counterparts.
The employment or assignment of the four teams of six officers of DER-MG
counterparts would be a condition of disbursement for the feeder road component.
4.37      Telephone Communication.  This component of the project would
install one public pay phone in each of 34 municipal centers where no communi-
cation now exists with the rest of the State. The locations are isolated
except for messenger service, and the nearest telephone is frequently up to
200 km away. A minimum telephone service is a prerequisite to the efficient
administration of such project components as extension and health services and
would help to improve living conditions in the area. DAE would be the execu-
ting agent. The proposed telephone units would be the least cost solution and
would consist of a telephone connected by a microwave link to the state-owned
telephone network (TELEMIG). The instrument would initially be operated by
the municipality and would be available to the public. The rate charged per
call would be in accordance with the authorized national telephone tariffs
plus a small surcharge to cover local operating costs. The minimum installa-
tion would gradually help to develop communications within the area and would
later be suitable for extension to provide local service. When fully oper-
ational, it would be transferred to TELEMIG for maintenance and operation.
Social Services
4.38      Education.  The project would improve primary and secondary educa-
tional facilities and services throughout the project area. It would include:
(a) development and application of a revised primary school curriculum; (b) the
training of educational and supervisory personnel; (c) construction materials
and equipment for school canteens, to be constructed by the communities;
(d) training courses for the operation of school canteens and equipment for
school gardens; (e) improvement of one primary and four secondary agricultural
schools located outside the project area, but serving the project municipali-
ties, including curriculum reform, additional construction, and equipment; and
(f) strengthening of project administration. The construction of additional
primary and supplementary school facilities would be part of the construction
of community centers (para. 4.43). SEE would be the executing agent. The
project would finance salaries of incremental SEE support staff and the
incremental operating expenses, including materials, equipment, and vehicles,
to adequately supervise project activities.
4.39      All project activities would be integrated and applied to one
selected school per project municipality, with the intention that the model
could then be applied to other schools. The SEE would aim to improve the
quality of education services by curriculum reform, based upon studies of
cultural and language patterns and upon experience gained under other rural
development projects in Brazil. In addition, all teachers would be trained;



- 24 -
school meals and nutrition and health education would be provided; and the
school calendar would be adapted to local needs. The curriculum reform and
the improvement of the agricultural school would allow the schools to serve
as meeting and information centers for small farmers in the area, mainly by
giving more emphasis to small farm problems. During negotiations assurances
were obtained from the State that it would provide to the Bank, for comment,
the result of the curriculum studies when available; that the new curriculum
would be implemented before February 1, 1982; and that the State would finance
the expenses associated with the provision of school meals in the project
schools.
4.40      Health and Sanitation.  The project would improve the quality of
primary health services and conditions, by (a) strengthening the central and
regional health administration; (b) training or retraining some 1,000 health
attendants and 500 supervisory personnel; (c) constructing or improving about
200 health centers or health posts; (d) equipping about 90 health posts;
(e) constructing 85 simple water supply systems, reaching about 25,000 families;
(f) constructing and placing 8,000 sanitary installations; (g) carrying out a
Chagas-disease control experiment for about 3,100 houses in two municipalities;
and (h) establishing a program for detection of Schistosomiasis-infested
snails in varzeas to be reclaimed under the project. The executing agent
would be SES. The project would finance construction costs, equipment, cars,
materials, salaries of about 200 new health attendants during 18 months,
salaries of incremental SES supervisory staff, and training and retraining
costs.
4.41      The experieace of the Zona da Mata project shows that the results of
primary health care depend largely on the quality of the attendants, the support
from SES, and the extent of community participation. The project would focus
on the training of personnel and the strengthening of SES' organisation, by
standardizing its supervision systems, structuring its information system, and
improving the medical supply system for health posts. During negotiations
assurances were obtained from the State that SES would appoint and maintain
sufficient personnel to execute the project and adequately staff the health
posts and centers, and that the final plans to strengthen the central and
regional health administration of SES will be presented to the Bank by
December 31, 1980. Community participation would be sought by constructing
and remodeling health posts and centers with local contractors or with com-
munity assistance. Construction would be initiated only after conclusion of a
contract between the SES and the municipality, regulating maintenance respon-
sibilities.
4.42      Since infectious diseases controllable through sanitation measures
account for about 45% of recorded deaths, sanitation and water supply activi-
ties contribute an essential complement to the health services. In collabora-
tion with EMATER-MG, SEE, and SETAS, health and sanitation education would be
provided. In addition, SES would supervise the construction of simple, mainly
standpipe, water supply systems. The source of water would be mostly from
wells with safe groundwater. The quality of water would be controlled and
filtration would be installed as necessary. These systems would each serve
between 100 and 500 families, at an average cost of about US$90 per family.
Before -onstruction of a water supply system, SES would conclude, with the
municipality or DAE, as the case may be, a contract in which one of the latter



- 25 -
would assume the obligation to operate and maintain the system and to charge
appropriate user-rates. In the case of house connections, this rate should
cover operation and maintenance costs, and in the case of a standpipe system,
a symbolic monthly rate would be collected through community associations.
During negotiations assurances were obtained from the State that the detailed
plans for any proposed water supply system with costs exceeding US$120/family
would be provided to the Bank for approval prior to construction, and that
adequate arrangements for the efficient operation and maintenance of all
systems would be made prior to their construction.
4.43      Community Centers.  The proposed project would establish community
centers in 32 municipalities equally distributed over the project area. The
project would locate the centers in communities in need of improved physical
infrastructure with the objective to reduce construction costs and integrating
project activities. The selection of specific communities would be made on
criteria outlined in Annex 6. The project would finance the costs of infra-
structure for the building site, the construction of the basic core of the
center (school rooms, health post, community meeting room and kitchen), and
the basic equipment for school rooms and health posts. Since the construction
and operation of the centers would involve the participation of the community
and several agencies, the construction would be executed under the aegis of
the Project Coordination Unit, whereafter SETAS would take over the control of
administration.
4.44      The type of community center to be built would be tailored to the
needs of the community, and its final design would be chosen with community
participation. To ensure this participation, the PCU would involve the
community council and would organize meetings with community families.
The costs of this preparatory work are included in the project management
costs (para 4.47). It is expected that four types of centers would be built,
depending on the number of families in the community. They would vary mainly
in the number of classrooms, ranging from two to seven. The layout and size
of the building site would be conducive to future extensions of the centers,
although these extensions would not be financed under the project and would be
built with the communities' own effort and initiative. Experience in the Zona
da Mata has shown that the impact of a community center depends largely on the
proper set-up of the center's administration, with the roles and responsibili-
ties of the various participating agencies clearly spelled out. An acceptable
administration scheme for community centers has been prepared by the State.
During negotiations assurances were obtained from the State that construction
of the centers would be completed before December 31, 1983, to ensure a signif-
icant impact on the development of the project area. Assurances were also
obtained that the final engineering designs and cost estimates for models of
the four types of community centers would be presented to the Bank for review
no later than March 31, 1981 and that 2the construction plans of community
centers with costs exceeding US$150/m would be presented to the Bank for
approval. Disbursement against construction expenses made for the community
centers would be contingent upon satisfactory evidence of the acquisition of
land and right of way for the building sites of these respective centers.



- 26 -
4.45      Community Development.  The project would finance a community
development pilot project in 21 municipalities selected according to criteria
set forth in Annex 6. The principal objective of the pilot project would be
to stimulate community activities and activate community capabilities for
self-help. SETAS would be the executing agency and would operate in close
cooperation with the social extensionists of EMATER-MG. The project would
finance consultant services; incremental salaries and operating costs of
SETAS; cars and a fund to finance community sub-projects stimulated through
community initiatives and development efforts.
4.46      Numerous institutions and social action groups are involved in
community programs, and project personnel would aim to coordinate these
activities. In order to assist the communities, SETAS would establish and
administer a Community Development Fund, to finance small sub-projects, which
could not be financed by either provisions of the proposed project or by other
existing institutions or programs. The resources of the fund would be used
according to criteria listed in Annex 6, and funds would be disbursed only
after conclusion of a contract between SETAS and the community describing the
project, its costs and disbursements. During negotiations assurances were
obtained from the State that after two years or disbursement of US$300,000,
whichever comes first, SETAS would evaluate, in consultation with the Bank,
the impact of project actions on community development before continuing fund
disbursements.
4.47      Project Management.  The Secretariat of Agriculture (SEA) would be
the central coordinating agent of the project. The SEA would maintain a
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to administer the Project. It would operate
from a headquarter office in Belo Horizonte and four regional offices (para
6.03). The PCU would be in charge of the day-to-day operations (para 6.03)
and monitoring of project activities (para 6.06). The evaluation of the
project would be carried out by an independent entity, UFV (para 6.07). The
project would finance: (a) vehicles and equipment for the PCU's offices;
(b) staff salaries and travel expenses; (c) staff training and consultancies;
and (d) other incremental operating costs of project management, monitoring
and evaluation.
4.48      The PCU's staff would comprise about nine staff officers, including
a special coordinator for monitoring and one for marketing, an accountant in
charge of financial control, and an engineer in charge of generally super-
vising the construction of the various civil works executed under the project.
The regional coordination offices would be staffed by three officers each.
The project director and the four regional coordinators have already been
appointed. The project would finance the services of a consultant, who would
advise the project director on matters of cost accounting. Evaluation activi-
ties would consist of the execution of baseline studies, continuous evalua-
tions of major project trends, and an ex-post evaluation of project impact.

V. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Project Cost
5.01      The total project cost for the 5 year project implementation period
(July 1980 - June 1985) is estimated at US$184.6 million. This figure includes
US$5.2 million of taxes, US$9.0 million of physical contingencies 1/ and of
US$41.9 million price contingencies. 2/ The baseline costs were calculated
in January 1980 prices in Cr$, at an exchange rate of US$1 = Cr$42.33. The
foreign exchange component was estimated at 17.6%, or US$32.5 million. The
project costs are summarized overleaf and annual phasing is given in Annex 7,
Table 1.
1/   Physical contingencies were estimated in relationship with the degree
of preparation of the different project components and constitute on the
average 6.2% of the baseline costs. Details per component are given in
Annex 7, Table 1.
2/   The price contingencies were calculated over the baseline US dollar
costs plus physical contingencies according to the following percentages:
10.5% for 1980, 9% for 1981, 8% for 1982, and 7% thereafter.

- 29 -
Financing
5.02      The proposed Bank loan of US$63 million to the State of Minas Gerais
would finance the US$32.5 million foreign exchange component plus US$30.5 million
of local cost. In total the Bank loan will finance 35% of total project cost
net of taxes (34% of project costs). The loan will be for a 15 year period
including 3 years of grace. To help finance its share of total project costs,
the State of Minas Gerais intends to secure by June 30, 1981 about US$50
million from one or more external banks under co-financing arrangements. The
usual co-financing links for the commercial bank financing with the proposed
Bank loan would be provided. The amount and timing of the proposed co-
financing would be reviewed with the Bank, taking into consideration the
amount of counterpart funding required from the project, other external and
internal resources available to the State, and market conditions.
5.03      The direct and inputed foreign exchange component of the project
is relatively low (17.6%). The high commitment of State Government to the
project and the opportunity to extend to other areas and regions of the state
the experience gained in the past project make appropriate the Bank-financed
support for more than the foreign exchange component equivalent. It seems
reasonable that the Bank contribute in financing 34% of total project cost
for the project to succeed in mobilizing additional Brazilian resources and
to maintain a continuous commitment to the project. In addition to total
project costs eligible for Bank financing (US$184.6 million), the State and
Federal Government would finance incremental short-term seasonal credit of
about US$15.7 million and execute and finance essential complementary activities
(such as secondary roads, electrification trunklines, credit to small enter-
prises, teachers' salaries, etc.) at a cost of US$33.9 million. The costs of
the total program would be US$242.6 million of which the State and Federal
Government would contribute US$171.2 million or 70.5% of total program costs,
the Bank US$63.0 million (26%) and the farmers US$8.4 million (3.5%). Details
of the program costs are given in Annex 7, Table 2. The flow of information
and project funding is given in Annex 8. During negotiations assurances were
obtained from the State and Federal Government that adequate counterpart
funding would be available for the timely execution of the project, and
adequate operation and maintenance of facilities and services developed under
the project. Assurances were also obtained from the State that it would
assure timely acquisition of any additional land or right of way for project
works.
Procurement
5.04      Farm inputs and investment items would be procured by individual
farmers through local trade channels. Equipment and vehicles for improvement
and maintenance by force account of feeder roads (para 4.34) and land reclama-
tion (para 4.22) would be procured by international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Such items would amount to about US$8.8
million without contingencies. Vehicles, tractors and other equipment required
by the various executing agencies over the implementation period are locally
produced and readily available. Such items (about US$1.0 million) would be
procured in accordance with local procurement and competitive bidding proce-
dures, which are acceptable. Construction works for feeder road improvement



- 30 -
and construction (about US$16 million) would be planned annually on the basis
of previous field surveys, establishing the quantity and quality of works
required, and divided in construction lots per municipality. The Bank would
review the construction standards, bidding and contract documents before the
first round of bidding. Contracts for the works for feeder rcads and for
civil works required for community centers, health centers, health posts,
storage facilities and retail stores (all items totalling about US$17.6
million) would be awarded to pre-qualified bidders on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally and in accordance with procedures which are satis-
factory. Brazil has a competitive local construction industry capable of
carrying out the project works. Since individual construction works would be
of minor size and quite dispersed, foreign contractors are not expected to be
interested, though they would not be excluded. Water supply and sanitation
works (US$2.3 million), the equipment for Chagas control (US$0.8 million),
telephone-communication (US$1.2 million) and 20% of the length of feeder road
improvement in areas where contract works would not be practical (US$3.2
million) would be constructed under force account. Project financing for
rural electrification (US$16.4 million) would be in the form of numerous small
credits to individual farmers, who would purchase their connections from CEMIG
or DAE, which would install the connections under force account. Consultancy
services (totalling US$4.8 million) would include about 100 man-years (at an
average of US$3,800/ month). It is expected that the majority of consultant
services could be found in Brazil, but expatriates would not be excluded.
About 85% of consultancy work would go to the feeder road component, about 5%
to marketing improvement, and 10% to management services.
Disbursement
5.05      The proposed loan, which would finance 35% of the total project
cost eligible for Bank financing, would be disbursed at the rate of 34% of
project expenditures for each component. Disbursements would (as in the case
of Loan 1362-BR) be made through the Ministry of Finance in Brasilia and the
State Secretariat of Finance in Belo Horizonte to the project coordinating
fiscal agency SEPLAN, against withdrawal applications covering statements of
expenditures, initiated by the various executing agencies under the project
and certified by the PCU in the Secretariat of Agriculture. Statements of
expenditure would be audited as indicated in paragraph 6.08. Supporting
documentation for credit, salaries, administrative expenses and construction
under force account would not be submitted to the Bank, but would be retained
by the PCU and made available for inspection by the Bank during project
supervision missions. Details of documentation to be submitted to the Bank
for civil works, vehicles, equipment, and consultancies have been reviewed
during negotiations. A description of disbursement procedures against state-
ment of expenses is given in Annex 9. Such procedures have been satisfactorily
applied under the First Rural Development project and enabled the determina-
tion of incremental costs. The estimated disbursement schedule is given in
Annex 10. To ensure a timely project implementation and to enable the full
inclusion of the agricultural season (starting in June) during the first year
of project implementation, the project would reimburse not more than US$500,000
against project expenses made before the date of loan signing, but after
April 1, 1980. Such expenses would mainly include startup costs, costs for
initial studies and hiring of key personnel.

VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Organization and Management
6.01      The State of Minas Gerais has already created a project management
council (conselho diretor) consisting of the Secretaries of Planning, Finance,
Agriculture, Health, Education, and Labor, Social Action and Sports. During
project implementation, this council would convene regularly to maintain and
refine overall project strategy, evaluate results, and approve annual working
plans and budgets. The Secretary of Planning of the State of Minas Gerais
(SEPLAN) would act as overall coordinator and council president, while the
Secretariat of Agriculture would be in charge of the day to day coordination
of the activities of the participating agencies. To carry out this task, the
Secretariat of Agriculture is creating a Project Coordination Unit (PCU),
headed by a Project Director responding directly to the Secretary. The
Project Director would be assisted by four regional coordinators, who would
ensure adequate coordination and integration of project activities at the
regional, local and community levels. The participating agencies would each
appoint a full time project manager. These managers would meet with the
Project Director and project technicians periodically as the Consultative
Technical Group, to discuss implementation progress and monitoring results and
make appropriate recommendations to the Secretary of Planning. An organiza-
tional chart of project administration is presented in Annex 11 and a list of
executing agencies in Annex 3. A summary of the training efforts planned
under the various project components, to assure timely and efficient project
implementation, is given in Annex 7, Table 3.
Project Coordination Unit
6.02      The PCU would have a central office in Belo Horizonte.  Regional
offices would be located in Rio Pardo de Minas, Diamantina, Muriae and Formiga
(see Maps IBRD 14954 and 14694). The central office would be responsible
for the administration of the project at the State level. To carry out this
task, the Project Director would be assisted by: (a) a monitoring and tech-
nical assistance unit, consisting of one coordinator and staff officers;
(b) an administrative unit, consisting of one accountant and one assistant;
(c) a marketing coordination unit, consisting of one coordinator and one
technician; (d) a civil works engineer; and (e) an adequate administrative
support staff. Each regional office would consist of a regional coordinator,
one credit/production coordinator and one social coordinator and support
staff. Due to the vast distances and specific characteristics of each region,
an internal information and control system would be organized by the Project
Director to facilitate the necessary delegation of authority. The regional
coordinator would also be responsible for organizing local and community level
project coordination. This would include meetings of municipal consultative
groups and community associations and promotion of an efficient information
flow among the participating agencies. During negotiations assurances were
obtained from the State that it would maintain an adequate and qualified staff
in the PCU and its regional offices, and that the Bank would be consulted
should the Project Director have to be replaced.



- 32 -
Operating Agreements and Procedures
6.03      Because the project requires effective inter-institutional integra-
tion, the State Government, through SEPLAN, would enter into an overall
agreement (convenio) with the SEA. This convenio would specify the project's
administrative structure and SEA's responsibilities 'end obligations as the
project's coordinating agent. Subsequently, SEPLAN and SEA would enter into
tripartite convenios with each executing agency, outlining each agency's
obligations in project execution, project targets, and the funding and imple-
mentation schedules (Annex 12). In addition, with the assistance of the PCU,
convenios would be concluded between the executing agencies and collaborating
agencies (Annex 2). Finally, prior to the construction of civil works, the
executing agencies would conclude agreements with the involved municipalities
and communities to ensure their proper operation and adequate maintenance.
Draft convenios involving the executing agencies and samples of agreements
between such agencies and local entities have been reviewed and found satis-
factory. During negotiations assurances were obtained from State Government
that it would enter into and maintain all such convenios and agreements
throughout the project implementation period. Receipt by the Bank of satis-
factory signed convenios with the executing agency for a given component
would be a condition of disbursement for that component.
6.04      Since the project covers a broad range of activites under diverse
circumstances, the timing and scope of activities would undoubtedly require
adjustments during project implementation. During the month of August, each
executing agency wou'd prepare an annual plan, detailing the activities and
expected expenditure. for the following calendar year. These plans would be
discussed in the Consultative Technical Group, reviewed by the PCU, and
presented to the Project Management Council for its review and approval. The
project's working plan and budget would be presented before September 30 to
the State Government to secure adequate funding in the State Budget. During
negotiations assurances were obtained from the State that the annual budget
proposal would be made available to the Bank by October 31 each year for
comments.
6.05      Since there is an overlap in time and space between the first rural
development project (Zona da Mata) and the proposed project which includes
part of the same region, the State would ensure that the obligations and
responsibilities of project personnel within the participating institutions
and the two coordinating agents (RURALMINAS for the first project and SEA
for the proposed second project) were clearly defined. The participating
institutions would maintain their full support of the first project scheduled
for completion by December 31, 1981. Disbursements for each of the proposed
component activities in the Zona da Mata region would be contingent upon the
satisfactory completion of the corresponding activity under the first project.
The State has also confirmed in a written statement to the Bank that after
completion of the first project, a sufficient number of qualified personnel
would be maintained in the local offices of the participating institutions in
the Zona da Mata to consolidate the progress made under the project.

Prolect Monitoring
6.06      Project monitoring would be executed by the PCU through the project
monitoring and technical assistance unit. The basic inTormation for monitor-
ing would be provided by the executing agencies, mainly through their own
supervising and accounting departments. To ensure timely data collection, the
PCU would work out with the executing agencies standard information procedures,
compatible with the existing administrative systems prevailing in the institu-
tions. The PCU would prepare quarterly monitoring reports, giving details
of project implementation progress and expenses. They would point out achieve-
ments as well as shortfalls in project execution, costs relative to expecta-
tions, and in general comparisons of actual performance with targets, estimated
costs and itemized indicators (Annex 13). The monitoring reports would be
distributed to the members of the Project Management Council, the executing
agencies, the project component managers, and the regional coordinators. The
PCU would see to it that relevant information reports would be received by
the local officers of all participating institutions. The PCU would work
closely with the project evaluation team to establish key indicators and
select monitoring data, in order to ensure that the evaluation team would have
adequate information to perform its task. The PCU's monitoring unit would
also be responsible for the preparation of a Project Completion Report. During
negotiations assurances were obtained from the State that the monitoring
reports would be made available to the Bank quarterly and that the Completion
Report would be prepared and submitted to the Bank within six months after
project completion.
Project Evaluation
6.07      To complement monitoring activities, which are intended as a manage-
ment tool, project evaluation would aim to provide the State with the necessary
information to adjust, when appropriate, project strategy and rural development
policies. Evaluation activities would attempt to formulate and measure the
impact of the project on the development of the project area. Evaluation
will be contracted to the University of Vicosa (UFV), which has considerable
experience in evaluation work for other Bank projects. Due to the size of
the project area, the UFV would involve other institutions (outside of the
executing agencies) in the evaluation work, such as the Agricultural school
in Lavras. A qualified full-time agricultural economist, already nominated,
will head the evaluation team as overall evaluation coordinator. The evalua-
tion would consist of baseline studies, the preparation of annual evaluation
reports, and a post-project evaluation. The pre-project situation would be
established by baseline studies concerning the present health and educational
situation and the actual income and employment levels. These studies would
cover the total population of the project area, giving special emphasis to the
target group. Annual reports, would call to the attention of the Project
Management Council existing development trends in the project area and would
contain appropriate recommendations. The evaluation exercise would attempt to
anticipate future developments and to assist the State to respond adequately
to upcoming demands. The post-project evaluation would assess the final
project impact, and it would assist the PCU in preparing its Completion
Report. During negotiations assurances were obtained from the State that:
(a) the baseline studies would be completed before January 31, 1981; and
(b) annual reports would be presented to the Bank not later than December 31
of each year and that the ex-post evaluation would be submitted to the Bank
within six months after project completion.

Accounts and Auditing
6.08      All participating agencies have an internal auditing system and
also are externally audited by the General Auditor of the State and the Govern-
ment Auditors of the Ministry of Finance. Both the BB and the State banks are
audited by the Central Bank's auditing unit. Each of the participating agen-
cies, including the PCU, would maintain separate project accounts of project
expenditures, including expenditures for key complementary activities financed
by the State (para 5.03). The PCU would consolidate project accounts, which
would be audited by an auditor satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations
assurances were obtained from the State that: (a) copies of the audited
statements of project accounts of the various participating agencies, the
banks, and the PCU would be kept at the PCU and made available for Bank super-
vision; (b) copies of the auditing report of the project auditor would be made
available to the Bank within six months of the end of the State's fiscal year;
and (c) such audit reports would include a separate opinion as to whether the
procedures and controls related to the use of statement of expenditures were
in accordance with the legal project requirements and accurately prepared.
VII. PRODUCTION, DEMAND, MARKETING AND PRICES
Farm Production
7.01      The proposed project would be built upon relatively simple, low risk
agronomic practices (Annex 14). Farmers cultivating less than 10 ha would
mainly improve the production of subsistence crops. Farmers cultivating over
10 ha would also increase subsistence crop production, but would be more market-
oriented. Incremental production would be brought about by increasing the
planted area and land and labor productivity through better agricultural and
managerial practices, supported by intensification of extension and research
services and an improved marketing system. Details of expected productivity
and production increases are given overleaf. Estimated at January 1980
farmgate prices, the annual incremental value of crop production at full
development is expected to amount to US$16.7 million; livestock production, to
US$10.4 million; and forestry production, to US$2.7 million; or a total of
US$29.8 million.
7.02      The basic crops would continue to be the traditional crops:  maize,
beans, rice, manioc and cotton. However, a relatively small number of farmers
would experiment with commercial crops such as fruits and vegetables that
could produce cash income for lower-income producers. They would receive
close technical support in improving cultivation techniques and production
systems adapted to the needs of the small farmer, while testing the market
implications of production increases. Projected crop yield increases asso-
ciated with the project are relatively modest and would be, on the average,
less than 50% over a period of five to ten years. In most cases, projected
yields would be less than those already obtained by the most progressive
farmers in the project area. The productivity in livestock production has
also been conservatively estimated, and the increase by full development would
average 33%.

Demand
7.03      The project area is situated favorably in relation to Brazil's major
urban centers -- Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Brasilia. Belo Horizonte
and 11 medium sized cities within the state would also constitute important
demand centers for the project's principal products. Incremental project
production would account for a small percentage of this total potential
demand. Therefore, supply constraints, i.e., inadequate marketing and storage
facilities, which the project would attempt to correct (para 4.29), would
be more likely to affect project production than would demand constraints. In
addition, it is expected that much of the project's incremental food production
would be consumed locally, partially as human and animal consumption in the
project area and partially in the adjacent areas. In some cases, incremental
production would be utilized to lessen expected deficits. This would depend,
however, on the efficiency of inter-regional marketing mechanisms. Most
production surpluses would occur in the southern portion of the area, while
most consumption deficits would be found in the northern areas. The table
below illustrates project area production/human consumption balances of key
project food products. Existing and expected surpluses and deficits would be
leveled by internal trade with adjacent areas (see also para 7.09).

7.04      Basic Grains and Traditional Foodcrops.  All of the project's manioc
production would be readily marketable within the project area, since expected
consumption would be greater than total project area production. The expected
expansion in project area animal production would absorb much of the substan-
tial maize surplus. The smaller surpluses in beans, rice, potato and possibly
maize, would either be channelled to adjoining localities by private traders
or bought by CAMIG and the CFP as part of the government minimum price program.



- 37 -
7.05      Fruits and Vegetables.  Most of the project's surplus production
would take place in the south of the project area. It is expected that the
fruits and vegetables produced would mainly be used to satisfy demand in the
rest of the project area and in the urban centers of Belo Horizonte and Sao
Paulo. The marketing study during the first year would assess the adequacy
of existing marketing channels and recommend future improvements (paras 4.29
and 7.02).
7.06      Dairy and Meat Products.  The surplus milk production would be
channelled through existing cooperatives to meet urban demand, chiefly in
Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Sao Paulo. Project milk, pork and beef
production would also upgrade rural diets and help meet expected urban demand
in the project area and adjoining cities.
7.07      Cotton and Wood Products.  The project's cotton production would
be utilized by local industries and Sao Paulo textile mills and would be
marketed easily. There is a wood shortage throughout the project area,
and the incremental production would be sold locally. Charcoal would mainly
be used to meet on farm needs, with the surpluses sold locally to the steel
plants through intermediaries.
Marketing and Prices
7.08      Project actions are designed to improve the small farmer's bargain-
ing position in the marketing of his products, enabling him to improve his
share of the final demand price. Improvements in the road system (para
4.34), banking facilities (para 4.12), cooperative marketing capabilities
(para 4.28), agricultural extension (para 4.17), marketing information and
storage facilities (para 4.29), would increase the small farmer's marketing
opportunities and decrease his vulnerability to seasonal price fluctuations.
Currently, there is little direct public involvement in marketing activities
within the project area. This involvement would be increased, where neces-
sary, to ensure a competitive climate and adequate marketing outlets for the
principal crops produced by the project's small farmers. To provide small
farmers with access to the government minimum price acquisition and loan
program for basic grains, CAMIG has been designated as an official purchasing
agent for that program. The project would assist CAMIG to perform this task
(para 4.29). Cooperatives, particularly in the south, have proven to be
effective in the assembly and marketing of milk and other dairy products and
would be expected to absorb the project's incremental production. As the
project progresses, and after the year-one marketing study, the market oppor-
tunity research group would continue to monitor the marketing arrangements
within the project area. The extension service would channel necessary
information to the small farmer (Annex 4).
7.09      The project's incremental production is not expected to modify the
existing final demand price structure. However, improvements in marketing and
storage capabilities are expected to diminish seasonal price variations and
increase the competitive climate in the project area, augmenting the farmer's
share of the final demand price. Currently, for basic grains, the farmer's
share of retail price varies from about 45% to 70%. For fruits and vegetables,



- 38 -
this percentage is lower, ranging from about 30% to 50%. With the improved
marketing arrangements, it is expected that the upper ranges of these percent-
ages would apply to the small farmer.
Non-Farm Enterprise Production, Demand and Marketing
7.10      The non-farm enterprises would engage mainly in production activities
utilizing food products, natural and synthetic fibers, wood and bamboo, leather,
clay and non-metalic minerals, and metals. A small number also engage in
repair work, other services, and small-scale commercial activities. About 75%
of production is sold within the project area, mainly to the lower and middle
income strata. For producers of "artistic" products, a great portion of the
market is in Belo Horizonte, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Two recent
surveys indicate that small enterprise sales could be significantly increased
with adequate credit, technical and marketing support. Sales impediments
consist of: (i) product quality problems, which shut many producers out of
lucrative urban markets; (ii) low production efficiency; (iii) low marketing
efficiency; including a lack of cooperative marketing arrangements which might
allow producers to receive a higher share of the final consumer price and have
more market influence; and (iv) high input prices and low input quality. The
project would address all such problems, through managerial and technical
assistance, training and cooperative action and credit. The increase in
output quantity from enterprises assisted should range from 20% for weavers
(where expected quality related price increases are more important) to 500%
for some confectioners (where production is currently very seasonal and demand
is far from satiated). Project-related rural income growth and the tapping of
new geographical and higher income market strata would help to strengthen the
market prospects for project non-farm enterprises.
VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Illustrative Farm Types
8.01      To reflect the variety of ecological and development conditions in
the project area, 17 illustrative farm models were constructed to represent
agricultural development for project beneficiaries. The charactertistics of
the sub-regions are described in Chapter 2 and summarized in Annex 2. In
view of existing similarities, the Northeast and Vale Rio Doce sub-areas
and the Zona da Mata and Sul de Minas sub-areas were grouped together, while
separate models were prepared for development on varzeas land, reforestation
and for swine production, applicable in all four sub-areas. The models were
based on surveys and information gathered by EMATER-MG and Bank missions and
represent three different farm types (0 to 10 ha, 10.1 to 50 ha, and 50.1 to
100 ha). The principal objective of on-farm development is to increase the
farm cropped area using underutilized lands, and improve farm productivity
through the use of better agricultural technology and farm management.

A description of on-farm development is given in Annex 14 and the assumed
distribution of cropped areas and the estimated number of particijants per farm
model is shown in Annex 14, Table 1.  To illustrate on-farm operation the
financial analysis and the cash flow projections were estimated for all farm
models. Four examples--crops, livestock, reforestation and land reclamation--
are presented in Annex 15. Prices of inputs, labor and production sold were
assumed to be those prevalent in the local market. Allowances were made for
climatic variation. It should be emphasized that the models are purely
illustrative and that the return in given years could vary considerably,
depending on rainfall and market trends, and that the final distribution
of production systems could also vary, depending on market and development
trends.
8.02      In general the financial rates of return of the farm models are high,
varying from 22% to over 50%. This reflects the fact that farmers will
receive credit and technical assistance for making changes in agricultural
practices, such as better land preparation, increased seeding rate, and use of
improved varieties and certified seeds, which have an important short term
impact on crop productivity. They would also receive assistance in improving
managerial practices, such as timely applications of agricultural chemicals,
proper timing of planting and better use of farm waste. Improved integration
of livestock production into the mixed cropping/livestock production system
would also provide the farmers with a more stable source of funds in the event
that climatic conditions adversely affect crop yields.



- 40 -
8.03      Where significant on-farm investment is planned, such as the recla-
mation of varzea land, it is expected to constitute a powerful incentive
to the small farmer for technological advancement. Furthermore, the financial
return to the farmer from the reclamation of varzea land will at least tempo-
rarily continue to be exaggerated for the small farmer until the subsidy
element of reclamation services is eliminated (see para 4.24). Similarly,
the return to the farmer of reforestation is increased as a result of the
state's decision to provide the project's low-income farmers with part of
the forestation inputs free of charge. The estimated financial rate of return
for all the farm models is presented in Annex 15, Table 7.
Non-Farm Activities
8.04      Based on recent surveys, four representative models were developed
as proxies for all non-registered small non-farm enterprises to show how the
combination of credit and technical-managerial assistance would affect them.
In Annex 16, Table 1 shows the condensed financial position of several enter-
prises and Table 2 shows one of the models. Rates of return on the models
varied from 31% to well over 50%. This reflects, in part, the very low
starting point in terms of quality of goods and efficiency of methods and
equipment. Gains in these areas, combined in some cases with formation of
producer cooperatives, would open new markets and expand old ones.
Farm Income
8.05      Wi:hout the project, the income of a typical potential participant
family has been estimited to average about US$1,000. It is expected that, as
a result of the project, family income would increase to some US$2,200 by
about project year 10. This implies an average cumulative annual increase of
8.2%. Expected development of family income is summarized below:

- 41 -
The smallest farmers (having less than 10 ha) starting from a per capita
farm income level less than a third of Brazil's relative poverty level (US$330)
are expected to increase their farm incomes by almost 80% in about four years.
Farmers with over 10 ha are likely to more than double their incomes. The
farm models suggest that for all expected beneficiaries, although the average
farm incomes would rise from 60% of the current relative poverty level to
130% of that level, about 55% of the beneficiaries would remain below the
pre-project poverty level, compared to an estimated 80% currently below that
level. Hence, most farmers will still need to supplement their income from
off-farm sources.
8.06      Farmers, cultivating less than 10 ha, most of whom live in the
Jequitinhonha Valley, are the poorest in Minas Gerais with an estimated family
farm income below US$200 a year (Annex 15, Table 6). These farmers are
migrating to urban centers and government is making an effort to slow rural
migration through special development programs, attempting to improve employ-
ment opportunities and living conditions. The project activities would
complement these programs and it is expected that the farm family income of
the project farmers in such category would also increase from less than US$200
to US$440 a year. The project effort would also create non-farm income earning
opportunities for the poorest farmers, by focussing assistance on small non-
farm enterprises in the northeast, and particularly in the Jequitinhonha
Valley.
Non-farm Income
8.07      Estimates of probable increases in income of project beneficiaries
directly assisted by the project have been computed in four enterprise models

is still more than 50%.

IX. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Economic Rate of Return
9.01      The economic rate of return for the project has been estimated
at 16%. Various aspects of the project such as investments made to improve
health, water supply, education services, community development and community
centers would have an important impact in improving living conditions in the
project area, but since the benefits attributable to these components are not
readily quantifiable, their costs have not been included in the economic rate
of return calculation. Costs and direct and indirect production benefits of
all other project components were included. The cost and benefit stream used
for economic analysis is presented in Table 1 of Annex 17.
9.02      The cost structure used in estimating the economic rate of return
included: (a) all on-farm and non-farm small industries investment and
incremental operating costs (based on the aggregation of all farm and non-farm
models), and (b) the off-farm investment and incremental operating costs directly
related to agricultural and small rural industries development during the project
period. The costs stream includes 100% of the project costs (baseline plus
physical contingencies) for land titling, agricultural research, land reclama-
tion, reforestation, marketing, cooperative development, small non-farm enter-
prise technical assistance, feeder roads, rural electrification and telephone
communications; 80% of overall project costs for administration and monitoring
(at least 20% of these costs are related to social activities of the project);
67% of rural extension service costs (33% of the rural extension services
are directly or indirectly related to social development activities); and 60%
of the costs of the evaluation component (lessons learned from the evaluation
of production and social components would mainly benefit subsequent projects).
Overall, about 79% of total project costs (excluding price contingencies) were
included in the costs stream. Also included are: (a) operating costs for the
period after project implementation that are needed to maintain project effects,
such as extension services for agricultural production and small non-farm
enterprises, marketing services and the maintenance of feeder roads; (b) the
costs of investments in secondary and feeder roads and in electrification
trunklines, complementary to the project but not included in financed project
costs; and (c) a rough estimate of incremental administration costs associated
with expanding the network of the rural credit system.
9.03      It should be noted that not all project benefits can be accounted
for by the incremental production of the 30,000 farmers and the 1,100 small
entrepreneurs directly assisted. Increases would also be achieved by other
rural producers as a result of the demonstration of such project activities
as agricultural extension and research. This effect would be particularly
important since direct project participants represent less than 40% of the
total farmers in the project area and are located in 102 scattered municipal-
ities. In addition, investment in the improvement of roads, rural electrifi-
cation and communication systems would have a positive effEct on other economic
activities within and outside the project area. These latter benefits were
not quantifiable.



- 43 -
9.04      An effort was made to capture the various project benefits in the
economic rate of return analysis. The benefit stream included: (a) all
on-farm and small non-farm incremental benefits brought about by increments
in crops, livestock, forestry and small industry production, based on the
aggregation of all farm and non-farm models; (b) an assumed increased produc-
tion indirectly derived from the demonstration effect and by the use of
improved services and infrastructure by farmers other than direct project
beneficiaries, the benefits to start after year 3 of project implementation
and be equivalent to an annual cumulative increase of about 3% until year 10,
after which they would level off; and (c) price adjustments to reflect, among
other things, project transport investment, quality differences and the level
of underemployment in the project area. The farmgate prices of products such
as beef, bananas, cotton and maize, which are exported, were adjusted to border
prices, with allowance for quality adjustment and farm-to-border transport
costs. Among inputs, labor warranted a special shadow price. Using 1970 data,
and assuming 5 persons per family, with 2.5 persons per family potentially
economically active, the project area contained 419,000 potential fulltime
workers. The same data show only 270,000 persons actually economically active,
35,000 of whom are "underemployed." Thus, the project's incremental labor
demand of some 15,600 worker-years at full development would not put much
pressure on wages. To reflect underutilization of labor during a period of
about six months, a shadow rate of Cr$ 50/day (50% below the market level) was
used in farm and non-farm cost calculations. The value of non-tradables was
multiplied by a consumption conversion factor of 1.15 calculated on the basis
of a project-specific formula to reflect trade distorting tariffs, subsidies,
export taxes and quantitative restrictions.
Sensitivity Analysis
9.05      The economic rate of return was not found to be especially sensitive
to changes in costs or benefits, as the results of the analysis show:
Best estimate:         16%
Cost up by 10%:        15%
Cost up by 20% and
benefits down 20%:  11%
Delay in implementa-
tion of 1 year:      14%
Elimination of demonstration benefits (para 9.04) from the benefit stream would
result in an economic rate of return of 14%.
9.06      The social components of the project (health, education, community
development and community centers) would improve living conditions, not only
for project beneficiaries, but for residents of the project area as a whole.
Such works would also interact with agricultural and industrial activities
to reinforce increased productivity and help create a self-sustained develop-
ment process.



- 44 -
Employment
9.07      The expected development of agricultural activities by 30,000
participating small farmers should generate new on-farm employment opportuni-
ties equivalent to 8,660 worker-years by year 5 and 12,840 worker-years by
year 10 (full development). Ancillary jobs resulting from the increased agri-
cultural production are estimated at 1,000 and permanent jobs resulting from
project execution activities, at 1,400. Based on local experience with and
surveys of small-scale enterprises, the project would create 2,800 new jobs
at an investment cost of around US$1,200 per job, well below alternative
employment creation costs in industry. Overall, therefore, the project can
be expected to generate the equivalent of some 18,040 new jobs.
9.08      Building on experiences under the first Minas Gerais Rural Development
Bank Project, the proposed project interventions have been tailored to reflect
the important role of women in farm families. The extension service agency,
EMATER-MG, has adopted a work approach which involves teams of agricultural
and social extension workers and a focus on the whole family as a socio-
economic unit. Extensionists would receive therefore one extra week of train-
ing about all the project aspects, enabling the extensionists to provide in
the normal course of their work appropriate information to all family members.
Other executing agencies also increasingly integrate women in their program,
as staff members as well as beneficiaries. An important number of women
participated in the preparation of the project, and, during implementation,
emphasis would be placed on furthering this trend.
Fiscal Impact
9.09      The project costs of agricultural and small rural industries investment,
production support services, and physical and social infrastructure (including
contingencies) would amount to about US$5,950 for each of the approximately
31,000 rural families directly benefited by the project. This figure, however,
overstates the cost per family to the extent that agricultural and small rural
industries activities would generate important demonstration and employment
benefits beyond the direct target group of 31,000 rural families. It is
expected that the direct and indirect project benefits would reach some 85,000
rural families. The extent to which credit for on-farm project costs would be
recovered in real terms is difficult to estimate because of the current
inflationary environment in Brazil and the Government's policy of providing
subsidized credit. Assuming a continuing inflation rate similar to the
average over the last three years (52%) credit recovery for on-farm investment
costs could well be very low. On the other hand, a decline in inflation or a
continuation of the gradual reduction in the size of agricultural credit
subsidies (a process in which initial, though still marginal, steps were
recently taken by the Government (para 4.10)) would result in higher investment
credit recovery. Of the estimated US$181.1 million in off-farm total project
and program costs including contingencies (i.e., those other than on-farm
investment, incremental working capital and rural electrification; see also
Annex 7), it is expected that around US$71 million (about 39%) would be
recuperated during project execution through direct and indirect user charges
(i.e., storage, water supply, electricity tariff, road and gasoline taxes),
financial contributions of beneficiaries (particularly in health, education
and community center components), and taxes on incremental agricultural and
small industry production.



- 45 -
9.10      After year 5 of project implementation, the Government would incur
additional annual costs, falling from US$3.2 million in year 6 to US$1.0
million in year 10 and after. These expenses would be incurred principally
for extension services for farm and non-farm enterprises but would also include
continued operating costs of the marketing component and the maintenance of
'eeder roads. These additional recurrent expenditures are expected, however,
to be covered easily by additional revenues of roughly US$5.5 million annually
realized from ICM and FUNRURAL taxes which would apply to the incremental
production of direct agricultural and small rural industry project participants.
Environmental Impact
9.11      The project should have a beneficial environmental impact.  The area
under crop cultivation by project beneficiaries would increase moderately by
about 20,000 ha, or 4% of total farm area (para 8.01). The cultivated area
would, in general, be improved as a result of better farm management and the
planting of some additional tree crops and reforestation of 10,000 ha, both
resulting in improved erosion control. The project would also provide for
control of schistosomiasis infection in varzeas land to be reclaimed by
project beneficiaries, and it would reduce the chances of water contamination
by increasing the number of sanitation facilities.
Project Risks
9.12      The project's success depends on the commitment of the executing
staff in all ranks of the participating agencies. These agencies will imple-
ment a great number of activities in a wide region under variable ecological
circumstances. Work will need to be carried out in a timely fashion and in
a coordinated manner at the local, regional and central level. The risk of
not achieving adequate inter-agency integration, and, hence, project targets,
is, however, lessened by the full involvement of the staff of the executing
agencies in project preparation, the level of pre-project implementation of
essential organizational measures, the strong line organization of the
executing agencies, the experience obtained by these agencies under the
First (Zona da Mata) Rural Development project, and the extensive training
incorporated in this project.
9.13      Another risk lies in the absorption capacity of the isolated or
neglected municipalities, but this would be minimized by the project's emphasis
on adequate communication systems and its fully integrated character. There
is another risk of protracted dry periods, but this is counter-balanced by
concentrating on the development of the cultivation of varzeas in the dry
northern regions, and supporting non-farm employment development. Extensive
crop experimentation and intensified extension services should also help to
reduce the negative impact of drought. There is also some risk that the
expected yields would not be attained. This risk is, however, within an
acceptable margin, because the average yield increases were estimated taking
into account periodic dry periods. The project would benefit directly or
indirectly about 85,000 families (or 425,000 people). The benefits of raising
the living standard in the rural poverty areas of the State and the long-term
benefit of creating an institutional implementation capability able to sustain
independently the rural development process make the project risks acceptable.

Criteria for Assistance to Communities Under the Project
Community Development
1.        The characteristics of a community to be selected for assistance under
the community development component should be as follows:
(a) the community should be receiving assistance from
EMATER-MG or SETASl/;
(b) the community should be located in the project area
at least 10 km from the municipal center and have the
potential to develop into a center for adjacent small
communities;
(c) the communities must be accessible by road and be
composed mostly of low-income producers: and
(d) the community should consist of a minimum of 150 families,
of which at least 20% live in a village center. The
village should possess at least two centers for social
activities, such as a church/community center or a school/
health post.
Community Centers
2.        To be eligible for project assistance in constructing a community
center, a community should be eligible for assistance in community development
and, in addition, should:
(a) have, within a 3-km radius, more than 150 schoolage
children (between 7 and 14);
(b) have available reasonably flat and adequate building

Fund for Community Development (FUND)
3.        To be eligible for financing by the Fund, a sub-project should be
formally proposed by a community assisted by SETAS or EMATER-MG. The Fund
would finance only investment costs and limit the financial assistance to
US$10,000 per sub-project and US$20,000 per community. The Fund would not
finance sub-projects, which could be: (a) financed under other project
components (such as feeder roads, water supply, health posts and such); (b)
financed by gther existing programs or organizations (such as LBA, PRODECOM,
SETAS, CEAPS and church and voluntary organizations); or (c) sponsored by formal
entities (grupos de acao de base), such as community councils, which could
generate financial assistance from the public sector. In addition, sub-projects
should:
(a) be located in communities assisted by the project;
(b) be technically and operationally viable and approved
by the extension workers of SETAS or EMATER-MG, each
within their institutional competence;
(c) be supported by counterpart resources from the commu-
nity, in labor, material or financial inputs, of at
least 40% of the project costs;
(d) reach directly or indirectly as many beneficiaries as
possible, improve income and well-being of community
members, have an educational and promotional character,
and serve as a demonstration for other communities; and
(e) generate sufficient returns to contribute to a formally
established and administered community fund, which would
finance future community activities.

SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Procedures of Disbursements Against Statements of Expenses
(SOE)
Budgeting and Funding
1.        Each executing agency would conclude a contract (convenio) with the
Secretary of Planning and the Secretary of Agriculture, stating its obligations
under the contract, including objectives, physical targets and available funds
during each year of the project period. Each participating agency would prepare
annually before August 31 a working plan and budget for the next year. After
review by the Project's Coordinating Unit, these plans would be discussed by the
consultative technical group and thereafter presented to the State Council for
approval (see organization chart, Annex 11). The budgets would include a draw-
down scheme. The participating banks are rediscounted by the Central Bank.
Expenses to be Covered by SOE's
2.        Disbursements against standard documentation cover the procurement of
civil works (including feeder roads which are constructed under contracts,
community centers, health centers, water supply systems constructed under
contracts, storage facilities, and retail stores); vehicles; tractors; equipment;
and consultancies and technical assistance. These disbursements would cover about
25% of the project expenses.
3.        SOEs would be used for works and expenses where full documentation is
impractical, such as:
(a) works executed by force account (feeder roads with a limit of
20% of the total length of feeder roads improved or constructed
under the project and water supply systems);
(b) agricultural credit and credit for rural electrification,
extended under rural credit conditions by BB, BEMG, CEE
and BCRI./;
(c) project-financed operating costs of project management,
monitoring and evaluation, EMATER-MG, EPAMIG, IEF, SUDECOOP,
RURALMINAS, CAMIG, SEE, SEA and SETAS;
(d) costs for the baseline studies, marketing studies by EPAMIG,
CAMIG and SETAS, community studies by SETAS and the curriculum
studies for SEE; and
1/ A glossary of abbreviations and acronyms is provided inside the front
cover of this report.

Page 2 of 3
(e) consultancy services in project management and RURALMINAS
for organizational improvement and in DER-MG for the assistance
in the implementation of the maintenance plan for municipal roads.
SOE Procedure
4.        The SOEs would be summarized on Application Form IC for the credit
component and on Form 1B for all other components. An annex showing monthly
expenditures by each participating agency (Balancete) would be attached to
Form 1B. These annexes would contain a basic breakdown of the totals on Form
1B as follows:
(a) personnel costs (salaries, wages and such);
(b)  materials (material de consumo)-office supplies,
gasoline, oil and such);
(c) general services (third party payments covering
utilities, short term contracts and such); and
(d) various operating expenses.
Reimbursement for permanent fixtures, equipment and installation would be made
on the basis of normal documentation.
5.        Basic headings would be broken down in the same annex as to the costs
per subregion, per location of work performed or expenses incurred (such as
costs of a regional office), cost per performed job (such as a specific road
section) and costs per group or types of beneficiaries, Adequate cross-reference
should be made to the underlying documentation. Additional data required to
facilitate proper control may be worked out during implementation.
Internal Control by the Project
6.        The executing agencies have established accounting systems, audited by
internal auditors, the auditor general of the State, independent auditors or
federal auditors, and maintain separate project accounts. A full-time manager
within each executing agency would assist in keeping the accounts up to date and
in maintaining separate accounts for each major job. An administrative unit in
the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) would consolidate the project accounts and
be responsible for the financial control of project expenditures.
7.        The SOEs would be prepared monthly by the executing agencies and
remitted to the PCU through the project managers. After counter-signing by the
project director, the SOEs would be sent to the Secretary of Planning for approval
and forwarding to the Bank. The basic documents of the SOEs would be retained by
the executing agencies. During this process, the statements would be controlled
at the various levels by the responsible coordinators and actual expenses compared
with the estimated expenses specified in the annual project budget and project
estimates specified in the convenios.

8.        The project manager in each executing agency would keep, in addition to
the basic accounting documents, a file containing copies of the most important
internal control measures and instructions, such as:
(a) administrative and accounting procedures of the agency;
(b)  indemnization rules, such as tariffs, per diems, and transport
and lodging allowances applicable to personnel working for
the project;
(c) general control instructions, such as mileages allowed and
type of log books to be kept;
(d) contracts used as a basis for calculation of expenses, such
as rental contracts, public services (water and electricity)
and tariffs; and
(e) special requirements under the project.
Auditing
9.        The project accounts would be audited by the Inspetoria Geral de Finances
(IGF) of the Ministry of Finance in Brasilia within six months after the end of
each fiscal year. The IGF would be asked to include in its audit a special
statement about proper execution of the SOE procedures by the executing agencies
and the PCU.

SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Development
General
1.       Rainfall distribution, topography, temperature and soil quality vary
considerably between and within the project regions, and the farming systems
have been adapted to the ecological circumstances. In the Northeast, the average
small farm has 17.0 ha, with 1.8 ha cultivated, medium and large farms produce
cattle, cotton and forestry products while small farmers concentrate around
varzeas and cultivate subsistence crops and cotton. In the Vale Rio Doce, with
2.5 ha cultivated on the average small farm of 25.9 ha, large farmers concentrate
on subsistence crops and coffee. The average Zona da Mata small farm has 2.5 ha
cultivated, out of an average of 20.7 ha. This is predominantly a dairy region
with steady development of rice, vegetable and fruit production; small livestock;
and subsistence crops. In Sul de Minas, where the average small farm of 22.4 ha
cultivates 2.7 ha, large farmers produce coffee and cattle while small farmers
concentrate on subsistence crops, dairying and horticulture.
Farm and Crop Development
2.        Project area small farmers make very little use of modern, efficient
technology in their ,roduction activities and have not been exposed to new
farm management tech::iques. Basically, the need to reduce risks in production
and marketing constrain most management decisions of the small farmers. Thus,
they commonly practice intercropping (especially of maize and beans) to reduce
the risks of prolonged drought and to maximize rainy period output. Livestock
production (broadly including beef and dairy cattle, pigs, poultry, rabbits,
fish and bees) also attracts them as a way of reducing drought risks, hedging
against inflation, providing a ready reserve for emergencies, and making more
productive use of available land. The project would directly address small
farmer problems by offering a combination of on-farm and off-farm improvements.
The former would be based on improved farm management techniques, which would
result in better timing of farm activities and use of improved seeds and planting
material (particularly of corn, cotton and beans); application of more productive
cultivation techniques; increased use of on-farm storage; diversification into
commercial crops such as garlic, bananas and tomatoes; inclusion of livestock,
land reclamation and reforestation in farm plans; and, after the farmer becomes
sufficiently skilled in farm management, use of land rotation. Actual needs
governing the introduction of each of these methods would be established in
cooperation with the research and extension staff for each ecological area. Off-
farm improvements, aimed mainly at improved input supply and marketing, include
major feeder road activities, communications and market information improvements,
better retail outlets and expansion of storage facilities.
Farm Models
3.        Based on differing ecological characteristics and a wide range of
technical and price data, 21 models were developed to illustrate the range of
farm types and sizes among the target group. Of these, 17 were selected as most
representative and grouped into two regions (Northeast-Vale Rio Doce and Zona
da Mata-Sul de Minas). They are summarized in Table 1, and four examples are



- 77 -                            ANNEX 14
Page 2Tof 2
given in Tables 2 through 5. The models should be considered as illustrations
of possible developments rather than determinants of a firm estimate of project
wide activities. The mix of crops must ultimately be adapted to specific regions
(such as cotton and garlic in the Northeast) and to developing markets (such as
vegetable and fruit crops for the metropolitan areas) and to new developments
(such as reforestation). Farmers would probably adopt crop mixes more variable
than those shown in the models; the products included in the models are partially
proxy crops, representing similar produce such as bananas for fruit products,
tomatoes for vegetables and maize and beans for subsistence crops. Despite these
caveats, the models are formulated and distributed in a way roughly approximating
the actual target group position.
4.        The project's effect on this group is reflected in the models.  All
models assume conservative yield and material input projections based on tested
field results and experience from other projects. They include the estimated
effects of an extended dry period every five years. They also include an
allowance for fallow land. The project would aim to introduce small farmers to
the institutional credit system, whereafter they would become direct clients of
local banks. The probable maximum required credit is shown as computed from farm
model data:

For many of the small farmers in the 0-10 ha range, investment requirements would
be below the US$100 level. Although considered in the illustrative calculations
as subject to investment loans, they would usually, in practice, be included in
working capital loans, or shorter-term investment loans (e.g., well under the
applied 8 year term including 3 years of grace).
5.        The models foresee some 63% of all non-electrification credit being used for
investment and 37% for seasonal credit. Livestock activities, financed only as
part of a mixed crop-livestock plan to assure optimal use of land and investments,
would require about 60% of this investment credit. Livestock purchases would
constitute about 40% of total livestock credit, with the remainder used for pasture
improvement, fencing, stable improvement and silage. Reforestation would require
17% of total non-electrification investment credit; land reclamation, 7%; on-
farm storage, 5%; and purchase of tools, equipment and other investments, 11%.
Replacement of tools for soil tillage and all other operating costs are included
in operating expenses. As for labor requirements, the models used a daily wage
rate of Cr$100, or US$2.36. Model farm families average five persons, who can
supply up to 650 man-days of labor per year. The heaviest seasonal labor
requirements are from August to January, with peak requirements being met by
family labor or by hiring from the underemployed pool in the project area.
The incremental labor requirements total 8,660 man-years in year 5 and 12,840
man-years at full development. At full development, 90% of the incremental
man-years would be provided by family labor.

Economic Analysis of Non-Registered Small Non-Farm Enterprises
General
1.        The non-registered small enterprises are the smallest producing non-
farm units in the project area, with an average size of 2.2 employees, fixed
investments of Cr$13,000 and annual sales of about Cr$60,000. They are diverse
in products and problems. They produce food products such as flour and sweets
(25%), wood and bamboo products such as artwork, lumber and furniture (15%),
fiber products such as blankets, clothing and wall hangings (16%), leather productE
such as saddles and footwear (11%), clay, cement and non-metallic mineral products
for building, storage and art (18%) metal products such as farm tools, including
repair work (5%), and a variety of other products and services (10%). Their main
problem is scarcity of credit. They also have problems in product quality,
quality and availability of equipment and inputs, level of employee skills, work-
place and storage facilities, and marketing. These enterprises exist in every
locale, and are probably under-counted in every survey. It is estimated that
about 2,400 exist in the project area, 1,500 of these in the municipios directly
served by the component. With the important exception of producers of art and
handicrafts, they serve a clientele primarily local (75%) and of low income.
Being non-registered, they keep no records, pay no taxes and recruit unorganized
labor from the local population. Finally, they recognize that in most cases they
can expand their production and income by making capital and human investments,
and in many cases by organizing cooperative input supply and marketing arrangement!
Economic Analysis
2.        Surveys of project area non-registered small enterprises allowed the
estimation of models of typical enterprises and frequency of enterprises by type,
Each model was assumed to represent a percentage of the 950 enterprises to receive
credit. It is estimated that enterprises would increase their net incomes by 60%
to over 100%. Market prices were used for enterprise inputs and outputs since
almost none of these goods are imported or exported by Brazil. Wages were set at
50% of the market level to compensate for low productivity and underemployment.
The incremental net benefits of the 950 enterprises to receive credit were
matched against total incremental project costs (personnel, materials, services,
training, consultancies and physical investments, adjusted upward to correct
for exchange rate distortion) over a period of 20 years. Financial rates of re-
turn on the models range from 31% to over 100%, and the economic rate of return on
the entire component is 31%. This high rate results in part from not attributing
any portion of project costs outside of the small enterpise component (roads,
electrification, etc.) to small enterprise incremental net benefits.
