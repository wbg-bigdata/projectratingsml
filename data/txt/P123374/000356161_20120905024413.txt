F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The overall objective of the PRMG DPO is to assist the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe to
improve public sector effectiveness. This objective will be achieved by: (i) raising the transparency and
accountability in the management of public resources with a focus on improving budget transparency and
accountability and the implementation of pro-poor expenditures, improving the management of public
accounts and assets, and strengthening the oversight framework for public enterprises; and (ii) promoting
sustainable economic policies by strengthening the fiscal policy framework including the management of
public debt, and by improving donor coordination.

Revised Program Development Objectives (if any, as approved by original approving
authority)

The Project Development Objectives were not revised.

achievement)    The budget target for pro-poor expenditures was not feasible given that the pro-poor
                expenditures (as specified in the budget) were largely dependent on commitments from
                non-traditional donors that did not materialize because of changes in the global economy
                that affected them. Yet, the fact that pro-poor expenditures are being tracked in the
                budget and the fact that the executed rate of internally-financed pro-poor expenditures
                was 94 percent reflects a strong Government commitment. The PRMG DPO funds,
                which were disbursed in October 2011, were used to achieve this 94 percent execution
                rate of internally-financed pro-poor expenditures.

                It is also important to note that the budgeted amount for pro-poor expenditures in 2011
                was equivalent to over 30 percent of GDP, which is very high (the pro-poor expenditures
                that were executed represented more than 10 percent of GDP in 2011). This is a
                structural issue concerning challenges in budgetary projections in an aid-dependent small
                island nation. In this context, the Government is working closely with development
                partners to improve, over the medium-term, the quality of pro-poor budget codes, and
                more importantly, to improve the system of budget preparation, implementation, and
                supervision, by reviewing the realism of budgetary assumptions, preparing mid-year
                budget reviews, and issuing supplementary budgets.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
This implementation completion report (ICR) is prepared following the closing of the Public Resource
Management and Governance Reform (PRMG) development policy operation (DPO), a grant of US$4.2
million provided to the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe (STP). This operation was
designed as a stand-alone operation, to be consistent with the approach in the Bank’s Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) for 2011-2012, discussed by the Bank’s Board on May 2011.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) is a small and fragile island state. STP is one of the smallest economies in
Africa with about 170,000 inhabitants and a gross national income (GNI) per capita of US$1,275 (2011). The
country faces many development challenges due to its small size, limited institutional capacity, and aid
dependency. STP is highly vulnerable to terms of trade shocks and largely dependent on imports, even for
food products. The country is also unable to take advantage of economies of scale in the provision of
infrastructure, services, and economic activities because of its small size. These constraints limit its flexibility
to adapt to shocks and provide few opportunities for risk diversification within the small domestic market.
Production is therefore limited while high transaction costs raise export costs. These constraints limited
the economy’s resilience to external shocks when it became impacted by the 2008-2009 global economic
and financial slowdown.

At appraisal, it was noted that despite its inherent constraints, STP’s economy had experienced a
decade with its fastest growth since independence in 1975. Growth had averaged 5.2 percent between 2001
and 2010, compared to 1.4 percent on average during 1990-2000, fostered by rising cocoa prices, petroleum
exploration bonus payments, and increased private consumption and investment in private activities
(construction of hotels and resorts, and financial services) led by FDI in anticipation of potential oil
production. GDP per capita had improved by about 4 percent on average during this period. The economy had
been relatively successful in avoiding major macroeconomic imbalances despite suffering a succession of
shocks. Concerns on fiscal sustainability given uncertainties regarding the influx of future oil bonuses and
rapid inflation had led to a strengthening of fiscal and monetary discipline. Nonetheless, as STP embarked on
fiscal consolidation, the economy was hard hit by two shocks: a sharp increase in international food and fuel
prices between 2007 and 2008, and the global slowdown since 2009. The impact of these shocks led to a sharp
decline in donor aid and foreign investment, coupled with a delay in the arrival of oil signature bonuses.
This, in turn, slowed down economic growth to 4 percent in 2009, acutely affecting the country’s efforts
to reduce poverty. These shocks also limited the pace of fiscal consolidation by impacting badly on the public
finances, with the domestic primary deficit rising from 6 percent of GDP in 2007 to 9.1 percent in 2009.

Poverty had remained insidious, with its incidence standing at 54 percent and with those in extreme poverty
comprising 15 percent of STP’s population based on information from the 2001 Household Survey. To address
these extremely high levels, the Government had implemented a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
beginning in 2003. A PRSP Unit had been made operational in 2005 to supervise PRSP implementation. A
Committee had been appointed in 2008 to develop a new PRSP, which was initially expected to be completed
by 2009, following the updating of the poverty profile. However, preparation of the strategy was hindered by
delays in the preparation of a household survey that would have buttressed the updating of the poverty profile.
At the time of appraisal, it was not clear if the PRSP would be completed within the time frame initially
envisaged. Notably, the Public Resource Management and Government (PRMG) Development Policy
Operation supported the Government’s efforts to accelerate the preparation of the new PRSP, which was to be
based on a results-oriented pro-poor growth approach. Indeed, given the uncertainties that had arisen in
previous years related to the prospects for petroleum production, the STP authorities had emphasized the
importance of promoting private sector led growth to reduce poverty.

                                                         1
Despite the difficulties encountered, the Government had made continued efforts to implement the
PRSP and achieve its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). At the time of appraisal, the UNDP
Human Development Report ranked São Tomé and Príncipe 131th out of 182 countries, comparable to oil
producing middle income countries in the region such as Namibia (128) and South Africa (129). Sector
analyses and administrative data showed that improvements had taken place since 2001, especially in health
and education indicators, which remained above the Sub-Saharan region average. Although many indicators
had improved, such as life expectancy at birth, mortality rate, birth rate, and primary completion rate, these
indicators remained weak while progress toward achieving the MDGs was slow and difficult to measure.

The Government had been effective in improving education and health conditions. STP received an
Education for All-Fast Track Initiative endorsement in 2007. Structural reforms increased the official primary
net enrollment ratio, putting it within reach of the universal primary completion rate by 2015. However,
educational quality remained a concern, reflecting the low level of teachers’ qualifications and limited learning
time associated with the operation of a triple shift regime. Health delivery services had improved, particularly
maternal health and child health care, and STP had been successful in reducing malaria incidence. On the HIV
front, prevalence among pregnant women had dropped sharply. These gains notwithstanding, the public
delivery of social services remained constrained by difficulties in evaluating the implementation of strategies at
the time of appraisal. The 2008 Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) that assessed the PRSP’s annual progress
report had signaled the existence of poor data collection, compilation, interpretation, and dissemination, as well
as an inadequate evaluation and monitoring system for the MDGs as major evaluation constraints. In response,
with support from the PRMG Development Policy Operation (DPO) preparation efforts, the authorities had
improved data collection and compilation; monitored public expenditures linked to poverty reduction
objectives, and developed pro-poor budget codes. Prior to the PRMG DPO, these budget codes had not been
utilized to allocate resources for pro-poor expenditures in the budget.

Overall, at the time of appraisal, it was evident that successive governments had introduced a series
of structural reforms to address STP’s developmental issues. Structural reforms were introduced and
aimed at: (i) pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies; (ii) strengthening governance and the
efficiency of public spending; (iii) liberalizing the economy by reducing trade and tariff barriers and by
privatizing several state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including the telecommunications company; (iv)
building up human capital by introducing new strategies in health and education; and (v) developing
institutional capacities, especially in the nascent petroleum sector. A credible track record in economic
management was established, providing STP access to debt relief in 2007, when STP reached the
Completion Point of the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and received
US$314 million in debt relief. Notwithstanding progress on these areas, there remained an urgent need to
strengthen the transparency of public finances, better prioritize spending in order to keep total expenditure
within available resources, improve fiscal policy and the oversight of public enterprises, strengthen donor
coordination, and improve monitoring and evaluation systems, particularly the completion of the new
PRSP.

A broad political consensus has supported the reform effort. STP consolidated democratic rule since 1991
holding free and fair elections. Political freedom, particularly freedom of the press, has been a key
characteristic of the country’s democratic evolution. A broad political consensus supported macroeconomic
stability, good governance, stronger public financial management, and sector reforms to foster growth and
reduce poverty. Nonetheless, while governance reforms had been supported by successive governments,
frequent government changes and a sluggish decision making processes had contributed to a much slower than
desired pace of reform implementation. In August 2010, a new government coalition led by the Democratic
Action Party (ADI) won 26 out of 55 National Assembly seats (two seats short of an absolute majority). ADI
formed a coalition with the Force for Change Democratic Movement Party, which holds one seat, signaling the


                                                        2
need for political compromise with other political parties to ensure that the reform agenda would be
maintained with the support of all parties.

The oil production outlook posed and continues to pose risks to the public debt sustainability
outlook. In 2001, STP established a Joint Development Zone (JDZ) with Nigeria to manage the exploitation
of their potential oil resources. The agreement foresaw that 40 percent of benefits and obligations stemming
from the JDZ would accrue to STP. Since 2005 STP had received US$77.8 million (about 40 percent of GDP)
in oil exploration bonuses. In parallel, STP established an institutional and legislative framework to exploit
potential hydrocarbon resources in its own Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). At the time of appraisal, the
most important issue facing STP’s medium-term economic outlook was whether or not oil production
would take place since oil might not be produced in commercially viable quantities as it is located in deep
waters. Uncertainties as to the feasibility of offshore oil production materializing underscored the urgent
need to address fiscal policy management issues in order to avoid a derailment of STP’s economic
program and also to refocus its new development strategy under the assumption that oil might not be
produced in order to ensure its sustainability.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of the DPO, as stated in the Project Document (PD), was to assist the Government of São Tomé
and Príncipe to improve public sector effectiveness. This objective will be achieved by: (i) raising the
transparency and accountability in the management of public resources with a focus on improving budget
transparency and accountability and the implementation of pro-poor expenditures, improving the management
of public accounts and assets, and strengthening the oversight framework for public enterprises; and (ii)
promoting sustainable economic policies by strengthening the fiscal policy framework including the
management of public debt, and by improving donor coordination. The program development objectives
were consistent with the objectives of the Interim Strategy Note 2011-2012.

The key performance indicators, as outlined in the program summary of the PD and Letter of Development
Policy, were as follows:

       The 2011 budget proposal, the approved Budget Law, as well as the March, June, and September
        Quarterly Budget Implementation Reports are published in the Government’s website.

       Budget execution of pro-poor expenditures for 2011 is at least 90 percent.

       Pilot public accounting statistics (up to September 2011) are produced.

       By December 31, 2011 the Ministry of Finance and International Cooperation publishes an
        updated database of mobile public assets for all ministries in the Government’s website.

       A diagnosis study of the financial practices for at least Two State-Owned Enterprises is
        completed.

       As of December 31, 2011, all outstanding public debt is published in the Government’s website
        and all new public debt is signed by the Minister of Finance.

       At least one donor roundtable has been conducted to improve aid harmonization and effectiveness
        and to update the database on external assistance.

The program’s intention was to strengthen the institutional infrastructure needed to build up the
public sector’s capacity to better deliver key services and support growth. To this end, the PRMG
DPO supported implementation of the Government’s reform program by focusing on: (i) improving budget
transparency and implementing pro-poor expenditures; (ii) strengthening the management of public accounts
and assets; (iii) enhancing the oversight and financial controls of public enterprises; (iv) strengthening payroll
management; (v) strengthening the framework for managing fiscal policy including public debt; and (vi)
enhancing donor coordination. The operation also supported preparation of a new PRSP based on an updated
poverty profile originating from a new Household Survey (with data collected from 2010) and an analysis of
growth diversification options. An important benefit to be accrued was that the work of the government
departments involved in public financial management (PFM) would be facilitated as a result of the PRMG
operation.

Consolidation of ongoing PFM reforms and protecting priority spending were deemed to be essential
priorities of the PRMG DPO. To ensure that these priorities were achieved, this operation focused on
consolidating and accelerating PFM reforms that had earlier been identified as critical in the Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), the Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) Review, as well as in STP’s Country Economic Memorandum (CEM)
under preparation at the time of the appraisal. To ensure maintaining the focus on fiscal consolidation, these
reforms were integrated into two pillars: (a) raising the transparency and accountability in the management of
public resources; and (b) promoting sustainable policies. The pillars, in turn, were disaggregated according to
the policy areas supported by the operation. These policy areas are summarized below.

    (a) Raising the Transparency and Accountability in the Management of Public Resources

       1. Improving budget transparency
STP lacked transparency and accountability with respect to budget formulation. Although budget
proposals were sent for approval to the National Assembly, budget information was not disseminated beyond
the National Assembly and, thus, not available for public discussion. As a result, an informed public debate
of expenditure priorities could not be held. In response to the weaknesses identified in budget formulation, the
authorities aimed to promote an informed debate on prioritizing public expenditures.

       2. Improve budget accountability so that the budget reflects the priorities of the Government

Pro-poor expenditures were not specified in the budget even though pro-poor budget codes that would
have allowed their specification in the budget had been created in 2008. In this context, the authorities
aimed to facilitate the supervision of pro-poor expenditures and strengthening PRSP’s financial
implementation through a better monitoring of pro-poor budget expenditures. To this end, the 2011 budget
proposal specified pro-poor expenditures during 2007-10, and also their proposed amounts for 2011.
Following the PRSP objectives, the Government committed itself to publishing and monitoring the execution
of pro-poor expenditures. The purpose of this initiative was to identify the intended beneficiaries of such
expenditures and monitor specific allocations aimed at promoting pro-poor growth.

    (b) Promoting Sustainable Economic Policies

       3. Strengthening the management of public accounts
Annual statements were not being produced, which impaired the management of public accounts. The
failure to produce annual statements meant that an annual audit could not be conducted by the Court of
Accounts. To improve public sector accountability, the authorities aimed to make operational the Directorate
of Public Accounting and to budget training activities for its staff. This Directorate was to become responsible
for preparing a public accounting manual and subsequently the public accounts of the State. With support from
the PRMG DPO, the authorities were to prepare public accounting statistics that would form the basis of the
public accounts, with the medium-term objective of submitting the public accounts to the external auditor for a
financial audit. Over the medium-term, the Government’s intention was to adopt an accounting framework
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and undertake yearly internal controls of the
financial accounts. These actions would ensure the recording in the public accounts of all budgetary, financial,
and asset operations, and that public accounting statistics would be made in a reliable and consistent manner,
as well as harmonized with those of the Central Bank.

       4. Strengthening the management of public assets

STP lacked information on mobile assets and guidelines on how to manage them. STP did not have
guidelines for the management of public assets or an updated registry of public assets. Therefore,
government officials were not able to monitor and control assets, thus opening up the possibility of mobile
assets being used for private benefit. With support from the PRMG DPO, the authorities were to improve the
management of mobile public assets and carry out a comprehensive inventory of existing mobile public assets
for sector ministries. The inventory and its related manual of operations were to become critical elements for
designing a more effective public management system based on a centralized database for public assets and on
improved procedures for monitoring, controlling, and replenishing assets. Existing problems of inadequate
public assets use were expected to be reduced, thereby improving public sector accountability.

       5. Enhancing the oversight and financial controls of public enterprises
There was a lack of oversight of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). The poor performance of SOEs
penalized the private sector and put fiscal sustainability at risk. SOE problems originated because of the
lack of a legal framework for evaluating public enterprises. For instance, SOEs’ weak financial situation
led to high contingent liabilities and transfers from the Government, making it difficult for them to
maintain sound fiscal operations. To address these issues, the authorities aimed to strengthen legislation
governing SOEs and on setting clear managerial structures for improving their administrative and financial
controls. A key government objective was to improve the oversight of the financial performance of SOEs.
With support from the PRMG DPO, the Government was to carry out diagnosis studies of SOEs financial
practices involving the Ministry of Finance and International Cooperation (MFIC) and line ministries.

       6. Strengthening payroll management
Payroll management was undermined by the lack of complete personnel records and of a personnel
database. Personnel management was undermined by the lack of reconciliation between distinct personnel
information at the MFIC and the Ministry of Public Administration that may have allowed ghost workers to
enter into the payroll system. These issues emerged because the relevant government employee information
was not centralized in a single database. With support from the PRMG DPO, the Government planned to
complete a headcount of government employees, and also planned to set up a system so that payroll records of
its employees would be updated on a regular basis. More specifically, it planned to integrate payroll registry
into the sophisticated SAFE-e software system (an integrated public financial management system).



                                                       5
       7. Strengthening fiscal policy management (public debt)

Unclear procedures to contract public debt were affecting fiscal sustainability. The Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) pointed out that STP’s risk of debt distress was (and continues to be) high. Debt
management was also weak due to an outdated institutional framework. Indeed, STP failed to meet the
minimum Debt Management and Performance Assessment (DeMPA) requirements, especially concerning the
legal framework and management structures. A key objective of the Government was to strengthen the
legislative framework governing public debt management and enhance transparency by publishing details of
public debt on a regular basis.

       8. Strengthening fiscal policy management (fiscal responsibility)
Fiscal policy management was deemed to be a critical area in ensuring the sustainability of economic
policies. The failure to ensure adequate fiscal policy management had led to persistent deficits and pro-cyclical
policies, as well as to rising debt levels. These problems had been traced to the absence of systems and
procedures to implement sustainable fiscal policies. With support from the PRMG DPO, the authorities
planned to develop a Fiscal Responsibility Framework in line with international best practice so as to avoid
pro-cyclicality in fiscal policy. Such a framework would enable the budget process to become more
hierarchical by providing procedural rules that would guarantee fiscal compliance and avoid misuse of political
discretion in budgetary allocation and execution. The aim of the Fiscal Responsibility Framework was to
increase public sector accountability by raising budget transparency and setting up medium term commitments
for the fiscal deficit and public debt.

       9. Enhancing donor coordination

Lack of a formal consultative mechanism for coordinating donor assistance reduced public sector
efficiency. Although donors contributed to finance more than half of STP’s total budget, this assistance was
not closely coordinated with the country’s development strategy and priorities. Recurrent expenditures of
investment projects were not adequately planned for, which caused serious budget shortfall problems later on.
To ensure stronger coordination of donor assistance, the authorities intended to adopt a new cooperation
framework in order to raise aid effectiveness, and prepared a draft Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to
harmonize donor assistance around STP’s strategy. This MoU would allow periodical exchange of information
through a formal consultative mechanism, fostering debate, and improving medium-term expenditure
planning. With support from the PRMG DPO, the authorities were to organize, for the first time, a donor
meeting to improve aid harmonization and to create a database of donor-funded projects.

       10. Preparing a new results-oriented Poverty Reduction Strategy
The outdated PRSP I affected medium term policy design. STP’s development policy strategy was not
sufficiently explicit on key priorities or on budget allocations. The lack of explicitness arose because
PRSP I was not results oriented while lacking adequate monitoring indicators to follow up on results.
These flaws in policy design generated difficulties in the coordination of medium term policies. With
support from the PRMG DPO, the authorities were to accelerate the preparation of a new PRSP intended
to update the country’s poverty goals in line with the new macroeconomic framework being developed
and foster a growth strategy that would benefit the poor through increased employment and income. The
new development strategy was to be prepared in a participatory manner and was to be submitted to the
World Bank and IMF for endorsement.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Program Performance

This operation was a single tranche operation, disbursed upon effectiveness. It focused on policy
measures aimed principally at (i) raising transparency and accountability in the management of public
resources; and (ii) promoting sustainable economic policies by strengthening the fiscal policy framework and
improving donor coordination. The grant also supported preparation of a new PRSP based on an updated
poverty profile originating from a 2010 Household Survey and an analysis of growth diversification options.
The operation’s prior actions focused on increasing the transparency and accountability of budget preparation
so that the budget reflected government priorities of improving the management of public accounts and assets,
and the performance of public enterprises, as well as strengthening fiscal policy management and donor
coordination. A number of these actions were linked to requirements of prior STP operations and aimed to
consolidate the pace of reforms. These prior actions were deemed necessary to achieve the program’s
objectives and strengthen the process of fiscal consolidation. More importantly, they were especially tailored to
STP taking into account the public sector’s weak institutional and managerial implementation capacity. The
prior actions are summarized in Table 1.

The operation was successful overall even though some related activities were temporarily delayed because
of presidential elections held on August 2011. Of the 10 monitoring indicators included in the operation, seven
were achieved; two substantially achieved with excellent prospects of becoming fully achieved; and one was
partly achieved by the operation’s closing date because of external factors outside the control of the authorities.
The Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) of February 2012 rated achievement of the program’s
objectives as Satisfactory. This was appropriate considering the progress achieved in complying with the
monitoring indicators’ requirements at the time the ISR was prepared. At the time the ICR was prepared,
additional progress had been achieved in complying with the monitoring indicators, with the Program’s
Development Objectives satisfactorily met.

The operation was successful in providing critical resources to implement the Government’s reform
program and close STP’s fiscal gap while helping maintain macroeconomic stability in 2011 at the time
of a global economic recession. In particular, the DPO provided a flow of external resources at a time
where other donor commitments had failed to materialize due to a deteriorating external environment.




                                                                  8
In terms of macroeconomic and fiscal performance, significant results were achieved by STP at end
2011. As shown in Table 3 below, steady progress was achieved in strengthening the performance of key
macroeconomic indicators. In particular, the authorities were able to: (i) reduce the domestic primary
deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP (from 9.1 percent in 2008), reflecting the impact of the fiscal consolidation
taking place; (ii) real GDP growth increased further to 4.9 percent despite a serious weakening of the
global economy; and (iii) inflation continued its downward trend to 12 percent at end-2011.

The operation was highly effective in strengthening the Government’s fiscal performance at a time
where external shocks were destabilizing fiscal accounts worldwide. The strengthening of capacity
achieved in the MIFC and related government agencies participating in the implementation of this
operation bodes well for the operations included in the First Programmatic DPO series. The operation’s
capacity strengthening experience will need to be broadened to include other institutions participating in
these new operations.

2.2     Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Several factors contributed to the successful implementation and outcome of the operation. These
factors are summarized into the following four sub-headings: (a) adequacy of government commitment;
(b) soundness of the background analysis; (c) quality at entry; and (d) risks identified at appraisal stage.

        (a) Adequacy of Government Commitment

Government commitment was very strong. Commitment to PFM reform was conveyed at the highest
levels of government, as noted in the Letter of Development Policy, with the endorsement of the Cabinet
as well as the National Assembly. The operation supported the continued implementation of STP’s 2010-
2014 Government Program and assisted in sustaining its achievements. It also contributed towards
advancing two key areas of STP’s concern: improving public resource management through greater
accountability and management of public expenditures, and promoting sustainable economic policies by
strengthening the fiscal and donor coordinating frameworks. In addition, the operation supported
government efforts to finalize a new participatorily prepared PRSP. The drive for reform had the support
of all political parties and of senior government officials. Therefore, the operation attained the broad
political and technical backing necessary to advance the country’s reform agenda. Those with
implementation responsibilities had already demonstrated commitment to achieve the objectives set out as
exemplified by the capacity gained in implementing prior World Bank DPOs and technical assistance
operations. Implementation of reforms was substantial despite capacity constraints and also despite the
occurrence of elections in 2011. Thus, adequacy of government commitment was assessed to be
Satisfactory.

        (b) Soundness of the Background Analysis

The background analysis underpinning the PRMG operation was comprehensive and responded to
country priorities as defined in PRSP I and in PRSP II, with the latter then under preparation.
Building on the achievements and lessons of previous Bank projects including the Public and Natural
Resource Management (PNMRD) DPO and the Capacity Building Technical Assistance (CBTA)
operation, the PRMG program supported consolidation of key reforms. Importantly, the PRMG program
built on the findings of Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR), the Public Expenditure and Financial Assessment (PEFA), the DeMPA, and the Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM), which was under preparation at the time of appraisal. Taken together,
these studies provided a strong analytical background for the operation’s design.

Analytical underpinnings and joint Bank-IMF staff assessments of the PRSP emphasized the need
for the poverty strategy to strengthen economic governance. The PRMG program particularly focused
on the PEMFAR, PEFA, and CEM findings that pro-poor expenditures have had a limited impact due to
sector strategies not being fully consistent with annual budget allocations and the long-term strategy set
out in the PRSP. Weak public financial management, including the lack of public accounts, had led to
inefficiency, limited control, and loss of impact of scarce public resources. Also, based on the priorities
set forth in the DeMPA dealing with fiscal policy, the PRMG program also supported reforms focusing
on strengthening debt and fiscal management, and on improving donor coordination. Soundness of the
background analysis was assessed to be Satisfactory.




                                                    11
        (c) Quality at Entry

Ensuring quality at entry was a key priority in project preparation. The PRMG operation supported
continuous progress on reforms spearheaded by previous Bank operations. It benefitted from the lessons
learned of the PNRMD DPO. The ICR for the PNRMD DPO emphasized that in a vulnerable country like
STP a long-term Bank commitment needs to be ensured, economic governance reforms need to be
consolidated, critical capacity constraints should be identified, technical complexities should not be
underestimated, and the monitoring and evaluation system needs to be simple. All these lessons were
fully addressed in the design of the operation.

Particular attention was given to the preparation of an institutional capacity assessment to ensure
that STP had sufficient capacity to be able to implement the proposed program. This assessment covered
all policy areas of the DPO, and calibrated effectively the mitigating actions needed to avoid the
operation’s derailment in the event that the risks identified at the appraisal stage were to materialize.
Special attention was given to assess whether the technical assistance provided under the CBTA operation
had been fully internalized in PFM operations given the CBTA operation’s key role in building blocks for
implementing the reform agenda. Significant emphasis was assigned to establishing a fiscal framework
needed to sustain the reform effort and also to implement the reform program under a situation of
uncertainty regarding the commercial development of the country’s oil resources. The process benefitted
from a strong working relationship with STP’s counterpart team, utilization of the PRSP consultation
process with civil society, and the full attention and support from the authorities at all levels.

        (d) Risks Identified at Appraisal Stage

Four risks were identified at appraisal, summarized as follows: (i) risk of maintaining a stable
macroeconomic environment should the expected external assistance not materialize or the global
recession continues; (ii) weak institutional capacity; (iii) delays in implementation due to changes in the
political sphere; and (iv) fiduciary risks. The risk analysis was fully relevant and the mitigation measures
proposed were clearly defined and adequate. The strength of government ownership and commitment to
implement the proposed measures in the area of fiscal consolidation and ensure their completion and
sustainability, together with the active and continuous Bank policy dialogue, have been fundamental
factors in mitigating the risks.

Risks were classified as substantial and moderate depending on the impact that they could have on
the implementation of the reform program. The substantial risks included the external factors; the
weak human, institutional, and managerial capacity; and political instability. The moderate risk included
the fiduciary risk. Of the four risks identified, the risk from external factors and the political risk
materialized. Nonetheless, the uncertain political environment only delayed temporarily the
implementation of reforms as political parties prepared for elections in mid-2011.

       There was a great concern that the external situation might deteriorate impacting adversely
        on STP’s economy. While the global recession has continued and some of the envisaged pro-
        poor external assistance did not materialize, the authorities were able to maintain a stable
        macroeconomic environment by ensuring strict discipline in their economic management and
        were able to largely weather the impact of the external shocks. They also reallocated funds from
        their own resources to ensure the maximum possible amount of pro-poor expenditures within the
        very tight limits of their financial capacity. Macroeconomic management performance was
        assessed to be Satisfactory (a summary of key macroeconomic indicators is included in Table 3).

       There was concern that institutional capacity might falter during the program’s
        implementation. Implementation capacity turned out to be adequate as a result of institutional

                                                    12
    capacity being well assessed and the assessment’s conclusions fully taken into account in the
    design phase. On the latter, the authorities had internalized the lessons from the prior GCBTA
    and PNMRD operations and formulated and implemented training programs to ensure that
    perceived weaknesses identified in the different activities of the program would be addressed.
    Implementation capacity management performance was assessed to be Satisfactory.

   There was also concern that presidential elections could derail implementation of the
    reform program. The political risk dealing with presidential elections in August 2011 was well
    known and it temporarily delayed implementation of the program. However, different from the
    experience of previous episodes in prior operations, these disruptions were not serious given the
    Government’s strong commitment to see the program go forward, together with the strong
    constituency that had developed to support the program. The program thus resumed its
    implementation once the after-effects of the election process had dissipated. More importantly,
    the authorities assigned a very high priority to catching up with the slippages originating from the
    electoral process. Political risk management performance was assessed to be Satisfactory.

   There was concern that fiduciary risks would materialize given that internal and external
    control mechanisms were perceived to be weak. Fiduciary risks did not materialize given the
    strong commitment to improve accountability, strengthen control mechanisms, and improving
    fiduciary standards. Financial management performance was assessed to be Satisfactory.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The program’s development objectives were clear and the focus of the different components was
well described, which helped in formulating appropriate indicators to follow up on the achievement of
the objectives.


                                                           14
    (a) Monitoring and Evaluation Design

The program document included a detailed development policy objective matrix that linked for each
of the operation’s objectives, on the basis of an identified baseline, the outcomes sought in line with the
strategy outcomes. Prior actions, key next steps, and expected results were clearly defined and easy to
monitor. The matrix was prepared jointly with STP’s counterpart team, helping ease the process whereby
M&E could gradually be institutionalized in the public sector. Monitoring indicators were carefully
crafted to be either directly linked to the prior actions or to those actions needed that would result
following implementation of the prior actions. M&E design was assessed to be Satisfactory.

    (b) Monitoring and Evaluation Implementation

The data and information on progress in achieving the monitoring indicators necessary for M&E
purposes were all official data collected at the MFIC, including information provided from the Ministry
of Planning, the National Statistical Institute, and the PRSP Unit. While in past operations in STP M&E
systems in the country were limited and delays had occurred during the collection of indicator data, the
documentation received for preparation of this ICR turned out to be timely, complete, and accurate. The
information was found to be reliable and was reconfirmed during individual meetings with the respective
agencies and departments. Gathering of the relevant information did not become a challenging or difficult
effort during the ICR preparation process. To a large extent, this recent experience points towards a
strengthening of institutional and managerial capacity in M&E activities. M&E implementation was
assessed to be Satisfactory.

    (c) Monitoring and Evaluation Utilization

The M&E system was based on relevant and easy to monitor indicators and program goals.
Although the Bank team has encouraged institutionalizing a M&E culture in the country, the impact of
such a dramatic change in oversight functions has been somewhat gradual for this operation. Yet, the
baseline information existed and performance indicators were easy to follow in their achievement to
better measure results over the medium term. To this end, in the last updating progress report provided by
the MFIC related to the performance indicators used for preparing this ICR, the M&E culture seems to
have begun to be internalized as reflected by the rapid and effective updating of the status of the
indicators. The improved M&E system enabled the authorities to act promptly to address delays
encountered.

Addressing M&E institutionalization efforts should not be viewed as a short term process. The
authorities are cognizant of this and such efforts are being continued in the context of the First
Governance and Competitiveness Development Policy Operation (DPO1), the first operation of a
programmatic DPO series for 2012-2014 (approved in March 2012) that followed the implementation of the
PRMG DPO and which supports economic governance and the improvement of the investment climate. It is
worth mentioning that in comparison to prior operations, the authorities appointed the MFIC Budget
Director as the focal point for M&E (for both the PRMG DPO and DPO1), with particular responsibilities to
update indicators on a regular basis. M&E utilization was assessed to be Satisfactory.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

Following the successful completion of two DPOs, STP’s Government requested a programmatic
series for 2012-2014. This programmatic DPO series is an integral part of the World Bank Group’s ISN.
It was approved in March 2012 and became effective in July 2012. The programmatic DPO series took
into account all areas included in the PRMG operation. Its objective is to assist STP to: (i) strengthen
economic governance, with a focus on improving the transparency and monitoring of public and natural

                                                    15
resources, improving the management and reporting of public finances, promoting fiscal stability, and
strengthening public debt management; and (ii) support broad-based growth by improving the business
climate, with a focus on simplifying business regulations and reducing the cost of trading across borders,
and by raising tourism prospects. The Bank will prepare a new CAS for FY2013-2016 and will build on
the lessons learned from both the PRMG DPO and the programmatic DPO series.




3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Overall Rating: Satisfactory

    (a) Objectives: Satisfactory

The program’s overall objectives were and remain relevant. The program’s development objectives,
namely, to assist the Government of STP to improve public sector effectiveness by raising the
transparency and accountability in the management of public resources and promoting sustainable
economic policies by strengthening the fiscal policy framework continue to be as relevant currently as
they were at the time of approval of the operation. These areas are reflected in the FY11-12 ISN, they are
priority areas of reforms in the programmatic DPO series, and are expected to be prominent in the new
CAS for 2013-2016. The PRMG DPO objectives reflect the importance of establishing a stable
macroeconomic environment and sustainable fiscal framework for growth, which is enunciated in both
the PRSP I and PRSP II and has been articulated in the Minister of MFIC statements to the National
Assembly in the 2011 and 2012 budgets. The operation’s objectives are consistent with STP’s reform
program’s objectives and with the Bank’s FY11-12 ISN, both of which recognize the importance of
sound macroeconomic and fiscal management to underpin economic and social development.

Progress to achieve the PDO was Satisfactory and the PDO was attained. The objectives were not
only met, but in some cases went beyond their original commitments to pave the way for further reforms.
    (b) Design: Satisfactory

The design of the operation was and remains relevant. The operation demanded actions appropriate
for achieving the objectives. On budget management, the operation supported measures to reform public
sector institutions according to their core functions and budget dependency. Particular importance was
assigned to ensure transparency and accountability in budget formulation and that pro-budget
expenditures were properly identified and monitored. The program included a number of reform actions
that global experience and STP-specific analytical work indicated were necessary to foster the pace of
fiscal consolidation.

The design of the reform program was largely based on a prior GCBTA operation and PEMFAR
and PEFA analytical work, areas identified in the PNMRD operation, and additional analytical work
being prepared by the Bank and STP’s authorities, such as the CEM and PRSP II, respectively. These
documents recognize the importance of sound PFM practices and of an effective public sector to sustain
longer term growth, poverty reduction, and improved social outcomes. The operation especially bolstered
PFM in the country by strengthening budget transparency and accountability, building up the
management of the Public Accounts of the State, improving the management of public assets, making
better the management of the Government’s payroll, improving the management of public enterprises;
strengthening fiscal management, bolstering donor coordination to improve the flow of external


                                                   16
resources, and preparing a results oriented development strategy for STP, PRSP II, which not only
includes monitorable indicators, but also maps out the next steps in its reform agenda. As a result, the
Government has significantly strengthened the efficiency and effectiveness of its core financial
institutions in the area of PFM.

The operation also introduced new analytical underpinnings, i.e., institutional and managerial
capacity assessment, the existence or non-existence of commercially viable oil production, and the need
to institutionalize a clear set of fiscal rules, i.e., a Fiscal Responsibility Framework, to improve the
Government’s implementation capabilities, strengthen macroeconomic management, and achieve and
maintain fiscal consolidation and long-term macroeconomic stability. Additionally, the operation
contributed to the design of the ISN, which was prepared in parallel, by provided a longer term view of
the economy and its developmental issues.

    (c) Implementation: Satisfactory

The implementation arrangements were relevant and continue to be so in the current context. The
MFIC was the executing agency because of its central role in managing the fiscal framework, in
determining the pace and scale of fiscal consolidation, and in coordinating policy within the Government.
The Budget Director was appropriately responsible for monitoring the implementation of the reform
program.

    (d) Monitoring and Evaluation: Satisfactory

Monitoring and evaluation activities were rated Satisfactory. The Government prepared a mid-term
progress report that was submitted to the Bank in November 2011. An Implementation Supervision
Report (ISR) was prepared in February 2012 which updated progress. A further update by the authorities
was submitted to the Bank in July 2012 and was utilized in the preparation of this ICR. While in the past
it had been difficult and lengthy at times to obtain indicator data from the program, such delays are not
considered to have been a source of risk for program implementation or for achieving its development
objectives and the authorities seem to have strengthened and improved their monitoring and evaluation as
evidenced by their July 2012 report.

(e) Program Management: Satisfactory

Program Management was Satisfactory. Program management was timely and facilitated substantial
progress in achieving the PDO. The program’s activities were followed closely by the Bank’s team, with
the team maintain continuous contact with its STP counterparts despite the fact that there is no Bank
office in STP.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Overall Rating: Satisfactory

The Program Development Objectives were achieved as evidenced by STP’s performance against
key quantitative and qualitative performance indicators. Details of the achievement of the PDO, by
policy area, are included below. In summary, substantial progress has been achieved in improving public
sector effectiveness, reflecting the country’s development priorities. The PRMG operation supported
seven prior actions and monitored achievement by 10 indicators. It focused on seven reform areas that
comprised the following: (i) increase the transparency and accountability of budget preparation so that the
budget reflects the priorities of the Government; (ii) improve the management of public accounts and
assets; (iii) improve payroll management; (iv) improve the performance of public enterprises; (v)

                                                    17
strengthen fiscal policy management; (vi) strengthen donor coordination; and (vii) prepare a results
oriented development strategy.

Regarding the operation’s achievement of its performance indicators, out of ten performance
indicators, seven were fully achieved and two were substantially achieved (with a compliance rate of
more than 70 percent) and with excellent prospects of being fully achieved by 2013. One indicator was
partly achieved (it was achieved at a 60 percent compliance rate) because of external factors out of the
control of the authorities arising from non-traditional donors not being able to deliver on their aid
commitments because of problems in the global economy that had impaired their capacity to honor them.
Nonetheless, on this indicator, the Government showed a high level of commitment as evidence by a high
execution rate of pro-poor expenditures that depended on internal resources. All in all, the specified
shortcomings in the achievement of some target indicators are minor.

    (a) Objective: Assist the Government to Improve Public Sector Effectiveness – Satisfactory

       1. Improve the transparency of the budget – Highly Satisfactory

Transparency of budget preparation has increased notably. The 2011 Budget Proposal, the 2011
approved Budget Law, and the 2011 Quarterly Budget Implementation Reports for March, June, and
September have been published in the Government’s website. In addition, the Government has also
published the 2012 Budget Proposal and the approved 2012 Budget Law in its website. In addition, the
content of the budget documents has improved with the inclusion of more detailed information on budget
execution.

       2. Improve the accountability of budget preparation so that the budget reflects the priorities of
        the Government – Satisfactory
Budget accountability improved as pro-poor budget codes were included in the budget documents
for the first time. The 2011 Budget Law allocated Db 1,206 billion for pro-poor expenditures, to be
financed by both external and internal sources, of which over 80 percent were to originate from donor
financing. At end-December 2011, Db 414 billion had been executed, representing 34 percent of pro-poor
expenditures. Implementation delays emerged because donor financing for pro-poor expenditures did not
materialize for reasons outside of the control of the Government. More specifically, the budget target was
not feasible given that pro-poor expenditures (as specified in the Budget Law) were largely dependent on
commitments from non-traditional donors that did not materialize because of changes in the global
economy that affected them. Nonetheless, concerning those pro-poor expenditures that were to be
financed from internal sources in 2011, the execution rate was 94 percent. The target de "internally-
funded pro-poor expenditures" is the most adequate to be utilized in the ICR. The case of pro-poor
expenditures is quite similar to the assessment of macro-fiscal policy, which focuses on "domestic
primary fiscal deficit" and not on the overall fiscal deficit, since the Government only has control over the
domestic primary fiscal deficit. In a similar vein, because the Government only has control over the
internally-funded pro-poor expenditures, this is a better target to assess the achievement of the PDO.
Furthermore, what has now become highly relevant as a result of the operation is the fact that pro-poor
expenditures are being monitored. All in all, the fact that pro-poor expenditures are being tracked in the
budget and the fact that the executed rate of pro-poor expenditures financed with internal resources was
94 percent reflects a strong Government commitment. Notably, the PRMG DPO funds, which were
disbursed in October 2011, were used to achieve the 94 percent execution rate of pro-poor expenditures.

It is also important to note that the budgeted amount for pro-poor expenditures in 2011 was equivalent to
over 30 percent of GDP, which is very high (the pro-poor expenditures that were executed represented
more than 10 percent of GDP in 2011). This is a structural issue concerning challenges in budgetary

                                                     18
predictions in an aid-dependent small island nation. In this context, the Government is working closely
with development partners to improve, over the medium-term, the quality of pro-poor budget codes, and
more importantly, to improve the system of budget preparation, implementation, and supervision, by
reviewing the realism of budgetary assumptions, preparing mid-year budget reviews, and issuing
supplementary budgets.

       3. Improve the management of public accounts – Highly Satisfactory
The management of public accounts was strengthened and public accounting statistics were
produced for the first time since 1992. Public accounting statistics were produced for 2010 and 2011.
These include financial statistics and statistics on budget execution, which are the basis for the
preparation of the Public Accounts of the State. In addition, an action plan for the preparation of the
public accounts of the State is in place. A Decree establishing the contents of the Public Accounts of the
State that also includes a calendar for their preparation and submission to the Court of Accounts has been
sanctioned. A manual of public accounting has been prepared. Draft Public Accounts of the State for 2010
have been completed and will be submitted to the Court of Accounts for auditing.

       4. Improve the management of public assets – Satisfactory

The management of public assets was also strengthened. The inventory and database of mobile public
assets for all ministerial entities has been updated up to December 2011. In addition, the authorities also
created a database of semi-mobile assets (automobiles). The manual of public assets was disseminated to
all ministerial entities in June 2011. Although the database on mobile public assets has been updated, and
a database on semi-mobile public assets has been created, these databases have not yet been published in
the Government’s website because of insufficient IT expertise to do it, given difficulties in transferring
the database between two separate computer languages (Access to Oracle). Once the latter is completed in
2013, the updated information on public assets will be published. In addition, the Government has
initiated a medium-term capacity building program to train staff in the Public Assets Directorate while
guidelines for the management of public assets have been operationalized.

       5. Improve payroll management – Satisfactory
Payroll management has been improved by integrating the payroll management system into the
SAFE-e system. A census of government employees (which is the basis for the payroll system) has been
completed, and a single database with information on all government employees was created. In addition,
the SAFE-e system contains a module on human resources and wage management. The SAFE-e system
now links operations in the treasury, budget, and public accounts. Even though there were delays in
completing and launching the sophisticated SAFE-e software system, the SAFE-e system became
operational in March 2012. The system is being improved; pilot testing is expected to be completed in
2012. The MFIC will process the public sector wage bill through the SAFE-e system as it becomes fully
operational.

       6. Improve the performance of public enterprises – Satisfactory
Clear managerial structures were set for better administrative and financial controls of public
enterprises and the authorities improved the oversight of public enterprises. With support from the
PRMG DPO, the authorities updated the legislative framework (which dated from 1978), setting procedures
and managerial structures concerning the SOEs internal organization, financial monitoring and controls, and
financing, as well as private sector participation. This legislation provided the framework for conducting
results-based performance assessments and for remunerating executives through performance bonuses.
Following the approval of the legal framework for evaluating public enterprises, the Government
completed a diagnosis study of the financial practices of two SOEs, namely EMAE (the electricity and

                                                    19
water company) and ENAPORT (the port and transport company). Furthermore, the EMAE study was
updated in the first half of 2012 after taking into account comments received from the SOE, and was
published in the Government’s website, thereby raising public sector transparency. In the medium-term,
the authorities will prepare diagnosis studies of the financial practices of the remaining SOEs (Correos-
postal services, ENASA-airport, and INAC-the national institute of civil aviation).

       7. Strengthen fiscal policy management (Public Debt) – Highly Satisfactory
Debt management has been strengthened. With the support from the PRMG DPO, the Government
submitted to the National Assembly a bill that would set clear managerial structures for debt-related
transactions. The draft legislation provided a strong mandate for ensuring that new public debt contracted
could only be approved by MFIC and would also require National Assembly endorsement. Furthermore, it
provided clear managerial structures for contracting public debt by only allowing MFIC to manage public debt
decisions, as well as regulations of loan guarantees for all public entities. Following the improvement of the
legal framework governing debt management, the government published a comprehensive report with
information on all outstanding public debt as of December 2011, and submitted it to the National
Assembly. All new public debt has been signed by the MFIC Minister. The Public Debt Management
Law was approved by the National Assembly in 2012.

       8. Strengthen fiscal policy management (Fiscal Responsibility Framework)– Satisfactory

The MFIC completed an assessment of STP’s fiscal policy management system with support from the
IMF and the World Bank. This assessment includes an action plan to improve the Government’s Fiscal
Responsibility Framework. For example, the authorities improved substantially the content of the budget
documents which now include historical information on budget execution and public debt. Furthermore,
the Government substantially reduced public sector arrears owed to the utility company EMAE, and
prepared an action plan to further reduce public sector arrears over the medium-term. Upon World Bank
and IMF recommendations, the authorities have implemented recommendations of the Fiscal Policy
Assessment before making legal changes in the existing laws, with the intention of building capacity in
the MFIC before any legal framework is formally approved. A Fiscal Responsibility Framework is
expected to be discussed with stakeholders in 2013.

       9. Strengthen donor coordination – Satisfactory

Donor coordination has been strengthened and aid effectiveness has been raised through
improvements in the coordination mechanism. To this end, the Government prepared a database on
external assistance with information on donor-funded projects, which it will update and monitor on a
regular basis. STP also held its first ever Donor Roundtable on December 12, 2011to improve aid
harmonization and effectiveness and to update the database on external assistance.

       10. Prepare a results oriented development strategy – Satisfactory

A new development strategy, PRSP II, has been approved and published. The Government approved
the new PRSP II for the period 2012-2016 and sent it to the National Assembly for information in March
2012. The PRSP II was prepared in a participatory manner and discussed with key stakeholders including
the private sector and civil society. The new PRSP II incorporates a new growth diversification strategy,
particularly focusing on the need to raise the country’s level of economic growth and of employment
creation. The new development strategy is results oriented and includes monitorable indicators. It was
submitted to the World Bank and IMF in March 2012. A preliminary poverty profile based on 2010
household survey data was included in the PRSP II. The updated poverty profile will help the authorities


                                                     20
establish a closer link between the PRSP’s objectives and those of the MDGs, thereby strengthening the
monitoring and assessment mechanisms of STP’s new development strategy.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The operation achieved the PDO as set at appraisal. The operation objectives, design, and
implementation arrangements were (and continue to be) fully relevant. The PDO was met as evidenced by
progress achieved in raising the transparency and accountability in the management of public resources
and promoting sustainable economic policies. Key indicators were met for a majority of outcomes. All in
all, significant progress has been achieved, with seven out of ten targets met, substantial progress
achieved in meeting the target of two others, and progress achieved in a remaining one even with the
occurrence of external factors beyond the control of the authorities. Shortcomings in the achievement of
the target indicators were assessed to be minor. Once all these factors are considered, the overall outcome
is rated Satisfactory.

The overall Satisfactory rating is also based on consideration to the risks related to the continuity of
the reform program towards the operation’s medium term development outcomes. Reforms across
all policy areas supported by the PRMG DPO have continued, supported by a new programmatic DPO.
The PRSP II also supports the broadening of reforms across all policy areas of the PRMG DPO.

3.4 Efficiency

Not applicable.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

  (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Three components of this operation are expected to have had a positive impact on poverty reduction,
gender aspects, and social development. The first one refers to the budget, which has become more
transparent and accountable to reflect the priorities of the Government. The budget now specifies pro-poor
expenditures, which is raising public awareness on social development aspects. The second one refers to
strengthening donor coordination, which can now be focused more effectively and efficiently on poverty
reduction, gender aspects, and social development. The third one refers to supporting preparation of a
results oriented development strategy, which targets the vulnerable groups. Supported by this operation,
PRSP II was completed. Successful implementation of its components will have strengthened the
authorities’ capacity to support social, gender related, and poverty reduction programs as they are
incorporated into the budget.

  (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional strengthening supported by the PRMG program has been significant. These have
mainly benefitted the MFIC, particularly the Budget Department, Treasury Directorate, Public
Accounting Directorate, the Directorate of Public Assets Management, the Directorate of International
Cooperation, and also benefited particular agencies in the Ministry of Planning. The institutional changes
taking place are expected to support the implementation of the PRSP II.

The capacity of the MFIC for budget formulation has improved substantially. The budget has
become better aligned to the Government’s strategy and priorities, particularly those related to poverty

                                                    21
reduction and to the social sectors. Transparency and accountability of public expenditures has been
strengthened. The PRMG operation supported the introduction of a software system and budget codes that
helped quantify the amounts of poverty and social development related expenditures by linking budgetary
codes to PRSP objectives. Putting into operation the SAFE-e system will speed-up preparation of annual
financial statements of the State. In addition, the recently-created inventory of mobile public assets
provides critical information needed to prepare the public accounts of the State.

The capacity of the MFIC to improve payroll management, improve the oversight of public
enterprises, and improve fiscal policy management has also been increased substantially. First,
payroll management will be strengthened with the centralization of all personnel in one database. Second,
clear managerial structures for better administrative and financial controls will now be set. Finally, fiscal
policy management has been strengthened which will help the authorities to avoid pro-cyclicality in fiscal
policy and make the budget process more hierarchical by providing procedural rules to guarantee fiscal
compliance and avoid misuse of political discretion in budgetary allocation and execution. Equally
important, debt management reforms have provided the MFIC with clear managerial structures for
contracting public debt (by only allowing MFIC to manage public debt decisions), as well as regulations
of loan guarantees for all public entities.

The capacity of the MFIC to coordinate with donors has also improved. The single database of
external assistance will ensure that donor-financed projects are adequately registered ((i.e., planned
results, actual results, commitments, disbursement, and where possible, pipeline projects and
expenditures).

   (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

There were no unintended consequences.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

There were no beneficiary survey and/or stakeholder workshop.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Overall Rating: Moderate

The risk of maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment should the expected external
assistance not materialize or if the global recession continues is moderate. There is a risk of external
shocks associated with the uncertainties in the global environment; and STP’s economy remains highly
vulnerable to these shocks because of its high dependence on imports, tourism, and external inflows. At
the time of appraisal it was envisaged that external factors could probably weaken the pace of reforms,
but not necessarily the sustainability of the Government’s efforts and thus of the development outcome.
For instance, a prolonged international recession or a recurrence of rising oil and food prices could have
weakened STP’s economy, increased inflationary pressures, affected fiscal performance, and delayed
gains in reducing poverty. Yet, in comparison to 2008, STP has a healthier fiscal balance and has been
adopting the policies that are necessary to maintain it. The arrival of new oil signature bonuses has also
improved the balance of the National Oil Account, giving the authorities more fiscal space to address
shocks. Although the expected pro-poor external assistance in 2011 did not materialize and the global
recession continued, STP was able to weather the deteriorating external climate as a result of the above
factors, and maintain a stable macroeconomic environment.

                                                     22
Within the context of withstanding further external shocks, the Government’s commitment to
consolidate the PFM reform program and implement PRSP II fortifies the economy’s resilience to
potential external shocks. Also reassuring is the fact that Government efforts are being complemented
with the continued implementation of a recently approved IMF-ECF program for 2012-2015 which will
promote macroeconomic stability. At the same time, continuous external support to STP’s fiscal
consolidation and effective implementation of PRSP II is a critical and necessary element needed to avoid
slippages in the reform agenda in a highly uncertain and convoluted external environment. Therefore,
given the positive prior experience, this assessment stands also for the future.

The risk of moving away from the direction of policies is low. The Government, through the
continuous support of the Bank, has been raising the transparency and accountability in the management
of public resources and promoting sustainable economic policies by strengthening the fiscal framework.
The Government is committed to further continue to strengthen STP’s policy and institutional base for
sustained growth and poverty reduction. These efforts have been demonstrated by its strong ownership of
the reform program. Moreover, its commitment to sustaining the reform effort has been intensified as
evidenced by last year’s request for a First Programmatic DPL Series and a successful performance under
the IMF ECF. Although implementation capacity in the public sector is viewed to be particularly weak in
terms of institutions and management, requiring much strengthening, the extensive experience
accumulated through successive operations in the area of PFM has signaled that the pace of
implementation of the PRMG operation’s policies will be maintained. Institutional capacity is also
intended to be strengthened with the training programs being introduced, which bodes well for the
sustainability of the process of institutionalizing the reforms over the medium term.

The risk of experiencing delays in the implementation of the program due to limited capacity or
changes in the political sphere is moderate. Although there is a high level of commitment of all
political parties around the PRMG operation’s supported reforms and of the continuous support from the
Bank, the assessment of the risk to the development outcome is moderate. While political risks could
materialize in the future, it is likely that the program’s objectives will be achieved and sustained over the
medium term given the existing political consensus that the reforms are necessary. In this regard, given
recent experience related to presidential elections held in 2011, pointed to the fact that the implementation
of reforms would be maintained even though they might be delayed. The Government has continued to
maintain its focus and priority on public sector effectiveness and has requested further support from the
Bank in the area of public sector effectiveness through a First Programmatic DPO Series, which supports
the policy areas of the PRMG DPO. This reinforces the view that both the Government and the country
are behind the reform program.



5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

  (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance in the identification of the operation was Satisfactory. Areas supported were
identifies based on analytical underpinnings and on lessons learned from previous operations. Priorities
were jointly identified with the authorities, and were highlighted in the ISN. The Bank team focused on

                                                     23
high priority PFM areas that would support the ongoing process of fiscal consolidation and at the same
time lead to a substantial impact in improving transparency and accountability. Coordination with the
IMF was highly effective to ensure that Bank and IMF programs were mutually reinforcing.

Bank performance in the preparation of the operation was Satisfactory. As mentioned above, the
design of the reform program was largely based on a prior GCBTA operation and PEMFAR and PEFA
analytical work, areas identified in the PNMRD operation, and additional analytical work being prepared
by the Bank and STP’s authorities, such as the CEM and PRSP II, respectively. However, it also included
new areas that warranted significant attention to ensure a successful fiscal consolidation such as the need
for a Fiscal Responsibility Framework. The operation also emphasized the need to undertake an
institutional capacity assessment. The later enabled the identification of areas where the reform program
could be successfully implemented while helping lay out the groundwork for the identification of a
medium term framework for further fiscal consolidation and PFM reform, particularly for the upcoming
programmatic DPO series. Finally, the operation also took into account the possibility that oil production
might or might not become a commercially viable enterprise because of the high costs involved in deep
water extraction. Continuous policy dialogue with the authorities underpinned the operation’s preparation
effort.

Bank performance in the appraisal of the operation was Satisfactory. The Bank team assigned special
attention to the potential risks that could be faced during implementation of the PRMG operation, brought
them to the attention of the authorities, and raised them in a fairly straightforward manner in the project
document. The team worked very closely with its STP’s counterparts to identify adequate mitigation
measures in case that the risks foreseen were to materialize, and ensured proper coordination with the
IMF. These joint efforts eventually led to very high dividends.

  (b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Bank performance in the supervision of the operation was Highly Satisfactory. Supervision of the
operation was fully adequate. In addition to regular meetings held virtually between Bank staff and the
Government, two supervision missions were undertaken, both as part of preparation missions for the first
operation in the programmatic DPO series. The Bank’s team fully engaged the authorities in following up
on implementation of reforms established in the project document and also discussed further reforms
needed for consolidating the public finances and establishing a solid basis for sustaining growth. An
important aspect of managing the supervision of the operation had to do with the planning and timing of
the missions. The first one took place on November 2011, a few months after the presidential elections
and the second one on early February 2012, prior to the operation’s closing date. Both activities proved to
be instrumental in contributing to strengthening the authorities’ refocus efforts on implementing the
reform agenda. Given the excellent working relationship between the Bank’s team and its STP
counterpart’s team, the supervisory work was undertaken efficiently in an environment of mutual trust.

    (a) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance is rated Satisfactory on the basis of its overall efforts in ensuring quality at entry
and on progress in implementing the reform agenda at supervision. The Bank team responded rapidly and
effectively to the authorities’ request for support to its reform program at a time of great uncertainty in the
country’s external environment and in the context of a very challenging political environment. The Bank
maintained high quality standards at all times in the design and implementation of the operation providing

                                                      24
additional support through its analytical work and policy recommendations. In particular, it maintained a
continuous and supporting dialogue throughout its supervision activities in order to buttress the country’s
reform efforts.

5.2 Borrower Performance

    (a) Government Performance/ Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance/ Overall
        Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Borrower performance is rated Satisfactory. For the purpose of this review, Government performance
and implementing agency performance are considered the same. Therefore, the above rating above should
be viewed as an overall rating for the borrower. The MFIC was the coordinating entity for the reform
program and responsible agency for the management of the reforms. Several MFIC units were involved in
the reform process.

Commitment to reform was very strong. The MFIC Minister led the reform efforts. The authorities
were fully involved in the design of this operation which was based on the Government’s new PRSP
priority agenda and the analytical work undertaken by the Bank. An important aspect of the authorities’
success in implementing its reform agenda relates to effective dissemination of its agenda as part of its
PRSP program, as well as to the very intensive consultations undertaken with civil society.

Government effectiveness was strong. The achievement of almost all the monitoring indicators in 2012
despite the country’s limited capacity and the fact that the country went through a 2011 Presidential
election shows a high degree of government effectiveness. The authorities also achieved substantial
progress in implementing the IMF-CEF, fulfilling all quantitative targets under the program. In addition,
the authorities made effective use of development partners to support the reform agenda.



6. Lessons Learned
The key lessons learned from this program pertain to: (i) continued attention needs to be paid to
changes in the external environment in all new operations; (ii) effective supervision will contribute to
maintain the implementation pace of a reform program; (iii) an adequate institutional capacity building
assessment is a key and necessary element for ensuring quality at entry; and (iv) continued emphasis on
building an M&E culture will contribute to maintaining the implementation of an operation’s
commitments on track. These lessons are being reflected in arrangements for follow-up operations. They
also have general applicability for similar operations in small island countries.

       Continued attention needs to be paid to changes in the external environment in all new
        operations. Small island states are highly vulnerable to external shocks, the changing external
        environment, and also highly dependent on imports. Since major uncertainties regarding how
        long the current global recession will last and on the adverse impact of changing weather on
        world production and prices of staple foods remain, a new wave of external shocks should not be
        ruled out, particularly given the rise in the international price of a number of commodities
        following climatic changes that are likely to affect world food production. Therefore country
        strategies and new operations for small fragile states should always take into account that a
        worsening scenario is likely to develop and should propose both policies and a financing scenario


                                                    25
        that would take into account such eventualities. In this connection, having in place a Fiscal
        Responsibility Framework will contribute to ameliorate the impact of external shocks from
        destabilizing a country’s macroeconomic management.

       Effective supervision will contribute to maintain the implementation pace of a reform
        program, particularly in countries with limited institutional capacity. Undertaking
        supervision activities following electoral processes that temporarily delay implementation of the
        reform agenda proves to be highly warranted since the work of a mission can contribute to actions
        that will bring a program back on track. Also, undertaking supervision activities prior to an
        operation’s closing date can help speed-up completion of the reform agenda. Nonetheless, DPOs
        are not privy to a supervision budget, thus putting at risk adequate implementation of a reform
        agenda. Since in many instances supervision activities have to piggy-back project preparation
        activities when such preparation activities are scheduled to be undertaken, proposals for new
        operations should be required to include the details of its supervision program and budget at
        inception.

       An adequate institutional capacity building assessment is a key and necessary element for
        ensuring quality at entry. An institutional capacity assessment will help identify a country
        client’s strengths and weaknesses in implementing a reform program and thus alert the project
        team on a timely basis of the corrective actions required, of which development of training
        programs would be a key priority. It is therefore imperative that the assessment made on a
        prospective operation be able to focus on the clients’ institutional and managerial capacity to
        implement it effectively, thus avoiding potential delays originating from capacity constraints.

       Continued emphasis on building an M&E culture will contribute to maintaining the
        implementation of an operation’s commitments on track. At times it has been difficult and
        lengthy to obtain indicator data that is absolutely necessary to ensure that corrective actions are
        introduced on a timely basis to ensure that a program’s objectives remain on track. Emphasis on
        M&E is even more warranted when there are disruptions occasioned by external shocks or
        political developments. Simple monitoring indicators are key to developing an M&E culture,
        coupled with an effective outreach.

         Draft Implementation Completion and Results Report dated August 6, 2012


1.      Implementation of the Budget Support Operation
In view of major public financial management reforms being undertaken by the government of the
Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe since the second half of the 2000s, our authorities have been
working closely with the World Bank to ensure that the desired effects of the policy actions in the PRMG DPO
are achieved. These measures are aimed at positioning our country on a development path through a
sustainable macroeconomic environment. We continue to pursue the policy objective set out in the DPO,
improve public sector effectiveness, and we are committed to raising transparency and accountability in
the management of public resources, and to promoting sustainable economic policies.

2.      The Reforms

2.1     Improve the Transparency and Accountability of the Budget

Results of the Reforms
Our government has increased the transparency of the public budget, and has published the budget
documents, including the budget proposal and the Budget Law for 2011, as well as the in-year budget
reports. Furthermore, we have published the 2012 budget proposal and Budget Law. Our government has
also raised budget accountability by including pro-poor budget codes in budget documents for the first
time. The 2011 Budget Law allocated Db 1,206 billion for pro-poor expenditures, of which over 80
percent was to be financed by donors. However, the financing did not materialize for reasons beyond our
control. Nonetheless, the execution rate on pro-poor expenditures financed from internal sources was 94
percent. The fact that we are tracking pro-poor expenditures and that their executed rate was high reflects
our strong commitment to reducing poverty.

Remaining Challenges
Achieving an execution rate of at least 90 percent of pro-poor expenditures in the 2012 and 2013 budgets.

2.2     Improve the Management of Public Accounts and Assets

Results of the Reforms
Our government strengthened the management of public accounts and produced accounting statistics in
2010 and 2011 for the first time since 1992, including those necessary for preparing the Public Accounts
of the State. We also put in place an action plan for their preparation, sanctioned a Decree establishing the
contents of the Public Accounts of the State, and prepared a manual of public accounting. In addition, we
strengthened public assets management by updating the inventory and database of mobile public assets
for all ministries, created a database of semi-mobile assets, and disseminated the manual of public assets.
We plan to publish the information on public assets as soon as the related computer work is completed.



                                                     28
Remaining Challenges
Implementing the action plan for preparing the public accounts of the State and submitting them to the
Court of Accounts, and publishing the updated information on public assets.

2.3     Improve payroll management

Results of the Reforms
Our government improved payroll management by integrating the payroll management system into the
SAFE-e system. We successfully completed a census of government employees, and created a single
database with information on all government employees. In addition, the SAFE-e system contains a
module on human resources and wage management.

Remaining Challenges
Processing the public sector wage bill through the SAFE-e system as it becomes fully
operational.

2.4     Improve the Oversight of Public Enterprises

Results of the Reforms
Our government set clear managerial structures for better administrative and financial controls of SOEs
and improved their oversight. Following the approval of the legal framework for evaluating public
enterprises, our government completed a diagnosis study of the financial practices of two SOEs, namely
EMAE (the electricity and water company) and ENAPORT (the port and transport company). The EMAE
study was updated in the first half of 2012 and it was published, thereby raising public sector
transparency.

Remaining Challenges
Preparing diagnosis studies of financial practices for the remaining SOEs.

2.5     Strengthen Fiscal Policy Management

Results of the Reforms
Our government strengthened fiscal policy management. Following the improvement of the legal
framework governing debt management, we published a comprehensive report, including all outstanding
public debt as of December 2011 and submitted it to the National Assembly, with all new public debt
signed by our Minister of Finance and International Cooperation. The Public Debt Management Law was
approved by the National Assembly in 2012. We completed a fiscal policy management system
assessment, with an action plan to improve the Fiscal Responsibility Framework. To this end, we
improved the content of the budget documents that now includes historical information on budget
execution and public debt, reduced public sector arrears to EMAE. We remain committed to further
reducing public sector arrears and implementing the recommendations of the Fiscal Policy Assessment
before making legal changes in the existing laws.

Remaining Challenges
Discussing a Fiscal Responsibility Framework with stakeholders in 2013.




                                                   29
2.6     Strengthen donor coordination

Results of the Reforms
Our government strengthened donor coordination and raised aid effectiveness by improving the
coordination mechanism. In particular, we prepared a database on external assistance with information on
donor-funded projects, which we will update and monitor on a regular basis. We also held our first Donor
Roundtable to improve aid harmonization and effectiveness and update the database.

Remaining Challenges
Continuing holding Donor Roundtables and updating of the database on external assistance.

2.7     Prepare a Results-Oriented Development Strategy

Results of the Reforms
Our government approved a new development strategy for 2012-2016 (PRSP II) and sent it to the
National Assembly for information. The PRSP II was prepared in a participatory manner and discussed
with key stakeholders (the private sector and civil society). Our strategy focuses on raising economic
growth and employment creation that is results oriented and includes monitorable indicators. Our strategy
includes a preliminary poverty profile based on 2010 household survey data, which will help us establish
a closer link between its objectives and those of the MDGs.

Remaining Challenges
Implementing PRSP II on a timely basis.

3. The Bank’s Performance at Appraisal
We wish to acknowledge the Bank’s assistance towards the achievement of our reform program. Bank
staff provided significant guidance and advice in the areas that the DPO focused on, and beyond. In
particular, we wish to acknowledge the Bank’s contributions and guidance on improving the transparency
of the budget, strengthening fiscal policy, and preparing the public accounts of the State.

4. Conclusion
Our government agrees with the evaluation set forth in the Implementation Completion and Results report
of the PRMG DPO, and note that our authorities maintained the conditions set out for disbursement of
this operation. This resulted from our determination and continued commitment towards achieving the
aims of the operation, as well as of the assistance and support provided by the Bank. Our government
recognizes the importance of sustainability and long-term macroeconomic viability, and wishes to express its
gratitude to the World Bank for the DPO, which helped achieve these goals. In view of our success in meeting
the above mentioned development challenges, in 2011 our government requested a First Programmatic DPO
series for 2012-2014. The programmatic DPO series took into account all areas included in the PRMG
operation.
