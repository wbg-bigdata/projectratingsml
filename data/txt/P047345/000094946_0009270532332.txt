Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                          Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Environmental Assessment of the Huai River Water Pollution Control Project (HRWPCP),
Shandong Province
This report provides a summary of the Environmental Assessment Report - Main Report and
Appendices, for the Shandong Province portion of the Huai River Water Pollution Control Project
(HRWPCP). A separate Environmental Assessment Report covers the Anhui Province portion of the
HRWPCP. The full reports cover the assessment of the environment impacts of the project
components to be developed under the HRWPCP, Shandong Province. The Provincial EA for
Shandong Province was conducted by the Shandong Scientific Research and Design Institute of
Environmental Protection (SIEP), under the Shandong Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau
(EPB) in Jinan, with the assistance of the AC (Mott MacDonald and ERM International).
Huai River Basin
The Huai River Basin lies across four provinces in the centre of China, covering an area of 270,000
km2 between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. The Basin is divided into two major. systems: The Huai
River System (190,000 kM2) originating in the west and about 1,000 km long with 120 tributaries
'lows east-south through Hongze Lake and discharges into the Yangtze River. The Yi-Shu-Si River
System (80,000 kmi2) originates in the north, flows southwest and discharges into the Yellow Sea.
The Grand Canal in the east connects the Huai and Yi-Shu-Si systems as well as the Yangtze and
Yellow rivers. Shandong Province surface reaches are hyrologically connected to the Huai River
basin through the Grand Canal, but they do not flow directly to the Huai River mainstream.
The economic and environmental impacts of water pollution on the Huai River Basin area are
widespread and acute. In 1994, severe water pollution caused temporary production stoppage at many
factories and drinking water problems for many inhabitants in the Huai River Basin. The cause of the
1994 Huai River Pollution Incident was discharge of significant polluted wastewater from many straw
pulp factories, paper mills, and tanneries in Henan Province and Anhui Province located the upstream
portion of the Ying He River. These industries discharged a great quantity of polluted wastewater
during the dry season when the River course operates with closed gates. (Since 60-70 % of the annual
river flow occurs during May-August time period, the gates maintain surface water levels but also
store the incoming pollution.) This stored polluted wastewater discharged during the flood season
when the gates opened, resulting in significant downstream pollution. The pollution caused the power
station to malfunction causing major impacts to the Hua Dong power network. Fishery resources
were destroyed and agricultural and industrial damages were widespread. Water supplies were all
affected resulting in significant impacts to the people of the downstream cities. Direct economic
damages were estimated at over one billion yuan.
Consequently the State Council has authorised various actions to combat water pollution and prevent
future pollution disasters in the Huai River Basin. The central government approved the "Ninth Five-
Year Plan (1996-2000) of Water Pollution Control (WPCP) in June of 1996. The WPCP for the Huai
River Basin defined the targets for the Basin as follows:
*   By 1997, all the wastewater discharges from industrial pollution sources should meet
standards for effluent and the total COD should be reduced from 1.5 million tons in 1993 to
0.89 million tons (0.2638 million tons from Shandong Province.);

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                             Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
*   By 2000, the total COD should be reduced to 0.368 million tons (0.0647 million tons from
Shandong Province.);
*   By 2000, the Huai River mainstream, main tributaries, and rivers that are sources for urban
water supplies, should reach the Class III of the National Surface Water Standard.
As part of these efforts of the State Council and the four Huai basin provinces (i.e. Henan, Anhui,
Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces) to meet water pollution control targets, the Huai River Water
Pollution Control Project (HRWPCP) is currently being prepared for Anhui and Shandong Provinces.
At the request of PRC, the World Bank has listed the proposed project in the lending programme for
WB fiscal year 2000/2001. Water pollution control in Henan and Jiangsu is being dealt with under a
separate programme.
Shandong Province
Shandong Province covers most area of Yi-Shu-Si System of Huai River Basin. The mainstream of
the Huai River does not flow through the Province, but many other basin tributary reaches flow
through the Province. Many are hydrologically connected to the Huai River but actually flow directly
to-the Yellow Sea. Pollution is mainly organic, with sections in urban reaches being more polluted
than rural reaches.
By December 1996 to control pollution in the Basin and in accordance with stipulation of "Ninth Five-
Year Plan," the province had closed approximately 460 small enterprises causing serious pollution.
Other small and medium polluting enterprises have continued to be closed in the basin, and other
polluting enterprises have their production curtailed in the dry season to reduce wastewater discharges.
Within the overall HRWPCP project area, Shandong Province is approximately 156,700 kM2, of
which 47,100 km2 is located within the Huai River Basin. The 1998 population of the Shandong
Province was 86.10 million, with 23 million in urban areas. The portion of Shandong Province within
the Huai River Basin was about 30 million total, and 1.2 million in urban areas.
HRWPCP Project Goals and Objectives
In order to fully solve the pollution problems in Shandong province major works will need to be
developed for most of the cities in the province. It is not possible to finance all necessary works in one
step. It is therefore foreseen that further phases of the HIRWPCP will continue over many years.
In accordance with the national World Bank (WB) policies and priorities, the Shandong Provincial
Government (SPG) has requested WB and bi-lateral donor support for the Huai River Water Pollution
Control Project. The HRWPCP is also a key element of China's Agenda 21 programme. The sector-
related goal for the project is:
Improve quality of water for the entire basin by providing environnenital
infrastructure operated in a sustainable manner
The HRWPCP objectives are to:
I. Upgrade water quality in the Huai River (Class III target) and its tributaries (Class IV
target) within the two provinces.

2. Establish performing and efficient wastewater agencies.
3. Consolidate water quality monitoring system and procedures.
To accomplish this goal and objectives, the outputs for each project component are:
1. Increase in municipal wastewater collection.
2. Increase in quantity of wastewater treatment.
3. Implementation of cost-recovery for wastewater operations.
Regional Water Resources
The Huai River mainstream originates from Mt.Tongbo in Tongbo County, Henan Province. It flows
through Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu from west to east and the mainstream covers 1000 km. The
elevation difference is 13m with a ratio of 0.03%.
Shandong Province is located in the middle and downstream of Huai River. Within the boundary, the
basin area is 47,100 km2, or 30.06 % of the total area. Shandong Huai River Basin covers the cities of
Zaozhuang, Jining, Linyi, Taian, and Zibo and the prefecture of Heze.
The surface water is mainly polluted by COD, BOD, organisms and unionised ammonia. After the
implementation of the 1996 WPCP, the water quality is improving. However, the planned water
,uality objective of "Huai River Basin Water Pollution Protection and Control Plan" and "Ninth-five
years' Plan (1996-2000) has not been attained. No rivers in Shandong Province are tributaries of the
Huai River mainstream directly. The Huai River mainstream and the Yi-Shu-Si catchments are
hydrologically linked by the Grand Canal, but most of the surface flow from Shandong Province
waterways flows directly to the ocean rather than to the Huai River and Yangtze River.
Figure 1.3 gives the project areas and major rivers in the Shandong section of the Huai River Basin.
Water Resources of Project Cities
Feicheng
There are seven large rivers crossing the city: Wenhe, Kangwang, Caohe, Zhouhe, Huihe, Xiaohuihe,
and Jinxianghe Rivers. The total length is 196.3 km.
Heze
There are three rivers passing Heze city; Zhaowang, Wangfu, and Zhushui. Wastewater discharges
have caused serious pollution to the water bodies, and all lakes and rivers in the city are worse than
Class V surface water quality standards at present. The pollutants are discharged into Dongzhaowang
and Zhushui Rivers that lead to Nan Si hu Lake before they reach the Huai river catchment.
Rizhao/Ju County
Rizhao City is located in the east of Shandong Province besides the Yellow Sea. The municipality
lies within the Huai River Basin administrative and planning boundary. A large proportion of the
municipality, comprising Ju County, drains to the Shu River, a tributary of the Huai River. However,
the area around Rizhao drains to a smaller system of rivers that discharge locally to the Yellow Sea.
Cheng Wu Paper Mill
The paper mill discharges to the Dongyu River, a tributary of Nansi Lake via Dushan Lake.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                            Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
Current WPCP Compliance Status
In 1999, the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences (CRAES) selected 45 major
stations to investigate the current water quality of the Huai River Basin. Data from national
environmental water quality reports between 1986 to 1993, 1994 for the Huai mainstream, 1995 to
1996 for trans-boundary assessments and some incomplete data from 1997 and 1998 were used by
CRAES to determine the existing water quality of the river basin. CRAES (1999) reported that of the
45 sections, only 4 reached their designated beneficial use classification.
It is undoubtedly true that the total COD loading in 1997 in Shandong Province also exceeds the
WPCP goals, but data is not readily available. Although the municipal and industrial loading was
under the plan goal for 1997, the WPCP did not account for the "other" sources of COD in the basin.
In addition, the municipal and industrial progress since 1997 lagged behind plan goals so that the year
2000 goals of 64,700 tons for Shandong province have not been met. SIEP estimates that the current
year 2000 COD loading in Shandong Province is approximately 213,000 t/year, including TVEs and
nonpoint source pollution. The HRWPCP projects will remove approximately 37,145 t/year of COD,
leaving the overall Shandong loading well in excess of the target of 67,400 t/year.
Need for the Project
According to the draft "3H Basins Action Program Study for Water Resources, Water Pollution
Control" prepared in November 1999 for the Ministry of Water Resources and the World Bank
(known as the '3H Study since it covers the Hai, Huai, and Huang rivers), the Plan goals have not
been met in the Huai River basin. This report indicates that significant additional resources are
required to meet the Class IIIIV standards of the Basin Plan, and that rural sources such as
uncontrolled township and village enterprises (TVEs) and non-point source pollution (mainly polluted
agricultural and urban runoff) will remain a problem even after implementation of industrial controls
and domestic wastewater treatment.
Implementation of industrial and domestic wastewater treatment lags behind the proposed
implementation schedule due to funding problems. The main pollutants are unionised ammonia, BOD,
COD and bacteria levels, and the problems are especially acute in the dry seasons when background
flows are reduced to at or near zero levels. As such, the water quality problems in the Huai River
Basin remain severe, the implementation of municipal WwTW has been slow, and the HRWPCP is
targeted to support a major need. It is the national goal to have wastewater collectiDn and secondary
treatment facilities constructed in all cities within the Huai River Basin. Many of the cities in the
basin have already been building wastewater collection and treatment facilities with international and
bilateral assistance. The HRWPCP is designed to complement the overall basin objectives by
supplementing these ongoing efforts in the major cities of the Shandong Province that have not been
addressed by other projects.

The Prioritisation of Schemes
Provision of wastewater collection and treatment facilities in the cities of the Huai river basin is a
priority action item in the WPCP, and a critical component shown in the 3H Rivers Action Plan ('3H'
is 3 basins - Hai, Huai and Huang). The Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) of Water Pollution
Control in the Huai River Basin anticipated that much of the construction of wastewater collection
and WwTWs would be completed by the year 2000, but the programme is running well behind
schedule. The HRWPCP has been designed to complement the activities already underway to move
quickly toward the national Basin goal. As outlined in the 3H Rivers Action Plan, comprehensive
municipal and industrial wastewater treatment as well as agricultural and urban non-point source
controls are necessary to allow the Basin to meet these goals, and the HRWPCP fosters these efforts.
Overview of HRWPCP Phase I Project Components
Shandong Province is currently proposing four municipal wastewater schemes and one industrial
pollution control sub-component for inclusion in the HRWPCP. All the municipal wastewater
schemes involve improvement and extension of existing sewerage networks and three include new
WwTWs. Most of the sub-components also include operation and maintenance equipment including
laboratory equipment and vehicles. The Rizhao City component also includes construction of sea
outfalls. One of the cities, Ju County, has a WwTW under construction using only local funding.
Hence, this WwTW is outside of this project.

Shandong Province
All the sewerage schemes will involve both the interception of existing combined sewage or industrial
wastewater outfalls and provision of first wastewater collection in more recently developed areas of
the cities. Wastewater will be conveyed to WwTWs and will make a major contribution to control of
water pollution in the Huai River Basin, and in the case of Rizhao, control pollution in off-shore
waters and on bathing beaches. Table ES-1 and ES-2 shows the project details that are proposed for
the HRWPCP in Shandong Province:

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                              Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
Technical Assistance
The WB considers it critical that institutions responsible for implementing and managing HRWPCP
sub-projects are equipped with the management and technical knowledge, skills and equipment
necessary to carry out their mandates. A technical assistance (TA) needs assessment is scheduled and
this will form the basis for an institutional programme which will provide training and equipment to
the provincial and city PIUs, Provincial and City EPBs, and the wastewater operating companies or
departments.
Of particular relevance to the EA, the project includes an overall environmental strengthening
component in the area of environmental monitoring. This strengthening is aimed at improving the
city and provincial ability to monitor and report on environmental conditions under stress, as well as
providing the means to better assess the environmental performance of the project investment
package.
Water and Environmental Objectives
The Constitution of the People's Republic of China (1982) provides the framework for environmental
protection law in China. Article 26 of the Constitution stipulates that the "the-State protects and
improves the living environment and the ecological environment, prevents and remedies pollution and
,other public hazards." National legislation is comprehensive and appears to cover most areas of
environmental concern. However, the level of enforcement in Shandong (as in the rest of China) is
clearly often less than satisfactory. The Chinese economy continues to grow rapidly and there is often
a trade-off between the strict enforcement of environmental legislation and promoting economic
growth and employment.
All surface waters in China have been classified according to these ambient stream standards. The
following is a general translation of the surface water classes:
Class         Description
I           used for water sources and state nature reserves
II          used for class I protection areas for drinking water sources, protection zones
for valuable fish, spawning grounds of fish and shrimps
III         used for class II protection areas for drinking water sources, general
protection zones for fish and bathing areas
IV          used for general industrial water areas and water recreation areas where no
direct contact with humans occurs
V           used for agricultural water areas and scenic water areas.
Project Benefits
Public health projects like the HRWPCP carry many general benefits to the citizens of the project
cities. The project reports outline specific and quantified benefits in the areas of:
*      Raising the Output of Agricultural, Fish and Livestock Production
*      increased Domestic Output Due to Improved Water Resources
*      Public Health Improvements

Increased Revenue from Tourism
*       Increased Real Estate Values
*       Improved Surface Water Quality
Other additional potential benefits might include:
Reduced risk of groundwater contamination in the service areas.
The impact of making realistic charges for wastewater services, should help to
encourage waste minimisation at source, and internalise the costs of pollution control.
*       Amenity benefits to the population of project cities are likely to accrue as the quality
of the adjacent rivers improve. This could include use of the river for recreational
purposes and the development of riverside walks and parks for public use.
Social Impacts
Resettlement and compensation plans have been prepared and are covered in a separate "Resettlement
Action Plan" (RAP). The final RAP has been prepared for the World Bank at the same time as this
EA and the summary is shown in Table ES-3.

Environmental Impacts
Potential construction phase impacts are relatively minor and easily mitigated. These construction
impacts have been sorted according to their geographic location within the overall project scheme.
Details of mitigation measures, the monitoring required to ensure that mitigation measures are
effectively implemented, and responsibilities are provided in detailed charts. HRWPCP PMOs will
have an ongoing responsibility to track and report the monitoring work of all the identified agencies,
in addition to their own direct monitoring activities.
The potential operational phase impacts are relatively minor and easily mitigated. Many of the
concerns have been addressed in the course of the design of the wastewater collection and wastewater
treatment facilities. Details of mitigation measures, a programme for monitoring mitigation measures
and responsibilities are provided in detailed charts.
The economic analysis for HRWPCP  component projects indicates that they are needed  and
affordable for the population of the cities. This project is meeting a "backlog" need for environmental
infrastructure and should not induce adverse extensive growth or secondary impacts. The present
environmental problems arc serious and the provision of this environmental infrastructure is necessary

for current needs and to mitigate current problems. Future problems without the project would
become even more critical.
Mitigation and Monitoring Budget
The capital budgets prepared for all HRWPCP component projects include allowances for necessary
laboratory construction and equipment. Using this equipment to perform the necessary and required
testing by the utility is also included in the operations budget for the project.  Environmental
strengthening is considered a critical component of the HRWPCP project and a detailed Technical
Assistance (TA) programme is being developed to address the needs. This includes training in
management and operations for the PMOs and the utility companies, in a wide variety of disciplines.
There is a component for an Environmental Monitoring Centre in the project to provide both
equipment and training for city EPBs and the provincial EPBs.
These facilities and the training planned will greatly facilitate the monitoring of the environmental
impact mitigation measures proposed. Furthermore, accomplishing the specified monitoring and
reporting outlined in this mitigation plan will be greatly enhanced by the TA program. This TA
program will also allow for improved overall performance assessment of the HRWPCP programme
4elative to meeting the project objectives. Future Phases of the HRWPCP will benefit from such
assessments.
Despite the above facilities and training the conduct of the mitigation monitoring programme will
require additional funding. Cost estimates to cover long-term environmental monitoring have been
estimated.  "Long-term" is defined as annual monitoring required to verify the environmental
performance and other operational mitigation measures previously outlined.  These mitigation
monitoring costs are being added into the utility operational cost estimates. Costs for mitigation
measures that relate to the management of construction will be included in the tender documents and
responsibility passed on to the construction contractors. Table ES-4 summarises the monitoring cost
estimates.

*      "Without Project" Alternatives
In addition, detailed technical evaluations were conducted on the Chengwu Paper Mill relative to
technical suitability and cost effectiveness of proposed industrial wastewater controls.
Public Participation in the EA
During the 12-month project development time leading up to pre-appraisal and this EA, there have
been many meetings with the city PMOs, utility companies, city EPBs and other affected city
organisations to discuss the proposed projects and environmental assessments. These meetings have
occurred monthly at a minimum and have resulted in full collaboration with local officials and full
support of the project and the EA process.
It is estimated that in total 30-40 meetings have been held with the public and over 50 meetings have
been held with local government officials during the development of the projects.
SIEP public participation activity developed by the assessment unit and construction unit adopted
random sampling questionnaire investment and holding colloquia, using these two kinds of methods.
This public participation investigates public's advice and suggestion by using research papers. Public
scope includes villages near the plant, factories and enterprises. The public includes workers, peasants
and students etc. of different ages, professions, cultural levels.
In addition, according to the arrangement of the World Bank's experts, each project construction unit
will release project information by the media of newspaper, TV, etc. The public can consult relative
files of environmental assessment in appointed place arranged by sub-project construction unlit, and

the public can express standpoint and view adequately. The media information release was held from
July 15, 2000 to July 31, 2000.
The many meetings with public officials in the province coupled with the HDI surveys of public
support show that these projects are extremely positive and well received by the public. No
objections have been received by the city PMO's and there is no indication that there is anyone that is
not is support of these projects or would try to stop their completion.
Overall HRWPCP Project Assessment
The HRWPCP projects have been properly formulated and they will form an important contribution
to the achievement of the goals of the WPCP. The construction of WwTWs in the Huai River Basin
has lagged behind the planned schedule of the WPCP, making it more important than ever to
accelerate WwTW construction. Significant progress has been made in regard to the control of
industrial pollution since the WPCP was formulated. However, domestic wastewater collection and
treatment remains well behind the WPCP schedule.
With respect to the environmental protection, the general urban plan and the drainage project plan, the
design of collecting wastewater of proposed HRWPCP projects in the Shandong project cities has
proved to be reasonable, as well as and the location selection of wastewater pump stations and
WwTWs. The locations of the WwTWs meet the requirements of the local urban plans and the
environmental protection.   For the Chengwu  Paper Mill, project alternatives have been
comprehensively assessed, and the proposed project is technically superior and cost-effective. The
project will greatly reduce water pollution loading downstream of Chengwu.
Total Water Pollutants Removed
The HRWPCP project cities will all benefit from improved surface water quality after implementation
of the HRWPCP and construction of sewerage, WwTWs and industrial wastewater facilities. For the
HRWPCP, the cities of Feicheng and Heze will benefit directly from the WwTW construction funded
by the HRWPCP, and the surface waters adjacent to Rizhao upstream of the ocean will also be
improved. The improved water quality treatment system at the Chengwu Paper Mill will have
positive impacts. After the HRWPCP is implemented, situation of discharged and reduced volume of
COD,r is shown in Table ES-5.

According to the maximum permitted discharged volume of each total volume control section in
Table ES-5, discharged volume of COD before the HRWPCP is implemented and the distance
between sewage discharged site and the section, without the HRWPCP, discharged volume of total
volume control section in the related rivers will all exceed the standard. And, COD volume that enters
into the river in 2000 will not satisfy the permitted volume either.
After the HRWPCP is implemented, volume of COD that enters to related river will satisfy the
requirement of WPCP goals in year 2000. After the project is implemented, decreased COD volume
when operating in full load condition accounts for 46.9% of all reduced COD volume needed to
satisfy total volume control target in year 2000 in Huaihe valley (not including Rizhao and Feicheng
project). The construction of the project will have great effect on the realising of total volume control
target in Huaihe valley administrated by Shandong. Table ES-6 provides the SIEP estimates of COD
reductions associated with HRWPCP projects.

From Table ES-7, it can be seen that the COD quantity to the river for near the proposed WwTWs
can be greatly reduced by the HRWPCP projects. The low water period of Zhushui River can reach
standard of class V and the flood period of Kangwang River can reach class IV. But each water
period of the other rivers can't reach the requirement of class V, although it can satisfy the water
quality requirement of farmland irrigation. (water farming: COD<200 gil, dry farming: COD<300 g/l,
vegetable COD<I5Omg/L).

From Table ES-8, the control section's water quality of related river can be improved in different
degrees after each WwTW and Chengwu sub-projects are finished. Especially after alkali recovery,
mid-piece water treatment plant of Chengwu paper mill has been put into operation, the mill's
wastewater effluent can reach the standards completely. It improves the water quality of Dongyu
River (Xuzhai brake section) significantly.
In the second place, water quality of Shu River (Xiazhuang section) and Zhuzhaoxin River (Yulou
section) can be improved in different degree after finishing WwTW matching to waste pipe network
of Ju county and Heze WwTW. Because of the longer distance (approximate 100km) between
Feicheng WwTW and Wangtai bridge section of Daqing River and less ratio of water quantity treated
by works to flux of Daqing River, it is limited to improve the water quality of Daqing River after
finishing the project.
The discharge quantity of CODc, meets requirement of Total Quantity Control index made by local
government. Furthermore, the quantity of SO2 and smoke dust emitted by oil-burning boiler of Heze
wastewater treatment plant, boiler and alkali retrieval boiler of Chengwu paper mill also meets the
index. After the project being carried out, the actual reduced quantity of CODcr is 4.82 to 1.92 times
compared with the planned reduced quantity.

Shandong Province
So the construction of project would play an active role in reaching the target of Total Quantity
Control in Huai river valley of Shandong province. However, the HRWPCP project cannot attain the
total control indicators on its own in the short-term, and significant additional investment is required
for both point and non-point source pollution to allow the Shandong river reaches to meet the water
quality targets.
Conclusions and Recommendations
1. The environmental conditions are serious and the environmental infrastructure needs of Shandong
Province are high, and expanding rapidly.
2. The HRWPCP projects have emerged from a basin-wide prioritisation process, are well
formulated, and have detailed and complete preliminary designs and cost estimates.
3. There is good public support for the projects based on meetings in the project cities and public
opinion surveys.
4.. The proposed projects can meet financial and economic tests of sustainability and are affordable
to the local citizens.
5. Social impacts, consisting mainly of land acquisition and resettlement, are addressed by a detailed
RAP, and, in any case, are not significantly adverse.
6. The potential environmental benefits of the Phase HRWPCP projects are large, as reported in the
previous sections. However, there are significant additional point and non-point water quality
controls necessary, along with hydrologic needs to maintain minimum stream-flows, before the
WPCP goals can be realised in the Province.
7. Potential construction and operational phase impacts of the proposed HRWPCP projects have
been adequately assessed and no major issues have been identified. Detailed mitigation and
monitoring procedures have been prepared which should adequately lessen the overall effect of
these potential impacts. Monitoring costs have been included for this work and assignments
detailed.
8. The recommendations included herein by the Shandong Research and Design Institute are rational
and should be considered in the design and construction of these projects. These
recommendations included:
a) Main plants of discharging pollutants in the service scope of WwTW should enhance spot
pollution source control. The concentration of wastewater discharge should attain the
standard of accepting water of WwTW.
b) The sludge treatment method of compost or making compound fertilizer should be further
demonstrated in order to improve the benefit of WwTW.
c) Other cities in Huai river valley of Shandong province should built WwTWs as soon as
possible.

d) Tertiary wastewater treatment equipment should be constructed in order to improve
treatment effect when the economic conditions allow. Tertiary wastewater treatment
provides positive condition of reusing wastewater.
e) It is suggested that secondary biochemical treatment technique should be adopted when
the second phase of construction of Rizhao WwTW is being carried out.
f Special design of treatment field should be made before the white mud and sludge being
treated in Chengwu subproject.
9. The overall conclusion is that the potential positive impacts are large, the potential negative
construction and operation impacts can be successfully mitigated, and the projects contain no
serious problems or "fatal flaws" in its formulation. The project components are essentially
environmentally positive and should be approved.

Shandong Province
1    INTRODUCTION
1.1     Huai River Water Pollution Control Project (HRWPCP) Background
1.1.1    Pollution in the Huai River Basin
The Huai River Basin lies across four provinces in the centre of China, covering an area of 270,000
km2 between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. The Basin is divided into two major systems: The Huai
River System (190,000 kIM2) originating in the west and about 1,000 km long with 120 tributaries
flows east to south through Hongze Lake and discharges into the Yangtze River. The Yi-Shu-Si River
System (80,000 kM2) originates in the north, flows southwest and discharges into the Yellow Sea.
The Grand Canal in the east connects the Huai and Yi-Shu-Si systems as well as the Yangtze and
Yellow rivers.
The economic and environmental impacts of water pollution on the Huai River Basin area are
widespread and acute. In 1994, severe water pollution caused temporary production stoppage at many
factories and drinking water problems for many inhabitants in the Huai River Basin. The cause of the
1994 Huai River pollution incident was discharge of significantly polluted wastewater from many
straw pulp factories, paper mills, and tanneries in Henan Province and Anhui Province located in the
upstream portion of the Ying He River. These industries discharged a great quantity of polluted
-vastewater during the dry season when the flow control gates and barrages are predominantly closed.
Since 60 to 70 % of the annual river flow occurs during May-August time period, the gates maintain
surface water levels but also store the incoming pollution. This accumulated polluted wastewater
discharged during the flood season when the gates opened, resulting in significant downstream
pollution. The pollution caused power stations to malfunction causing major impacts on the Hua
Dong power network. Fishery resources were destroyed and agricultural and industrial damage was
widespread. Water supplies were all affected resulting in significant impacts on the people of the
downstream cities. Direct economic damages were estimated at over one billion Yuan.
Consequently the State Council has authorised various actions to combat water pollution and prevent
future pollution disasters in the Huai River Basin. The central government approved the "Ninth Five-
Year Plan (1996-2000) of Water Pollution Control (WPCP) in June of 1996. The WPCP indicated
that most of the stream sections in Shandong Province only met Class IV-V standards in some
sampling points and it listed both natural and social elements as causing the serious pollution in the
Huai River Basin as follows:
*      Rapid development of townships and village enterprises but with out-of-date
technologies. Most of those town/village enterprises (TVE) utilise simple equipment
with backward technologies that are no longer used by urban industries and no
pollution control facilities are used. Wastewater with highly concentrated pollutant
loads are drained directly into rivers.
*     Unreasonable industrial structure which produces high pollution but low output.
Traditionally, the agricultural development is high in the Basin while the industry
base was very weak. However, industry is developing quickly. In particular, those
processing enterprises with low technical requirements, using the local agricultural
products as raw materials, are developing most quickly, such as the light industries of
papermaking and winemaking.

Shandong Province
Rapid urbanisation with large increase in sewage production. The sewage quantity
from the middle and small size cities/townships increased several times from 1984 to
1993, and the direct result was that the water quality in many rivers in the Basin
decreased by one class level.
*      Shortage of funds for environmental protection. According to the statistics in 1993,
730 million tons industrial wastewater was treated which was only 31.7% of the total
in the whole Basin. Furthermore, only 12.4% of the treated wastewater reaches the
required discharge standards while the average rate in the whole country is around
50%. The increase of investment for water pollution control is not keeping pace with
the economic development speed.
*       Serious seasonal shortages of water. The water resources in the Basin are in shortage
and the proportion of water flow to sewage discharge in many rivers in dry season is
under 10:1, that means not enough water to dilute the sewage. Even the discharge
treated by the secondary stage treatment plant needs 6  10 times water for dilution in
order to reach the water quality standard class III for mainstream and standard class
IV for tributary streams (based on GHZB 1-99 Water Quality Standard).
*      Incomplete  environment protection  organisation, failure  in  compliance  with
environmental laws. At the time, no independent environment protection agency was
available in many counties and cities, and, there were not en-ough workers or
management staff with the required high qualifications.
As a result of these evaluations, the WPCP for the Huai River Basin defined the targets for the Basin
as follows:
e       3By 1997, all the wastewater discharges from industrial pollution sources should meet
standards for effluent and the total COD should be reduced from 1.5 million tons in
1993 to 0.89 million tons (0.2638 million tons from Shandong Province.);
*       3By 2000, the total COD should be reduced to 0.368 million tons (0.0647 million tons
from Shandong Province.);
3      By 2000, the Huai River main stream, main tributaries, and rivers that are sources for
urban water supplies should reach the Class III of the National Surface Water
Standard.
According to the draft "3H Basins Action Program Study for Water Resources, Water Pollution
Control" prepared in November 1999 for the Ministry of Water Resources and the World Bank
(known as the '3H Study' since it covers the Hai, Huai, and Huang rivers), the Plan goals have not
been met in the Huai River Basin. This report indicates that significant additional resources are
required to meet the Class III/IV standards of the Plan, and that rural sources such as uncontrolled
township and village enterprises (TVEs) and non-point source pollution (mainly polluted agricultural
and urban runoff) will remain a problem even after implementation of industrial controls and
domestic wastewater treatment. Implementation of industrial and domestic wastewater treatment lags
behind the proposed implementation schedule due to funding problems. The main pollutants are
unionised ammonia, BOD, COD and bacteria levels, and the problems are especially acute in the dry
seasons when base flows are reduced to zero or near zero levels.
There is an existing system of 82 water quality control sections established in the Huai basin. Of
these, 29 are trans-provincial stations that are monitored by the Huai River Basii Commission
(HRBC). The remainder are monitored by local EPBs.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                           Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
In 1999, the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences (CRAES) selected 45 major
stations to investigate the current water quality of the Huai River Basin. Data from national
environmental water quality reports between 1986 to 1993, 1994 for the Huai main stream, 1995 to
1996 for trans-boundary assessments and some incomplete data from 1997 and 1998 were used by
CRAES to determine the existing water quality of the river basin.
CRAES (1999) reported that of the 45 sections, only 4 reached their designated beneficial use
classification. These were Bantai on the Hong River, Shakou on the Ru River, Baoying on the Li
Canal and Jin Lake. The 41 sections that fail to meet the designated beneficial use classification were
categorised in CRAES (1999) into 5 types as shown in Table 1.1.
Table 1.1: Polluted Water Type Categorization in Huai Basin
Type   Comment
I     Water unsuitable as drinking water source. Mainly Anhui Control area in middle
reaches of Huai system.
2     Polluted water crossing 2 or more Provinces. Mainly in Henan control area and Yi-
Shu-Si River control area.
3     Pollution in shallow groundwater aquifers and of drinking water sources. Mainly
Anhui control area.
4     Pollution of enclosed water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs. Hongze Lake
control area and Nansi Lakes (in Shandong).
5     Polluted industrial and agricultural wastewater in urban areas and waters that, in
addition, are aesthetically impaired. This category applies to all sub-basins.
Source: CRAES (1999).
The main pollutants identified were organic such as BOD, COD and ammonia nitrogen. Sections
downstream of industries also showed elevated heavy metal pollution. Monitoring is undertaken on
the stream flow and bottom sediments were not sampled. It is therefore probable that toxicity is
understated in the sampling because of the transitory nature of stream flow pollution and industrial
discharges. The Huai River also experiences seasonal low flow conditions, though they are not as
severe as in the Hai Basin. The combination of low flow and gross pollution of the river system leads
to environmental and public health problems such as over exploitation of groundwater resources and
inappropriate use of wastewater. In addition, the Ministry of Water Resources monitors stations in the
Basin. Work by the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research (IWHR) shows a
long-term trend of degradation in the river system, both in terms of increased wastewater volumes and
(consequentially) degraded water quality. IWHR (1999) provides the information shown in Table 1.2.

Some recent data was provided by Pacific Consultants with Danish Hydraulic Institute (PC/DHI)
(1999) for the provinces of Henan and Anhui for the years 1996 and 1997. The industrial componelnt
of this information was provided by the provincial Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPBs) and the
municipal component was calculated by PC/DHI from water consumption and per capita COD

believed valid in Shandong.)
The municipal waste load shows an annual increase as may be expected however the industrial COD
loads show dramatic decreases in both provinces, a result claimed as the effect of industrial discharge
enforcement. The data is shown in Table 1.3. The "other" categories contributing pollution loads are
agriculture and livestock of which the livestock is the larger by a factor of about 10 times.

It is undoubtedly true that the total COD loading in 1997 in Shandong Province also exceeds the
WPCP goals, but data is not readily available. Although the municipal and industrial loading was
under the plan goal for 1997, the WPCP did not account for the "other" sources of COD in the basin.
In addition, the municipal and industrial progress since 1997 lagged behind plan goals so that the year
2000 goals of 64,700 tons for Shandong province have not been met.
As part of these efforts of the State Council and the four Huai Basin provinces (i.e. Henan, Anhui,
Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces) to meet water pollution control targets, the Huai River Water
Pollution Control Project (HRWPCP) is currently being prepared for Anhui and Shandong Provinces.
At the request of PRC, the World Bank has listed the proposed project in the lending programme for
WB fiscal year 2000/2001. Water pollution control in Henan and Jiangsu is being dealt with under a
separate programme.
1.1.2    Shandong Province Overview
Shandong Province covers most of the Yi-Shu-Si System area of the Huai River Basin. The
mainstream of the Huai River does not flow through the Province. Pollution is mainly organic, with
sections in urban reaches being more polluted than rural reaches.
By December 1996, to control pollution in the Basin and in accordance with stipulation of the "Ninth
Five-Year Plan," the province had closed approximately 460 small enterprises causing serious pollution.
Other small and medium polluting enterprises have continued to be closed in the Basin, and other
polluting enterprises have had their production curtailed in the dry season to reduce wastewater
discharges.

The general location of Shandong Province is shown in Figure 1.1. (Note that all figures in this report
are located at the end of the respective chapters.)
1.1.3    Provincial Government
Shandong Province and its municipalities address environmental problems within the same institutional
and regulatory framework found elsewhere in China. The provincial and municipal Environmental
Protection Bureaux (EPBs) and the Urban Construction Commissions (UCCs) and their agencies share
regulatory powers. The central government's general strategy for urban development has been to
develop mechanisms for planning and management at the local level that will reduce waste and enable
cities to function effectively using local resources.
To arrive at the "best practices," local governments are encouraged to try new approaches. The results
are then readily disseminated through the press, professional associations, technical intermediaries, and
national ministries.  Cities of moderate population size are often good testing grounds for bold
experimentation and the largest cities serve best as national demonstration models. The HRWPCP has
been formulated by the national government, local officials and the World Bank in a manner consistent
with this approach by targeting a combination of large and moderate population sized cities for selected
interventions.
1.1.4    Huai River Water Pollution Control Project (HRWPCP) and the World Bank
The background and overall World Bank policies related to the urban environment in China are
reported in the China Urban Environment Service report of December 1994. Table 1.4 gives a brief
summary of the key issues and challenges, as presented in this report:

Shandong Province
Table 1.4: Environmental Background Problems, China (1994)
Key Issue                                 Items of Concern
Water Demand        High per capita water demand and new strategies must accord with reformed
market organisation of the economy and rely more on price to guide enterprise
and consumer choices.
Current demand policy sets quotas for industrial water use and recycling but
Chinese industries are consuming far above international best practice levels.
There is a reported very low unaccounted-for-water (Ufw) of 8.4%, which is
questionable compared to reported pipe breakage rates and pipe joint quality.
Current water prices are far below the level required to encourage water
conservation.
Wastewater          Present low treatment coverage and design and management problerns. All
treatment           cities should expand the sewerage coverage for a minimum 90% of the built-
up areas within five years.  Medium  and large cities should provide a
minimum of primary WwTW in a phased 1 0-year programme.
Industrial          Only 4.5% of industrial wastewater is treated but EPBs report that 50% of the
Wastewater          industrial wastewater meets  effluent standards, which  is seemingly
inconsistent or indicative of inadequate discharge standards and enforcement.
Solid Waste         Landfills are poorly controlled and the provision of adequately engineered and
managed landfills would provide the largest single improvement in solid
waste handling in China.
Environmental       The chief management obstacle is the significant gaps in regulatory control
Management          and problems in implementation of existing regulations. A combination of
infrequent monitoring and low fines for violations encourages non-
compliance. Incentives for cost savings are much stronger than incentives for
strong environmental performance.
Tariffs             Tariffs should be designed to allow full cost recovery. China has adopted the
"polluter pays" principle but price setting is still politicised.  Financial
arrangements to cover operations cost shall be established.
Affordability       There does not appear to be a general affordability issue but the urban poor
(probably 0.5% of the population) need to be protected from cost of living
increases.
In response to deteriorating water pollution conditions in the Huai River Basin, the national
government in April 1996 produced the "Water Pollution Control Program and Nilth Five-Year Plan
for the Huai River Basin", Working Group for Water Pollution Control Plan (WPCP). The Program
contained definitive water pollutioni reduction targets for municipal and industrial waste discharges in
the basin.
However, the Program does not include consideration of rural sources such as TVEs and non-point
pollutant loading to the rivers, which appears to be over 50% of the overall 1997 COD loading in the

basin (3H Action Plan, 1999). Implementation of the plan, nevertheless, is considered a big step
forward toward acceptable levels of river water quality in the basin.
The Huai River Water Pollution Control Project (HRWPCP) is also a key element of China's Agenda
21 programme. The sector-related goal for the project is:
Improve quality of water for the entire basin by providing environmental
infrastructure operated in a sustainable manner
The HRWPCP objectives are to:
1. Upgrade water quality in the Huai River (Class III target) and its tributaries (Class IV
target) within the two provinces.
2. Establish performing and efficient wastewater agencies.
3. Consolidate water quality monitoring system and procedures.
To accomplish this goal and objectives, the outputs for each project component are:
1. Increase in municipal wastewater collection.
_ -;      2. Increase in quantity of wastewater treatment.
3. Implementation of cost-recovery for wastewater operations.
1.1.5    EA Production
The Provincial EA for Shandong Province was conducted by the Shandong Scientific Research and
Design Institute of Environmental Protection (SIEP), under the Shandong Provincial Environmental
Protection Bureau (EPB) in Jinan. The Chinese final version was submitted to SEPA for approval in
July 2000 and it is hoped that SEPA approval will be received by the end of August 2000. This
English version is based on a SIEP translation of their Chinese version.
1.2     Description of the Study Area
1.2.1    Project Area and Population
Within the overall Basin pollution control area, the Anhui-Shandong "project area", considered for the
HRWPCP projects and EA, is shown in Figure 1.2. It comprises an area of about 187 thousand km2
and is heavily populated with almost 110 million people and contains many medium-size urban areas.
The main agricultural activities of the area are growing cotton and grains. The area also contains
some 150 major industrial plants manufacturing pulp and paper, beverages, food processing,
tanneries, chemicals, fertilizer, etc, and about 3,000 small paper mills, tanneries and breweries.
Within this area, Shandong Province is approximately 156,700 km2, of which 47,100 km2 is located
within the Huai River Basin. The 1998 population of the Shandong Province was 86. 1 0 millioll, with
some 23 million in urban areas. The portion of Shandong Province within the Huai River Basin was
about 30 million total, with 1.2 million in urban areas. This EA covers all HRWPCP component
projects contained in Shandong province and a separate provincial level EA covers HRWPCP
component projects located in Anhui province.

1.2.2    Economy of Shandong Province
Shandong is one of the larger agricultural provinces in China. The rural population constitutes 75
percent of the province's total population with 6.87 million hectares of cultivated land. In 1996, the
outputs of grain, cotton, oil crops, vegetables, fruits, and aquatic products were 43.33 million tons,
372,000 tons, 3.09 million tons, 55.2 million tons, 8.44 million tons, and 5.87 tons respectively. Such
agriculture outputs were ranked at a leading position in whole of China. At present, Shandong has
basically formed a complete industrial framework including energy, chemical, metallurgical, building
materials, machinery-building, electronics, textile and food processing industries. The average income
of urban and rural population were 4,494 and 2,086 Yuan respectively in 1996.
The transportation networks in Shandong include roadways such as State Highways, Provincial
Highways and secondary roads, railways to Beijing and Shanghai as well the railway networks within
the Province, and the waterways including rivers and lakes in the Huai River Basin.
About 45 to 55% of land in the project area is used for residential and industrial purposes. Other land
uses include warehouses, education, public facilities, transportation, and cultivated land. Land use
throughout the Province depends on the degree of urbanisation in each city.
Based on site visits and discussions it can be inferred that the Shandong project cities are similar to
.miany of the other Provincial cities in China. Although the area is still very rural, many of the people
are involved in agricultural activities but supplement their incomes through being involved in either
small businesses (private such as restaurants, bike shops, etc.) or transportation of goods or
involvement in industries. In 1997 the PRC Government developed an urban poverty standard and
the threshold was set at RMB 1700/year for the whole country, which correlates to 33% of the per
capita average urban yearly income of RMB5 160.3. Comparison between the urban and rural poverty
standards shows that the urban poverty standard is three times as high as the rural standard for China
as a whole (Year 2000 Chinese poverty standard is 640 RMB/year, the Shandong Rural Poverty
Standard is 1000 RMB/year for year 2000).
The project cities covered in the HRWPCP within Shandong Province are shown in Figure 1.3. The
following sections provide brief backgrounds into these project cities.
Feicheng
Feicheng County is under the administration of Tai'an with the total area of 1,263 km2 and with the
total population inn the county of 990,000. The urban area of Feicheng is comprised of three parts. ie.
Xincheng, Laocheng and Wangguadian with the population of 146,000 in 1999. The Project Area
comprises Xincheng, which contained about 100,000 people in 1999.
Feicheng has a long history and good agriculture outputs such as peach. It was also named as "Home
of Peach". In addition, Feicheng is one of the power supply bases in Shandong province. The
government finance revenue was 193 million yuan in 1997. The average annual income is 2,282 yuan
per capita for rural population in 1997.

Heze
Heze was known as "Chaozhou" in ancient period with a long history of human activities. The natural
conditions are favourable to agriculture and tourism. It is also famous as "Home of Peony", "Home
of Calligraphy and Arts", " Home of Opera", "Home of Martial Arts".
Heze prefecture is situated in the south-western plain of Shandong province and neighbours with
Jiangsu, Henan and Anhui provinces. The south, north and west parts of the city are adjacent to Henan
province and the southeast part of the city is adjacent to Anhui and Jiangsu province. The eastern part
of the city is adjacent to Jining city in Shandong province.
The Heze prefecture has jurisdiction over 8 counties and 1 city. Heze City is the only city in Heze
prefecture. The Project Area comprises of Heze City. The total area of the city is 1,485km2 including
an urban area of 17 km2 with an urban population of 288,000 in 1999. There exists over 80 industry
categories, among which local main industry sectors include chemical, mechanical, electronics, food
processing, power generation etc. The rural economy is gradually developed and also one part of grain
and cotton production bases of China and Shandong province.
Heze City will become a regional centre in south-western Shandong in future in accordance with the
city development master plan. It will play a significant part in regional transportation, energy
,eneration and transmission. The city will be decorated with the features of flowers and lakes.
Rizhao
The Rizhao Municipality was set up in 1985 and was promoted to prefecture level. The municipality
is divided into Donggang District, Ju County and Wulian County. The total area of the municipality
is 5368 km2 and amounting to 3.38% of the area of whole Shandong province. The Project Area
comprises of Rizhao City, which lies within Donggang District (see Figure 1.4). The population of
Rizhao City was 272,000 in 1999.
The GDP reached to 17.5 billion yuan in 1998 and was increased by 13.0% in comparison with GDP
in 1997 based on the comparable prices, in which, the GDP of the primary industry is 4.95 billion
yuan with the annual growth rate of 6.9%; the secondary industry is 6.4 billion with the annual
growth rate of 17.0%; and the tertiary industry is 6.15 billion with the annual growth rate of 13.5%.
The suitable natural conditions help Rizhao to promote the development of the farming, forestry,
animal husbandry and fishery. All the yields of grain, groundnuts, fruits, tobacco plant, silkworm, tea
as well as aquatic products, poke, steak, mutton are in an important position of whole province,
further, Rizhao is an important part of production base of grain, oil, pig and apple in Shandong
Province.
At present, the main industries of Rizhao City include brewing, paper-making, machining, building
materials, food processing, textile, chemical, electronics, etc. The convenient and inexpensive
transportation systems with deep-water port are advantages for development of seaboard industries.
The abundant farm and sideline products provide a possibility to develop local light industry.

Ju County
Ju County is one part of Rizhao Municipality and is located adjacent to the Shu River within the Huai
River Basin. The current population of the county is 950,000 with 5.5 billion yuan of GDP. The
population planned in the urban area, also know as Chengyang (see Figure 1.4), is 100,000 in year
2000 and 200,000 in year 2020 respectively according to the Ju County's development master plan.
The textile and other light industries, food processing industry have great potential and would play an
important role in the Ju county industry development in the future in accordance with the existing
industry structure. Further, the chemical, mechanical processing, building materials would be
gradually developed and a reasonable structure of industry production system on the basis of
agricultural products would be formed. There are three main land transportation paths in the town of
Ju county i.e. Yan-Shan line, Shi-Cong line, and Ju-Ar line. It is very convenient to go to other cities
through these three land roads.
Chengwu
Chengwu is a counity under the administration of Heze prefecture government and also has a long
history of culture and agriculture productive activities.
Chengwu Paper Mill is a State Owned Enterprise (SOE) located in Chengwu near the urban area of
thengwu town. The financial revenue of Chengwu County is 337 million yuan in 1996. The average
annual income is 1,772yuan per capita for rural population.
The Mill uses straw as the raw material to produce some 32,000 tons of pulp per year and 50,000 tons
paper per year (additional pulp is obtained from other pulp mills in the area). The paper product is
reported to be of high quality and is used for writing and toilet paper. The Mill employs some 1500
people. The Mill currently uses up to 20,000 m3/d of water from private groundwater sources for pulp
and paper production. Black liquor created through the pulping process, together with recycled water
from the pulp bleaching and paper manufacturing process is currently treated using chemically
assisted flocculation and pH correction before being discharged to Dong Yu river.
1.2.3    Regional Water Resources
An understanding of the regional water resource management in the Shandong Province is necessary
in order to better appreciate the water quality issues of the study area. The significant urbanisation
and industrialisation in the HRWPCP cities is putting extreme pressure on surface waters. The
following section introduces the local water resource issues of these cities. It is important to realise
that, in addition to the main rivers flowing through the cities, there are many small drainage channels
and tributaries in these urban areas that receive much of the domestic and industrial wastewater
discharges, so the environmental needs extend well beyond the larger, classified surface waters.
The Huai River lies in 31-36north latitude, 112-121 east longitude. The basin has Mt. Tongbo
and Mt. Funiu in the west, Huang (Yellow) Sea in the east, Mt. Dabi and Mt. Wan and the Changjiang
River in the south, and the south bank of Huang (Yellow) River in the north. The area is 270,000 km2
(excluding Yi and Shu River).

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                                       Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
Shandong Province is located in the middle and downstream of Huai River. Within the boundary, the
basin area is 47,100 kM2, or 30.06 % of the total area. Shandong Huai River Basin covers the cities of
Zaozhuang, Jining, Linyi, Taian, and Zibo and the prefecture of Heze. The total number of counties
(districts) in the Shandong part of the Basin is 42.
The river systems of the Huai River Basin in Shandong are shiown in Figure 1.3. The EPB water
quality control sections are shown on this figure, with Class III being the water quality goal for the
Huai River mainstream (not in Shandong), and Class IV for smaller rivers. The current dry-season
water quality of these segments fails to reach this the classification goal the majority of the season,
and many times during the average seasonal flow. As described earlier, the closing of the many river
gates during the dry season can have serious pollution concentrating effects, causing potentially
serious downstream consequences when the wet season arrives (May-August).
Table 1.5 shows the immediate receiving watercourses for each project location and the flow route of
wastewater to its final destination.

t.2.4    Water Resources of Project Cities
Feicheng
There are seven large rivers crossing Feicheng County: Wenhe, Kangwang, Caohe, Zhouhe, Huihe,
Xiaohuihe, and Jinxianghe Rivers. The total length is 196.3 km. Wenhe River originates in Laiwu, at
the foot of the Xintai Mountains. It flows from west to east through Wenyang, An-zhuang, and
Sunxiang villages, with a total length of 36.33 km, and connecting with Dongping County. The
Kangwang River is formed from confluence of Feihe and Kanghe rivers, originating in Wudaoling
Mountains at the north of the city. It flows northerly around east part of the city, flowing through
Yiyang, Xincheng, Wangguadian, Hutuan, Taoyuan and Shiheng towns.
Heze
There are three rivers passing Heze City; Zhaowang, Wangfu, and Zhushui. Wastewater discharges
have caused serious pollution to the water bodies, and all lakes and rivers in the city are worse than
Class V surface water quality standards at present. The pollutants are discharged into Dongzhaowang
and Zhushui Rivers that lead to Nansi Hu Lake.
Heze City is located in south-wester-n Shandong Province, southeast of the North China Plain and
below the south bank of the Yellow River. The Longitude is 1140 48' - I 16 24' east and latitude 340
48' - 350 52' north. The Heze City is a plain that has historically been impacted by Yellow River
flood flows and dike burst.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                            Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
Rizhao
Rizhao City is located in the east of Shandong Province besides the Yellow Sea. The municipality
lies within the Huai River Basin administrative and planning boundary. A large proportion of the
municipality, comprising Ju County, drains to the Shu River in the Huai River Basin. However, the
area around Rizhao City drains to a smaller system of rivers that discharge locally to the Yellow Sea.
Whilst this project will not make a direct impact on the water quality in the Huai Basin the city argues
that it will have an indirect effect by releasing limited municipal finances for other, smaller WwTW
that serve towns which do drain directly to the Huai Basin.
Ju County
The project area comprises the urban city area, which is bounded to the east by the Shu River and to
the west by the Liuqing River. The Yuni stream and Shu river receive most of the city's foul and
surface drainage. The Yuni river flows into the Liuqing River immediately downstream of the urban
area of Ju County. The Liuqing river in tum flows into the Shu River, which is a tributary of the Huai
River Basin.
Cheng Wu Paper Mill
the Chengwu Paper Mill lies on the Dong Yu River - an artificial channel used for drainage and
conveying irrigation water from the Yellow River and discharging to the Nansi Hu Lake. The Dong
Yu River is 178 km long. Average flows for the past few years are reported to be 8.4 m3/s with an
annual average flow of around 60 to 100 million m3/year. However, in the dry season there is almost
no flow in the river. The river is reported to relatively free of pollution upstream of the Chengwu
paper mill but has a naturally high silt content.
The paper mill uses groundwater from self-supply boreholes during the paper manufacturing process
and discharges partially treated effluent to the Dong Yu River.
1.2.5    Domestic Water Supplies and Utilisation
Feicheng
The main source of water supply for the urban area comes from groundwater, but some surface water
is used. The city has one existing WTW and one planned WTW with current capacity of 60,000 t/d,
and estimated capacity by 2010 of 120,000 t/d.  Small surface water reservoirs are planned in
Feicheng basin at Shiwu and Qun Jianghu, to supplement groundwater supplies.
Heze
Groundwater is the primary source of water supply, and the WSC operates three works with capacity
totalling 50,000 m3/day. Self-supply from groundwater sources is reported to be 80,000 m3/day. It is
proposed to construct a new 100,000 to 150,000 m3/d WTW, using surface water resources from the
yellow River, in the near future.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                            Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
Rizhao
The WSC obtains water from the upper reach of the Futuanhe River and Rizhao reservoir. With
completion of the Kuishan WTW in October 1999 the total WSC capacity is now 210,000 m3/day.
Self-supply accounts for only a small proportion of water use in Rizhao.
Ju County
The first existing WTW  has a capacity of only 500 m3/d and is not used because the wells have
become polluted. The second existing WTW has a capacity of 20000 m3/d, but only delivers 13,000
m 3/d, using raw water supply from the Shu he river. The third WTW was built in 1998 with a
capacity of 40,000 m3/d.
Cheng Wu Paper Mill
Chengwu Paper Mill currently uses its own 14 deep borehole wells with total capacity of up to 40,000
m3/d to supply the 32,000 m3/d needed for daily use.
1.2.6    Sewerage Systems
All project cities in Shandong province operate mainly combined sewer systems, with separate
systems being constructed in the newer areas. In the system, sewerage and rainwater flows through
drains, covered by concrete slabs and partially by sewers along the road to the nearest surface
drainage, and onward to the adjacent rivers.
Many houses in the cities have septic tanks but many are too small and regular maintenance is not
usually performed. The goal of all Shandong province cities is the complete separation of all sanitary
sewers but funding limitations will mean that combined sewers with septic tanks will be utilised for
many years. Some of the cities are purchasing vacuum trucks to maintain the tanks in the long period
of time it takes to separate the entire sewer system. The current sewerage design is based on
intercepting up to twice the average dry weather flow in the system, and overflowing the remainder to
surface water during storm events.
Table 1.7 is a listing of current estimated septic tanks and population served taken from the project
feasibility reports, when available.

1.2.7    Solid Waste and Sludge Disposal Systems in Place
There was little information regarding existing solid waste management systems in place in the
HRWPCP project cities, in the Chinese EAs or the FSRs. Of particular interest are landfill conditions
and capacities for the four sub-components with World Bank assisted WwTWs related to the potential
need for use as a sludge disposal alternatives.
Based on experience elsewhere in China, it is expected that the landfills are unlikely to operate using
sanitary design practice and the addition of sludge could exacerbate already problematic operations.
The landfills usually operate more as an open waste dumps, filling available valleys. Of particular
interest, the sludge could cause a small increase in leachate production, and the operation of
successful leachate treatment facilities has again been problematic in most Chinese landfills.
However, the disposal of sludge to landfill still needs to be considered a viable alternative to land
application, especially if the WwTW sludge has problems with heavy metal concentrations and/or
high concentrations of pathogenic bacteria.
In Shandong, the primary sludge from Rizhao WwTW will be stabilised with lime and then used as
fertiliser by Da Sha Wa Forestry Farm. The secondary sludge produced from the-Feicheng WwTW
will be used as fertiliser by Niu Shan Forestry Farm. The secondary sludge from Heze WwTW will be
pisposed in Liu Xia Landfill. The Heze feasibility study refers to the possible incineration of sludge
produced by the WwTW at a new incinerator currently under construction. However, this solution is
under review and the landfill option is now preferred. Sludge from Chengwu Paper Mill will be taken
to three nearby clay pits previously excavated for brick manufacture and now converted to landfills.
1.2.8    Population and Wastewater Projections
The forecasts of population, water supply demand and wastewater discharges presented in the FSRs
have been reviewed. Additional data has been generated by the AC, where necessary, In general, the
FSRs have presented two forecasts. One is based on the city Master Plan. The second represents a
revision of the Master Plan taking into account real data for population and water supply over the last
four to five years and current expected growth trends for the future.
For each municipal sub-component tables and graphs have been presented to compare the FSR
wastewater projections (Master Plan and 'revised' forecasts) and the AC's sensitivity projection. The
sensitivity projections are not specific to each sub-component but instead employ growth rates found
to be typical elsewhere in China as a check on those assumed in the FSR for the project city.
For the Shandong FSRs there is generally good agreement between the AC projection and the FSR
'revised Master Plan' projection. It is concluded in all cases that the FSR projections should be
adopted for sizing the proposed wastewater facilities. In most cases, the 'revised' FSR projections are
suitable as the basis for the financial analysis as well.
Table 1.8 shows the 'revised FSR' population and wastewater projections for the Shandong
HRWPCP cities,

1.4     Scope and Standards of Environmental Assessment
In view of the nature of the proposed projects, the EA scope was divided into two time periods,
construction phase and operational phase. In both of these phases, the scope included the necessary
treatment and disposal systems as well as the related collection systems and other project facilities.
The standards for the EA of the projects were identified by the Provincial and City Environmental
Protection Bureaux and they included:
*      Ambient air: Class B of Ambient Air Quality Standard, GB3095-1996;
*      Surface Water Environment: Categories III and IV  of State Environmental
Protection Standard, GHZB I - 1999 (effective 01-01-2000)
-      Acoustic Environment: Class B of Urban Regional Noise Standard, GB3096-93
The appropriate discharge standards for use in this EA included:
*      Air pollutants: Emission Standard of Air Pollutants for Coal-burning Oil-burning
Gas-Burning Boiler GWPB3-1999; Class B of Emission Standard for Offensive
Odour Pollutant GB14554-93
*      Water pollutants: Class of Integrated Discharge Standard for Wastewater, GB8978-
96; Discharge Standard of Water Pollutants for Paper Industry, GWPB2-1999.
*      Noise: Class B of Boundary Noise Standard for Industrial Enterprises, GB 12348-90.
Boundary Noise Standard for Construction Sites, GB12523-90.
*      Solid wastes: Pollutant Control Standard for Agricultural Sludge GB4284-88.
Environment assessment classifications during the project operation period were defined on the basis
of the drainage output, pollutants, receiver volume and water quality from the wastewater treatment
works in line with the related classification requirements found in the Chinese "Technical Guidelines
of Environment Impact Assessment". Table 1.9 provides a summary of the EA classification, in
accordance with SEPA standard classifications, used by Shandong Scientific Research and Design

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                            Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
2    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
2.1     Overview of Huai River Basin
The Yi-Shu-Si River System forms the eastern part of the Huai River Basin. It originates from
Shandong Province and flows south-west and south towards Jiangsu Province and discharges into the
Yellow Sea via Luoma Lake and a system of interlinked canals and rivers. The mainstream of the
Huai River does not flow through Shandong Province, however, the two parts of the Huai River Basin
are linked by the Grand Canal.
The yearly rainfall in the Huai River Basin is about 900 mm, out of which 70-80% occurs in summer.
There is, therefore, considerable variation in river flow. The Huai River has an annual average flow
of 855 m3/s, with flood flows reaching over 11,000 m3/s, while in drought conditions flows drop to
nearly zero even in the lower reaches of the river. In addition to four main flood gates on the Huai
River, the river system contains an estimated 4,300 sluices and over 5,000 reservoirs, of which 16
have been classed as major reservoirs. The estimated annual volume of water resources in the Basin
is about 85.4 billion m3, consisting of 62.1 billion m3 of surface water and 23.3 billion m3 of ground
water.
River pollution is mainly organic (BOD, COD, unionised ammonia), with sections in urban reaches
being more polluted than rural reaches, and pollution in tributaries is more serious than in the
-mainstream reaches. The dry season base-flows in the province are at or near zero, which means there
is little dilution capability for the variety of point and non-point sources of pollution. The mainstream
and tributary reaches are very flat with little dilution capability for much of the year. Environmental
resources are minimal and re-aeration and recovery is minimal in most of the basin.
The Shandong EPBs have established 18 sampling points to monitor the river quality of the Huai
River Basin. Samples are taken during wet and dry seasons. In 1998, two of these 18 sampling points
met Class III Standards, and the remaining sampling points met Class IV Standards. The ocean water
quality assessment indicates that the Yellow Sea has generally good water quality near the proposed
Rizhao ocean outfall from the proposed WwTW.
2.2     HRWPCP Project Components
2.2.1   Component Summary
The goal, objectives and outputs of the Huai River Water Pollution Control Project (HRWPCP) were
discussed in detail in Chapter 1. It is the national goal to have wastewater collection and secondary
treatment facilities constructed in all cities within the Huai River Basin, according to the 1996 WPCP.
Many of the cities in the basin have already been building wastewater collection and treatment
facilities with international and bilateral assistance. The HRWPCP is designed to complement the
overall basin objectives by supplementing these ongoing efforts in the major urban centres of
Shandong Province that have not been addressed by other projects.
Shandong Province is currently proposing four municipal wastewater schemes and one industrial
pollution control sub-component for inclusion in the WB project, All the municipal wastewater
schemes involve improvement and extension of existing sewerage networks and three include new
WwTWs. Most of the sub-components also include operation and maintenance equipment including

laboratory equipment and vehicles. The Rizhao City component also includes construction of sea
outfalls. The industrial pollution control project comprises treatment facilities for wastewater arising
from Chengwu Paper Mill. One of the cities, Ju County, has a WwTW under construction using only
local funding. Hence, this WwTW is outside of this project.
All the sewerage schemes will involve both the interception of existing combined sewage or industrial
wastewater outfalls and provision of first wastewater collection in more recently developed areas of
the cities. Wastewater will be conveyed to WwTWs and will make a major contribution to control of
water pollution in the Huai River Basin, and in the case of Rizhao, control pollution in off-shore
waters and nearby bathing beaches. Table 2.1 and 2.2 shows the project details that are proposed for
the HRWPCP in Shandong Province:

2.2.2     Related Projects
The Ju County WwTW is being constructed with local funds. SIEP has reviewed the project EA for
this WwTW and incorporated the requirements of this EA into the consolidated provincial EA.
2.3       Project Formulation and Development
2.3.1     Project Inventories and Ranking
As described in Chapter 1, the 3H Action Plan, which addresses the overall water quality problems
and priority actions for the Hai, Huai and Huang river basins, is still under review.  Provision of
wastewater collection and treatment facilities in the cities of the Huai river basin is a priority action
item in the Basin Control Plan, and a critical component shown in the 3H Action Plan. The Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) of Water Pollution Control in the Huai River Basin anticipated that much
of the construction of wastewater collection and WwTWs would be completed by the year 2000, but
the programme is running well behind schedule.
Table 2.3 provides a listing of the cities and overall municipal WwTW needs in the Huai River Basin,
as shown in the 3H Action Plan, and the project cities supported by the current HRWPCP in Anhui
and Shandong provinces are highlighted. This table illustrates the enormous backlog of municipal
wastewater treatment needs in the Basin that requires additional funding.

2.3.3    Final Component Selection and EA Categorisation
The HRWPCP was originally formulated as an industrial waste control project, but was re-formulated
due to financial problems associated with the industrial pollution control projects. On November 23,
1998 the World Bank provided formal notification to the Huai River projects that they would not
proceed with appraisal of the industrial control project, and that the HRWPCP would now be
addressing mainly municipal wastewater needs.
The revised HRWPCP project initially covered three provinces, Jiangsu, Anhui and Shandong
provinces. However, in September of 1999, Jiangsu Province decided to drop out of the HRWPCP
and use other funding sources for the province's wastewater facilities.
On June 26, 1999, the World Bank HRWPCP Coordinating Unit in Beijing informed the provinces
that a Category "B" EA would be required, along with a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and
Environmental Maniagement Plan (EMP). Due to the fairly significant resettlement issues, the WB
requested during subsequent missions that the EA should be prepared with full detail similar to a
Category A project, although based on the environmental issues involved normally a "B"
categorisation would have sufficed. The WB also emphasised the following points related to the EA:
Rigorous public disclosure should be carried out;

Shandong Province
*  Significant issues for the EAs included level of WwTW treatment, and the disposal of
WwTW sludge and septage;
*  EA submitted to the World Bank needs to clearly show that all proposed WwTW,
including bilateral and other WwTW for project cities which are outside of the WB
project, meet Chinese regulations;
*  Project component EAs, required by Chinese regulations, would not be required by the
World Bank.
Due to internal reviews and the World Bank review missions of March-April 2000 and July 2000, the
list of approved project components has been reduced to those shown in this EA. Further reductions
could occur after this EA is completed, but this should not affect the conclusions of the report.
2.3.4    Ongoing Activities
The 3H Action Plan, as previously described in detail, has recently been completed and the
fecommendations are currently under review. In addition, DHI is preparing a_basin-wide water
quality model, which should greatly assist-with some of the past confusion on overall basin-wide
loads and potential water quality improvements associated with project implementation.  The
proposed improved water quality monitoring program can provide a better basis for evaluation and
review, and assist with the formulation of better strategic plans for the basin and stream sections.
The WwTW project in Ju County is being implemented to use the sewerage system being
implemented by the HRWPCP.
2.3.5    Future Phases of HRWPCP
Due to the large backlog of water pollution control needs shown in the 3H Action Plan, it is likely that
the HRWPCP will be only the beginning of a long-term investment programme for environmental
infrastructure in the Basin. Future phases of the HRWPCP will benefit from the work contained in
the 3H Action Plan, the DHI water quality modelling work, the improved water quality monitoring
program, and the project preparation work for this project. Some of the priorities that may be
considered are the backlog of municipal and industrial projects, the TVEs and other rural sources
including non-point source pollution, as well as water rights management and other methods to
improve the low-flow problems in the basin.
2.4     Details of Shandong HRWPCP Component Projects
Outline details of the main components of the Shandong project components were shown in Tables
2.1 and 2.2 above. Some of the engineering details quoted in these tables may be expected to change a
little in the course of the detailed design. Such changes are not expected to affect this EA but if radical
changes occur these will be re-evaluated.
The FSRs present detailed discussions on design parameters used in the sewerage design and include
model output and typical drawing details for the proposed sewers. The AC has checked the sewerage

design carried out by the FSR Consultant and local design institutes and has discussed the findings
with the local design institutes.
The institutes responsible for the preliminary design in each city have been given the AC's findings
and are reviewing their designs as part of the preliminary design process. The AC has also checked to
determine whether the proposed pressure mains are optimally sized with respect to design flows. A
number of modifications to proposed sewer pressure main diameters in Rizhao have been discussed
and agreed with DRICSI (Rizhao is the only city with pressure mains).
The Feicheng. Heze and Rizhao and Chengwu Paper Mill FSRs describe the likely influent
wastewater quality and the discharge effluent standard for the WwTW to meet in order to achieve the
project water quality objectives. A number of process options are evaluated in the FSRs. Based on
cost and performance criteria the following processes have been selected:
*  Feicheng and Heze Municipal WwTWs- secondary treatment using the standard oxidation
ditch process;
*  Rizhao Municipal WwTW - primary sedimentation and marine treatment of effluent by
disposal through sea outfall;
:  Chengwu Paper Mill - activated sludge with nutrient removal is recammended for the
treatment of 'white' wastewater. Black liquor treatment (for the effluent from the pulp
preparation process) will comprise evaporation, incineration and soda ash recovery.
The proposed sizes of the municipal WwTWs are also assessed using the wastewater projections
presented in the FSR. The required effluent standard under Chinese regulations is generally a
BOD:SS of 30:30, for secondary treatment of municipal wastewater. Rizhao is being designed for
primary treatment coupled with an ocean outfall in this phase, although SIEP has recommended that
secondary treatment be used for future phases.
The HRWPCP projects will remove approximately 37,145 tons per year of COD from the Huai River
Basin according to SIEP calculations (including the Ju County WwTW being constructed with local
funding.) The 3H Master Plan has provided some preliminary estimates of the total COD loading in
the Basin, and indicated that the 1996 WPCP seriously underestimated overall COD loading. SIEP
has estimated the current COD loading in Shandong Province (including TVEs and nonpoint source
pollution) at 214,000 tons per year, compared with the WPCP goal for Shandong Province of 67,400
tons per year. Regardless of the estimation being used, it can be seen that the HRWPCP projects
provide significant water quality improvement but fall well short of the WPCP goals for the Province.
The AC has reviewed the FSR Consultant's proposals, preparing supplementary analysis to verifying
the FSR Consultant's findings where appropriate. This supplementary analysis included financial and
economic cost effectiveness analysis to confirnm the choice of process and detailed process analysis to
confirm the sizing of the treatment units proposed.
2.4.1    Feicheng
The proposed scheme comprises new sewerage (including both interceptor sewers and wastewater
only sewers), final effluent recycling pipeline and a wastewater treatment works. All works will be

located to serve the established urban areas of Feicheng between the Kang Wang River and the Long
Shan River (Xincheng area).
The proposed sewers will intercept flows from existing combined sewers in the older part of the city
and also link secondary sewers being constructed in the newer urban areas. Wastewater will then be
conveyed to the new treatment works to the west of the city just downstream of the confluence of the
Longshan and Kangwang Rivers ('Kang Hui' River). No pumping stations will be required in the
system.
The treatment works consists of preliminary treatment (screens and grit removal) and secondary
treatment based on the oxidation ditch process with treated effluent discharged to the Kang Hui River.
Sludge produced by the process will be thickened, dewatered to produce a cake and transported to
landfill or used as a fertiliser on forest farmland.
Figure 2.1 shows the sewerage systems of Feicheng as shown in the Chinese EA and Figure 2.2
shows the proposed wastewater facilities in schematic form for the World Bank HRWPCP project.
2.4.2    Heze
The proposed scheme comprises new sewerage including both interceptor sewers and wastewater only
sewers, pump stations and a wastewater treatment works. All works will be located to serve the
established urban areas that presently drain to the Zhao Wang and Zhu Shui Rivers which pass
through Heze.
The proposed sewers will intercept flows from existing combined sewers in the older part of the city
and also link secondary sewers being constructed in the newer urban areas. Wastewater will then be
conveyed to the new treatment works to the east of the city. Four intermediate lift pumping stations
will be required to lift flows into the sewer system.
Figure 2.3 shows the sewerage systems of Heze from the Chinese EA and Figure 2.4 shows the
proposed wastewater facilities in schematic form for the World Bank HRWPCP project.
2.4.3    Rizhao
The proposed scheme comprises new sewerage including both interceptor sewers and wastewater only
sewers, pumping stations, a wastewater treatment works and disposal of treated effluent through sea
outfalls. All works will be located to serve the established urban areas of Rizhao.
The proposed sewers will intercept flows from existing combined sewers in the older part of the city
and also link secondary sewers being constructed in the newer urban areas. Wastewater will then be
conveyed to the to the new treatment works in the south of the city. Three intermediate pumping
stations will be required to transfer flows in the sewer system.
The treatment works consists of preliminary and primary treatment stages with treated effluent
discharged to the Yellow Sea via an outlet pumping station, rising main and twin long sea outfalls,
2.5 km long. Sludge produced by the process will be thickened, de-watered to produce a cake,
stabilised using lime and transported for use as a fertiliser on forest farms,

2.4.4   Ju County
The proposed scheme comprises 15 km of new interceptor sewers (DN500 to DN1200) to serve the
established urban areas of Ju County lying between the Liuqing River and Shu River.
The proposed sewers will intercept flows from existing combined drainage in the older part of the
city. Wastewater will then be conveyed to the to the new treatment works in the south of the city. The
new WwTW is being constructed with local funds and is not part of the HRWPCP. All flows will
gravitate to the WwTW and no pumping stations will be required.
Figure 2.7 shows the sewerage systems of Ju County from the Chinese EA and Figure 2.8 shows the
proposed wastewater facilities in schematic form for the World Bank HRVWPCP project.
2.4.5    Cheng Wu Paper Mill
-Chengwu paper mill lies to the north of Chengwu county, to the east, near Liaoshang Road. The plant
occupies 240,000m2, construction area is 75,000 m2. The geographical location of the plant site is
shown in Fig 2.9.
The Mill uses straw as the raw material to produce some 50,000 tons paper per year. The paper
product is reported to be of high quality and is used for writing and toilet paper. The Mill employs
some 1500 people and has extensive staff accommodation facilities adjacent to the mill. These
accommodation facilities currently discharge partially treated sewage to the Dongyu River. The Mill
currently uses up to 32,000 m3/d of water from its own boreholes for pulp and paper production.
Black liquor created through the pulping process, together with recycled water from the pulp
bleaching and paper manufacturing process is treated using chemically assisted flocculation and pH
correction before being discharged back to the river. Under the project it is proposed to provide
treatment for the black liquor and other wastewater streams produced by the process. The project does
not include any modification to the existing manufacturing processes of the Mill. The treatment for
the black liquor will comprise evaporation, incineration and soda ash recovery. Wastewater from this
process will be combined with wastewater from the bleaching and paper processes and treated in a
new activated sludge treatment plant using nutrient addition. Following completion of these works it
is estimated that the quantity of groundwater abstracted will increase to 22,000 m3/d with the increase
due to the needs of the new ash recovery process.
Figure 2.10 shows the proposed pollution control process of Chengwu Paper Mill, and Figure 2.11
shows the proposed wastewater facilities in schematic form for the World Bank HRWPCP project.
2.4.6    Technical Assistance
New municipal wastewater companies are being set up under the project to operate the sewerage and
wastewater treatment facilities being provided under the project and any existing systems as
appropriate. The World Bank is supporting the development of a needs-orientated IST program
comprising a training schedule, equipment purchase and Technical Assistance support to the new
wastewater companies to encourage sustainable operation, maintenance and growth.

2.5     Cost Estimates for Proposed Projects
2.5.1    General
Project cost estimates were prepared for all HRWPCP components in accordance with World Bank
requirements. The cost estimates have been based on the FSRs prepared by the local design institutes
with subsequent clarifications and minor amendments as necessary. This costing exercise serves to
verify the cost estimates prepared by the local design institutes and provides the basis of the
subsequent financial and economic analysis of the viability of the scheme and the size of the World
Bank loan that will be needed.
Cost estimates for the proposed scheme have been determined using the following data:
* unit rates for common elements of civil works derived specifically for this project;
_ .    *  empirical cost functions for treatment works, previously used on other World Bank
projects in China and calibrated for use on this project; and
~-     -  Chinese assessments of the costs of land acquisition, resettlement and compensation
checked by the design consultants.
2.5.2    Capital Costs
The AC has carried out an independent check of the cost estimates presented in the FSR reports for
each sub-component. In undertaking this check the AC has used an in-house China costing model and
database of project costs derived from previous WB projects in China.
Table 2.5 shows a summary of the total project cost estimates presented in the FSRs, by expenditure
category, together with costs derived by the AC for comparison. Table 2.6 shows the total cost
including contingencies split by project city. Table 2.7 shows the estimated annual cost profile for
the project.
The base cost estimates produced by the AC and FSR Consultant are similar. The AC considers the
base cost estimates to be generally reasonable. However, there are significant differences in total
project costs including contingencies for the Heze and Feicheng schemes. The main reasons for these
differences are as follows:
*  FSR costs include an allowance for design and project preparation costs (approx 3.7% of
physical costs) whereas the AC's cost estimate, in accordance with WB procedures,
excludes these costs;
* FSR costs for Heze and Feicheng assume a pllysicai contingency of only 8% in
accordance with standard Chinese practice for feasibility stage estimates. The AC's
estimate is based on 15%;

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                             Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
*  FSR costs for Feicheng do not include any price contingencies and the allowance for
price contingencies in the Heze FSR is very small;
*  The land acquisition cost in the Heze FSR is overestimated and is not the same as the
amount in the Shandong RAP.
A further point to note in the cost estimates is that the World Bank loan amounts are based on limits
in the SDPC approval documents, confirmed by the Shandong PMO, rather than 50% of Bank funded
expenditure used in Anhui.
The total capital costs derived for the Shandong components are considered to represent an upper
limit suitable for use in further analysis. Once preliminary and detailed designs are completed it may
be possible to refine the costs further and to reduce the allowance for physical contingencies to 10%.
It is expected that, overall, this will result in a lower final cost estimate for most sub-components.
The AC cost estimates have been used in financial and economic analyses.

2.5.3    Operating Costs
Projected operating costs for HIRWPCP projects have been prepared and included in the financial and
economic analysis. Civil and M&E maintenance costs were based on percentages of the base costs
for constructing the works. Power, chemical and sludge transport costs were based on the predicted
performance of the works as determined for the feasibility stage design. Staffing costs were based on
those discussed between the WB and cities during the July 2000 Mission.
2.5.4    Finance and Economics
Detailed economic and financial evaluations of the proposed projects were conducted. The following
provides a summary of the conclusions of these evaluations:
.   The AC has undertaken a financial and economic analysis in real terms 2000 prices at the
sub-component level, using a discounted cash flow approach (completely separate from all
other wastewater developments in the municipality) to determine inter sub-component
comparisons of costs, capacities, AICs etc. using cost and benefit streams specifically
associated with the World Bank funded sub-component. The projects have been found to be
economically and financially viable.

Shandong Province
*   A second financial analysis at the utility or enterprise level, in nominal terms and including
the value of any existing assets, their depreciation and operating costs (which will be
transferred to the new wastewater enterprise or division) has also been undertaken. The
purpose of this analysis is to model the performance of the enterprise so as to determine the
tariff level required to meet its objectives and to meet all debt service requirements. The
affordability of the required tariff from the domestic and other customer point of view has
also been assessed and has been found to be satisfactory.
2.5.5   Institutional Issues
The World Bank has asked the project cities to prepare individual Institutional Development Plans
(IDP) and Action Plans (AP) showing the practical steps to be taken to establish self-financing and
sustainable wastewater utility companies. In addition, the Provincial PMO and the municipal PIUs
have been requested to prepare similar documents for the institutional arrangements during project
implementation. These are being prepared with the assistance of the AC.
The documents are based on the World Bank requirements for IDP/APs and Individual IDP/APs will
be prepared as draft stand-alone documents, which will evolve as the project cycle progresses.
Specific responsibility for regular updating of each document will be identified in the AP.
The draft IDP will detail the arrangements and details presently known, and the draft AP will give
fimeframes for the finalisation of outstanding information. In particular, the timeframes for the legal
establishment of the companies, the human resource requirements, the training needs assessment and
for the terms of reference for TA commissions will be identified.
2.6     Implementation Schedule
An overall implementation program for the current phase of the HRWPCP is shown in Table 2.8,
based on WB appraisal in late 2000. Individual component implementation programmes can be found
in the sub-component PIPs and PPPs.

3.1     Physical Environment
3.1.1    Geographical Location
Shandong is a province located along the sea in China. Its geographical location is: east longitude
114036' to 122043', north latitude 34025' to 3823'. The length from east to west of the province is
over 700 km, and from north to south, over 400 km. Total land area is 156,700 km2, accounts for
about 1.6% of total area of China.
Shandong peninsula protrudes out between the Bohai sea and the Yellow Sea, while inland it borders
from north to south on four provinces: Hebei, Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu.
The basic situation of the geographical location of each sub-project is shown in Table 3.1.

3.1.2    Geology/Soils
There was little detailed information on geological conditions in the project cities but the following
information was obtained from FSRs.
*      Heze City is on a plain that has historically been impacted by Yellow River flood
flows and dike burst. Heze City lies in the downstream area of the Yellow River, it is
in the Yellow River alluvial plain.
*      Rizhao is located in level I rise of No.2 Jionan uplifted zone in neocathaysian. It is
the east extent of Yimeng mountain system. There are hills up and down, plain

scattered, rivers crisscrossed, the whole landforms is high in west and low in east,
facing the sea with the hills for a background. In west the surrounding mountains are
like the billows of the sea, there are plains in front of and behind the hills. In east,
there are few hills and many plains near the sea. Rizhao city's coastline belongs to
relative plain sandy bedrock, the general expanding direction is controlled by the
Qingdao ocean deep structure in the direction of NNE-SSW, and intersects toward the
south to Lanshantou with the Pingshang-Andongwei structure running nearly E-W, so
sharply turning to the south-west, entering Haizhou Bay and southward becoming
plain silty clay coast.  Rizhao City is located in the intersecting zone where
earthquake protection scale 6 and protection scale 7 are met. The WwTW is to be
constructed in the protected zone of scale 6.
*      For Ju County, this area is alluvial plane and the terrain is flat. It is between Shu
River in the east and Liuqing River in the west. The Fulai Mountain is nearby in the
west. The height above sea level is between lOOm and 200m.
The earth structure of Chengwu county area is dustpan sink of Chengwu single break
of Luxi bulge in Huabei break area It is deposit of the forth system from the surface
to 346m under the surface. Under this, separately, it is the third system  of the
Cenozoic Era and the Mesozoic Ear layer. Natural landform in this region is
inundated plain filled by huge deposit. The micro-landforms of the project located
area is slightly sloping land.
In Feicheng, the landforns in this county are of many types, the terrain falls from
northeast to southwest. There are 43 rivers course of large and small mountain
torrents and 96 large hills in the county. Mountain range declines from northeast to
southwest inside the boundary, it is the north part of the west foot of Mountain Tai
range.
3.1.3    Topography
The following sections relate the proposed projects and the surrounding landscapes:
Feicheng
Feicheng is located in the west of the central part of Shandong province, at the western foot of
Taishan Mountain, on the nortlh bank of the Wen river, with geographic coordinates at northern
latitude of 350 53' - 360 19'.  It links with Taian at the east, adjacent to Jinan city in the north,
watching Ningyang across the Wen river to the south, and having common boundaries with Dongping
and Pingyin in the west, with Wenshang county to its southwest.
The floodproof standard for Feicheng is Degree 3, 20 years. The Kangwang and Longshan rivers are
planned to handle the 50-year standard flood, while the branches are planned for the 20-year standard
flood.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                              Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
Heze
Heze City is located in south-western Shandong Province, southeast of the North China Plain and
below the south bank of the Yellow River. The Longitude is 114 48' - 116 24' east and latitude 340
48' - 350 52' north. The Heze City is a plain that has historically been impacted by Yellow River
flood flows and dike burst.
The west is a little higher than the east, the height above sea level is about 55.5m, and the northeast is
44m (Huanghai Sea altitude system).
Rizhao
Rizhao is located between 300 04' 44" and 330 36' 1 1" north latitude, and 119 00' 40" and 1190 39'
33" east longitude. It faces the Yellow Sea in the east, and Linyi city in the west, Qingdao city in the
north, and Lianyungang city across the river to the south. The WwTW is planned to be at the Yellow
Sea Industrial Zone and the site was selected because the site is lower than the city, the site is far from
the urbanised areas, the topography of the site is even and easy to build on, there are few buildings or
residents so resettlement cost is reduced, and it is about 1 km from the Rizhao power plant so the
power supply conditions are good.
The elevation of the treated effluent pond before discharge is set at 5.30m, compared to the average
sea level elevation of 2.74m and historic height of 5.46m. If secondary treatment is added later, the
effluent elevation would be 3.70 m at the outlet from the works.
The outlet pipelines discharging wastewater to the sea from the WwTW are located in the sea area to
the north of Kuishanzui Mountain. The topography of the sea bottom is quite plain with a mean slope
of 1/250 within the -7m isobath. The sea bottom between -7 to -12m isobaths is sharply steeper with
a mean slope of 1/50. However, the sea bottom between -12m isobath is relatively smooth with a
slope of 1/1000. At present, the alluvial silt of underwater bank slope in the area is basically in the
balance state after a long topographic development period. The silty soil is mainly distributed at the
bottom of the coast area at the water depth up to 5m. The sea bottom is sandy at the water depth more
than lOm.
The coastal tide in Rizhao belongs to regular semidiurnal tide. According to records between 1968
and 1992, characteristics of the tide are listed below, based on theoretical low tide level:
*      Highest high water level = 5.65m
*      Lowest low water level = -0.47m
*      Mean high water level = 4.23m
*      Mean tidal range = 3.02m
*      Extreme tidal range = 5.23 m
*      Mean sea level = 2.73m
Ju County
The area is alluvial plain and the terrain is smooth. It inclines from north-east to south-west and the
gradient is 1/1000 maximum. The area is 100-200 m above sea level, crossed by the Shuhe River to
the east and the Fulai Mountain is to the west of the area.

Cheng Wu Paper Mill
The paper mill is located adjacent to the Dong Yu River with the Liaocheng-shangqui highway on the
east side of the site.
The terrain of the paper mill site is generally flat.
3.1.4     Climate and meteorology
The Huai River basin is in the transition between the south and north climate of China. The north of
Shandong Huai River belongs to warm temperate zone with semi-humid seasonal wind; the south
belongs to north subtropical zone with humid seasonal wind. The climate characters are typical
seasonal winds, distinct seasons, warm climate, proper rainfalls, changeable spring, clear autumn,
steady spring rains and strong monsoon rainstorms.
In the Huai river basin, rainfall is not evenly distributed in time and place. The yearly average rainfall
is 600-1400 mm and average evaporating volume is 1211 mm, which in general is high in the south,
along the sea and in the mountains, and low in the north, inland and in the plain. The average rainfall
is 947.6 mm, 60 % in July to September the flood season. Moreover, the yearly rainfall varies 2-6
times from maximum to minimum. Table 3.2 provides a summary of climatic conditions in the
'WPCP project cities.

A similar rainfall pattern is experienced for all project cities with the wet season occurring in July,
August and September and the dry season from October to June. The dry season river flows are highly
correlated to the rainfall patterns, with flows approaching or at zero during the dry season.
The following is some additional detail from Rizhao, at Shijiu Ocean Station:
*       Annual average temperature, 12.8  C
*       Annual average liglhest temperature, 16.1 C
*       Annlual average lowest temperature, 9.8 e C
Extreme highest temperature, 37.5  C (July 8, 1964)
*       Extreme lowest temperature, -13.7  C (Jan 15, 1967)

Max. precipitation per day, 168.1mm
June-August is 57.6% of annual precipitation
Dec-Feb is 5% of annual precipitation
Annual average moderate fog days is 125.7, fog days 37.7 days
*     Annual average relative humidity is 72%
3.1.5    Air Quality
The ambient air quality is generally better in HRWPCP cities than Chinese large urban areas with
some variation due to topography and pollutant source mix, but air quality can still be characterised as
intermittently poor. Relative to the Class II standard of GB3095-1996, TSP, NOx and S02 are the
main pollutants of concem and standards are exceeded for varying parts of the year.
There is some concern that these conditions will cause problems related to odour from the proposed
HRWPCP WwTWs, especially since some existing WwTWs in China have experienced severe odour
problems, usually due to inadequate O&M. This odour potential is more fully discussed in the
impacts and mitigation section. It is expected that proper design and operation of the WwTWs will
greatly reduce odour problems. There are few residences or sensitive receptors in the project areas
and appropriate mitigation measures are proposed.
3.1.6    Noise
All major urban areas in the province have locations that exceed ambient noise standards. Monitoring
of ambient noise levels has been conducted at the proposed project sites, especially pump stations and
WwTWs, and used in detailed noise modelling by the design institute. Details of this modelling and
recommended mitigation measures can be found in Chapters 5 and 7.
3.1.7    Surface and Groundwater Hydrology
The Huai River is one of the five major river systems in China. It originates from Mt.Tongbo in
Tongbo County, Henan Province. It flows through Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu from west to east. In
history, Huai River flowed into the sea. In 1194, the 4th dyke of the Huang River burst, and the flood
overflowed southern to the Huai River. In 1855, the Huang River changed its way passing Lijin of
Tianjin into the sea, As a result, sand blocked the Huai River's entrance to the sea. This diverted the
Huai River towards Sanhe, Gaobao Lake, the Canal and Sanjiangying into Changjiang River.
The mainstream of Huai River covers 1,000 km, and the drop difference is 200m with a slope of 0.2
%o. The upper reaches are above Honghekou and are 364 km long, with 177m slope of 0.5 %o. The
middle reaches are from Honghekou to Sanhe Gate of Hongzhe Lake and are 490 km long, with the
elevation difference of 16m. Under the control of Sanhe Gate, the average slope is only 0.027 %o.
Beneath Hongze Lake to Changjiang is the lower reach, 156 km long with a slope of 0.036 %o.
The Huai River mainstream is not located in Shandong Province, but major tributary reaches are
located within the province. The terrain in Shandong portion of the Huai River Basin is even and poor
il water storage characteristics. In the flood period, the river rises suddenly, overflows easily, while it

'The 1996 WPCP defines target water quality in the river basin in terms of reductions in chemical
oxygen demand (COD), which was selected as the pollutant parameter of control. For planning
purposes, this is considered to be a reasonable assumption for reduction of gross pollution since the
WPCP first targeted industrial pollution with a requirement to have each major industry conform to
the "Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard" (GB8978) by year 1997.
The WPCP listed the principles upon which it will rely as follows:
*    based on the assimilative capacity of the river, acceptable pollution discharges are calculated
and distributed throughout the basin such that water classifications are commensurate with
the beneficial uses of the river reaches;
*    industrial pollution  was  targeted  and  the  policy, paraphrased  as  "closing, ceasing,
forbidding, changing and transferring", was to be strictly enforced;
*    beneficial uses of the rivers are to be protected  against spills and pollution accidents.
Management of riverine infrastructure is to be strengthened and the security of key
beneficial uses such as water supply is to be emphasised;
*    pollution control is to be enhanced by means such as cleaner industrial production and by
the construction of municipal sewage treatment plants;
*    regulatory  system  is to  be reviewed  along  with  enhancement of technical, legal and
scientific management and practice.
The WPCP identified a number of causes for the heavy and increasing pollution in the Huai Basin at
the time of the survey. These were:

Shandong Province
*   rapid development of township and village enterprises which use outdated equipment
discarded by urban industry and operate it without any pollution control. The report states
that the number of such enterprises is rising at a rate greater than the urban industrial growth
rate;
*   with increased urbanisation, industrial development is increasing rapidly, often based on
products from the traditional agricultural base. Such industries often have a low technology
content and little or no pollution control. They are also often only marginally profitable
however they consume large quantities of water and are large polluters of the environment;
*   rapid urbanisation also brings a large increase in domestic sewage pollution;
*   investment in pollution control is inadequate and has historically been less in the Huai Basin
Provinces than the national average. Investment in pollution control has not kept pace with
the GNP output for the basin;
*   seasonal water shortages result in low river flows in the dry seasons and inadequate dilution
of wastewaters entering the system. The Huai Basin has a large requirement for irrigation
water and has more than 4200 manual control structures which, in the dry season store
available flow which is largely wastewater. This has led in the past to frequent downstream
pollution following release of such accumulated water;
.   inadequate environmental protection agency strength and facilities combined with an
inability to enforce standards and compliance requirements.
The 3H Action Plan indicated that significant improvement was made in many of the polluting
industries from 1992 to 1997, but that only 7 of 63 planned municipal WwTWs were constructed
during this period. In addition, the assimilative capacity of the receiving streams during the dry
season is essentially zero, with minimal or no inflow, flat and channelised stream reaches, and
minimal environmental resources.
The assimilative, or "carrying", capacity of any river is a complex function of natural and regulated
water flows, background water quality, water quality alterations through reservoirs and other
regulating structures, added waste loads from human activities (rural and urban) and natural re-
aeration ability. The ability of a river to naturally recover its dissolved oxygen concentration is a
function of its width, depth, gradient, mixing capacity, temperature, light penetration and the length of
reach available for re-aeration. The benthal deposits (quantity and type) also affects the ability of a
river to recover since oxygen-conisuming substances re-solubilise from them and re-enter the stream
flow.
Each river reach has quite specific factors that allow the decay rate of BOD or COD to be estimated.
The assimilative capacity of a river or river reach is therefore very site specific and its calculation
requires good data. The definition of the beneficial use(s) of the river reaches is necessary, with the
assignment to each of a "standard" value for one or more quality parameters. The assimilative
capacity can then be calculated in terms of the mass load of pollutants that can be carried by the river
without loss of the defined beneficial use.
Sufficient and reliable data to perforn calculations of the assimilative capacity of the stream reaches
at the HRWPCP project sites was not available at this time. However, based on the 1996 WPCP and
the 1999 3H Action Plan, one can assume virtually zero assimilative capacity in the dry season for all
project sites.

Shandong Province
Rizhao:
Rivers crisscross the whole of Rizhao Municipality, major rivers are Futong River, Shu River, Wei
River, Liangcheng River these four big water system. Rivers that run into the sea are Futong River,
Liangcheng River, Jufeng River, Xiuzhen River and Longwang River.
There are four reservoirs in Rizhao Jufeng and Maling reservoir are located in Donggang district,
Qianghang reservoir is located in Wulian county, Qingfengling, Shiyang reservoir are in Juxian
county.
Coastal area belongs to regular half-day current, flowing direction of current rotates according to
counter clockwise. The fastest flowing speed when tide rising is 0.86m/s, the fastest flowing speed,
when tide is falling is 0.66m/s.
Major rivers flowing into the sea area in Rizhao are Xiuzhen River. Futong River, Zhuzi River,
Xicheng River etc. They are all seasonal rivers, the rate of flow is large in summer and small in
winter.
Ju. County
Shu River runs across the county in north-south direction, it is the major water system in this district.
Ft comes from southern foot of Yishan hill, runs across Yishi County them into the county. The
watershed area in this county amounts to 1718.4 cm2.
Heze
In the west of Heze city area, large and small river embankments criss-cross, the city-protecting river
which is square inside and circle outside is another suburb of the city. Zhaowang River and Wanfu
River cross as "J" in Heze, and there is Zhushui River runs across direction of east west, these three
rivers from the structure from which organise the city's view.
The Yellow River is on the north border of Heze. On the south of the Yellow River there is Huaihe
River water system, major is Dongyu River, Zhuzhaoxin River these two mainstream. Zhushi River
and Anxing River which are the drainage river courses in south and north planed area in Heze, are
branch streams of Zhuzhaoxin River. The rain runoff and tail water from the Yellow River flow into
Huaihe River through Nansi Lake. Volume of river course runoff in the area is small and they are
seasonal rivers. Zhaowang River is a branch of Anxing River, Zhushui River is the only existing
drainage passage in Heze, and the river course is winding. Wanfu River watershed area is 798km2,
and of Anxing river, 23 8km2.
Chengwu
The wastewater produced by existing and proposed project drains south to Dongyu River (old name is
2
Hongwei River). The area of Dongyu River valley is 539 km , the length in the county is 36 km, it
flows east along Jinxiang County to Yutai County 80 km later, it flow into Dushan lake of Nansi Lake
system in Shanigwanig lou of Yutai County.

Shandong Province
Shallow underground water of the project area comes from rainfall and returning flood water of the
Yellow River. The depth of underground water is slightly different in the two sides of Dongyu River,
water level in the north side in high and average depth of many years is 3.06m; while in the south
side, the water level is lower, and the depth is 4.45m. Bordered by Dongyu River, average depths in
the county differ by 0.4m or so.
There are five water rich areas, the one that is nearest to the county is located on the north of the
county region, and the area is 17km2. Underground water flows first from south and north to the
county area, then flows from west to east, its direction is same as that of surface water.
Water used in this project is deep well water. The plant has own wells. Analysed by hydrology and
geology exploration department, it complies with the requirement of living water and industrial used
water.
Feicheng
There are many rivers in Feicheng. The rivers include in this assessment area is Longshan,
Kangwang, Kanghui, Laocheng River, etc. At present, part of sewage of new city drains to Longshan
-Riyer, others northward to Kangwang River. Longshan River runs across the new city, Longshan and
Kangwang River join in the south of Dongfu village in west of the city. Sewage frQm old city drains
to Laocheng River and Kangwang River, these two rivers join in the north of Dongfu village in west
of the city. Sewage from Wanggua town drains to local ditches which flow south to Kangwang River.
Kangwang River flows west for over 30 km, then join with Kanghui River to become the Hui River in
Houhengyu which lies in the boundary of Pingyin and Feicheng. Hui River flows south to Daqing
River then west to Dongping Lake.
Sewage treated by WwTW will drain to Kangwang River. It is an inland seasonal river which has the
effect of preventing and draining the flood in rain season, it mainly receives wastewater from
manufacturing industries and mining industry in the valley and domestic wastewater. In recent years
because of the industrial development, the underground water is over exploited so that the Kangwang
River loses flow from underground water. In low water season, it is basically a sewage draining river
course for industrial and domestic wastewater. Average flow over many year of Kangwang River is
lower than 3m3/s.
Chapter 4.3 provides detailed information on provincial river systems as well as EPB surface water
quality monitoring data on the surface streams in the HRWPCP cities.
3.1.8    Non-Point Pollution, Agricultural and Urban Runoff
With respect to agricultural non-point source pollution, two factors are of key importance to the
pollution of watercourses; the use of fertiliser for arable farming and the disposal of animal waste.
One pig generates approximately 5 times the waste of a human so this is a significant source of
organic pollutants. In following phases of the HRWPCP the following investigations should be
carried out and a strategy for dealing with these pollution sources developed.
*   Estimates of pollution loads generated within the river basins from fertiliser run-off, animal
wastes and the rural population should be estimated.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                               Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
*   By examination of nutrient balances within the river systems, estimates should be prepared
of the percentage of BOD, N and P washed into the rivers from the rural pollution loads.
These estimates should be compared with data from elsewhere.
*   The estimated loads washed into the rivers should be compared with the loads generated
from urban residential and industrial activities in order to determine the significance of the
non-point discharges.
*   Arable farming practice should be examined to determine means by which fertiliser use can
be reduced and the wash-off of nutrients can be controlled. The economic impacts of such
interventions should be evaluated and compared with the costs of pollution reduction by
urban wastewater treatment.
*   The disposal and reuse practice as applied to animal waste should be studied with a view to
establishing improved practices to minimise wash-off. Again costs should be compared with
alternative urban control alternatives.
*   Recommendations should be prepared for discussion at provincial and state levels for
changes to agricultural practices in order to reduce water pollution in a cost-effective way.
Urban runoff from non-point source pollution is also a significant source of pollutants in the urban
areas of the HRWPCP cities. It will be difficult to develop significant interest in this area, until the
sewerage and point source pollution problems have been addressed and solved over the next few
years. Many of the recommended studies in the previous sections for agricultdral areas can be
,aerformed with slight variation for urban runoff. Chemical fertiliser is less of a concern but transport
issues such as oil and fuel contamination become more of a concern. Until vehicle fuels are
improved, lead pollution can also be a major concern.
3.2     Biological Environment
The individual HRWPCP project component EAs included general information about the flora and
fauna of the Shandong Province and HRWPCP cities. The project areas are a combination of urban
and intensive agricultural areas with no undeveloped land affected. As such, native species of flora
and fauna are few. The polluted levels of the watercourses limit aquatic life to a great degree.
3.2.1    Flora
The rural HRWPCP WwTW sites and project areas contain only crops used for agriculture. There are
no undeveloped areas affected. In the urban areas where sewerage is to be constructed, there is no
native vegetation of any significance.
3.2.2    Fauna
There are only domestic poultry and other farn animals located in the study areas and no wild animals
are located in the vicinity of any HRWPCP projects.
3.2.3    Special Issues
There were no special issues noted in the project areas such as sensitive plant or aquatic species,
wetlands or wildlife habitat, cultural or historic sites except as noted in Section 3,4, or sensitive
receptor groups.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                              Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
3.3     Socio-cultural Environment
3.3.1    Project Area Overview
Shandong province is one of coastal provinces in central China and is located in the east of the Huai
River Basin, which is currently considered a relatively developed province in eastern China. Socio-
economic development varies within the province. Generally, the eastern part of province is richer
than the western part of province.
Social infrastructure related to the project includes the water supply system and, the wastewater
discharge and treatment system. The water supply company in each sub-component is in charge of the
distribution of water to the various types of consumers in the area such as domestic users
(households), commercial users (restaurants, hotels etc.), small industries. Domestic users consume
approximately 30-50% of the total water supplied by the water supply company. Larger industries
generally have their own water supply system and in some cases they also supply domestic water to
employees living in the company premises.
The present sewerage system consists of a combined system to collect sewerage and rainwater. The
existing system is unsatisfactory in some of the old urban areas.
3.3.2    Social and Public Health Issues
Water-borne diseases are reported in the feasibility study reports to account for about 20% of all
diseases in the project areas. Most of the diseases are spread by hand contact, or through the soil,
food or flies. For these diseases, the proper disposal of faeces and personal hygiene practices are most
important. This reinforces the need for the sewerage and treatment facilities.
Water quality data indicates that the Huai River and tributaries frequently have levels of pollutants in
excess of standards set for their intended purpose. Of greater concern to human health is the faecal
contamination of the rivers, and the presence of chemicals from industrial wastewater. Eutrophication
can lead to toxic algal blooms posing an additional threat.
These water quality problems pose not only a potential health risk to the local communities but
present significant environmental threat for the local rivers and marine environment. The public
health and environimental impacts provide justification for providing sewerage and treatment facilities
in Shandong province HRWPCP project cities to protect water sources.
The level of treatment proposed by the project at the WwTWs and associated protection of the
drinking water sources will improve the current situation and provide a more acceptable margin of
safety for drinking water. A "do nothing" situation would see an increase in environmental problems
and degradation of the water sources, with consequential negative hiealth impacts, as well as the
further over-exploitation of groundwater sources in an attempt to avoid usinlg polluted surface water
sources.
The public health condition in the region is very much related to the water quality of the Huai River.
It is expected that water quality improvement will lead to a reduction in the need for and expenditures
on medical care. The existing water quality problem poses not only a potential health risk to the local

communities but presents a significant environmental threat for the local rivers and marine
environment.
Despite the difficulty of measuring the precise health impact of improved water supply and quality,
some benefits can be observed. More abundant water of better quality (resulting from parallel water
treatment improvement programs), improved sanitation and greater awareness of the
water/sanitation/disease chain can lead to a reduction in sickness. Better health in turn diminishes the
social and economic cost of low productivity and human suffering.
The data indicates there are potential health benefits that can be derived from improvements in
drainage and sanitation throughout the project areas in HRWPCP project cities in Shandong province,
and in reducing the risk to the safety of the public water supply. Health improvements gained by the
project will reduce family health costs, which in turn will contribute to poverty reduction for the low
income groups and elderly.
3.4     Areas of Special Designation
Shandong Scientific Research Institute of Environmental Protection (SIEP) attempted to verify that all
pr.oject components in all HRWPCP project cities had no effect on areas of special. designation. They
noted that the local EPBs have approved all individual project components, and they noted that the
local EPBs have the detailed information on sensitive areas under theirjurisdiction. In addition, SIEP
visited the sites of all proposed HRWPCP facilities and verified that the projects will have no effect
on areas of special designation.
3.4.1    Endangered Flora and Fauna
In 1986, the Environmental Protection Committee of the State Council published a "Chinese Rare and
In Severe Danger Protection Plant List". It was subsequently revised in 1987 by NEPA. In addition,
a "State Key Protection Wildlife List" was published and approved by the State Council in 1988.
SIEP consulted local EPBs and scientific research institutes, and found that there are no listed species
in the project area that could be affected by the HRWPCP project construction. Also, none were
found during site visits.
3.4.2    Historic and Cultural Sites
A state law called the "Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Cultural Relics"
was adopted by the 25th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People's Congress
and promulgated by Order No. II of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on
November 19, 1982.
SIEP consulted with the scientific research institutes and found that no protected sites were affected
by HRWPCP components. Also, none were found during site visits.
3.4.3    Parklands or Other Special Sites
There were only a few sensitive areas or receptors noted in any of the HRWPCP project areas such as
parklands, schools, hospitals or others that needed special protection from the proposed HRWPCP

construction or operational impacts.  These have been identified and mainly additional noise
mitigation measures proposed.
According to SIEP, there are no natural reserves in the project areas that will be adversely affected by
the HRWPCP.
3.4.4    Watershed Protection Zones
The national and provincial authorities have made significant strides toward protecting watersheds,
especially those related to municipal water supplies.  Industries are directed away from  these
watershed protection zones and existing polluting industries are given incentives to close and/or
relocate. However, there is enormous competition for the water resources of the province.
There are no identified Watershed Protection Zones in the project cities. SIEP have noted the nearest
downstream water supplies in all project cities and have proposed appropriate mitigation measures to
protect these supplies. The HRWPCP component projects will have positive impacts on these intakes
under normal operating circumstances.
3.4.5    Ocean and Beach Resources
SIEP prepared a detailed ocean water quality assessment at Rizhao in conjunction with the proposed
6cean outfall at the Rizhao WwTW. This assessment is provided in detail in Appendix 2 and
summarised in Section 4.3.5. The various environmental functions of the ocean in this area are
presented in Table 4.27.

4    ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND PROBLEMS
4.1      Water and Environmental Institutional Arrangements
The Constitution of the People's Republic of China (1982) provides the framework for environmental
protection law in China. Article 26 of the Constitution stipulates that the "the State protects and
improves the living environment and the ecological environment, prevents and remedies pollution and
other public hazards." National legislation is comprehensive and appears to cover most areas of
environmental concern. However, the level of enforcement in Shandong, as in the rest of China, is
sometimes less than satisfactory. The Chinese economy continues to grow rapidly and there is often a

Class          Description
I            used for water sources and state nature reserves
II           used for class I protection areas for drinking water sources, protection zones
for valuable fish, spawning grounds of fish and shrimps
III          used for class II protection areas for drinking water sources, general
protection zones for fish and bathing areas
IV           used for general industrial water areas and water recreation areas where no
direct contact with humans occurs
V            used for agricultural water areas and scenic water areas.
Note that multi-purposed water areas are classified according to their highest function. To achieve a
particular water quality class the following ten indices should all meet the target standards for the
class (i.e. 100% compliance) in wet, normal and dry seasons:
*      dissolved oxygen
COD
*      volatile phenol
*      ammonia nitrate
*      cyanide
*      total mercury
total arsenic
total lead
I      chromium (Cr6+)
*      total cadmium.
To achieve a particular water quality class 80% of the remaining indices slhould meet the target
standard in wet, normal and dry seasons. In Shandong Province, the provincial goal is Class IV for
rivers in the project areas. However, due to extremely low flow periods in the dry season, Class V is
the goal for the Shu River reach from Ju County to Xiazhuang, Xhushui River. The ocean protection
level at Rizhao is Marine Quality Standard III (GB3097-82), outside of a 3 square kilometre mixing
zone.
A new Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water, GHZB-1 1999, was issued on July 20,
1999, and became effective on January 1, 2000. This new standard replaced GB3838-88. The revised
parameters of most significance to the HRWPCP wastewater schemes are shown below:

4.1.2    The Provincial Level
Environmental management at the provincial level is performed in accordance with an integrated
system of environmental control from the national to local levels. Figure 4.1 shows the general
relationships of the provincial level EPB in relation to the other levels.
The provincial level EPB can exercise certain powers through the Legal Systems Bureau to assist in
the drafting of legislation and regulations that are produced at the provincial and municipal levels.
According to SIEP, there are no other significant provincial laws that are concerned with water and
wastewater management.
4.1.3    The City and County Level
The City and County level EPBs are mainly involved in monitoring and enforcing standards and
regulations set by the national level (SEPA) or the Provincial EPB. There is, ho-wever, some local
level planning for environmental management such as city-wide master planning which generally
inc6ludes river enhancement work for aesthetics, recreation and tourism. This work includes riverside
parks and walkways.
4.2     Attainment of Goals, Standards, Regulations
China has made the issue of environmental protection one of its fundamental policies for the country's
sustainable development. It is the national goal that the present pollution situation shall be alleviated
so that all the major cities shall be improved in terms of environmental quality by the year 2000. One
of the main policy statements is the so called "three at the same time" which means that planning,
implementing and progressing shall be achieved simultaneously with economic development,
urban/rural development and environmental improvements. Other main policy statements include:
*    prevention combined with mitigation is preferred;
*    pollution shall be mitigated by the one who has generated the pollution (polluter pays).
Concerning water quality, focus is on the following issues:
*    control of industrial discharge of heavy metals, organic and chemical pollutants;
*    introduction of clean technology, updating of production procedures to conserve water
and to increase production efficiency;
*    construction of centralised domestic wastewater treatment works to improve the
environmental quality in urban areas and to reduce the pollution of rivers.
*    improvement of surface water quality by means of river pollution mitigation, water
resource conservation, and enhanced management of the water sector
China has set national policies for environmental protection, and had set the following year-2000
targets for its provinces:

2.   centralised systems for treatment of domestic wastewater shall be constructed in all
large and middle size cities;
3.   with regard to industrial wastewater, the national target for wastewater treated shall be
60% compared to 48% as at present;
4.   the total amount of heavy metals in industrial wastewater shall not exceed and
preferably be less than 1995 levels;
5.   the seriously increasing pollution situation in the Huai River shall be alleviated
significantly;
6.   the quality of surface water in all major cities shall be improved and shall meet
relevant national standards.
Whilst the above objectives are sound there is doubt whether targets can be achieved by the year 2000
(in the Huai River basin as well as much of China). Certainly the HRWPCP will provide a significant
step towards these objectives.
4.2.1    Surface Water Quality
The Huai River mainstream is located far south of Shandong Province, but the tributary reaches are
hydrologically connected to the basin. The Dongping Lake, Nansi Lake and Shu River, which receive
'wastewater from HRWPCP areas, are not directly connected to the main stream of the Huai River.
The Huai Basin in Shandong province involves 7 Municipalities and districts, that is, Zaozhuang,
Jining, Linyi, Taian, Zibo, Rizhao Municipalities and Heze District. These include 42 counties and
smaller districts, giving a Basin area in Shandong of 47,100 kM2, the population in the Basin is over
30,000,000. In this area, there are 26 major rivers. Industry types are various but mainly is light
industry, chemical industry, coal and manufacture of building materials industry
The Shandong streams of the Huai River Basin are classified according to the Environmental Quality
Standard for Surface Waters, National Standard GHZB-1 1999, as follows:
*      Huai Mainstream Target Class III (none in Shandong Province)
*      Other rivers are targeted at Class IV (except Shu River at Ju County)
*      Shu River at Ju County, Class V
The Rizhao ocean area is Marine Quality Standard III, outside of 3 km' mixing zone.
Many of these stream sections may not realistically reach objectives due to the very low dry season
flows. Additional flow augmentation, transfer of agricultural water, and/or downgrading of objectives
during seasonal low-flow periods will all have to be considered in detail.
4.2.2    Groundwater Quality
Little information was available on general groundwater quality in the province, but SIEP performed a
groundwater assessment at the HRWPCP sites. Table 4.5 provides the monitor ing sites, Table 4.6
provides the monitoring parameters, and Table 4.7 provides the results of the monitoring.

4.2.3    Water Supplies, Treatment and Distribution
WTWs in HRWPCP cities generally use groundwater for their water supply sources due to poor
quality and unreliable quantity of surface waters. There are some other communities downstream of
these cities using surface water sources that will benefit directly from the improved water quality in
the surface waters. The improvement in quality of raw water abstracted for potable water will be one
of the significant benefits of such interventions.
There is a general over-exploitation of groundwater in the province from municipal, industrial and
agricultural pumping. This situation will continue and grow in magnitude unless additional surface
water supply sources are provided.
Another factor that greatly affects some WTW performance is the high solids contents of the source
waters at times of wet season flows, for WTWs using surface water as the source water. Solids are
relatively simple to remove but the high raw water solids concentrations, coupled with the use of
somewhat antiquated water treatment technologies cause turbidity problems in finished supplies at
some sites.
The natural and manl-made problems in the raw water used by WTWs in the study area result in many
cases in treated water that fails to meet Chinese stanidards for part of the time. Furthermore, these
standards are somewhat less stringent than those used in most developed countries. Water supplied at
the tap is considered noni-potable in all HRWPCP cities and bottled and boiled water is used for
domestic purposes.

4.2.4    Wastewater Collection and Septic Tanks
Sewerage systems in the project area are usually combined in the older areas and separate in the
newer development areas. The policy in China is to gradually separate existing combined systems
and in several of the cities there are plans for rehabilitation of existing sewerage systems, changing to
separate systems in the process. This process will generally occur as the older city centres are
redeveloped in the future.
Treatment of wastewater starts at the housing blocks where wastewater often passes through a septic
tank before discharge to the public sewer system. This treatment reduces the suspended solids and
also, to a varying degree, the level of BOD and nutrients. If these septic tanks are abandoned after
construction of treatment works, the loading estimates to the WwTW would increase by about 10%
for BOD and 30% for suspended solids if it is assumed that existing tanks are in widespread use and
are working effectively. In practice one finds that the tanks are emptied infrequently, in many cases
once in three years. In practice therefore one would expect the concentrations of BOD and SS to rise
by only small amounts.
Wastewater collection has been steadily improving in the area, considering that open stormwater
-drains were widely used in most areas until a few years ago. Urban areas have required the use of
septic tanks in homes and other buildings for many years with the overflow to the-combined sewer
systems. The early sewerage was usually a combined system that conveyed stormwater plus sanitary
wastewater. The new areas of the cities are being built with separated sewer systems to keep
stormwater away from the sanitary wastewater. However, the use of septic tanks is still usually
required since few central WwTWs have yet been constructed.
There is no common timetable for the construction of separate sewers, WwTWs and the elimination
of septic tanks. There is a provincial goal that all medium cities and larger should have WwTWs
constructed by the year 2000, but this is a rather unattainable target, given the immensity of the task
and limited funding. It would appear that many septic tanks will continue to be used in the HRWPCP
study area for at least another decade.
4.2.5    Wastewater Discharges - Domestic
Jinan and Zhibuo completed the first major WwTWs in Shandong province within the past few years,
and many other projects are currently under design, construction or initial commissioning. There is,
therefore, little experience with WwTW  operation and performance. Experience in other parts of
China indicate that operation and maintenance of WwTWs can be problematic due to operational
inexperience and a local desire to save on operation costs, especially power and chemicals.
The problems at similar WwTWs in China provide an added level of "need" for the HRWPCP
wastewater facilities to adequately design and operate facilities, have enforcement mechanisms in
place for the provincial EPB to ensure adequate operations, and also train a cadre of professionals in
the proper operation and maintenance of central WwTWs for the province.

4.2.6    Wastewater Discharges - Industrial and NPS Pollution
Wastewater reports and loadings contained in the feasibility reports and SIEP EA indicate that
modern and clean technology industries are not the rule in Shandong Province. Many of the older
factories, especially State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are being closed down for both economic and
environmental reasons, especially to meet the goals of pollution load reduction in the Basin plan.
According to the investigation of industrial pollution source in the service area of the 4 WwTWs, it is
known that wastewater treatment facilities have been built in each industrial enterprise within "Ninth-
five Action of Reaching the Standard in Huai River Basin".
It is uneconomical to treat the industrial wastewater separately for the enterprises with little industrial
wastewater drainage quantity. After the new WwTW is constructed and begins to operate, industrial
wastewater must be pre-treated to reach Wastewater Quality Standard for Discharge to City Sewers
(GJ18-86), then it will be allowed to enter the WwTW to be treated with other wastewater sources.
There is a WwTW in Huayuan paper mill of Ju county. Wastewater will be released directly and
should not enter the Ju county WwTW after being treated to reach the standard. The discharge
quantity of Huayuan paper mill is 17,800 m3/d with density of drained water of 395 mg/l (data from
environmental assessment statement of mill extension project).
Drainage of Heze paper mill has been included in the service area of the proposed Heze WwTW.
Major accepting water body of Heze is Zhushui River. According to the monitoring data in this
environmental assessment, the value of COD is 477 to 1319 mg/I, 117 to 412 mg/l of BOD5, 14.2 to
19.8 mg/L of total N, and 5.37 to 6.66 mg/L of TP. The results show that quantity of organic matters
in the water is unstable, and concentration of COD is high. The reason is that average concentration of
COD in waste outlet of Heze paper mill is 2300 mg/L and quantity of wastewater amounts to
10000-12000m3/d. In addition, concentration of COD in discharged water is unstable. Although a
WwTW has been built in paper mill, the discharge water quality does not attain the standard yet and
this has significant impact on city wastewater quality.
The SIEP assessment analysed the Heze paper mill according to the following two conditions:
1. When the quality of wastewater from Heze paper mill exceeds the standard greatly
(At present situation monitoring):
Under this condition, large amount of organic wastewater with high concentration from
Heze paper mill will enter the WwTW, causing the treatment load to increase and
treatment efficiency to decrease. Final wastewater quality of WwTW discharge cannot
reach the standard. In addition, pH value of wastewater from paper mill is usually higher
thani the permitted scope in biochemical treatment of 6-10. The higher pH value will
affect biology treatment. Therefore when wastewater from paper mill is seriously over
the standard, it shouldn't be discharged to the WwTW.
2. When the wastewater from Heze paper mill meets the requirement of CJ18-86
standard .(major pollutants index CODcr less than 500mg/L):

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                             Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
When the wastewater from paper mill is treated to better condition in the industrial
WwTW, the discharged tail water can still reach grade 2 standard of GB8978-1996 from
the respect of the whole plant although the wastewater is difficult to treat in biochemical
method and the pollutants-eliminating rate is low. When discharged water from paper
mill has reached CJ18-86 standard, it means the treatment instrument of the paper mill
itself is complete. If the management is strengthened, its discharged water can completely
reach the Discharge Standard of Water Pollutant for Paper Industry. It is then not
economical to discharge it to city WwTW again (the paper mill must pay related fees).
Moreover, the quantity of wastewater from  the mill changed greatly, which will
potentially threaten the stability of reaching standard of the discharged water for the
WwTW. Therefore, SIEP suggested that wastewater from Heze mill should be treated by
the mill itself and then discharged separately after reaching standard.

Heze and Feicheng are presented.

4.2.7     Industrial Discharges to Sewerage Systems
A  limited review  of the major industries in the project cities indicates that organic wastes are very
predominant, and industrial processes using heavy metals or toxic substances are not the rule in the
project cities. However, even small neighbourhood industries such as plating shops discharging to
sewers can cause dangerous problems in the collection systems, the wastewater treatment process, and
the resulting sludge quality. A rigorous approach to industrial monitoring and pre-treatment is a
necessity for any comprehensive municipal wastewater scheme.
From the 3H Action plan, Tables 4.10 and 4.11 below present data on the number and pollution load
status of industries in the Huai River Basin, and their distribution in regard to each administrative
district.

As indicated in Table 4.12, paper industries are evidently the most polluting. The paper industry
produces the greatest volume of wastewater, the greatest absolute COD load, and COD load per
industry, as well as being the most abundant type of industry in the basin.

In the Huai Basin, the brewing industry (beer brewery and alcohol distillation) is ranked second
polluter in the basin, with the food industry ranked third and the chemical industry ranked forth (in
terms of COD load). See Table 4.13.

The brewing and food industries are representative of the industry types in the basin; low capital
investment, highly labour intensive and highly polluting. The paper, brewing and food industry
categories together form 76.1% of total industrial COD load, 45.2% of total industrial wastewater
volume and 40.6% of total industry numbers in the Huai River Basin. Priority attention should be paid
to the paper and brewing industries, as in each individual enterprise pollution control measures may
gain a much higher environmental benefit than for other categories.
There are significant industrial waste contributions to the proposed HRWPCP WwTWs and the staff
of these WwTWs will require training in the testing of raw sewage quality and the detection of wastes
that could cause problems in the operations of the WwTWs. It will be particularly important to
eliminate any potential sources of hazardous or toxic wastes that are both difficult to handle in the
WwTWs, but also could present a safety hazard to sewer and sewage treatment workers. As seen in
the previous tables, organic wastes predominate and hazardous materials and heavy metals would be
expected to be a minor problem, but rigorous pre-treatment and monitoring will be required.
Table 4.14 shows the major industrial inputs in the Shandong HRWPCP project cities, and Table
4.15 provides standards for industrial discharges to sewerage systems.

Only limited data was presented on agricultural and urban pollution but the 3H Action Plan has
indicated that rural sources, including non-point source pollution is likely to cause a greater pollutant
load to the Basin than the point sources (municipal sewage and industrial wastewater.)
4.2.8    Sludge Disposal for Septic Tanks and WwTW
Nightsoil and septic tank sludge have historically been applied directly to agricultural land. The
public health problems associated with these practices, in direct contact as well as potential crop
contamination, have been well documented. Local officials are moving to eliminate these practices as
soon as practicable. The construction of WwTW and the production of sludge from WwTWs is a
relatively new issue in the province. In many cases, sludge from WwTWs in China has been applied
directly to agricultural land, either with or without dewatering.
Based on the assumptions of low heavy metal content in the influent wastewater and a well operated
extended aeration WwTW, sludge from the HRWPCP municipal WwTWs had been approved for land
application by the provincial EA. However, due to a lack of sludge disinfection facilities in the project
and a lack of a market for composted sludge, SIEP has modified the EA to require landfilling of the
WwTW sludge from Feicheng and Heze. SIEP have provided certificates from the local landfills that
they are willing to accept the WwTW sludge, and they have certified that the landfills are engineered
with leachate control facilities. They have also verified the acceptability of sludge hauling routes. At
Rizhao, facilities for dewatering and lime stabilisation of the primary sludge have been included in the
proposed WwTW design. Lime stabilised sludge will then be transported 20 km to a forest farm to be
used as soil conditioner. All sludge types produced by the Chengwu Paper Mill will be transported to
nearby landfills for disposal. Details of the landfills are provided in the FSRs and sub-component EA.
The landfills are in stable geological conditions (clay) and are considered acceptable.
4.2.9    Solid Waste Collection and Disposal
In general, the urban core areas appear to have fairly good MSW collection systems, but the present
disposal practice is hardly adequate. Areas of lesser density, surrounding the urban core areas, suffer
from random dumping and inadequate collection and disposal. Surface water systems in the province,
like most areas of China, suffer from significant solid waste accumLtlation since rainwater runoff
conveys much of this MSW into nearly streams and watercourses.
4.2.10   Health and Safety
The health statistics for some urban areas in the HRWPCP area indicate that the incidence rate for
infectious and parasitic diseases in Shandong is up to double the national average of about 180 per

1 00,000. This indicates that infectious diseases, many of which originate from water related diseases,
are a key issue for the province both in the present and future.
4.3       River Systems and Ocean
The Huai River Basin, covering the provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong, has a drainage
area of 270,000 km2 and a population of 154 million. The national policy is to clean up the Huai
River to Class III by the year 2000, while the tributaries are to reach Class IV by 2000 (with some
exceptions). Although this is an important goal, it is impossible to attain for most stream sections in
the basin, especially during critical seasonal low-flow periods.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                                    Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
Each index of Lingyangqiao section (2#) in Shu river and Xixinhe section (5#) in Xixin river does not
exceed standard value, which shows that water quality of Shu river in Ju county and Xixin river are
improving. The section of Dingjiaocun (6#) shows the pollution situation of Shu river after accepting
the water from Yuni river, the value of CODCr and BOD5 exceeds standard value with 2.78 and 0.77
times respectively, which indicates that the main cause of pollution of Shu river in Ju county is the
wastewater from Yuni river.
The pH value in each monitoring section of Zhushui river does not exceed the standard value.
However, the value of CODcr and BOD5 exceeds the standard value seriously (by 28.08 and 39.15
times respectively) due to the wastewater from Heze papermaking mill.
The pH value in each monitoring section of Kangwang river does not exceed the standard value. The
value of CODC, and BOD5 exceeds the standard value except Wuming section (5#). In the low reaches
of Kangwang river, the value of CODCr and BOD5 of the 7# section exceeds the standard value (by
2.15 and 4.73 times, respectively).
The value of CODC, and BOD5 of upper reaches of Dongyu river (1#) meets category IV of Surface
Water Quality Standard except pH value exceeding the standard value. During the period of
monitoring, the value of CODcr and BOD5 exceeds the standard value (by 41.37-and 63.17 times,
respectively) after the wastewater from Chengwu papermaking mill enters. That is to say the water
body has been polluted seriously.
4.3.2    Surface Water Quality Data and Assessment, Control Sections
SIEP also reviewed the current water quality conditions of the WPCP monitoring control sections
within Shandong Province for rivers concerning each subproject, including routine sections and total
control sections. Details are shown in Table 4.20 and Figure 4.6.

From Table 4.24, it is predicted that the COD quantity discharged to the river near the proposed
WwTWs will be greatly reduced by the HRWPCP projects. The low water period of Zhushui River
can reach standard of class V and the flood period of Kangwang River can reach class IV.
But for each water period the other rivers cannot reach the requirement of class V, although they can
satisfy the water quality requirement of farmland irrigation. (water farming: COD<200 g/l, dry
farming: COD<300 g/l, vegetable COD<150mg/L). Refer to Table 4.25.

Shandong Province
From Table 4.26, the control section's water quality of related river can be improved in different
degrees after each municipal WwTW and Chengwu sub-projects are finished. Especially after alkali
recovery and white wastewater treatment plant of Chengwu paper mill has been put into operation, the
mill's wastewater effluent can reach the standards completely. It improves the water quality of
Dongyu River (Xuzhai brake section) significantly. In the second place, water quality of Shu River
(Xiazhuang section) and Zhuzhaoxin River (Yulou section) can be improved in different degree after
finishing both the WwTW associated with the sewerage of Ju county and Heze WwTW. Because of
the longer distance (approximate 1OOkm) between Feicheng WwTW and Wangtai bridge section of
Daqing River and the smaller proportion of water quantity treated by WwTW flowing to Daqing
River, improvements to the water quality of Daqing River are more limited after finishing the project.
4.3.5    Ocean Water Quality Assessment, Rizhao
Wastewater treated by Rizhao wastewater treatment plant is drained into Yellow Sea through
discharge pipeline near Jianshazui. SIEP performed a detailed ocean water quality assessment, details
of which are attached as Appendix 2 of this EA.
According to Environmental Function Area Division of Coastal Area in Shandong Province, Rizhao
-coastal area is divided into 9 environmental function areas. They are salt industry and cultivating
industry area of Rizhao, tourism recreation and entertainment area of Rizhao, -culturing area of
Rizhao, port area of Rizhao Port, Kuishanzui mixing area of Rizhao, ocean organisms natural
protection area of Rizhao, salt industry and culturing area of Rizhao, Lanshan port and industry area
of Rizhao, Qiansandao ocean organisms natural protection area of Rizhao. Table 4.27 provides the
coastal environmental function areas near Rizhao, and resulting water quality control target. The
ocean outfall discharge area proposed for Rizhao is Class III.

*      In the sea area near the six wastewater draining outfalls, water particle's migrating
average maximumn distance is in the range of 4.14-4.16km. Tidal current ellipse has a
bigger ellipticity, the mixing process of wastewater and the seawater around is
adequate, and the wastewater can be diluted quickly.
*      The water particle migrates to the mid sea basically, and does not obviously impact
the water quality of the port area.
*      The particles discharged during some tidal period times will approach the shore south
of Kuishanzui. A part of particles enter the port area, but the particles entering the
port area and approaching the shore are all diluted for five tidal periods, with lower
concentration, so they do not bring unfavourable impact to related area.
*      A 2.5 km ocean outfall was found to be a superior choice from optimization and cost
effectiveness analyses.
*      Marine Water Quality Standards, Class III, can be met at the proposed outfall
location, except for 3 square kilometre mixing zone. However, SIEP analyses indicate
that future phases of the Rizhao WwTW should adopt secondary treatment rather than
primary treatment in order to maintain water quality standards outside of this mixing
zone.
4.3.6    Summary
The surface water systems in Shandong Province will be unlikely to meet the Class III or Class IV
WPCP targets during the dry season for the foreseeable future. There is very little assimilative
capacity in these surface waters due to inflows approaching zero in the dry season, channelised stream
sections with very flat slopes, and minimal environmental resources. However, SIEP water quality
assessments indicate significant water quality improvement from implementation of the HRWPCP
projects. The major industrial dischargers have reduced their basin wide COD impacts to a great
extent, but expanding urbanisation in the cities is causing increasing domestic sewage impacts, while
construction of proposed WwTWs lags far behind the WPCP planned schedule.
In addition, the 3H Action Plan indicates that the overall COD loading in the basin may be over twice
the WPCP estimates, due to TVEs, non-point source pollution and other miscellaneous sources.
Unless ways can be found to increase the dry season base flows there is little hope of meeting river
water quality objectives for much of the length of the rivers in the Huai River Basin.
Since the beginning of 1996, Shandong province has carried out section monitoring of total quantity
control on the water pollutant in emphasized river valley, and there are 21 sections in Huai River
Basin admninistrated by Shandong. From monitoring data of water quality in recent three years, there
are 7 sections that have reached or approached to Category V surface water standard in 1998,
accounting for 28.5%. Comparing with 1997, there are 18 sections in which water quality has been
improved accounting for 85.7%, Of which, there are 10 sections whose decreasing range is over 50%.
In the sections of Qunle bridge in Chenglhe Yin gutter in Sihe River, Xuqian floodgate in Dongyu
River, rice beach in Xizhi River, Daxing bridge in Xinchu River east side of Picang flood separating

road West Pianhong, Guan bridge et al, their COD density have all been decreased greatly. The main
reason is: most important pollution sources have achieved discharge standards; while the enterprise
that can't reach the standard have been stopped. Though the water quality has improved obviously,
part of rivers, especially those flowing to Nansi Lake, have been polluted heavily. There are 11 rivers
whose COD density monitored in 1998 was over 100 mg /L and 9 of these rivers flow to Nansi Lake.
At present, water quality in Huai River Basin administrated by Shandong province has improved
obviously. But, there is long distance to go in achieving the goal of clear water in the Huai Basin by
2000. Major remaining problems are:
1. In those enterprises that have been checked and accepted, pollution treatment
plants run unevenly because treatment technical technology is bad or cost for
running is high. In those enterprises where treatment project has been finished, it
runs debugging for long period and can't discharge stably after reaching the
standard.
2. Constructing speed of city WwTWs is slow. Many city WwTWs included in the
Huai Basin water pollution prevention and treatment plan, have not finished
constructing on time.
3. Because there is no runoff or the quantity of runoff is little in dry season period in
Huai River Basin administrated by Shandong, even if the enterprise reaches
discharge standards, and water quality of river improves, it can't reach planned
standard in dry season low flow period. For most rivers, there is only water for
industry and living in low flow period, its silt content is normally 200-400mg/L,
and because the riverbed has been deposited for many years, pollution accidents
may be formed in time of opening the floodgate to release water or during flood
season as pollution is released from the sediments.
The proposed ocean outfall at the Rizhao WwTW for primary treated wastewater effluent has been
found to be properly designed, and causing no unsatisfactory impacts to the ocean or port resources.
However, SIEP has recommended that secondary treatment be installed for any future phases of the
Rizhao WwTW to protect ocean resources.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                            Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
5       DETERMINATION OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED
PROJECT
The HRWPCP in Shandong Province will involve the implementation of municipal wastewater
collection and treatment programs in three cities (Heze, Feicheng and Rizhao) and collection facilities
only in Ju County. The 5~ component project in Shandong involves an industrial wastewater program at
Chengwu paper mill. In China, as elsewhere in the world, these types of scheme normally create a
common series of impacts, both positive and negative.
*      In Section 5.1, the typical positive and negative impacts are presented for the
construction and operation of water pollution control projects.
*      In Section 5.2, the positive impacts of the individual project components are
summarised.
*      In Section 5.3, the short-term negative impacts arising from construction are presented
for each of the project components.
*      In Section 5.4, the potential longer-term impacts that can occur during operation are
presented for each scheme.
In Chapter 7, a series of generic mitigation measures, to counteract the adverse impacts identified, are
presented. Also presented are proposals for the monitoring of the implementation of the generic
mitigation measures and details of the organisations responsible. These are presented as schedules in
tabular form.
Also included in Chapter 7, are proposals for the long term monitoring of the success of the project. The
main Performance Indicator is the quality of the river waters and sampling and analytical programmes
are proposed. Other Performance Indicators to be monitored relate to the effective operation of the
component engineering works.
5.1     Typical Impacts of Water Pollution Control Projects
5.1.1    Positive Impacts
The normal positive impacts one expects for water pollution control schemes, which also relate to the
HRWPCP schemes are summarised below:
*      Connection of household foul drains to effective, enclosed sewers creates a range of
benefits:
1. Contact with sanitary waste within the home is reduced
2. Contact with infectious waste in open sewers/drains/streams is reduced.
3. Odour problems are reduced or eliminated.
4. Contamination of foodstuffs is reduced.
5. The general environment of those living close to open drains is improved.
6. Amenity is improved and exposure to harmful materials is reduced, particularly
or the more vulnerable members of the communities (e.g. the young and the old.)
7. The handling of nightsoil is eliminated. This is believed to be one of the major
sources of illness from waterborne diseases.
*      The discharge of treated or untreated wastewater at a point downstream of the project
area removes the possibility of access by project area citizens to the harmful
constituents of the wastewater.

Shandong Province
The biological treatment of wastewater before discharge to adjacent surface waters
has many benefits:
I . The concentration of pathogenic organisms in the wastewater is greatly reduced.
2. The concentrations of BOD and ammonia are reduced thereby reducing the oxygen
demand in rivers and making the rivers "healthier."
3. The Suspended Solids content of the wastewater is reduced and therefore the
general appearance and amenity value of the river can be improved.
4. Ammonia is toxic to fish and therefore the removal of ammonia encourages fishing
and fishery development.
5. When removal of nutrients is practised, the risk of algae development in
downstream lakes or slow flowing water is reduced.
*      Good public health facilities have been found worldwide to increase the feeling of
well-being in those served and to create an environment conducive to effective
development, and social and environmental well-being.
5.1.2    Negative Impacts
There are a range of potential negative impacts which arise from the implementation-of water pollution
control projects. These are summarised below:
-.1.3    General
-      The construction and operation of environmental works costs money that must be
repaid by the beneficiaries. It is necessary to ensure that the project can be afforded
and that the public considers the improved services to be worth the price to be paid.
Such checks have been made in the case of the HRWPCP components and these have
been found to be affordable and receiving high degrees of public support.
-      Land has to be acquired for the construction of the project and therefore those at
present using the land must be cared for. Similarly where people are to lose their
homes and/or have to change their jobs, it is necessary to ensure that satisfactory
arrangements are made for those affected. For the HRWPCP, all of those who will be
affected by the construction of the component projects have been identified and
compensation has been planned in detail. These plans are covered in a "Resettlement
Action Plan" which is being prepared in tandem with this EA. It is worth noting that
in China the means and levels of compensation paid are laid down under State laws
and directives and the terms are widely accepted as generous. So much so that
problems are frequently experienced where people try to illegally move into an area
immediately prior to the development of a scheme in order to take advantage of the
generous compensation. Compensation in China is well-organised and more generous
thani in most other countries.
The construction of civil engineering structures cannot be conducted without creating
a number of negative impacts. These are principally concerned with; noise, dust,
increasing transport, disposal of spoil from excavations and risks to construction staff.
The HRWPCP components will all create such impacts. Mitigation methods are
proposed to limit these impacts to levels that are generally acceptable in China. Such
5-2                                   August 2000

Shandong Province
levels might not be acceptable to all countries in the west since in some cases a
different approach is adopted. It has been considered to be important that the EA
mitigation measures proposed should reflect expectations in China.
*      Spoil disposal creates little problem in China. In most cases there is a demand for
spoil and often spoil from a construction site even can be sold.
Higher risks during construction are experienced in China than in the west. This is
due in part to the greater use of manual labour as opposed to mechanical assistance in
construction. For the HRWPCP, where a number of international contracts are likely
to be let, risks are likely to be less than normal.
*      Risks occur mainly due to working in deep excavations and at height. Standard
mitigation measures can be applied to minimise such risks.
*      Standard mitigation measures such as water spraying are effective in controlling dust
on construction sites.
-  *   In sensitive areas construction noise can be limited by reasonable working hours and
the adoption of quiet practices although it appears that, throughout daily life, the
Chinese are less sensitive to excessive noise than those in the west.
Negative impacts particularly related to the construction and operation of wastewater works are as
follows:
Sewerage pipework and channels are installed or constructed below ground. Negative
impacts can arise from dust produced during excavation, the removal of spoil from
the site, the provision of access for site equipment and machinery and the hazards of
working below ground level. These impacts are minimised by good engineering
design and the use of sound construction practices.
WwTW construction has similar negative impacts including; noise, dust, interference
of transport by site equipment, and the hazards referred to above of working in deep
excavations or at height.
Adverse operational aspects of wastewater treatment are commonly:
o  Excessive noise
o  Unacceptable odour generation
o  Health and aesthetic impacts associated with the disposal of sludge
o  The adverse effects on treatment performance that can be created by the
disposal of toxic industrial discharges to the sewers.
Ocean outfalls constructed to dispose of WwTW  effluent can cause problems in
recreational  areas,  with  adjacent  fishery  resources  including   potential
bioaccumulation in shellfish, and general aesthetic problems during operational
problems and/or specific tidal circumstances.

Shandong Province
*      Industrial paper mill effluents can cause significant organic loading to the receiving
streams if the WwTW are not operated properly.
The above generic impacts are relevant to the HRWPCP components but as elsewhere the adverse
impacts can all be minimised by good design and construction practice, and the application of specific
mitigation measures, as have been detailed case by case in Chapter 7.
5.2     Positive Impacts of the Specific HRWPCP Components
5.2.1    Raising the Output of Agricultural, Fish and Livestock Production
It is anticipated that following the commissioning of the new WwTWs, the water quality in the rivers
being used for irrigation, fishing and livestock production downstream of the inland project
components will improve.
It is anticipated that following the commissioning of the new sewers and WwTW in Rizhao, the water
quality in the rivers being used for irrigation, fishing and livestock production within the urban
boundaries of Rizhao will improve. Further improvements could be expected to fisheries immediately
offshore of Rizhao in the Yellow Sea.
Productivity for all project components is therefore likely to increase through time as will the value of
the production output. However, the extent of further improvement in productivity is linked to related
pollution control programs for industrial and non-point sources.
5.2.2   Increased Domestic Output Due to Improved Water Resources
The goals of the HRWPCP are to restore the Huai River mainstream to Class III, and the tributary
streams to Class IV (with some exceptions). As has been outlined previously in the EA, there are a
wide variety of point and non-point sources of pollution in the basin that will need to be controlled to
meet these goals, and compliance during the dry season low-flows will remain a problem even when
these sources have been controlled. As such, it will be unlikely that the surface streams will be able to
be used reliably for additional water supply sources in the near future. However, water is a very
scarce resource and any improvement in water quality resulting from implementation of the HRWPCP
components will undoubtedly result in improved economic activity in the cities and downstream
communities.
The principal benefits associated improved water resources with each sub-component are shown in
Table 5.1:
5-4                                 August 2000

HRWPCP
Component Improved Water Resources for HRWPCP Projects
Feicheng    The sub-component will contribute to improvement in the quality of water in the
various water bodies in the city, which are currently heavily polluted. This improved
surface water situation will create the potential for increased economic activity in
Feicheng due to the improved environment and will reduce pollution of groundwater
water supply sources caused by polluted surface water. Treated effluent will also be
used for river flow augmentation in the town, improving the flow characteristics of
the urban rivers (which will dry up during the dry season once existing sewer outfalls
are intercepted by the project).
Heze        The sub-component will contribute to improvement in the quality of water in the
various water bodies in the city, which are currently heavily polluted. This improved
surface water situation will create the potential for increased economic activity in
Heze due to the improved environment and will reduce pollution of groundwater
water supply sources caused by polluted surface water.
Rizhao      The sub-component will contribute to improvement in the quality of water in the
various water bodies in the city, which are currently heavily polluted. This improved
surface water situation will create the potential for increased economic activity in
Rizhao due to the improved environment.
Ju County   The sub-component will contribute to improvement in the quality of water in the
various water bodies in the city, which are currently heavily polluted. This improved
surface water situation will create the potential for increased economic activity in Ju
County due to the improved environment and will reduce pollution of groundwater
water supply sources caused by polluted surface water.
Cheng Wu   The sub-component will contribute to improvement in the quality of water in the
Paper Mill  various water bodies in the area. This improved surface water situation will create the
potential for increased economic activity downstream due to the improved
environment.
5.2.3    Public Health Improvements
It is estimated that around 20% of diseases in all HRWPCP project cities are water borne. The sub-
component projects are expected to contribute to a significant reduction in water borne healtl
problems. This will reduce the cost of medical care and increase output as fewer employees will fall
sick each year.
5.2.4   Increased Revenue From Tourism
The principal benefits associated increased tourism with each sub-component are shown in Table 5.2:
5-5                                 August 2000

Component Increased Tourism for HRWPCP Project
Feicheng     Improvement of the quality of the water bodies within the city will further add to the
appeal of Feicheng as a destination for tourists and other visitors. Revenue from
tourism is therefore expected to rise as a direct result of the sub-component.
Heze         Improvement of the quality of the water bodies within the city will further add to the
appeal of Heze as a destination for tourists and other visitors. Revenue from tourism
is therefore expected to rise as a direct result of the sub-component.
Rizhao       Improvement of the quality of the water bodies and bathing beaches within the city
will further add to the appeal of Rizhao as a destination for tourists and other visitors.
Revenue from tourism is therefore expected to rise as a direct result of the sub-
component. In particular, Rizhao is a popular seaside resort and the project will help
safeguard cleanliness of tourist beaches.
Ju County   Improvement of the quality of the water bodies within the city will further add to the
appeal of Ju County as a destination for tourists and other visitors. Revenue from
tourism is therefore expected to rise as a direct result of the sub-component.
Cheng Wu   Chengwu Paper Mill is not a destination for tourists. Any beneficial tourism impacts
Paper Mill  will be in terms of increased recreation use of river sections downstream of the Mill.
5.2.5   Increased Real Estate Values
Land values and rents are expected to increase due to improvements in the local environment as well
as the potential for increased economic activity arising from the possibility of utilising the local
surface water as a water resource.
5.2.6   Improved Surface Water Quality, IRWPCP Cities and Basin
The HRWPCP project cities will all benefit from improved surface water quality after implementation
of the HRWPCP and construction of sewerage, WwTWs and industrial wastewater facilities. For the
HRWPCP, the cities of Feicheng and Heze will benefit directly from the WwTW construction funded
by the HRWPCP, and the surface waters in the urban areas of Rizhao upstream of the ocean will also
be improved. The improved water quality treatment system at the Chengwu Paper Mill will have
positive impacts.
Under the overall Huai Basin WPCP, Shandong Province has established a Total Volume Control
Plan and operating scheme of total pollutant in 'Huaihe Basin waterbody which is administrated by
Shandong' according to the WPCP targets and its actual situation. There are 26 control sections and
border sections in the downstream of major rivers in the cities and districts. The Total Volume control
Sections related to this project are slhown in Table 5.3.

From Table 5.5, the discharge volume of CODcr of each project after it is treated can all satisfy the
Chinese total volume control standard. In addition, volume of SO2 and fume from oil-burning boiler
in Heze sewage treatment plant, boiler in Chengwu paper mill and alkali recovering boiler are all
satisfy the total volume control standard set by local governments.
According to the maximum permitted discharged volume of each total volume control section in
Table 5.5, discharged volume of COD before the HRWPCP is implemented and the distance between
sewage discharged site and the section, without the HRWPCP, discharged volume of total volume
control section in the related rivers will all exceed the standard. And, COD volume that enters into the
river in 2000 will not satisfy the permitted volume either.
After the HRWPCP is implemented, volume of COD that enters to related river will satisfy the
requirement of WPCP goals in year 2000. Its decreased volume to the needed decreased volume in
year 2000 is a maximum of 4.82 and a minimum of 1.92. After the project is implemented, decreased
COD volume when operating in full load condition accounts for 46.9% of all reduced COD volume
needed to satisfy total volume control target in year 2000 in Huaihe valley (not including Rizhao and
Feicheng project). The construction of the project will have great effect on the realising of total
volume control target in Huaihe valley administrated by Shandong.
5.2.7    Additional Potential Benefits
Implementation of the HRWPCP components is likely to result in additional benefits, including:
*      Reduced risk of groundwater contamination in the service areas.
*      The impact of making realistic charges for wastewater services, should help to
encourage waste minimisation at source, and intemalise the costs of pollution control.
*      Amenity benefits to the population of project cities are likely to accrue as the quality
of the adjacent rivers improve. This could include use of the river for recreational
purposes and the development of riverside walks and parks for public use.
5.2.8    Summary of Project Positive Impacts
The HRWPCP positive benefits listed in the previous sections will be great assets to the cities affected
and to Shandong Province in general. In the following sections, potential construction phase and
operational phase impacts are identified. There are no significant environmental problems identified
in either phase. Compared with the positive benefits, these potential negative impacts are minor and
easily mitigated. Detailed mitigation and monitoring strategies should alleviate these concerns.
5.3     Potential Short Term Construction Impacts
The HRWPCP projects could cause a variety of short-term construction impacts that must be
monitored and mitigated during the construction period. These construction impacts have been sorted
according to their geographic location within the overall project scheme. In Chapter 7, for each
identified potential impact, a corresponding mitigation method is proposed along with the method of
monitoring and the responsible monitoring agency. The Shandong PMO and city PlUs will have an
ongoinig responsibility to track and report the monitoring work of all the identified agencies, in
addition to their direct monitorinig activities. Although all potential impacts must be accounted for,

the following sections outline the details and more major potential impacts by individual component
project.
5.3.1     Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
Overview
Temporary and permanent land acquisition including some resettlement will occur as a result of the
project. The HRWPCP project cities have prepared Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for each
HRWPCP project component, and these have been consolidated into a provincial project RAP. Table
5.6 summarises the key RAP data.

the project will affect four cities and one industrial area impacting on: (i) 890.48 Mu of land affecting
1055 PAP, of which 408.07 Mu of land will be permanently acquired (658 PAP), and 482.41 Mu of
land will be used temporarily (397 PAP), (ii) 1,272 m2 of housing (23 households including 88 PAP),
and (iii) facilities and attachments which include electricity poles, trees and sandy (unsealed) roads.
No permanent institutional or commercial buildings are affected in any city. A number of temporary
shops, total floor area 13,264 m2 are affected temporarily.
Overall, taking into account all the project affected villages, the average loss of land to each PAP
following re-allocation of land in these villages is not considered significant as in most villages these
are small parcels of land in comparison to total land areas in the village. In a few villages, where the
land loss per capita is significant in percentage terms, the existing plot size is already small and
villagers already rely on other sources of income (for example, the site of the proposed Rizhao
WwTW).
Compensation and income restoration measures are described in the RAP to ensure that PAPs
livelihood does not deteriorate as a result of the project. Temporary land acquisition is predominantly
in the road verges and therefore will not affect significant quantities of agricultural land. The affected
road and road verges will be restored after construction.  The period of disturbance for pipeline
construction is estimated to be about 2 months.
Impacts on people affected by relocation is also expected to be not significanit as these people will be
relocated to within the same village and they will have the option of either having their house rebuilt
for them, or receiving cash compensation and rebuilding houses themselves.  Compensation and
income restoration measures for people affected by house relocation are discussed in greater detail in
the RAP. The major findings of the RAP for each sub-component are summarised below.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                            Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
Feicheng
The construction of sewer network and the land acquisition for the WwTW impacts on the village of
Xi Fu Chun. The WwTW is located on agricultural land. A total of 73.5 Mu of land will be
permanently affected for the construction of the WwTW, affecting 94 persons. Temporary land use
will affect 20.7 Mu of land and this will affect 52 persons. The project will not result in any impacts
on community infrastructure, service and utilities. The project will affect 5 houses (17 PAP) which
are brick/wood structures in the rural area. Loss of crops will occur due to land acquisition for the
WwTW, (73.5 Mu). To avoid loss of crops to land users it is recommended that land be acquired
after harvests.
Heze
The land acquisition for the WwTW impacts on one village (Ma Zhuang). The WwTW is located on
agricultural land. The pumping stations will be located on urban lands. A total of 119.97 Mu of land
will be permanently affected for the installation of the pumping stations and WwTW, this will affect
129 persons. Temporary land use will affect 236.11 Mu, this will affect 12 persons. Affected
facilities and attachments include wire poles, telephone poles, trees and unsealed roads. The project
will result in the demolition of 14 houses (58 PAP) located in the rural and urban areas.
Rizhao
The construction of the sewer network, land acquisition for the WwTW, and pumping stations will
impact on 6 villages (Shan Hou Yi Chun, Donghai Yu Chun, Song Jia Yao, Liu Jia Chun, Song Ji
Yao, and Dong Xia Jia Chun). A total of 214.6 Mu of land will be permanently affected for the
installation of the WwTW and pumping stations, this will affect 435 people. Temporary land use will
affect 199.6 Mu of land, impacting on 255 persons. Affected facilities and attachments include wire
poles, telephone poles, trees and unsealed roads. Loss of land and crops_will occur due to land
acquisition for the WwTW and pumping stations, (214.6 Mu).
The WwTW is located on agricultural land that is used for growing wheat and a ponded area. In the
agricultural area there are three greenhouses that occupy 2,025 m2 and two simple houses (brick/wood
structures) in Shan Hou Yi village which are used for temporary agricultural production that occupy
90 m2 (PAP equals 6, 2 households). There are over 7000 fruit tree seedlings and 500 poplar
seedlings on the site. As the area has been reserved for the WwTW there are no other facilities or
residents located on the site. The acquisition of land for the Rizhao WwTW will impact on 418
people. To avoid loss of crops to land users it is recommended that land be acquired after harvest
season. The tlhree pumping stations will impact on 5.4 Mu (0.36 ha) of land in Songjiayao Village. In
total 17 people will be affected permanently by land acquisition for the pumping stations. Number I
pump station occupies 1.8 Mu of land. This is reserved as planning land and at present is being
ploughed. Number 2 pumping station is located at the crossing between Lanzhou Road and a railway
line, and occupies an area of 1.8 Mu. The interceptor network will impact oni 199.5 Mu of land
temporarily (255 PAP).
Ju County
The proposed route of the interceptor sewer network will predominantly traverse through bicycle
lanes, road verges and agricultural areas and along riverbanks. In total 26 Mu land will be affected

temporarily. The installation of the interceptor network will affect 78 people temporarily. These PAP
will be compensated according to the prescribed measures and standards. The proposed interceptor
will affected one house in Bei Guan Village (area of 50m2, brick/wood structure, 3 PAP, 1
household), and one household in Xi Da Jie Village (area of 70m2, brick/wood structure, 4 PAP, 1
household).
Cheng Wu Paper Mill
The WwTW proposed for the Chengwu Paper Mill will be an extension to the existing WwTW
located on site. No resettlement will result from this sub-project as all works will be undertaken
within the confines of the existing plant. The paper mill will not experience any significant downtime
as a result of the proposed works.
5.3.2    Demolition/Spoil
There is minimum demolition required for the project components and the issue has been covered in
the RAP for the project. As the treatment plant sites will be levelled before the project construction,
no problems of arable land loss, vegetation damage and notable soil erosion. SIEP has quantified an
estimate of excess spoil from each project component as shown in Table 5.7. SIEP have also review
the proposed disposal sites and found no special environmental problems or issues related to these
proposed sites.

SIEP also recommended the following mitigation measures relative to spoils:
1. Minimise the time of digging, burying, filling, and recovering.
2. The waste soil could be used for road construction. Besides, the transport and pile of soil
should be arranged after the discussion with land administration authority. Try to use farming
land as little as possible so as to mitigate the destruction to the bio-environment.
3. Transporting waste earth in the rush hour should be avoided. The construction units and
transportation departments should educate the drivers to obey the professional morals, drive

along the fixed lines, deal with waste earth and construction rubbish at the fixed place. They
should check how the plans are carried out now and then.
4. Pipe network project can be divided into several sections that can be started at the same time.
Project contracting units should provide temporary food and houses for workers at the
working area.
5. Building units and contracting units should connect with the local environmental departments
and clear the life waste on the construction area in time. If they meet the poisonous waste, the
project should be stopped temporarily and connect with local environmental departments.
Construction will be continued after they taking steps
5.3.3    Noise and Dust
Heavy load trucks for transporting pipes are mobile and intermittent sources emitting significant noise
during pipe laying, with noise levels in the range of 85-90 dB (A). The noise impact should not be
significant since they will only operate in the daytime, they are less frequent than vehicle flows on
existing roadways, and the WwTW sites are not in urban centres. The pipelines will often be
excavated using manual labour so dust and noise will be minimised.
Limiting construction to the daytime hours will mitigate noise problems. The pipelines will be
excavated using manual labour in many cases so dust and noise will be minimised. During the
construction operation of construction equipment and the running of vehicles will generate noise. The
toise levels will depend on the types and numbers of machines and vehicles. Generally their noise
levels range from 80 to 90 dB (A). The construction noise will have adverse impact on people living
near the construction site or along the highway. In order to meet the requirements specified by
Boundary Noise Limits for Construction Sites (GB12523-90), night-time construction activities will
be prohibited, with the use of trucks and equipment prohibited by 23:00 hr each day (except for road
crossings which may be allowed to minimise daytime construction impacts).
To lessen the influence of dust on the surrounding environment, it is suggested sprinkling some water
on the waste soil to prevent dust during the fine and windy weather. Contracting unit should act on the
plan, transport the waste soil in time, not to overload during transportation, not to drip on the road.
The wheels should be .cleared before the trucks go out of the construction area to prevent them
dripping earth and influencing the environment. Meanwhile, the constructors should carry out the
system to keep dean to protect the roads before construction area. Once there is waste soil and
construction materials, they should be cleared away at once.
If it is necessary to utilise groundwater pumps, they will be provided with appropriate noise and
vibration protection devices. This will be especially important for night-time dewatering. Mitigation
measures will be required as well as monitoring. Management practices are recommended to
minimise erosion and runoff from storage piles and for site clean up after construction is completed.
5.3.4    Transportation
There are minimal road crossings required and operational and scheduling plans have been developed
to minimise traffic impacts. Noise concernis normally would limit construction to the daytime but
road crossings will be allowed at night to minimise traffic disruption on major roads.

5.3.5    Safety Issues
The pipe trenches will be excavated by hand through existing sand and gravel strata that will require
wide, battered, trenches to protect against trench collapse.  Strict safety measures will be
recommended.
5.3.6    Public Facilities
SIEP indicates that no public facilities will be negatively impacted by HRWPCP components in the
project cities.
5.3.7    Domestic Wastewater
During the construction phase, a large number of construction workers will be working in the
construction sites. Except for some technical workers, many of them will be local residents, they will
have their existing places to eat and sleep. Therefore no new domestic wastewater discharge is
expected. Technical workers will probably stay at small inns in adjacent towns or townships, so no
new pollution sources will be created.
5.3.8   Industrial Wastewater During Construction
The Chengwu Paper Mill currently has inadequate wastewater treatment facilities that are causing
significant surface water pollution downstream  of the facility.   During  construction  and
commissioning of the new wastewater management facilities, the wastewater discharged could be
exacerbated due to removal of the existing facilities before the new WwTW are completed. Interim
measures to cut back production, provide wastewater holding facilities, etc are required to ensure that
this construction does not worsen the existing pollution levels. This will be particularly important in
the dry season, so the construction period should be coordinated to allow discharge of pollutants when
more dilution water is available.
5.3.9    Ocean and Beach Impacts, Ocean Outfall Construction
The construction of the ocean outfall at the Rizhao WwTW will undoubtedly cause some negative
impacts to the surrounding beaches and ocean resources. Coastal and marine biologists should be
consulted relative to necessary scheduling and other necessary mitigation measures to minimise these
disturbances. This is especially crucial for reproduction periods of the fauna.
5.3.10   Summary of Potential Gonstruction Phase Impacts
These potential construction phase impacts are relatively minor and easily mitigated. Details of
mitigation measures, and a programme for monitoring the effective implementation of the measures,
and the responsibility for the measures are summarised in Chapter 7.

5.4     Potential Operational Phase Impacts
5.4.1    Sewage Overflows (collection, pump stations, WwTW)
There are two categories of potential for raw sewage discharges. The first involves the concentrated
discharge of raw sewage at the WwTW location prior to the WwTW being put into operation, and the
second involves intermittent problems after the WwTW is commissioned. Relative to the WwTW
scheduling, Table 5.8 provides information on the scheduling of the WwTWs in relation to the
HRWPCP sewerage systems.

Table 5.8 indicates that the WwTWs will become operational at similar times to the new sewerage
systems. As such, there will not be a problem of concentrating the raw sewage discharges at a new
point downstream of the city. It is noted that the lack of background flows during the dry season, the
flat slopes and other factors reducing the assimilative capacity of the receiving streams, probably
would indicate that existing multiple sewage discharges within the cities would not significantly affect
downstreamn areas differently if intercepted and concentrated at the new outfall locations.
After WwTW commissioning, raw sewage may bypass the collection systems, pump stations, and
WwTWs during storm events (until sewerage systems have been completely separated), electrical
outages or when the WwTW  experiences operational problems. The wet well at the pump stations
and inlet to the WwTW will provide only a short-term buffer for such situations and raw sewage will
be soon bypassed under these circumstances.
However, it is not considered cost-effective to provide larger storage for these situations. The pump
stations will be equipped with dual power supply sources (i.e. from two different locations in the city
power network) as well as backup pumps for maintenance purposes.
Raw sewage currently discharges to surface waters untreated. It is noted that the receiving streams in
dry season will usually not meet the targeted Class IV surface water standards whether the WwTW
operates or not. As such, the large cost to mitigate this situation is not deemed appropriate during the
HRWPCP.
Durinig emergencies/power outages, raw sewage at Rizhao will pass thouglh an emergency 500 m long
short sea outfall. Although not a requirement under Chinese regulations and not contained in the
Chinese EA, the AC recommends that a warning device be installed to sound in tlle harbour when the
emergency outfall is utilised.

5.4.2   Industrial Waste Upsets
There are large industrial contribution to the HRWPCP sewerage systems and WwTWs, and pre-
treatment has been a problem in the project areas, as well as most of China. There is a possibility of
industrial waste upsets to the sewerage systems and WwTWs but rigorous influent monitoring will be
specified as well as operational plans to mitigate such problems. As noted in the following data, most
of the major industries discharge primarily organic wastes, which can overload the WwTW if not pre-
treated adequately, but are less harmful than industries discharging heavy metals or toxic substances
to the biological process.
In Chapter 4, Tables 4.9 to 4.15 provided details on the industrial waste contributions to the HRWPCP
WwTWs. As required by law, many of the larger industries have in the past constructed some form of
wastewater treatment. As the law required a high quality effluent, many of the industries are able to
discharge wastewater with an effluent that can hardly be improved in a municipal WwTW. It is
currently the intention that many of such effluents are discharged into the sewers. They will then
undergo a second treatment effort in the municipal plant. The proposed practice is based on the
assumption that industries do not give proper attention to their treatment works. This is confirmed
during many of the field visits: many of the works operate obviously only during the visit and energy
consuming equipment is switched off as soon as possible. Insufficient control will probably allow this
kind of practice to continue for many years.
'the authorities, together with the industries, should determine which of the industries should continue
or step up their treatment efforts, in order to reduce loads to the municipal WwTW. This process can
be guided also by means of an improved wastewater fee system for the industries, based on pollution
caused. Important is that industries that make an effort to treat their own wastewater, will have to pay
reduced wastewater fees. This will encourage the industries to search for pollution reduction, often
through in-plant measures, but also through end of pipe treatment.
SIEP evaluated the potential for industrial wastewater to discharge beyond standards to WwTWs with
poisonous substances, heavy metals and acid and alkali substances. This would cause water quality
levels beyond the allowable density of harmful substances in the biological structures regulated by the
"Design Regulations of Outdoor Discharge" (GBJ14-87). This could restrain the microbe activity and
even result in the death of microbe, lose the pollutant treatment capacity, and finally the accidental
discharge of the WwTWs.
In early 90s, the investigation on 5500 sets of industrial wastewater treatment facilities inland in
China demonstrated that less than one-third of the industrial-built WwTWs were performing
adequately. The major reasons are the small scale of the facilities, the high cost of operation and lack
of strict management. Certain enterprises directly discharge the industrial wastewater secretly for
some economic benefits.
The WwTWs must rigorously monitor the inlet industrial wastewater quality and record the
monitorinig results. The local EPB sectors should coordinate with the WwTWs to persuade the related
enterprises to pre-treat the wastewater, in order to meet the "Overall Wastewater Discharge
Standards" (GB8978-1996), the Class III in the pollutant discharge standards for the related industrial
enterprises and the "Discharge Water Quality into Urban Sewerage" (CJ18-86), otherwise, they
should not be allowed to discharge into the sewers and WwTW. As indicated in Table 4.15, this
requires a maximum COD of 500 mg/I, maximum BOD of 300 mg/I, and maximum SS of 400 mg/l.

Shandong Province
The staff should be trained and have suitable qualifications for monitoring duties. The relevant post
responsibilities and operation system  must be established. Monitoring management is the guarantee of
good operation. The WwTW must monitor the inlet and outlet water quality every day according to
the regulations and rules, and observe changes of the water quality and adjust the operation models
and parameters so as to discharge with standards. The HRWPCP includes technical assistance and
training to ensure that WwTW staff will be able to perform this monitoring role.
5.4.3       Noise
SIEP monitored the existing ambient noise levels at the proposed WwTW locations, as well as
proposed pump station locations. Noise monitoring was undertaken in daytime and at night for once
only. Table 5.9 provides the summary of this ambient monitoring.

Shandong Province
Among the 4 monitoring places outside Rizhao WwTW, noise at night to south and east of plant
boundary exceeds standard, as 0.8dB(A) and O.1DB (A). The main reason is that city traffic main
road is nearby and this traffic noise influenced readings.
Pump stations of Heze sewage treatment plant exceed standard at night because of the traffic noise.
Noise at the forward site, 1# pump station, 2# pump station and Damazhuang Village is lower than
standard both daytime and night.
Noise of Feicheng Sewage treatment plant exceeds standard only in the north plant border both
daytime and night, because of main line noise of the traffic. East plant border in south area and north
area of Chengwu paper mill exceeds standard at daytime and night because of Liaoshang Road and
traffic construction. Such condition doesn't happen at other places.
For the operation of the HRWPCP facilities, the noise sources are mainly three parts: (1) the sound
source from the polluted water pump station of city wastewater pipeline network engineerings in
Rizhao and Heze; (2) the sound source from city sewage treatment plant; (3) the sound source from
the subprojects of Chengwu county paper manufacturing factory.
The second class of standards in City Local Environment Noise standards(GB3096-93), which are
6OdB(A) in the daytime and 50dB(A) in the nighttime, was carried out. The second class of standards
in Industrial Noise standards(GB12348-90), which are 6OdB(A) in the daytime and 50dB(A) in the
*righttime, were also carried out. SIEP noise modeling was then conducted. Table 5.10 shows the
measured noise levels at some representative WwTW in China, according to the investigations done
by Beijing Environment Protecting Academy of the sewage factories in Gaobeidian, Fangzhuang and
Beixiaohe in 1999.

The noise 65dB(A) was taken to forecast at Im outside the pump room.  The influence on
environment of the pump station was determined by the distance between the influenced point and the
pump room. Normally, the new added value is 51 dB (A) at Sm from the pump station, 45 dB (A) at
lOrn and 39 dB (A) at 20m. When the doors or windows of the pump station are open, at each
distance the new added value is 66 dB (A), 60 dB (A) and 54 dB (A). So some requirements are
proposed as follows:
*      the distance between the pump room and the residential area or shop around it must
be more thani 30m.
*      the reverberation in the pump room should be less than 85dB(A).

*      double layers of protection should be taken between the doors or windows of the
pump room and outside.
*      doors or windows must not be open during operating and the measure of compelling
ventilation can be taken.
If all these recommended measures as above are used, the noise of the pump stations should not cause
violations of noise standards at nearby locations.
At the proposed WwTWs, the noise sources are mainly various dive pumps, pressure filters, rotating
brushes and sludge pumps, of which the noise intensity of a single machine is 75dB(A)-9OdB(A).
The noise forecast in the WwTW area is showed in Table 5.11.

The table shows that the noise of daytime and nighttime in the two factories does not exceed the
normal value, and satisfied with the requirements of the second class of standards in GB 12348-90.
The analogy investigation was taken in the environment evaluation of Feicheng WwTW. Because the
north boundary of the WwTW is close to the main road between Taian and Linyi, the measured values
exceed the normal ones. Because the distance between sludge dehydration room and the west
boundary of the factory is above 200m and inside 80m from the east and south boundary there are no
noise source, the values of the west, east and south boundaries can not exceed the normal values.
The measured values of Damazhuang village, which is 200m from the north boundary of Heze
sewage factory, and Xifu village, which is 200m from the northeast boundary of Feicheng sewage
factory, do not exceed the normal values. Because the distance is longer, the noise values of the two
villages will not excel the normal ones after the engineering is constructed.
A noise forecast of Chengwu counity paper manufacturing factory was also made.  From  the
ichnography of the factory, the project will influence the west boundary of the factory. The present
monitored values of the west boundary are 55.3dB(A) in daytime and 45.6dB(A) in the nighttime, and
the new added value is 48dB(A); the superposition values are 56.2dB(A) in daytime and 49.8dB(A) in
the nighttime. The superposition values do not exceed the normal ones.
Because the east boundary in the north and south region is closed to Liao-shang road, the present
measured values exceed the normal ones. After the project is constructed, except the two boundaries,
the other boundaries do riot exceed the normal values.

5.4.4    Odours
Offensive odours generated in the operational phase of the plant emit in the form of plane source.
Since offensive odours are emitted from ground sources, an inversion layer close to the ground can
affect diffusion in the air.
SIEP did some worse-case scenario modelling of the potential odour from the WwTWs based on
existing WwTW data. The model was the equation of hygiene protection distance of wastewater
plant. The calculation of hygiene protection distance adopts the equation recommended in The
Technical Method to Work Out Local Air Pollutant Discharging Standard. (GB/T13201-91).
To calculate each plant's hygiene protection distance according to related design parameter and
coefficient of GB/Tl3201-91, refer to Table 5.12.

treatment)

Feicheng WwTW                    101.2
From Table 5.12, the result of hygiene protection distance in this phase of project in Rizhao, Heze and
Feicheng WwTWs are 61.3m, 127.9m, 101.2m respectively. According to GB/T13201-91, when
hygiene protection distance is within 100m, the level difference is 50m. When distance is over 100m,
the level difference is 200m. So SIEP determined the hygiene protection distance of Rizhao, Heze and
Feicheng WwTWs are I00m, 200m and 200m respectively. Because three plants will extend in 2010
or so, the 100m distance in Rizhao can't satisfy the needs in 2010. SIEP believe the odour hygiene
protection distance in Rizhao should be adjusted to 200m (to consider the extend project in Heze and
Feicheng plants to be two times, 200m can still satisfy the need).
As such, the hygiene protection distance in Heze, Feicheng and Rizhao WwTWs were set by SIEP at
200m. There is no residential area and other sensitive targets in the scope of 200m outside the Heze
plant border. The nearest village to the WwTW is Mazhuang, which is to the northwest, the shortest
distance is 200m. SIEP recommends restricting Mazhuang to extend to southeast in future. There is no
residential area in the scope of 200m outside the Feicheng plant border. The nearest village is Xifu
village to the northeast the shortest distance is 200m. In future, Xifu residential area should be
restricted to extend to southwest.
In the area 50-150m to north border of Rizhao plant, there are five dormitory buildings of Electricity
Corporation. In 20-200m scope outside west plant border, there are part villagers of Donghaiyu
village. According to Rizhao city plan, in 45in western to the wastewater plant there is Donghaiyu
central Road, which width is 30m. The resident along two sides of the road will move to the living
area (at present, Shanhou village has built a living area). The moving is based on the policy to reform

old-city. City moving office is responsible for the moving cost. The project will not charge city
association fee.
The dormitories of Electricity Corporation are temporary buildings (the area is planned to be
industrial land), they are used for constructing Rizhao electricity plant. Now, the construction of
electricity plant is up to the end, parts of the stuff have moved back to head department of Weifang
Corporation. The city plant department has controlled these two residential areas to build new houses.
Part of resident in the scope of Rizhao WwTW hygiene protection distance should move out
according to city plan, not because of this project. Steps should be adopted to move all the residents
out of the hygiene protection distance scope before the wastewater constructed and put into use.
Other measures were suggested by SIEP to minimise potential odour problems as follows:
1. Strengthen virescence.
Because the WwTW produces odour inevitably, so virescence engineering is important to
improve the environmental quality of WwTW. The designs of plant area virescence and shop
drawing should be finished at the same time. Plant area virescence need to plant flowers,
grass and trees widely, for dying out the bare ground. Plant arbor, shrub, pine and cypress
beside the road in the plant area. Planting poplar, locust tree at the edge of plant area to form
-      protective belt, to decrease the impact of stench pollution.
2. Strengthen management to the odour source.
Odour is produced easily in the process of sludge treatment. The main method for decreasing
the odour is to strengthen management in the operating process in WwTW. Control anaerobic
fermentation in sludge concentration, clear and transport in time after sludge dewatering, and
reduce sludge stockpiling, etc. If adopting sludge compost method to treat sludge deeply, the
exhausting and deodorizing instruments are needed.
3. Reasonable layout.
The construction which produce odour easily should be set at the downwilnd side in layout of
WwTW. Producing area and living area should be separated by shelter belt to decrease the
impact on living area by stench.
4. Land use layout should be reasonable.
According to the determinate distance of hygiene defending, project department should design
the land in the scope. Definitely forbid building sensitive units such as residential area,
school, hospital, etc.
5. Safety management.
According to the relative national prescript, for the unapproved emission of harmful gases, the
industry enterprise should adopt reasonable technological process, strengthen production
managemenit and facility maintenance. After the project put into use, accident disposal

Shandong Province
training to the employee is needed. The monitoring instrument should be maintained
regularly. Pay attention to ventilate in pump station when person entered, avoid the harmful
impact by the deposit H2S.
5.4.5    Chengwu Air Quality Impact
STEP performed an analysis of ambient air quality potential impacts for SO2 and TSP from the
proposed Chengwu Paper Mill project. This evaluation chose representative places to evaluate
Chengwu county's environmental atmosphere quality impact.
The results of this air quality assessment indicated that the maximum  value/hour of SO2 is
0.035mg/M3, which is 7.0% of the standard. The rate of maximum value arising is 0.2%,
accumulation value 0.049mg/M3, occupying 9.8% of the standard, within the scope of the standard.
The maximum value/hour of SO2 is 0.006mg/M3, which is 4% of the standard. Accumulation value is
0.016mg/M3, occupying 11.3% of the standard. The maximum average concentration of TSP per day
is 0.001mg/MI3, occupying 0.3% of the standard. Accumulation value is 0.275mg/M3, occupying
9 1.7% of the standard, not exceeding the standard.
The average concentration/year of S02 is 0.002mg/M3; TSP, 0.00lmg/M3, not exceeding the standard.
-nvironmental atmosphere quality is fairly good in the evaluation area. The proposed Chengwu
project can keep the atmosphere pollutants discharging according to the standard, and doesn't affect
the atmosphere quality seriously. So the project is feasible.
5.4.6    Effluent Water Quality Impact
Treated effluent will constitute a pollution source and impact on the receiving streams locally and for
several km downstream. This condition is also aggravated by the fact that raw and treated wastewater
makes up much of the surface water flow during the dry season. The treated effluent from HRWPCP
WwTWs will cause an impact but the overall river condition will improve due to a reduction in total
organic loading.
Chapter 5.2.6 demonstrated that downstream water quality will be greatly improved by
implementation of the HRWPCP sewerage systems and WwTWs. Although there is insufficient data
to determine the exact conditions or mixing zone at the outfalls from the WwTWs, the impact of
treated effluent to receiving streams (with little baseflow in the dry season) is undoubtedly better than
before implementation of the HRWPCP.
5.4.7    Solid Waste and Sludge Treatment And Disposal
The solid waste produced in the operating period of the treatment plants come mainly from surplus
sludge, grit/sediments and screeninags debris, floating matter, sludge of septic tanks and dirt and
garbage regularly cleaned from the sewerage system.
The sludge of the WwTWs is made up of the combination of deposits and biological sludge (surplus
sludge). The volume averages about 0.5%-1% of the wastewater. The sludge will be high in water
content, large in volume, light in proportion, tiny in grain, and easy to decompose. The moisture

Shandong Province
content is 99.2%-99.8% before thickening and dewatering. The quantity of the surplus sludge
produced is involved with the water components, the pollutants content and the treatment technology.
Screen dregs and sediments belong to large grains and suspended substances. The quantity adds up to
15%-20% of the total solid waste of the treatment plants.
The quantity of solid waste from each HRWPCP project is as follows:
Rizhao: 75 t/d solid waste
Heze: 64 t/d solid waste
Feicheng: 24.8 t/d solid waste
Chengwu: 134 t/d solid waste (50t/d white sludge, 3.9t/d slag, and 7t/d dregs)
According to the FSR of each HRWPCP project, the disposing plan of solid waste will be as follows:
Rizhao- sludge cake, stabilised with lime, then sent to Dashawa tree farm (778.7 ha),
as fertilizer;
Heze- sludge to landfill at Liuzhai rubbish farm, which was opened in Oct.1999 and

Chengwu- bury the white sludge, polluted sludge and slag. There are three burying
landfills, namely Xi brick factory, Zhangshidian brick factory and Bei brick factory,
of which the total capacity is 200 thousand m3.
STEP has obtained and provided copies of letters of commitment from all the proposed wastewater
companies and the operators of the landfills and tree farms that states that the sludge can be disposed
of as planned above. According to SIEP no charges will be levied for disposal of sludge by these
routes.
The content of nutritive elements in sludge is the important basis which decides if the sludge can be
used on agriculture. From some relative materials, the data of the fertilizer efficiency of sludge from
wastewater factory are showed in Table 5.13.

From  Table 5.13, the contenit of organic matter in sludge accounts for over half of dry solid, and is 2
to 3 times more than common farm manure. Because sludge has abundant organic matter and plant
nutrients such as nitrogeni, phosplhorus and potassium, it has been the ideal compound fertilizer and

soil improver. So it is the best method to dispose sludge as farm fertilizer. However, the sludge may
also have heavy metal ions, germs and the eggs of parasites, which are harmful to plants and soil, as
well as the farmers and other persons living in the vicinity.
The content of heavy metal ions in sludge is related to rate of industrial wastewater among city
wastewater and industrial character. The 50% heavy metal ions in wastewater transfer to sludge after
the second treatment (heavy metal is deposit or absorbed by sludge after common sedimentation).

The digested sludge leaches the bacteria effectively and averts pollution. Oxidation ditch are used in
the HRWPCP WwTWs (except for Rizhao). There are no sludge digestion systems in these WwTWs,
the remaining sludge in oxidation ditch is dehydrated directly after thickening. The sludge with age
of 30d has the similar stability with digested sludge. The sludge in oxidation ditch has age of 15d and
the stability is weaker than digested sludge. So it must be sterilized before use in arable field. Also,
Rizhao sludge is from primary treatment only with no digestion. Therefore, Rizhao sludge will be
stabilised using lime before dewatering.
The HRWPCP proposed plans have the sludge fertilising trees in Rizhao and Feicheng, because its
heavy metal content is lower than the fertilising standard of grain plants. It is buried in ditch. This
plan is suitable, but the earth environment content and accumulation of heavy metal be paid attention.
The fertilising quality should be controlled and less thani 1000kg/Mu year (dry sludge).  The

environment protection department should check the earth heavy metal content and health standard to
utilise sludge reasonably.
The sludge in Heze buried in Liuzhai refuse dump, which opened in October of 1999. Heze City
Liuzhai sanitation treatment place lies in northwest of Heze urban area, the distance is approxi'mate
10Km, its occupation of land is 280mu. It uses sanitary landfill method, can treats 500 ton waste
every day, has the capability to take the sludge of Heze WwTW. In order to avoid secondary
pollution, the strict management and working routine are needed in the processing of filling the sludge
in this assessment.
Filling place of white mud, sludge from Chengwu sub-project are the earth-borrow pits of three brick
kilns, total area of three pits is about 200,000m2, average depth is 6m, total capacity, 1,200,000m3.
The silt seam and clay layers are in several bands up to 15m underground at the three brick fields.
The clay can obstruct element of white slimes, protecting the groundwater from contamination. To
prevent from permeating to the underground, the bottom of the storing place also adopt composite
geomembrane, half of barrier wall around the place adopts composite geomembrane to prevent
permeating. The filling of white mud and sludge is constructed separately according to 2mx2m cells.
Side slope of sludge storing place adopts ashler barrier wall. Concrete method. is, using sands as
lining, then paving with ashler, finally, jointing with cement. The depth of ashler is 30cm, and sands,
10cm. The filling of sludge, white mud in filling place should set first layer, middle layer and final
layer. Filling material may be clay or earth left form construction so as to prevent the direct contact of
white mud, sludge and the environment.
5.4.8    O&M Problems
Observation of centralised WwTW in other Chinese cities would indicate that operation and
maintenance (O&M) could be a problem. The design of the HRWPCP WwTWs has taken simplicity
of operation into account (oxidation ditches are simpler to maintain and operate than many other
systems) but mitigation monitoring will need to insure that the wastewater company does not try to
save operational costs by cutting back on power consumption for aeration, sludge digestion and
processing, etc. The operation of the WwTWs should have incentives based on WwTW performance
rather than minimising the cost of operations, so that management is keyed to ensuring proper
WwTW performance.
Likewise, the enforcement of wastewater discharge standards at the Chengwu Paper Mill will provide
the most direct tool to ensure proper operation of the new industrial WwTW.
In accordance with World Bank practice, detailed financial projections have been prepared for the
proposed wastewater companies being established under this project to operate the planned sewerage
and wastewater treatment facilities.  These projections take into account the need for the new
wastewater companies to be financially sustainable for the foreseeable future. Thus sources of
income, including tariffs charged to users, have been assessed to ensure that they will be sufficient to
cover operation and maintenance expenses and planned expansion of facilities in the future. The
tariffs have also been checked to ensure that they are affordable for the service population.

5.4.9    Organic Loading and Standards
There is a concern relative to the actual influent concentrations of organic pollutants at HRWPCP
WwTWs to either be much greater than or much less than the design parameters for the WwTWs.
The influent domestic sewage at the HRWPCP WwTWs will still be combined with stormwater that
causes lower concentrations of organic pollutants and the widespread use of septic tanks upstream of
sewers also contributes to these low loadings.
Relative to low-loading, the design values used for the HRWPCP WwTWs appear reasonable when
compared to the limited sewer sampling results, taking into account that the sewers have been
separated, and septic tanks will eventually be eliminated.
The concern over the potential for organic loading to be too high relative to design standards is
indicative of problems with pre-treatment of industrial wastewater in the sewerage catchments. If
such a problem occurs, the solution is for the EPB and the Wastewater Companies to apply and
enforce adequate industrial pre-treatment standards, not to apply unrealistic design standards on the
HRWPCP WwTWs.
5.4.10   Wastewater Effluent Re-Use, Secondary Impacts
According to the designed outlet water quality of the HRWPCP WwTWs, the indicators of the
tffluent water quality could meet the basic COD/BOD requirements of watering trees and irrigating
farmland, but does not accord with the water supply standard for industry and inhabitants. The
purified wastewater is not suitable for a drinking water source under current technologies and cost-
effectiveness.
The WwTW effluent could be used for industry, but it would require significant additional treatment
before use, requiring large investments by industrial users. It could be directly used for watering trees,
but a complete secondary water supply system must be built. In line with the present economical
conditions and the existing water sources, it is not economical to use the treated wastewater for
industry and watering trees. The treated wastewater could only be re-used for irrigating farmland, and
even then some precautions would be required due to bacteriological concerns since disinfection is
not used. The effluent will not meet the coliform bacteria standard for an agricultural water supply,
but much of the surface water used in China does not meet this standard.
The situation that Heze and Feicheng are lacking in water, creates good prospect for wastewater reuse.
This project needs large investment and high managing cost. But as the environmental protection
project, it has great environmental and social benefit. But to achieve good economic benefit, the
problem of wastewater should be carefully studied.
Reuse in the city or industry needs significant treatment to WwTW effluent. At present, the question
is not well solved in Chinla. The reason lies in project techlnology, but more import, lies in policy
management. Because the present price of clean water resources (including surface water,
groundwater) can't reflect the value enough, whiclh leads to waste of water resource, for example
more and more serious disconnect problem in the Yellow River recent years. The relatively cheap
wastewater resource can find market and produce benefit only the price is raised. The purpose of this
evaluation with the above opinions is to promote the project makes the environmental, social and
economic benefit efficiently, which needs efforts from project technology departments and

government managing departments. The meaning of the substitute scheme is that the government
managing department carries out related water resource policy is the prerequisite for wastewater reuse
work.
5.4.11   Ocean Outfall at Rizhao
Section 4.3.5 describes the environmental management issues related to discharges from sea outfalls
in the vicinity of Rizhao. Extensive modelling and assessment was carried out by the Qingdao
Oceanographic Institute for the Rizhao sub-component EA. The following general conclusions on
impacts were found from this assessment:
*      In the sea area near the existing six wastewater drainage outfalls, wastewater
particles' average maximum migrating distance is in the range of 4.14-4.16km. Tidal
current ellipse has a bigger ellipticity, the mixing process of wastewater and the
seawater around is adequate, so the wastewater can be diluted quickly.
*      The wastewater particles generally migrate to the mid-sea depth, and do not
obviously impact on the water quality of the port area.
*      The particles discharged during some tidal period times will approach the shore south
of Kuishanzui. A part of particles enter the port area, but the particles entering the
port area and approaching the shore are all diluted for five tidal periods, with lower
concentration, so they do not bring unfavourable impact to related area.
*      A 2.5 km ocean outfall was found to be a superior choice from optimization and cost
effectiveness analyses, compared to secondary treatment with short outfall.
In summary, Marine Water Quality Standards, Class III, can be met at the proposed outfall location,
except for 3 square kilometre mixing zone. However, SIEP analyses indicate that future phases of the
Rizhao WwTW should adopt secondary treatment rather than primary treatment in order to maintain
water quality standards outside of this mixing zone.
During emergency stoppages (eg power failures) raw wastewater will overflow from the proposed
WwTW though a 500 m long DN 1200 emergency outfall. The discharge point is at the low tide
mark and is in the vicinity of the port and fish farm ponds. Emergency discharges could cause severe
impacts to the immediate viciity for short periods. Although not a requirement under Chinese
regulations and not contained in the Chinese EA, the AC recommends that a warning device be
installed to sound in the harbour when the emergency outfall is utilised.
5.4.12   Summary of Potential Operational Phase Impacts
These potential operation phase impacts are relatively minor and easily mitigated.  Details of
mitigation measures, monitoring program and responsibilities are given in Chapter 7.
5.5     Potential Project Risks
The design of the scheme is such that any potential technical risks e.g. sewer blockage have been
mniniinised as far as practicable. However, careful monitoring of industrial wastewater discharges to

Shandong Province
sewer would be advisable to avoid the possibility of discharges that have a deleterious effect on the
operation of the new WwTW.
Potential financial and institutional risks associated with the HRWPCP schemes have been identified,
by the FSC, as:
*      Devaluation of the RMB
*      Improper project implementation arrangements
*      Delay in setting up of the wastewater companies
*      Slow implementation of the projects through lengthy procedures
*      Local financing shortfalls and delays
In addition, other potential risks could include:
*      Operation and management shortcomings within the new wastewater companies. It
should be noted that this is the first wastewater company to be formed in project
cities. During the initial years of operation management and staff will be on a steep
learning curve.
*      Less than expected revenues, for a variety of reasons, including slow or delayed
payments by industry and ineffective billing and collection.
The potential institutional and financial implications of the most likely risks to be faced were assessed
in the utility level institutional and financial analyses (see section 5.4.8 for further discussion of
actions taken).
5.5.1    Technical Risks
Flooding
Measures have been taken to protect the proposed WwTWs from inundation due to flooding of
adjacent rivers (construction of levees, bunds etc) and these are described in the FSRs.
Raw sewage overflows during storms
SIEP is consulting with the local EPB and making recommendations for appropriate warning devices
or signage to protect the public from raw sewage outfall locations during storms. It is not cost
effective to completely separate the sewer systems immediately, so some level of risk of exposure will
remain after the project.
Raw sewage overflows due to O&Mproblems
The pump stations are being equipped with dual power supply sources as well as backup pumps to
minimise overflows due to pumping problems. The TA and monitoring programs will help to train
operating staff to handle problems and minimise the down-time of the WwTW. The mitigation

Shandong Province
monitoring program will attempt to ensure that the facilities are operated as intended and no attempts
are made to save on operational costs by using less power at the WwTWs.
Improper sludge handling and disposal
The WwTW sludge is now being approved for disposal to landfill or to forest farms with prior
stabilisation. However, there may be attempts after completion of the WwTW to use the WwTW
sludge for farmland land application, with or without the appropriate checks on heavy metal content
or the use of lime stabilisation/composting as recommended by SIEP. The mitigation monitoring
program will attempt to ensure safe handling of the WwTW sludge, as the most serious potential
negative environmental impact of the operation of the WwTWs. In addition, periodic monitoring of
the landfills should be undertaken to ensure that the sludge is not causing any unsanitary conditions or
problems with the leachate control facilities.
WwTWAccidents
To prevent the poisonous gas like H2S, the measure lies in strengthening management. The managing
staff of the WwTWs should strengthen running management, keep the plant run regularly. So this
hazard is reduced as much as possible. The measures are:
(1) Construct benching/platforms in manholes so that workers can stand safely during access.
Educate the operating staff.
(2) Arrange trained people to check H,S on the spot, first -aid trucks wait at the access point
during maintenance.
(3) Wear gas-proof mask. Ring the alarm bell if the workers don't feel well.
(4) Important checks use GF2 launching Equipment.
(4) Check the gas in the sewers at regular time intervals. Study the protection technology and
wastewater system repairs.
Lack of Industrial Pre-treatment
When the industry wastewater contains poisonous matters, heavy metal acid and alkali discharges
over the standard, wastewater quality exceeds the allowable concentration. And it will restrain micro-
organism activity, even lead to WwTW failure. Concrete measures are:
(I) WwTW and related enterprises should sign a contract on pollutants discharging and
strengthen check and control managing, check the intake water quality at fixed time. Once the
problem is found out, the responsibility should be investigated and the problem should be
solved . According to the checking result, the running way or parameter can be adjusted to
guarantee discharginig reaching a set standard.
(2) Strengthen training. Working staff should go to work with certificate. WwTWs system of
personal responsibility and running system  should be carried out. Different people have
different responsibilities. In order to guarantee the various treatment units run regularly, strict
management is necessary.

6    ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED PROJECT
6.1     Introduction
In the preparation of Feasibility Studies and Preliminary Designs for Appraisal a number of options
have been considered before finalisation of the details of each component. Some of the alternatives
evaluated have environmental implications, for example the selection of a sludge disposal scheme.
Other alternatives cover alternative engineering solutions. Many of these latter evaluations have raised
no environmental issues but some do, for example the selection of the type of wastewater treatment
process to be adopted. In this Chapter the main alternatives investigated are summarised and where
significant environmental issues are raised they are discussed.
The projects in the HRWPCP are entirely wastewater projects, with four schemes including
wastewater collection facilities, three schemes involving secondary wastewater treatment using
oxidation ditches, one scheme using primary wastewater treatment and an ocean outfall, and one
scheme involving industrial waste treatment at a paper mill. The options associated with these sub-
components were generally similar with the exception of the Chengwu Paper Mill. As such, these
alternatives are reviewed in the next chapter by generic part of the projects, rather than by project city.
6.2     Alternatives Reviewed in Project Development
'6.2.1   Interception Ratio
In the interim until complete sewer separation can be accomplished, it is proposed to construct new
interceptor sewers under this project, and to collect the combined sewer flows for treatment. Storm
flows in excess of the capacity of the interceptor will be spilled to the river from overflow structures
on the interceptor sewers. In the future, when the sewerage system is separated, these interceptor
sewers will operate as wastewater only sewers, conveying all flows to the treatment works, and the
overflows will be decommissioned or retained as emergency overflows. The interceptor sewers
proposed under this project have been designed for either an interception ratio of I or the maximum
daily dry weather flow (DWF) estimated for the 2010 design horizon. However, at design capacity
the sewers vary from 50% to 75% full, in accordance with Chinese design standards, and hence there
is still some available capacity for increased flows. This design basis appears to be reasonable given
local funding constraints and Chinese design standards.
6.2.2    Pipe Materials
Due to concerns over corrosion of concrete pipes, the FSR Consultants in Heze recommended the use
of HDPE pipes for all pipe diameters.  A whole life costing exercise is shown in the FSR to
demonstrate that the use of the HDPE pipes rather than convenitionial local concrete pipes was cost
effective.
In Rizhao City, Ju County and Feicheng the risk of sewer corrosion is considered to be less and
conventional concrete sewer pipes are proposed.
Contract documents are being prepared for procurement of sewers. These will contain detailed
specifications for a range of materials, taking into account the issue of durability. The aim will be to

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                             Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
ensure that any pipe material selected on the basis of competitive tender will of sufficient quality to be
able to perform adequately for the design life of the sewer. The proposed approach appears to be
prudent.
6.2.3    Pipeline Construction
The Feicheng FSR states that sewers will generally be constructed using plain-ended concrete pipes
laid on concrete foundations. The joints will then be covered with steel mesh and cement mortar.
This is in accordance with normal practice in China for sewer construction.
This method requires careful specification and site supervision to ensure that sufficient concrete
haunching (90 degrees or more) is placed in order to provide adequate pipe and joint support and
minimise hoop-bending moments on the concrete pipes. Without such precautions there is a high risk
of joint failure in the future leading to infiltration/exfiltration and subsequently increased risk of sewer
collapse.
In Rizhao City and Ju County spigot and socket pipes will be used. However, the FSR still
recommends use of concrete bedding due to poor ground conditions reported in these areas.
The AC recommends that the proposed concrete sewer construction method be accepted but that strict
zequirements for hydraulic testing are included in the sewer specification. Furthermore, where HDPE
pipes are used in Heze it is important that sufficient, well-compacted, sand bedding is specified in the
contract documents and that site supervision is strict. Such an approach using the sewer specifications
should be adequate.
6.2.4    Number of Pump Stations and Pressure Mains
The approach used for selecting pump station capacity was described in the FSRs. The approach
takes into account the type of flows to be received (combined or separate) and the likely future
population increase of the area to be served.  The approach seems rational and should ensure
sufficient capacity to prevent frequent sewage spills from overflows on the interceptor sewer.
The exact capacity and number of pumps to be installed under this project, as well as the wet-well
arrangement, will be finalised during preliminary design. The AC has carried out a Present Value
(PV) Cost optimisation for the pump stations to determine if the proposed diameters for the pumping
mains are reasonable. The AC recommends that the pipe diameter selection be examined in more
detail during preliminary design. The findings of the AC check have been passed to the local design
institute.
The EA noted that there were no special environmental sensitive points nearby and the construction
and operation of pump stations will lhave no impact on1 the surroundings. Therefore, the designed
locations of all the pump stations are reasonable and feasible. Subject to the recommended additional
technical reviews and optimisation work, the proposed layouts appear appropriate.

6.2.5    Number of WwTWs
The collecting wastewater area and design of all the WwTWs in the cities accord with the urban
general plan and discharge plan, economises the project investment and minimises the technical
difficulty, meet the requirements of water pollution control and environmental protection, and has no
damage to the cultural relics and historic sites. Therefore, the collecting wastewater design of all the
cities is rational, at the angles of urban plan, technique and economy, environmental protection and
the protection of cultural relics and historic sites.
Various options for WwTW  configurations were assessed in the FSRs.  The options analysis
optimised the number, size and location of proposed WwTWs relative to the cost of the sewerage
system.
The FSR Consultant's cost analysis showed that the selected options for each sub-component project
were more cost effective. The selected WwTW capacities for the HRWPCP were deemed appropriate.
6.2.6    WwTW Site Selection
Shandong provincial government issued a document that addressed arrangements for drainage
prQgrams and compared several schemes so as to select the best one which would be included in the
Ihaster plan and to control land use. Each city then completed a drainage program before 1995. The
land use for WwTWs and pumping stations would be identified and be well controlled.
The design institutes and project units have also selected and reviewed the project sites carefully. The
locations of the project schemes have been compared and selected with the objective of reducing
resettlement, and minimising environmental problems. In order to further reduce resettlement all
administration buildings for water companies will be located at the site of the WwTWs or the
pumping stations.
In "The Regulations for Outdoor Drainage Design" (GBJ14-87), it is stipulated that the location
choices for proposed WwTWs must accord with the urban general plan and drainage project plan and
be defined according to the following factors:
*      in the downstream part of the town;
*      at the leeward of the town with the lowest wind frequency in summer;
*      good construction geological conditions;
*      minimal farmland removal and occupation with certain sanitation protection distance;
*      sufficient capacity for upgrading;
*      convenient for wastewater and sludge disposal;
*      complete drainage in the WwTW section;
*      easier transportation, water and power supply.

Shandong Province
In view of the HIRWPCP WwTW  cities' general plans and drainage project plan, the proposed
locations are the areas defined in the local plan as treatment works. Therefore, the locations chosen
accord with the requirement of urban general plan and drainage project plan and are reliable in line
with the urban plans.
In Feicheng, the proposed location, downstream of the city on the banks of the Kangwang/Kanghui
River, is selected for the following reasons:
*      Natural topography allows sewage to flow by gravity with no pumping required;
*      It is close to and downstream of the existing urban area;
*      It is further from the raw water source for the urban area than the other options;
*      The site is flat with few obstacles and provides room for future expansion;
*      It is close to the river for easier discharge of treated effluent;
*      No housing will need to be demolished on the site;
*      It has good transport links (next to the highway).
In Heze, the proposed location, at the eastern edge of the city on the south bank of the Zhu Shui River,
is selected for the following reasons:
v      Natural topography allows sewage to mostly flow by gravity with pumping needs
minimised;
*      It is close to and downstream of the existing urban area;
e      The site is close to a proposed new industrial area;
-      The site is flat with few obstacles and provides room for future expansion;
-      It is close to the river for easy discharge of treated effluent;
-      No housing will need to be demolished on the site;
*      The site is only I km from the main electricity substation for the south of Heze City.
In Rizhao, the proposed location, downstream of the city and near the coast, is selected for the
following reasons:
*      Natural topography allows most sewage flows to gravitate and pumping is minimised
compared to the other options;
*      It is far enough away from the urban area to avoid unpleasant odours;
*      The site is flat with few obstacles and provides room for future expansioni;
*      It is close to the sea for easier discharge of treated effluent;
*      No housing will need to be demolished on the site;
The site is only I km from the main power plant for Rizhao.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                          Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
In Ju County, no options for the location of sewerage are examined in the FSR. However, during the
site visit in March 2000 by the AC, the sewerage plan and FSR indicated that:
*   Natural topography allows sewage to flow by gravity with no pumping required;
*   Sewerage is has been sited in the existing urban area;
*   The WwTW is close to and downstream of the existing urban area;
*   The site is flat with few obstacles and provides room for future expansion;
In the geological analysis, the geological conditions meet the requirements of the project. The areas
are wide and good for further development. The plants are near to the urban roads, convenient for
transport, water and power supply. The proposed sites for the WwTWs appear to have been properly
selected.
6.2.7    Wastewater Flows and Capacity of the WwTWs
The forecast flows to the works were presented together with projections prepared by AC and used in
checking and sensitivity analysis. The capacities proposed for the WwTWs were evaluated and
considered to be sensible choices.  The "sensitivity" values were selected on the basis of the
experience of the AC in China and should provide a sensible basis against which projections can be
Zhecked. There was good agreement between the FSRs estimates and the "Sensitivity" projections.
6.2.8    The Quality of Wastewater to be Treated
The FSR Consultants have recognised the difficulty of obtaining representative samples of industrial
and domestic wastewater and the difficulty of interpreting the results of analysis where only grab
samples are collected or in some cases reported results are derived from factory returns. Under these
circumstances the FSR Consultants have selected a quality for the combined wastewater at the
WwTWs based upon local information, results from other cities in China and sensible judgement.
6.2.9    The Use of Septic Tanks
The use, or not, of septic tanks will have an impact upon the design of WwTWs and was carefully
considered in the AC's analysis. Septic tanks are simple and, if they are regularly emptied, they are
reliable and effective. However, there are two key reasons why they are no longer favoured by the
Chinese in general:
I. The handling and disposal of solids, without due care, creates a health risk and satisfactory
disposal is becoming more difficult as farmers are more reluctant to use the material.
2. The degree of treatment provided is insufficient to meet discharge needs where dilution
available in the watercourses is small. Under these circumstances the process can only be
considered as a pre-treatment upstream of a biological treatment process.
In China it is planned to phase out septic tanks, as separate foul sewerage and full treatment facilities
become available. Under the above circumstances the following policy was recommended for thlis
project, which seems rational:
6-5                                 August 2000



Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                           Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
Advantage should be taken of the present septic tanks as a pre-treatment stage for
biological treatment works until they are phased out.
New  WwTWs should be constructed so that they are capable of treating the
wastewater without such pre-treatment but advantage should be taken of the existing
tanks, while they are still in use, and the savings in operating costs which will arise
from their use.
*      Since the sizing of most of the biological treatment components is primarily related to
flow, rather than solids content or BOD, the capital cost penalty in constructing works
for the stronger sewage, will be small. There will be the advantage that the works will
be able to handle septic tank sludges if they are discharged to the sewer.
6.2.10   Treated Effluent Standards
The Chinese National Standard GB 8978 Class II covers the required performance of municipal
wastewater treatment works. The Chinese 'Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Waters'
(GHZB I - 1999 - which replaced GB 3838-88 at the beginning of 2000) is the current surface water
quality standard. It is the target to eventually reduce pollution so that Class III/IV can be achieved,
Class III for the Huai River mainstream and Class IV for main tributaries (except Shu River at Ju
County which is Class V).
Almost certainly the ammonia concentrations will exceed the Class III target and probably the Class
V levels. Bearing in mind that ammonia as well as BOD creates an oxygen demand on the river, the
AC fully supported the assertion of the FSR Consultants as to the importance of ammonia. The need
for ammonia removal is specifically identified in the Final Report of the Huai River Basin Water
Quality Management Report, prepared by Pacific Consultants Intemational and the Danish Hydraulics
Institute for the Ministry of Water Resources.
It was therefore recommended that the HRWPCP WwTWs be designed to remove ammonia as well as
BOD and SS. However, the case for removing phosphorous to meet the GB 8978 standard is
considered non-cost effective at this time, and the provincial EPB have agreed that the proposed
WwTWs should not be designed for phosphorus removal.
6.2.11   The Degree of Treatment
Where funding is short it is important to phase the works and to employ the most cost-effectiveness
degree of treatment, answering questions such as:
*      Is it more cost effective to construct a larger primary treatment works as opposed to a
small secondary treatment works?
Such an evaluation was conducted by the AC for the Sichuan Urban Environment Project, funded by
the World Bank, and the results are directly relevant to the Huai River Water Pollution Control
Project. This analysis showed, through the Benefit / Cost ratios, that secondary treatment has a clear
advantage in benefit/cost ratio over the option of using primary treatment alone whether the costs of
sewerage are included in the analysis or not. It also showed that secondary treatment was clearly more

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                            Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
cost effective in the removal of components creating an oxygen demand than the option of adding a
tertiary treatment stage, to follow secondary treatment.
Whilst costs might be somewhat different in the Huai Basin, the margin of superiority of the
secondary treatment with nitrification is so great that the conclusion will certainly be equally valid for
this project. From the "degree of treatment" analysis it was concluded that the process to be adopted
should secondary treatment (see Final Project Report of the AC, Appendix T2, for details of the
analysis).
6.2.12   Wastewater Treatment Options
Two main alternatives fall into this category:
1. Conventional activated sludge treatment with anaerobic digestion and dewatering of sludge.
2. Extended aeration using an oxidation ditch with aerobic digestion in the ditch and sludge
dewatering.
The preliminary treatment is common to both options and includes coarse screening, inlet pumping,
fm'ne screening and grit removal. In the conventional activated sludge process the sewage receives
primary settlement that reduces the organic load on the biological treatment stage but produces a
,ludge that must be further treated.
In contrast the oxidation ditch receives the "complete" sewage and primary settlement is not used.
The aeration tanks are much larger for the oxidation ditch since a long retention time is needed to
produce a stable sludge. The air requirements for the ditch are greater since solids, which would
otherwise be removed in primary settlement, must be degraded and the mixing needs are greater.
The ditch produces a stable sludge that can be directly thickened and dewatered, thus avoiding the
need for anaerobic digestion works. The unstable sludge produced in the activated sludge process
must first be digested before it can be used on agricultural land and indeed it is desirable to stabilise
the sludge if hazards are not to be created by disposal to landfill.
The capital cost of the oxidation ditch is less than that of the more complex activated sludge works.
However it can be seen that annual operating costs are higher for the oxidation ditch. A discounted
cash flow analysis showed the oxidation ditch to be cheaper overall than the activated sludge system.
The FSR Consultant has also compared the relative merits of the oxidation ditch and conventional
activated sludge works. They examined two forms of the oxidation ditch; (a) without primary
sedimentation and (b) with primary sedimentation. The incorporation of primary settlement tanks
upstream of an oxidation ditch would give rise to objectionable, unstable primary sludge. The FSR
assessments make no provision for subsequent stabilisation of this sludge. If they were to do so the
oxidation ditch with primary sedimentation would become even less attractive by comparison. The
conclusion by both AC and the FSR Consultants that the oxidation ditch should be selected for
WwTWs in Shandong Province without primary sedimentation appears to be appropriate (see Final
Project Report of the AC, Appendix T2, or FSRs for details of the analysis).

6.2.13   Sludge Disposal
Treatment works must be designed to produce sludge suitable for the method of disposal/reuse to be
adopted. In principle there are four options for sludge disposal:
*   Disposal to sea
*  Incineration
*  Reuse on farmland
*  Disposal to landfill
In the FSRs and local EAs, there were no firm plans for sludge disposal, it being stated that a decision
will be made at a later stage. The provincial EA recommends sludge disposal on forest land or
landfill, with sludge disinfection for primary sludge. The provincial EA also provided some criteria
for dedicated sludge landfills.
Incineration and sea disposal are both costly options and have not been considered further for this
project.
Use of sludge on agricultural or forest land is usually a sensible option since use can be made of the
organic matter and the nutrients present in the sludges. Care is required to ensure that concentrations
of toxic metals are not excessive but this will be important whatever disposal method is adopted. If
such problems arise they should be taken as a signal that industrial discharges needed to be controlled
more effectively. In general in China the industrial discharge of toxic metals is often controlled, but
ongoing monitoring will be very important for all WwTWs.
The cities have opted for disposal to landfill or forest farm land. In the case of Rizhao, which
produces unstable primary treatment sludge, the sludge needs to be stabilised with lime before
disposal. According to the research report of feasibility of each HRWPCP project, the disposing plan
of solid waste will be as follows:
-      Rizhao- dewatered sludge cake, stabilised with lime, to Dashawa tree farm, of 778.7
ha, as fertilizer
Heze- sludge to Liuzhai rubbish farm, which is opened in Oct.1999 and of 5OOt/d
scale, and bury them
Feicheng- sludge to Niushan tree farm, of 1,721.9 ha, as fertiliser
Chengwu- bury the white sludge and polluted sludge. There are three burying farms,
namely Xi kiln farm, Zhangshidian kiln farm and Bei kiln farm, of which the total
area is 200 thousand m3.
The proposed wastewater companiies for all project components as well as the Chengwu Paper Mill
have provided SIEP with letters of commitment from the sludge disposal locations (landfills and tree
farms) that they will accept the project sludge.
6.2.14   Chengwu Paper Mill Alternatives
Chengwu Paper Mill discharges to Nansi Lake Basin, at present, after the enterprise adopts spiral
pump-crushing machine for black liquid, it uses washer - two belt product line and a vacuum washer
product line to cleanse pulp material. Bleaching uses single part bleaching technology. Black liquid

and middle course water adopt acid separate method and physical chemical method separately. Paper
machine white water can be reused after being dealt with. When straw materials are steamed using
alkali method, some half cellulose and most lignin dissolve and come into blank liquid. When adding
acid to the liquid, lignin transforms and sediments out.
Using acid separate method to deal with black liquids the COD total removal rate is 60%-70%, BOD
total removal rate is 60%-70%. Suspended substance and tone removal is 90-95%, pH is near to
neutral. So removal rate of pollutants (esp. COD) is not high for black liquor. It will worsen the
polluted load of wastewater passed to the wastewater activated sludge treatment. And this method is
limited by these factors:
*  Small Scale of making thick liquid
*  Cheap waste acid
*  Lignin kind of product has a market or other management methods
*  Qualified Special equipment.
So, this method is not a complete managing technology. It can only be adopted as the transition
measure. The Chengwu Paper Mill has the liquid-making scale 23,000 ton/year. After the on-building
and forward project put into use, liquid-making scale cap reach 34,000tonlyear, If the black liquid is
still dealt with acid, obviously it is not reasonable. According to " liquid -making paper-making
industry environment protection industry policy, technology policy and pollution -preventing
Vieasure" made by China Light Industry head committee in 1997, wheat straw liquid -making should
obey the rule of making liquid and managing pollution collectively. The best technology for wheat
straw black liquid management is burning method to recover alkali. Therefore, Chengwu decided to
build alkali-recovering workshop to manage black liquid is in accordance with the technological
demands.
Middle course water treatment usually adopts physical chemical method, biochemical method and
physical chemical plus biochemical method etc. Physical chemical method mainly is to add coagulant
and flocculating agent to form flocculent flower in the middle course water then eliminate part
pollutant through sediment and air float. The rate of eliminating COD is generally 50% or so. Its
advantage is low in lump sum investment and short in process, but its rate of eliminating pollutant is
low, and using this method only will not be able to reach the standard. In addition, its operating cost is
high, sewage production is large, and it is difficult to eliminate water from sludge, if the sludge is
disposed incorrectly, second pollution may be formed.
Using biochemical method to treat middle course water is to eliminate organic matter through
absorbing and decomposition of micro-organism. It can eliminate organic matter completely, and the
operating of this method is stable and dependable, but its treatment effect will decrease when affected
by low temperature in winter. According to above-mentioned analysis, we can't only adopt physical-
chemical method to treat middle course water from Chengwu paper mill. Middle course water should
be treated by physical chemical method and biochemical method together when the project is planned
to construct.
Black liquid from pulp-making process of alkali method is usually treated by the following methods,
traditional burning method to recover alkali, burning-hydrolyzing method to recover alkali,
concentrating metliod, acid-separating method, SO2 method alkali separating method and physical
chemical method etc. SIEP has researched the examples of each method in 1996, after collected large

but the required instrument needs to be explored further. Acid separating alkali separating SO2
method concentrating method and physical-chemical method are low in investment, but the rate of
pollutant eliminating is high, more over, their profits is determined by the price of agents and
recovered product, and there is problem of sludge treatment and disposal in physical-chemical
method.
From the respect of technique, traditional burning method to recover alkali is an effective method to
treat pulp boiling waste liquid produced through alkali method, its technique is relatively stable, for
Chengwu paper mill, after the on-building project put in use, its pulp making ability will achieve
34,000 tons/year. So, Black liquid should be treated by traditional burning method to recover alkali.
As above mentioned, middle course water should adopt physical chemical method plus biochemical
treatment process. In biochemical process, oxidization tank, aeration oxidization tank, activated
sludge and biological contacting oxidizing and other method are usually used. The compare of
technical and economical effect is shown in Table 6.2.

oxidization
From Table 6.2, it can be seen that though the investments of oxidization tank and aeration tank are
low and the operating costs are not high, the basic condition is that there is abandoned field that can
be used. More over, its effect is affected greatly by the season (in winter, the effect is bad). The
staying time of biological contacting oxidizing method is a little shorter than that of activated sludge
method, but it increases the filled matter, its investment is usually higher that the latter, more over,
there is the life problem of the filled matter. From this analysis, associated with the concrete situation
of Chengwu paper mill, SIEP found it proper to adopt activated sludge method.
The technologies applied in the Chengwu Paper Mill have been found to be appropriate with the
following clarifications:
*      At present, many paper mills in Shandong have adopted similar technology, the
operating is dependable, eliminating effect is stable and reaches the drainage standard
prescribed by the country. That is to say, the techlnology has been proven in the local
area.
The discharged water quality can reach the national standard completely. Thus, the
technology process is dependable.

Major facilities in the process, such as no power are thin grid and concentrating
blowing machine etc, is correctly selected, with a stable function, and this ensures the
project to operate normally and stable.
*      In the process of biochemical treatment, N(8Omg/L) and P (18mg/L) are added to
guarantee the nutrition rate micro-organism needed, this guarantees the eliminating
effect of biochemical treatment.
*      Sludge produced in the process is concentrated and then dehydrated by machine.
Water content rate of dry sludge dish was reduced to lower than 80%, it is easy to be
disposed and second time pollution will not appear.
6.3     No Project Alternatives
The "No Project" alternatives merely continue the status quo of significant wastewater pollution in
four Shandong province communities and one industrial paper mill. The regular surface water quality
monitoring in the province provides significant evidence of the serious nature of river pollution in the
project area and the small urban corridors and streams ccnveying raw sewage may be an even greater
concern. Adequate wastewater facilities are a basic human right.
VWithout the project, environmental damage and economic losses will continue to-be incurred within
the cities and wastewater discharges direct to urban water bodies will increase. The situation will be
exacerbated as water use increases, as industrial and commercial activities grow and population
expands. Water quality, in the rivers flowing through the project cities would deteriorate further, as
would the situation downstream. The quality of urban life in the service area would probably
deteriorate at a time when expectations of higher standards of living are rising in parallel with
growing incomes and increasing environmental awareness.
Furthermore, without the sewerage element of this sub-component, the benefits to HRWPCP cities
constructing WwTWs with bilateral assistance will be considerably reduced in the medium term (until
dedicated sewers are constructed). For some time to come the new WwTWs will be treating
wastewater conveyed to it via the old combined system. Less of the wastewater produced in the cities
will reach the new WwTWs and that which does will be diluted with storm water and other infiltration
into the old combined systems. The effectiveness of the new WwTWs will therefore be significantly
reduced.

7    MITIGATION AND MONITORING MANAGEMENT PLANS
7.1     Mitigation and Monitoring of the Implementation of Mitigation
The project components of HRWPCP will potentially cause a variety of short-term construction and
longer-term operation impacts. A series of mitigation measures have been planned to reduce the
impacts to acceptable levels. The implementation of these mitigation measures will occur during
construction and operation. In order to ensure that the mitigation measures are effectively carried out
"mitigation monitoring" procedures have been established and the organisations to be responsible for
this monitoring have been designated.
The HRWPCP PMO will have an ongoing responsibility to track and report the monitoring of
mitigation measures of all the identified agencies, in addition to their direct responsibilities.
In this chapter the generic approach to the selection of appropriate mitigation methods and the
designation of typical monitoring measures and responsibilities is presented. The following coding
was used to identify the agencies responsible for monitoring of mitigation measures:
Agencies responsible for Monitoring of Mitigation
a.     Provincial Construction Commission (implemented by PMO.)
b.    Provincial EPB
c.     City Construction Commission/PIUs
d.     City EPB
e.     City Wastewater Company
f.     City Urban Drainage Corporation (or department)
7.1.1    Construction Phase - WwTW
There are four proposed city wastewater projects in the HRWPCP, all four of the projects involve
wastewater collection, three of the projects involve municipal WwTW. In addition, there is another
project involving an industrial wastewater facility There are obviously differences of scope and
impact but there are generic similarities in the types of impacts and mitigations that will be
undertaken.
Tables 7.1 to 7.6 provide summaries of the construction-phase impacts, proposed mitigation
measures, type of monitoring and responsible agencies.

7.3     Equipment and Training Requirements
The capital budgets prepared for all HRWPCP component projects include an allowance for necessary
laboratory construction and equipment at the WwTWs. An allowance for testing and environmental
monitoring costs to be incurred by the utility is also included in the operations budget for the project.
Environmental protection is considered a critical component of the HRWPCP project and a detailed
Technical Assistance (TA) program is under development. It includes training in management and
operations for the PMOs and the utility companies, in a wide variety of disciplines.
Accomplishing the specified monitoring and reporting outlined in this mitigation plan will be greatly
enhanced by this TA program. This TA program will also allow for improved overall performance
assessment of the HRWPCP program relative to meeting the project objectives. Future Phases of the
IHRWPCP will benefit from such assessments.
7.4     Impacts and Costs of Plan
The Shandong provincial PMO (SPMO) estimated long-term environmental monitoring costs
necessary to implement this plan. Long-term is defined annual monitoring required to verify the
environmental performance and other operational mitigation measures previously outlined.
Costs for mitigation measures that relate to the management of construction will be included in the
tender documents and costs included in the construction contractors' rates.
The SPMO have provided a table showing the World Bank project monitoring costs.

7.5     Long-term Monitoring of the Performance of HRWPCP
7.5.1     Lead Monitoring Offices
Nansihu Lake Basin Office and Yi-shu-he River Basin Office, both under the direct leadership of
Shandong Environmental Protection Bureau, are the permanent management bodies for protection and
treatment of the wastewater in Huaihe River Basin and Yi-shu-he River Basin. They take the tasks of
protecting the water resources and curbing water pollution in both Basins.
In order to implement the national laws and regulations on environmental protection, monitor the
operation of the project, learn about the effects of the measures of controlling water pollution in the
two valleys and work with the local environmental protection departments coordinately, the Basin
Office, which is in charge of the loan project, should conduct a unified management of the
environmental protection work and make regular check on the results of environmental monitoring
reported from the sub-projects and the work of environmental management.
7.5.2     Wastewater Schemes, Performance Indicators
The overall benefits of the HRWPCP will arise from improvements in river water quality. In addition
to the "monitoring" of means adopted to tnitigate against adverse environmental impacts, it is planned
to undertake monitorinig to define the success of the overall project. This monitoring will be
undertaken in the following way.

Shandong Province
River Water Quality
The overall objective in constructing and operating is to improve the quality of the receiving waters.
In all cases therefore the sampling and analysis of the receiving waters will be the prime means of
measuring the performance of the schemes. The following programmes of sampling and analysis will
be undertaken to quantify the benefits arising from the WwTWs. The programme will be conducted as
a normal part of the EPB duties.
7.6     Effectiveness of the Works
There are a number of key elements that can be used to indicate the satisfactory performance of
WwTWs. Records of the operation of the aeration system provide a good guide as to the effectiveness
of the biological treatment works whilst the operation of sludge dewatering works and the quantities
of sludge transferred to landfill provides an indicator for sludge treatment and disposal. The quality of
the treated effluent is however the ultimate indicator.
7.6.1    Other Operational Monitoring
SIEP recommends other regular component monitoring as follows:
To prevent the negative influences on environment made by the construction of the
sub-projects, local environmental department should send special person to monitor
the fumes, dust and the black degree of fumes periodically and noise randomly, and
finally make a record of these factors.
*      To ensure the normal operation of WwTWs to get the expected result of treatment,
the quality of water to the WwTWs must be monitored regularly. If the quality of the
water cannot reach the project's standard, there is need to report and make
corresponding measures.
1. Frequency of Monitoring: once a day
2. Items of Monitoring: ph, CODcr, BOD5, SS, NH3-N, TP, S2, oils, volatile
hydroxybenzene
As the basis of testing the efficiency of every link of WwTWs, the quality of water
from the works must be monitored regularly according to the discharge standard for
township second-grade WwTW stipulated in Integrated Standards for Wastewater
Discharge (GB8978-1996). The frequency and items are the same as the above-
mentioned.
*      For odour, set monitor site at plant border and sanitation protect distance border to
monitor H2S,NH3
*      For noise, set monitor at I meter away from the enclosing walls of WwTWs, monitor
A noise level in day and night every season.
*      An analysis on sludge component will be made annually. The items include the
fertility of the sludge and the content of heavy metals, (As, Cu, Pb, Hg, Zn, Cd)

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                          Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
Water area concerned in this environmental impact assessment should also be
included in the routine monitoring work besides the said project. In involved water
systems, there are sections controlled by province and districts are: Dongyu River
Zhangzhuang, Zhuzhaoxin River new city, Daqing River Wangtai bridge and Shu
River Dingjiacun in Huaihe valley. Related total quantity control sections are,
Dongyu River Xuzhazhai, Zhuzhaoxin River Yulou, and Shu River Xiazhuang.
Routine monitor is enough.
Each sub-project report regularly to Shandong Province PMO of the WwTW's
operating situation, include in/out water quality, treated quantity of water etc per
month, and odour and noise near works and pump station borders per year.
The local environmental monitoring stations report the results of the routine
monitoring of the rivers related to the loan project to the Basin Office of
Environmental Protection Bureau of Shandong Province monthly.
The local environmental monitoring stations of the sub-projects should be in charge
of monitoring the industrial wastewater discharged into wastewater treatment plants
*-           thoroughly, monitoring the wastewater from  enterprises with-serious pollution
regularly. The local environmental protection departments should supervise the
enterprises whose wastewater quality could not reach the standard, to make a
preliminary treatment of the wastewater, so as to enable the water quality to conform
to Integrated Standard for Wastewater Discharge (GB8978-1996) and the standards
stipulated in standards for water discharge from related business.
*      The local environmental monitoring stations of the WwTWs should monitor regularly
the quality of the water discharge from the works to promote its normal operation and
reach the expected goal. If the water quality does not reach the standard, the WwTWs
should analyze to find the reasons and readjust its operation or parameter to ensure
the water meet the standard. If the condition is ripe, an auto-monitor of water quality
can be placed at the sewer of the WwTWs.
7.6.2    Annual Environmental Quality Report
The recommended environmenital monitoring program is significant in both the construction and
initial operation phases of the project.  In addition, the specified monitoring involves many
participants from the project level to the national level. The results of this environmental monitoring
program should be summarized in an Annual Environmental Quality Report (AEQR), which is
distributed to all relevant project offices as well as the World Bank. The charts in the beginning of
the chapter provide convenient checklists for these reports, as well as the SIEP recommendations of
the previous section.
At the beginninig of January every year, each project construction unit sorts the relative monitoring
data and reports it to Shandonig Province Project Office, and Shandong Province Project Office
collects the data and reports it to the World Bank every year in the form of an AEQR. The minimum
informationi that should be reported in the AEQR is shown in Table 7.17.

Shandong Province
8       PUBLIC PROCESS AND EA PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
There are no laws in China covering requirements for public participation in Environmental Impact
Assessments. However guidelines were issued in 1993 in a paper issued jointly by:
The State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA)
*      The State Planning Commission
*      The Peoples Bank of China
The full title of the document is as follows:
"Strengthening the management of environmental impact assessments for
projects to be supported by loans from the international financing agencies"
This document includes a section covering public participation, which has been informally translated
as follows:
Public participation is an important part of environmental impacts assessment.
Particular sections should be included within the EA report covering the interests of the
public and social institutions including information on compensation. Public
participation can take place during the stages of reviewing an Assessment Outline and
reviewing the EA report. In accordance with present procedures in China, the following
methods can be used:
The Construction Unit and the Environmental Authority can listen to the opinions of
the County/District members, representatives of People's Committees, associations of
the public, students, residents and villagers.
Ask for opinions and suggestions from the public at or near the site of the project.
The above work can be done by issuing public opinion surveys, inviting discussions,
meetings or invitations to take part in the checking and reviewing meetings of
assessment outlines and reports.
The concerned authorities should take fully into consideration of the public views and
feedback to the construction unit, when checking Assessment Outlines and Reports.
8.1     Meetings with Public Officials in Developing Project and EA
During the 12-month project development time leading up to pre-appraisal and this EA, there have
been many meetings with the city PMOs, utility companies, city EPBs and other affected city
organisations to discuss the proposed projects and environmental assessments. These meetings have
occurred monthly at a minimum and have resulted in full collaboration with local officials and full
support of the project and the EA process.

Shandong Province
It is estimated that in total 30-40 meetings have been held with the public and over 50 meetings have
been held with local government officials during the development of the projects.
8.2       Survey of Public Officials and Citizens in Project Area
HRWPCP using World Bank loan includes four municipal sub-projects. Amongst these, there are
three wastewater treatment plants and wastewater pipe network project (pipe network project of Ju
county city wastewater treatment project ) and a point source industrial treatment project at Chengwu.
For the new projects, the public participate in the process to keep the project rational, scientific and
advanced. In order to get good social and environmental benefit after project is started, the public's
advice and questions are necessary. Investigation unit and construction unit launched the participation
activity together by doing random sampling questionnaires.
The public participation activity developed by assessment unit and construction unit adopted two
methods; random sampling questionnaire survey and holding meetings. The public participation
investigates public's advice and suggestion by using research papers. Public scope includes villages
near the plant, factories and enterprises. The public includes workers, peasants and students etc. of
different ages, professions, and cultural levels. Refer to Table 8.1.

The public put forward the following advice and suggestion:
1. It's hoped that the project should be constructed and run as early as possible to solve
water pollution and benefit local people.
2. It's hope that the construction should carry out "Three Simultaneity " rule strictly. The
construction should lessen pollutants discharging, control discharging standard, and affect
the surrounding environment to the lowest extent.
3. The construction should lessen pollutants discharging, control discharging standard, and
affect the surrounding environment to the lowest extent.

8.3         EA Disclosure
Publicity methods have included announcing existence of project and EA report on local radio and
television broadcasts, as well as being published in newspapers. These announcements give local
locations, generally the  local PMO  offices in each city, where EA  and  RAPs can be inspected  and
comments  made. They  also  give  contact telephone  numbers  where  information  can  be  obtained.
Posters summarising EA and RAPs are displayed in village centres and public meetings are held.
These public disclosure methods began in June 2000 wheni the HDI submitted the EA to SEPA for
review,  which   is  the   specified   time  period   in   Chinese  regulations.                       Since   the   project  is

environmentally positive, the late publication does not appear to be a problem, and there have been no
major objections raised to the project.
After finishing the environmental assessment statements of each sub-project, each sub-project has
held the second public participation. The construction unit of the each project city held meetings,
inviting villagers' representatives in surrounding area of the proposed project. After realising the main
content of environmental assessment statement, public widely expressed approval of the wastewater
treatment project. The proposed project will improve the water environmental quality of project area,
optimise the investment climate and accelerate the economic development.
In addition, according to the arrangement of the World Bank's experts, each project construction unit
will release project information by the media of newspaper, TV, etc. The public can consult relative
files of environmental assessment in appointed place arranged by sub-project construction unit, and
the public can express standpoint and view adequately. The media information release was held from
July 15, 2000 to July 31, 2000. Each sub-project construction unit will feedback the results of
information release to the World Bank in good time.
SIEP has confirmed that the sub-project EAs and the consolidated Provincial EA have been available
for public review at the PMO/PIU offices.
Tables showing details and dates for various consultation and disclosure activities for each city were
prepared by the Province, and they follow the chapter as Tables 8.3 and 8.4.
8.4     Summary of Public Input
The many meetings with public officials in the province coupled with the SIEP surveys of public
support show that these projects are extremely positive and well received by the public.  No
objections have been received by the city PIUs and there is no indication that there is anyone that is
not in support of these projects or would try to stop their completion.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                           Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
9    SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
9.1     General Conclusions
In order to control water pollution of the Huai River Basin and improve environment quality, the
HRWPCP was formulated in Shandong province by using World Bank loans. At present, part of
wastewater is discharged without treatment in the project cities, and the downstream water bodies are
seriously polluted. The development of agriculture and industry and life environment of people in
project area has been impacted greatly. At the same time, the pollution in local area becomes more
and more serious. Local officials consider it urgent to carry out the HRWPCP.
The HRWPCP projects have been properly formulated and they will form an important contribution
to the achievement of the goals of the WPCP. The construction of WwTWs in the Huai River Basin
has lagged behind the planned schedule of the WPCP, making it more important than ever to
accelerate WwTW construction. Significant progress has been made in regard to the control of
industrial pollution since the WPCP was formulated. However, domestic wastewater collection and
treatment remains far behind the anticipated construction milestones.
-With respect to the environmental protection, the general urban plan and the drainage project plan, the
design of collecting wastewater of proposed HRWPCP projects in the Shandong project cities has
proved to be reasonable, as well as and the location selection of wastewater pump stations and
WwTWs. The locations of the WwTWs meet the requirements of the local urban plans and the
environmental protection. The location choices of three pump stations in Rizhao city and I #, 2# and
3# pump stations in Heze city are rational and feasible. The choice of 4# pump station in Heze city is
also feasible after being move 40 m east away from former address which makes the distance between
the pump station and an oil station over 50m.
For the Chengwu Paper Mill, the project includes construction of alkali recovery workshop and
middle course water treatment field. After the project being carried out, pollutants such as wastewater
and boiler gas could attain standard requirement and waste residue could be used comprehensively.
Project alternatives have been comprehensively assessed, and the proposed project is technically
superior and cost-effective. The project will greatly reduce water pollution loading downstream of
Chengwu.
The designs of the WwTWs are reasonable. The technology of oxidization ditches for WwTWs is
economically reasonable and the operation is dependable, with CODcr, BOD5, SS, NH3-N, (except P)
capable of achieving "Overall Wastewater Discharge Standards" (GB8978-1996) Class II. The use of
primary treatment and ocean outfall at Rizhao has been comprehensively assessed, and the design
protects the ocean resources and meets water quality standards.  SIEP has recommended that
secondary wastewater treatment be used in any future phases of the Rizhao WwTW.
9.2     Existing Environmental Conditions, Huai River Basin - Shandong
The surface water of the Huai River Basin is mainly polluted by COD, BOD, organisms and
unionised ammonia. After the implementation of the 1996 Basin Plan, the water quality is improving.
However, the planned water quality objective of "Huai River Basin Water Pollution Protection and
Control Plan" and "Ninth-five years' Plan (1996-2000) has not been attained. No rivers in Shandong
Province are tributaries of the Huai River mainstream directly. The Huai River mainstream and the

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                             Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
Yi-Shu-Si catchments are hydrologically linked by the Grand Canal,. but most of the surface flow
from Shandong Province waterways flows directly to the ocean rather than to the Huai and Yangtze
Rivers.
According to water quality monitoring data of current situation of surface water in each subproject
area, SIEP indicates that the water quality of low reaches of Shu river and Dongyu river, Kangwang
river in Feicheng city and Zhushui river in Heze city do not attain standard requirement (category V
of Shu river and Zhushui river, Category IV of Kangwang river and Dongyu river). The water quality
of upper reaches of Dongyu river in Chengwu county attain category IV as COD and BOD and the
upper reaches of Shu river in Ju county attain category V.
According to routine water quality monitoring materials at control sections, in provincial and local
control from 1996 to 1998 and total quantity control section from 1998 to 1999, pH value in each
section attains the standard requirement. However, the values of CODcr, BOD5 and NH4-N do not
attain the standard requirement except for special year or period. (Category V for Shu river and IV for
Zhuzhaoxin river, Daqing river and Dongyu river).
For marine environment (at Rizhao), the water quality of current situation in ocean water quality
as-sessment (see Appendix 2) is as following:
pH: 8.12-8.17, normal value
DO: 6.31-7.13mg/L, near saturation state
COD: 1.87-3.37mg/L, low oxygen-consuming area
Inorganic N: 0.032-0.542mg/L, only C3 station exceeds the standard
As, total chromium, Cu, Zn, Hg, oil matter and inorganic phosphate are not detected.
In assessment marine area, each monitoring item attains category III of Marine Water Quality
Standard (GB3097-1997) except inorganic phosphate in C3 station. For base matter, according to
investigation result in 9 stations, each item attains the standard except that Zn exceeds the standard in
C3 station.
Monitoring data shows that ambient air quality is fine in assessment area in which average
concentration of SO2 and NO, per hour and per day does not exceeds standard and so does TSP except
that in 1# on account of road construction.
Some groundwater items exceed the standard in Heze and Feicheng project area, in which shows that
discharged wastewater has polluted groundwater to a certain degree. The groundwater quality in
Chengwu project area attains category IV standard.
Relative to noise, for 4 monitoring locations outside the boundary of Rizhao WwTW, the noise value
in south and west boundary exceeded standards with the exceeding value of 0.8 dB(A) and 0.1 dB(A)
respectively with the reason of traffic noise. The value of 3# and 49 pump station of Heze project
exceeded the standard during night with the reason of traffic noise. Others are lower than category 11
standard at day and night. The value of boundary noise of Feicheng WwTW attains standard except
northl boundary with the reason of traffic noise. The noise value in west boundary of Chengwu paper
mill exceeds standard at day and night with the reason of traffic noise and road construction.

Shandong Province
9.3     Positive Impacts
Public health projects like the HRWPCP carry many general benefits to the citizens of the project
cities. These benefits were outlined in detail in Chapter 5.1. 1.
The HRWPCP positive benefits listed below will be great assets to the cities affected and to Shandong
Province in general. In the following sections, potential construction phase and operational phase
impacts are identified. There are no significant environmental problems identified in either phase.
Compared with the positive benefits, these potential negative impacts are minor and easily mitigated.
Detailed mitigation and monitoring strategies should alleviate these concerns.
9.3.1    Raising the Output of Agricultural, Fish and Livestock Production
It is anticipated that following the commissioning of the new WwTWs, the water quality in the rivers
being used for irrigation, fishing and livestock production downstream of the inland project
components will improve.
It is anticipated that following the commissioning of the new sewers and WwTW in Rizhao, the water
quality in the rivers being used for irrigation, fishing and livestock production within the urban
boundaries of Rizhao will improve. Further improvements could be expected to fisheries immediately
off-shore of Rizhao in the Yellow Sea.
Productivity for all project components is therefore likely to increase through time as will the value of
the production output. However, the extent of further improvement in productivity is linked to related
pollution control programs for industrial and non-point sources.
9.3.2   Increased Domestic Output Due to Improved Water Resources
The principal benefits associated improved water resources with each sub-component were developed
and in Table 5.1. This table provided a definitive summary of the poor water quality conditions in the
HRWPCP project cities, and how the improved water quality resulting from HRWPCP interventions
could improve both surface and groundwater water supply sources in and downstream of the project
cities.
9.3.3    Public Health Improvements
It was estimated that around 20% of diseases in all HRWPCP project cities are water borne. The sub-
component projects are expected to contribute to a significant reduction in water borne health
problems. This will reduce the cost of medical care and increase output as fewer employees will fall
sick each year.
9.3.4   Increased Revenue From Tourism
The principal benefits associated increased tourism with each sub-component were shown in Table
5.2. This table outlined the existing tourist resources in each of the HRWPCP project cities and how
the proposed wastewater collection and treatment schemes could improve these resources.

Shandong Province
9.3.5    Increased Real Estate Values
Land values and rents are expected to increase due to improvements in the local environment as well
as the potential for increased economic activity arising from the possibility of utilising the local
surface water as a water resource.
9.3.6    Improved Surface Water Quality, HRWPCP Cities and Basin
The HRWPCP project cities will all benefit from improved surface water quality after implementation
of the HRWPCP and construction of sewerage, WwTWs and industrial wastewater facilities. For the
HRWPCP, the cities of Feicheng and Heze will benefit directly from the WwTW construction funded
by the HRWPCP, and the surface waters adjacent to Rizhao upstream of the ocean will also be
improved. The improved water quality treatment system at the Chengwu Paper Mill will have
positive impacts.
After the HRWPCP is implemented, situation of discharged and reduced volume of CODC, is shown
in Table 9.1.

From this table, the discharge volume of CODCr of each project after it is treated can all satisfy the
total volume control standard of the country. In addition, volume of SO2 and fume from oil-burning
boiler in Heze sewage treatment plant and boiler in Chengwu paper mill and alkali recovering boiler
all satisfy the total volume control standard set by local government.
According to the maximum permitted discharged volume to each total control section in Table 9.1,
the discharged COD volume before the project is implemented and the distance between sewage
discharge site and the section, the COD discharged will exceed the standard in the related rivers. And,
COD volume that enters into the river in 2000 will not satisfy the permitted volume either.
After the HRWPCP is implemented, the volume of COD that enters to project related rivers will
satisfy the requirement of the local WPCP goals in year 2000 (overall Shandong goals are still not
met). Compared to the required COD  discharge volume in year 2000, the reduced discharge is

maximum of 4.82 and minimum of 1.92 (SIEP ratios of project decreases to control standards). After
the project is implemented, decreased COD volume when operating in full load condition accounts for
46.9% of all reduced COD volume needed to satisfy total volume control target in year 2000 in
Huaihe Basin (not including Rizhao and Feicheng project). The construction of the project will have
great effect on the realising of total volume control target in Huaihe Basin administrated by
Shandong, but additional control of point and non-point pollution will be required.
The total COD discharged to the Shandong parts of the Huai River Basin in 1997 was reported to be
214,200 t/year. This figure was provided by Shandong EPB is reported to include urban, industrial
and non-point sources. From Table 9.1 it would appear that the project would reduce the 1997 total
COD discharges by approximately 17%. There are no figures for the total COD discharged to the
Huai Basin from Shandong in year 2000.
9.3.7    Additional Potential Benefits
Implementation of the HRWPCP components is likely to result in additional benefits, including:
Reduced risk of groundwater contamination in the service areas.
3      The impact of making realistic charges for wastewater services should help to
encourage waste minimisation at source, and internalise the costs of pollution control.
-      Amenity benefits to the population of project cities are likely to accrue as the quality
of the adjacent rivers improve. This could include use of the river for recreational
purposes and the development of riverside walks and parks for public use.
9.4      Potential Negative Impacts and Mitigations
9.4.1    Environmental Impacts, Construction Phase
During the construction period, the impact on the social environment, natural environment, ecological
environment and living quality is minor and occurs temporarily, periodically and partially. With the
mitigation during construction, the unfavourable effects can be minimised, and the time period is
short. It is unavoidable that the construction of wastewater collection and WwTWs will disturb the
traffic and daily life. Appropriate mitigation measures are proposed. The project will influence the
environmental noise and air quality of the surrounding, as well as the sidewalk trees, vegetation and
rainfall inlets. However, the range and degree are limited, and mitigation is proposed.
The project will affect four cities and one industrial area impacting on: (i) 890.48 Mu of land affecting
1055 PAP, of which 408.07 Mu of land permanently acquired (658 PAP), and 482.41 Mu of land
temporarily used (397 PAP), (ii) 1,272 m2 of housing (23 households including 88 PAP), and (iii)
facilities and attachmenits which include electricity poles, trees and sandy (unsealed) roads. No
permanent institutional or commercial buildings are affected in any city. A number of temporary
shops, total floor area 13,264 m2 are affected temporarily. Overall, taking into account all the project
affected villages, the average loss of land to each PAP following re-allocation of land in these villages
is not considered significant.
Section 5.3.1 summarised the major findinigs of the component RAPs. From the information contained
in the full RAP, it can be concluded that although the project will have permanent and temporary land
9-5                                  August 2000



Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                              Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
impacts these are not considered to be significant as these are small parcels of land in comparison to
total land areas in the village. For permanently affected land areas with the re-allocation of land in the
villages land holding per capita is not expected to be reduced significantly due to the small portion of
affected land.
Compensation and income restoration measures are in place to ensure that PAPs livelihood does not
deteriorate as a result of the project. Temporary land acquisition is predominantly in the road verges
and therefore will not affect agricultural land. The affected road verges will be sealed and the area
restored after construction. Period of disturbance for road verges is estimated to be about 2 months.
Impacts on people affected by relocation is also expected to be insignificant as these people will be
relocated to within the same village and they will have the option of either having their house rebuilt
for them, or receiving cash compensation and rebuilding houses themselves. Compensation and
income restoration measures for people affected by house relocation are discussed in greater detail in
the RAP.
The construction of wastewater collection should be combined with urban reformation and road
construction in every possible way. It will be well organised, properly arranged, closely monitored
and regularly managed. The earthwork must be piled between ditches and roads, and filled back in
time. All the top pipeline holes and ditches must have distinct traffic signs and warning lights at night.
The road sections within the range of 200m from the residential area should work only in the daytime.
High noise equipment is forbidden at night and the working vehicles must limit the speed passing by
living area. The exposed surface and the piled excavated soil should have watering and covering to
minimise dust. It is necessary for vehicles transporting excess spoil to use covered trucks. The cement
stations must fix enclosing structures. The construction unit should make efforts to protect sidewalk
trees and vegetation. If ruined, they must replanted.
The excess spoil will be carried away in short time and used in an approved manner. Disposal of
excess material must be in approved and proper places, without occupying farnland or only little
farmland, and actions taken to protect soil erosion and dust pollution.
The Chengwu Paper Mill currently has inadequate wastewater treatment facilities that are causing
significant surface water pollution  downstream  of the facility.   During  construction  and
commissioning of the new wastewater management facilities, the wastewater discharged could be
exacerbated due to removal of the existing facilities before the new WwTW are completed. Interim
measures to cut back production, provide wastewater holding facilities, etc are required to ensure that
this construction does not worsen the existing pollution levels. This will be especially important in
the dry season, so the construction activities should be coordinated to allow discharge of pollutants
when more dilution water is available.
The construction of the ocean outfall at the Rizhao WwTW will undoubtedly cause some negative
impacts to the surrounding beaclhes and ocean resources. Coastal and marine biologists shDuld be
consulted relative to necessary scheduling and other necessary mitigation measures to minimise these
disturbances. This is especially crucial for reproduction periods of the fauna.

Shandong Province
These potential construction phase impacts are relatively minor and easily mitigated. Details of
mitigation measures, and a programme for monitoring the effective implementation of the measures,
and the responsibility for the measures are summarised in Chapter 7.
9.4.2    Environmental Impacts, Operation Phase
There are two categories of potential for raw sewage discharges. The first involves the concentrated
discharge of raw sewage at the WwTW location prior to the WwTW being put into operation, and the
second involves intermittent problems after the WwTW is commissioned. Relative to the WwTW
scheduling, the WwTWs will be ready to treat sewage from new sewerage systems since they are all
coordinated under the HRWPCP in Shandong Province. After operations begin, raw sewage
overflows could occur because it is not considered cost-effective to provide either larger storage for
these situations or alternative power supplies.
The pump stations will be equipped with dual power supply sources as well as backup pumps for
maintenance purposes. Raw sewage currently discharges to surface waters untreated. It is noted that
the receiving streams in dry season will usually not meet the targeted Class III/IV surface water
standards whether the WwTW operates or not. As such, the large cost to mitigate this situation is not
deemed appropriate during the HRWPCP. For the Rizhao WwTW, although not a requirement under
Chinese regulations and not contained in the Chinese EA, the AC recommends that a warning device
te installed to sound in the harbour when the emergency outfall is utilised.
There are large industrial contribution to the HRWPCP sewerage systems and WwTWs, and pre-
treatment has been a problem in the project areas, as well as most of China. There is a possibility of
industrial waste upsets to the sewerage systems and WwTWs but rigorous influent monitoring will be
specified as well as operational plans to mitigate such problems. Most of the major industries
discharge primarily organic wastes, which can overload the WwTW if not pre-treated adequately, but
are less harmful than industries discharging heavy metals or toxic substances to the biological process.
The WwTWs must rigorously monitor the inlet industrial wastewater and record the monitoring
results. The local EPB sectors should coordinate with the WwTWs to persuade the related enterprises
to pre-treat the wastewater, meeting the "Overall Wastewater Discharge Standards" (GB8978-1996),
the Class III in the pollutant discharge standards for the related industrial enterprises and the
"Discharge Water Quality into Urban Sewerage" (CJ18-86), otherwise, they should not be allowed to
discharge into the WwTW.
Noise modelling conducted by SIEP indicates that the noise of daytime and night-time in Rizhao and
Heze WwTWs does not exceed the nornal value, and satisfied with the requirements of the second
class of standards in GB12348-90.  The analogy investigation was taken in the environment
evaluation of Feicheng WwTW. Because the north boundary of the WwTW is close to the main road
between Taian and Linyi, the ambient noise already exceeds standards. Because the distance between
sludge dehydration room and the west boundary of the factory is above 200m and inside 80m from the
east and south boundary there are no noise source, the values of the west, east and south boundaries
do not exceed the normal values.
The measured values of Damazhuang village, which is 200m from the north boundary of Heze
WwTW, and Xifu village, which is 200m from the northeast boundary of Feicheng WwTW, do not

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                           Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
exceed the standard values. Because the distance is longer, the noise values of the two villages will
not exceed the standards after the engineering is constructed.
A noise forecast of Chengwu county paper manufacturing factory was also made.  From the
ichnography of the factory, the project will influence the west boundary of the factory. The present
monitored values of the west boundary are 55.3dB(A) in daytime and 45.6dB(A) in the night-time,
and the new added value is 48dB(A); the superposition values are 56.2dB(A) in daytime and
49.8dB(A) in the niglht-time. The superposition values do not exceed the standards. Because the east
boundary in the north and south region is closed to Liao-shang road, the present measured values
exceed the standards. After the project is constructed, except the two boundaries, the other boundaries
do not exceed the standards.
Offensive odours generated in the operational phase of the WwTWs emit in the form of plane source.
Since offensive odours are emitted from ground sources, an inversion layer close to the ground can
affect diffusion in the air. SIEP did some worse-case scenario modelling of the potential odour from
the WwTWs based on existing WwTW data. The model was the equation of hygiene protection
distance of wastewater plant. The calculation of hygiene protection distance adopts the equation
recommended in The Technical Method to Work Out Local Air Pollutant Discharging Standard.
(QB/Tl3201-91).
SIEP calculated the hygiene protection distances in this phase of project in Rizhao, Haze and
'Feicheng WwTWs at 61.3m, 127.9m, 101.2m respectively. According to GB/T13201-91, when
hygiene protection distance is within 100m, the level difference is 50m. when distance is over IOOm,
the level difference is 200m. So SIEP detennined the hygiene protection distance of Rizhao, Heze and
Feicheng WwTWs at 100m, 200m and 200m respectively. Because three WwTWs will extend in
2010 or so, the 100m distance in Rizhao can't satisfy the needs in 2010. SIEP believe the odour
hygiene protection distance in Rizhao should be adjusted to 200m (to consider the extend project in
Heze and Feicheng plants to be two times, 200m can still satisfy the need).
As such, the hygiene protection distance in Heze, Feicheng and Rizhao WwTWs were set by SIEP at
200m. There is no residential area and other sensitive targets in the scope of 200m outside the Heze
plant border. The nearest village to the plant is Mazhuang, which is to the northwest of the plant, the
shortest distance is 200m. We should restrict Mazhuang to extend to southeast in future. There is no
residential area in the scope of 200m outside the Feicheng plant border. The nearest village is Xifu
village to the northeast the shortest distance is 200m. In future, Xifu residential area should be
restricted to extend to southwest.
Other measures were suggested by SIEP to minimise potential odour problems as follows:
1. Strengthen virescence.
2. Strengthen management to the odour source.
3. Reasonable facility layout.
4. Land use layout should be reasonable.
5. Safety management.
SIEP perforned ani analysis of ambient air quality potential impacts for SO2 and TSP from the
proposed Chengwu Paper Mill project. This evaluation chose representative places to evaluate
Chengwu county's environmental atmosphere quality impact. The average concentration/year of SO2
is 0.002mg/M3; TSP, 0.00 Img/M3, not exceeding the standard. Environmental atmosphere quality is
9-8                                  August 2000



Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                            Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
fairly good in the evaluation area. The proposed Chengwu project can keep the atmosphere pollutants
discharging according to the standard, and doesn't affect the atmosphere quality seriously. So the
project is feasible.
Treated effluent will constitute a pollution source and impact on the receiving streams locally and for
several km downstream. This condition is also aggravated by the fact that raw and treated wastewater
makes up much of the surface water flow during the dry season. The treated effluent from HRWPCP
WwTWs will cause an impact but the overall river condition will improve due to a reduction in total
organic loading.
Chapter 5.2.6 demonstrated that downstream water quality would be greatly improved by
implementation of the HRWPCP sewerage systems and WwTWs. Although there is insufficient data
to determine the exact conditions or mixing zone at the outfalls from the WwTWs, the impact of
treated effluent to receiving streams (with little baseflow in the dry season) is undoubtedly better than
before implementation of the HRWPCP.
The sludge of the WwTWs is made up of the combination of deposits and biological sludge (surplus
sludge). The volume averages about 0.5%-1% of the wastewater. The quantity of solid waste from
each HRWPCP project was estimated by SIEP as follows:
Rizhao: 75t/d solid waste
Heze: 64t/d solid waste
Feicheng: 24.8t/d solid waste
Chengwu: 134t/d solid waste, 50tId white sludge, 3.9t/d slag, 7t/d dregs
According to the research report of feasibility of each HRWPCP project, the disposing plan of solid
waste will be as follows:
*      Rizhao- sludge cake, stabilised with lime, to Dashawa tree farm  (778.7 ha), as
fertilizer
*      Heze- sludge to landfill at Liuzhai rubbish farm, which is opened in Oct. 1999 and of
5OOt/d scale, and bury them.
*      Feicheng- sludge to Niushan tree farm, of 1,721.9 ha, as fertiliser
*      Chengwu- bury the white sludge, polluted sludge and slag. There are three burying
farms, namely Xi kiln farm, Zhangshidian kiln farm and Bei kiln farm, of which the
total area is 200 thousand m3.
SIEP has obtained and provided copies of letters of commitment from all the proposed wastewater
companies and the operators of the landfills and tree farms that states that the sludge can be disposed
of as planned, and the charging system has been completed.
The HRWPCP proposed plans have the sludge fertilising trees in Rizhao and Feicheng, because its
heavy metal content is lower than the fertilising standard of grain plants. The sludge is fertilized on
the same of treatment. It's buried in ditch. This plan is suitable, but the eartlh environment content
and accumulation of heavy metal be paid attention. The fertilising quality should be controlled and

less than 1000kg/Mu year (dry sludge). The environment protection department should check the
earth heavy metal content and health standard to utilise sludge reasonably.
The sludge in Heze buried in Liuzhai refuse landfill that opened in October of 1999. Heze City
Liuzhai sanitation treatment place lies in northwest of Heze urban area, the distance is approximate
10Km, its occupation of land is 280mu. It uses sanitary landfill method, can treats 500 ton waste
every day, has the capability to fill the sludge of Heze WwTW. In order to avoid secondary pollution,
the strict management and working routine are needed in the processing of filling the sludge in this
assessment.
Filling place of white mud, sludge from Chengwu sub-project are the earth-getting pits of three brick
kilns, total area of three pits is about 200,000m2, average depth is 6m, total quantity, 1,200,000m3.
The silt seam and clay are interval in 15m underground at three brick fields. The clay can obstruct
element of white slimes, protecting the groundwater from contamination. To prevent from permeating
to the underground, the bottom of the storing place adopt composite geomembrane, half of revetment
around the place adopts composite geomembrane to prevent permeating. The filling of white mud and
sludge is constructed separately according to 2mx2m cells.
-Lbservation of centralised WwTW in other Chinese cities would indicate that operation and
maintenance (O&M) could be a problem. The design of the HRWPCP WwTWs has taken simplicity
of operation into account but mitigation monitoring will need to insure that the wastewater company
does not try to save operational costs by cutting back on power consumption for aeration, sludge
digestion and processing, etc. The operation of the WwTWs should have incentives based on WwTW
performance rather than minimising the cost of operations, so that management is keyed to ensuring
proper WwTW performance. Likewise, the enforcement of discharge standards at the Chengwu Paper
Mill will provide the most direct tool to ensure proper operation of the new industrial WwTW.
According to the designed outlet water quality of the HRWPCP WwTWs, the purified wastewater is
not suitable for water supply of drinkable water. In line with the present economical conditions and
the existing water sources of Shandong Province cities, it is not economical to use the purified
wastewater for industry and watering trees. The purified wastewater is only fit for irrigating farmland.
Ocean Outfall at Rizhao
These potential operation phase impacts are relatively minor and easily mitigated. Details of impacts
are given in Chapter 5. Details of mitigation measures, monitoring program and responsibilities are
given in Chapter 7.

From Table 9.3, it can be seen that the COD quantity to the river for near the proposed WwTWs can
be. greatly reduced by the HRWPCP projects.   The low water period of Zhushui River can reach
standard of class V and the flood period of Kangwang River can reach class IV.
nut each water period of the other rivers can't reach the requirement of class V, although it can satisfy
the water quality requirement of farmland irrigation. (water farming : COD<200 g/l, dry farming:
COD<300 g/l, vegetable COD<1 50mg/L).

period
From  Table 9.4, the control section's water quality of related river can be improved in different
degrees after each WwTW and Chengwu sub-project are finished . Especially after alkali recovery,
mid-piece water treatment plant of Chengwu paper mill has been put into operation, the mill's
wastewater effluent can reach the standards completely. It improves the water quality of Dongyu
River (Xuzhai brake section) extremely. In the second place, water quality of Shu River (Xiazhuang
section) and Zhuzhaoxin River (Yulou section) can be improved in different degree after finishing
WwTW matching to waste pipe network of Ju county and Heze WwTW. Because of the longer
distance (approximate 100km) between Feicheng WwTW and Wangtai bridge section of Daqing
River and less ratio of water quantity treated by works to flux of Daqing River, it is limited to
improve the water quality of Daqing River after finishing the project.
The discharge quantity of CODCr meets requirement of Total Quantity Control index made by local
government. Furthermore, the quantity of SO2 and smoke dust emitted by oil-burning boiler of Heze
wastewater treatment plant, boiler and alkali retrieval boiler of Chengwu paper mill also meets the
index. After the project being carried out, the actual reduced quantity of CODC, is 4.82 to 1.92 times
compared with the planned reduced quantity. Total reduced quantity of CODC,r in project area accounts
for 46.9% of total reduced quantity which meets Total Quantity Control target in 2000 in Huai river of
Shandong province. So the construction of project would play an active role in reaching the target of
Total Quantity Control in Huai river Basin of Shandong province. However, the HRWPCP project
cannot attain the total control indicators on its own in the short-term, and significant additional
investment is required for both point and non-point source pollution to allow the Shandong river
reaches to meet the water quality targets.

Shandong Province
9.6     Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan
A special environmental management unit will be set, responsible for the whole environmental
protection in the operating period of all the sub-projects, and regularly submitting the environmental
monitoring results and environmental management. Each WwTW needs to establish an environmental
management unit headed by a vice director or general engineer. (The environmental management of
the wastewater drainage projects will be guided under the environmental division set in the project
legal unit.) All the WwTWs should set an individual environmental protection section and fix
necessary staff, responsible for the environmental protection.
On the basis of the water quality analysis laboratory, each WwTW can set up an environmental
monitoring unit with 3-5 persons and relevant equipment, responsible for monitoring inlet and outlet
water quality, boundary and pump station noise, and main foul smell sources and boundary foul smell.
The local level environmental monitoring station is in charge of the atmosphere environment and the
water quality outside the WwTW.
During the construction period, the local environmental division is responsible for the environmental
management, and the local environmental monitoring station is in charge of the environmental
-monitoring.
The Environmental Monitoring Plan contains a definitive budget for the mitigation monitoring
program  in both the construction and initial operation phases of the project.  An Annual
Environmental Quality Report will be compiled each January that will summarise the results of the
mitigation and monitoring programs. This report will be distributed to the relevant local officials and
be sent to the World Bank for review.
9.7     SIEP Suggestions
SIEP made the following suggestions relative to implementing the HRWPCP projects in Shandong
Province:
1. Main plants of discharging pollutants in the service scope of WwTW should enhance
spot pollution source control. The concentration of wastewater discharge should
attain the standard of accepting water of WwTW.
2. The sludge treatment method of compost or making compound fertiliser should be
further demonstrated in order to improve the benefit of WwTW.
3. Other cities in Huai River Basin of Shandong province should build WwTWs as soon
as possible.
4. Tertiary wastewater treatment equipment should be constructed in order to improve
treatment effect when the economic conditions allow. Tertiary wastewater treatment
provides positive condition of reusing wastewater.
5. It is suggested that secondary biochemical treatnent technique should be adopted
whien the second phase of construction of Rizhao WwTW is being carried out.

6. Special design of treatment field should be made for the white mud and sludge being
treated in Chengwu subproject.
9.8     Conclusions and Recommendations
1.     The environmental conditions are serious and the environmental infrastructure needs of
Shandong Province are high, and expanding rapidly.
2.     The HRWPCP projects have emerged from a basin-wide prioritisation process, are well
formulated, and have detailed and complete preliminary designs and cost estimates.
3.     There is good public support for the projects based on meetings in the project cities and
public opinion surveys.
4.     The proposed projects can meet financial and economic tests of sustainability and are
affordable to the local citizens.
5.     Social impacts, consisting mainly of land acquisition and resettlement, are addressed by a
detailed RAP, and, in any case, are not significantly adverse,
6.     The potential environmental benefits of the Phase HRWPCP projects are large, as
reported in the previous sections. However, there are significant additional point and
non-point water quality controls necessary, along with hydrologic needs to maintain
minimum stream-flows, before the WPCP goals can be realised in the Province.
7.     Potential construction and operational phase impacts of the proposed HRWPCP projects
have been adequately assessed and no major issues have been identified.  Detailed
mitigation and monitoring procedures have been prepared which should adequately lessen
the overall effect of these potential impacts. Monitoring costs have been included for this
work and assignments detailed.
8.     The recommendations included herein by the Shandong Research and Design Institute are
rational and should be considered in the design and construction of these projects. These
recommendations included:
(a) Main plants of discharging pollutants in the service scope of WwTW should enhance
spot pollution source control. The concentration of wastewater discharge should
attain the standard of accepting water of WwTW.
(b) The sludge treatment method of compost or making compound fertilizer should be
further demonstrated in order to improve the benefit of WwTW.
(c) Other cities in Huai River Basin of Shandong province should build WwTWs as soon
as possible.
(d) Tertiary wastewater treatment equipment should be constructed in order to improve
treatment effect when the economic conditions allow. Tertiary wastewater treatment
provides positive condition of reusing wastewater.

(e) It is suggested that secondary biochemical treatment technique should be adopted
when the second phase of construction of Rizhao WwTW is being carried out.
(f) Special design of treatment field should be made for the white mud and sludge being
treated in Chengwu subproject.
9.     The overall conclusion is that the potential positive impacts are large, the potential
negative construction and operation impacts can be successfully mitigated, and the
projects contain no serious problems or "fatal flaws" in its formulation. The project
components are essentially environmentally positive and should be approved.

river after accepting the water from Yuni river, the value of CODC, and BOD5 exceeds standard value
with 2.78 and 0.77 times respectively, which indicates that the main reason polluting Shu river in Ju
county is the waste water from Yuni river.
The pH value in each monitoring section of Zhushui river does not exceed the standard value.
However, the value of CODcr and BOD5 exceeds the standard value seriously with the times of 28.08
and 39.15 caused by the waste water from Heze papermaking mill.
The pH value in each monitoring section of Kangwang river does not exceed the standard value. the
value of COD,r and BOD5 exceeds the standard value except Wuming section(5#). In the low reaches
of Kangwang river, the value of CODcr and BOD5 of the 7# section exceed the standard value with
times of 2.15 and 4.73 respectively.
The value of CODC, and BOD5 of upper reaches of Dongyu river(1#) meets category IV of Surface
Water Quality Standard except pH value exceeding the standard value. During the period of
monitoring, the value of COD,r and BODs exceeds the standard value with the times of 41.37 and
63.17 respectively after the waste water from Chengwu papaermaking mill entered. That is to say the
water body has been polluted seriously.

6.1.7 Forecast Results and Assessment
6.1.7.1 impact forecast to water quality of rivers for draining into
Forecast results to water quality (COD) of rivers for draining into (Zhushui, Kangwang, Dongyu
river), which impacted by the tail water, draining after treated by Heze, Feicheng sewage treatment
plants and Chengwu sub-project (alkali recovery, midpiece water treatment plant), is shown in Table
6.1.5.
From Table 6.1.5, we can see the advanced action to water quality of rivers draining for tail water after
finished each sub-project.

We can see the COD quantity to the river for draining into can be put down by leaps and bounds after
linishing each sub-project from Table 6.1.6. Low water period of Zhushui River can reach standard of
class V and the flood period of Kangwang River can reach class IV. But each water period of the other
rivers can' t reach the requirement of class W, although it can satisfy the water quality requirement of
fannland irrigation. (water farming : COD<200 g/l, dry farming: COD<300 g/l, vegetable
COD<150mg/L).
6.1.7.2 Water quality impact forecast to the control section of related river
Using the hydrological parameter offered by related river and COD cutting constant, we can forecast
the COD' s contributive density and cutting density at control section of related river before and after
finishing each sub-project. The results are shown in 6.1.7.
From Table 6.1.7 we can see, control section' s water quality of related river can be improved in
different degree after finishing each sewage treatment plant and Chengwu sub-project. Especially after
alkali recovery, midpiece water treatment plant of Chenwu paper mill putting into operation, the
mill' s wastewater draining can reach the standards completely. It improves the water quality of
Dongyu River (Xuzhai brake section) extremely. In the second place, water quality of Shu River
(Xiazlhuang section) and Zhuzhaoxin River (Yulou section) can be improved in different degree after
finishing sewage treatment plant matching to waste pipe network of Ju county and Heze sewage
treatment plant. Because longer distance (approximate 100km) between Feicheng sewage treatment
plant and Wangtai bridge section of Daqing River and less ratio of water quantity treated by plant to
flux of Daqing River, so it is limited to improve the water quality of Daqing River after finishing the
project.

For quality of culturing water of seashell which can be eat without cooking, the coliform  numbers
is lower than 700/L.
(3) Assessment method
Adopt silgle factor method
(4) Assessment result
The result is shown in table 5.2.3.
From  the table, we can see that assessment project in this sea area are all not over the standard, This
indicates that the water quality in the sea area is good. Pollution index scope of each projects are: PH
0.32-0.37, inorganic N 0.08-1.36 (There may be some mistake in C3 site value, so we don't discuss
it), COD 0.47-0.84, and dissolved oxygen 0.56-0.63. Other project scope are all 0 except that As in
C3 and petroleum in B2 are 0.16 and 0.30 separately. This indicates that the sea area environmental
volume is large.

C2 station has the max chlorophyll a of 2.180mg/m3. A2 has the lowest of 1.026mg/m3. Average
1.438mg/m3. Almost the same result as that of April, 1992.
The primary productive forces of various places are 47.45-100.83mg.c/m2.d. Average is
68.15 mg.c/m2.d.Primary productive force of C section is the highest, A and B are lower. The highest
molnitoring place is C2 station; the lowest is A2. That's because C section is near-the breeding area.
Compared to the investigation result of April, 1992, the elementary productive force-is loner this time,
which is related to low diaphaneity (average 1.03m). That is, turbid seawater affects the elementary
productive force. Compared to breeding water quality, the value is lower, belonging to oligotrophic

Sample of phytoplankton is chosen from type III phytoplankton net of shallow water, trailing net once
from bottom to surface. The collection, treatment and analysis of sample undergo according to
"Monitoring standard of Ocean". The results are:
(1)    Eormation of kinds.
31 kinds of phytoplankton including 25 kinds of diatiom and 6 kinds of dinoflayellates.
Dominant species is Haimao phytoplanktonGwhich locates in every station with big individual
quantity. The most kinds appear at B2, (24kinds), then A2(22) and C2 (18). The least kinds appear at
c3 (11 kinds) then A3 (16kinds). From the section location, phytoplankton of C section is the most, B
the least.
(2)    Individual quantity location
Changing scope of phytoplankton call quantity is 60.1X104-112.4x104Ind/m3, differing 1.9 times.
The average value is 81 .2x I 041nd/m3. See table 5.2.7 for Phytoplankton cell quantity location.
From the section location, C section has the most phytoplankton cells, A has the least. The quantity of
the area near the bark is lower than that of the area a little far from the bank, which is because the
former is likely to be polluted by man-made pollution.
Compared with the result of Apric, 1992, (46 kinds, the average cell quantity is 3399x104 Ind/m3),the
kinds and quantity become less this time.

5.3.3.3 Analysis of the Present Situation of Pelagian
The sampling site of pelagian is same as that of phytoplankton, low water type I net is used to drag the
net uprightly from bottom to surface of the sea. Sampling ,treatment and analysis are carried out
according to Sea Monitor Stansard.
(1) Biomass of Pelagian
The biomass scope of the pelagian is 17.2-62.9mg/i3. C3 has the highest biomass,-B3 the lowest. See
table 5.2.8. The average biomass of C section is 57.2 mg/in3, higher A section (45.2 mg/m3) and B
..edtion (33.3 mg/mi3). Nearshore is lower than farshore. High pelagian biomass location area accords
with phytoplankton cell .quantity high location area. The latter provides enough bait for the former.
(3)    Formation kinds and quantity change of pelagian.
This investigation chooses 23 kinds of pelagian, including protozoon, coelenterate, chaetognath,
ciustacea, tunicate and various kinds of larva, among them, chaetognath occupies the most. Strong
Sagitta is the dominant kinds of the investigation, occupying 64% of pelagian; next comes Turritopsis
nutricula, ocuupying 14.6% of pelagian. And Tontanns forcipatus aso ouupies a certain proportion.
In this area, the average amount of pelagian is 75.5 /m3 with 107.2/m3 of C3 station, the most. Next
comes C2 of 102.6/m3 and A2 of 89.5/m3. The least is B3 with 28.9/m3. The location trend of
pelagian quantity is similar to trend of biomass. C section average 96.7/m3 is obviously higher than A
section (74.0/m3) and B section (55.8/m3). See table 5.2.8.

Except that coliform quantity of C3 station exceeds the standard, other measuring places accord with
our country's seawater quality standard water quality not exceeding 70/lOOml at uncooked shellfish.
Breeding area, the ordinary sea area, it should not exceed 1000/lOOml).The coliforn quantity of C3
station reaches 1600/lOOml, exceeding the standard seriously, which says this area is polluted
seriously by life sewage. The lowest seawater total heterotrophicy bacteria is lower than
21.35x103/ml, lower than that of April, 1992(average 220x103/ml). From the different sections, C
section includes the most, A the least. Section location accords with colifrom.

6.2.1   Forecast of Sea Area Tidal Flow Field Assessment Area
6.2.1.1 Tidal Flow Numerical Model of Sea Area
(l)The fluid dynamic equation
For coastwise shallow sea, especially semi-enclosed gulf, its basal movement is tidal movement
caused by external tidal wave, that is to say synergic- vibration tide. So we mainfly investigate the
change of tide before and after the project.
Frame of reference describing tide-wave movement is placed so-called "f-plane", that is to say the
impact of earth's curvature is not considered. This approximate description is fit for the sea area which
level scope is far less than earth's radius undoubtedly.
Selecting a rectangular coordinate system fixing at "f-plane", coinciding with silent sea surface,
forming right hand coordinate system, upward direction of Z axis is positive, then the average
movement equation group describing positive pressure depth of sea is:

(1 )Tidal current model of large sea area
6) Calculating area and gridding setting
Selecting a larger sea area including the assessment sea area names large sea area. Above all, forming
the tidal current model of large sea area and using the calculation data can offer the border forced
water level input data to assess the sea area. According to the actual situation, the large sea area
selected for assessing this time is the area enclosed by connecting line of Dazhushanzui with east, west
Lian island and northwest land shoreline. (shown in Fig 6.2.1).
To the large sea area tidal current numerical model, we can use anomalous triangle's multiple step-
hybridization method to solve. Triangular grid by setting have 628 node points, 1075 cells (see
Fig.6.2.1). The minimum grid step length is 685m.
(D Depth of water and borderline of bank
Depth of water and borderline of bank of the large sea area can be confirmed through ocean chart
No.12510 and No.12570. Depth of water of assessing sea area can be confirmed reference to ocean
chartNo. 12571.
 Hydrosphere water level input mode
For normal semidiurnal tide sea area, M2 component tide substitutes the average situation of tide
usually. M2+S2 and M2-S2, by way of forcing water level of water border, substitute the average
situations of spring tide and neap tide respectively. For large sea area, the character of tide is normal
.emidiumal tide, so we can use M2 component tide as forcing water level. The calculating area's
harmonic constant of north and south terminal point can be got from harmonic analyzing the tide data
in a month. Other water border spots' harmonic constant can be got on the basis of interpolation of the
sea area's tidal wave system distribution. The water border forcing water level of the large sea area in
this topic input following harmonic equations:
A6~t) = HM, cos(aM2t - gM2 )             (6.7)
Mean tide substitutes average condition.
j(t) = (HM2 - Hs2)cos(oUt - gM2)          (6.8)
Neap tide substitutes most unfavorable environmental condition.
In the equation:
----- height of water level from static water surface;
t------- time coordinate
-------- circular frequency of M2 component tide
-------- harmonic constant amplitude of M2 component tide
-------- harmonic constant phase of M2 component tide.
(3 Verification of tidal current's calculating result
A: Verification of tide level
In Fig 6.2.3, real line is the actual measured value of mean tide from Rizhao ocean station, broken line
is the calculated value. The maximum error of amplitude is 2.0cm, maximum error of phase is 4mni.
This indicates that the calculated value accord to the actual measured value well.
B: Verification of tidal current
Fig 6.2.4 is the tidal current verification rose diagram from four measuring current spot of mean tide.
The positions of four spots are shown in Fig6.2.1. We can see the main current direction of four spot,
direction of rotation and the moment when maximum current happened accord the actual measured

value to a great extent from the Fig. Only the maximum current speed value has a little difference due
to the actual measured value is the value of surface layer speed and calculated value is the average of
gridding depths mainly. So the calculated value is less than actual measured value in a general way.
The differences of the maximum current speed by real measuring and calculating at spots of C1, C2, C3
and C4 are 8.Ocm/s, 11.0cm/s, 6.0cm/s and 9.1cm/s respectively. The differences of main current's
phase are 90, 28, 7and 160. This indicates that the calculated tidal current accord to the actual
measured tidal current well.
C: Tide wave system
The co-tidal time line and isoamplitude (Fig 6.2.5) of mean tide (M2 component tide) indicate that tide
wave, transmitting from northeast to southwest, belongs to anticlockwise tide wave system. The
cotidal time line difference of Rizhao port and east, west Lian island is 200 about, that is 40min.
The average tide amplitude near Rizhao port is more than 140cm. In company with the tide wave
transmits to southwest, the increase of amplitude is slow. In the large sea area, the amplitude
difference of the terminal point of north and south is short of 40cm. Above conclusions are according
to the historical data of census of the sea in 1958(Fig 6.2.6).
It is shown the simulation large sea area tidal current is according to the actual measured result well
through verification analysis from (A) to (C) above, so the calculated results can be acted as the input
data of assessing sea area water border.
(l) Assessing Sea Area Tidal Current Numerical Model
(D Gridding Setting of Calculating Area
The sea area, enclosed by connecting line L1L2--L2L3--L3L4 and the land shoreline is the sea area for
assessing as shown in Fig6.2.1. Their coordinates are LI(119'33'40"E, 3525'00" N), L2(119039'50"
E, 35o20'08" N), L3(119029'14"E, 3510'18"N) and L4(119'24'00"E, 3514'19"N) respectively. Fig
6.2.7 is the calculating gridding chart of the sea area for assessing, have 21105 grid points in all.
0 Depth of Water and Bank Borderline
Depth of water of the area for assessing can be confirmed through ocean chart No.12571 and
No.12570 as shown in Fig 6.2.8.
(D Verification of Tidal Level and Tidal Current
We select the tidal level data of Rizhao oceanstation to verify the tidal level of the sea area for
assessing. Selecting points C3 and C4 still is shown in Fig 6.2.1. Fig 6.2.9 is the tidal current
verification curve. We can see that the phase of actual measured and calculating tidal level is accorded
well, maximum differences of amplitude and phase are 1.6cm, 4min respectively.
Fig 6.2.4 is the tidal current rose diagram of two measuring current spots C3 and C4. Above the Fig is
the actual measured value and lower is the calculating value. We can see the main current direction,
direction of rotation and the moment when maximum current happened are in accord basically by
comparing two values. The differences of the maximum current speed by real measuring and
calculating at spots of C3 and C4 are 9.5cm/s, 7.0cm/s and the differences of main current's phase are
10.80 and 1,20 respectively. This indicates that the calculated tidal current accord to the actual
measured tidal current well.

From tidal current chart of two moments of mean tide, which accepted from numerical simulation, we
can see the flow condition of assessing sea area is simple relatively. The direction of flood tide is
southwest deflected to south and ebb tide is northeast deflected to north. Fig 6.2.11 and Fig 6.2.12 are
current fields of medial time of flood tide and ebb tide respectively, taking Rizhao ocean station as
reference port. The calculated maximum current speeds of flood tide and ebb tide are 42.1cm/s and
41. lcm/s, locating east side of Kuishanzui still.

6.2.2.2 COD Density Increment Forecast of Waste Draining Outlet Planning to Select
The waste water of Rizhao sewage treatment plant will be adopted deep sea draining method. Due to
new-setting waste draining outlet, we can't establish the response relation between COD input of
pollutant source and COD monitor data of water quality, so the COD density increment model is be
established only.
(1) COD Volume into Sea
The wastewater and seawater COD are determined by chromic and manganic method respectively. So
the transform relation between CODC, and CODmn is existed. Shanghai Planning Design Institute adopt
one-third method, that is CODcr=CODmn. From the data supplied by Rizhao Construct Committee, the
forward wastewater draining volume is 200000t/d, first level treatment density is 280mg/L. So the
COD volumne into sea is shown in Table 6.2.1.

Using first level treatment technique, the COD densities of six waste draining outlets planning to
select on condition of mean tide field are shown in from Fig6.2.15 to Fig 6.2.20.
The distribution of isopleth indicates that impacting scope in high-density area is very small, only the
water area near the waste draining outlet. Table 6.2.3 gives the center density increments of six waste
draining outlets planning to select. Maximum and minimum density increments are 5.39mg/L and
3.39mg/L respectively.

6.2.3 Lagrange Residual Current Model of Sea Area for Assessing
6.2.3.1 Lagrange Residual Current
In tidal gulf or water area near the bank, circumfluence develops from the tidal current, wind current,
streamflow and the interaction of them. The part of aperiodicity in which, that is seawater's net
movement after a definite tidal period, is called residual circumfluence (residual current). Though their
dimensions are less than tidal current speeds, but in ecosystem and ocean pollution problem, but the
long period transport phenomena, which act as the key, is determined by the mixture of residual
current and seawater mainly.
Seawater micelle is no longer to go back the initial position after passing through a tidal period, but
has a net displacement, specify by Ax, that is:
= y(x o+T)-jr(xPEo)                        (6.13)
UL = Ax/T                     (6.13)
In the equation: xo is the initial position of particle, t, is the initial moment, y(xAYo) is the
A2-13                                 July 2000

track equation, T is the tidal period respectively.
Due to studying particle's average migrate depending on Lagrange's meaning, so Ax is called
Lagrange drift, divided by period, that is the definition of Lagrange residual current speed:
UL = AxIT                    (6.14)
Lagrange drift and Lagrange residual current speed of seawater particles have reflected average real
migrating direction and speed of seawater period. So, they can reflect the transport direction and speed
of the dissolved state and granulometric state pollutants moving along with seawater. Because it is full
of seawater particles in the current field everywhere, we can establish the conception of residual
current field. By way of analyzing the distribution of sea area Lagrange residual current field, we can
differentiate the active area of water exchange, which Lagrange residual current speed is higher, and
the creeping area which the speed is lower. It can offer the foundation for city lay-out, structure of
industry, sea area function zoning, address of waste draining outlet selecting, etc. in littoral.
Adopting Euler-Lagrange method, by tracing the Lagrange constant of seawater particle, we can know
pollutant's movement track, migration track, residence time in sea area, source and destination, etc.
This is the important problems which to be solved for ocean environmental protection too.
6.2.3.2 Distribution of Lagranger Residual Current in Assessment Sea area
The Lagrange residual currents accepted from exonerative fluid particles at different moment are
different. So, liquid particles beginning to exonerate at different moment have different movement
trace at same spot. In this topic, by selecting Rizhao ocean station as reference port and selecting four
typical moments, that is, mean and high tide moments of flood tide, mean and neap tide moments of
ebb tide, as the initial moment of exonerative liquid current particle, we can get Lagrange residual
current of Rizhao nearshore sea area by calculating.
The Lagrange residual currents at four different moments are shown from Fig 6.2.21 to Fig 6.2.24. In
general, the Lagrange residual current structures at four different moments are basically same. More
eddy currents in low strength exist in near shore water area north of Futuan River. The directions of
residual current of the side near the mid-sea area are from northeast to southwest basically. The values
of residual currents are 2-3cm/s approximately. The maximum residual current in assessment sea area
appears in the eastside of center port water area. The value is 8.3cm/s approximately. Partial water
particles at the south border of assessment sea area migrated out of the calculating area at the mean
and neap tide moments of flood tide. Partial water particles at the north border of assessment sea area
migrated out of the calculating area at the mean and high tide moments of ebb tide too.
6.2.3.3 Forecasting the Transport trace of Waste Water Draining into Sea at Each Waste
Draining Outlet Planning to Select
We normally use marked particle's numerical tracking method for realizing the moving direction of
the pollutants which migrate following the seawater, transport way and impacting scope. After the
waste water draining into sea, they will be constantly mixed with the seawater around, diffused,
diluted, then the quality will be changed gradually, density will be decreased, finally they has the
approximate same density with the seawater around. Because the mixture ratio of waste water and
seawater around is related to the conditions of pollutant's type, waste water covered area,
hydrodynamic conditions near the waste draining outlet, etc. So quantitative expression is difficult and
numerical tracking adopts two methods by the large now: (1) Mixture ratio is zero, that is not to
consider the character of pollutant's type, density, etc, and only to consider the period-average
migrating direction and impacting scope of the sea water near the waste draining outlet; (2) Mixture
ratio is 100%, that is after waste water went into the sea, they mixed adequately with the seawater
around in process of transport, pollutant's density takes the pollutant's density value in the seawater of
the day. When pollutant's density reached the density value predetermined, then stop tracking. This
topic adopts the first method to track.

seawater of the day. When pollutant' s density reached the density value predetermined, then stop
tracking. This topic adopts the first method to track.
Forecasting the transport trace of the waste water draining into seawater, is to realize the period-
averaged migrating way of waste water, possible impacting area and scope. Waste water is drained in
different tidal hour, example, when in the flood tidal hour, it will rise first then fall and fall first then
rise in the ebb tidal hour. Initial character of current field is different when the wastewater be drained,
transport trace of waste water is different not completely too, so Lagrange migration of water particle
is the function of the draining moment.
Now selecting Rizhao ocean station as reference port and selecting four typical moments, that is mean
and high tide moments of flood tide, mean and neap tide moments of ebb tide, act as the initial
moment of marked particle' s numerical tracking. So four moments, six waste draining outlets, there
are 24 calculating schemes of waste water' s transport trace.
From Fig 6.2.25 to Fig 6.2.48 are the water particle' s numerical tracking results in different tidal
hour and different outlet. In these figure, (square frame) is the initial position of particles. In the
gridding of waste draining outlet in, set 100 marked particles, track after releasing. The marked
particle' s trace in a semidiurnal tide period is shown and the maximum migrating distance in a
period, the maximum scope impacted by water particle, is given at same time in below figure. The
marked particle' s migrating way, possible area and scope impacted in 40 semidiurnal tide periods are
shown in above figure.

The sort of the particle' s maximum migrating distance in a tidal period according to the size is:

(2) Area and scope impacted by particle in 40 semidiurnal tide periods
From Fig 6.2.25 to Fig 6.2.48, we can see the migrating ways of the water particle released in different
tidal hour at six waste draining outlets have as follows characters:
(D Water particles migrate to southwest direction after leaving the waste draining outlet, most the
distances to the waste draining outlet are more than 14km after 40 semidiurnal tide periods.
( No particle enter the port area basically
 The situation of water particle entering the port area
For '8, 110 and 1I1 outlets, there are a few particles entering the port area drained at mean moment of
ebb tide, shown in Fig 6.2.27, Fig 6.2.31 and Fig 6.2.39.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                               Environmental Assessment
Shandong Province
For I18, lIo outlets, there are a few particles entering the port area drained at mean moment of flood
tide, shown in Fig 6.2.37 and Fig 6.2.41.
For 118, there are a few particles entering the port area drained at high tide moment, shown in Fig
6.2.38.
Particles entering the port area have been fully diluted for five tidal periods, the density is lower now,
so the impact to the water quality of the port area is not obvious.
Q Situation of water particle approaching the shore
For 18 and 118 outlets, there are a part of particles approaching the shore south to the Quishanzui at four
draining moments all, shown in Figs 6.2.25-6.2.28 and Figs 6.2.37-6.2.40.
For 11o outlet, there are a part of or a few particles approaching the shore at four draining moments,
shown in Fig 6.2.29 and Fig 6.2.31.
For I,, outlet drained at neap tide moment(Fig6.2.36), for IIo outlet drained at mean moment of flood
tide(Fig 6.2.41)and for III, outlet drained at high tide moment (Fig 6.2.46), there are a part of particles
approaching the shore entirely.
The part particles approaching the shore are all diluted for ten tidal periods, so their density is very
low, can't bring obvious unfavorable impact to the water quality of water area near the shore.
t Water particle's wandering situation near the draining outlet
For 18 at high tide moment (Fig 6.2.26) and For 110 at neap tide moment (Fig 6.2.32), the water
particles still wandered near the draining outlet after 40 semidiurnal periods.
(3) Preliminary Conclusions
(D In the sea area near the six waste draining outlets, water particle's migrating average maximum
distance is in the range of 4.14-4.16km. Tidal current ellipse has a bigger ellipticity, the mixing
process of waste water and the seawater around is adequate, so the waste water can be diluted quickly.
 The water particle migrates to the mid sea basically, can't bring obvious impact to the water quality
of the port area.
(D The particle drained at some tidal period of time will approach the shore south of Kuishanzui. A
part of particles enter the port area, but the particles entering the port area and approaching the shore
are all diluted for five tidal periods, with lower density, so they can't bring unfavorable impact to
related area.

6.2.4.1 COD Density Forecast
We only forecasted the increment distribution of COD density on the condition of mean tidal current
field above. But neap tide delegates the most unfavorable situation, so we should forecast the
incremenit distributioll of COD density on the condition of neap tidal current field.

The COD volume into sea is still the forward designed volume of the waste water draining adopting
first level treatment technique.
Table 6.2.5 gives the COD density increment on the situation of two types current field. We can see
from the table, on the situation of mean tidal current field, the center density increment is 3.73mg/L,
without exceeding the water quality standard of Class III. But on the situation of neap tidal current
field, the center density increment is 4.60mg/L, increasing 18.9% than mean tide. The area exceeding
Class III standard is 0.016km2. The increment distribution of COD density on the situation of neap
tidal current field is shown in Fig 6.2.49.

Adopting Sewage discharged volume in the forward plan of Level one treatment technology to
forecast the density distribution of nitrogen under the condition of mean tide and neap tide flow
distributions.
(1) Increment Forecasting
Recommended density increments of nitrogen in waste draining outlet under two flow distributions are
shown in table 6.2.9. Under mean tide flow distribution, central density increment is 1.82 mg/L. Under
neap tide flow distance, 2.19mg/L. Fig 6.2.50 and 6.2.51 have separately showed the density
increment of inorganic nitrogeni. Under mean tide and neap tide flow distribution. We can see that the
gradient of high density line 7s big, the gradient becomes less and less along with the decreasing of
density value.

value
Because value of C3 itself is over Class 3 of water quality standard, after overlapped with the
increment, inorganic nitrogen density at C3 site are all over class III standard under the condition of
mean tide and neap tide condition. B is the highest from  draining outlet, after overlapped with
increment, its density is I.157mg/L, exceeds class III of water quality standard of 2.89 times.
6.2.4.3 Analysis of Impact on Environmental Protect Target Water Area
(1) Analysis of impact on the water area of electricity plant water in take.
Forecast the density value according to the latitude and longitude location of electricity plant water
intake provided by Rizhao construction committee.
Because monitor section A lies near the electricity plant water intake, we can regard the monitor value
of section A as the background values of electricity plant water intake. The average monitor value of
this section was overlapped with its increment to forecast the density distribution of pollutant in the
outlet. Forecasting result is shown in table 6.2.11.

After overlapped with wood pulp plant, the increments are all not over 0.01mg/L.
From above table, we know that COD and inorganic nitrogen in the water area near the electricity
plant water intake are not over class III water quality standard, this indicate that the sewage drained
from recommended outlet won't affect the water quality of electricity plant water intake.
(2) Analysis of impact on water area of culture area in Futong River
Monitor section C lies in the eastside of Futong River entrance. The monitor value in section C can be
seen as background value of water area in culture area.
The aquiculture area will carry out class II water quality standard. COD is 3 mg/L, inorganic N is
4 3 Omg/L.
From table 5.3.1 we can see that there are a few station site over the standard.
The reason for COD, inorganic N high in this area is that about 50,000 m3/d city sewage from old city
region of Rizhao flows to sea area of Futong River entrance along Gu River. If sewage treatment plant
is constructed, this 50,000m3/d sewage will be intercepted and flows along sewage pipe network to
sewage plant to treat. Water quality in Futong River entrance area will improved greatly.
