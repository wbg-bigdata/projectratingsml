Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                        Environmental Assessment
Summary
1 OVERVIEW
This report provides a brief summary of the major findings in the two Provincial Environmental
Assessment (EA) Reports produced for Anhui and Shandong Provinces, under the Huai River Water
Pollution Control Project (HRWPCP). The Provincial EA for Anhui Province was conducted by the
Hefei Design Institute (HDI), under the Ministry of Coal Industry. The Provincial EA for Shandong
Province was conducted by the Shandong Scientific Research and Design Institute of Environmental
Protection (SIEP), under the Shandong Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) in Jinan.
Both of the English versions of these EA reports were prepared with the assistance of the AC (Mott
MacDonald and ERM International).
The full Provincial EA reports cover the assessment of the environment impacts of the project
components to be undertaken under the HRWPCP in each Provinces. The EA reports were prepared
as Category B, as directed by the World Bank (WB). Full Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) were
prepared in each Province and the findings incorporated into the EA reports.
The EA reports were prepared in both Chinese and English versions. The Chinese versions of these
EAs were submitted to the Chinese State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) for approval.
Both the Anhui Provincial EA and Shandong Provincial EA were approved by SEPA in September
2000. The final English versions of the provincial EAs were submitted to the WB in August 2000.
2 HUAI RIVER BASIN
2.1 General
The Huai River Basin lies across four provinces in the centre of China, covering an area of 270,000
km2 between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers and the Yellow Sea. The Basin is divided into two
major systems: (1) The Huai River System (190,000 ki2), originating from Mt.Tongbo in Henan
Province and about 1,000 km long with 120 tributaries, flows east through Anhui Province to Hongze
Lake, through Jiangsu Province and discharges into the Yangtze River. (2) The Yi-Shu-Si River
System (80,000 km2) originates in Shandong, flows south to Jiangsu Province and discharges into the
Yellow Sea. The Grand Canal in the east connects the Huai River and Yi-Shu-Si systems as well as
the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers.
The economic and environmental impacts of water pollution on the Huai River Basin area are
widespread and acute. In 1994, severe water pollution caused temporary production stoppage at many
factories and drinking water problems for many inhabitants in the Huai River Basin. The 1994 Huai
River pollution incident was caused by the discharge of polluted wastewater from many straw pulp
factories, paper mills, and tanneries in Henan Province and Anhui Province located in the upstream
portion of the Ying He River. These industries discharged a great quantity of polluted wastewater
during the dry season when river control gates were often closed; 60-70 % of the annual river flow
occurs during May-August time period, the gates are closed during the dry season for storage
purposes. During the flood season the river control gates were opened releasing the concentrated
stored pollution. This sudden increase in pollution of downstream sections of the Ying He River
caused power station malfunction and consequently major impacts on the Hua Dong power network.
Furthermore, fishery resources were destroyed and agricultural and industrial damages were
widespread. Urban water sources were also affected resulting in significant shortages for the

Summary
inhabitants of the downstream cities. Direct economic damages were estimated at over one billion
yuan.
Consequently the State Council authorised various actions to combat water pollution and prevent
future pollution disasters in the Huai River Basin. The central government approved the "Ninth Five-
Year Plan (1996-2000) of Water Pollution Control" (WPCP) in June of 1996. The WPCP defined
targets for the Huai River Basin as follows:
*   By 1997, all the wastewater discharges from industrial pollution sources should meet
standards for effluent and the total Basin COD should be reduced from 1.5 million tons in
1993 to 0.89 million tons (including 0.207 million tons from Anhui Province and 0.264
million tons from Shandong Province);
*   By 2000, the total Basin COD should be reduced to 0.368 million tons (including 77,000
tons from Anhui Province and 64,700 tons from Shandong Province);
* By 2000, the Huai River mainstream, main tributaries, and rivers that are sources for urban
water supplies, should reach the Class m of the National Surface Water Standard.
As part of the efforts of the State Council and the four Huai basin provinces (i.e. Henan, Anhui,
Jiangsu and Shandong) to meet water pollution control targets, the Huai River Water Pollution
Control Project (HRWPCP) is currently being prepared for Anhui and Shandong Provinces. At the
request of the PRC, the WB has listed the proposed project in the lending programme for WB fiscal
year 2001. Water pollution control in Henan and Jiangsu is being dealt with under separate
programmes.
As described below, despite significant efforts, including the closure of a large number of polluting
industries, the targets listed above are far from being achieved, with provision of municipal
wastewater control facilities in particular lagging far behind programme. This project will thus be a
significant step towards achieving the proposed pollution reduction targets and, through the associated
technical assistance activities, will help to provide the necessary skills and experience to execute
further projects within the plan.
2.2 Anhui Province
Anhui Province extends over the centre of the Huai River Basin. The Huai River mainstream flows
through the centre of Anhui Province with major tributaries located both north and south. See Figure
S-1 for the locations of the Huai River mainstream and major tributaries in Anhui and Shandong
Provinces. (Note, all figures are located at the end of this Summary). The length of the mainstream of
the Huai River in the province is 420 km and the length of the tributaries is 1,580 km.
River pollution is mainly organic, with sections in urban reaches being more polluted than rural reaches,
and pollution in tributaries being more serious than in the mainstream reaches.
Anhui Province is approximately 139,400 krn2, of which 66,940 km2 is located within the Huai River
Basin (24.8% of the total basin area). The total 1998 population of Anhui Province was 61.3 million,
with 11.2 million in urban areas, of this, 34.7 million were within the Huai River Basin including 4.6
million in urban areas.

Summary
2.3 Shandong Province
Shandong Province includes most of the Yi-Shu-Si System of the Huai River Basin. This system is
hydrologically connected to the Huai River via the Grand Canal but actually flows directly to the
Yellow Sea. Pollution is mainly organic, with sections in urban reaches being more polluted than rural
reaches.
Shandong Province is approximately 156,700 km2, of which 47,100 km2 is located within the Huai
River Basin (17.4% of the total basin area). The total 1998 population of Shandong Province was
86.10 million, with 23 rnillion in urban areas. Of this, about 30 million were within the Huai River
Basin including 1.2 million in urban areas.
3 HRWPCP PROJECT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
In order to fully solve the pollution problems in the two provinces, major pollution control schemes
will need to be developed for most cities. It is not possible to finance all necessary works in one step.
It is therefore foreseen that further phases of the HRWPCP will be needed over the coming years.
In accordance with the national WB policies and priorities, the Anhui and Shandong Provincial
Governments have requested WB and bi-lateral donor support for the Huai River Water Pollution
Control Project. The HRWPCP is also a key element of China's Agenda 21 programme. The sector-
related goal for the project is:
Improve quality of water for the entire basin by providing environmental
infrastructure operated in a sustainable manner
The HRWPCP objectives are to:
1. Upgrade water quality in the Huai River (Class El[ target) and its tributaries (Class IV
target) within the two provinces.
2. Establish performing and efficient wastewater agencies.
3. Consolidate water quality monitoring systems and procedures.
To accomplish this goal and objectives, the outputs for each project component are:
1. Increase in municipal wastewater collection.
2. Increase in quantity of wastewater treated.
3. Implementation of cost-recovery for wastewater operations.
4. Improved water quality monitoring systems and procedures.
4 NEED FOR THE PROJECT
According to the draft "3H Basins Action Program Study for Water Resources, Water Pollution
Control" prepared in November 1999 for the Ministry of Water Resources and the WB (known as the
'3H Study since it covers the Hai, Huai, and Huang rivers), the WPCP goals have not been met in the
Huai River basin. This report indicates that significant additional resources are required to meet the
Class 11/IV river target standards of the WPCP, and that rural sources such as uncontrolled township
and village enterprises (TVEs) and non-point source pollution (mainly polluted agricultural and urban
surface water runoff) will remain a problem even after implementation of industrial controls and
domestic wastewater treatment facilities.

Huai River Wawer Pollution Control Project                          Environmental Assessment
Summary
Implementation of industrial and domestic wastewater treatment lags behind the WPCP
implementation schedule due to funding problems. The main pollutants are unionised ammonia, BOD,
COD and bacteria levels, and the problems are especially acute in the dry seasons when background
flows are reduced to at or near zero levels. Environmental resources are minimal and the assimilative
capacity of the surface waters during low-flow periods is virtually zero.
In summnary, the water quality problems in the Huai River Basin remain severe, the implementation of
municipal wastewater treatment facilities has been slow, and the HRWPCP is targeted to support a
major need.
It is the national goal to have wastewater collection and secondary treatment facilities constructed in
all cities within the Huai River Basin. A number of the cities in the basin have completed or are
currently building wastewater collection and treatment facilities with international bi-lateral
assistance. The HRWPCP is designed to help meet overall basin objectives by supplementing these
ongoing efforts in the larger cities of Anhui and Shandong provinces that have not been addressed by
other projects.
In 1999, the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences (CRAES) selected 45 major
stations to investigate the current water quality of the Huai River Basin. Data from national
environmental water quality reports between 1986 and 1993, 1994 for the Huai mainstream, 1995 to
1996 for trans-boundary assessments and some incomplete data from 1997 and 1998 were used by
CRAES to determine the existing water quality of the river basin. CRAES (1999) reported that of the
45 sections, only 4 reached their designated beneficial use classification.
Pacific Consultants and the Danish Hydraulic Institute in 1999 estimated the total COD loading in
Anhui Province as of 1997 at over 363,000 t/a. Data on year 2000 loading is difficult to obtain and
verify, but it is likely closer to this 1997 estimate than to the WPCP goal for 2000 in Anhui Province
of 77,000 tla. The Anhui HRWPCP treatment facilities (Luan and Guoyang) will remove
approximately 7,008 t/a of COD (ultimate WwTW sizing removes 11,498 t/a of COD), while the
related bi-lateral treatment facilities will remove an additional 48,618 t/a of COD. This total ultimate
COD removal of 60,116 t/a can be seen to be a good start for Anhui Province, but far short of the
overall WPCP needs in the province.
It is undoubtedly true that the total COD loading in 1997 in Shandong Province also exceeds the
WPCP goals, but verifiable data is not readily available. Although municipal and industrial
wastewater loads were included in the plan goal for 1997, the WPCP did not account for the "other"
sources of COD in the basin. In addition, the progress in achieving municipal and industrial pollution
control since 1997 has lagged behind plan goals so that the year 2000 goals of 64,700 tons for
Shandong province have not been met. SIEP estimates that the current year 2000 COD loading in
Shandong Province is approximately 213,000 t/year, including TVEs and non-point source pollution.
The HRWPCP projects will remove approximately 37,145 t/year of COD, leaving the overall
Shandong loading well in excess of the target of 67,400 t/year.
5 THE PRIORITISATION OF SCHEMES
Provision of municipal wastewater collection and treatment facilities in the cities of the Huai River
Basin is a priority action item in the WPCP, and a critical component shown in the 3H Rivers Action
S-4                              September 2000

Summary
Plan. The WPCP anticipated that much of the construction of wastewater collection and treatment
facilities would be completed by the year 2000, but the programme is running well behind schedule.
Table S-1 provides a listing of the cities and overall municipal treatment needs in the Huai River
Basin, as shown in the 3H Action Plan. The project cities supported by the HRWPCP in Anhui and
Shandong provinces are highlighted. Table S-1 illustrates the enormous backlog of municipal
wastewater treatment needs in the Basin that require additional funding.
Thus the HRWPCP is part of a much larger comprehensive effort to control industrial and municipal
pollution in the Huai Basin. This project has been designed to complement the activities already
underway in order to move more quickly toward WPCP goals.

Figures S-2 to S-9 provide schematics of the proposed Anhui project components. It is proposed to
take thickened and dewatered sludge from the WwTW at Guoyang and Lu'an to sanitary landfill sites
near the cities.
The Anhui Component also includes a sub-component to strengthen the capability of the Anhui
Environmental Monitoring Centres operated by the Provincial and municipal EPBs. The sub-
component will include rehabilitation of laboratory facilities, water quality sampling and analysis
equipment and training.
6.2   Shandong Province
Shandong Province is currently proposing four municipal wastewater schemes and one industrial
pollution control sub-component for inclusion in the HRWPCP. All the municipal wastewater
schemes involve improvement and extension of existing sewerage networks and three include new
WwTWs. Most of the sub-components also include operation and maintenance equipment including
laboratory equipment and vehicles. The Rizhao City component also includes construction of sea
outfalls. One of the cities, Ju County, already has a WwTW under construction using local funding.
Hence, this WwTW is outside of this project.
The sewerage schemes will involve both the interception of existing municipal sewage and industrial
wastewater outfalls and provision of first wastewater collection in more recently developed areas of
the cities. Wastewater will be conveyed to WwTWs and will make a major contribution to control of
water pollution in the Huai River Basin, and in the case of Rizhao, control pollution in off-shore
waters and nearby bathing beaches. Table S-3 shows the project details that are proposed for the
HRWPCP in Shandong Province:

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                           Environnmental Assessment
Summary
Of particular relevance to the EA, the project includes an overall environmental strengthening
component in the area of environmental monitoring. This strengthening is aimed at improving the
Basin wide ability to monitor and report on environmental condition, as well as providing the means
to better assess the environmental performance of the project investment package. This component
would be implemented under the Huai River Basin Commission.
7 WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES
All surface waters in China have been classified according to ambient stream standards. The
following is a general translation of the surface water classes:
Class        Description
I          used for water sources and state nature reserves
II         used for class I protection areas for drinking water sources, protection zones
for valuable fish, spawning grounds of fish and shrimps
III        used for class II protection areas for drinking water sources, general
protection zones for fish and bathing areas [Huai River mainstream target]
IV         used for general industrial water areas and water recreation areas where no
direct contact with hurans occurs [Major tributary target]
V          used for agricultural water areas and scenic water areas.
A new Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water, GHZB-1 1999, was issued on July 20,
1999, and became effective on January 1, 2000. This new standard replaced the previous GB3838-88
standard. The parameters of most significance to the HRWPCP wastewater schemes are shown
below:
Parameter (mg/I)            Class III           Class IV
Non-ionic ammonia          0.02                 0.2
D.O. (Min.)                5.0                  3.0
CODa                       20                   30
BOD5                       4.0                  6.0
8 PROJECT BENEFITS AND IMPACTS
8.1  Project Benefits
Public health projects like the HRWPCP carry many general benefits for the citizens of the project
cities. The project feasibility and EA reports outline specific benefits including:
*     Raising the output of agricultural, fish and livestock production;
*      Increased domestic output due to improved water resources;
*     Public health improvements;
*      Increased revenue from tourism;
*      Increased real estate values;
*      Improved surface water quality.
Other additional potential benefits might include:
*     Reduced risk of groundwater contamination in the service areas.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                                                  Environmental Assessnient
Summary
*        The impact of making  realistic charges for wastewater services should  help  to
encourage waste minimisation at source, and intemalise the costs of pollution control.
*        Amenity benefits to the population of project cities are likely to accrue as the quality
of the adjacent rivers improve. This could include use of the river for recreational
purposes and the development of riverside walks and parks for public use.
8.2    Social Impacts
Resettlement and compensation plans have been prepared and are covered in separate "Resettlement
Action Plans" (RAP) for each province. The final Anhui Province RAP was prepared for the WB at
the same time as the EA and the summary is shown in Table S-5.

8.3 Environmental Impacts
During the construction period, there are potential impacts on the social environment, natural
environment and living quality and these are generally temporary and relatively minor. Construction
of wastewater collection and treatment facilities will inevitable cause some disruption to traffic and
local communities. The project will also affect noise and air quality of the immediate surrounding
areas. Construction will also impact on sidewalk trees, vegetation and rainfall inlets

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                          Environmental Assessment
Summary
Mitigation measures for the construction period have been built into the project and these should
enable the unfavourable effects to be minimised or eliminated entirely. These mitigation measures are
based on international approaches to similar problems elsewhere. For disruption to local communities
involving temporary and permanent land acquisition the RAP include detailed measures for
compensation and livelihood restoration in accordance with PRC laws and WB policy.
These construction impacts have been sorted according to their geographic location within the overall
project. Details of mitigation measures, the monitoring required to ensure that mitigation measures are
effectively implemented, and responsibilities are provided in detailed charts within the Consolidated
EAs. HRWPCP PMOs will have an ongoing responsibility to track and report the monitoring work of
all the identified agencies, in addition to their own direct monitoring activities.
The potential operational phase impacts are relatively minor and easily mitigated. Many of the
concems have been addressed in the course of the design of the wastewater collection and wastewater
treatment facilities. Details of mitigation measures, a programme for monitoring mitigation measures
and responsibilities are provided in detailed charts in the Provincial EAs.
Potential impacts that were evaluated included:
*     Raw sewage discharges and intermittent operation of overflows;
*     Industrial wastewater influent problems (WwTW upsets, sewer corrosion);
-    Noise problems at pump stations and WwTWs;
*     Odour problems;
-     Air Quality impacts;
*     Treated effluent impacts at outfall locations;
*     Sludge treatment and disposal;
*     Improper O&M of WwTWs.
The financial analysis for HRWPCP components indicates that they are affordable for the
stakeholders (municipal governments, service population and industries). This project is meeting a
"backlog" need for environmental infrastructure and should not induce adverse extensive growth or
secondary impacts. The present environmental problems are serious and the provision of this
environmental infrastructure is necessary for current needs and to mitigate current problems. Future
problems without the project would become even more critical.
9 ALTERNATIVES REVIEWED IN PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
The evaluation of alternatives for individual project components covered issues such as:
*      Sewerage system interception ratio;
*     Pipe materials;
*     Pipeline construction;
*     Number of pump stations and pressure mains;
*     Number of WwTWs;
*     WwTW site selection;
*     Wastewater flows and capacity of the WwTWs;

10 MITIGATION AND MONITORING
10.1 Mitigation and Monitoring Budget
The capital budgets prepared for HRWPCP components include allowances for laboratory
construction and equipment for use by the wastewater companies. Use of this equipment to perform
the necessary testing by the wastewater company is also included in the operations budget for the
project.
Furthermore, accomplishing the specified monitoring and reporting outlined in this mitigation plan
will be greatly enhanced by the TA programme. This TA programme will also allow for improved
overall performance assessment of the HRWPCP programme relative to meeting the project
objectives. Future phases of the HRWPCP will benefit from such assessments.
Despite the above facilities and training the conduct of the mitigation monitoring programme will
require additional funding. Cost estimates to cover long-term environmental monitoring have been
estimated. "Long-term" is defined as annual monitoring required to verify the environmental
performance and other operational mitigation measures previously outlined. These mitigation
monitoring costs have been. added to the wastewater company operational cost estimates. Costs for
mitigation measures that relate to the management of construction will be included in the tender
documents and responsibility passed on to the construction contractors.

10.2 Annual Environmental Quality Report
The recommended environmental monitoring programme is important during both the construction
and initial operation phases of the project and involves participants from both the sub-component and
provincial levels. The results of this environmental monitoring programme will be summarised in an
Annual Environmental Quality Report (AEQR) for each Province, which is distributed to all relevant
project offices as well as the World Bank. The charts in the beginning of the mitigation and
monitoring chapter of each provincial EA provide convenient checklists for these reports.
At the beginning of January every year, each PIU will sort the relative monitoring data and provide it
to their provincial PMO. The Provincial PMO will then consolidate the data in an AEQR. The
minimum information that should be reported in an AEQR is shown in Table S-9.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                         Environmental Assessment
Summary
11 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
During the 12-month project development time leading up to this provincial consolidated EA, there
have been many meetings with the city PIUs, utility companies, city EPBs and other affected city
organisations to discuss the proposed projects and preparation of the sub-component environmental
assessment reports. These meetings have occurred monthly at a minimum and have resulted in full
collaboration with local officials and full support of the project and the EA process. It is estimated
that in total 3040 meetings have been held with the public and over 50 meetings have been held with
local government officials during the development of the projects, in both of the HRWPCP provinces.
HDI also prepared a survey form to gauge the public perception of the positive and negative impacts
of each of the proposed projects in Anhui Province. The investigation was made with representatives
of the local government sectors, People's Congress, political consultative conference, women's
federation, communist youth league, trade union and other organisations, as well as urban residents'
comrnittee. The survey results showed widespread support for the HRWPCP in all Anhui cities.
In Shandong Province, SIEP undertook public participation activities included random opinion
sampling questionnaires and holding meetings/conferences in order to inform and obtain suggestions
from the public. These activities involved both representatives of local government sectors (similar
groups to those used by HDI in Anhui) and also villages, factories and enterprises near the proposed
WwTWs. The public included workers, farmers and students etc. of different ages, professions and
educational levels. The public participation results showed widespread support for the HRWPCP in
all Shandong cities.
In addition, each PIU announced project infornation using local newspapers, TV, etc. The public was
able to inspect the sub-component and consolidated EA reports or summaries of these reports at local
locations arranged by the sub-component PIU, and express their views on the proposed projects.
The many meetings with public officials in the province coupled with the surveys of public support
show that these projects are considered to have large positive benefits and are well received by the
public. Comments received have been addressed, for example, comments that adequate compensation
should be assessed for acquired land have been fully addressed in the RAPs. No objections have been
received by the city PIU's and there is no indication that there is anyone that is not is support of these
projects or would try to stop their completion.
Details of the public participation events including time, place, attendees and issues are provided in
the consolidated EAs for Shandong and Anhui respectively.
12 OVERALL HRWPCP PROJECT ASSESSMENT
The HRWPCP projects have been properly formulated and they will form an important contribution
to the achievement of the goals of the WPCP. The construction of WwTWs in the Huai River Basin
has lagged behind the planned schedule of the WPCP, making it more important to accelerate WwTW
construction. Significant progress has been made in regard to the control of industrial pollution since
the WPCP was formulated. However, domestic wastewater collection and treatment remains well
behind the WPCP schedule.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                             Environmental Assessment
Summary
With respect to environmental protection, the general urban plan and the drainage project plan, the
design of wastewater facilities and the locations selected for proposed pump stations and treatment
works for HRWPCP projects in the Anhui and Shandong project cities has proved to be reasonable.
The locations of the WwTWs meet the requirements of the local urban plans and environmental
protection. For the Chengwu Paper Mill, project altematives have been comprehensively assessed,
and the proposed project is technically superior and cost-effective.
12.1 COD Removed, Anhui Province
HDI predicted the reduction in COD discharged to the Huai River Basin for the two HRWPCP
WwTWs is shown in Table S-10 and in Table S-11 for all HRWPCP cities, both in the "near future"
(with existing World Bank and bi-lateral WwTW) and the "further future" (assuming all municipal
WwTW needs have been met in the cities.
Table S-10: Estimated COD Reductions for HRWPCP WwTWs

Sub-components    Quantity    Discharge before  Discharge after  etia)  Amount of CODcr

Note that HDI analyses in the Chinese EA used these higher WwTW capacities for the two WwTWs
at Guoyang and Luan based on the SDPC approval documents. The proposed capacities of these
HRWPCP WwTWs were reduced 40,000 m3/day, which reduces the COD removal rate to 3,650 t/a at
Luan and 3,358 t/a at Guoyang (total reduction for both WwTW therefore 7,008 t/a). Similarly,
Table S-11 uses the SDPC proposed WwTW capacities in these cities. Using the actual proposed
capacities reduces the short-term COD removal in the Province by about 4,400 t/a.

12.2 COD Removed, Shandong Province
Feicheng, Heze, Rizhao City and Ju County in Shandong Province will benefit from improved urban
surface water quality after construction of sewerage and WwTWs. In the case of Rizhao City, the
adjacent sea water quality will also be improved with benefits to fisheries and important tourist
bathing beaches.  The improved wastewater treatment systems at the Chengwu Paper Mill will
significantly reduce current levels of pollution discharging to the Dong Yu River benefiting
downstream commnunities.
After the HRWPCP is implemented the situation with respect to COD, discharges will be as
shown in Table S-12.

Sunmmary
Based on the maximum permitted COD discharge for each COD control section in Table S-12, the
COD discharged before the HRWPCP is implemented and the distance between the sewage discharge
site and the control section, it can be seen that without the HRWPCP, the COD discharged to the
control section of the receiving rivers will exceed the COD standard.
The construction of the project will have great effect on the realising of total volume control target in
Huai River Basin administrated by Shandong. Table S-13 provides the SEEP estimates of COD
reductions associated with HRWPCP projects.

From Table S-14, it can be seen that the COD concentration in the river near the proposed WwTWs
will be greatly reduced by the HRWPCP. During the low flow period the Zhushui River will be able
to reach Class V standard and during the flood period the Kangwang River will be able to reach Class
IV. However, the Kangwang, Dongyu and Shu (Ju County) rivers will still not be able to attain better
than Class V for all flow periods, although they can satisfy the water quality requirement of fannland
irrigation. (wet farming: COD<200 mg/I; dry fanning: COD<3WO mg/I; vegetable COD<l50mgAl).

From Table S-15, the water quality of the control section of the receiving river will be improved by
varying degrees following implementation of each municipal WwTW and Chengwu sub-project. In
particular, after the alkali recovery and wastewater wastewater treatment plant of Chengwu paper mill
has been put into operation, the mill's wastewater effluent will reach the required discharge standard
and the water quality of the Dongyu River (Xuzhai section) will be improved significantly.
The water quality of Shu River (Xiazhuang section) and Zhuzhaoxin River (Yulou section) will also
be improved by varying degrees after finishing the WwTW of Ju County (WwTW not WB funded)
and Heze. However, because of the longer distance (approximate 100km) between Feicheng WwTW
and the Wangtai bridge section of Daqing River and the relatively small quantity of wastewater
treated by the WwTW compared to the flow of the Daqing River, its ability to significantly improve
the water quality of the Daqing River after finishing the project is limited.
The discharge quantity of COD,C meets the requirement of the Total Quantity Control index made by
the provincial government. So the construction of project will play an active role in reaching the
target of Total Quantity Control in the Huai River Basin of Shandong province. However, the
HRWPCP cannot attain the total control indicators on its own in the short-term, and significant
additional investment is required for both point and non-point source pollution to allow the Shandong
river reaches to meet the water quality targets.
13 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
1. The environmental conditions are serious and the environmental infrastructure needs of Anhui
and Shandong Provinces are extensive and continue to expand rapidly.
2. The HRWPCP projects have emerged from  a basin-wide prioritisation process, are well
formulated, and have detailed feasibility stage designs and cost estimates.
3. There is good public support for the projects based on meetings in the project cities and public
opinion surveys.

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                           Environmental Assessment
Summary
4. The proposed projects can meet financial and economic tests of sustainability and are affordable
to the local citizens.
5. Social impacts, consisting mainly of land acquisition and resettlement, are addressed by detailed
RAPs, and, in any case, are not significantly adverse.
6. The potential environmental benefits of the HRWPCP are large, as reported in the previous
sections. However, there are significant additional point and non-point water quality controls
necessary as well as a need to maintain or augment existing minimum stream-flows, before the
WPCP goals can be realised in the Basin.
7. Potential construction and operational phase impacts of the HRWPCP have been adequately
assessed and no major issues have been identified. Detailed mitigation actions and monitoring
procedures have been prepared which should adequately minimise any effect of these potential
impacts. Monitoring costs have been included for this work and assignments detailed.
8. The recommendations included herein by the Hefei Design Institute are rational and should be
considered in the design and construction of these projects. These recommendations included:
e     HDI suggests that the related sectors relax the phosphorus discharge standards for the
two proposed WwTWs. [The Anhui Provincial EPB have agreed to the proposed
effluent standards and specific facilities for phosphorus removal are not included in
the design. If required, chemically assisted phosphorus removal can be implemented
easily at a later date].
*     HDI recommends that further treatment of effluent be considered before the effluent
is used directly for agricultural irrigation water supply. [The HRWPCP projects are
designed for direct discharge, so this recomrendation is considered one for the future
if direct land application of effluent is proposed by the project cities.]
9. The recommendations included herein by the Shandong Research and Design Institute are rational
and should be considered in the design and construction of these projects. These
recommendations included:
*     Main plants discharging pollutants in the service area of WwTW should improve spot
pollution source control. The concentration of wastewater discharge should attain the
standard for discharge to sewers;
*     Other cities in Huai River Basin of Shandong Province should built WwTWs as soon
as possible.
*     Tertiary wastewater treatment equipment should be constructed in order to improve
treatment further when the economic conditions allow. Tertiary wastewater treatment
provides positive conditions for safe reusing of treated wastewater.
*      It is suggested that secondary biochemical treatment technique should be adopted
when the second phase of construction of Rizhao WwTW is being carried out.
10. The overall conclusion is that the potential positive impacts are large, the potential negative
construction and operation impacts can be successfully mitigated, and the projects contain no

Huai River Water Pollution Control Project                          Environmental Assessment
Summary
serious problems or "fatal flaws" in its formulation. The project components are essentially
environmentally positive and should be approved.
14 ONGOING ACTIVITIES
The enormous pollution loads, both point and non-point, in the Huai River Basin, coupled with the
monsoon rain pattern that causes little stream baseflow during the dry season, make the realisation of
the national goals for the Basin difficult. The HRWPCP is a critical step on the road to making these
goals a reality, but a wide range of additional activities and interventions will be necessary in
conjunction with, or following the HRWPCP. The 3H Action Plan is an ongoing effort to develop
"big-picture" planning for the Huai River Basin, along with the Hai and Huang River Basins. Basin-
wide water quality modelling efforts are also underway to provide better predictive tools to assess the
impacts and cost-effectiveness of proposed interventions.
Due to the large backlog of water pollution control needs shown in the 3H Action Plan, it is likely that
the HRWPCP will be only the beginning of a long-term investment programme for environmental
infrastructure in the Basin. Further phases of the HRWPCP will benefit from the work contained in
the 3H Action Plan, the basin-wide water quality modelling work, the improved water quality
monitoring program, and the preparation work for this project. Some of the problems that may be
considered in the future are the backlog of municipal and industrial treatment projects, the TVEs and
other rural sources including non-point source pollution, as well as water rights management and
other structural and non-structural methods to improve the seasonal low-flow problems in the basin.
