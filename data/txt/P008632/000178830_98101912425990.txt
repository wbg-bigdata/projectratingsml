I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Geography, Economic Development and the Transport Sector
1.01       Historically, Portugal has looked outward to the sea.  Separated
from Spain by a belt of thinly populated, barren country, the boundary between
the two countries lies near the point where it becomes easier to go downhill
to the west coast than uphill and across the plateau to the main economic
center of Spain. Economic development and the transport network reflect the
country's seaward outlook and are concentrated along the western coastal plain
in a 316 km corridor between Lisbon and Oporto. The transport network is much
less dense in the south and east where economic activity is less developed and
where the terrain is much more difficult.
1.02       Although total land traffic has expanded rapidly in recent years
(para. 1.03), the transport network has remained essentially constant. No
additions to the basic rail network of 3,500 km has occurred in the last
decade, and the national highway network has also remained essentially the
same. However, overall the highway network is sufficiently extensive to serve
all parts of the country including the lesser developed regions, reflecting a
government program during the 1950s and 60s of linking every village, down to
those with only 100 inhabitants, to the main road network.
1.03      Most of the expansion in land traffic has occurred on the high-
ways. Between 1970 and 1977 interurban road passenger traffic, in terms of
passenger-km grew at an annual rate of somewhat over 5 percent per annum.
However, this included a drastic slowdown in the growth rate between 1974 and
1977, which was only about 3 percent on an annual basis compared to about 7
percent per annum between 1970 and 1974. 1/  During the period 1970 through
1976 railway passenger traffic grew at about 4 percent per annum, or about 6
percent per annum in terms of passenger-km.  However, the two figures are not
strictly comparable since nearly half of the railway passenger traffic was
suburban-urban in nature, average length for all rail passenger travel being
only 27 kilometers in 1970 and 31 kilometers in 1976.  However, the real
disparity in growth of traffic between road and rail occurred in freight
movement. Between 1970 and 1976 the ton-kilometers of rail freight grew
irregularly at an average annual rate of less than 1 percent. During the
same period, according to partial indicators, road freight traffic grew
some 5 to 6 percent annually.
B.   The Transport System
1.04       Continental Portugal's basic transport system includes the two major
ports of Lisbon and Oporto, about 3,550 km of rail line, some 34,000 km of
national and local roads and highways (not including those local roads which
1/   This may also represent a drop from passenger traffic growth in the
late 1960s, which has been estimated at about 12 percent per annum
on a passenger-km basis.

are more properly classified as streets), about 4,500 km of forest roads, and
three airports capable of handling modern international jet traffic.
(a) Highways
1.05      The highway sub-sector is discussed in Chapter II.
(b) Ports
1.06      In spite of direct land access to Europe through Spain, the inter-
national movement of goods to and from Portugal is almost completely by sea.
Portugal has some 19 officially designated ports. However, of the approxi-
mately 25 million tons of cargo, including 11 million tons of liquid cargo
(1977 figures) handled in all the ports, the ports of Lisbon, Leixoes (the
main port of Oporto) and Setubal handled over 23 million tons in total
including all of the liquid cargo. Lisbon is the major port in Portugal, with
almost one-half of all cargo passing through the port. A new deep water port
and refinery is now coming "on stream" at Sines, 80 km south of Lisbon. This
port will concentrate mainly on petroleum related projects.
1.07      Administratively, the ports of Portugal have considerable autonomy,
operate with reasonable efficiency and have been able to finance current
investments from their own resources. With new investments now under way,
or committed, including a new container terminal in Lisbon, the ports, gen-
erally will have adequate basic capacity for traffic in the immediate future
although considerable investment probably will be required to modernize
cargo handling and transhipment facilities.
1.08      A number of the vessels in international trade call at both Lisbon
and Oporto. However, although the available data is fragmentary, the actual
movement of dry cargo between the various mainland ports, including Lisbon
and Oporto, appears to be relatively small. The long term potential of
coastal shipping, however, needs to be explored in the context of national
transport planning (para. 1.16).
(c) Civil Aviation
1.09      With the exception of the jet airport at Funchal on the island of
Madeira airport facilities are generally adequate for current traffic although
air travel has grown rapidly in recent years. The increased price of fuel,
which is beginning to be reflected in air fares, may slow this increase but
some upgrading of national airports facilities will undoubtedly be required
in the near future, although this is only critical at Funchal. Because of
severe topographic constraints, it is not at all certain that the undoubtedly
necessary lengthening of the runway at Funchal is practical. However, the
nearby island of Porto Santo has a substantially longer, and adequate, runway,
but not much in the way of support facilities. A study of the general problem
is now underway.
1.10      Because of the small size of Portugal the national airline,
Transportes Aereos Portugueses (TAP), maintains only two domestic routes in



- 3 -
continental Portugal, between Lisbon and Oporto and between Lisbon and Faro
(in the Algarve).  TAP also regularly services the Azores, Madeira and Porto
Santo.  A subsidiary of TAP, Transjportes Aereos Continentais (TAC) provides
an air taxi service and charter flights throughout Portuga-L.
(d) Railways
1.11      The network of the Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses (CP) consists
of just over 2,800 route-km of broad-gauge (i.e., Spanish gauge) 1/ track
and just over 750 route-km of meter-gauge track. Of the broad-gauge lines,
approximately 400 route-km are double track and electrified to provide cor-
ridor service between Lisbon and Oporto and commuter services from the suburbs
to those cities. CP was nationalized in 1975 and, although administratively
autonomous, is now responsible to the Ministry of Transportation and Communi-
cations. A program of rehabilitation of track and rolling stock has been
in progress for several years and the condition of the main lines and their
maintenances is now adequate. Modernization of rolling stock continues and
steam traction has now been eliminated from the broad gauge system and reduced
on the narrow gauge. However, the condition of the narrow gauge system and
rolling stock is increasingly unsatisfactory and, even on the main broad
gauge lines, many bridges needs strengthening.
1.12       In the recent past poor condition of physical assets, deficiencies
in organization, planning and marketing, and low quality service have inhib-
ited the growth of rail traffic. Many problems remain, especially the poor
condition of physical assets, but recently the CP has shown a new aggressive-
ness in seeking to expand its share of the transport market. For example, the
improved service between Lisbon and Oporto has led to diversion of passenger
traffic from air travel, with a consequent demand so high that CP has recently
been unable to completely meet it. Nevertheless, freight traffic has remained
essentially stagnant at about 4 million tons, though expanding slightly in
terms of ton-km from 800 million to 900 million over the last decade (para.
1.03). Most of the freight traffic is between Lisbon and Oporto and consists
mainly of fertilizer, cement and grain and is governed by tariff rates, set by
law, which do not meet CP's costs.
1.13       The biggest problem currently facing CP is its poor financial con-
dition. The CP has experienced large and increasing deficits for several
years with revenues insufficient to cover even the wage bill and currently
only about equal to interest on short term borrowings.  The present deficit
is largely the result of increasing costs, failure to increase tariffs suf-
ficiently, and the retention of surplus staff and some uneconomic lines due
to social considerations and Government policies.

European standard of 4 feet 8-1/2 inches).



- 4-
1.14      In the meantime the CP has suggested the closing of a number of
lines in the South which are used primarily for grain transport, but the
government has not made a policy decision on this. The CP has also, in the
last year, reduced services in about 80 stations, an area in which much of
what CP considers excess personnel is concentrated. These stations continue
to accept cargo, but trains do not make stops, the goods being trucked to
other, nearby stations, where the trains do stop. Further, since January
1977, the CP has reduced its overall workforce by 1,500 through attrition
(which is politically acceptable, while outright firing is not). The vigorous
new management expects to further improve operations by combining departments
and further reducing staff at a politically acceptable pace since the CP
generally remains overstaffed.
C.   Transport Policy, Planning, Organization, Regulation and Investments
(a) Policy and Planning
1.15      Transport policy and planning over the years have been largely on
an ad hoc basis. However, a number of decrees have addressed themselves to
transportation problems and policy in the last few years, stressing coor-
dinated, long-range transport planning as the basis for transport policy and
an office of Studies and Planning has been established in the Ministry of
Transport and Communications (MTC) with the formal responsibility for trans-
port planning at the national level. Nevertheless, such planning is hardly
underway.
1.16      Aware of the need for transport planning, the Government requested
the bank to include a technical assistance component in the First Highway
Project not only for the development of a national transport plan by the
MTC but also to the Junta Autonoma de Estradas (JAE) 1/ for highway planning
and to the CP for railway planning. The overall objective of this assistance,
which is now underway, is to help in the development of a national framework
for transport investment based on economic priorities in the context of the
overall, multi-modal, transport network.
(b) Organization and Regulation
1.17      At the present time the Government has control of the CP, TAP and
most of the merchant marine through ownership, and network control (construc-
tion and maintenance) of the national highway system.  The Government, through
nationalization of the Portuguese-owned banks and some industries, has also
acquired indirect operating control of a portion of the trucking industry.
1/   The JAE is under the Ministry of Housing and Public Works rather than the
MTC.



- 5 -
Government also directly nationalized the ten largest independent "public" 1/
enterprises. However, this only resulted in direct ownership of about 10% of
the "public" trucking capacity, which would appear to be considerably less, in
total, than is controlled by the Government indirectly through ownership of
industries and banks.
1.18      Entry into the road haulage field is not formally restricted,
although it can be controlled by licensing. At the present time "private"
(industry-owned, and restricted to haulage of that firm's cargo 2/) get
licenses virtually automatically, and small "public" truckers virtually
automatically although there are some constraints on the importation of
trucks related to balance of payment problems. The Government had indi-
cated, several years ago, that it would promote the formation of trucking
cooperatives but has yet to really push their formation. Furthermore, there
is generally no Government control of road tariffs, haulage rates being set,
in the "public" sector (and the subrosa "private" haulage of "public" cargo),
by market forces. The technical assistance on transport planning to the MTC
under the First Highway Project addresses itself to Government control on
road tariffs.
(c) Investments
1.19      The Government of Portugal uses a general fund method of public
finance to meet most of its outlays, although the accepted concept is that
public enterprises should be self-supporting. Nevertheless, it has been
necessary for much of the recent capital investment for the public transport
enterprises (of which the CP is the major entity) to be supported from the
general budget. The railway operation also receives a subsidy from the Land
Transport Fund, which is partially "self-financed" in that a portion of the
funds came from railway traffic taxes, but which also receives monies from
motor vehicle taxes. 3/  Another exception (to the general fund method of
financing) has been the Auto Estradas which have been financed as toll
roads (para 2.08) as has the "Ponte (bridge) 25 de Abril" across the River
Tejo at Lisbon. Consequently, general budget totals of funds spent on the
1/   There are two types of road transport service by trucks in Portugal.
"Public" trucks are commercial vehicles which are for hire, "private"
trucks are owned by an industrial or service firm and can only carry
goods of that firm. Ninety percent of the truck fleet is estimated to be
"private", possibly because taxes on such vehicles are significantly
lower than on "public" (for hire) vehicles.
2/   Although they are not legally supposed to haul "outside" cargo many do,
especially when they would ordinarily have to travel "empty" on a return
trip. The authorities recognize the economic rationality of this, and
are reviewing the whole question of trucking industry controls.
3/   Most of the land transport taxes presently come from fuel taxes, but
some of these taxes have also been going into a general fund for food
subsidization.

transport sector tend to understate actual expenditures. Nevertheless, trans-
portation has accounted for about 20% of the general budget capital expendi-
tures over the last decade. Government outlays for national highways, both
capital and operating, have had a varied pattern in relation to overall
national budget totals but in general have been quite modest. In the 1960s
they ranged between 1.3 and 2.5% of the national budgetary totals, and from
1970 through 1976 were fairly constant at around 2%, ranging from a low of
1.9% in 1973 to a high of 2.6% in 1971. In 1976 the expenditures for
national highways amounted to just 2% of the national budget.
D.   Previous Projects in the Transport Sector
1.20      The only previous Bank project in the transport sector for Portugal
has been the First Highway Project which consisted of: (a) a three-year
(1978-1980) time slice of the rehabilitation program for national roads,
primarily in the Lisbon region; (b) the purchase of highway maintenance and
workshop equipment to improve routine maintenance of national roads in the
Lisbon region; (c) construction and supervision of a 14.3 km two-lane bypass
road near Covilha; (d) the provision of consultants' services to assist in
transportation planning and to improve operational procedures and planning of
the railways' and highways' administration; and (e) post graduate training of
three JAE staff members.
1.21      Although it took 9 months before the First Highway Project become
effective (to the Board on October 7, 1976, declared effective on July 8,
1977) it is now proceeding satisfactorily. Nevertheless, the delay in action
by Parliament (needed to achieve effectiveness) on the First Highway Project
was responsible for a concomitant delay in the implementation of the project
since it was not considered prudent or legal by the Government agencies to
take any action until such approval was secured. This condition still exists.
However, as the Government has gained experience in dealing with the Bank
things have moved more expeditiously and, barring unforeseen political cir-
cumstances, effectiveness of the proposed project could be expected to be
completed in about 3 months after approval by the Board. The propsoed Second
Highway Project is a direct development of the First Highway Project, and
proposes to expand the highway rehabilitation program for the Lisbon region to
the country as a whole.
II. THE HIGHWAY SUB-SECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The present Portuguese highway network evolved by the gradual
upgrading of roads which generally were not originally designed either for
modern, heavy, or high-speed motor vehicles. During the last 20 years only
about 1,500 km of newly designed roads have been constructed and the geometric
characteristics and the bearing capacity of the greater part of the network no
longer meet the demands of modern highway traffic. The density of the network



varies from some 60 km per 100 sq. kra in the coastal zone to about 25 km per
100 sq. km in the interior and generally meets quantitative, but not neces-
sarily qualitative, demands.
2.02      Out of a total highway network of just over 32,000 km 1/ some
18,500 km are classified as national highways (Map IBRD 12035R). The remain-
ing 13,500 km are municipal roads. [n addition, there are about 11,000 km of
rural roads and about 4,500 km of forest roads. Except for less than 100 km
of four-lane divided highway, essentially all roads of the national network
are of two-lane standard (Table 2.1).

2.03      Administratively, the national network in continental Portugal 2/ is
subdivided into approximtely 5,650 km of primary (Class I) and about 12,800 km
oi secondary and tertiary (Class II and III) roads. In most cases there is
little difference between the basic physical characteristics of the primary
roads and those of the secondary andl tertiary roads, other things (topography,

region, etc.) being equal. Only about 7% of the national network has a
traveled way of 7 m or more and about 90% of the remainder have a traveled
way between 5 and 6 m. Almost 90% of the national network is asphalt paved,
mostly by surface dressing, about 7% is stone paved and most of the remainder
is old water bound macadam (Table 2.1)
2.04      Due to inadequate pavement structure for present traffic density
and intensity, many of the roads show serious signs of distress even when
given a reasonable amount of routine maintenance. In the Lisbon area, where
about 16% of the national road network is located, some of the road links
have or will be protected and improved by the road rehabilitation program
which the First Highway Project helped to finance. The proposed Second
Highway Project would add to this program and extend it to the country
as a whole (para. 3.01).
B. Traffic
2.05      Country-wide traffic counts, which have been carried out every five
years since 1955, indicate that the highest traffic volumes occur in a 50 km
wide strip along the Atlantic coast between Setubal (about 30 km southeast
of Lisbon) and Viana do Castelo in the north. Within this strip the traffic,
in terms of total vehicle movements, is concentrated around the districts of
Lisbon and Oporto, with a combined total equal to about half of all the
Portugese highway traffic. The district of Lisbon alone accounts for about
30% of the national total highway vehicle movement. The main artery in the
corridor is the Lisbon-Oporto road (the short section of the auto estrada 1/
now constructed and Ni) on which truck traffic makes up somewhat over 20% of
the total average annual daily traffic (AADT).
2.06      On a national basis vehicle traffic, in terms of AADT over various
road links, has grown rapidly during the 1970s. Traffic counts indicate a
growth of some 50% from 1970 through 1975, or over 8% on an annual basis.
This growth is reflected in the growth of the national vehicle fleet. The
1/   A toll expressway.  In 1973 the Government established a program to
build some 346 km of express toll roads from Oporto south through Lisbon
to Setubal. Construction was turned over to a consortium which was to
design and construct the facility and to recover its costs and extract
a profit from tolls. Originally the various sections were to be opened
between 1975 and 1981.  However, only a total of 50 km are now in place,
an 8 km section opened in 1977, a 20 km section south of Lisbon (to
Palmela) opened this year and 22 km (to Vila Franca) north of Lisbon
which was actually constructed by the Government in addition to the
25 April Bridge and its approaches. Two more sections totalling 32 km
in length are now under construction and design work is underway on
additional sections which are scheduled to be constructed within the next
few years. This toll road, until it is turned over to the Government
after an agreed to return to the consortium (probably in 20 or 25 years)
will not be under the jurisdiction of the JAE, but will, of course, be an
important factor in terms of traffic distribution and transport planning.



actual fleet can only be approximated on the basis of registrations and pro-
jected scrappings since vehicles, after their initial registration, are not
re-registered annually. However, on the basis of the figures in Table 2.2,
which are based on registrations, with an adjustment made on the basis of
data on vehicle importation, it is estimated that the vehicle fleet grew
some 93% between 1970 and 1976, or 11.5% annually, and that road freight in
1976 on national roads was 1,800 million ton-km.

2.07      Drivers in Portugal are generally well disciplined, traffic regula-
tions adequate and reasonably well enforced. Regulations include a ten metric
Lon single axle load limit (16 metric ton dual axle) for all highways.
C. Administration
2.08      The national highway system is under the direct administration of
the JAE which is part of the Ministry of Housing and Public Works (MPW). The
JAE is also responsible for the review of the design, and for construction
supervision of the Auto Estradas (para. 1.19), the toll expressway which
is being developed by a consortium under a concession agreement. The main
administrative and technical departments of the JAE are located in Lisbon but,
for the execution of civil works authority has been primarily delegated to
the regional offices and, under the new organizational structure of July 1978,
the design function will also be concentrated in the regions. The districts
have long had direct responsibility for right-of-way acquisition, construction
inspection and maintenance. A chart of the organization of the JAE is shown
on page 10. Local roads, city roads and streets, and forest roads are admin-
istered by local authorities and the forestry department.
2.09      Although the private sector is now paying considerably more than the
public sector for engineers and certain technicians, the loss of JAE staff
during the last two years has been minimal. Recruitment has, however, been
held up due to the fact that the organizational structure was being revised
and, until it was finalized, the Government would not provide funds in the
budget for the new positions. The JAE is now recruiting within the framework
of its new organization structure, and has been getting a reasonable response.

The JAE is presently staffed by about 130 qualified civil engineers as well
as by a few mechanical engineers, landscape architects and geologists.
Technicians, draftsmen, maintenance personnel, administrative personnel and
various other categories bring the total JAE staff to about 3,000. Under
the new organization this number is expected to rise to about 4,000 over the
next several years.
D. Planning
2.10      Within the JAE there is a Cabinet of Planning and Programming which
is responsible for overall planning, for both construction and maintenance.
In 1973 this office, with the assistance of the consultants Dorsch (Federal
Republic of Germany) developed a 10-year highway investment plan which estab-
lished priorities for highway construction and rehabilitation on technical
grounds, taking into consideration general economic criteria. However, the
study did not take into account competing modes, in particular railways and
coastal shipping. This study served. as a basis for the regional (Lisbon
region) maintenance plan which was prepared by the JAE in 1975 for the Bank's
First Highway Project in Portugal. This project provided a technical assist-
ance component which included provision for the development of a Highway
Master Plan in conjunction with a National Transportation Study being under-
taaken under the direction of the MTC. The development of the Highway Master
Plan, which is now under way, will be under the direction of the JAE (para.
1.16).
2.11      The JAE's Office of Planning and Programming which has a high degree
of competence and is staffed by engineers and economists, developed the over-
all indicative highway rehabilitation program on which this project is predi-
cated and will be responsible for the preparation of the individual feasibility
studies required for each section proposed (Annex 1).
E. Financing
2.12      Highway expenditures are normally financed from the general budget
(para 1.19), The present exception is the Auto Estradas (para 2.08). Capital
and recurrent expenditures for the national highway network from 1963 through
1977 are shown in Table 2.3. Although there are a number of direct taxes on
the highway user, such as taxes on fuel, no tax funds are directly earmarked
for highway expenditures. Certain rnotor vehicle taxes are earmarked for the
Land Transportation Fund, but suppoi-t from this Fund has been limited to the
railways (para 1.19), for urban pro;jects and for research and planning.

F. Engineering
2.13      Within the JAE the Directorate of Road Construction is responsible
for the overall technical standards of highway projects although the actual
design has recently been delegated to the regional offices (para. 2.08).
Although the basic design of much of the existing network is obsolescent in
terms of present traffic, this reflects the age of the original construction
and lack of subsequent improvement rather than poor (original) design standards.
New construction is generally being built to satifactory design standards.
2.14       The JAE utilizes the National Civil Engineering Laboratory, which
is administered by the MPW, in the preparation of certain facets of highway
projects, primarily in evaluation of pavement structure and bridge structures.
The Civil Engineering Laboratory is an extremely sophisticated facility,
staffed with competent personnel, which undertakes a wide variety of studies
in the civil engineering field. The Laboratory has made all the analyses of
existing pavement structures and required overlays for the rehabilitation
program under the First Highway Project and will be called upon to provide
most of the analyses under the proposed Second Highway Project. The
Laboratory has the capacity to do the pavement evaluation for the proposed
project.
2.15       The JAE also utilizes the services of local consulting firms for
engineering studies and design to even out the workload, and is utilizing



- 13 -
international consulting firms for technical assistance in Highway Planning,
Administration and Maintenance under the First Highway Project. The JAE
proposes to use consultants for design purposes under the proposed Second
Highway Project to assure expeditious implementation of the proposed
rehabilitation program and this has been included as an element of the
proposed project (para. 3.10).
2.16      Generally, there is no shortage of the required technical staff in
Portugal for highway design, construction and construction supervision and the
basic technical competence exists for highway planning, although there is some
shortage of experienced staff in this area. The return of engineers and tech-
nicians from the former colonies added to the pool of expertise in the country,
and although many Portuguese continue to work abroad, principally in Europe,
this has not been a significant drain on the country's engineering staff.
Overseas work has evidently drawn primarily on the general labor force,
including skilled labor and craftsmen rather than on technicians and pro-
fessional staff.
G. Construction
2.17      Highway construction, reconstruction and rehabilitation projects are
normally awarded after competitive bidding. The local construction industry,
which is well equipped and capable of executing medium-sized highway projects,
was expected to have no problems in providing adequate competence and competi-
tion for the rehabilitation projects under the First Highway Project. This
expectation proved basically correct. However, in the last few years the
labor laws, which make it difficult to lay off employees, even when a par-
ticular job has been completed, have presented a serious problem to civil
engineering contractors. A substantial number of contractors failed during
those years because they were unable to carry excess staff in slack periods.
Others, to survive, have been force to move slowly and operate inefficiently
by keeping their staff at the lowest level possible, even when this meant
long delays in completing a particular aspect of a project. This has been
a problem for the JAE in implementing the First Highway Project. Recent
modification in the labor laws are, however, expected to alleviate this
problem.
2.18      Supervision of construction, including rehabilitation, is normally
carried out by the JAE's own staff, assisted by the National Civil Engineering
Laboratory as required.
H. Highway Maintenance
,.
2.19      Until five years ago highway maintenance was directly carried out
by 18 districts which were supervised by the Directorate of Maintenance at
headquarters in Lisbon. Much of the work was labor intensive, being performed
manually by small working groups responsible for individual road sections of
about 30 km in length. While this method was satisfactory for light traffic
loads, the general increase in traffic, both in terms of vehicle trips and in
heavier vehicles, resulted in a gradual deterioration of overall condition of
the highway network.



- 14 -
2.20      Recognizing the problem, the JAE, in the beginning of 1973, moved to
reorganize and improve the maintenance effort. For this purpose the country
was divided into four regions which were further subdivided into three to five
maintenance districts. Although it would have been, at least theoretically,
possible to increase the maintenance effort by the use of more manpower and
hand tools, the JAE recognized that this was not really possible with the
higher traffic volumes and increased speeds occurring on more and more links.
The amount of manpower required, even if it could be effectively controlled
and coordinated would, under these conditions, in itself result in a lowering
of traffic serviceability.  Physical limitations in the concentration of
manpower would necessitate a spreading out of the work force and maintenance
at any one point would, therefore, require more time. Consequently, to the
extent that the maintenance effort interrupted or slowed traffic, service
would be reduced, and on links with substantial traffic, reduced drastically.
Consequently, the JAE planned that in each district routine maintenance
would be undertaken by self-contained mechanized units which would each be
responsible for about 200 km of roads. Workshop facilities were to be pro-
vided in the various district headquarters and special mechanical services at
regional headquarters.
2.21      Although this organizational structure was established fairly
expeditiously the introduction of mechanized maintenance has been hampered
by lack of both field and shop equipment. To assist in a planned five-
year (1978-81) pilot routine maintenance and periodic (rehabilitation) program
for the Lisbon region, the First Highway Project in Portugal (Loan 1334-PO)
financed a three-year (1978-80) time slice of the rehabilitation program,
equipment for the routine maintenance program and a technical assistance
component. The latter included consultants services to develop a national
five-year highway maintenance program (now expected to be completed early in
1981) and provide maintenance operation and training assistance (para. 1.20).
The pilot maintenance program under the First Highway Project is proceeding
satisfactorily. Further reinforcement of the program will be needed to update
routine highway maintenance throughout Portugal.
I. Training
2.22      Within the framework of the Lisbon pilot maintenance program the
JAE established a program to train a number (about 40) equipment operators by
members of its own staff. However, the shift to mechanized maintenance on a
national level will undoubtedly require a significantly greater, and broader,
training effort. The First Highway Project addresses itself to this require-
ment by providing that the Maintenance Technical Assistance Consultant assist
the JAE in assessing the training necessary to provide the skills for the
projected maintenance program and make recommendations for the development
of formal training programs. These assessments and recommendations are
expected during 1981, and the Second Highway Project provides assistance for
the first two years of this training program.
2.23      The JAE has provided a number of its staff with formal training by
financing their participation in various engineering and planning courses
in the past and, at the request of the Government, the First Highway Project



- 15 -
provides for approximately three man-years of training in traffic engineering
atnd transportation planning for JAE staff members. Fellowships under the
F'irst Highway Project are proceeding satisfactorily, and with the reorganiza-
tion and expansion following the decentralization of the JAE in 1978, the
fellowship program is being extended. The Second Highway Project assists with
this extension.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The proposed project has two objectives, first to extend the pilot
highway rehabilitation program initiated under the First Highway Project to
Portugal as a whole, and second, to assist the JAE with its training require-
ments. A significant number of highways have deteriorated to the point where
ithey need reconditioning to make it possible to maintain them with a reasonable
amount of maintenance effort.  Many of the roads are now in such poor struc-
tural condition that even with intensive and expensive maintenance they will
lbreak up under present traffic loads unless rehabilitation is expeditiously
,zarried out. Thus, the objective of the proposed Second Highway Project is
not only to lower present transport costs throughout Portugal, but to lower
imaintenance costs and to protect past investments in highway infrastructure.
The project has been timed so as to serve as an appropriate extension of the
highway rehabilitation and fellowship programs being financed under the First
Highway Project, and to assist with the first two years of the technical train-
ing program being prepared under the First Highway Project (para. 1.20).
B. Description
3.02      The project would consist of:
(a) a three-year (1980-82) time slice of the highway rehabili-
tation program for national roads (about 1,000 km) and related
supervision,
(b) engineering for these rehabilitation works,
(c) the first two years (1982-83) of a training program for JAE
technical staff, and
(d) post-graduate fellowships abroad for JAE staff.
Highway Rehabilitation
3.03      The JAE has prepared an updated program of high priority rehabili-
tation projects for the national highway network. These individual projects,
totalling about 1,500 km of highway to be rehabilitated over a five-year



- 16-
period, 1980-84, include projects which are considered to have the highest
priority in terms of present conditions and expected traffic levels. 1/
3.04      Roads will be rehabilitated by strengthening and improving the
riding surface of the pavement and by reinstating the shoulders, embankmenL
slopes and drainage systems. In some cases, due to obsolecent design, in
terms of modern traffic (para. 2.13); additional works of pavement and
shoulder widening may be necessary to provide an adequate level of service.
These improvements will, however, be evaluated on their economic merits
individually (Annex 1). Rehabilitation will be carried out by contract.
3.05      Under the proposed project the Bank will finance the foreign cost
of rehabilitation of about 1,000 km of roads throughout Portugal for a
three-year (1980-82) time slice of the Government's five-year (1980-84)
program (Table 3.1 and Map IBRD 12035R). The preliminary scope of the
rehabilitation was established on the basis of the present condition and
traffic on the roads selected, as well as data developed with the implemen-
tation of the rehabilitation component of the First Highway Project on unit
quantities and costs. A technical and economic feasibility study for each
individual section will, however, be submitted to the Bank for approval.
The technical and economic criteria for these studies and their method of
presentation (Annex 1) have been agreed between the Borrower and the Bank,
as reflected in Article II of the Loan Agreement.
3.06      The ultimate scope and priorities of the rehabilitation program
will depend primarily on the residual strength and riding surface of the
road pavements vis-a-vis traffic levels on the road. The National Civil
Engineering Laboratory has developed, with the JAE, a methodology based on
pavement deflection and bumpiness measurements, on soils laboratory tests
and on present and projected traffic loads, to determine the scope of
rehabilitation. The methodology has proven satisfactory in the implemen-
tation of the rehabilitation component of the First Highway Project.
3.07      Although it is expected that modifications to the indicative
rehabilitation program will be made on the basis of specific technical
and economic investigations as the proposed project advances, the JAE
has demonstrated its ability to develop a satisfactory program based
on similar detailed studies during the implement of the rehabilitation
program financed under the First Highway Project.
Training and Fellowships

its operations, the professional and technical staff requirements of the JAE

section will be justified separately as it is designed (paras. 3.05
through 3.07).

b,ave increased.  Over the next several years the JAE expects to increase
its staff from about 3,000 to 4,000 persons, and therefore requires training
programs both for technical staff and for professionals.  The First Highway
project provided for 36 man-months of fellowships abroad, and the proposed
project expands on this program in view of the JAE reorganization by providing
20 fellowships for one year each (Up to 240 man-months) for post graduate
studies abroad in highway and traffic engineering subjects. The Bank loan
will finance the foreign costs of these fellowships.

3.09      For technical staff, the Consultants to the JAE under the First
Highway Project are preparing details by early 1981 for a training program
particularly needed for surveyors, works inspectors and materials techni-
cians. Under the proposed project the Bank will finance the foreign costs of
the first two years of this training program, expected to be 1982-83. These
foreign costs are expected to be largely comprised of audio-visual and other
training equipment, but also may cover the foreign costs of instructors
if required.  The Government has agreed to submit by July 1, 1981, its pro-
posals on the training program for Bank agreement though parts of the program
may start before then, in particular the purchase of some of the training
equipment subject to prior Bank agreement.
Engineering Services
3.10      Consultancy services under the project would be provided for the
design of the rehabilitation works to assure expeditious implementation of
the program. Consultants will be employed under Terms of Reference and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. It is estimated that 160 man-months of
consultants services will be required, with the JAE providing the rest of
the engineering services through its own staff and through the National
Laboratory.
3.11      The proposed road rehabilitation program will lead to peaking in the
JAE engineering design load. To ensure a smooth and early implementation of
the program, while avoiding the necessity to staff-up to meet this "peak load",
which would be inefficient both in terms of long-run staff continuity and in
terms of time, the JAE intends to employ the National Laboratory to carry out
pavement evaluation and to employ consultants to prepare detailed design and
bid documents. The National Laboratory is satisfactorily carrying out similar
pavement evaluation work on the rehabilitation component of the First Highway
Project and has the capacity to do the pavement evaluation for the proposed
Second Highway Project.
3.12      The JAE wishes to encourage the local consulting industry in the
expanding field of highway work, and there are an adequate number of competent
local firms to ensure competition and to carry out the work. Because the
individual projects are small and spread throughout Portugal, foreign design
firms may not be interested or competitive. However, the JAE has indicated
its intention to include appropriate foreign firms on the short list, such as
those already doing work in Portugal.
3.13      To the extent that staff contraints allow the JAE may also parti-
cipate in the detailed design work, but their contribution in this area may
not be significant.
C. Cost Estimate

ment during negotiations is as follows:

8% in 1981 and 7% in both 1982 and 1983. This reflects a somewhat lower
overall foreign price escalation plus the expected relation of the US
dollar to other major foreign currencies and a much higher local escala-
tion.  However, although local escalation in escudos is expected to be
about 20 to 24% in 1979 and 1980 and only somewhat less than that in the
next two years, the higher rate will be reduced to an equivalent rate in
terms of US$ by changes in the exchange rate, given the policy of exchange
rate adjustments. By the same token, the escalation of price in terms of
escudos for both local and foreign costs has been calculated at the pro-
jected local escalation rate to accommodate concurrent changes in the
exchange rate. In this estimate a rate of 22% is used for 1979, 20% for
1980, 17% for 1981, 15% for 1982 and 13% for 1983.
7/   Total project cost in escudos cannot be converted directly into project
costs in dollars at 45:1 because different price escalation rates reflect-
ing expected changes in exchange rates are used.  See footnote /6 above.

3.15      The cost estimate for the road rehabilitation component of the
project reflects preliminary quantities for pavement resurfacing and rein-
stating shoulders, embankments and drainage systems for 1,000 km at unit rates
applicable in August 1978. Final quantities and, consequently, final cost,
will depend on the detailed investigations to be made for each section (para.
3.05). Depending on the final costs the total length of rehabilitated roads
may, therefore, differ from the 1,000 km presently estimated to be financed
under the project.
3.16      Cost estimates for engineering reflect the cost of pavement evalu-
ation work to be carried out by the National Laboratory at an average of
Escudos 22,000 per km and consultant design services in accordance with
Government practice which, at price levels of August 1978, are expected
to average about US$5,000 equivalent per man-month, including travel, per
diem and reports (equivalent to $6,875 at estimated actual costs including
price escalation). This rate reflects an estimated mix of 75% local and 25%
international consultants, with local consultants costs estimated at (US$4,000
equivalent per man-month and foreign consultants costs at US$8,000 equivalent
per man-month.
3.17       Cost estimates for fellowships are based on current costs in Europe
and North America for these courses, and the cost estimates of the training
program for technicians cover audio-visual, other training equipment,
instructors, classrooms and related expenses.
3.18      A 10% quantity contingency for road rehabilitation covers possible
adjustments in the estimated thickness of asphalt overlays and the reinstate-
ment of shoulders, embankments and drainage systems. A 10% quantity contin-
gency in engineering covers possible changes in design requirements to reflect
both changes in possible in-house design work by JAE and changes in total
design requirements. Price escalation is based both on projected price in-
creases and on relative exchange relationships between the escudo and the
dollar. To develop costs which represent the actual amounts of expenditures,
both local and foreign, a projection was made of possible price escalations
in terms of escudos and in terms of dollars. Because of exchange rate
adjustments local costs, when expressed in dollars will not show the same
"escalation" as when expressed in escudos. Conversely, the possible exchange
implications have to be considered when expressing foreign costs in escudos.
On balance it was considered that price escalation alone, in terms of constant
escudos (or dollars) would be the same for both local and foreign costs since
Portugal is essentially subject to the same basic economic forces (and price
escalation) as Europe as a whole. However, because of various economic
realities, the escudo is expected to depreciate in terms of the dollar over
the next few years. Consequently, an additional "escalation" must be con-
sidered in terms of escudos. Therefore, escalation reflects expected local
escalation when expressed in local currency and foreign (dollar) price es-
calation when expressed in dollars. Comparison of the values will show pro-
jected exchange rates. The appraisal mission estimated local price escala-
tion at 22% in 1979, 20% in 1980, 17% in 1981, 15% in 1982 and 13% in 1983
and the Government concurred with these estimates.



- 21 -
3.19      The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$39.3 million
which represents some 34% of the total estimated project cost of US$114.7
million. It is assumed that the majority of contracts for the rehabilitation
works will be won by local contracting firms on the basis of our experience
with the rehabilitation component of the First Highway Project. In that case,
the local contracting industry has proved to be competitive while foreign
contractors were not interested in the relatively minor individual paving
contracts.
D. Financing
3.20      The proposed loan of US$40.0 million, represents the estimated for-
eign costs of road rehabilitation (US$38.4 million), 80% of the total costs
oE engineering consultancies (US$1.0 million) net of Portuguese taxes, and
the foreign costs of the fellowships and training program (US$0.6 million).
ALthough a major portion of the engineering services may be won by local con-
sultants (para 3.12), the Bank would finance local consulting costs to the
same extent (80%) as would occur if foreign consultants were employed so as
not to discriminate against the local consulting industry. The Government
will finance the remaining local costs of the project estimated as Esc. 4.21
billion (US$74.7 million equivalent) of which approximately Esc. 835 million
(IJS$14.8 million equivalent) represents Portuguese taxes.
E. Implementation
Responsibility for Implementation and Supervision
3.21      The JAE will have the overall responsibility for the design, execu-
tion and supervision of the rehabilitation projects, including the consulting
and National Laboratory services for design. The supervision of the rehabilita-
tion works will be carried out by JAE staff in the appropriate District Office
under the general guidance of the Directorates of Road Maintenance and Con-
struction. This is the same arrangement which has worked effectively for the
rehabilitation component of the First Highway Project. The JAE will also be
responsible for the fellowships and the training program for technical staff.
Procurement
3.22      Contracts for the road rehabilitation works will be based on unit
prices and generally will be awarded after competitive bidding in accordance
with local procedures.  These procedures require that invitations to bid be
advertised in the local press and allow foreign contractors to bid although
no special notification is made to the local representation of any foreign
country.  Because it is unlikely that foreign contractors will be interested
in the relatively minor individual paving contracts (para 3.18) and taking
into consideration that the work will be spread over about 40 contracts on
approximately 100 road sections all over Portugal during a three-year (1980-
82) period, this procedure is satisfactory. The presence of over a dozen
local paving contractors, and our experience under the First Highway Project,
indicates that there will be adequate competition under local procedures.
Flowever, a number of appropriate sections will be packaged so that the unit



- 22 -
will be large enough (total estimated construction cost of at least US$2.5
million each, and with a global total estimated at about US$10 million)
to attract foreign contractors. Since contractors will be able to bid on
individual sections as well as the whole unit such packaging would not exclude
smaller, local, contractors from bidding. These packages will be awarded on
the basis of ICB. These procedures were agreed between the Borrower and the
Bank during negotiations.
3.23      That engineering design which JAE decides it will not do itself or
through the National Laboratory, will be carried out by consultants and
according to conditions and Terms of Reference, all satisfactory to the Bank.
3.24      Procurement of equipment for training (total estimated at $250,000)
will be done through local competitive procedures which are satisfactory,
except for contracts of more than $50,000 each will be procured after inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for
Procurement," and contracts for less than $10,000 each (which in aggregate
are no more than $100,000) may be procured by local shopping.
Project Implementation Schedule
3.25      The rehabilitation works will be spread over a period of three
years beginning in early 1980. Engineering started in earlyk7 1979. The
training program is expected to begin in early 1982 and most of the
expenditures under this project for training equipment are likely to
take place before that and in accordance with the program of work the
JAE expects to submit to the Bank by July 1, 1981. The fellowships
program will be spread over three to four years commencing with the
academic year September/October 1979. These details of implementa-
tion and the implementation schedule have been agreed between the
Borrower and the Bank (Table 3.3).
3.26      Procedures for proposing to the Bank annual works programs for the
three-year rehabilitation program and for feasibility studies and bid evalua-
tions, have been agreed between the Borrower and the Bank, as also have
quarterly progress reporting procedures on the Project as a whole. Details of
these procedures are incorporated in a Side Letter to the Loan Agreement.
F. Disbursements
3.27      The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be disbursed on the
following basis:
(i) 35% of the cost of the rehabilitation works, representing
the estimated foreign exchange cost;
(ii)  80% of the cost of the consulting services;

IV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01       The proposed road rehabilitation program would reduce transport
costs throughout mainland Portugal where a significant number of highways
have deteriorated to the point where they need reconditioning to make it
possible to maintain them with a "normal" (regular) amount of maintenance
effort.  Even with intensive and expensive maintenance, some of the roads
are now in such poor condition that they will break up under the present
traffic load unless rehabilitation is expeditiously carried out. Benefits
from such rehabilitation will include not only savings in transport costs,
but also savings in maintenance costs and, in a number of cases, savings in
reconstruction costs.
4.02       The benefits from the road rehabilitation program will accrue to
the economy of Portugal as a whole. In terms of traffic demand the program
represents a least (economic) cost investment to meet that demand and is
economically sound and rational. Benefits in the form of reduced maintenance
and reconstruction costs will accrue directly to the state; this also applies,
to a significant extent, to transport cost savings. The state directly owns
about 1 percent of the trucking fleet and has also, through nationalization of
the banks and some industries, indirectly acquired control of a more signifi-
cant portion of the industry. Part of the transport savings would go to
private companies and individuals who own the remainder of the trucking fleet
and to owners and users of passenger cars. The extent to which benefits to
truckers will be "passed down" depends on continued competition in the industry,
which is now quite strong, and Government taxing and pricing policies (para
1.18). The benefits to passenger vehicles cover essentially the whole spec-
trum of income groups, including riders of public transport, employer-owned
and private cars, reflecting the diversity of traffic using the highways.
Public or private, however, the passenger car user, with fuel prices among
the highest in Western Europe (Table 4.1) and other taxes and charges, evi-
dently more than pays his way (para 4.03).
4.03       Between 1970 and 1975, total direct taxes on the highway user (i.e.,
excluding import duties on vehicles and spare parts) totaled almost 32 billion
escudos. During the same five-year period road maintenance and construction
expenditures on all non-urban national, municipal and forest roads totaled
less than 7 billion escudos. Fuel taxes accounted for some 54% of the total
direct user charges and gasoline taxes on private cars represented about
75% of this. l'/ Further, of the remaining 25%, almost all was collected
from private diesel fueled cars.
1/   In 1977, the last year for which information is presently available,
taxes on the sale of automobiles alone amounted to over 154% of all
national taxes on gasoline.

4.04       In 1977, total revenue from taxes and charges on road transport was
approximately Escudos 11 billion while total expenditures on national roads
was approximately Escudos 2.7 billion and on local roads 0.5 billion (3.3
billion overall). Therefore, it is apparent that highway users as a whole pay
their way and that there is no hidden subsidy to highway transport per se.
However, there may well be some cross-subsidization within road transport
between different user groups and/or vehicle types. This question will be
reviewed by the National Transport Planning consultants in terms of transport
policy generally and by the Highway Planning Consultants specifically in their
evaluation of user charges. Both these consultant studies are being financed
as part of the First Highway Project (para 1.20).
B. Economic Evaluation
4.05      The road sections to be included in the road rehabilitation program
under this proposed project have been tentatively identified (Table 3.1).
Before any section is finally accepted under the project, it will be sub-
jected to detailed study under a methodology already agreed with the JAE
during negotiations (para 3.05). Each individual road section accepted for
rehabilitation will be required to have an ER of at least 12% under this
analysis. This is considered to be a conservative estimate of the opportunity
cost of capital in Portugal. Our experience in the First Highway Project



-- 27 -
indicates that most sections will have an ER considerably above the 12%
minimum even on the conservative basis of ignoring possible traffic growth and
savings in regular (routine) maintenance with the thirteen links so far analyzed
showing ERs between 12 and 75 percent.  This is not unexpected, given the fact
that the links proposed for rehabilitation are of high priority, with rela-
tively high present vehicle operating costs due to poor surface condition and
that an investment in rehabilitation is considerably less costly than building,
or rebuilding, an equivalent road facility.
C.   Project Risk
4.06      There are no significant project related risks.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal issues:
(a)  for the road rehabilitation program, the JAE will submit the
technical and economic feasibility of rehabilitating each
individual road section for the Bank's approval before the
start of each rehabilitation (para 3.05);
(b) the JAE will submit a training program to the Bank by July 1,
1981, and will implement a program of training and fellowships
in agreement with the Bank (paras 3.08 and 3.09); and
(c) the JAE will provide engineering services for design and
supervision of the road rehabilitation program, through
an adequate number of its own qualified staff, and to the
extent necessary, througlh the National Laboratory and
consultants (paras 3.11, 3.13 and 3.21).
5.02      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$40 million equivalent
to the Republic of Portugal for a 15-year term including a three-year grace
period.

ANNEX 1
PORTUGAL
APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
Feasibility Studies for Individual
Road Rehabilitation Sections
A. Introduction
1.01      In order to establish the economic viability for proposed rehabili-
tation of individual road sections, a short feasibility study will be prepared.
This study will serve as a basic technical and economic document to be sub-
mitted to the Bank in support of the proposed rehabilitation of the individual
road sections. This annex details the basic requirements for such feasibility
studies and the methodology for making the economic evaluation.
B. Basic Inputs for Feasibility Studies
1.02      The studies shall include enough basic data to enable the Bank to
make a meaningful review, including a duplication of the calculations. This
should include a brief description on the project giving the basic physical
elements, including length, existing pavement and shoulder width, present con-
dition of roadway and proposed works. The proposed rehabilitations shall be
detailed to the extent that they identify overlay elements, including average
thickness proposed, unit costs, total costs and any improvement elements
(such as widening, etc.) with unit and total costs. Summary basic data on
pavement deflection measurements bumpiness soils tests and other information
needed to make the analysis meaningful should be attached as an annex. The
data may be in tabular or graphic form.
1.03      In addition, the report should include present traffic data, by
vehicle type, axle load data and support for any traffic projections and axle
load trends which are used in the analysis (para 1.18). Data on basic user
costs which will be used in the analysis need only be presented for Bank
review with the first study, or independently before the first study, and
thereafter only if adjustments are necessary. The user cost data should show
how (on what basis) it was developed and should be presented in a complete
document which can be effectively reviewed without reference to other data
or publications. It is considered that savings in leisure time have no value
to the economy per se and such values should not be used as benefits.



ANNEX I

C. Economic Evaluation
1.04      There are essentially two steps in determining the economic viability
oE a highway, or any other investment. First, the least (economic) cost alter-
native must be determined. Next, the economic justification of the alternative
must be analyzed. 1/
(a) Alternatives
1.05      For the purpose of evaluating the proposed road rehabilitation proj-
ects for Bank financing, it will be necessary to determine what are the real 2/
alternatives. One of course is the "do nothing" 3/ solution. Another might
be to increase regular maintenance effort (patching, etc.). A third could be
to construct a new road.  All that are "reasonable" or "reasonably possible"
solutions should be considered unless certain simplifying assumptions are
warranted (para 1.13).  Not all need be evaluated in detail.  For example, it
might be "reasonably possible" to construct a new road but it may be obvious
that this solution would involve the utilization of significantly greater
amounts of economic resources (i.e., have a greater total economic cost) than
an overlay even after a cursory examination. Under such circumstances this
alternative would not be considered further. Care should also be taken not
t:o overlook improvements which are incrementally justified over and above
basic rehabilitation and can be reasonably accommodated with the rehabilita-
i:ion of the roadway.
1.06      The "do nothing" solution must always be considered, even if it is
obvious that it will not be the least cost solution since this condition is
the base against which the economic justification of the selected course of
action will be measured. The possibility of increasing the regular main-
tenance effort (rather than providing for an overlay) should also be one of
1/   In the analysis of certain projects, such as a highway maintenance proj-
ect, where all alternatives are considered, including doing nothing at
all (in the case of a maintenance project, no maintenance at all) then
the least cost solution will obviously be justified. However, in con-
sidering whether to build a new highway link the least cost new link
(in terms of geometrics, alignment, etc. considering construction,
maintenance and user costs) is first ascertained and then evaluated for
economic justification. For the rehabilitation program considered here,
since the "do nothing" condition actually represents doing something
(see footnote 3) same general procedure is followed. (This also pro-
vides a basis for ranking the proposed investments and/or comparing
them with other types of investments).
2/   "Real" in the sense of practical, authentic, sensible solutions.
3/   i.e., do nothing more than now is being done (in maintenance effort,
etc.).



- 30 -                      ANNEX 1
the alternatives "costed" out where the rehabilitation alternative only in-
volves the necessity of resurfacing. However, where pavement strengthening
is a physical requirement if the roadway is to remain serviceable, increased
routine (regular) maintenance would not ordinarily be a "real" (practical,
sensible) alternative. If this is the case it should be noted in the feas-
ibility study and substantiated.
(b) Economic Costs
1.07      After the possible alternatives have been established their (eco-
nomic) costs have to be compared to arrive at the least cost alternative.
These costs fall into three categories. The first is the direct investment
(design, construction, supervision, etc.) cost, the second the maintenance
cost and the third, user costs (i.e., direct costs to the users of the road
section being considered). The preferred alternative must be the least total
cost alternative.
1.08      Unfortunately (for the analyst), costs over the particular link
being studied may not be directly comparable. This is because, in comparing
the alternatives, we are not necessarily comparing the same traffic. Thus,
the "do nothing" alternative will probably involve, as road conditions further
deteriorate, some traffic diverting to other roads, or, conceivably, disap-
pearing as costs rise above various transport demand cost thresholds, while
the "rehabilitation" alternative may involve traffic being diverted to the
improved link and possibly even some generated traffic. So, in a real sense,
the total cost picture must be examined in terms of the network including the
costs to traffic and links (maintenance cost increases or decreases) which
traffic is diverted to and from.
(c) Economic Benefits
1.09      However, leaving aside the particular problem of cost comparabil-
ity for a moment, once the least cost alternative is determined on the basis
of "least total cost", (construction, maintenance and user costs) in terms
of present worth based on the opportunity cost of capital 1/, then the second
step is to evaluate the benefits which can be expected to accrue from the
planned investment.
1.10      As a practical matter benefits are generally measured, for this
type of improvement, as user costs savings plus any differences in maintenance
1/   The "present" may be moved to any date in the computation.  The import-
ant thing is that costs (and benefits), or, more properly, the cost
and benefit stream, be compared on the basis of a "present" sum estab-
lished by use of the opportunity cost of capital (e.g., the "real"
interest rate). For this analysis an opportunity cost of capital of
12% is probably about the right order of magnitude and should be used
at the present time.



- 31 -                      ANNEX I
costs 1/. The question is, what alternative (to the proposed improvement)
should be considered in the analyses. It appears logical to consider costs
to the user (plus differences in maintenance costs) with the road "rehabili-
tated" and costs that would occur under "normal" 2/ maintenance but without
rehabilitation. But one must-be careful here, for it is not logical to
assume that, as the road deteriorates (or perhaps, disintegrates) that the
same amount of traffic will continue to use it. What is more probable is
that traffic will divert over time to other roads and/or modes where costs
may be higher than present cost but less than future costs on the link being
studied. Even if there are no practical alternatives a point may well be
reached where traffic will decrease as costs become too high to justify the
particular traffic movement.
(d) Other Improvements
1.11      In those cases where significant improvements such as pavement,
shoulder and bridge widening are proposed for inclusion with the basic rehab-
ilitation, the improvement must also be subject to the test of economic
justification incrementally over and above the basic rehabilitation 3/.
Thus, it will be necessary to establish the least cost alternative without
the improvement, and then to analyze the improvement as an "addition" to
this "least cost solution". To do this, it is only necessary to compare
the additional costs the improvement will engender with the additional bene-
fits it will develop. If the (economic) benefits are greater than the (eco-
nomic) costs the improvement is justified, and should be incorporated in
the project which may then be analyzed as an entity. The analysis of pro-
posed improvements should be treated separately in the feasibility studies.
(e) Simplifying Assumptions
1.12      Obviously then, the analysis is not simple or necessarily limited
to one link. However, it is not always necessary to determine the "exact"
rate of return or B:C ratio. What is critical is to determine if the invest-
ment is the "best" alternative and if it is justified. Since this program is
essentially aimed at providing a pavement overlay for selected, high priority
roads several simplifying assumptions may be made.
1.13      First of all, in considering alternatives, even if the decision to
build a new road were made in the immediate future, the time needed for a
feasibility study, design, land acquisition, and construction makes it highly
unlikely that any new road could be open to traffic before an additional five
1/   These could be positive or negative.
2/   "Normal" in the sense of the maintenance effort increasing as the road
surface deteriorates; see para 1.16.
3/   Ordinarily improvements to drainage may be considered part of the pave-
ment strengthening work and need not be analyzed separately.



-32-                        ANNEX 1
years has passed. More probably the time interval between decision to build
and opening a new road to traffic would be even greater. Since any asphalt
road carrying its designated traffic can be expected to require a pavement
overlay in 6 to 10 years, it is probable that the link to be rehabilitated
would require another pavement overlay by the time a "new" road was ready
for traffic. Therefore, by limiting the analysis to an eight-year period
the alternative of a "new" road need not be considered.
1.14      In line with the continued overall growth in traffic over the high-
ways in Portugal, traffic over a particular link probably would experience
some growth, other things being equal, over the analysis period. However,
as the road condition deteriorated some traffic would shift (divert) to other
links; and, if the link under study were improved some traffic might divert
from other routes (links) to it. A simplifying assumption, probably on the
conservative side as far as establishing benefits goes, would be to use pre-
sent traffic through the period of analysis on all alternatives considered.
If this is done then it only remains to estimate user costs, maintenance costs
and improvement costs under each possible alternative (which will really in-
volve only different levels of maintenance and rehabilitation) to establish
the least cost alternative.
(f) Analysis
1.15      Once the least cost alternative is known, and that alternative
is, in fact, rehabilitation the analysis may be made using the simplifying
assumptions 1/.
1.16      Present traffic may be considered to continue through the whole
eight-year period of analysis, both under improved and "existing" conditions.
However, in the analysis it should not be assumed that the "existing" sur-
face will deteriorate at a rate consistent with that traffic and maintenance
effort. Rather, the least cost path (solution) between increasing regular
maintenance and increasing user costs should be considered. In a practical
sense this would probably mean that both user costs and maintenance costs
(patching, etc.) will go up but overall the total will be less than the user
cost increase alone which could be expected at present rates of maintenance.
1.17      Once benefits have been calculated the Economic Return (Internal
Rate of Return) should be developed. For the purposes of this project an
Economic Return (ER) of 12% or more is considered acceptable. Since the above
simplication ignores possible traffic (i.e., benefits) growth over the period
1/   If the alternative considered includes a significant improvement this
must first be analyzed separately before the general analysis is made
(see para 1.11).

of analysis it is obvious that the First Year Benefit (FYB) 1/ will be some-
what higher than the ER and it need not be calculated.
1.18      In using the above methodology, with its simplifying assumptions,
care must be eaken not to apply it to links where special conditions make
it inappropriate. For example, in a situation where a new road is expected
to result in the diversion of traffic from the link being considered during
the period of analysis a traffic projection must take this into account in
establishing the least cost alternative and the ER of that alternative.
Further, since the simplifying assumption of no traffic growth may severely
understate benefits, it may be desirable, for those links which show an ER
close to, but somewhat below, the 12% "cut off" under the simplified analysis
to consider possible traffic growth and re-evaluate these links. However,
when projections showing a traffic increase are made the feasibility study
should support the reasonableness of such projections, and the timing of the
investments by a FYB analysis.
1.19      For the most part, however, it is expected that the simplified
methodology described will provide a fairly accurate, if somewhat conserva-
tive, evaluation of the economic justification of rehabilitation for the
links to be considered.
1/   The FYB compares benefits in the first year (of operation) to the pre-
sent worth (in that year) of investment costs (which, here, will be
essentially the cost of rehabilitation since maintenance cost differ-
ences are considered in the benefit streams. (See para 1.10).
