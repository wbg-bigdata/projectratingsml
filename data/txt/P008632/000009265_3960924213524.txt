SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1700-PO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Highway
Project in Portugal, for which Loan 1700-PO in the amount of US$40.0
million was approved on May 17, 1979. The loan was closed on
March 31, 1987 about 2-3/4 years after the initial closing date of
June 30, 1984. It was fully disbursed and the last disbursement was on
March 26, 1987.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Country Department 4
Infratructure Division of the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Region
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final
supervision mission of the project in October 1988, aud is based, itnter
alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan Agreement; supervision
reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; intterviews with
Bank and Borrower staff responsible for the implementation of the project;
and internal Bank memoranda.

SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1700-PO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Introduction and Background
L.       The socio-economic setting against which the project was
identified and prepared is discussed in paras. 3-13 of the May 7, 1979
President's Report (PR). Paras. 2.01 - 2.22 of the April 30, 1979 Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR) described the status and prospects of the highway
subsector in the late 1970s. The salient feature was that, when the Second
Highway Project was being prepared, many highways had deteriorated to the
point where they needed extensive reconditioning to make it possible to
maintain them.
2.       The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) on the First Highway
Project (OED Report No. 6590 of January 15, 1987) shows that at the time of
appraisal of the Second Highway Project (August - September 1978),
implementation of the First Highway Project (Credit 1334-PO of 1976) 
aimed at highway rehabilitation and maintenance, some road construction,
and the creation of a framework for transportation investments -- was
experiencing significant delays. The Borrower and the Bank were unfamiliar
with one another's procedures; the Borrower was encountering severe
financial problems; and the still unsettled political situation led to
staff and labor shortages. Nevertheless, both the PR (para. ;8) and the
SAR (para. 4.06) of the Second Highway Project stated that there were no
significant project related risks.
Obiectives
3.       Intended:  Extend the pilot rehabilitation program initiated under
the First Highway Project to Portugal as a whole. Strengthen staff
training by assisting with the first two years of the technical training
program prepared under the First Highway Project. (PR, para. 44; SAR,
paras. 3.01 and 1.20).
Achieved: Road rehabilitation exceeded the targets set at appraisal but
over a period that was more than two years longer than expected (PCR,
para. 12). The staff training program was radically modified during
implementation (PCR, para. 12; PCR, Statistical Information, D. Project
Implementation).

Implementation Experience
4.       Experience witth the implementation of the different components was
as follows:
(a) A three-year (1980-82) time slice of the highway
rehabilitation program ior national roads (about 1,000 km)
and related supervision.  Implementation took two years more
than expected (PCR, para. 12), but physical output (1,540 km)
was greater than planned, primarily because of the
appreciation of the US$ (PCR, para. 12).
(b) Engineering for rehabilitation works under (a). Actual
expenditures (US$543,600) were far below the appraisal
estimate of US$2.0 million (PCR, paras. 8 and 10, Statistical
Information, Project Costs) because of the significant
participation of JAE staff in the preparation of the
engineering designs. Supervision of works was satisfactorily
carried out by JAE staff (PCR, para. 10).
(c) The first two years (1982-83) of a training program for JAE
technical staff. This component was modified (PCR, para. 22)
to respond to changed circumstances and proved satisfactory.
(d) Post-graduate fellowships abroad for JAE staff. This
component was also satisfactorily modified in accordance with
JAE requirements (PCR, para. 22).
Results
5.       Actual completion time was extended to December 31, 1986 from
December 31, 1983. Appraisal required that road segments to be
rehabilitated ought to show a minimum estimated EER of 12%. Re-estimated
EERs for completed works are, on the whole, substantialy above this minimum
level (PCR, para. 14 and Tables 3 - 4). The project contributed
substantially to the institutional strengthening of JAE (PCR, paras. 16 and
42).
Sustainability
6.       Despite continuing difficulties with local cost financing (PCR,
para. 7), the project's contribution to institutional development in the
highway subsector, especially with regard to regionalization and adoption
of innovative maintenance procedures, seems to be sustainable (PCR, paras.
15 - 17).
Findings and Lessons
7.       The Project allowed the Bank to extend its program of assistance
begun under the First Program and to enlarge the scope of its collaboration
with the Borrower. Relations have been amicable throughout and are being
strengthened further with the implementation of the Third Highway Ptoject.



- iv -
8.       Experience trom the project suggests that the Bank-Borrower
relations could be improvud furthet if differences of opinion were settled
concerning contentious issues such as application of loan covenants (PCR,
para. 21), consistency bf data furmished by the Borrower (PCR, para. 30),
thresholds for international competitive bidding (PCR, para. 37), and the
requirements for advance approval by the Bank for commencement of works, or
for different types of procurement (PCR, paras. 38 - 39).

Subsector               Highways
B. Background
2.       Portugal has a well developed transport network.  Concentrated in
the 50 km wide western coastal plain, traffic mainly runs along the 320 km
corridor between Lisbon and Oporto, the country's two largest cities. The
network is less dense in the south and east where economic activity is less
intense and the terrain more difficult. Nonetheless, as a result of
earlier Government road programs, every village with more than 100
inhabitants is linked to the main road network.  Road and Lu.l fa.iiities,
however, have sufferea from inadequate upgrading and maintetcanct in the
past due to lack of funding, and their standards are considurtaby lower
than those demanded by the type and volume of traffic utili?.ing them.  Sea
and air transport facilities are in general satisfactory. rhe Government,
recognizing these circumstances initiated an overall transport planning
study and separate modal studies for railways and highways under the First
Highway Project (1334-PO; 1976). The aim was to develop rational transport
policies and development plans. These studies were completed by mid-1982
and have been the base of future investments under Highways 3.
3.       Until the late 1970s transport policy and planning were largely
decided on an ad hoc basis, but since 1979 the Gabinete de Estudos e
Planeamento (Studies and Planning Department; GEP), in the Ministry of
Public Works, Transport and Communications (MOPTC), has coordinated long
term transport planning. This has served as the basis for determining
transport policy anti development priorities. Under the GEP umbrella, the
Planning and Programming (GPP) office of the JAE (Junta Autonoma de
Estradas; the Highway Authority), responsible for overall highway
planning-both construction and maintenance-became particularly
efficient. All highway investments are based on detailed three or five



-2-
year plans prepared by GPP and monitored by GEP. The other transport modes
have followed similar approaches. The Government owns tire railways
(Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses; CP), the national airline (Transportes
Aereos Portugueses; TAP), and most of the merchant marine. It has
responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the national highway
system through the JAE and shares responsibility for local and forest roads
through the local governments and, for ports, through the port authorities.
4.       The project was well linked to the transport sector and
macro-economic policy objectives. It contributed, nationwide, to the
rehabilitation and maintenance of roads in danger of obsolescence and
loss. In addition it promoted, through savings in foreign currency and
transport cost, and through better regional accessibility and easier
movement of products, the country's two main macro-economic policy
objectives: the expansion of export oriented manufacturing and of the
agriculture sector.
C. Project Objectives arn Description
5.       The main objective of the project was to extend nationwide the
rehabilitation program, initiated on a pilot basis in the Lisbon region
under the First Highway Project, and in so doing support the Goveriunenc's
policy of decentralization and regional development. Project components
were directed to: (i) easing the backlog in modernization and
rehabilitation works of the road network; (ii) reconstructing inadequate
sections that hindered regional economic development; and (iii) improving
the institutional framework and the qualifications of public works staff to
carry out satisfactory road maintenance.
Specifically, the project consisted of:
(a) a three-year (1980-82) time slice of the highway
rehabilitation program for national roads and related
supervision;
(b) engineering for these rehabilitation works; and
(c) training and fellowships for JAE staff.
6.       The project provided for the rehabilitation of about 1,000 km of
roads throughout Portugal (see map) during the 1980-82 period of the JAE
Five Year Rehabilitation Program (1980-84; 1,500 km) for the national
network. Rehabilitation included strengthening and improving the riding
surface, and reinstatement of shoulders, embankment slopes, retaining walls
and drainage systems, and in most cases additional works of pavement and
shoulder widening to accommodate modern traffic requirements. Engineering
for these rehabilitation works was prepared by JAE assisted by the National
Civil Engineering Laboratory (NCEL; pavement and soil evaluations) and
consultants. The project included a two-year training program for
technical staff (surveyors, works inspectors and materials technicians) and
twenty fellowships abroad for one year each for post-graduates in highway
and traffic engineering. The latter component was designed to assist JAE
under the Plan and its recent (1978) decentralization into four regional



offices with full responsibility for execution of works and maintenance.
Supervision of works would be by the four regional offices under the JAE
Directorate of Road Maintenance.
D. Project Design and Organization
7.       JAE, which manages the main road network at the central level as
an autonomous agency within the MPW, was the only executing agency of the
project.  The project design (para. 6) was clearly justified in view of the
deterioration of the main network. The project did apply the conceptua;
principles of rehabilitation and maintenance developed on a pilot basis
under Highway I on a nationwide scale (para. 5). It did also, for the
first time, execute a project on a decentralized basis, with each regional
office fully responsible for design, construction, and maintenance, the
central JAE (GPP) remaining as planner and coordinator. The importance and
validity of the project was well understood by the Borrower and the Bank,
but its timing overlapped with the delayed Highways I, the recent efforts
of regionalization, and the impending budgetary difficulties which delayed
its implementation. The preparation of the project was satisfactory in the
designs of the works, less so in the technical assistance and training for
the implementation of maintenance management systems. Although the JAE and
the Bank defined well their roles, JAE experienced organizational problems
in the coordination of regional works and in the colleLtioll of data
generated by the project at the regional level. In additiuon, loth failed
to foresee the forthcoming difficulties in the provision uf local funds and
the period of high inflation which were the main causes of pruject
difficulties and delays.
E. Project Implementation
8.       The actual and expected project implementation schedule is shown
in Table 1. The main component of the project, Road Rehabilitation, Look 7
years for implementation compared with 4-1/3 years planned at appraisal.
Project commencement was delayed six months because the National Civil
Engineering Laboratory was not able to deliver on time the pavement and
soil evaluation tests required for engineering of each road section. This
obstacle, not foreseen at appraisal, was overcome through help provided by
consultants but the six month delay was not recovered. A need for better
planning of geotechnical studies in the future, however, is clear. A
further and main cause of delay was chronic shortage of local funds in the
1980-83 budgets. This shortage might have been anticipated on the basis of
the economic situation prevailing in Portugal in 1978/79 and the delays
experienced under the First Highway Project, which was still under
execution. Despite Bank requests to the Minister of Finance to provide the
required local funds for rehabilitation and maintenance according to the
loan agreement, the economic situation impeded the Ministry in complying
with the relevant covenants of the loan agreement until 1984.
9.       By June 1984, the initial loan closing date, only 502 of the
program was completed and the project was two years behind schedule.
Between 1979 and 1984 the devaluation of the Escudo against the US$ by more
than 300% was an additional obstacle as it involved a significant increase
of expenditures in domestic currency. With the economic situation slightly



-'4-
improved over that in 1982/83 and the First Highway Project--a major
consumer of local funds in the transport sector--recently completed, the
Government promised adequate provision of local funds and requested the
Bank to: (i) finance 50% instead of 35% of works costs from
January 1, 1984; and (ii) extend the loan closing date to
December 31, 1985. The Bank response was favorable. It increased
participation to 50% and agreed to establish a revolving fund by
incorporating a Special Account in the Loan Agreement and to permit the use
of statement of expenditures. The loan closing date was extended in two
successive steps to June 30, 1986. These actions were decisive and allowed
satisfactory project implementation.
10.      Supervision of construction -  and most engineering designs --
were carried out directly by JAE regional offices as work proceeded.
Additional preparation of engineering designs by consultants was carried
out satisfactorily when needed. The training for technical staff was
carried out at the regional offices of JAE and financed exclusively by JAE
budgetary funds. The fellowship programs for post-graduates included two
one-year courses in USA and UK, one in Belgium and attendance in 18
seminars or short courses.
ii.      Prior to implementation of the project  road contractors were
engaged exclusively in construction without any road maintenance activity.
The budgetary problems under the project, subsequent reductions in JAE
staff during the 1980-84 period, and Bank advice led to the establishment
for the first time in Portugal of road maintenance by contractor. This
took place after the reduction of the force account system which however,
was strengthened through training. At the end of the project, the quality
of maintenance was considerably higher than at the start, and 20 percent of
maintenance 'eeds were contracted. An increase to 60 percent is targeted
under the ongoing Third Highway Project.
F. iroject Results
12.      The Road Rehabilitation component achieved physical targets
substantially above appraisal but over a period that was more than two
years longer than expected. Because of the depreciation of the Escudo
against the US$ (para. 9), and strong competition among contractors
(para. 28), the rehabilitation costs in US$ were lower than appraised.
This permitted rehabilitation of 1,540 km roads against the 1,000 km
estimated at appraisal. The budgetary difficulties in road maintenance
resulted in the introduction of efficient, contractual maintenance in 1985
(para. 11). The training of technical personnel and the granting of
fellowships to postgraduates developed differently than envisioned at
appraisal but were satisfactory. Training was provided and financed by the
JAE, at the workshops in Lisbon and Oporto. The Fellowship program
focussed on short courses and seminars geared to JAE institutional needs
instead of on long cours6s (para. 10).
13.      Another beneficial institutional result of the project came from
the reassignment, from JAE headquarters in Lisbon to the new regional
offices, of personnel needed for design and supervision of the
rehabilitation contracts. This decision improved considerably the
institutional capacity and experience of the four regional offices and



provided in-house training to young professionals. The project, however,
failed to fulfill an important covenant regarding enforcement of limits of
vehicle loads and dimensions in Portugal. Although during project
execution, the Borrower and the Bank recognized that the existing axle load
limit of 10 tons was probably uneconomically low, the reality is that the
covenant was never implemented, changed or waived and at project completion
the axle load policy remained erratic. New axle load (13 tons) legislation
required by Portugal access (1986) into the EC has been prepared and is
being enforced under the Bank financed Third Highway Project (para. 24).
14.      One of the criteria for accepting road sections in the project was
that the economic rate of return (ERR) should not be less than 121. Many
of the sections had very high estimated ERR's, often 501 and above. The
ERR's have been recalculated based on actual construction costs and traffic
flows (Table 4). Of the 84 sections included, 52, or 62%, had higher ERR's
than estimated whereas 32, or 38%, had lower ones. The reasons for the
higher ERR's are both lower than anticipated construction costs and more
traffic, whereas for all the lower than anticipated ERR's there were
important cost overruns, up to 89%, and in some cases, lower traffic than
the forecast. More than 901 of the sections meet the 121 ERR criterion.
Only seven sections fall below this limit with two not reaching a positive
ERR. In 42% of the sections traffic was somewhat overestimated with 12
sections (16b of total) having more than 30% less traffic than estimated
(T*ble 2).  Of these 12 sections, 6 also had investment costs more than 20%
higher than foreseen (Table 3 and 4). Although the actual costs for
individual sections varied considerably from the estimates, the global
actual and estimated costs are practically identical. Overall, the
economic impact of the project was positive.
G. Project Sustainability
15.      Execution of the Second Highway Project was consistent with the
objectives and priorities that the Government set for the highway
subsector. In thle last decade (1979-88), the Government invested about
US$1.5 billion equivalent for rehabilitation and upgrading of the main road
network. These efforts have been assisted by Bank support through the
First, Second, and Third Highway Projects. The First Highway Project
started, on a pilot basis, a highway rehabilitation program (490 km; total
cost US$56.6 m) for ti.e region of Lisbon. The Second Highway Project
extended the pilot program .hrough a satisfactory implementation by the
four regional centers to Portugal as a whole (1,540 km; total cost
US$93.4 m.).  The Third Highway Project (2,500 km; expected total cost
US$400 million) will continue the overall rehabilitation and maintenance by
contractor and start a program of new bypasses to avoid congestion in
important towns. With the contribution of the ongoing Third Highway
Project, the Bank will have participated in about 20 percent of total
investments in the main road network during 1979-88.
16.      The development of force account maintenance capabilities was an
objective of the First Highway Project and continued under the Second
Highway Project, mainly through training of JAE staff members. The
budgetary difficulties during project implementation led to an important
innovation in Portugal, the establishment of contractual maintenance
(para. 11). Maintenance by contractor stimulates competition among the



local firms; it has improved quality and lowered costs in the maintenance
of the main road network. It also provides small firms with an opportunity
for development and growth allowing them to compete in their own
geographical area with larger firms.
17.      On the whole the project's contribution to institutional
development of the highway subsector is entirely positive. The project has
achieved considerable success in the regionalization of works and in
delegating accountability to the regional centers together with the success
of maintenance by contractor. The Government has been able to sustain
these institutional developments.
H. Bank Performance
18.      The Second Highway Project was identified as a direct outgrowth of
the First Highway Project (Loan 1334-PO), continuing development of a
highway maintenance program and a priority rehabilitation program. The
First Highway Project experienced difficulties which delayed it nearly four
years, until 1984. Appraisal of the Second Project should have concluded
that overlapping the implementation of the two projects would negatively
affect them both.
19.      Once the Second Project began, the Bank remained closely
involved. A total of 16 supervision missions were carried out, matny of
which took place during the critical period of 1980-1984 (para. 9). A
crucial decision was the approval in 1984 at the Borrower's request of an
increase of Bank financing of the rehabilitation component from 35 to 50X,
based on a reassessment of the foreign exchange component. Also the
establishment of a project Special Account was important (para. 9). This
decision, helped by the economic improvement in the country, proved
instrumental to the satisfactory completion of the project and is being
repeated satisfactorily under the ongoing Third Highway Project. It should
probably have been taken earlier.
20.      The Bank required that for each section of the rehabilitation
program a feasibility study show a minimum economic rate of return of 12.
However, it may be argued that once agreement was reached on the
methodology, based on about five examples in different types of terrain,
the Bank could have waived the condition that each of all 84 section,
varying in length from 3 to 70 km, be approved by it before being put to
bid. This requirement flooded the Bank with documentation and delayed the
bidding process. It implied a lack of confidence in JAE and its
consultants at a time when less advanced countries were already eligible
for sector lending. The requirement has been discontinued under the
ongoing Third Highway Project.
21.      The Bank ought to have persisted in the application of some loan
covenants. Although the Bank pressed for provision of adequate local funds
for rehabilitation and maintenance, the covenant (Section 4.04 of the Loan
Agreement) requiring dimensions and axle-load of vehicles consistent with
the structural and geometric design standard of the roads was not
enforced. The legal single axle-load limit of 10 tons was inadequate but
no action to change it was taken (para. 13) until the implementation of the
Third Highway Project.

I. Borrower Performance
22.      Most of the loan covenants were directed at committing the
Government to (i) respect implementation schedules and agreed standards and
(ii) provide, as promptly as needed, the funds, staff, facilities, and
other resources required for the project. The preparation of the Five-Year
(1980-84) Plan, the base of the project, was satisfactorv, particularly on
the Road Rehabilitation Program; the training and the fellowship programs
being formulated on a more ad hoc basis. The ability of the NCEL to
contribute to the preparation of final designs was overestimated. The
Borrower's overestimation, shared by the Bank, of its capacity to finance
the project remains the main cause of the delays and difficulties
experienced during the 1980-84 period when the lack of local funds was
aggravated by the simultaneous execution of a delayed First Highway Project
(para. 8). The Borrower request of a 50% instead of a 35% Bank
participation once the First Highway Project was completed in 1984 and
subsequent Bank approval were the most important decisions allowing
completion of the project (para. 9). Further application of this
experience--avoid excessive overlapping in the execution of consecutive
projects, maintain 50% Bank participation, and use of a project Special
Account to facilitate disbursements--is leading to a satisfactory and
timely implementation of the Third Highway Project. The supervision of
works was always satisfactory, and the Borrower provided enough competent
staff through it regional offices, uider the Directorate of Road
Maintenance. The post-graduate fellowship and training programs were
approved and begun by January 1983 instead of July 1, 1981, (latest date
specified in the Loan Agreement) and had considerable post-appraisal
changes. These changes--full in-house training (1983-85) for technical
staff with existing Borrower facilities and shorter courses and seminars
for post-graduates--were in consonance with prevailing conditions and
therefore accepted by the Bank.
23.      Compliance with the loan covenant requiring adequate road
maintenance met with difficulties during the 1980-84 period, due to lack of
funds and progressive reduction of force-account equi.pment and staff within
JAE. The Borrower's decision in 1985 to compensate for a 20% reduction in
maintenance capacity through the establishment of maintenance by contractor
led to a considerable improvement in the quality and costs of maintenance
in the following years, particularly under the ongoing Third Highway
Project (para. 11).
24.      The loan covenant requiring the Borrower to take all stepb
necessary to ensure that the dimensions and axle-loads of vehicles using
its road system shall be consistent With the structural and geometric
design standard of such roads was not enforced for reasons explained in
para. 13. The Government under the ongoing Third Highway Project has
approved a 13 ton single axle load limit regulation, which is being
enforced through a network of twenty weigh stations.
J. Proiect Relationship
25.      The Bank/Borrower relationship during the project was satisfactory
notwithstanding differences of view on a few issues. When the Bank
commented on the delays in the final designs because of the tardiness in



- 8 -
performing soil analysis by the NCEL, the JAE hired consultants and avoided
further delays (para. 8). However, when the Bank reiterated to the
Ministry of Finance in 1981-83 the need to provide the required local funds
(para. 8), the request was not complied with because of the difficult
economic situation. The Bank, in 1984, did not agree to the Borrower's
request to raise the LCB ceiling from US$2.5 million to US$5.0 million; the
request was based on the fact that only local contractors bid under ICB and
that LCB procurement procedures were more expeditive, but the Bank did not
accept this argument and felt that it would be in the interest of the
project to maintain the original ICB limit.
26.      The Borrower's relations with contractors, and to a minor degree
with consultants, also experienced difficult moments. Contractors
expressed the desire to be paid the foreign exchange component directly by
the Bank in order to improve delicate cash-flow situations generated by
delays on payments of works certificates. Although the Bank was willing,
the Borrower did not agree to the proposal citing the Portuguese budgetary
law which requires that the whole cost of the project is to be advanced to
the executing agency and the foreign component cost reimbursed to the
National Treasury.
27.      It is clear that the main weakness in the project relationship was
the scarce provision of local funds by the financially strapped Borrower
and that most other problems were a direct consequence of this weakness.
K. Contracting and Consulting Services
28.      The consultants and contractors played an important but not
comfortable role in the execution of the project. Particularly difficult
was the situation confronted by the contracting industry. The loss of the
overseas provinces, the economic situation, the labor legislation, and the
lack of sufficient work produced enormous tension in the contLracting
industry and to a lesser degree in the consulting firms. Itn order to
guarantee survival most of the bid prices were merely based on the
financing of labor and material. When the loan was fully disbursed the
length of roads rehabilitated was considerably higher than estimated at
appraisal, mainly because of the devaluation of the Escudos, but also
because of strong competition among contractors.
L. Proiect Documentation and Data
29.      The legal documents were sufficiently clear and specific for the
implementation of the project. However, the agreements reached and
reflected in the legal documents were too strict on the fulfillment of
conditions delaying unnecessarily the decision-making process during
project implementation. The requirement of an independent review and
approval for each road section in a country like Portugal should have been
avoided and substituted by a provision (para. 20) which would allow the
Borrower to select the specific items according to agreed criteria. The
appraisal report provided a useful framework for the Bank and the Borrower
during project implementation. It could, however, have provided a more
precise evaluation of the quantitative capacity of the NCEL to prepare



final designs. The appraisal report also concluded that there were not
significant project risks, even as the implementation of the First Highway
Project was already experiencing difficulties in the provision of local
funds.
30.      This PCR was drafted on the basis of documents available in the
Bank, including the SAR, the Loan Agreement, supervision and other Bank
staff reports, progress reports from the Borrower and correspondence
between the Borrower and the Bank. The provision of data by the Borrower
was adequate, but overlapping, and repetition of information in reports was
common. The chronological sequence on the presentation of achievements was
not always followed. The progress reports prepared by JAE permitted
supervision of the project in general, but they quite often missed details,
making the data gathering for the PCR quite difficult.

PART II:* PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A. Comments on Parts I and III
31.      In 1978, JAE faced an emergency when much of the road surfacing
was damaged by exceptionally severe storms. In most cases, temporary
measures had to be adopted promptly and on a large scale, and it was clear
from the outset that the effects of these would be quite limited in
duration. Once this period was over, a road surface rehabilitation plan
was launched that included measures ensuring that surfaces would have a
useful life of between 8 and 10 years. The First Highway Project received
US$24 million in World Bank financing. In order to continue its support of
this important effort to reconstruct the most damaged and used roads, the
World Bank agreed to finance a second loan (US$40 million).
32.      The Loan Agreement was signed on July 27, 1979.  Under the terms
of the Agreement, project execution was to be completed on July 30, 1984.
However, there were two extensions: the first until June 30, 1985, and the
secotnd until June 30, 1986, although the Bank kept the accoutlt open until
December 31, 1986. These extensions were essentially due to the budgetary
constraints applied during the 1980-84 period. As a result, few new works
could be undertaken, and this inevitably affected the schedule of the
Second Highway Project. In addition, because of the constraints on
public-sector investment, the prices quoted in bids were very low, and
consequently some contractors were unable to complete the works assigned to
them. This resulted in cancellations of contracts and the need to organize
additional procurement procedures, thus considerably delaying project
execution. The constant rise in the value of the uS$ also affected the
withdrawal of loan proceeds.
33.      While these somewhat unforeseeable causes were essentially the
result of Portugal's economic position and the moderate recovery that began
in 1976, an additional factor unrelated to the country's financial position
also served to delay project start-up. As a result of JAE's experience in
the previous project, it was more demanding in the Second Highway Project
with regard to the technical quality of the rehabilitation projects,
particularly in its call for more accurate specifications and greater
attention to road safety and drainage. Consequently, the consultants hired
* Part II is a translation from the Borrower's original in Portuguese.



were unable to provide responses within the scheduled periods. As a
result, the project preparation ph.ase was somewhat longer than originally
planned, and this explains the initial time overrun. It has become evident
that in future JAE should provide its technical staff with the resources
necessary for performing these activities. To this end, pavement condition
evaluation equipment has been acquired, and training has been initiated.
- 34.     Nevertheless, it is believed that commencement of the Second
Highway Project could have been postponed in order to ensure that a
significant number of projects were ready to be launched, or already
underway. This approach, together with the provision of retroactive
payments up to a specified total, would have made it possible to speed up
project execution, or at least would have prevented delays in the initial
phase.
B. Evaluation of Bank's Performance in the Proiect
35.      The World Bank was supportive in its monitoring of the situation
and agreed to measures for minimizing the problems that had arisen, so that
the entire proceeds of the loan could be withdrawn within a reasonable
period. In addition to these measures, the following modifications to the
Agreement were discussed and approved:
-    an iacrease in the percentage of civil works to be financed
from 35b to 50% (from January 1, 1984);
-    the inclusion of additional works; and
-    the establishment of a Special Account to enable disbursement
applications to be processed more promptly.
These measures were decisive factors in improving project execuoton.
36.      Also noteworthy was the action taken by thte Wonrld PianK vis-a-vis
the government in order to ensure that the budget cuts applied to JAE would
be minimized. In spite of the constraints, priority was consistently given
to works financed by the institution, and this enabled a significant
percentage of investment to be devoted to maintenance, thus preventing the
road system from deteriorating once again, as it had done before 1977.
37.      The threshold set for international competitive bidding was also
regarded as too low. While unduly increasing bureaucracy, it provided no
advantages in practice, because--as had been expected--no international
firms participated, and bids were submitted only by Portuguese
contractors. Of the 63 contracts, one was awarded to a Spanish
consortium. It has not been possible to analyze this issue, because the
Bank held the opposing viewpoint, i.e. that any such change in procedures
would be of no advantage to the project.
C. Evaluation of Borrower's Performance in the Project
38.      The economic analysis showed a high rate of return for the
pavement rehabilitation program. Changes in construction costs were
essentially due to inflation, since this made it necessary to pay for price



- 12 -
changes, in accordance with current legislation (prices remained unchanged
in only 21% of contracts).  Discrepancies in average daily traffic were
almost exclusively limited to the figures for 1985. Subsequent analysis
showed inaccuracies in the estimates for that year ot about 10%. In any
case, the studies of rates of return made in the final phase of the project
were accompanied by a sensitivity analysis that tested for capital cost
increases and changes in traffic ranging from 10% to 20%. In our opinion,
periodic maintenance works, because of the amounts normally entailed, do
not justify the necessity for advance approval by the World Bank for each
individual project financed, because the formalities required increase the
overall time taken.
39.      In fact, it is considered that, in future, efforts should be made
to reduce the time spent on procurement, which is already considerable in
the case of international competitive bidding. In addition to the above
example, the requirement for advance aproval by the Bank for all bids or
draft contracts seems unjustifiable, except in special cases.
D. Assessment of Bank/Borrower Relationship during the Project
40.      Good relations with the members of World Bank statt, and the
thorough knowledge that they possess of JAE management, created an
atmosphere of confidence that e_ventually permitted these problems to be
overcome.
41.      In recent years, there has been a gradual reduction in works
executed on force account. This is not only because of reductions in
operating budgets, but also because of the difficulties in hiring personneL
resulting from the freeze imposed on the Central Administration. JAE was
consequently obliged to undertake the experiment of having routine
maintenance performed under contract, and this procedure received the World
Bank's wholehearted support from the outset.
42.      In 1980, JAE began to devote considerable efforts to
regionalization, and this process had to be accompanied by a training
program to enable the staff of the Regional Services to assume their new
responsibilities. This objective was achieved, and it thus became possible
for all the work entailed in project preparation and monitoring to be
coordinated directly by the Regional Services. In a certain sense, the
Second Highway Project has strengthened the need for effective
decentralization, and encouraged the regionalization process. The periodic
World Bank supervision missions were valuable in promoting the project's
execution, and strengthening the institutional coordination that has
considerably increased over recent years, partly as a result of the
implementation of projects financed by the World Bank.

Comments
The First Highway Project was the pilot project to start rehabilitation and maintenance
works in Portugal. The Second Highway Project extended experiences learnt under the
first on a nationwide scale. It also introduced, on a pilot basis, routine maintenance
by contractors following reduction of torce account resources (staff and equipment) in
JAE. The Third Highway Project continues the nationwide rehabilitation program,
consolidates routine maintenance by contractors and introduces a program of new
investments (bypasses to congested cities).

Comments - The first requebt for a Second Highway project was made by Lhe JAE it
July 1977 to a Bank Supervision mission. JAE/Bank agreed on a project extending
nation-wide the pilot rehabilitation/maintenance programs initiated under the
First Highway Project. Due to delays on the preparation of the Transport Master
Plan (First Highway) the project could not be based on it. Preparation took
somewhat more than scheduled because of delays by the GPP on the prtparation of
the initial Rehabilitation works estimates and long discussions lbout the
composition of the T/A and training programs in view of the ongoing
regionalization of the JAE.  Appraisal, Board presentation, signatutre stnd
effectiveness followed scheduled dates. However, completi-n (c: the project iias
delayed.  The proportion of works completed at the plantted date it project

omments - The exchange rate expected at appraisal was based on US$1 - Escudos 46,994 (August 1978). Actual costs in USS derive from stream of
isburseents over 1980/86 for each component with the following annual exchange rates:  1980:  50; 1981:  62; 1982:  79; 19B3:  111; 1984:  142; 19tS:
70; and 1986: 150. The average exchange rate over the project implementation period was US$1 * Esc. 123.6. Due to the r1se in the US$ exchange rate
uring project implementation, the actual cost in USS was 18 percent less than estimated notwithistanding a significant increase in physical achievements;
ctually the depreciation of 38 percent was partly compensated by physical achievement- that were about 20 percent higher than expected (in number of km. IS
more but this because the extra 540 km. needed less important rehabilitationi than the oiter's.  The consultants services eAperienced a considerable
eduction because of the intense participation of the JAE on the designs.  Training ot t.iuicical staff was fully carried out by JAE under current budget.
The fellowship program was reduced to the most urgent needs with considerable savings
The cost overrun in local currency was about 75 percent, reflecting the depreciation of thL. Etcudo and high rates of isnflation (1979 to 1986 respectively
7, 20. 22. 26. 29. 18, 12 and 10 percent).  However, taking into consideration the additional works eAecuted under the project. tne cost overrun was
reduced to about 55 percent.

Comments - The Government financed S7 percent of the rehabilitation works which include a volume 20
percent greater than appraised. As the foreign component of the rehabilitation works is 50 percent.
this represents a 7 percent of foreign exchange expenses actually incurred by the Governmcnt on
contract (rehabilitation) commitments.

Comments - The utilization of Consultants was higher than expected because of the
help provided to the NCEL and to JAE to complete rehabilitation aesign for 1,540
instead of 1,000 km. of roads. The training--not detailed at appraisal--was that
required by JAE needs.  Fellowships in m/m were considerably lower than expected,
because JAE and the Bank realized that long term (one year) post-graduate
fellowsships were not needed and also could affect negatively the operation of JAE.

Comments - The economic reevaluation of the major road rehabilitation works takes
into account the traffic data obtained in 1985 nationwide survey as well as partial
counts in 1986 and 1987. Construction costs and maintenance costs are actual.
Construction costs are those paid under the different road contracts, including
physical contingencies and escalation costs. Maintenance costs are those provided
under the Maintenance Management System being applied regularly in Portugal.
