3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The project's development objectives were to: (i) improve the health and nutrition status of
slurn-dwellers in the project cities; (ii) build the capacity of city and municipal governments to plan, finance
and implement cost-effective slum health and nutrition programs, in partnership with communities, NGOs
and the Department of Health (DOH); (iii) help slum communities identify their own health, nutrition and
environmental problems and participate in planning, implementing and monitoring appropriate
interventions; and (iv) help DOH develop policies and strategies to improve the reach and cost-effectiveness
of health and nutrition delivery systems.
These objectives were appropriate given that: (i) health and nutrition indicators in the Philippines
were considerably worse than would be expected for a country of its level of per capita income; (ii) some
health and nutrition indicators in urban slums were worse than in rural areas; and (iii) there had been
under-investment in health infrastructure in the slums compared even to rural areas. The objectives were
consistent with the Bank's CAS objective of poverty alleviation, and with the Government's five year plan
objectives of improving basic social services and focusing them on the poor. The project's capacity
development objectives for communities and local governments were also in line with Bank and
Government strategies. The capacity-building objective for local governments was particularly important,
since during project preparation the Government passed legislation devolving health services from central
to local government units (LGUs).
3.2 Revised Objective:
Because of poor disbursements, the project was restructured after a mid-term review. It was not
resubmitted to the Board, because neither the development objectives nor the component structure was
changed.
3.3 Original Components:
The project had four components:
(i)    Service Delivery (US$51 .6m), aiming to improve the access and quality of key primary health care
services for the poor living in slums;
(ii)  Institutional Development (US$14.5m), supporting improvements in the capacity of the 21 city
and municipal health departments to plan, manage, finance and implement their public health programs,
and improvements in the capacity of the central, regional and district levels of the DOH to provide technical
assistance, training, communications and logistical support to these units;
(iii)  Community Partnerships for Health (US$4.9m), supporting community mobilization and
community-based activities aimed at improving the health and nutrition of the urban poor; and
(iv)   Policy Research and Evaluation (US $4m), supporting research and evaluation studies. The main
focus of the operational research (OR) was on testing altemative service delivery models to see which were
most appropriate in the urban slum environment.
The choice and design of these components was clearly linked to the development objectives. The
project's narrow focus, on the health sector and in 21 local governments (out of more than 1,500 in the
country) in 3 major metropolitan areas, was prudent, given past implementation difficulties with
multisectoral urban development projects and because this was the first Bank-financed project to be
- 2 -



implemented afler the devolution of health services to LGUs. The service delivery interventions in
component I included prenatal and postpartum care, safe birth, family planning, immunization,
management of diarrhea and acute respiratory infection, TB and sexually transmitted diseases, as well as
micro-nutrient supplementation and prevention of PEM. These were all high priority primary health care
activities, with which the implementing agency was experienced. Component 3 of the project was
institutionally complex, in that it involved developing three-way partnerships between local governments,
NGOs and community organizations; but there had been successful experience with this under the
Bank-fmanced Philippines Ilealth Development Project. It was therefore reasonable to assume that
components I and 3 of the project were within DOH's implementation capacity.
The scope and complexity of the activities in Components 2 and 4, while each justified in itself,
was too great for the government's implementation capacity in the difficult environment after devolution.
With regard to component 2, the challenge of increasing local governments' health management capacity,
and reorienting DOH to build the capacity of local governments rather than deliver health services itself,
was enormous; however, this effort, though complex, was an unavoidable one after devolution. It was
over-ambitious for the project, however, to have expected simultaneously to reorient health sector training,
as component 2 planned. Component 4 proposed more than 15 OR studies, in addition to baseline and
endline studies, and this too was unrealistic.
3.4 Revised (CotpotneeH:
The four original components were retained but within each, priorities were redefined, components
simplified and standardized protocols adopted. USS20m was cut from the project, since slow past
disbursements coupled with exchange rate savings meant that it was impossible to spend the original credit
amount. In retrospect, the cut should have been larger, but this would have been politically difficult, since
this was the last IDA-financed project in the Philippines.
Within the components, the following changes were made:
Component 1. Procedures ior targeting the urban poor were revised and clearly specified, and the number
of monitoring indicators was reduced from 27 to a more manageable 6. Interventions were prioritized in
three areas: (i) T B control through the implementation of DOTS, in response to the finding of a
project-financed prevalence survey that TB rates in the slums were some of the highest in the world; (ii) a
renewed focus on integrated provision of MCH care; and (iii) some discretionary funding for local
governments to spend on local health priorities.
Component 2. The idea of systematic across-the-board management systems improvement for local
governments was dropped for lack of time to implement it. A more lirnited program of management training
for local governmnDts, coupled with a demand-driven, piecemeal approach to systems improvement was
proposed. The proposed reform of health sector training strategies was dropped, because it was not feasible
to develop and implement a plan for this in the time available.
Component 3. An 'apex NGO' was hired to help implement the local government-NGO-community
partnership scheme, with the aim of increasing the number of sub-projects, and improving the consistency
and quality of work done by partrner NGOs.
Component 4. The number of OR studies was reduced to 4.
These changes were sensible responses to limited implementation capacity at both central and local
govenmment levels. II would have been more realistic to further limit Component 4 to one OR study.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
The quality of the project design was satisfactory in that: (i) the development objectives were
consistent with the Government's policy framework and the CAS; (ii) the components reflected the
objectives; and (iii) the main service delivery interventions were consistent with best practices at the time.
Project strategies were conmnendable in that they included a heavy emphasis on institutional development,
which was appropriate following health service devolution; and an innovative strategy for targeting the
urban poor, which had not been attempted before on a systematic basis. Project complexity overall was not
so great as to prevent achievement of the project objectives. A positive feature of project preparation was
the high degree of participation from the local governments who would be implementing the project. With
regard to project implementation readiness, a project implementation plan was prepared.
The project's quality at entry is nevertheless rated as unsatisfactory, by the Bank's current
standards, in the following respects: (i) the Project Management Office (PMO) was not fully staffed until
well into the first year of project implementation; and there is no record of arrangements agreed for
procurement and financial management. (ii) The following had not been completed by effectiveness:
guidelines for implementing the strategy for reproductive cycle targeting of core project MCH services; and
objectives and indicators for project institutional development activities in the local governments, or TORs
for key consultancy for local government management systems improvement.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The main source of outcome data is the endline evaluation survey financed under the project.
Though completed, this was not released to DOH or the ICR mission, since the consultants had not been
paid for it-an illustration that UHNP's severe management problems continued right to the end. It was
therefore not possible to make a professional evaluation of achievement of outcome against original or
revised objectives.
The project's performance improved substantially in its last two years, after the project was
restructured and a new manager was appointed (see below). Despite this, the project's overall achievement
must be rated as unsatisfactory, since each of the project's four original development objectives were only
partially met, as follows:
(i)   Improve the health and nutrition status of slum-dwellers in the project cities. Certain
health indicators in the slums improved during the project period, though for methodological
reasons it is not possible to quantify the project's contribution to this. Some project service delivery
related activities were well implemented, such as civil works and the TB control program. But
serious shortfalls in the quantity and timeliness of drugs and equipment procured under the
project, recruitment of only half the planned number of additional health staff, delays in producing
integrated MCH protocols and failure to complete two thirds of the integrated MCH training mean
that output cannot be rated as satisfactory.
(ii)   Build the capacity of city and municipal governments to plan, finance and implement
cost-effective slum health and nutrition programs, in partnership with communities, NGOs and
the DOH. Though some planning and management training was provided to local governments in
the last two years of the project, and capacity development of the local governments in the area of
health education was successful, the key activity of improving local government health
management systems was begun too late, and could therefore not be systematically implemented.
- 4 -



(iii)   Help slum communities identify their own health, nutrition and environmental problems
and participate in planning, implementing and monitoring appropriate interventions. All local
governments succeeded in developing partnerships with NGOs and communities, but this happened
too late to achieve the core objective of giving urban slum conmmunities more control over their
health and nutrition status. Only about 100 sub-projects for partnership activities were
implemented, as against the 800 planned at appraisal.
(iv)   Help DOH develop policies and strategies which would improve the outreach and
cost-effectiveness of health and nutrition delivery systems. Though a new system for targeting
health services to the urban poor was introduced under the project, other key strategy development
activities, especially in the key areas of protein-energy malnutrition control and environmental
health, were not implemented.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Component 1. With regard to the TB services, systematic M&E was conducted after the
restructuring. The two objectives of the revised project were to detect at least 70% of the estimated
smear-positive TB cases and cure at least 85% of them. At project completion, all facilities were
implementing DOTS. In terms of case detection, most areas were close to the target of 70%. Cure rates
were going up, but there was quite some variation between LGUs. With an average success rate (combining
cured and treatment completed) of 80% in 2000, the project had come very close to the target of 85%.
Except for the TB component, the project did not succeed in establishing a practical, reliable and
technically appropriate M&E system to routinely track performance indicators for service delivery. The
original 25 project indicators had problems of technical appropriateness and measurability. The revised
project proposed 6 core indicators and 18 process indicators. However, devolution and weak M&E
capacity at both DOH and LGU levels meant that no systematic reporting of the indicators took place.
During the last supervision mission, a set of indicators were agreed for use in the final evaluation, which
did not materialize.
However, routine service delivery data points to certain improvement in access to MCH services by
the poor. As shown in the table below, for 5 out of 9 outcome indicators of MCH services, data for the
urban poor in thefirst six months of 2001 are either equivalent or better than those among city-wide
population for all 1997.

Children with Vitamin A supplement        NA             96%             62%
If these data reflect the true situation, they are encouraging. However, it is impossible to make a
confident statement that the project was responsible.

It is clear, however, that the project had significant outputs uwhich might ha\ e contributed to an
improvement in urban poor indicators, even though the inputs were much smaller tItan what was planned at
appraisal. On the positive side:
(i)    114 health facilities were built or upgraded and equipped under the project representing an
increase of about a quarter over the pre-existing infrastructurc.
(ii)   617 additional health staff were financed and trained under the project; mostly midwives
and nurses assigned to health centers and outreach work.
(iii)  In the last two years of the project, USS2m of TB drugs v. ere procured (as against the
original budget of US$700,000 for the whole p]-oject). With these drugs universally available, and
all local governments trained in the new 'DOTS' approach to I B control. by miid 2000 case
detection rates rose close to the post-restructuring target of 70( 1. and the cobnbn,ed
completed-treatment-and-cure rate was 8000, almost meeting the targe. of 85%
On the negative side:
(i)    The additional midwives and nurses represented only about half the numnber planned and
budgeted at appraisal, based on the local governments' own assessments of their needs. Local
governments were prevented from hiring more by legislation which liminted the proportion ol their
budget spent on salaries as opposed to other operating costs.
(ii)   Implementation of the planned integration of MCH I services ;waIs delayed until the last two
years of the project.
(iii)  Because of the lack of procurement planning and the poor implementation of procurement,
no TB drugs and only a limited quantity of MCH drugs were prcn red prior to the last two years of
the project. Deliveries were not only too small to meet local government.' needs. but also
sporadic, and sometimes included types of drugs which were not a prionty at the local level. Some
of the medical equipment procured was defecti- e.
Component 2. Management Systems Improvement,; CapacitLy I?ei'clo; n. in Planning and
Evaluation. As noted above, these activities began only after project reslructuring, and therefore could not
achieve originally planned outcomes.
Information, Education and Communication (iEl. This key activity was financcd through an
Australian grant for the first three years of the project, and with Australian technical assistance. Since the
grant did not flow through government channels, this activity did not sutffer from the tinancing delays
experienced by nearly all others. An evaluation by an Australian tech-ical. expert indicates that IEC
strategies, messages and materials were developed, many IEC campaigns wNere contducted by the local
governments, and there was evidence of resulting behavioral change. The capacity of both local
governments and local communities to plan and organize IEC activities was strentTthened.
Administrative and Training Infrastructure. Ten healtlh offices and ori, regional training center
were constructed as planned. As with the project-financed health centers, the ciil works und(ler this
component were implemented well, because of strong demand from the local gonemmvnts, the presence of a
proactive individual in charge of this activity in the PMO, and tech:-.Ical assistance from Bank supervision
missions.

Project Management and Coordination. Project management was very weak until the last two
years of the project. Although two management consultants were hired at different times to help the PMO,
their output did not prove to be acceptable to their clients, and made no difference.
Component 3. This component was slow to get off the ground, with only 46 community
partnership sub-projects approved in the four years prior to restructuring. After restructuring, an apex
NGO was procured to help other NGOs develop sub-projects, and this system proved successful, in that 59
sub-projects were then developed in a year and a half.
Component 4. Baseline, midterm and endline surveys. Owing to problems in organizing the
design of the survey and in procurement, the baseline survey was only completed three years into the
project, and the midterm survey was therefore cancelled. The endline survey took place as planned,
although it was not released. A high quality TB survey was financed under the project, and its finding that
TB prevalence was twice as high in urban slums as in rural areas was a major factor in influencing DOH to
make TB control a policy priority and a priority of the restructured project.
Workload and Work Routines Study. This was not carried out.
OR on women 's health, nutrition and environmental health. No OR was begun before the project
was restructured, and only one of the four OR studies in the restructured project was attempted. Process
documentation indicates that the study results are not valid, because procurement problems meant that food
supplements were not purchased for some study areas, while nutrition activities were carried out by some
local governments in areas meant to be controls.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
These were not calculated. But the health interventions included in the project (such as
immunization, diarrhea, tuberculosis and acute respiratory infection control, matemal health care and
family planning, micro-nutrient and protein-energy malnutrition control) are all ones which the Bank's
global sector work has indicated to have high cost-benefit ratios. The project planned to increase the
cost-effectiveness of MCH interventions by moving from a vertical to an integrated approach; there was
only limited success in doing this, and the benefits if any are not quantifiable. During the project, new and
more cost-effective approaches to TB control was developed and promoted by WHO. These were
introduced in the last two years of the project, with considerable success in improving case detection and
cure rates.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable for public health projects.
4.5 Institutional developnment impact:
Overall, this was weak. Local govemrnent management systems were not improved on a systematic
basis as planned. Though there was some training of local governments in health planning and
management, this came late in the project. On the positive side, the IEC sub-component left local
govermments with a significantly increased capacity to plan and manage IEC programs, and DOH regions
and districts with a strengthened capacity to support them. And the partnership-building activities under
component 3 left all local govemments with an increased capacity to mobilize and work with NGOs and
communities.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5. 1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
National and local elections held in the first year of implementation meant that many newly
elected local government executives were unaware of or uncommitted to the project, and
the PMO had to spend much time rebuilding commitment.
Support from the Bank was weak during the first four years of the project.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Serious weaknesses in DOH procurement capacity and procedures, and reluctance to
accept Bank procurement procedures, contributed to very serious procurement delays.
Serious weaknesses in financial management capacity and procedures at both central and
local government levels contributed to slow disbursements.
There were eight DOH Secretaries during the life of the project (preparation through
completion). Besides lack of consistent direction and support from the top, it also led to
frequent changes of other DOH officials at middle and lower levels.
Lack of support and monitoring from oversight agencies.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Lack of project readiness at effectiveness.
Although devolution was legislated in 1992, DOH took several years to develop
procedures for management and financing under devolution.
The PMO was staffed late and with individuals inexperienced in managing large
donor-funded projects. There were five project coordinators during the life of the project,
only the last of whom was full time.
There was insufficient intervention by DOH management to bring the project back on
track.
5.4 Costs and financing.
Disbursements under the project were only US$14.5m (21% of the credit) at the time of the project
midterm review, which took place after almost four years of implementation, due primarily to delays in
procurement and weak financial management (see Borrower performance section for details). This
prompted the project restructuring, and the cut of US$20m from the credit. By the end of the project,
which was extended by six months through June, 2001, US$35m had been disbursed, half the original
credit.
Part of the undisbursed balance was due to foreign exchange savings owing to a progressive
decline in the peso from 26 to the dollar at appraisal to 52 at closing. In peso terms, the project spent 72%
of the budget at appraisal. Furthermore, 11% of the original peso budget for the project was in respect of
the 215 field staff that local governments opted not to hire. It is noteworthy that no less than 43% of the
peso spending was recorded in the last year and a half of the project, following the takeover of a new
Project Coordinator after project restructuring.

Total                                               1855    1343            72
Failure to implement PEM control activities and to hire the consultants for management systems
improvement, together with the poor performance of the community partnerships component, explains the
under-spending in the relevant categories in the above table. The over-spending on drugs was due to the
very large purchases of TB and MCH drugs made in the final years of the project. This hides significant
under-spending on drugs earlier in the project. The overspending in the operating cost categories shows
that the administrative overhead proved to be much higher than expected.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Except for the service delivery component, the sustainability of activities for institutional
development, community partnership and operations research is unlikely. Specifically:
*      The health facilities built under the project will continue to be operated. Considerable
training in the implementation of DOTS has taken place and is very likely to be useful for
the national TB control program. There will probably be adequate supplies of TB drugs,
since these are to be provided by the central Government as a national health priority.
MCH and other drugs and supplies, which are a local government responsibility, will
continue but may be under-funded.
*      Nearly two thirds of the more than 600 additional contractual health workers funded under
the project are being absorbed onto the permanent staff of the local governments-but
more than a third will be lost, even though all participating governments signed an
agreement to retain all project staff after the project.
*      Local governments will continue some IEC activities, but less than half the project local
governments plan to fund the purchase of IEC materials. How much IEC will be done will
depend on what resources they can access from donors such as UNICEF.
DOH has no systematic strategy for continuing efforts to strengthen the health
management capacity of local governments, nor has it budgeted the funds for this.
Local government-NGO-community partnership activities are likely to continue, but local
governments are unlikely to commit funds to them. If DOH cannot provide matching grant
finance, and the only source of funding is the NGO movement, then this effective way of
-9-



mobilizing communities and increasing outreach will remain under-exploited.
6.2 Tranisition arrangement to regular operations:
Local governments are already operating project-financed infrastructure and continuing
project-financed activities. These will continue, albeit with even lower levels of drugs and supplies than
under the project.
Overall, the resource transfer to local governments under the project was not achieved on the
planned scale. As a result of devolution, the DOH now has only a very small budget for matching grant
finance to local governments. The ongoing health sector reform contains no special provision for
improving the health and nutrition of disadvantaged slum populations. Yet significant health problems
remain in the slumns, especially in the areas of protein-energy malnutrition and environmental health.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The project as identified was appropriate. Bank assistance in preparation was adequate on the
technical front, but the Bank missions were inadequately staffed with regard to institutional development,
procurement and financial management. Bank support was most unsatisfactory during the first four years
of implementation. The Task Manager (TM) changed immediately after appraisal, but there was no
hand-over mission with both old and new TM.
7.2 Supernision:
Supervision was weak immediately after the project became effective, just when a weak PMO most
needed help. The incoming TM proved unable to develop a cooperative working relationship with the
PMO. The Bank did not act quickly to recognize and resolve this problem. Nor, as the project's
performance deteriorated, did Bank management begin a high level dialogue with the Govemment to find
ways to improve it.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The Bank's performance improved from 1998, when supervision was handed over to the resident
mission, and a new TM developed a more productive working relationship, and assisted with the project
restructuring. By this time also, the resident mission had developed a capacity to assist the DOH with
training and technical assistance in the areas of procurement and financial management. This local
presence meant a quick tum-round time on procurement clearances, and continuing help in resolving
bottlenecks. But despite these improvements later in project implementation, overall Bank perfornance can
only be rated as unsatisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's comnuitment to the project during preparation was very satisfactory, in that there
was adequate attention from top DOH management, involvement of the relevant programs and services in
DOH, and participation of local governments.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
There was little or no support or effort from GOP oversight agencies to assist DOH in problem
solving despite its unsatisfhctory performance rating by the Bank. The lack of clear financial guidelines in
the MNunicipal De-vlloyment Fund (MDF), slowed SOE processing in Manila; MDF sometimes exercised an
audit rather than a review function with respect to SOEs.
- 10-



7.6 Implementing Agency:
As noted above, Implementing Agency performance improved substantially during the last two
years of implementation. However, in the earlier years of the project, a combination of the following
problems led to Bank supervision missions giving the project an unsatisfactory rating for three successive
years from 1996:
*      There was no continuity between the staff who helped prepare the project and those
recruited into the PMO for project implementation.
*      PMO staffing was slow and piecemeal, and late recruitment meant inadequate time for
team-building and training.
The PMO was not staffed with individuals who had experience in managing large scale
donor-funded projects.
*      The PMO tried too much to go it alone, rather than cooperating with the DOH program
and service departments, and seeking assistance from the PHDP PMO, which had much
experience in project procurement and financial management.
DOH was slow in redefining its new role after devolution, and in developing related
operational procedures under devolution, and this led to continuing uncertainty for both the
PMO and participating local governments.
There were very serious procurement delays, due to a procurement specialist not being
hired into the PMO until the fourth year of the project; lack of procurement planning and
implementation; difficulties in DOH preparing specifications and bid documents; long
delays in bid evaluation; lack of systematic procurement monitoring; lack of understanding
of Bank procurement procedures.
*      There were serious disbursement delays, due to lack of competent financial management
staff in the PMO (for the first two years of the project, its finances were managed by a
generalist project officer and a clerk); slow processing of statements of expenditure
(SOEs) by local governments whose financial management systems were weak, and whose
accountants often gave UHNP implementation low priority; lack of internal control and
record systems in the PMO, resulting in lack of clarity about what physical assets were
available, or what costs were incurred.
*      The project never developed effective financial management, procurement or progress
monitoring systems, and even basic office management and filing systems were inadequate
right from the early years of the project.
*      The frequent changes in Secretary led to inadequate supervision and support from DOH
management, and inadequate intervention when the project's performance deteriorated.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory overall. Nevertheless, it did far better in its last two
years than in its first four. Three factors were mainly responsible for this:
A competent, full time project manager was appointed during this period.
*      The project restructuring process helped the PMO to get some of the basic planning done
which should have been completed before project effectiveness.
Some progress was made in strengthening capacity and clarifying procedures in the
across-the-board problem areas of procurement, financial management, and reorientation
of DOH to its new post-devolution role.
The local governments involved do not consider UHNP to be a failure, but are frustrated that the
central government got the project moving only in its last two years, and that it ended before many of the
- 11 -



agreed inputs had reached them. About a third of the LGUs performed very well despite the failure of
DOH to deliver inputs in a timely manner.
8. Lessons Learned
(i)    Resolve Cross-Cutting and Fundamental Management Problems First. Persistent,
cross-cutting management problems, in areas such as those listed below, cannot be solved by traditional
lending operations on a project-by-project basis, and need separate reform efforts or projects focusing
solely on dealing with them such as weak financial management, procurement, and civil service.
(ii)  Identify and Respond to Major Changes Likely to Affecting the Implementing Agency. Bank
lending should respond adequately to major institutional changes affecting the implementing agency (such
as the advent of health sector devolution) at the design stage, and make a careful judgement whether a
traditional, service delivery-oriented project:
Should be postponed until conditions have stabilized and new systems have been
developed; or
Could be developed in parallel, with appropriate capacity building and reduced
complexity.
(iii)  Encourage Borrower to Develop and Maintain a Professional Project Management Office.
Professional staff, expert in various aspects of project management should be developed in implementing
agencies so that they gain adequate experience in project management, and can successfully handle a wide
variety of projects. The concept of a Unified Project Management Office currently being developed in the
DOH is certainly a step in the right direction. The appropriate incentives for such staff and employment
status are dealt with at present in such an ad hoc manner across Bank and other donor projects and within
and across government agencies as to warrant a full-fledged study and follow-up action.
(iv)   Create True Project Ownership. True project ownership should be observed in terms of a strong
demand to secure efficient and effective project implementation and an unwillingness to tolerate delays of
the magnitude that characterized the first four years of UHNP. Country specific and institution-specific
mechanisms must be identified and developed that will demand project implementation performance.
Examples include effective monitoring by Govemment oversight agencies; joint and in-depth monitoring by
donors and oversight agencies; civil society monitoring.
(v)    Bank Support
Change of task managers soon after project preparation, and that too, abruptly and without
immediate replacement and follow up should be avoided at all costs.
*      The Bank should provide an adequate amount of supervision in the crucial first project
year.
The Bank should intervene early on to replace ineffective Task Managers.

noting that the collaboration between WHO and the Bank resulted in positive outcomes in the last 2 years
of the project. Also worth-noting is that the budget for TB drugs increased to US$2 Million as against the
original estimate of US$ 0.7 million. The provision of TB drugs is crucial for the DOTS program in the
country, and the project team should be congratulated for augmenting the allocation during restructuring
and supporting the procurement of the drugs. (WHO Regional Office, Manila)

URBAN HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROJECT
1994-2001
BACKGROUND
The Urban Health and Nutrition Project (UHNP) is a seven -year project, which started in Aprill994
funded through a US$ 70 million IDA loan from the World Bank. It is being implemented by the
Department of Health (DOM) together with twenty one local government units (LGUs). At the wake of
rapid urbanization and rising urban poverty, the UHNP was designed to directly address poverty alleviation
through the improvement of the health and nutrition status of slum dwellers in urban communities in Metro
Manila, Metro Cebu and Cagayan de Oro. Co-financing was provided by the Australian government
through a US$ 3.1 million grant for the IEC component of the project.
Since UHNP was one of the first health project that was initiated under a fully devolved health service
delivery system, the project was also envisioned to build the capacity of the city and municipal governments
in planning, financial management and implementation of cost health and nutrition programs in slum areas.
The UHNlP was also expected to draw operational lessons that the DOH can use to firm up its health
policies and strategies for the urban poor. DOH led the project through a Project Management Office
(PMO) and a Steering Committee composed of representatives from the DILG, DBM, DOF and NEDA.
Funds for the LGUs are currently channeled through the Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) of
the Department of Finance (DOF).
The project, however, encountered management and procedural problems so that by the end of 1998, total
fund utilization was only 27% and there was poor physical achievement of its targets and objectives. The
- 24 -



DOH, World Bank mission team and   consultants provided a thorough analysis of the strength and
weaknesses of implementation and by early 1998, a catch up or revised plan was recommended. Thus,
project implementation seemed to be divided into two parts: 1994-1998 following its original project
design; and, 1999-2000, based on the revised plan.
ORIGINAL PLAN 1994-1998
A.     PROJECT DESIGN
As summarized in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) dated 14 May 1993, UHNP would directly address
poverty alleviation through four broad qualitative goals in the areas of health and nutrition impact,
institutional development, community self reliance, and policy research, as follows: (a) to improve the
health and nutrition status of slum dwellers in the urban areas of Metro Manila, Metro Cebu and Cagayan
de Oro; (b) to build the capacity of the city and municipal governments in these areas to plan, finance and
implement cost effective slum health and nutrition programs; (c) to help slum communities identify their
own health needs, nutrition and environmental problems and participate in planning, implementing and
monitoring appropriate interventions; and (d) to help the DOH develop policies and strategies which would
help improve the outreach and cost-effectiveness of health and nutrition delivery programs.
The project has 4 major components:
*      Service delivery: TB control, MCH, STD and family planning
*      Institutional Development: DOH and LGU wide management capability building
*      Community Partnership
*      Environmental Health Development
*      Policy Research and Evaluation.
Innovative health risk assessment, client targeting systems, training and communications methodologies,
improved staffing and facilities active community mobilization and partnerships and operations research on
service delivery models were expected to lead to improve overall cost effectiveness of priority health and
nutrition services. These models were expected to be replicated on a national scale and build DOH's
capacity to fulfill its new role under a decentralized health delivery system, that of providing support to the
local govemment units rather than actually managing the system.
B.     PROJECT GOALS, OBJECTIVESAND TARGETS
The following were the project's impact objectives : (1) Reduction of anernia among registered pregnant
women by 25%; (2) reduction of low birth weight among babies of registered mothers by 25%; (3)
reduction of the prevalence of underweight and stunting among registered 24 months old children by 25%;
(4) 100% elimination of deficient and low serum retinol levels among registered women and registered
0-24months old children; (5) reduction of anemia among registered 0-24 months old children by 25%; and
(6) reduction in the incidence of pneumonia in the 0-24 months children by 25%. The project had 2
outcome objectives, both of which are related to family planning: (1) reduction by half of the number of
deliveries within 2 years of the preceding one; and (2) increase in contraceptive prevalence rate among
project target women between 15-45 years of age from 20% to 45%.
Included in the list are 13 more process and outcome objectives directed to MCHN and TB control
- 25 -



programs plus 3 directed at health facilities.
C.     STRA TEGIES
To achieve its stated project goals, four main strategies were adopted, as follows:
*      Increase resource flows for primary health care and nutrition services in slums and target
these resources more tightly on priority interventions and clients;
*      Use training, technical assistance and selective financial support to strengthen the capacity
of city and municipal health offices in their new role after devolution to plan, manage,
finance and improve the quality of slum health and nutrition services;
*      Build on the experience of existing projects and programs, with mobilizing communities
through the development of community health partnership with local governments and
NGOs; and,
*      Finance research to test alternative strategies for service delivery in urban areas.
REVISED PLAN 1990-2001
A.     PROJECTDESIGN
The revised plan is not a full or total revision of the project since it continues to adhere to the basic
principles and long-term goals as defined in the original plan. It maintained the same components but
streamlined its focus:
*      Service delivery: TB control and MCHN
*      Institutional Development
*      Community Partnership
The revised plan is also more detailed in terms of implementation inputs, progress indicators and progress
management tools to ensure that the primary goals of the project are met, in the light of current political
and administrative changes as well as experiences and findings in the first 4 years. More importantly the
revised plan added these essential features: (a) greater focus on the urban poor communities through better
targeting; (b) streamlining of service delivery interventions to achieve impact in two key health concems:
TB and IMCH services; (c) comprehensive and sustained on-the-job-capacity building for local govemrnment
units; (d) simplified coordination, communication, financing and  project management system with
intensified involvement of regional field health units; and (e) limited, better defined and shorter duration
operational research sub projects.
B.     PROJECT GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS
The four broad qualitative goals of the project remain essentially the same. Although the overall impact
and outcome goals in the revised plan continue to be along the same directions as in the original project
design, the revision takes into account the inter-relatedness of the interventions that lead to the same levels
women and children is susLa,ied.
- 26 -



The revised objectives also incorporate modifications in strategies in both TB control and integrated MCH
programs. Unrealistic and politically unacceptable targets were deleted, among which are: reduction of
pneumonia incidence; increased contraceptive prevalence; and, elimination of deficient serum retinol levels.
C.     STRATEGIES
Taking into serious consideration the strategic gaps identified during the mid term review, the revised plan
redefine the project's strategies as follows:
*      Planning and managing health and nutrition services from the LGU perspective
*      Systematic introduction of changes in actual frontline service delivery at the health
center/stations and hospital;
*      Interactive "developmental" relationship between DOH and the LGU and between the
LGU and the client/community;
*      Data-based decision-action cycle
PROJECT COMPONENTS
TUBERCULOSIS
The component's objective based on the SAR is to "improve the outreach, range, quality and
cost-effectiveness of priority health and nutrition services, through improvements on health risk assessment
and client targeting systems, addition/improvements to health staffing and facilities and provision of
additional equipment, contraceptives, drugs and supplies and food and micronutrient supplements.
Specifically, based on the UHNP operations manual, the primary objective of this sub-component was to
reduce TB prevalence from an estimated 12.0 per thousand in 1990 to at least .46 in 1998. The program
coverage was targeted to be increased from 45% in 1990 to 70% in 1998. The main approach was
stratification based on population density. NTP activities such as case finding, deployment of case finding
package, defaulter follow-up and IEC were intended to vary depending on whether the population density of
the area is high, medium or low.
During the mid-term review the following weaknesses were found in the implementation of TB control
program in UHNP areas: (1) low positivity rate due to active case finding and targeting of TB
symptomatics; (2) low proportion of smear (+) cases among the total TB cases; (3) no standard reporting
and recording forms; (4) poor case holding; and, (5) lack of supervision. These weaknesses were
exacerbated by the UHNP's non-procurement of TB since 1994.
Learning from the findings of the mid-term, a change in approach and management set-up was
recommended as follows: (1) implement DOTS package in collaboration with DOH NTP and PMO; and
(2) change strategy and prograrn targets/indicators to conform with DOTS strategy.
Accordingly, objectives, targets and objectives were revised as follows:
*      Discover at least 65% of the estimated smear (+) positive cases
Cure at least 85% of those initiated treatment.
- 27 -



The following strategies were adopted to achieve these objectives:
      City-wide adoption of DOTS strategv- improved microscopy, availability of TB dhugs and
laboratory supplies, use of treatment partners, revised records and reports and political
will to advocate for more resources
*      Adoption of enhanced DOTS in urban areas-provision of intensive inputs, systematic
contact tracing among high risk families, collaboration with hospital staff and private
practitioners, organization of TB support group and conduct of commnunity health
education on TB.
At the end of project, the TB component proved to have the biggest gains among the Service Delivery
component. The expansion and consolidation of DOTS has continued to progress well, with the
constitution and functional diagnostic committees and improvement in validation of smear microscopy.
The 100,000 population. The smear positive case detection rate was 66 per 100,000 population which
surpassed the set target at 65% by CY 2001. The sputum conversion is 94.6% for patients whose smear
was examined at the end of the first two months of treatment and 77.1% for all patients due for smear
examination. However, despite improvement in almost all aspect of TB control implementation, the
treatment success rate is 80%, which is 5% short of the target.
In the last two years, perhaps the single most important factor that propelled TB control implementation is
the availability and adequacy of TB drugs and laboratory supplies in all project sites. The UIftNP was able
to procure and deliver TB drugs and supplies in CY 2000, which will provide the project areas with buffer
stock until CY 2002.
MA TERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH
The identification of MCH, nutrition and family planning services as essential sub-component of service
delivery to the urban poor was sound and astute. UHNP lined up a considerable number of input related to
matemal and child health programs including adequate support services such as construction of health
centers/other health facilities and hiring of contractual staff such as midwives, nurses and physicians.
However, during the mid-term review, it was found out that the past UHNP activities did not include an
active, systematic process of tailoring, integrating and "editing" nationally designed MCH interventions to
suit the needs and demands of the urban poor. Thus, instead of formulating a cohesive MCH/FP/nutrition
program that addresses the needs of the urban poor, nationally designed programs were borrowed and
replicated in total in the cities which resulted in haphazard mix of interventions. Coverage of health
services for the urban slums did not reach high enough proportions to significantly change health status in
these communities.
The same inputs and targets since the systems and procedures to institutionalize and standardize the
mechanisms to deliver inputs will basically be the same for the entire city and placed a heavy emphasis on
the intensity. In addition, some of the selected inputs were grouped together emphasizing that all of these
interventions have to be delivered together as a complete set of interventions in order to achieve desired
targets.
To achieve Integration of health services and information which was a vital overall strategy for improving
the health of the urban poor, services were delivered in the following forn:
- 28 -



*      Client based integration of curative services
*      Integration of curative and preventive interventions for high risk families
*      Integrated organization of health services.
At the end of the project, IMCH implementation has been satisfactory in terms of being able to provide the
planned input on training of health workers on various areas of IMCI and production/dissemination of IEC
materials. However, there is a mixed level of implementation among LGUs for the 13 performance
indicators prescribed by the project.
In the original plan, operations research was treated as a separate component. It was envisioned to test cost
effective altemative service delivery models for the urban poor. Aside from a baseline survey, annual and
mid-term evaluation, studies on workload and work routines, women's health, nutrition and community
environment improvement were supposed to have been conducted. In nutrition, the proposed studies were:
(1) organization of growth promotion; (2) development of altemative cost effective recipes for food
supplements; and. (3) iron supplementation of infants. Unfortunately, until the mid-term, none of these
proposals were completed for unclear reasons.
The revised plan continued to put big value in conducting operational and policy research in the areas of
nutrition and environmental health. After the mid-term, a better-defined Terms of Reference (TOR) and
limited scope wvas developed which enabled the UHNP PMO to conduct one operational research and one
process documentation in nutrition. This was made through a subcontract with experienced research group
and participated by the LGU staff and selected target communities.
A major support activity to the MCH component is civil works.    This activity proposed the
construction/renovation of 133 health facility infrastructure projects spread across the LGUs. It was hoped
that with better facilities nearer to the urban poor population, there will be greater and easier access to
basic services.
At the time of the mid term review, the civil works component was the only one on track. Maintaining the
same momentum throughout project life, the project was able to complete 126 out of the 133 proposed
facilities.
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
In the original project design, the Institutional Development component was expected to improve the
capacity of local govemment units to plan, monitor and evaluate their own health program and for the
DOH, under a devolved set up, provide support to LGUs through strengthening their own management
systems, planning and evaluation capability. It was also intended that training approaches would shift from
traditional approaches to needs based and to utilize modem technologies, particularly interactive multi
media. Customized training courses geared toward these objectives were to be developed.
By the time of the mid term this sub component hardly achieved its target and was beset by a lot of
problems.
At the DOH, the project management has been problematic from the outset. Many of the project's
implementation difficulties stemmed from these underlying causes: late start in staffing the PMO;
recruitment of inexperienced PMO staff in management resources outside of the PMO; and, lack of
specificationrguidelines in work programs, planning and management systems and operational procedures.

At the LGU level, the size, management capacity and experience in project management require appropriate
and well-defined assistance that the PMO was not able to adequately provide.
The revised plan for this component remained consistent with the original plan. However, the same
intensity is now given building both the DOH and LGUs capacity to understand and manage their
respective roles, functions and systems under a devolved health care delivery system..
Consistent with the revised plan, the UHNP PMO was streamlined, involved key DOH technical
programs/services for component strategy and monitoring, shift the locus of project implementation
responsibility to the LGUs and develop the capability of the regional offices to provide technical support to
the LGUs.
After the adoption of the revised plan, this component still took sometime to take off. In CY 2000, UHNP
contracted the UP-CPH which provided "off the shelves" training courses for 422 participants coming from
the LGUs, CHDs (formerly DOH Regional Offices) and DOH.    Five different courses on health
management were provided and attended by doctors, nurses, medical and non-medical health professionals.
In February 2001, the contract for UP CPH was extended to assist the former trainees in developing LGU
specific projects aimed at improving either the management of a service delivery program or a particular
system within the LGU. This was also completed despite the very limited time frame and even enabled
some of the LGUs and CHDs to undertake initial implementation. The practical application of the skills
leamed has been one of the highlights entire capacity building effort for the project.
The Information, Education and Communication (lEC) was also a sub component of Institutional
Development. This was funded separately through a grant from the Australian Agency for International
Development (AusAID). Starting in July 1994 and completed by 1999. The original objectives were to:
(1) strengthen the role of the Public Information and Health Education Service (PIHES) of the DOH; (2)
develop and implement a strategic IEC plan supportive of the project activities; and (3) institutionalize
regular qualitative monitoring and evaluation of the IEC activities.
The sub-component was able to accomplish its objectives though limited because in the 1995-96, the focus
was shifted from PIHES to the PMO to help support for the LGUs.
After the AusAid funding, the implementation of the IEC component was continued using WB funds. IEC
activities focused on targeting urban slum women and children, supporting the TB and IMCH through local
advocacy and develop LGU staff capability to run professional quality IEC campaigns and outreach
programs.
The IEC sub component was able to achieve its target by end of the project. It was able to formulate
monitoring and evaluation tools to measure effectiveness of IEC campaign.  The highlight of its
implementation rests in the highly trained Health Education and Promotion Officers (HEPOs) working
among LGUs.
COMMUNITYPARTNERSIfP
In the original UHNP Plan, the community partnership component was subsumed under the Environmental
Health Development (EHD). It aimed to assist target communities identify their own health, nutrition and
environmental problems and participate in planning, implementing and monitoring appropriate
- 30 -



interventions. Guidelines were developed incorporating the procedures and requirements for identifying and
selecting communities and NGOs that can partner with the LGUs in planning, organizing, budgeting and
installing the appropriate environmental facilities and services.
While this component was satisfactorily implemented at the start of the project, with encouraging
participation of the stakeholders, it slowed down as it entered the sub project development stage and
encountered problems which severely affected implementation: lack of expertise at the LGU level to
develop qualified proposals; prolonged review process from the LGU to DOH regional offices and UHNP
PMO; liquidation and disbursement problems; and, lack of project sustainability.
The revised plan essentially pursued the same objectives outlined in the original plan but introduced a
major change in strategy which was the engagement of an Apex NGO to address the difficulties
encountered in the preparation of sub project proposals as well as financial supervision and accountability.
Included in the plan were the bigger and strengthened roles of the DOH regional offices in and supervising
activities under this component.
In CY 2000, the UHNP PMO engaged the services of PHILSSA as an apex or service NGO which fulfilled
the role outlined in the revised plan and even added provision of technical assistance and capability building
activities based on the demand of communities. As plans for implementation were being finalized, a better
mode of managing the component emerged. The engagement of the service NGO was twined with the
engagement of convenor NGO at the LGU level. Adding value to the process was the active participation
of the LGU/community in the selection of the NGO partner that bonded the partnership. The contracting of
the service NGO resulted in quick delivery of output for the CPH component. Although there was initial
delay in processing of the PHILSSA contract and in the release of funds, PHtLSSA was able to facilitate
the development of sub projects, conduct capacity building training courses tailor fitted to conimunity
groups, develop and utilize training manuals for the review and screening of sub proposals. More
importantly, the implementation arrangement was heavily supported by an appropriately designed
organizational structure involving DOH (CO and CHDs), PHILSSA and representatives from convenor
NGO groups. In terms of actual accomplishment, the component was able to implement 11 sub project
grants from 1994-1999 compared to 59 sub projects implemented from 2000 -2001.
FACTORS AFFECTING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Design and Planning
It was clear that the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) preparation took into consideration the new devolved set
up of the health care delivery system brought about by the enactment of the Local Government Code in
1991 and became effective in 1993. A considerable consultations and planning sessions with the target
LGUs featured broad goals, direction plans and generic project activities which the UHNP PMO failed to
translate into realistic and operational plans and guidelines.
Implementation
Management
From 1994 to 2001, the UHNP has been through 7 Secretaries of Health, 2 national and 2 local elections
and 1 national upheaval (EDSA 2). This has greatly impact on project implementation with changes in
leadership inevitably brought about changes in policies. At the project level, the same fast turnover of
administration and personnel occurred both at the PMO and the LGU. At the UHNP PMO, the project had
- 31 -



4 project coordinators.
Until the mid-term review, project management has been identified as the single most important reason for
the poor performance of the project. The problems identified were: (1) lack of system of accountabilities,
attendant authority and consequences for non-performance; (2) poor leadership and lack of direction; (3)
absence of effective management systems; and, (4) poorly defined and developed capabilities to execute job
functions.
In response to the problems identified, the UHNP PMO was streamlined, stronger coordination with other
DOH offices were made to maximize utilization of technical and management resources outside of the
UHNP PMO and shifted the locus of project implementation to LGUs.
In CY 2000, project implementation made significant progress. On the side of the DOH, the project was
given the long sought after attention from the DOH management. The timely organization of the Unified
Project Management Office (UPMO) brought about by the recent DOH reengineering provided the UHNP
full support to achieve target set for the remaining project life. The UHNP PMO's DOH offices and the
CHDs also contributed a lot to progress in implementation. The CHDs took the responsibility of
monitoring, supervision and mentoring the project components. On the other hand, the DOH technical
programs/services provided technical guidance in selecting national program activities that can be ably
supported by the project.
*:     Operations
The two most prominent support activities that cut across all components are financial management and
procurement.
In the original UHNP plan, the PMO would consolidate all the project plans and budget of the individual
LGUs, the DOH central and regional offices. The consolidated project budget would become a line item in
the DOF- MDFO budget. Once appropriated funds will be released following 2 tracks: project funds to be
disbursed by DOH (central and regional) would be released through the established Advice of
Allotment/Notice of Cash Allocation procedures; and, project funds to be disbursed by LGUs would be
released without passing through the DOH, via the MDF administered DOF through the Bureau of
Treasury.
In 1994, this type of financial arrangement was something new both for the DOH and LGUs. For the
LGUs, the mix of unfamiliarity with FM procedures of national agencies such as DOF and varied FM
system design followed by individual LGUs severely hampered project implementation and disbursement.
This was not properly addressed because of the PMO's own lack of adequate capacity for financial
management. Thus, these have resulted in major gaps in the project's FM system that in turn have
contributed to the observed weakness in project management. Inadequate and unqualified staff were
assigned to handle these as well. In the early years of the project, the project's FM system was not
integrated with the DOH's financial management system. On the other hand, the project is of the
impression that MDFO itself is still trying to firm up its own financial management system. These again
delayed project implementation and disbursement.
Towards the end, the project showed remarked improvement in project disbursement both for the PMO and
LGUs. These were attributed to tighter monitoring and supervision of the PMO with the LGUs, clearer
and simpler reporting guidelines and format, and stronger coordination with MDFO.

Procurement bottlenecks remain the primary reason for the inability of the PMO to provide the project with
drugs and medicine, equipment and furniture in a timely and rational manner. This can be attributed to the
following: (1) bottlenecks and delays in DOH internal procurement system; (2) DOH and UHNP's PMO's
lack of understanding and non-familiarity with the Bank's procedure; and until 1997 (3) delays in
processing Bank responses.
Beginning 1998 a procurement reforms were introduced in an effort to solve the long standing problems. A
Procurement Reform Team under the Office of the Secretary of Health was constituted to closely monitor
all on going and pipeline procurement packages. A large number of UHNP procurement was processed
during this period.
While the advances on the DOH procurement reforms are now being continued by the new leadership in
DOH, difficulties in procurement are recurring because of some changes in some DOH offices mainly
involved in the procurement process.
LGU Response
UHNP's project preparation and planning started in 1988 when most of the LGU partner were newly
integrated with Metro Manila and the health care delivery service still centrally implemented by the
Department of Health. Large planning conferences and consultations were held to gather needs, problems,
gaps as well as vision of the LGU partners. These were all taken into consideration and incorporated in the
UHNP design.
However, UHNP's effectivity was also timed with the recent passing of the Local Government Code of
1991 which definitely altered the delivery of health care services. The LGUs much like the DOH were still
trying to define new roles and responsibilities brought by the changes. Unfortunately the UHNP PMO was
also not prepared to provide management and technical support and assistance to the LGUs.
Nonetheless, the LGUs were able to leam their lessons and now had a greater understanding and
appreciation of their role in the health care delivery system. They are now better prepared to undertake
projects such as UHNP.
World Bank
The UHNP is a DOH project assisted by the World Bank. As mentioned in the section on Project Design,
the preparation of the SAR for UHNP was undertaken with the leadership and guidance of the WB
consultants assigned to the task. However, after the project has been approved and became effective,
review of records and events showed that the Bank did not send any supervision mission on the first 18
months of the project. Also, two Task Managers were said to be briefly assigned during that same period
but failed to make contact with the UHIINP PMO. After which, a new Task Manager was named and begun
to supervise the project from Washington D.C.
However, after the mid term, coordination and management from the Bank side improved through the
assignment of a permanent Task Manager based in the Resident Mission in Manila. At the same time, the
PMO developed a stronger coordination with other WB staff particularly the Procurement Specialist which
largely helped particularly in threshing out common implementation issues and concerns.
