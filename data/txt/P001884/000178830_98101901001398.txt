MAURITIUS
APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMIARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a first education project in Mauritius for
which an IDA credit and a Bank loan of US$3.5 million respectively are pro-
posed.
ii.       The Mauritian education sector has special quantitative and quali-
tative features. Quantitatively, enrollments at the primary school level
encompass 96% of the relevant age group with a high 31% at the secondary
level; at both levels there are high progression and low drop-out and repeti-
tion rates. Qualitatively the sector suffers from the effects of a very
rapid and unplanned expansion, most of which has occurred in private schools
where 95% of secondary students are enrolled.   The private schools operate
principally as entrepreneurial ventures and, for financial reasons, limit
teaching to literary subjects. Consequently, many graduates are ill-prepared
for employment opportunities in commerce and industry, the most dynamic sec-
tors of the economy.
iii.      The Government is pursuing an active policy of developing an export-
oriented labor intensive industry. Tn sunport of this policy, an Industrial
Estate has been established and an IDA project is assisting development
of a second estate. Special steps to attract an inflow of private capital
to support development of the estates have met with encouraging responses, and
in further support of these positive factors, an adequate flow of suitably
educated and trained manpower from the education sector into commerce and
industry is essential. Government therefore plans an expansion and re-orienta-
tion of the sector in accordance with these needs.
iv.       Apart from significant on-the-job training, the chief source of train-
ed manpower to support industrial development is from the UNDP/ILO assisted
Industrial Trade Training Center which, although competently operated, is too
small to supply industry's needs; therefore, a second center is planned to
help alleviate the shortage of craftsmen. A further step to provide training
for industry includes modernization of the secondary schools' curriculum so
as to focus on scientific and practical subjects. A survey of private secondary
schools has indicated the impracticability of providing each school with work-
shops, laboratories and equipment for relevant teaching; accordingly, it is
planned to construct laboratory and workshop centers strategically sited so
that each would service a cluster of secondary schools in an efficient and
economical manner. Simultaneously, a greater control of private schools,
replacement of the poorer ones and their gradual takeover by Government is
envisaged, and a detailed plan is expected to be prepared by a commission
now studying the problem.



v.        As a first step towards replacing ineffective private schools, early
construction of a limited number of lower secondary schools is required. They
would be sited in rural areas where educational opportunities at this level
are minimal and where special emphasis would be accorded to their development
so as to prepare graduates for expected employment opportunities.
vi.       In further support of the long-term strategy for development out-
lined in the Development Plan of Mauritius, in which unemployment is listed
as the most critical problem of the economy, Rural Education Centers are to be
established adjacent to selected primary schools. They would provide short
intensive agricultural and rural craft courses for adults and young people
and would particularly assist Government's agricultural diversification
policy and prepare school leavers for self-employment in farming.
vii.      The proposed project would provide major assistance to implement
the Development Plan's strategies by (a) broadening the secondary schools
curricula; (b) strengthening academic and administrative control by Govern-
ment over the private education sector particularly at the secondary level;
(c) expansion of trade training with the view to meeting demand for skilled
manpower; and (d) supporting rural and agricultural education and training.
It would provide:
(i) Construction, furniture and equipment for:
-    six new Laboratory and Workshop Centers with
a total capacity of 2,300 student places to be
used jointly by a number of existing private
secondary schools enrolling about 10,000 students
in science and practical subjects;
-    Six new lower secondary schools for a total
of 3,300 student places;
-    one new Industrial Trade Training Center with
a capacity of 200 student places;
-    five new Rural Education Centers attached to
existing primary schools and each with an
additional capacity of 80 student places;
(ii) 18 man-years of technical assistance and 5 man-years
of fellowships for development of the Industrial
Trade Training Center, and the Program Implementation
Unit (PIU).
The total number of student places provided and/or improved under the project
would be about 13,900.



- iii -
viii.     For project implementation, a PIU would be established within the
Ministry of Education for which provision for 7 man-years of technical
assistance is included in the proposed project. Because the Ministry
of Works is inadequately staffed to execute the volume of work in the pro-
posed project, a firm of consultants, mutually acceptable to the Government
and the Bank Group, would be appointed to execute designs and prepare con-
tract documents. Because the local building industry is working to capacity,
contractors are unlikely to bid at reasonable prices for execution of the
civil works included in the proposed project. Accordingly, the most expedi-
tious procedure would be for the PIU, in conjunction with the consultants, to
negotiate civil works contracts with the Development Works Corporation. 1/
Building materials for use in the contracts would be procured by bulk purchase
in accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines for international competitive
bidding. Contracts for furniture, and instructional equipment would be
similarly awarded; those below US$50,000 equivalent would not require Bank
Group approval before award. Preferred domestic manufacturers of equipment
would be awarded a margin of preference equivalent to the existing customs
duties applicable to competing imports or 15% of the c.i.f. price, whichever
is lower.
ix.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$11.6 million,
corresponding to US$11.2 million net of taxes, with a foreign exchange com-
ponent of US$7.4 million equivalent or 64% of the total project cost. This
high percentage is the result of a high proportion of imported equipment
required for the project schools and also because most building materials
are imported. The proposed IDA credit and Bank loan each of US$3.5 million
would correspond to nearly 63% of total project costs net of taxes and duties.
The project would be completed in approximately five years.
x.        The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit
and a Bank loan of US$3.5 million equivalent each.
1/  DWC is a corporate body established in 1970;its current activities
cover labor-intensive construction projects of primary schools, roads,
village halls, fodder plantations and afforestation. It performs an
important role in implementation of Rural Development Project under
Credit 419-MAS.






REPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS
APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Mauritius is a small volcanic island in the Indian Ocean, lying
about 500 miles east of Madagascar. More than half of its 826,000 inhabitants
are Hindus of Indian origin; other groups include Franco Mauritians and Creoles
(30%), Moslems of Indo-Pakistani extraction (16%), and Chinese descent (3%).
Bank Group operations in Mauritius are designed to assist the country's develop-
ment policy to expand manufacturing by utilizing its highly literate and adapt-
able labor force and to improve economic and social conditions of those living
on the land through rural development programs. The implementation of these
economic and social policies requires the reorientation of education and train-
ing. To this end, the Government has undertaken a critical examination of the
sector and developed a long-term plan for educational reform which was reviewed
by a Bank Group mission in 1973.
1.02      The proposed education project would represent a major contribution
to the plan. In particular, the project would: (a) broaden and realign the
content of education to meet urgent manpower needs; (b) equalize educational
opportunities between economic groups; and (c) increase utilization and effec-
tiveness of existing physical and human resources at the disposal of the sector.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US11.6 million equivalent and the
proposed Bank Group assistance of US$7.0 million equivalent would meet about 95%
of the foreign exchange costs.
1.03      The project was prepared and appraised by a mission which visited
Mauritius in November/December 1973; the mission consisted of Messrs. T.
Terrefe (education planner), C. Hammerschmidt (architect) and G. Rossel
(economist).
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND MANPOWER NEEDS
2.01      The Economic Background.  After two decades of virtual economic
stagnation, Mauritius has been experiencing a period of rapid economic growth
which has been mainly fostered by exogenous factors: favorable climatic
conditions and the comparatively high world demand for, and increased prices
of, sugar. GDP has increased at about 7% p.a. in real terms during the last
three years and a process of diversification of the economic structure has
started. However, because of 20 years of little or no growth, poverty and
unemployment are still the major problems. GDP per capita in real terms
which declined during the 1960's, when increases in output lagged behind



- 2 -
population growth, is now estimated at about US$280, but 17% of the labor
force is unemployed (Annexes 2 and 3) and 20% of the population have an
annual household income below the minimum level of US$250 equivalent
necessary for family subsistence under Mauritian conditions.
2.02      Development Objectives.  The long-term strategy for development is
outlined in the Development Plan 1971-75 which recognizes unemployment as the
most critical problem of the economy, and sets as its primary objective the
creation of jobs. To this end, the plan gives priority to expansion of
manufacturing, diversification of agriculture and promotion of tourism and
aims at increasing the manufacturing industry's contribution to GDP from 15%
in 1969 to 23% in 1980. Tourism's share in national output, insignificant at
the beginning of this decade, is expected to reach 3% in 1980.
2.03      In the manufacturing sector, Mauritius intends to follow the growth
pattern set by Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan and to make use of its abundant
and adaptable manpower resources. A scheme specifically aimed at stimulating
investment in export industries was put into effect in 1970 when the Export
Processing Act was approved. Under it, a number of tax incentives and con-
cessions are provided to attract private foreign capital. As a part of its
industrial policy, the Government reviews companies requesting these conces-
sions to insure that their labor intensity is appropriate to the country's
employment creation objectives. These measures have already borne fruit:
the export processing industries, where imported raw materials and semi-
finished goods are treated for re-export, employ 7,000 workers and a further
26,000 are expected to be employed by 1980.
2.04      Although the Plan calls for a decline in agriculture's share of GDP,
this is to be accomplished without a decrease in agricultural output. With
the exception of the sugar estates, agricultural productivity is low and the
scarcity of arable land is a major constraint to significant expansion and
diversification. To assist improved productivity and increased incomes for
small farmers, the Government has undertaken a rural development program with
IDA assistance which calls for bench terracing to increase land availability
for vegetable production. In addition, family size livestock and dairy farming
are being assisted.
2.05      Although over 48,500 tourists arrived in Mauritius in 1972, the
island's tourism potential is still largely untapped.  The number of hotel
rooms is expected to double from about 800 to 1,600 in the period 1970-75
and the Government plans to provide the necessary infrastructure (roads,
electricity, water supply and sewerage) and trained personnel for their
efficient operation and maintenance.
2.06      Recent developments towards these economic objectives are encouraging.
Over 22,000 permanent jobs have been created during the last three years in



large establishments alone. 1/ The expansion of the economy has taken place
throughout the sectors and structural diversification is well underway. In
1970-72, the sugar industry contributed one-fifth of the overall growth of
GDP already indicating a lower dependence of the economy on this sector. Be-
cause of these developments, the lack of trained manpower is a constraint on
the implementation of projects included in the Plan.
2.07      Manpower Requirements.  The weakness of the education and training
sector is one of the main constraints on the long-term development strategy
summarized in paras 2.02-2.05. In spite of the large number of unemployed
workers, serious high and middle-level manpower shortages exist, especially
in manufacturing, construction, trade, and transportation.
2.08      The June 1972 census has served as a basis for assessing the man-
power situation in some detail. Of the 495,000 people aged 15 and over, some
254,000 (or 50%) constituted a highly literate (77%), bilingual and adapt-
able labor force. Of the 204,000 males in the labor force, 169,000 (or 83%)
were employed of which about 19,000 were in temporary relief work. Of the
50,000 women in the labor force, 43,000 (or 86%) were employed. Hence, a
total of 45,000 persons were unemployed. 2/ Of this total, about 67% have
primary education or less, 33% have at least some secondary education and
a negligible 0.2% have attended post secondary institutions (Annex 3). The
Govermnent is taking a number of measures both to alleviate unemployment and
poverty in the shortest possible time, and to attain the technical and mana-
gerial capability to implement the plan of structural transformation out-
lined in paras 2.03-2.06. These measures include a massive public works
program under the Development Works Corporation (DWC).
2.09      During 1972-80 a total of about 87,400 new jobs (Annexes 4 and 5)
are expected to be created on the assumption that GDP will increase at 5.3%
p.a. in constant terms and productivity at some 1.0% p.a. Total employment
in 1980 is estimated to reach about 302,000 compared to a total labor force
of 325,000. The unemployment rate is, therefore, expected to decrease from
17% in 1972 to about 7% in 1980. These trends indicate that Mauritius could
become a full employment economy by the early eighties. The sectoral composi-
tion of the labor force in 1972 and the additional manpower requirements by
sector and level of education for the period 1972-1980 are summarized below:
1/ Large establishments include sugar plantations of 25 arpents (26 acres)
or more, tea plantations of 5 arpents or more, all tobacco plantations
irrespective of acreage, non-agricultural establishments employing at
least 10 persons and all central and local government.
2/ Including 3,000 persons aged 12-14 classified as economically active in
the census.

The above figures indicate a need for an average annual output of about 700
graduates at university level and 7,000 at secondary level as compared with
the present respective outputs of 140 and 8,000.
2.10      Although the above figures indicate a net surplus of 1,000 secondary
school graduates per year, this surplus is caused by a lack of balance between
graduates in arts and sciences; because only about 2% of graduates have read
science, there is a net serious shortage of these graduates. Further, the
quality of 75% of secondary school graduates, for reasons discussed in Chapter
3, is well below required standards. Consequently, output to meet require-
ments for middle level manpower with scientific and practical background is
under 300 p.a. as compared with a need for about 3,000 p.a.
2.11      During 1972-80, new job opportunities requiring only primary educa-
tion would number some 26,000 (para 2.09) as compared with about 50,000 who
enter the labor market either directly from primary schools or from sub-standard
sec-ondary schools. Vocational training programs especially directed to this
population group should therefore be expanded to assist their absorption as
skilled workers in industry or their development as small-holders within the
context of the agricultural development policy (para. 2.04).

3.01      Evaluation of the Sector.  The Mauritian education and training sec-
tor is described in Appendix 1 and the basic data are given in Annexes 6 and
7, and Charts 1 and 2. In summary, the system comprises a six-year primary
cycle followed by five- or seven-year secondary courses leading to the Cambridge
School and Higher School Certificates, respectively. University courses of
various durations both full and part-time are provided. The main strengths of
the system are: (a) high enrollment ratios at primary and secondary levels;
(b) high progression, low drop-out and repetition rates; and (c) a small but
rapidly developing scheme for training in industrial skills, together with
programs for training young farmers and encouraging development of agricul-
tural cooperatives.
3.02      The sector, however, suffers from major weaknesses adversely
affecting its capability to meet urgent manpower requirements and long-term
socio-economic needs. The imbalances between the sector outputs and labor'
market needs, discussed in paras. 2.07-2.11 result from the following principal
factors: (a) the Government academic and administrative control over private
schools, representing 30% of the primary enrollment and nearly 95% of the
secondary enrollment, is almost non-existent and most of the private schools
are purely commercial ventures of doubtful educational standards; (b) the
theoretical emphasis of examinations 1/ has a negative impact on content and
methods of instruction, as emphasis is placed on memorization and rote learning
rather than on the development of the students' attitudes and skills; (c) the
overly literary curricula, originally designed to prepare a selected minority
towards careers with the civil service, are no longer in harmony with the needs
of an expanding economy in process of structural transformation; and (d) faci-
lities for the teaching of practical subjects and science are lacking as
indicated by the fact that, at the secondary level, only 2% of the students
have access to science and prevocational courses.
3.03      Mauritius has virtually achieved universal primary education and
the curriculum has recently undergone some changes in the social studies
and elementary sciences to bring it more in line with the local context and
modern educational concepts. The dearth of facilities is a major problem of
primary education. As much as one-fourth of the enrollment in Government
primary schools is in rented premises and over one-third is on a double-shift
basis. For these students, school attendance is compacted into three-and-
a-half hours a day and the curriculum cannot be fully covered. Therefore,
in order to prepare for the secondary school entrance examination a system
of high priced private coaching has arisen which severely discriminates
against families from lower income groups. Finally, although the Teacher
Training College can meet the quantitative needs for teachers, primary
teacher training is mainly academic and takes little or no account of the
role future teachers are expected to play in community development.
1/   Examinations are prepared and corrected in the UK; an examination
syndicate, to develop examinations related to the country's needs
and environment, has been established within the newly created
Institute of Education.



-6-
3.04      Mauritius has only four good quality secondary schools (Port Louis,
Curepipe and two at Rose Hill), all Government operated; they can admit barely
2% of primary school leavers, hence there is keen competition for places.
Candidates failing this competitive examination have recourse to private
secondary schools where fees are four times those of Government schools and
enrollments about 49,000 as compared with 3,000 in Government schools. A
small minority (less than 1%) find places in Government lower secondary
schools to learn woodwork, metalwork, elements of agriculture and/or home
economics. Altogether, about 50% of the primary school leavers pursue general
secondary courses; the others try to seek admission to programs, such as
Youth Training Farms and the Industrial Trade Training Center (ITTC), or
join the labor market if their age permits. 1/ Applications for entrance
to these programs and to Government lower secondary schools are about seven
times the places available.
3.05      As indicated in para 3.02, the central problem of secondary education
is the lack of effective administrative and academic control over the private
sector. In turn, this is the consequence of a very rapid expansion: total
secondary school enrollment is now over 53,000 compared with less than 6,000
in 1947. Because of the predominance of the private sector, attempts to intro-
duce improved curricula and teaching methods have been, by and large, unsuc-
cessful in spite of the considerable progress made in developing a well-balanced
curriculum including practical subjects and science. The quality in the
majority of private schools is so meager that less than 2,000 or 20% of those
who graduate every year from Form V (grade 11) achieve satisfactory standards
required to enter post-secondary education or possess marketable skills.
Consequently, the inadequacies of secondary education also have a regressive
effect on social mobility.
3.06      Whilst over 30% of the relevant age group is enrolled in secondary
education, the corresponding ratio in higher education is barely 1.5% because
the University of Mauritius is in its infancy (Annex 7). A significant feature
is that the University provides special part-time programs to persons already
in employment which are often conducted in collaboration with the employers
and designed for specific needs; further, the beneficiaries (both employers and
employees) contribute significantly to the cost of these programs. Non-formal
education comprises craft training in skills for primary school leavers and
includes Youth Training Farms and the ITTC which is linked with an apprentice-
ship scheme. Specialized education is described in Appendix 1, para 11.
3.07      Policy, Strategy and Plans for Education Development.  The Government
has defined the following policy objectives (i) equality of educational op-
portunity for all according to their educational potential; (ii) free educa-
tion at the first level (primary school); (iii) opportunity for secondary educa-
tion or vocational training for 60% of the 15-19 age group by 1980; and (iv)
balanced curricula which would include practical subjects and integrated

allows apprenticeship from the age of 15.



-7-
science at all levels. In the area of non-formal education and training, the
Government intends to (i) develop a scheme of rural education for youth and
adults which would complement and assist plans for diversification of agricul-
ture (para 2.04); and (ii) integrate formal and non-formal education in urban
areas, mainly by eliminating the rigidities of the present examination system
and expanding skill training and apprenticeship. The strategy to meet these
objectives calls for improvement at various education levels and places
emphasis on reorienting the system before providing for major additions or
expansions. The main feature of this strategy is the planned reform of the
examination system to replace the presently external examinations with tests
more relevant to prevailing and future conditions. To increase control on,
and improve the quality of private schools, the Goverment envisages gradually
increasing assistance and services to such schools and at the same time, ex-
panding the number of public schools. To develop better learning networks
for youth and adults in rural areas, it is proposed not only to expand specific
schemes but also to place the human resources employed in the education
sector, particularly primary school teachers, at the disposal of the community
development programs.
3.08      Plans have been drawn up for various levels and types of education.
In order to alleviate unemployment, improvement of physical facilities in
primary education (para 3.03) will be carried out by the DWC (para 2.08).
The aim is to replace rented premises and reduce double-shift workings. To
obtain full benefit from the proposed improvement in accommodations, an Insti-
tute of Education (Appendix 2) has been created to reform examinations,
curricula and teaching methods and the programs of studies in primary teacher
training would be changed to place more emphasis on professional subjects,
practice teaching and elementary-applied science such as nutrition and simple
agriculture.
3.09      The Institute of Education would also constitute the focus for reforms
in secondary education. In addition to providing pre-service and in-service
training for secondary school teachers and other education personnel, the
Institute would develop syllabi and coordinate and guide the introduction of
practical subjects and modern audio-visual aids. To ensure the gradual
application of the new programs throughout the secondary schools, Government
plans call for (a) the establishment of a secondary school inspectorate,
(b) a gradual expansion of enrollment in Government secondary schools and
(c) the provision of centralized laboratories and workshops for the teaching
of science and practical subjects in private schools. In particular, the
proportion of secondary enrollment in Government schools would increase from
6% in 1972 to 14% in 1980; specifically, six new lower secondary schools
(grades 7-10) would be established as a part of the proposed project and
upper secondary education is expected to be assisted by FED (Appendix 1,
paras 18-21). A special commission, the Ramphul Commission, has been estab-
lished to review private education, set criteria and standards for private
schools and to review the fees presently charged. The Commission's preliminary
recommendations favor (i) improving the physical facilities of private schools



-8-
so that they could broaden their curricula; (ii) subsidizing teaching posts;
and (iii) equalizing fees in both Government and private schools. It is also
likely that the Commission will recommend the closing of a number of unsuitable
priva_.e schools and their replacement by Government schools.  During negotia-
tions, the Government confirmed its intention to exchange views with the
Bank Group on the findings of the Ramphul Commission and on the measures
envisaged for implementing its recommendations.
3.10      As emphasis is on reorganization, measures will be taken to control
enrollment growth in order to attune quantitative outputs with estimated
manpower needs (para 2.09): while secondary school enrollment has grown by
over 7% p.a. from 1968 to 1973, future increases are expected not to exceed
3% p.a. (Annex 8) as an increasing number of students would be directed toward
trade training and rural education rather than to secondary schools. At the
same time, the proportion of secondary enrollment taking technical, agricul-
tural and commercial courses would increase from less than 2% in 1972 to some
10% in 1985; about 70% of such an increase would be due to the centralized
laboratories and workshops for existing private schools to be established
as a part of the proposed project.
3.11      At the post-secondary level, Mauritius would give priority to the
development of the University where total enrollment is planned to reach 2,000
by 1980, a size which would meet minimum estimates of manpower requirements
(paras 2.09 - 2.10); expansion would take place principally in the disciplines
of public and business administration, agriculture, public health and industrial
technology, including food technology.
3.12      In order to enhance non-formal training for industry an institute
for entrepreneurship training would be created to provide managerial skills
for small-scale industries and, as part of the proposed project, a second
ITTC would be developed. These developments would be closely coordinated
with industry.
3.13      Plans for education for rural development include the strengthening
of existing Youth Training Farms and Youth Training Centers which would also
be open to adult farmers and farming families; such strengthening would be
achieved through the Rural Education Centers (REC's) included in the proposed
project. Further, a mobile health education scheme would assist improvement
in nutrition and preventive care knowledge of the farming population and,
the reorientation of primary teacher training (para 3.08) would facilitate
the implementation of community development programs. Finally, as a part of
the secondary school reform, the Government plans that secondary schools in
rural areas would place emphasis on agriculture as a practical subject while
those in towns would give priority to industrial arts; schools would be built
and/or remodelled to meet these needs.

Financing Educational Development
3.14      Educational institutions in Mauritius are classified into:  (i) those
financed by the Ministry of Education budget; (ii) those financed by other
Ministries; (iii) those financed by the private sector with assistance from
the Ministry of Education; and (iv) those financed entirely by the private
sector. Details of the system of educational finances are given in Appendix 1,
paras 34-41 and Annexes 9 and 10. Total education expenditure has increased
by 8% p.a. in monetary terms over the last seven years and in 1972-73 is esti-
mated at Mau Rs 69.5 million or 4% of GDP. Public expenditure on education
is equivalent to 11.7% of total public expenditures and Government recurrent
expenditure on education is 14.6% of total public recurrent expenditure (Annexes
9 and 10). These percentages are low when compared with other countries with
similar levels of development.
3.15      Projected public expenditures in education are summarized below:
(Mau Rs million)
1974-75    1979-80    1984-85
Recurrent Expenditures                74.4        109.3      160.6
Capital Expenditures                   9.4          2.2       n.a.
Total                            83.8       111.5       160.6
No estimates of capital expenditures are available beyond 1980.  Private ex-
penditures are projected to reach Mau Rs 20.0 million by 1984-85.  Although
projections beyond 1980 are tentative, the projections show that the share
of public education expenditure in GNP would increase to 4.3% in 1980 and
4.8% by 1985. These ratios are reasonable and compare as follows with other
countries of a per capita income of about US$300 equivalent:
Congo (B)         Liberia        Zambia
(1970)          (1970)         (1971)
5.8             3.7            5.6
3.16      Investment in education will require substantial foreign assistance.
Of a total of Mau Rs 105 million required to finance the completion of
on-going and new projects, about Mau Rs 65 million (or 62%) would be
foreign assistance. Anticipated sources of the foreign assistance for
capital expenditures are summarized in Annex 11.

IV. THE PROJECT
Objectives
4.01      The proposed project would assist the Government's educational
strategy (para 3.07) by supporting the following: (a) broadening the secon-
dary school curricula; (b) strengthening academic and administrative control
over the private education sector; (c) expanding industrial training; and
(d) supporting rural education and training. It would consist of:
(i) construction, furnishing and equipping of new institutions:
Approximate
No. of Student Places
Type of Institutions                      Total       Additional

be used in common by private
schools                              10,000         2,300

Total                               13,900        6,200
(ii) the cost of 18 man-years of specialists' services and 5 man-years
of fellowships for the initial staff for ITTC, and the Program
Implementation Unit (PIU);
The total number of student places improved and/or provided under the project
would be approximately 13,900, of which 13,300 would be in secondary schools.
Thus, the project would provide improved facilities for about 20% of the 1980
total enrollment in secondary schools, but, because emphasis is on reorgani-
zation and introduction of new curricula rather than on expansion, the addi-
tional student places created under the project would meet only 24% of the



- 1 1 -
expected growth of secondary education. At the same time, the project would
double the capacity in skill training and provide for a 150% expansion of
non-formal education for rural development.
Project Items
4.02      Laboratory and Workshop Centers. (LWCs)  In accordance with the
preliminary findings of the Ramphul Commission (para. 3.09), the provision of
LWCs would assist in (i) strengthening Government academic and administrative
control over private schools; (ii) introducing prevocational subjects (indus-
trial arts, commerce and home economics) in the programs of such schools;
(iii) achieving economies on the utilization of teachers of science and in-
structors of practical subjects. The six LWCs would service some 80 private
schools enabling about 10,000 students in Forms III-V to use the science
laboratories and workshops. The Government is considering the feasibility
of charging fees to the private schools for the use of these facilities.
4.03      The teachers of science and instructors of practical subjects re-
quired to staff the LWCs would be trained at the Institute of Education
(para 3.09) through in-service and pre-service courses (Appendix 2). Educa-
tional administrative personnel needed to strengthen supervision and control
of the private schools would also be trained in the Institute. During nego-
tiations, the Government confirmed its intention to exchange views with the
Bank Group on the work program of the Institute with special reference to the
training of teachers, the reform of the examination system, and the establishment
of a "tracer system" 1/ to follow up employment of the students after gradua-
tion from project schools; the views will be exchanged within one year of the
signing of the Credit and Loan Agreements.
4.04      Lower Secondary Schools.  The reform of secondary education requires
an increase in the proportion of total enrollment in Government schools in
order to facilitate and expedite the introduction of new examination, curricula
and teaching methods. In addition, replacement of some of the poorest private
schools by public schools is expected to follow the completion of the studies
by the Ramphul Commission. The Government plans to establish, under the present
project, six lower secondary schools with a total of 3,300 places. Emphasis
would be placed on the teaching of rural crafts related to the students' envi-
ronment (para 3.13) and the institutions would be located in rural villages
where there are no schools to cater for children of farming families; they
would represent a network of Government schools directed, at the same time,
to provide the type of skilled manpower required for economic development
(paras 2.09-2.11) and to help redress the regressive impact on social mobility
of the existing system of secondary education (para 3.05). Upon completion
1/ The tracer system is a controlled method of evaluating the progress of
graduates in the labor market.



- 12 -
of the-four-year course, the students could either: (a) be admitted to upper
secondary education in one of the Government schools offering the full seven-
year course and then have access to post-secondary education; (b) enter
the labor market as apprentices; or (c) proceed to further specialization in the
ITTCs. The avenue they would take would be determined on the basis of aptitude
tests developed by the Institute of Education as a part of the examination
reform (para 3.08).
4.05      The Industrial Trade Training Center (ITTC) to be located at Piton
in the north of the island would provide one-year courses for about 200 trainees
in tractor mechanics, light sheet metal, maintenance fitting, upholstery and
cabinet making. Courses in machine shop, electricity, automechanics, welding,
plumbing, carpentry and masonry are being provided in an existing ITTC at
Beau Bassin near Port Louis, established with UNDP/ILO assistance. The demand
for training for both industry sponsored and private trainees is so large that
in spite of double shift working only 280 out of 800 applicants could be ad-
mitted this year to the existing ITTC. The output from the existing and pro-
posed ITTCs would meet only 10% of the estimated requirements for skilled
workers (Annexes 4 and 12); shortages of instructors prevent a larger expan-
sion than envisaged under the present project. The balance of skilled workers
would be met through in-plant training of secondary school leavers.
4.06      The Rural Education Centers (RECs) would provide short agricultural
and rural craft courses to adults and youngsters in support of the Government
agricultural diversification policy (para 2.04) and to prepare school leavers
toward self-employment in farming (para 2.11). The RECs would be located on
the same site as existing primary schools and their facilities would consist
of workshops for agriculture, rural handicraft, and domestic science. The
participants in the courses would work under conditions similar to those
prevailing on small farms and, upon completion of the courses, would be affi-
liated with the National Federation of Young Farmers and with the programs
of the Ministry of Cooperatives (Appendix 1, paras 15 and 16). The courses
being developed feature the use of the vernacular (Creole) as the medium of
instruction, and emphasize dairy farming, animal husbandry and vegetable
production. In order to elaborate further the content of the courses and
develop a scheme for the evaluation of the RECs; the Government is establishing
an Inter-Ministerial Committee.
4.07      The five RECs would be of an experimental nature and represent
the first phase of a broader scheme to be implemented after evaluation of
their impact on rural development. This continuous evaluation would be carried
out by the Institute of Education in cooperation with other Government agencies.
During negotiations, the Government confirmed that detailed proposals for the
courses to be carried out in the RECs will be prepared within two years of signing



- 13 -
of the Credit and Loan Agreements. Locations for the RECs would be selected
by the Inter-Ministerial C mmittee referred to in the previous paragraphs.
It is likely that four RECs would be established in the same villages where
the IDA-assisted Rural Development Project is providing terracing to increase
vegetable production and assistance to livestock development (para 2.04). The
fifth REC could be located in the village of Esperance Trebuchet where the
Government has launched a farm development scheme. The instructors for the
RECs would be trained at the Primary Teacher Training College in cooperation
with the Institute of Education and the School of Agriculture at the University
of Mauritius.
4.08      Technical Assistance.  Successful implementation of the project
would require staff and program development for the proposed ITTC. Eleven
man-years of specialist services and five man-years of fellowships would be
needed to staff the ITTC during its initial stage. Similarly, the Program
Implementation Unit (PIU) would need about seven man-years of specialist
services. Therefore, the project would include a total of 18 man-years of
specialist services and five man-years of fellowships as detailed in Annex
13.

5.02      Customs Duties and Taxes.  All instructional equipment and furniture
specifically imported for the proposed project would be exempt from direct
customs duties and taxes in accordance with Government regulations. Of the
estimated civil works costs of US$4.2 million equivalent, about US$380,000
equivalent would represent customs duties and taxes.
5.03      Construction cost estimates have been derived from recent buildings
costs in Mauritius as recorded by2the Ministry of Works, the DWC and private
contractors. Building costsper m of gross floor area are estimated at
US$100 equivalent for classrooms, communal and administration areas, US$125
equivalent for workshops and US$145 equivalent for laboratories. These unit
costs take account of the heavier structures needed to withstand cyclones.
Site development costs are estimated at 10% of construction costs. A local
cost adjustment of 10% has been included for construction outside the Port
Louis area. The proposed schedules of accommodation are functional and
economical. Furniture and equipment cost estimates are reasonable; detailed
equipment lists are being prepared on the basis of basic equipment lists
developed by the World Bank Group, Unesco and ILO.
5.04      Contingency allowances add 10% for unforeseen factors to the cost
estimates of site development and construction and 5% to the cost estimates
of furniture, equipment and PIU expenses. Contingencies for price increases
total 48% of the cost of the project without contingencies and 31% of the
cost of the project including contingencies and are based on annual rates of
increase of 12% for civil works and 9% for equipment and furniture reckoned
up to the estimated dates of contract awards.
5.05      The foreign exchange component totals US$7.4 million equivalent
(including contingencies) and represents 66% of total project cost net of
taxes and has been calculated as follows: civil works 53%; furniture 54%;
equipment 90%; technical assistance 80%; Program Unit expenses 80%; and
professional services 40%. This high foreign exchange component reflects
the emphasis of the project on providing instructional equipment and also
the fact that building materials are mostly imported.
Financial Plan
5.06      The total project cost of US$11.6 million equivalent would be
financed as follows: (a) the IDA credit and the Bank loan of US$3.5 million
equivalent respectively would meet the c.i.f. cost of equipment and the
estimated foreign exchange costs of civil works, furniture and professional
services, (b) the Government of Mauritius would finance the remaining project
costs. Altogether the Bank Group assistance would be equivalent to about 95%
of the estimated foreign exchange component. The financial plan is summarized
below:

1/ Including specialist services for the Program Unit.
In addition, it is likely that most of the technical assistance and fellowships
(US$410,000 equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$330,000 equivalent)
would be provided under a bilateral program: in particular, the Mauritius
Government has already received assurances from the Government of India for
the provision of the technical assistance related to the ITTC. The costs of
the project financed by the Bank Group would represent 37% of the capital
education budget for the period 1974/75-1979/80 and this reflects the major
contribution of the project toward the entire investment plan for education
(Annex 11).
5.07      The recurrent expenditures generated by the project would be about
Mau Rs 6.5 million p.a., or only some 6% of the estimated total recurrent
expenditure on education for 1979/80 because the project does not provide for
a substantial expansion in enrollment (para 4.01).
Project Implementation
5.08      Administration.  The Government is establishing a Program Implemen-
tation Unit (PIU) within the Ministry of Education with overall responsibility
for implementing investment programs in support of the education plan, inclu-
ding the proposed project. They key staff of the PIU would be a Program
Manager, an Architect and a Procurement Specialist, all on a full-time
basis and selected in consultation with the Bank Group and whose terms of
reference would be discussed with the Bank Group. Adequate supporting staff
including a full-time Accountant/Book-keeper would be provided by the Govern-
ment. Salaries of the key staff (with the exception of the Program Manager



- 17 -
and Accountant/Book-keeper), cost of furniture/equipment, maintenance, supplies
and general expenses of the PIU are included in the total project cost. The
PIU Manager was appointed before negotiations. A condition of effectiveness
of the credit and loan is the establishment of the PIU and the appointment of
the Architect.
5.09      Professional Services.  Design work, preparation of bidding and
contract documents and supervision of Government school construction is
normally the responsibility of the Ministry of Works (MOW). However, because
it is inadequately staffed to execute the civil work included in the proposed
project, a firm of consultants would be retained to execute design work and
preparation of contract documents and supervision of construction.
5.10      Construction.  The building industry is working to capacity. The
Government is, therefore, relying more on the DWC for construction of public
buildings at reasonable costs, e.g. DWC is carrying out all civil works under
the IDA-assisted rural development project. DWC would construct project in-
stitutions and has expressed its intention of strengthening its staff with
the addition of three civil engineers to work as full-time construction
managers for the project's schools. The Government has indicated that the
Indian Government is supplying the services of these engineers under a
bilateral technical assistance program. During negotiations, the Government
provided assurances that the required civil engineering staff will be
available in the DWC.
5.11      Phasing of Construction.  Subsequent to establishment of the PIU,
the project would be implemented over a period of five years. Construction
would be in two phases with the ITTC, three LWCs and three lower secondary
schools comprising phase one and the remaining project institutions con-
stituting phase two (Annex 15).
Procurement
5.12      Building Materials and Components would be procured in bulk, in
sizable packages under international competitive bidding, in accordance with
Bank Group guidelines for procurement. Awards of contracts for supplies of
building materials and components would not require prior review by the Bank
Group unless the amount exceeds US$100,000 equivalent.
5.13      Instructional Equipment and Furniture.  Instructional equipment
would be procured in bulk and contracts would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank Group guidelines for
procurement; contracts in amounts of less than US$50,000 would not require
the Bank Group review prior to awards. It is expected that most or all of
the instructional equipment contracts would be awarded to foreign suppliers.
Furniture would also be procured after international competitive bidding,
in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Items would be grouped to the
extent practicable to form sizable bid packages and to permit bulk procurement.



- 18 -
The local furniture manufacturing industry is competitive and it is therefore
unlikely that foreign manufacturers would win any contracts. Preferred domestic
manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15Z or the existing
rates of import duties, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing
imports. Procurement is expected to be completed by March 31, 1978.
Sites
5.14      The site for the ITTC has been already acquired by the Government
but sites for the other project institutions are yet to be selected; no problems
are expected in their selections and acquisitions. In order to expedite con-
struction work, the Government will furnish to the Bank Group plans and des-
cription of all project building sites, with the exception of the RECs, with-
in six months of signing of the Credit and Loan Agreements. The detailed
proposals regarding the sites of the RECs will be prepared and furnished to
the Bank Group within two years of the signing of the Credit and Loan Agreements
(para 4.07).
Disbursements
5.15      Disbursements will be on the basis of:
(i) 100% of foreign expenditures for Program Unit
expenses, imported construction materials, building
components, furniture and instructional equipment or
the ex-factory cost of furniture and instructional
equipment if manufactured locally;
(ii) 40% of total expenditures of architectural
consultant services.
(iii) 25% of total expenditures of civil works; excluding
expenditures for construction materials and building
components.
Disbursements will be fully documented with the exception that disbursements
for Program Unit expenses will be made against a certificate of expenditure,
documentation of which will not be submitted for review but retained by the
Borrower and will be available for inspection by the Bank Group in the course
of project supervision. Upon agreement between the Government and the Bank/
Association, any funds remaining on completion of the project would be used
for other project related items.   The proposed Closing Date is March 31, 1980.



- 19 -
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The contribution of the project to economic growth is indicated by
its role in meeting manpower requirements, both quantitatively and qual-
itatively. In the early 80's, the schools and centers established and/or
improved under the project would provide for about half of the total in-
stitutional supply of craftsmen and skilled workers and for some 75% of the
secondary school graduates with a practical background. With improved
facilities, curricula and teaching methods, the contribution of training to
productivity is expected to be substantial. Although comprehensive data are
lacking, a sample survey conducted by Bank Group staff in Mauritius indicates
that the cost of training on-the-job school leavers without a practical back-
ground is high (up to Mau Rs 6,000 in some industries); as a comparison the
average cost of training in collaboration with the ITTC is about Mau Rs 3,500.
Although no data are available, the cost of on-the-job training for school
leavers with a practical background is expected to be considerably lower than
that of those from literary courses.
6.02      The project would help reduce economic and social disparities by
(a) assisting the expansion of public secondary education in rural areas; (b)
promoting the improvement of private secondary schools; and (c) developing
specific programs for school-leavers and adults to prepare them for self-
employment in farming. About one-half of the new student-places to be provided
by the proposed project would be in small towns and rural areas and the re-
mainder, although located in urban centers, would directly support private
schools enrolling students from low income families and so would improve educational
opp^rtunities and social mobility.  Improvements in income distribution can
be anticipated from the revision of the tuition and fee system (para 3.09)
and the examination and teacher training reform (para 3.08) which are included
in the education program of which the project is an integral part.
6.03      The project would be a major contribution to the education plan
(para 3.07), place emphasis on the areas of greatest strategic significance,
support administrative and organizational improvements and the application of
more relevant curricula. As a result, education would have a more practical
emphasis which would increase its capability of supplying outputs with the
skills and attitudes required by an economy in process of structural trans-
formation and characterized by increased labor mobility by sector, category and
level of employment.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations agreements were reached with the Government on
the following principal points:
(a) the exchange of views with the Bank Group on the findings of the
Ramphul Commission, the programs for the Institute of education
and the courses and locations for the RECs (paras 3.09, 4.03, 4.07);



- 20 -
(b)  the staffing of the PIU and of the DWC (paras 5.08 and 5.10); and
(c)  the selection and acquisition of sites for the project institutions
(para 5.14).
7.02      In addition to the usual conditions of effectiveness, a further
condition would be the establishment of the PIU and the appointment to it
of the Architect.
7.03      Subject to the conditions above, the proposed project constitutes
a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$3.5 million equivalent, on standard
terms, and a Bank loan of US$3.5 million equivalent to the Gover*ient of
Mauritius for a term of 25 years including a 10-year grace period.



APPENDIX 1
MAURITIUS
APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT
The Education and Training Sector
1.        Administration, Structure and Principal Issues.  Public education
in Mauritius is mainly the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and
Cultural Affairs. Ministries of Cooperatives, Health, Youth and Sports, the
Municipality of Port Louis, etc., exercise some educational functions. There
is a need for improved coordination of the administration of technical and
vocational training and for controlling the prolification of private secondary
schools. The Roman Catholic and the Hindu Education Authorities administer
the schools under their denominations.
2.        The education system comprises six years of primary education
followed by a five- or seven-year secondary education, leading respectively
to the Cambridge School Certificate (CSC) and Cambridge Higher School Certi-
ficate (CHSC); and university courses of various durations are also offered
(Chart 1). Public primary education is free and public secondary education,
although fee-paying, is supplemented by a scholarship scheme.
3.        Despite the fact that Mauritius has achieved high quantitative
development of its education system, the sector suffers from a number of
weaknesses:
(i) As a result of the theoretical emphasis of the examinations, 1/
graduates are not equipped with practical training and
experience to enable them to be productively engaged in
tlauritius' expanding manufacturing industries and in
agriculture. Facilities for the teaching of science and pre-
vocational courses are inadequate; and modern methods of
teaching are rarely used. While there are a significant
number of unemployed school leavers with general education,
the shortages of skilled and middle-level technicians
persist and are becoming acute.
1/   Examinations are prepared and corrected in the UK; an examination
syndicate, to develop exams more related to the country's needs and
environments, has been established within the newly created Institute
of Education.



APPENDIX 1
Page 2
(ii) Government academic and administrative control over private
schools which accounts for about 95% of the total secondary
enrollment is almost nonexistent. The quality of education
is particularly poor in the "non-aided" private schools which
account for some 80% of the total secondary enrollment and
often have unsuitable rented premises.
(iii) Facilities for agricultural and rural training are not
sufficiently developed.
The General Education System
4.        Primary school enrollment increased by about 2% annually for the
five years prior to 1972 when it reached the figure of 152,000 repre-
senting 93% of the eligible age group. 1/ Pupil/teacher ratio is low (32:1)
and 90% of teachers are qualified. Promotion in Standards I to V (Grades
1-5) is automatic and dropout rate below Standard V is low (less than 1% in
Standards I to II and less than 3% in Standards III to V). After Standard
V, dropout rate increases to 20%. More than 20% of the classes are held in
unsuitable rented buildings. In addition to Creole, which is the mother tongue
of most children entering primary schools, French and English are taught, the
latter being the official language of instruction. Language and mathematics
take up 50-66% of the school timetable, the remaining time being devoted to
science, geography, hygiene, civics, physical education, handiwork and
needlework, music, oriental languages and religious instructions.
5.        Primary teacher training is of two years duration with the Cambridge
School Certificate as admission requirement. About 250 students graduate every
year, 50% of whom are employed for replacing teachers who leave or retire from
the profession. Each trainee after receiving his/her certification remains
on probationary status for two years.
6.        Enrollment in secondary education totals 52,730 representing
about 30% of the relevant age group. Education at this level is too literary
oriented and examinations prepared in the UK dominate all educational prac-
tices and student activities. Dropout rate in Government schools is a low
5% but about 20% in private schools. Less than 10% of secondary school
graduates proceed to higher education. Average pupil/teacher ratrio is satis-
factory (31:1), but about 40% of the teachers are unqualified. A small
percentage of aided private schools has a number of graduate teachers for
whom the Government supports between one-third and two-thirds of their
salary. No secondary teacher training program was available until the recent
establishment of the Institute of Education.
1/ Includes over-age children; net enrollment ratio of the 5-11 age group
is 86%.



APPENDIX 1
Page 3
7.        Teaching at the secondary level is too compartmentalized, each
subject being taught in isolation from other related subjects. Secondary
students, due to the requirements of the examination system, concentrate on
only five or six subjects. The tendency is that the student chooses those
subjects which he judges to be the simplest to pass and does not obtain the
guidance required to select his subjects of study with a view to receiving
a balanced education. His knowledge in certain subjects may be in-depth but
he may know very little in some essential subjects and ignore vital inter-
relationships between disciplines, e.g., between biology and chemistry. Such
rigid compartmentalization of subject matter has resulted in narrow and
inappropriate specialization which has indirectly contributed to the unemploy-
ment problem of secondary school leavers.
8.        A further difficulty is the fact that although English is a
compulsory subject, students have rarely a good command of it before Form IV
(Grade 10). They speak Creole, French and oriental languages at home and
often English language difficulties account for the high failure rate in
School Certificate Examinations. There is an urgent need to review the present
examination system and prepare curricula and teaching materials more relevant
to the present and future requirements of Mauritius. For this reason, the
recently established Institute of Education has given highest priority to the
creation of an examination syndicate.
9.        Out of a total secondary school enrollment of 52,730, the following
four Government secondary schools account for 2,940 (or 5.6% of the total)
students: (i) Royal College of Port Louis; (ii) Royal College of Curepipe;
(iii) Queen Elizabeth College at Rose Hill; and (iv) John F. Kennedy College
at Rose Hill. Four Government lower secondary schools together account for
700( students (or 1.3%); enrollment in 13 aided schools is 7,500 (or 14%)
and in 114 non-aided private schools enrollment is 41,600 (or 79%). The
four Government lower secondary schools are located in major towns and some
14,000 students compete annually for 200 places available in these institu-
tions. During the last three years of the four-year program of the lower
secondary schools, 40% to 50% of the time is devoted to practical training
in woodwork and metalwork, home economics and needlecraft, agricultural
sciences, and commerce.
10.       Most private schools are poorly equipped and housed and cannot
provide the complete secondary course nor any kind of science teaching and
practical training.  In 1972, some 35,000 students sat for the Primary School
Leaving Certificate Examination.  Of some 20,000 that passed the examination,
the very best 500 found places in Government secondary schools and the next
best 2,000 were admitted to the grant-aided secondary schools. The majority
of remaining 17,500 primary school leavers, mostly from low income families
went to private secondary schools paying fees three to four times higher than
those charged by Government secondary schools.



APPENDIZ 1

Specialized Education
11.       Technical education and training is provided at the following
Government institutions:
(i) four lower secondary schools where some 700 students
12-15 years of age are introduced to the materials and
tools of woodwork, metalwork and the application of gen-
eral sciences (para 9);
(ii) John F. Kennedy College where prevocational training is
provided in woodwork, metalwork, technical drawing, and
commercial skills to about 220 students aged 13-19;
(iii) the Industrial Trade Training Center where, in cooperation
with industry, one-year craftsmen courses are offered mostly
to people already in employment. Courses include machine shop,
auto mechanics, electrical installations, welding, plumbing
and pipe fitting, masonry and carpentry. The capacity in
each course is about 20 but is expanded considerably by
using staggered scheduling. In addition, a number of short
evening courses are offered for supervisors;
(iv) the five small-scale industrial training centers train
mostly young girls in different crafts with the intention
of helping them start small enterprises of their own. In
1971, 342 trainees completed their courses: in dressmaking
and embroidery (162 women), basketry (105 women), leatherworks
(33 men) and general handicrafts (42 men). The courses last
18 months to two years, leading to certificate awards and a
gift of tools;
(v) the Hotel and Catering Training Program operated by the
Ministry of External Affairs, Tourism and Immigration,
provides basic training facilities for the hotel and catering
industry;
(vi) specialized training institutions for extension workers,
marine, and health assistants.
12.       Technical education and training is not sufficiently developed and
the output from existing institutions does not meet the need for industrial
skilled workers and other technical manpower. Of the primary school leavers
who complete Grade 6, less than 4% are admitted into (i) the three prestigious
Government secondary schools which qualify most students for university
admission and professional training; (ii) the John F. Kennedy College; and
(iii) the four lower secondary schools where they have the opportunity to
pursue prevocational courses.



APPENDIX 2
MAURITIUS
APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT
The Institute of Education
A.   Research Activities
The Institute of Education is expected to conduct educational re-
search in the following areas:
1.        The Identification of National Requirements and Curriculum DeveloPment.
In line with the Government policy, the Institute will undertake studies in
identifying national requirements and translate them into curricula specifi-
cations. The research findings are expected to assist in the development
and testing of teaching/learning materials including new textbooks, audio-
visual aids and teachers' manuals, using where possible local resources and
involving teachers and students. Action research would be directed toward
the development of suitable curricula, syllabi and examinations for primary,
secondary, technical and vocational education.
2.        The Problem of Second Languages in Primary Schools will be studied
with a view to finding ways and means of promoting the more efficient teaching
of English so that after a six-year primary schooling, the Mauritian child
would acquire a good knowledge of the official language of the country.
Since French is the main "lingua franca" in Mauritius, and is at present
studied by all Mauritian students, its teaching should be improved.
3.        Basic Science and Environmental Studies.  Although the Ministry of
Education has decided to introduce environmental studies in the primary
school, no syllabus has yet been elaborated and very little course material
has been produced; this would be done by the Institute of Education. Similar-
ly a study of science education will be undertaken to specify operational
guidelines for developing an integrated science curriculum.
4.        Social Studies.  There is at the moment a growing awareness of the
need for inclusion of new subjects at the secondary level which would offer
more meaningful options to students. At present subjects such as Latin,
Greek and Religion are frequently chosen simply for lack of other alterna-
tives. The inclusion of social studies in the curriculum of the secondary
schools may assist broadening the programs especially for those students
specializing in liberal arts.
5.        Agricultural Education.  Agricultural education will have to be
reviewed and its place in the primary and secondary schools discussed in
terms of the harmonization and/or articulation of general education and
agricultural (or prevocational) education. This will call for recommendation
and the preparation of course material for both pupils and teachers.



APPENDIX 2
Page 2
6.        Reorganization of Technical Courses.  The provision of prevocational
courses is designed to counteract the almost exclusive literary orientation
of the present education system. This will be brought about by the expansion
of lower secondary schools. A survey of the content of the courses in such
institutions will be undertaken and recommendations will be made which take
into account the progress of the pupils as they proceed from lower secondary
schools to apprenticeship and/or other institutions.
7.        Modern Mathematics.  The teaching of modern mathematics in the
schools is far from satisfactory. Apart from the lack of adequately trained
teachers, one serious cause of failure is the difficulty that average Mauritian
students experience in acquiring mathematical concepts taught in a language
which is foreign to the majority of them. Research will help clarify the
difficulties, devise and elaborate textbooks within the reach of the average
child taking cognizance of the correlation between language and mathematical
ideas.
B.   Teacher Education
8.        Training of teachers would be a major responsibility of the Institute.
Methods are at present being devised to raise the standard of both pre- and
in-service training by the application of modern techniques.
9.        Training teachers for metalwork, woodwork, technical drawing and
home economics for the envisaged lower secondary schools and the laboratory
and workshop centers would receive the highest priority. There is a sufficient
supply of general teachers, e.g., mathematics, science, English and social
studies since there are many teachers of general subjects already in Mauritius
and only in-service professional training would be required for a large
proportion of them (see Annex 6).

13.       Another major difficulty in technical/vocational training is the
absence of a unified policy and an executive body to coordinate training and
trade certification. Four different Acts have been promulgated on the subject,
empowering different Ministries to undertake this responsibility:
(i) The Employment and Training Ordinance No. 14 of 1963 makes
provision with respect to the functions of the Minister of
Labor and Social Security relating to employment, training
and the collection and processing of manpower information.
It establishes a Labor Advisory Board and empowers the
Minister to provide vocational training.
(ii) The Industrial Training (National Advisory Council) Act No. 8
of 1968 is intended to provide for a national system of
vocational and technical education. This Act established under
the Ministry of Education a National Advisory Council including
20 members and an executive body, the National Office for Indus-
trial Training Office (NOIT). NOIT was intended to direct and
coordinate all vocational and technical education, to organize
and supervise all industrial training programs, and to set up
and manage trade training centers. NOIT was to be established
under the control and supervision of a National Director for
Vocational and Technical Training. Neither was NOIT esta-
blished, nor was the director appointed.
(iii) The Apprenticeship Act No. 9 of 1968 makes provision for
periods of apprenticeships, rate of wages, qualification,
training, tools and equipment and other conditions to be
provided. This Act established a Central Apprenticeship Com-
mittee under the Ministry of Labor with members from Employers
Federation, Public Works, ITTC, building, electrical,
engineering trades, controllers (employment) services.
(iv) The Trade Proficiency Certification Act No. 40 of 1972
establishes the Trade Proficiency Certification Board
whose Chairman is the Principal Assistant Secretary of
Ministry of Employment and on which committee 11 other
agencies including the Ministry of Education are
represented. The Board's responsibilities include
conducting trade tests and examinations, preparation
and award of certificates.
14.       These acts have omissions and overlapping responsibilities result-
ing in inter-departmental conflicts and delaying the establishment and effec-
tive operation of a much needed coordinating body for trade training and
certifications. Ihe appointment of the Director of Vocational and Technical
Training under Act No. 8 of 1968 is strongly recommended by the ILO experts
in Mauritius. The Government is now developing a unified legislation for
trade certification and training.



APPENDIX 1

15.       Agricultural Education.  At secondary level no organized agricultural
training exists at present. Some efforts have been made to provide such train-
ing but they were without well-defined objectives and without adequate finan-
cial allocations. The Youth Training Program at Arsenal is one of four similar
schemes of the Ministry of Cooperatives to train unemployed youth 18-25 years
old for employment in farming. After nine months of training, the trainees
were to receive two arpents (0.8482 ha) of land in order to organize themselves
into cooperatives. For this program, 200 young men with primary education
were grouped under an agricultural extension agent, but due to general scarcity
of land in the country, the scheme has not been fully implemented.
16.       The National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs has been responsible
for training in agriculture a number of unemployed primary and secondary
leavers. The Federation has provided instruction twice a week, using agri-
cultural officers and has assisted in developing a school garden program.
Through organizing various groups the Federation has made a significant impact
in increasing food crops including vegetables. The most valuable achievement
of the Federation is perhaps the advice and encouragement it provides to the
educated unemployed to engage themslves in rural projects (e.g., small crop
diversification schemes, building of simple infrastructure such as bridges
and feeder roads). To mitigate the problem of scarcity of land, the Federa-
tion has successfully negotiated the lease of land from the sugar estates for
some of its members. It also intends to obtain crown lands for distribution
to individual farmers under the programs.
17.       Other non-formal education is provided by Youth Training Farms, the
rlauritius College of the Air (MCA), various inplant training and upgrading
schemes.  Agricultural programs are also organized through the medium of
radio and television.
ligher Education
18.       Form VI College or Pre-University Education.  At present there are
a total of 2,500 students in Form VI classes (Grades 12-13) representing
only 5% of the total secondary enrollment. Two secondary schools including
one Form VI College, are expected to be established with FED assistance. The
curricula of these schools would be similar to the John F. Kennedy College
which offers a full seven-year academic and prevocational secondary education.
19.       The new Form VI College would have five streams:  1 Arts, 1 Economics
and 3 Science and would cater for 450 full-time students (boys and girls).
In addition, about 100 part-time students would use the facilities outside
normal school hours. These are mainly pupils coming from schools not having
a Form VI course.
20.       The annual output from the present Form VI courses (about 1,500)
does not meet projected needs for intake into the University and other post-
secondary institutions to be established in the late seventies and early
eighties and the additional requirements for middle-level personnel with
scientific and professional training.



APPENDIX 1

21.       The University of Mauritius, established in 1965, has a full-time
and part-time enrollment of about 1,300; students follow degree, diploma
and certificate courses in agriculture, sugar technology and engineering,
public administration including social studies and business management.
In addition, about 500 persons already in employment follow non-award
training courses. The university has a full-time staff of 75.
22.       The University has received assistance for building and equipment
from various sources including UK, France, Barclays Bank, and private
foundations. FED has also been approached by the Government for financing
additional buildings for the schools of Agriculture, Business and Public
Administration and Industrial Technology.
23.       The School of Agriculture awards degrees and diplomas in agriculture
and sugar technology and certificates in cane cultivation. A new diploma
course in medical laboratory technology was started recently. Plans are
underway to reorganize the school's program to offer a wide range of courses
including agricultural economics and management, animal production, physical,
biological and chemical sciences; crop production; and research and extension.
24.       The School of Administration awards certificates in secretarial
studies and social work; and diplomas in public administration and management;
personnel management; financial management and accounting; and cooperative
studies.
25.       The School of Industrial Technology awards degrees in sugar techno-
logy, diplomas in civil, electrical and mechanical engineering, public health,
sanitary science, and land surveying and certificates of City and Guilds of
London Institute in road construction, telecommunications and electrical
technician's course.
26.       The Institute of Education, established by an Act of Parliament in
December 1973, is housed in temporary premises on the campus of the University.
It works in close liaison with both the Ministry of Education and the University
and is managed by a Council of 18 members representing the Prime Minister's
Office, the Ministries of Education, Finance, Economic Planning and Develop-
ment, the Public Service Commission, and the University. Initially, the
Institute would (i) provide pre-service and in-service teacher training with
particular emphasis on technical education; (ii) set up a curriculum develop-
ment unit; (iii) establish an examination syndicate; and (iv) conduct educa-
tional research.



APPENDIX 1
Page 8
27.       In-service teacher training programs commenced in May 1973 with
emphasis on practical subject for the implementation of the new curricula;
36 teachers of woodwork, metalwork and technical drawing commenced training
and further courses are planned. It is envisaged that about 220 students
would follow teacher training courses in metalwork, woodwork, home economics,
art and crafts, music, commerce, physical and general education. The training
program would comprise one-year, full-time, pre-service or two-year, part-time,
in-service courses. Courses will also be open to holders of degree or quali-
fication of similar standing and would lead to postgraduate education degrees
and certificates.
28.       The Institute's students may join university classes in such
subjects as physics, chemistry, biology and botany and, conversely, Institute
staff could offer courses in the social sciences for university students.
Physical facilities such as university library and laboratories, gymnasium
and language laboratories would be used in common. Areas of research activities
to which the Institute would give priority and the Institute's Technical
Teacher Training program are given in Appendix 2.
29.       UNDP assistance of about US$500,000 is being provided for the period
January 1973-December 1975: it consists of 133 man-months of experts (10
positions), 78 man-months of fellowships (8 positions), and US$90,200 for
equipment (including closed-circuit television). A director and the UNDP
Project Manager are already appointed. Government contribution in personnel,
equipment and buildings is about US$450,000 equivalent. A second phase of
UNDP assistance is expected to amount to US$500,000. ODA is expected to
contribute i 360,000 towards construction and equipment of the first phase
of the Institute (Table I).
30.       Educational Television (ETV) was inaugurated in 1969.  The subjects
offered are English language and literature, French language and literature,
mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology, economic and public affairs, his-
tory and geography. For the time being, the three daily telecasts are
geared to the requirements of the Cambridge School Certificate and Higher
School Certificate students. The lessons are prepared and presented by
teachers of the Government secondary schools and the aided secondary schools.
The Audio-Visual Center (AVC) of the Ministry of Education is in charge of
production, program coordination, supervision of scripts, and continuity of
broadcasts.
31.       ETV programs are transmitted live,using the facilities of the
Mauritian Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) after school hours. The lessons,
lasting 20 minutes each, are broadcast five days per week during school term.
Courses are designed primarily to assist secondary school students preparing
for their examinations but a series of programs for primary school teachers
of science, geography, French and English have recently been produced.



APPENDIX 1
Page 9
32.       The AVC has four graphic artists, two photographers, one recording
technician and one liaison officer. In addition, a staff of 11 is working
on educational radio. The staff, including the head of the Center, have
received training in Mauritius and overseas. The AVC located in Rose Hill,
lacks proper buildings and equipment and the Ministry of Education plans to
provide new facilities for the Center.
33.       An effective program is required to coordinate the services of
the AVC, the Mauritian College of the Air (MCA) and the micro-teaching
section of the Institute of Education to spearhead educational reform.
Education Finance
34.       General.  Education is financed from public and private sources.
The Ministry of Education finances primary and secondary education, technical
education, teacher training, adult education and the University of Mauritius.
Other Ministries involved in education financing are: External Affairs
(Hotel Training School), Cooperative Development (Agricultural and Youth
Training Centers), Labor and Social Security (Sea Training School), Health
(Nursing School), Communications (Telecommunications Training School), and
the Prime Minister's Office (Prison Industrial School for Girls).  The private
sector finances some primary education (27.7% of total enrollment in 1973)
and most of secondary education (94.6% of total enrollment in 1973).
35.       Public primary education is free.  Public secondary students pay
tuition fees of Mau Rs 10 per month in Form I, and additional Mau Rs 2 per
month for each succeeding form. Estimated revenues from tuition fees amounted
to Mau Rs 510,000 in 1972.
36.       Total Expenditure in Education.  Total public and private expendi-
tures on education in 1972-1973 are estimated as follows:
Recurrent    Capital       Total
(in thousand Mau Rs)
Ministry of Education                47,723.8    3,310.8      51,034.6
Other Ministries                       N.A.      1,306.7       1,306.7
Sub-total Public Sector           47,723.8    4,617.5       52,341.3
Private Sector                       17,200.0           -     17,200.0
Total                              64,923.8    4,617.5      69,541.3
Total expenditures in education are estimated to have reached 5.0% of GNP in
1972.



APPENDIX 1
Page 10
37.       Recurrent Expenditure.  Available information permits only the
analysis of the recurrent expenditures of the Ministry of Education. Expen-
ditures made by other Ministries cannot be accurately determined, but their
total amount is thought to be very small. From 1965-1966 to 1972-1973
recurrent expenditures by the Ministry of Education increased at an average
rate of 8.5% p.a. and the share of the total Government recurrent budget for
education grew from 12.6% to 14.6%. Preliminary estimates for 1973-1974
show an increase of 40% over 1972-1973, but owing to a corresponding increase
in total Government budget, the amount still represents 14.5%; this is a low
figure as compared to other countries of similar level of development. The
pattern of recurrent expenditures by level and type of education has been as
follows:
Percentage of Total
1965-1966         1972-1973
General Expenses                       4.0                4.1
Primary Education                     73.2               70.8
Secondary Education                   13.9                9.6
Technical Education                    0.5                1.9
University of Mauritius                0.2                4.0
Adult Education                        0.2                0.1
Teacher Training )80                                      5.6
Other            )                                        3.9
Total                           100.0              100.0
These percentages reflect the high priority given to primary and university
education at the expense of secondary education which has, for the most part,
been left in the hands of the private sector. Detailed breakdown of recurrent
expenditures of the Ministry of Education from 1965-1966 to 1972-1973 is given
in Annex 9.
38.       In 1972-73, salaries for various levels and types of education
accounted for 81% to 98% of the Ministry of Education recurrent expenditures.
Minimum monthly salary of a primary teacher is Mau Rs 910 (or about US$170),
the average secondary school teacher earns about 50% more. Between 1965-66
and 1972-73, the proportion of salaries in total primary education expenditure
has remained constant while increases in the proportion of salaries for second-
ary education have been observed reflecting the increased Government assist-
ance to "aided secondary schools".



APPENDIX 1
Page 11
39.       Annual recurrent expenditure per pupil in public primary education
increased from Mau Rs 215 in 1965 to Mau Rs 309 in 1973 (44%), and in public
secondary education from Mau Rs 982 to Mau Rs 1,064 (8%) during the same
period. Financial data on the private sector are incomplete; the unit costs
in 1973 are, however, estimated to be Mau Rs 150 and Mau Rs 200 for primary
and secondary education, respectively. The comparatively low expenditure per
pupil for private secondary schools reflects the poor quality of education
offered in most private schools (Table 2).
40.       Capital Expenditure.  Annual public investment in education remained
at the 1965-66 level (Mau Rs 3.5 million) until 1972-73 when it reached
Mau Rs 4.6 million. However, the share of education expenditures in the
Government capital budget decreased from 10.1% in 1965-66 to 3.8% in 1972-73.
The pattern of capital expenditures during the same period has been as follows:
Percentage of Total
1965-66     1972-73
Ministry of Education                         95.2         71.7
Primary Education                           76.2         30.5
Secondary Education                         17.9         24.1
Technical Education                          0.6          0.5
University                                   0.5          3.8
Other (Mahatma Ghandi Institute)               -         12.8
Other Ministries                               4.8         28.3
External Affairs                               -          0.9
Youth and Sports                               -          0.3
Cooperative Development                        -         18.9
Labor and Social Security                      -          8.0
Prime Minister's Office                      4.8          0.2
Total                                   100.0        100.0
The figures reflect the following:  (i) the increased role of Ministries other
than the Ministry of Education with respect to training, non-formal education
apprenticeship and trade certification; (ii) the decrease in primary school
construction due to slowdown in enrollment growth at this level; and (iii) the
increasing importance given to university and cultural affairs (Mahatma Ghandi
Institute).

41.       Government records of foreign aid are incomplete.  It is estimated,
however, that foreign assistance is equivalent to about 50% of total public
investment in education and training. Foreign assistance for recurrent
expenditures is estimated to have been negligible.
