INTERNATIONAL DEVEL[OPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSE) CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA FUR A
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (SECOND STAGE)
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation of a proposed
development credit to Ghana for the equivalent of US$10.4 million on standard
IDA terms to help finance a water supply project. The proceeds of the Credit
would be relent to the Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC) for 25
years, including 6-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per
annum. Under collaborative financing arrangements, the Canadian International
Development Agency would contribute US$7.5 million equivalent, to be relent
at 2-1/2 percent interest with the same repayment and grace periods as those
for the IDA Credit. An additional US$4.8 million equivalent would be lent by
the African Development Bank directly to GWSC for 22 years, including 5 years
of grace, with interest at 7 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
General
2.        The last economic report on Ghana (R72-223) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on October 3, 1972, and drew attention to the structural
problems of the economy. An industrial sector mission visited Ghana during
November 1973; its report is expected to be issued shortly. An economic
mission was in Ghana recently and its report should be available in early
fall. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Gross domestic product in real terms in Ghana increased by about
2.5 percent a year between 1969 and 1972, while the population grew at rates
ranging from 2.6 percent to 3 percent. Ghana seemed to have been caught in
the downward economic spiral of declining per capita income and consumption
affecting the capacity of the nation to save and invest. The Government is
engaged in trying to break this cycle and is preparing a long-term develop-
ment strategy for growth with stability.
4.        On external account, Ghana's problem has been excessive dependence
on cocoa exports -- cocoa still accounts for about 70 percent of merchandlse
exports. Accordingly, with widely fluctuating cocoa prices and Ghana's
declining share of worldwide production, the long-term balance of payments
situation remains somewhat uncertain.
5.        On public finances, there has been a tendency for current budget
expenditures to rise at a rapid rate and to outstrip revenues which are
overly dependent on cocoa export duties and import taxes. In addition to the
imbalance in the government bulget per se, there are a number of public agencies
and enterprises whose activities have not been jl'.iected to adequate economic
tests, and which are dependent on budget support or bank borrowings.



6.        in describ-ing these basic problems, the last economic report con-
cluded tnat, even with vigorous and determined policies on the part of the
-overnment, the necessary structural adjustments could only be effected gradually.
ThanaIs structural problems and slow growta should not obscure, however, the
strong points of its economy. Besides being the world's largest cocoa producing
and exporting country, Ghana has a variety of mineral resources as well as
substantial timber reserves. There is a reasonably advanced infrastructure.
Cocoa production is broad-based and benefits many small farmers. The education
system is well established; elementary education has been free and universal
since 1962. Favorable external developments and government policy action over
the past two years have laid the basis for more secure and sustained develop-
ment. Ghana has achieved a reasonable degree of monetary stability, made a
start in putting its state industries on a sounder economic footing and
exercised caution in its public investment decisions.
7.        During 1972 and 1973 the balance of payments position improved
dramatically. Compared to a trade deficit of about $40 million in 1971, trade
surpluses of about $160 million in 1972 and $100million in 1973 were achieved. In
1972 this was in part due to the very substantial retrenchment in imports
following the reimposition of an import licensing system. While imports in
1973 were expanded to meet the production needs of the economy and to replenish
stocks, continuin- high world prices for cocoa, gold and timber maintained a
trade surplus. In contrast with the practice in previous years, the surplus
has been used to repay some $40 million of Ghana's short-tem debts and to
build up reserves w1hich stood at about $200 million at the end of 1973, com-
pared to about $20 million at the end of 1971.
8.        While prospects for continued high world prices for cocoa and gold
seem good, the recent increases in petroleum prices are estimated to increase
Ghana's import bill by about $100 million and eliminate the anticipated
balance of payments surplus for 1974. Petroleum imports, which accounted for
less than one-tenth of total imports in 1970-72, would account for about 30
percent of imported goods in 1974. With the need to meet substa.1tial payments
obligations and to maintain an adequate level of short-term debt repayment,
the overall balance of payments position is likely to become difficult once
again. Therefore, Ghana will need new aid commitments to supplement the meagre
aid pipeline, and it is appropriate that a substantial part of these commit-
ments should be on concessionary terms.
9.        An agreement for a long-term rescheduling of Ghana's medium-term
external debt was reached at a meeting in Rome March 11-13, 1974. Under this
agreement, which was announced by the Govermnent of Ghana last April, all
payments due after February 1, 1972 in respect of pre-1966 debt obligations
will be paid over a period of 28 years, including a grace period of 10 years,
with an interest rate of 2-1/2 percent per annum. This concludes more than
two years of negot_ations between Ghana and the creditor countries, in which
the good offices of the Bank were provided. The rescheduling agreement is
expected to go into effect this summer provided the creditors are satisfied
that the results of Ghana 's review of the contracts underlying the medium-term
debts do not put in quest-on the basis of the debt settlement. The review is to
be completed by June 30, 1974. The exact impact which the Rame agreement will have
on Ghana's future debt service obligations will of course depend on the outcome
of this review. It iill be affected as well by the extent of the implementation



- 3 -
of the agreement and its application to creditor countries not represented at
the Rome meeting. These cannot be ascertained now but, given the size of
Ghana's debt obligations, the relief obtained should prove to be substantial.
10.       In Decmber 1972 the Government announced a new investment policy
redefining the ground rules for foreign private investment in Ghana with a
view to encouraging more indigenous participation in those sectors which exert
a major influence on the economy. The Government is currently engaged in
negotiating compensation arrangements with the affected parties; some settle-
ments have already been reached.
11.       On the basis of the understandings reached at the Rome meeting, and
on the assumption that a substantial part of Ghana's external borrowing require-
ments will be covered by aid on concessional terms, it is estimated that Ghana's
external debt service ratio will average about 5-6 percent in 1974-76 and rise
to some 10-12 percent during the remainder of this decade. The Bank Group's
share of Ghana's total external debt is currently about 12 percent and is
expected to rise but still remain small (14 percent) in relation to other
lenders over the next several years. Similarly, the Bank Group's proportion
of Ghana's future debt service is estimated to average 9-11 percent in the
near future. Bank Group lending to Ghana since 1969 has been exclusively on
IDA terms because of the large overhang of external debt service inherited
from the early 1960s. The agreement to reschedule service of most of the
medium-term suppliers' credits should open up possibilities for Ghana to
borrow abroad on conventional terms, and it is planned to resume Bank lending
to Ghana in the near future.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GHANA
12.       The Bank Group has lent Ghana $113.3 million, of which $47 million
was a Bank loan for the Volta Dam and associated infrastructure in 1962. The
remainder has been lent since 1968 for agriculture, power, water supply and
sewerage and roads projects. Annex II contains a summary statement of loans
and credits as of April 30, 1974 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
There are now no major problems in project implementation.
13.       Ghana is currently engaged in a major task of restructuring its
economy, particularly to achieve greater self-sufficiency in agricultural
products. Future Bank Group lending will support this objective, as reflected
in the livestock project presented to the Board on June 18, 1974 as we:Ll as
an oil palm project which was negotiated recently. A cotton project aind a
rice project have been appraised and are expected to be presented for con-
sideration by the Executive Directors in FY 1975. Follow-up projects in cocoa
and fisheries are planned thereafter. Apart from agriculture, the findings
of the industrial sector mission have indicated favorable prospects for pos-
sible lending for small-scale industry. In addition, while proportionately
lesS future Bank Group assistance than in the past is planned for infrastruc-
tural improvements, some additional lending is contemplated in this field to
support key institutions. The Bank is assisting Ghana in preparing telecom-
munications, power generation and distribution, highway maintenance and feeder
road projects.



PART III - WATER SUPPLY IN GHANA
14.       It is estimated that about 40 percent of Ghana's total population
has access to safe and dependable water supplies. In communities of 5,000
people and above, which account for 30 percent of the total population,
between 90 and 100 percent have such access. In the case of the remaining
70 percent of the popiulation, only about 15 percent have access to safe and
dependable water supplies. While water borne diseases such as dracontiasis
(Guinea worn infection) and bilharziasis have been virtually eliminated in
communities provided with piped water, these diseases are prevalent in rural
towns and villages which have no public water supplies. Such communities
are also vulnerable to cholera, which broke out in many parts of the country
in 1970-71.
15.       National responsibility for the provision, distribution and con-
servation of water and for the establishment, operation and control of
sewerage systems has been entrusted to the Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation
(GWSC), established in 1966 under the Ghana Water and Sewerage Act of 1965.
GWSC has been concerned primarily with water supply, but comiissio.aed its
first sewerage  scheme in November 1973. The scheme serves central Accra;
the only other sewerage scheme in Ghana is operated by the Tema Development
Corporation, the body responsible for Tema's industrial and residential
development.
GW.SC: The Management
16.       GWSC, the beneficiary of the proposed credit, is a statutory
corporation; and has a Board of seven part-time members including a representa-
tive of the Ministry of Works and Housing, to which the Corporation is
accountable. Board members are appointed by the Head of State. The present
managing director of GWSC was appointed in late 1973 after serving the
Corporation in senior positions for many years. With increased operations
and responsibilities, GWSC's management was decentralized in 1973. 41
District Management Centers were created within the Corporation's nine
regional organizations, of which the Accra/Tema Metropolitan Area (ATMA) is
by far the largest. GWSC has delegated to the District Management Centers
primary responsibility for operations, management and development in their
respective areas. This arrangement should contribute to increasing the
efficiency of the Corporation.
17.       The Accra/Tema Metropolitan Area (ATMA) manager was promoted to
his post in early 1973. Although technically sound, ATMA's management needs
some reinforcement in its financial administration. The Canadian Inter-
national Development Agency (CIDA) is expected to provide the required
technical assistance.



-5-
GWSCZ The National Investment Program
18.       GWSC is currently drawing up for Government approval a national
investment program (presently in a rudimentary form) in the water and
sewerage sector for 1975-79. The total cost of the program is estimated
at about US$170 million equivalent, of which about 80-90 percent is expected
to be allocated to the extension of water supplies to communities of less
than 5,000 people. The objective of the program is to provide 60 percent of
Ghana's population with a safe water supply by 1980. The program is to be
financed from the national budget and foreign sources. So far, about US$12
million of bilateral assistance has been granted by Canada, Germany and
Denmark for the construction of new water supply systems and the extension of
existing ones, mostly in rural areas. In audition to water supply, the program
includes a sewerage project to be constructed during 1975-79 in Kumasi, Ghana's
second largest city. The UNDP has approved a rural water supply and sanitation
project which is expected to provide a basis for a national rural water supply
program.
Tariffs
19.       In 1973, GWSC sought Government approval for a change in the levels
and structure of its water supply tariffs. The Corporation's proposal was that
tariffs for all consumers with private connections in major urban areas should
be raised, and that in the remaining communities tariifs should be unchanged
and in some cases lowered. The objective of the proposal was to enable GWSC
to achieve financial autonomy, while at the same time extending accessibility
to safe water supplies to an increasing number of rural communities. Imple-
mentation of GWSC's proposal would have a desirable inter-regional income dis-
tribution effect. The Government, however, while agreeing with the proposal
in principle, had decided to postpone a country-wide tariff change until all
connections in urban areas have been metered. More recently, in view of
ATMA's substantial investment program and the commitment made for the construc-
tion of Weija dam, Government approved a new tariff proposal increasing water
rates in the Accra/Tema Metropolitan Area from 40 Pesewas to 60 Pesewas per
1,000 gallons in respect of metered supplies to domestic consumers and from
90 Pesewas to Cedis 1.35 per 1,000 gallons in respect of metered supplies to
commercial and industrial consumers. This tariff increase of 50 percent is
to come into effect and the appropriate regulations issued not later than
August 1, 1974.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
20.       A report entitled, "Ghana, Appraisal of the Accra/Tema Water Supply
Project - Second Stage", dated May 31, 1974 and numbered 425a-GH is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A credit and project sum-
mary is provided in Annex III.



-6-
21.       This project would be the Bank Group's second credit for water
suuply in Ghana. It is the second stage of the implementation of a master
Dlan for water %nd sewerage for the Accra/Tema metropolitan area prepared
by consultants in 10('3-70 under a stuay financed by UNDP, with WHO as the
executing agency. In August 1969, IDA provided a credit of US$5.5 million
equivalent (CredLt o60-GH) to cover the foreign exchange cost of the first
stage project consis'ting of the extension of the water distribution system
in Accra and Tema anrd a new sewerage system in Central Accra.  These works
were satisfactorily completed in November 197s.
22.       The second stage project was first appraised in November 1971 but
was delayed due to t'ne uncertainties created by the initial economic measures
of the Government which assumed office in early 1972 and the precarious
financial and economic situation in the country at the time. The project was
then reappraised in March/April 197J, and the appraisal report was updated in
February 1974. In view of the substantial increase in the foreign exchange
component of the project since it was first appraised and the limited availa-
bility of IDA funds, the Government has sought parallel financing from the
African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA); and tlese institutions have agreed to provide the required
financing.  Approval of AfDB and CIDA contributions or a suitable alternative
arrangenent satisfac-,ory to the Association is a condition of effectiveness
of the IDA credit.   (Section 6.01(d) of the Development Credit Agreement).
Description
23.       The project would help increase water supply for the metropolitan
area where the population is growing around 5.b percent annually, as well as
adjacent rural areas. The demand for water has increased at an annual rate
of 12.5 percent in the last decade; with improved efficiency in the distri-
bution works and reduced leakages (from the current 39 percent to about
25 percent by 1982) demand is projected to increase at a lower rate of 8
percent per annumr until 1978 and 6.5 percent thereafter. The project will
expand the supplies of water from the current level of 8.5 million gallons
to 28 million gaIllons per day and will meet demand in the service area up to
about the mid-e:g,h`ies.
24.       The Prolec`- comprises the following components (for details see
Annex III):
A. IDA-Assiso       M2nents
Construction of neu dam at Weija; improvement of existing
Weija treatment works; extension of existing secondary and
tertiary water distribution system in Accra/Tema; extension
of water supplies in adjacent rural areas; provision of
water meters and leakage detection eauipment; technical
assistance for tne new sewerage system; training, and con-
sulting services for design and procurement.



-7-
B.  AfDB-Assisted components
Civil works for treatment plant and service reservoir; supply
of transmission mains; extension of the existing primary cis-
tribution system in Accra/Tema; ana miscellaneous items.
C. CIDA-Assisted comPonents
Raw water pumps; supply of treatment plant; and construction
supervision for components not financed by IDA.
Project Execution
25.       As in the case of the first stage project (Credit 160-GH), ATMA
would be responsible for project implementation.   ATnA operates with a con-
siderable degree of autonomy and keeps its own accounts (as provided for
under Section h.01 of the Project Agreement). Its operations equal the rest
of GWSC's operations combined.   It is aaequately organized and managed, and
successfully implemented the first stage project. However, in view of the
proposed additional investment under the second stage project, ATMA requires
assistance in financial management; and CIDA has been approached to provide
the required technical assistance (para. 17).
Project Cost and Financing
26.       The total estimated costs of the project are summarized below and
detailed in Annex III:
-US $ Million- - - 
Local     Foreign      Total     Pecenta
Weija Dam and Works         11.73      14.08       25.81        57.6
Rbiral Water Supply          2.91       0.48       3.39          7.6
Engineering Services
and Training              1.90       2.69       4.59         10.3

Total                   22.30      _22_       44.7t3       100.0
The three external financing agencies (IDA, CIDA, and AfDB) will provide the
total foreign exchange cost of the project estimated at US$22.4 million. The
proposed IDA credit would be re-lent by the Government to GWSC at 7-1/4 percent
for a term of 25 years, including 6-1/2 years of grace. It is expected that the
CIDA contribution would be re-lent at 2-1/2 percent with the same repaymenu and
grace periods as those for the IDA credit and that AfDB's loan would be made
directly to GWSC at 7 percent per annum for a term of 22 years, including 5 years
of grace.   The following table summarizes the financing of the total project
cost:



US$ Million    Percentage

Total                         U4-44.*7          100.0
Financial Position and Prosp2ects
27.       While GWSC as a whole continues to operate at a deficit and to
require Government subsidies, although on a smaller scale than in 1969, ATMA
has become financially self-sufficient and has been able to earn the 4 per-
cent rate of return in FY 1973 stipulated under Credit 160-GH. Moreover,
the projected debt/equity ratio of at least 58/42 and debt service coverage
of at least 2.2 are satisfactory, a minimxum borrowing limit debt service ratio
of 1.5:1 being provided for under Sectiorn 4.01 of the Project Agreement.
28.       ATMA's water revenues are projected to increase from their present
level oi about V5.1 million to 012.0 million by the end of the project con-
struction period. This increase of 135 percent would result from projected
increases in consumption, but more inmortantly from the proposed 50 percent
increase, effective not later than August 1, 1974, in the average tariff
(see para. 19). With the implementation of the proposed tariff increase,
ATYiA is expected to be able to meet its obligations under the Project Agree-
ment (Section 4.02) to earn a rate of return of not less than 7 percent,
except for the last two years of project construction for which a minimum
return of 3 percent was agreed in view of the increase in ATMA's asset base
and the lag between new investments and new revenues.   The implementation by
August 1, 1974 of a tariff increase that will provide ATMA with the required
rate of return in its fiscal year ending June 30, 1975 is a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Credit (Section 6.01 (c) of the Develop,ment Credit
Agreement).
29.       The Government has agreed to reimburse GWSC the amount of capital
costs and operating losses relating to financially non-viable projects or
services taken over by GWSC at Government request (Section 4.03 of the Develop-
ment Credit Agreement).
Procurement
30.       Contracts for the major project elements to be financed by IDA (dam,
related construction supervision, rural water supplies and extension of
existing secondary and tertiary distribution systems) either have been or will
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
IDA guidelines. Consulting services for design and preparation of tenders com-
menced in September 1972; and procurement of goods had to be started in mid-
1975 to permit the commencement of construction in the 1973/74 dry season and
to avoid delays in project execution. Project elements to be financed by CIDA
will be procured under CIDA guidelines, and items to be financed by AfDB will
be procured on the basis of AfDB's international competitive bidding procedures.



-9-
Disbursement
31.       The proceeds of the proposed Credit would be disbursed during the
period of FYs 1975-78 against the foreign exchange costs of the project com-
ponents to be financed by IDA.
32.       Retroactive financing estimated at about US$2.0 million is proposed
for the foreign exchange costs of the civil works and technical assistance
contracts for the IDA-assisted project components incurred between September
1972 and signature of the Credit.
Justification
33.       Water shortages are currently experienced in the Accra/Tema area
(with a population of about 900,000) in the dry season. Without the proposed
project, this situation would deteriorate further in the face of population
growth and increasing demands from industry and commerce as well as public
and private institutions and domestic households. The rural areas adjacent
to Accra/Tewa have only limited supplies of piped water and rely mainly on
generally polluted ponds, streams and wells. The project would extend safe
water supplies to these areas for the benefit of about 200,000 rural people.
34.       Studies of alternative sources have shown the Weija scheme to be
the least cost source of water supply for Accra. The only alternative
source, the Volta River at Kpong, was found to be more costly to develop.   It
would require a 48-mile transmission main from Kpong to Accra via Tema, plus
associated pumping facilities, compared to 7 miles of transmission main required
for Weija. In addition, the Weija dam would permit continuous use of existing
pumping, treatment and transmission capacity which at present is under-utilized
in the dry season due to inadequate river flows.
35.        Mhe economic benefits resulting from.the project include substantial
unquantifiable benefits which represent one of its main justifications. Ihese
inelude first the prevention of a progressive decline in health conditions in
Accra/Tema and the improvement of these conditions in the benefitting rural
areas. There are also the anticipated benefits of resettlement. Additional
benefits may accrue from the possible use of Weija lake for agricultural
irrigation.
36.       The facilities at the Weija Dam include minor works required to
comply with a Government plan to allow for irrigation development next to
the Wei.ja site. Preliminary analysis suggests that the irrigation project
would be feasible and have a substantial economic rate of return.   However,
its scale and implementation remain to be defined on the basis of a full.
feasibility study, as well as an investigation of potential sedimentation
in the reservoir. The Government has agreed to establish operational pro-
ceduress to determine the allocation of water from the Weija reservoir as
between public consumption and other purposes and to pay due regard thereto
in permitting any development involving water utilization.   (Section 4.05
of the Development Credit Agreement.)



- 10 -
Resettlement and Land Acquisition
37.       The reservoir to be formed by the dam will inundate about 12
square miles, of which 7 square miles have already been acquired by the
Government in connection with the existing Weija Works. The additional
land is subject to flooding during the rainy season and only a small frac-
tion of it is cultivated. There are eight villages within the area with a
present population of about 2,000. A detailed socio-economic survey of
the villages carried out by the University of Science and Technology,
Kumnasi, in 1969 showed that the villages had no infrastructure or social
services and that the villagers were willing to move to new sites suitable
for resettlement and farming. Resettlement will not disturb traditional
norms of the villages affected and will in fact improve their standard of
living by providing them with better housing, roads, water supply, sanitation,
health facilities and farming opportunities. Detailed planning and super-
vision of resettlement will be undertaken by the University of Kumasi.
Ecological Considerations
38.       The feasibility study of the project included a survey to investi-
gate possible health hazards that might result from the construction of the
new dam. The survey showed that malaria and bilharziasis are endemic in
the area; the hazard from these diseases should, therefore, decrease when
the present inhabitants are resettled away from the immediate vicinity of
the lake and bordering swamps, and provided with piped water and sanitary
facilities.
39.       GWSC are establishing a committee of experts to supervise and
coordinate investigations into the environmental impact of the Weija reservoir,
considering not only disease problems,but also water quality and potential
of the reservoir for game or commercial fisheries.
PART V - LIEAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       A draft Credit Agreement between the Republic of Ghana and the
Association, a draft Project Agreement between the Association and Ghana
Water and Sewerage Corporation, the recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d), of the Articles of Agreement of the Associa-
tion, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed Credit are being
distributed separately to the JExecutive Directors.
41.       Features of the Development Credit and Project Agreements of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 19, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29 and 36 of this
Report.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.

B.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 160-GH - Water Su,ply and Sewerage; US$3.5 million
Credit of August 28, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
1.        Tlis project comprised the extension of water distribution system
in the Accra/Tama metropolitan area and a new sewerage system in central
Accra. These works are complete. The credit also included the improvement of
the organization and operations of the national authority responsible for
Ghana's water supply and sewerage sector. The Ghana Water and Sewerage
Corporation is now functioning with significantly improved management and
satisfactory financial performance. Only retention payments for contract
services remain to be made, for which the original Closing Date of June 30,
1973 was extended to June 30, 1974.
Credit No. 163-GH - Fisheries; US$1-3 million Credit of
September 25, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
2.        This project was to have provided for:   (a) the construction of
forty purse seiners; (b) credits to fishermen for purchasing such vessels;
(c) fishing harbor improvement and expansion studies; and (d) the improvement
of the Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation's Boatyard Division. After
protracted problems over the design and price of the proposed boats, the number
of boats was reduced to 10, the procurement of their equipment is now virtually
concluded. All 10 of the boats should have been sold and delivered by now.
Delays have also been encountered in the execution of the harbor studies. Fol-
lowing the reduction in the objectives of the project, the Government has agreed
to cancel the remaining proceeds of the Credit except for those tunds required
to complete the final procurement and the port studies. Meanwhile, IDA has been
discussing with the Government a thorough re-examination of the fisheries sector
and identification of further investment needs for a possible second project.
The original Closing Date of December 31, 1972 was extended first to December
31, 1973 and then to June 30, 1975.
Credit No. 205-GH - Cocoa Rehabilitation; US$8.5 million Credit
of. June 26, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
3.        The project, principally involving the rehabilitation and replanting
of 87,000 acres of cocoa plantings, is proceeding quite well. During the
first year of field works, the replanting targets were met with excellent
nursery practices. Control of swoilen shoot virus disease is similarly well
1/ These notes are tesigned to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particilar to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
tVey do notpurportto present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
w3aknesses in project execution.

ahead of project requirements. However, the Sahelian drought caused a
reduction in the acreage of the 1972/73 replanting campaign to 5S percent
of the target. Lower annual replantings in the future are likely in addition.
An extension of the project period by one year on this account is con-
templated. The rehabilitation component of the project previously postponed
is now underway. With the elimination of this difficulty, project dis-
bursements should now proceed on the scheduled basis.
Credit No. 354-GH - Sugar Rehablxlitation; US$15.6 million
Credit of January 29, 973;   Closing Dates  March 311 1979
4.        Work on the project is proceeding satisfactorily.   HVA International
has been assisting Ghana Sugar Estates Ltd. in the operation of the two
sugar factories and estates, and t.eld plantings with effective results to
date. The Sugar Industry Committete has been established and ADB has written
off its unrecoverable debts. Field irrigation and drainage systems are
being rehabilitated and partially replanted. A survey in August 1973 showed
that the total outgrowers cane area covers about 4,000 acres more than
estimated in the Appraisal Report. Both factories have been overhauled
and are expected to produce a larger output in the next milling season. A
considerable volume of project equipment has been ordered, which should be
reflected in sizeable project disbursements in the near future.
Credit No. 438-GH - First Highway; US$13 million Credit of
November 21. 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
5.        This project comprises rehabilitating and improving 13 sections
of trunk roads totalling some 345 miles; consultants for supervision of
construction, pre-investment studies for further road rehabilitation and
preparation of road maintenance project; and the provision of equipment
for traffic control and pavement surveys. The project became effective in
January 1974. Its implementation is underway, delayed only slightly by
the Government's move to establish an independent highway authority which
should improve the performance of the previous Government road organization.
Rehabilitation and other road improvements are expected to start in November
1974., the beginning of the next dry season. A maintenance task force is
scheduled to conclude its preliminary report in July 1974.
