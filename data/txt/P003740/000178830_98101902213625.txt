REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS OF THE ASSOCLATION
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT BY THE ASSOCIATION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A FOURTH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CREDIT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$5
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Fourth Technical Assistance
project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The recent economic report on Indonesia (The Indonesian Economy: Recent
Developments and Prospects for 1974/75, November 26, 1973,(R73-273) describes
and analyses the substantial changes which have recently taken place in the
Indonesian eccnomy. A reassessment of Indonesia's longer term development
prospects and policies, which were described in last year's economic report,
(Development Issues for Indonesia, December 1, 1972, R73-6/4), will be necessary
in the light of these changes. The Second Five Year Plan,which is presently in
the final stages of preparation, will provide the basis for such a reassessment.
3.        After the economic disruption and spiralling inflation of the mid-
1960s, it took a major effort to stabilize the econony. After the introduction
of an effective stabilization program, there has been a fairly extended period of
recovery and rehabilitation under the First Five Year Plan (1969-73), and it now
appears that the economy can move into a phase of substantial economic and social
development.
4.        During the first four years of the First Plan, annual economic growth
was close to seven percent. Domestic savings and investment increased considerably,
thus providing the basis for future economic expansion. By 1972, investments,
including those in the rapidly growing oil sector, probably amounted to 20-25
percent of the GNP, nearly half of which were financed from abroad. Present
indications are that economic growth continued at a satisfactory level in 1973.
Prospects for 1974 are also good.
5.        In agriculture there have been sustained efforts to increase food
production, with emphasis on rice. However, the drought in the second half of
1972 led to a setback in food production and a steep increase in prices, despite
a large commitment of Government resources to additional rice imports and subsidies.
Since then, production appears to have recovered, but prices have remained high.
Efforts to expand food production continue to receive high priority and in this
connection the Government plans a large increase in fertilizer imports next year.



- 2 -
6.        The contribution of the oil sector to the economy has increased
very rapidly. Both production and prices rose sharply and, as a result, the
gross value of production increased from a monthly level of US$100 million
at the end of 1972 to US$270 million a year later. On a year-to-year basis,
the value of production increased by about 75 percent in 1973. If prices
stay at present levels, another increase of about 65 percent is likely in
1974. The contribution of the oil sector to the balance of payments and to
Government revenues is growing commensurately.
7.        Even though the oil sector is contributing substantially to the
growth in Government revenue, the overall budgetary situation has remained
tight in 1973/7h. The main reason is that subsidies on rice, which were
designed to restrict further price increases resulting from high international
prices of rice, became a major item in the budget (16 percent of the routine
expenditure). The Government is firmly committed to a balanced budget policy
and the rapid growth of these subsidies has therefore constrained the expansion
of other routine and development expenditures. There is likely to be greater
room for expansion of these expenditures in 1974/75 because oil revenues are
expected to continue to increase while the need for rice subsidies will probably
decline.
8.        After an initial sharp increase in the cost of living towards the end
of 1972- which was clearly related to rice shortages - a second and much more
broadly based wave of price increases started in May/June 1973. Imported
inflation contributed significantly to this development, but this was also
associated with an increase in the money supply. To prevent the reoccurrence
of an inflationary spiral, cautious monetary and fiscal policies are necessary.
9.        Exports have been buoyant due to the high commodity prices as well as
significant volume increases in the extractive sectors. While they were still
below US$1 billion in 1971, they reached an annual level of US$2.4 billion in
the third quarter of 1973 (with oil exports net of imports of oil companies and
factor payments). Imports, however, increased almost as fast, as import prices
went up considerably, though to a lesser extent than export prices, and there
were large volume increases in imports of rice and of investment goods.   Overall,
the current account deficit remained at its earlier annual level of about US$400-
450 million.  However, since net official transfers gradually increased to an
estimated annual level of about US$500 million, and other capital transfers were
nearly as large, net external reserves have increased to about US$900 million,
equal to about fou.r months oi' imports.
Io,       The soft average terms of foreign assistance provided in the context
of r,. Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia (IGGI), and the rescheduling of
pre-i96AJ  RXternal debt obligations (under the 1970 Paris Club agreement with the
Western countr4ies and Japan, and parallel arrangements with several Eastern
&L-opean countries) have kept Indonesia's public debt service ratio relatively
low - estimated at about nine percent of exports for 1973. This ratio is expected
to rise gradually during the 1970s. The capacity to service external debt has,
however, been limited by the size of investment income transfers arising from
foreign investment in oil, hard minerals, forestry and manufacturing, which
amounted to about 18 percent of exports in 1973.



- 3 -
11.       Against this background, the Government has requested foreign
assistance from the IGGI for 1974/75 in the amount of $300 m.llion ftr
program aid (including $100 million for food) and $550 million for project
commitments,   These amounts are, in nominal terms, slightly higher than
is expected to be committed in 1973/74; in real terms they may be slightly
lower. Given the large recent changes in the economic situation of Indonesia -
and particularly the increased contribution of oil - a review of the size,
terms and mix of the different types of aid will be neceSsary. however, such
a review will have to await a fuller assessment of the situation by the
Government, the Bank Group and other foreign donors.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
12.       In order to accelerate the pace of economic development, Indonesia
will require continued substantial external support for rehabilitation and
improvement of infrastructure and expansion of production capabilities in
agriculture, minerals, forestry and manufacturing. It will also require
continued strengthening of the institutions for development planning and the
management of the economy. 1klfare and income distribution, including family
planning, as well as regional development and related patterns of employment
and population movements, also need to be given an important place in Indonesia's
development strategy.
13.       The work at both the Resident Staff in Indonesia and headquarters and
the lending activities of the Bank Group have been oriented toward these
development objectives. The focus of the Eank's economic work in providing
assistance to the Government in the current preparation of Indonesia's Second
Five Year Plan is also along these lines.
lhl.      Consistent with Indonesia's low per capita income, large external
resource requirements, and limited debt servicing capacity, the Bank Group's
lending to Indonesia (aside from IFC investments) has thus far been in the form
of IDA credits. In recognition of the urgent need for institutional reforms,
most IDA-financed projects have been associated with major reorganizations of
existing institutions or the establishment of new ones, and most credits have
included appropriate provision for consultant services.
15.       Priority projects in Indonesia commonly involve a high proportion of
local costs. Even with the substantial program assistance made available
through the IGGI, and Indonesia 's improving savings efforts, it would have been
difficult to meet her need for capital if external capital lenders had lent only
for the iiport component of projects. Moreover, the foreign exchange component



of Drojects in the agric ulture ard social sectors is frequently low anc' local
cumrency financing is necessary if the Association is to increase its involve-
ment -n these important sectors. The Bank Group has therefore covered some
local expenditure in its financing and will continue to do so where the foreign
exchange ccmponent of project expenditure is low.
16.       As of Novamber 30, 1973, Indonesia has received 33 IDA credits
amournting to us$504.o million. The Association accounts for less than two
percent of Indonesia's total outstanding public debt. By 1978 it is expected
to account for less than ten percent of total outstanding debt and less than
one percent of Indonesia's annual debt service obligations.  Annex II contains
sunary statement of IDA credits and IFC investments as of October 31, 1973,
and notes on the execution of on-going IDA projects.
17.       The composition of IDA lending reflects the priorities for rehabilita-
tion and development established by the Government.   In accordance with the
priorities of Indonesia's Five-Year Plans, over 35 percent of IDA lending to date
has been for agriculture. The Association has extended four credits to help
rehabilitate and develop plantations in the Government estates sector. Other
credits for agriculture include four to assist rehabilitation of irrigation
s-vstems and one each for a fisheries project, a seeds multiplication program,
beef cattle development, smallholder rubber development, sugar industry rehabilita-
tion and smallholder tea development.  Industry is of growing importance to the
Indonesian econonVand the Association has assisted in four projects in this
sector. It organized a consortium of leniders to finance a major expansion of
the PUSRI Fertilizer plant, assisted in the reorganization and financing of the
maj or state development bank (BAPINDO), provided financial assistance for
Indonesia's first industrial estate project, and assisted in the establishment
and financing of the Private Development Finance Company of Ihdcnesia (PDFCI).
Other priority sectors to which credits have been extended are power, transporta-
tion, telecomaunications, education and population. In addition, three technical
assistance credits have been made to assist the Government in preparing projects
and formulating appropriate development policies. A fifth irrigation project and
a fisheries project are expected to be presented to the Executive Directors in
the next several months. Projects in telecommunications, tourism, rural works
and urban development are under preparation.
18.       Tne first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in September 1968, and about
half of all credits have been made since June 1971. The program is thus new, and
the undisbursed portion of the credits is relatively large. Virtually every
credit, has been associated with extensive institutional reforms involving, inter
ali e the creation of new project authorities, drafting of new charters, and
ernatme~. of new legislation, all of which have, in most cases, taken much time.
S,everal credits, including the first two for agricultural estates projects, have
6xperienced delays in disbursement because of managerent problems.



PART III - THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Background
19.     Indonesia's need for substantial technical assistance is a reflection,
on the one hand, of pronounced institutional weaknesses of historical origin
and, on the other hand, of the expading demands of a large, complex and
rapidly growing economy. At the time of independence, over 90 percent
of the population was illiterate, and there were very few Indonesians with
either university level training or significant administrative experience. While
educational opportunities expanded rapidly during the 1950s and early 1960s,
the amount of skilled manpower was still far short of requirements. The
development of effective public sector institutions was also impeded by extreme
economic dislocation, lack of adequate development funds, over-staffing of
Government agencies with employees at low salaries and the absence of regularized
personnel policies.
20.     Thu.s, administrative and planning machinery required for carrying out
the urgent rehabilitation and development tasks under the first Five Year Plan
had to be improved, often with substantial technical assistance from
abroad. Since 1969 a number of administrative improvements have been introduced
and key economic agencies strengthened, some with intensive assistance from the
Association. Highly qualified personnel have been appointed to the top positions
in many Government agencies, though further improvements in the quality of middle
and lower level personnel are needed. The increasing size and complexity of the
national economy, however, imposes a serious strain on public administration
which still suffers from inherited weaknesses.  Moreover, a major share of economic
activity in Indonesia is carried on by Government-owned corporations including
agricultural estates, the national oil company (Pertamina), the power company
(PLN), the telecommunications company (PERUMTEL), the principal banks and numerous
industrial, transport and trading enterprises. These companies are progressively
ceing reorganized along commercial lines with improved organization and firancial
structures, more effective accounting and control systems and proper management
standards and incentives.
21.     With the introduction of the economic stabilization program in 1968 and
growing prospects for substantial amounts of foreign assistance, the Government
was also faced with the need to develop quickly a pipeline of well-considered
and prepared projects suitable for international financing. The Government has
actively tackled this problem, but has recognized from the beginning that it
would be necessary to supplement its own efforts with substantial technical
assistance from outside Indonesia. This principle has been fully recognized by
the IGGI.
Technical Assistance provided by the Association
22.     The second credit that the Association made to Indonesia was US$2.0 million



equivalent for technical assistance (Credit No. 127-IND) and this was followed
byv two more technical assistance credits of Us$4.0 million each in September
1LQ70 and December 1971 (Credits No. 216-IND and 275-IND respectively).  As of
October 31, 1973, about US$0.8 million remained uncommitted under these credits,
but the uncommitted balance has been nearly fully earmarked for sub-projects
awaiting the completion of contract formalities. Annex IV of this report lists
the sub-projects for which funds have been committed or earmarked.
23.     The uses of the first three technical assistance credits can be
summarized as follows:
r!y2e of Project                 Amount       Percentae of Total
(Us$ miLlion)      Commitments
Prep3ration of Projects Financed
or to be Financed by Bank Group              5.9                 59
Preparation of Projects Financed
or to be Financed by Others                   o.6                 6
;Advi.sory Services                            0.9                 8
Long-term Studies                              2.5                26
Remaining Contingencies                        0.1                 1
Total          $10.0               100
241     Because of the urgent need in the early years to build up a pipeline of
projects suitable for international financing, almost two-thirds of the amounts
committed from the technical assistance credits have been for pre-investment
work of various kinds. The studies financed under technical assistance credits
hmve contributed to the preparation of projects, for which DA has already
provided `rSM5.5 million in project financing in the fields of highways, power,
e'ucation, irrigation and seeds production.   In addition, studies financed or
soon to be financed under the technical as7istance credits have helped to prepare
_rcJects for which the Association expects in the next year or two to provide
_'f,rter financial assistance amounting to about US$190 million. This includes
p;tiects in the fields where we have previously lent such as irrigation, tele-
comrauaications, fisheries and fertilizer production, and projects in new fields
such as tourism, water sunply, urban improvement, regional development and small-
rhlder assistance through the agrioultural estates.   In addition, the technical
iaD:iitance credits nave been used to prepare and evaluate a few projects which
.re e'xpected to be assistod from other sources of finance, public or private.
.: <om. t exaimle of the letter is assistance provided in the very large Asahan
. izwri p.-oject, t1he financing of which the Goverriment is currently discussing
.7-;'.'.1- fore-1f private investors.  Secondly, the technical assistance credits have
fii- lced a nwuber of long-term studies to assist c.he Ciovernment in formulating
appropriate development policies.  The studies have concentrated on such diverse



-7-
matters as the Government's rice production intensification program,
reorganization of the Government agricultural estate structure, improvement of
the Jakarta property tax system and preparation of a Jakarta Port Masterplan.
Finally, advisory services for special purposes have been provided to BAPPENAS
(the national planining agency) for assistance in the preparation of the Second
Five Year Plan, to the Foreign Investment Board in legal aspects of reviewing
foreign investment proposals and to the Ministry of Finance for improving the
management of state-owned commercial banks.
25.     In addition to the technical assistance credits, the Association has
provided about US$72 million in technical assistance under its proJect credits.
This represents about 15 percent of the total amount of the Association's project
lending to-date.  The proportion of lending under project credits for techrical
assistarnce purposes is not unusually high by Bank-wide standards. Such assistance
has been a common feature of most of our project credits in Indonesia and the
sectoral allocation (agriculture 48 percent, transportation 25 percent, public
utilities 19 percent, education and population 7 percent and industry 1 percent)
is generally in line with the sectoral priorities reflected in total past project
lending. About US$51.0 million of technical assistance provided under project
credits has been directly related to project execution and is beirg used for
management assistance, staff training and detailed engineering. This assistance
has been essential for successful project execution, and has also contributed
significantly to the improvement in the implementation capacity of the project
agencies. Another US$4.0 million of project technical assistance has been
extended to support and improve other project related agencies such as agricultural
marketing boards and research institutions. About US$13.0 million has been made
available under project credits for feasibility studies and preparation of future
projects and US$4.o million for long-term studies of project related matters such
as plans for future institutional improvement, land surveys and analysis of market
prospects.
Technical Assistance Prov-ided by Other Sources
26.      Financing from other technical assistance programs has grown rapidly
during the last several years in support of the expanding requirements of the
Indonesian econony.  In calendar 1972 the estimated commitments were:
Source                           Commitment
Bilateral programs (IGGI) Colombo Plan
and Others                                         4o.o
Asian Development Bank                               0.5
UNDP                                                 7.0
UN Organization Regular Programs (FUNDWI,
UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO, UNESCO, FAO)                  1102
Private Organizations                                7.0
Total    65.7



-8-
27.     The Government has taken care to avoid duplication in the various technical
assistance programs, and informal coordination is also provided through the IGGI
and the close working relations between the Bank Group's Resident Staff and both
the UNDP Resident Representative and foreign embassies. The proposed Fourth
Techn.cal Assistance Credit has been discussed with the UNDP Resident Representative
who aErees that it would constitute an important contribution to Indonesia's
development effort.
28.     Despite the large amounts of technical assistance which have been made
available and the considerable efforts of the Government to improve its own
capabilities, the need for technical assistance is likely to exceed the amounts
available for the purpose at least for the next feiq years.  The bilateral programs
are expected to remain at about present levels over the next several years and
much of the available assistance is closely related to ongoing bilateral projects.
While the bilateral technical assistance programs are of great assistance to the
Government, much of such assistance is tied and therefore considered to be
inappropriate in some cases.  The IJNDP program is nearly fully committed for the
next several years for ongoing or already selected future projects. The Association
will continue to provide substantial amounts of technical assistance under its
project credits, but this will, as it has in the past, focus primarily on mattere
closely related to the projects financed and is therefore inappropriate for broad
institutional support outside the franework of project related agencies.
29.     It has been the Government's policy, with which the Association agrees,
to make use insofar as possible of UNDP and bilateral funds, which are generally
provided as grants, and to reserve IDA technical assistance financing for needs
that cannot be satisfactorily met from other sources. While the technical
assistance credits constitute a relatively small portion of the technical assist-
ance provided to Indonesia, they are particularly useful in certain circumstances
and the proposed Fourth Technical Assistance Credit has high priority in the
YY 1974 lending program. The special utility of the Association's technical
assistance credits stems from the wide range of purposes for which they can be
used; the simplicity and flexibility of the procedures for commitment and
administra-tion of fuands, which permit timely attention to urgent needs that cannot
always be 'oreseen far in advance; the ability of the Resident Staff, in close
a msociation with BAPPENAS, continually to assess priorities and monitor implementa-
tion of sub-pro<~cts; and the international character and high quality of expertise
that cin be recraited.
-n the longer run, DIdonesian capabi'ities and financial resources are
.iirs-2--  improve, ovsr the period o' the Second Five Year Plan, so as to reduce
3oJMtccitv.4 Ily the need for special help of the kind provided under the IDA technical
as.tancc c    ts.  Luring negotiations, the Resident Staff discussed with
~ncv.esian m:thlorities their plans for increasing their own planning and implementa-
tion capability, which wo ld in the longer term allow the Goverment to reduce its
reliance on special technical assistance and to meet technical assistance require-
ments from more usual sources, including its own funds and project credits. We



-9-
expect to keep this matter under continuing review and to assess Indonesia's
future requirements for technical assistance credits on this basis.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Uses of the Propased Credit
31.     The proposed credit of US$5.0 million equivalent would finance a program
of technical assistance to the Indonesian Government which is expected to be
committed over a two year period. A credit and project summary is contained in
Annex III. The preparation of sufficient, well-considered projects for potential
IDA-financing, the primary objective of the financing under the first three
technical assistance credits, has been largely accomplished. Furthermore, IDA
project credits have often provided finance for preparation of future projects in
the same sector and this will reduce the need to rely on the technical assistance
credits for this purpose. In these sectors, Indonesia's own capabilities for
project preparation have also been strengthened, partly through the participation
of local staff in earlier project preparation activities financed under the
previous technical assistance credits.
32.     During the, period of the First Five Year Plan, the Government
was not only successful in building up its project pipeline, but also made
considerable progress in achieving the other major plan objectives of stabilizing
the economy, rehabilitating basic infrastructure and reviving primary exports.
The Government is now able to devote increasing attention to the strengthening of
institutional structures and administrative machinery in order to enhance its
capability for handling the more complex policy and operational problems that are
now emerging. The solution of these problems is crucial to further development
of Indonesia and for this reason it is expected that management studies and
advisory services will absorb a greater share of the assistance prouviied under the
credit now proposed than under the first three technical assistance credits.
33.      Given the change in needs and emphasis described above, the uses foreseen
for the Fourth Technical Assistance Credit may be summarized as follows:
(a) The largest number of sub-projects is expected to involve assistance
in the form of advisory services and staff training for improving
the decision-making and management capabilities of public agencies
and state-owned enterprises, which are not receiving assistance
from project credits;
(b) preparation of specific projects is likely to be less preponderant
than in the past, but some studies will be needed for preparation
of new kinds of priority projects where prior experience and
organization are lacking and for projects requiring finance from
several sources; and



- 10 -
(c) assistance is needed in the analysis of policies and rules
relating 't.o foreign investment, including the terms appropriate
for certain large mining and timber investments that are
urder review.r
3L4.    The Resident Staff discussed the uses of the proposed credit with the
Government in August and SeptIlember 1973 and the provisions of the Credit Agreement
in N'oremrber 1973. While itu is not possible to predict precisely the specif'ic
needs and priorities th-a-t may emerge over the next two years during which the
cred-t is expected to be coimnitted, or the availability and suitability of
techmical assistance f-rcm oThcr sources" some possible requirements that are
reoresentative of the three general categories are described below:
35.     Jnb-ItituticonŽl and Ad-mnistrative Improvement. The Bank Group's Economic
Report (JR7-7:7,-     v      ; £19 r 2, contained a separate annex on Planning and
ma naemen  Issue..., which identified a number of administrative problems and made
a number of specific proposals for improvement. The needs which have been
identified by the report and in subsequent discussions with the Government are:
(a) mpprovement of BAPPENAS' reporting and supervision procedures
to permit systematic mornitoring of progress on development
projects;
(b) strengthening of national personnel admtinistration to establish
consistent policies and standards for the public sexvice, set
up personnel inventories and records and design an appropriate
classification and salary system;
(c) studies of specific state-owned commercial enterprises,which are
in difficulties,to assist the Ministry of Finance in improving
their management and financial procedures;
(d) assistance to improve the organization and operational practices
of the state-owned commercial banks, following up on the initial
fact-finding study already being financed in part from Credit
275-IND (Item 33 in Annex IV);
(e assistance in refor-ming Goverrment budgetary and financial
control proceduires to reduce their rigidity and permit more
efficient execution of development programs;
(f) help in establishing a central procurement information unit to
maintain up-to-datl e information on cofiparative specifications
andi prIces for fo: eign aid-financed goods, and advise Government
procurement agencies, with a view to using tied aid funds, as
well as Indonesia's own resoutrces, more efficiently; and
(g) further assistance in introducing management and financial



- 1I -
control systems on Government agricultural estates as a follow-up
to earlier assistance provided under Credit 135-IND (Item 12 in
Annex iv).
36.     The foregoing list is not exhaustive, nor is it in any sense a firm program
for use of the proposed credit. Some of the potential need may be met from
alternative IGGI sources; for example, a program for improving accountancy standards
and training that was initially formulated and sponsored by the World Bank Group
is likely to be carried out with Canadian aid. Similarly, the IfF has indicated
that it would be willing to consider technical assistance to the state commercial
banks, mentioned in sub-paragraph (d) above, once the scope of the help required
has been determined; and bilateral help may also be available for this purpose.
37.     Sector and Project Preparation Work. The application of IAD technical
assistance for sector and project studIes will be mainly in three categories:
(a) Innovative programs where intensive preparation is crucial to
success. The Jakarta urban development and Bali tourism studies
are examples assisted from previous technical assistance credits.
Possibilities for the future are programs of on population
transmigration to the outer islands, integrated regional
development and promotion of small-scale industries;
(b) large and complex projects where financing from several sources
is likely to be necessary. The success of such joint or parallel
financing depends in large part on carefully integratea project
planning and maintenance of consistent standards, without
significant bias toward any individual supplying country. The
Jakarta Port Master Plan study being financed under Credit 275-
IND (Item 25 in Annex IV) is an example of this type of assistance;
and
(c) small amounts of technical assistance may be required to solve
unforeseen last minute problems in the preparation of specific
projects in order to bring these projects to maturity more
rapidly and efficiently than would otherwise be possible. Recent
examples of such financing are the water supply investigation
near the site of the Bali Tourism Project, consultancy on beach
improvement for the same project and planning assistance in the
final stages of the Jakarta Urban Project.
38.     Private Investment Proposals.   Indonesia's important and varied natural
resource endowment and its generally receptive policy toward foreign investment
have led to the submission of a number of large mineral and timber development
proposals, some of them envisaging finance entirely from abroad, some in joint
ventures with Indonesian public or private enterprises. In the oil sector, the
legal and contractual framework is well established; as regards timber concessions
the situation is much less satisfactory; and the conditions appropriate to the



- 12 -
exploitatiOn of major mineral deposits (other than petroleum) are likely to vary
considerably from one project to another. Assistance being provided under a
previous technical assistance credit for evaluating the Asahan Aluminium proJect
proposals is likely to result in substantial improvement in the benefits to the
economy accruing from the proposed future investment. Assistance has recently
been requested in the formulation of a National Steel Industry Development Plan
and review of various private investment proposals for construction of a basic
steel plant. A few similar requests are likely to be made under the proposed
Fourth Technical Assistance Credit, and I feel confident that the provision of
technical assistance in these matters will be helpful in promoting sound private
investment in Indonesia on tenns mutually acceptable to the Government and the
private investors.
Procedures for Use of the Credit
39.       The proposed credit would follow in all essential respects the procedures
used in the earlier technical assistance credits. The Government of Indonesia
would continue to contribute to the financing of the various technical assistance
activities not less than 15 percent of the costs, in cash or kind, for each sub-
project. As iuder previous credits, BAPPENAS would be the Indonesian agency
responsible for determining technical assistance priorities and approving sub-
project requests, but actual contracts for services would be signed and supervised
by the Indonesian operating agency co2rerned. The Director of the Bank's Resident
Staff would continue to act for the Association in dealing with all matters related
to the selection and execution of sub-projects.
ko.       In all cases, before approving a Government request for commitment under
the credit, the Resident Staff would review with the Government, and where
appropriate with IMDP or other IGGI sources, alternative possibilities of financing
to ensure that these sources are used when they could meet the need with reasonable
effectiveness. We wculd also continue to make all efforts to incorporate funds in
project credits to finance improvements in the implementation capacity of project
agencies and studies for futare lending in related fields, and would use the
technical assistance credit orly when particular needs cannot suitably be financed
under project credits.
P,,RT V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
"1I.      The dr2ft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia
arld the Assoclation, the Recoreaendation of the Cormnittee provided for in Article V,
Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and the text of a
resciiution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. The draft Development Credit Agreement is in the usual form
for this type of project, and its provisions are virtually identical to those of
the Agreement for the Third Technical Assistance Credit (No. 275-IND of December 29,
1971).



- 13 -
42.     I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Development
Credit.

C.   IDA PROJECTS IN EXECUTION   1/
Cr. No. 127   Irrigation Rehabilitation; US$5 MilLion Credit of
September 6, 1966; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This project includes the supply of earth-moving equipment and
machinery to aurment hand labor in rehabilitation work on three irrigation
systems (in Java) and the construction of a fourth (in South Sumnatra). All
the equipment, supplied under the Credit is being well utilized and disbursements
are 98,' of appraisal timetable.  Final completion of the project is expected
to be delayed by about two years in order to complete much additional needed
drainape work, the financing of whichi was not provided for under the Credit.
These addition.al costs will be met by the Government.  The revised economic
rate of return on the project, which was calculated at 50% at appraisal, is
now expecoted to be about 25%.  The closing date has been postponed to
Dee;--ber 31, 1975.
Cr. Nio. 135  Technical Assistance; US$2.0 Million Credit of
December 27, 1978; Closing Date: January31, 1974
The preinvestment studies financed by this credit are progressin-

Cr. No. 165   Eltctricity Distribution:   US'pl5 M+illion Credit of October 25,
1969;  Closing Date:  December 31, 1973
This project is pr-gressing satisfactorily. Government is re-
questing postponement of the Closing Date by about 18 months.
Cr. No. 193   PUSRI Fertilizer 2Spansion:   US$35 Million Credit of June 1S  197L
(as amended May 1973);  Closing Date:  Decomber 3, 9l S
Implementation of this project began nearly a year la-er than an
cipatecd in the appraisal report because of Lhe time required to meet all tiTe
conditions of effectiveness, to select contractors on bid specifications acceptable
to all co-lenders, and to negotiate contracts satisfactory to all parties.   Since
the conclusion of the contract, Part I (construction of' an ammonia-urea fertilizer
complex with an annual capacity of 380,000 metric tons of urea) has progresseo
well and the contractors, spurred on by a penalty-bonus arrangement are sigbtly
ahead of schedule. Fart HI (construction and installation of a natural gas
gathering system and a 65 mile transmission line to the fertilifver comp'lex for
use as feedstock and fuel and to serve other industrial usexs) has also suffered
delays, but the system is now expected to supply gas to the fertilizer plant
when it will be required in February 1974 for p'lant testing.
Fairly firm capital cost estimates show an increase of about 2? 5er-
cent over the appraisal report figures. Part I shows an increase of 17 percent,
due to currency revaluations and changes made necessary as detailed design pro-
gressed and the true composition of the gas supply becarme known.  Part II has
bo-en enlarged to increase transmission of gas, in part to meet the increased
needs of the fertilizer complex but also to supply a greatly increased usage by
Fertariina for its refineries and by power plants. This has increased the cost
of Part II by about 78 percent, but has lowered the cost of gas to the fertilizer
complex since the system throughput has been increased by lO   percent.
Current estimates indicate that these factors will result in increased
foreign exchange costs of US 20.2 million equivalent.   AID, OECF and IDA are con-
tributing US$4.o millioni, u.$4.5 million and US.5.0 million respectively to help
finance the foreign exchange cost overrun. The Government will cover the balance
required to complete both parts of the project.
Despite the capital cost increase, the project has become more re-
munerative.   ne economic rate of return has increased from 14 to 21 percent
because of a faster build-up of sales. Considerably higher world market prices
can now be expected than assumed in the appraisal report.
Cr. No. 194   Agricultural Etates:    US$17 Million Credit of June 15, 197C-
Closing Date:  June 30, 1975
Tnis project was for the rehabilitation of two Governaent-owneo
estate groups in North Sumatra.   The Credit became effective eight months after

s-->-.ure  the del ay res-ltiing fror: unforeseen difficulties in the appointment
c managenentr advi-ors and visiting inspectors.  Delays in development occurred
as oil palm planting material in Lndonesia was found to be genetically unsuitable,
arnd an uniforeseen sharp fall in rubber prices seriously restricted the availability
of self-generated funds.  However, during 1973 a record 3, 200 ha of oil palm will
be planted on PNP VI and the program will be virtually on target.   The 1973 rubber
program was reduced following the advice of the last Supervision Mission as PNP IV
was over-extended;   if the high standards of replanting now being achieved can
be maintained, it should be possible to increase the size of future programs again.
ianag,?ment has imuroved in the field and factory and reasonable
standards are being maintained.  More emphasis is required or. cost control and
Yarnagement nas agreed to take the necessary action.  Solid progress is being ach"ieved
and PN  VI's financial situation has been greatly helped by the present higher
producer prices.  PNP Iv has also made marked  progress during 1973 and is in a
satisfactory financial position.
Cr lqo. 195     Irrioation 9Ehabilitation II:  US$1E8.5 Million Credit of June 15,
1970;  Closing Date:  November 30, 19714
The project includes rehabilitation and drainage works over
186,000 ha.  After a slow start, due to problems with preparation of tender
documents and difficulties in obtaining acceptable bids, work is now proceeding
somewhat better.  Problems of quality and progress still exist and, although
the consultants are tackling these vigorously, the lack of a President-Director
to lead the Authority is a seriouLs problem.  GOI is now considerirng candidates
for this post.  Estimated costs remain within the overall appraisal estimate, but
the project will be one year behind appraisal schedule.
CT. No. 210     Telecommunications:  US$12.8 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
C1osing Date:  June 30 19714
After a slow start, due to procurement difficulties, orders for
al, e       -uipme:t except the tropospheric scatter system have now been placed.  The
majnagement consultants have completed their work but have been retained to imple-
ment the recorrmIendations.  Tnere is a cost overrun of about US$1.0 million, due
mainly to currency realignments.   These matters are being discussed between the
Goverrne.nt, aid the Associ.?iOn o 0to work out appropriate measures.

Cr. NTo. 219    Education:  US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project is about 12 months behind schedule due to delay
in the appointment of the architect but is now progressing satisfactorily.
Four out of five contracts for civil works have been approved by the Govern-
ment and the Association, as also have equipment lists.  The leader of the
team of overseas specialists has arrived and is assisting the training of
the first group of technical teachers for the centers. V;iile disbursemnents
were initially slower than exoected, it is likely that construction of t'he
five centers -zill be conipleted in less time -than originally cstirr.atc  -rd
the final implemerntatio-. would thus be on schedule.
Cr. No. 220     Irrigation Rehabilitati.on III:  JS$TL . 5 ldllion CreW.t c.u
3November 6, 1970;  Cosing Date:  December 31, 197, 
This project covers 202,000 ha and includes rehabiTlitation
and re-introduction of an 0 & M organization in three irrigation systemsLE, two
in Java and one in South Sulawesi.  Ccnstruction remains about two years
behind schedale.  The problems with preparation of contract d3cciments, which
have caused thLis delay, have been overcome and, while no furJIqe: de'a.s are
exTvected, it is unlikel_y that the tirne 'cst could be regained'. 'T_;ere nas
been some increase in overall project costs, and a review is being carried
out to determine the effect of the dollar devaluation on civil w-orks ano
equipment contracts yet to be awarded.  Disbursements are improving to about
52 percent of the leveel estimated at appraisal. Sensitivity tests rwi at
the time of appraisal showed that a two year delay and 15 percent cost over-
rnn would reduce the economic rate of return from 25 percent to 21 percent.
Cr. No. 2s6     Seeds:  US$7.5 laillion Credit of May 1il 1971;  Closing Date:
Septeember 30, 1977
Project implementation is behind schedule due to initial
delays in organization, management and effective procurement.  These problers
are being overcome but, because of procurement delays, inflation, currency
revaluation and design changes in the seed processing plant, a 20 percent
cost increase for the original project proposal became likely. However, recent
studies indicate that the market size for rice seed may be only about half the
original production target. Therefore the latest Supervision Nitission has
recommended reduction of the seed production target ._rom 22,000 tons to 12000
tons per annum in 1977, by which time the need for further development of the
seed industry would have been reviewed. The possibility of such a reduction in
project output was foreseen   at the time of appraisal and provided for in the
Credit Agreement.  Therefore, two subsidiary seed processing centers will not
be constructed and the funds now remaining in the Credit will be adequate to
complete the project. The expected economic benefits of the project remain
substantial with' a rate of return of 59 percent, not including the research
and seed certificatuion components whose benefits are not easily quantifiabiLc.
