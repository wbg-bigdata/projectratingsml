IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
THIRD POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2981-AL)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Third Power Project,
funded by Loan No. 2981 in the amount of US$160 million (revised amount US$159.43 million).
The loan was approved by the Board on June 29, 1988, was signed on November 13, 1989, and
became effective on March 29, 1990. The original closing date of December 31, 1995 was
extended twice, and the loan closed on June 30, 1997. The last disbursement of US$0.57 million
was made on September 3, 1997, and the undisbursed balance of US$23.20 million was
canceled. Cofinancing of US$ 86.5 million was provided by the Eximbank of Japan and the
undisbursed amount of US$11.8 million was canceled.
This ICR was prepared by Messrs. Ren6. Mendonca, Sr. Power Engineer and Ahmed El-
Hamri, Economist of the Infrastructure Development Group, Middle East and North Africa
Region (MNSID). The report was edited by Ms. Deborah Davis and reviewed by Jean-Claude
Villiard, Director, MNSID; Zoubeida Lahdibi-Belk, Sector Leader; and Amir Al-Khafaji, Lead
Operations Specialist, MNSID.
Preparation of the ICR began during a mission carried out by Messrs. Rene Mendonca
and Ahmed El Hamri in July 1997 (see Appendix A: ICR mission Aide-Memoire). It is based on
material in the project files and on the completion report provided by the Borrower. The
Eximbank of Japan was invited to comment on the draft ICR but no comments were received to
date. The Borrower submitted its own evaluation of project's implementation as well as
comments on the draft ICR (see appendix B).






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
THIRD POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2981-AL)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
i.    The Third Power Project (Loan 2981) was approved by the Board on June 29, 1988. The
loan, to assist in the financial strengthening and institutional restructuring of the public power
utility, SONELGAZ, was part of the Bank's strategy to support Algeria's far-reaching program
of public enterprise reform, to improve the efficiency and viability of these corporations. The
project was designed to increase SONELGAZ' capacity to implement the major investments
needed to meet increasing demand by optimizing energy production and improving the quality of
supply. The longer-term goal was to use the reform of SONELGAZ as a model for the reform of
the country's other public enterprises.
Project Objectives and Description
ii.    The main objectives of the project were to:
(a)   restructure and strengthen the financial position of SONELGAZ,
(b)    gradually increase SONELGAZ' autonomy,
(c)    help implement major investments that would help optimize the productivity of the
overall power system, and
(d)   improve the quality of the power supply.
(e)   improve SONELGAZ's' management, planning and engineering capabilities.
iii.   Project components included:
(a)    about 475 km of 220 kV transmission lines to interconnect the new Jijel power station to
the bulk supply system:
(b)   the con-struction/extension of seven 220 kV transformer substations;
(c)   supply of specialized equipment and vehicles to improve SONELGAZ' efficiency;
(d)   studies on power system loss reduction, manpower development, financial management,
and options for power generation, including the combined-cycle technology;
(e)    a training program.
iv.    Evaluation of objectives. The objectives of the project were relevant and has been
properly identified to deal with SONELGAZ reform efforts. However, these objectives were
undermined by the risks inherent to the environment in which SONELGAZ operated.
SONELGAZ's delays in implementing financial restructuring were linked to delays in increasing
tariffs. Other factors, such as the devaluation of the local currency and SONELGAZ's debt
burden, weighed against the complete effectiveness of the project. However, considering the
achievement of the physical components, the partial completion of the studies, the institutional
strengthening undertaken by SONELGAZ, the project can be rated satisfactory (see para. 5 and
6).



ii
Achievement of Objectives
v.    Physical objectives. Overall the project has achieved its physical objectives
satisfactorily, albeit with some delays due mainly to the security situation. Some of the physical
components in the transmission lines and substations works underwent some modifications. All
transmission lines are well on their way to being completed by the end of this year. All
substations necessary to strengthen the transmission network have been completed and are in
operation, except the Ramdane-Djamel substation. These; physical components will improve the
reliability of the transmission network as well as the quality of service to the consumers and help
optimize productivity in Algeria's power system. The supply of specialized equipment and
vehicles to improve SONELGAZ's operational efficiency have been completed and are in
service. The installation of computer hardware and software has improved the planning and
operation of the gas and electricity distribution networks (see paras. 7-9)
vi.   Studies.   Most of the studies have been completed. These studies have allowed
SONELGAZ to streamline and increase the efficiency of its operational activities. Moreover, the
Loss Reduction Study to recommend measures to reduce system losses and the Combined-Cycle
Study to define optimal generation option, including combined-cycle alternative, were
completed. The Central Cash Management Study and the Management Information System
Studies are being completed using SONELGAZ's own funds. These studies should result in a
comprehensive and efficient reorganization of the accounting and financial management function
of SONELGAZ (see para. 10)
vii.   Financial objectives. Financial objectives were partially met. SONELGAZ's financial
performance should improve in the medium to long run but only after full completion of its
restructuring plan, which was not fully achieved under the project. SONELGAZ's revenue
generation is still problematic at best. Important problems still exist with respect to collection of
receivables from public sector enterprises and administrative institutions. Furthermore,
efficiency is still not optimal. SONELGAZ costly operations have undermined its ability to
generate adequate surplus (see para. 11-14).
viii.  The level of the tariffs prevailing during the period 1988-1996 were not appropriate to
recover cost based on economic principles nor were they sufficient to meet.the self-financing
ratio in every year. These increases were not sufficient to improve SONELGAZ's. financial
situation, since they were being eroded by inflation and currency devaluations (see para. 12).
ix.   Institutional objectives.  Achievement of institutional objectives is considered
satisfactory in view of SONELGAZ's efforts to provide technical and financial training to
reinforce its human resources base. Moreover, the autonomy of SONELGAZ was strengthened
through the enactment of its revised statutes approved in 1995. Training conducted under the
project will provide long-term benefits through improved personnel efficiency. Completion of
the Central Cash Management and Management information System Studies should result in
improving the managerial and financial capability of SONELGAZ (see paras. 15-16).
x.    Project costs and financing. The project's estimated cost at appraisal was US$391.2
million, including contingencies, duties and taxes and excluding interest during construction. On
completion in October 31, 1997, the total cost of the project, as revised, is now estimated to be



iii
US$314 million, which is about 20 percent lower than appraisal estimate. Of this, the foreign
cost is now US$136.2 million (out of US$160 million of the Bank loan) and US$74.7 million
(out of US$86.5 million of the Eximbank loan). Savings generated were primarily due to: (a)
appreciation of foreign currencies vis-a-vis the local currency; and (b) lower bid prices than
appraised estimates (see para. 17).
xi.    Project economic performance. The recalculated EIRR is now estimated at 9 percent,
which is higher than the appraisal estimate of 6.3 percent. These estimates were based on key
financial data for the period of 1989-97. This might reflects a relative tariff increase, in addition
to incremental revenues resulting from increased genera,tion and improved transmission
efficiency (i.e., reduced technical losses). The EIRR was recalculated using the methodology
described in the SAR (see para. 18 and Part II, table 9).
Major Factors Affecting the Project
xii.   The project was negatively affected by the security situation, which undermined
implementation, supervision and technical assistance. Project effectiveness was delayed by 18
months at the beginning and further delayed by SONELGAZ's unfamiliarity with the Bank's
procurement guidelines. Inflation and local currency devaluation eroded tariff adjustments and
the debt service of SONELGAZ. These factors have negatively impacted SONELGAZ' efforts
toward financial restructuring (see para. 19).
Bank Performance
xiii.   Overall, the performance of the Bank cmn be rated as satisfactory. During project
preparation of the project, the Bank responded in a timely manner to the Govermment's request
for urgent help. During supervision, the project was supervised on a regular basis, about every 6
months, in spite of the difficult security situation in Algeria. Bank missions gave SONELGAZ
substantial assistance in planning its financial performance and obtaining tariff adjustments.
Visits to construction sites were not possible during the last two years of project implementation
(see para. 20).
Borrower Performance
xiv.   Overall, the performance of SONELGAZ can be rated satisfactory. The implementation
of the physical works by SONELGAZ's technical personnel was efficient. The implementation
of policy issues, and the performance of the Ministry of Energy and SONELGAZ were in
general satisfactory except for delays in implementing tariff adjustments, the Contrat-Plan (not
yet approved by the Government), and SONELGAZ's revised statutes (approved in September
1995) (see para. 21).
Project Sustainability
xv.   The project is likely to be sustainable in the long term given the benefits of its
components. The full benefit of the project will be achieved where most of the transmission and
substations works have been completed and put into service. These works will improve the
reliability of the power system and the quality of service to the consumers. The capacity of the
transmission system will be maintained and most likely extended. Regarding SONELGAZ's
financial position, sustainability of the improvements would be much easier in a low-inflation



iv
environment and small devaluations. Moreover, SONELGAZ, financial performance will be
improved in view of its measures contained in its financial restructuring plan and will start
generating net resources for each year, starting in 1998, which should be consistent with standard
covenanted ratios (see para. 22-23).
Summary of Findings, Future Operation and Key Lessons Learned
xvi.   Project outcome. Overall project assessment is satisfactory and the project is expected
to achieve a reliable, efficient, and well-integrated transmission network in the long term. The
project's recalculated EIRR is satisfactory and reflects increased output, decreased system losses
and tariff increases (see para. 24).
xvii.  Future project operation. Bank's strategy for the sector for further assistance to
Algeria will be targeted towards facilitating restructuring of the sector and developing an
enabling environment for entry of the private sector in power generation. To this end, as part of
its Economic Development Program in the Energy Sector, the Government has declared its
intention to introduce private operators in electricity generation in order to alleviate the large
investment requirement needed in the generation expansion program (see para. 25).
xviii. This project should be continuously monitored in order to ascertain that SONELGAZ
financial performance is in line with covenanted targets. SONELGAZ has agreed to monitor the
project its financial and operational performance as through performance indicators as outlined
in para. 27 and Part II, Table 5.
xix.   Key lessons learned. The main lessons learned are: (a) stronger financial restructuring
measures might have been appropriate during preparation, before Board approval; therefore,
further financial reengineering of the enterprise is still needed so that it will be able to generate
sufficient internal cash to finance its own expansion plan, and to bring its operational and
financial performance in line with that of comparable international utilities; (b) cash generation
as defined under the project showed extreme volatility over the years. A rate-of-return covenant
might have been more appropriate and understandable by all stakeholders, in spite of local
inflation; (c) the Bank might consider providing procurement training before project
effectiveness; (d) the Bank should ensure that follow-up project operation is monitored properly
and that performance indicators are established at the beginning to facilitate evaluation of project
sustainability; (e) project objectives should be linked to overall macroeconomic restructuring
objectives so that sectoral reforms do not represent barriers to industrial enterprises that have
embarked upon a strategy of change; and (f) the Bank's strategy for the sector should focus on
facilitating restructuring of the sector and developing an enabling environment for entry of the
private sector. (see para. 28).



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA
ALGERIA POWER PROJECT
(Loan 2981-ALG)
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement and Evaluation of Objectives
Introduction/Background
1.    There had been two previous power loans since independence. Preparation for a third
loan was suspended in 1982 when the Government failed to take action to address SONELGAZ's
deteriorating financial situation, and there was a lull in contacts until 1985 when preparation of
this project began. The project has focused in particular on the successful implementation of
SONELGAZ's Government-approved financial restructuring program, optimization of electricity
use at power stations and in the transmission network, optimization of investment programs, and
strengthening of SONELGAZ' management and accounting systems.
2.    The Bank loan of US$160 million (revised amount US$159.43 million) was cofmanced -
as a joint financing arrangement - by the Japanese Eximbank with a loan of US$86.5 million
equivalent, with the Bank administering the Japanese loan together with its own financing. The
foreign cost of most components was financed 65 percent by the Bank and 35 percent with
Eximbank of Japan funds.
Project Objectives and Components
3.    At appraisal. The Third Power Project at appraisal had four main objectives: (a) to
restore and strengthen SONELGAZ's financial position through a gradual shift to greater
financial and managerial autonomy; (b) continue implementation of some major investments that
would help to optimize productivity in Algeria's power system; and (c) assist SONELGAZ in its
efforts to improve its management, planning and engineering capabilities and thereby improve
the quality of supply. The proposed project was also expected to (d) provide a vehicle for
dialogue with SONELGAZ and the Government on rationalizing the company's overall
procurement procedures.



2
4.    The project was designed as part of SONELGAZ's least-cost development program for
the period 1988-1995. It involved:
(a) construction of about 475 km of 220 kV transmission lines to interconnect the power
station under construction at Jijel to SONELGAZ's bulk supply system;
(b) construction and/or extension of six 220/60kV substations and one 220/90/30 kV
transformer substation, with total installed capacity of about 2180 MVA;
(c) the supply of specialized equipment and vehicles;
(d) training and supply of devices such as computer software and hardware to strengthen
SONELGAZ's capabilities in network engineering, planning and financial management; and
(e) consulting services to assist SONELGAZ in carrying out various studies for power
system loss reduction, manpower development and financial management systems, and a study
to determine the opportunity for introducing the combined-cycle alternative in SONELGAZ's
future power generation system.
Evaluation of Objectives
5.    Objectives were clearly stated and agreed to by all stakeholders. Compared to later Bank
projects in power sectors of various countries, the objectives of this project may appear to have a
limited scope; however, this project restarted a difficult dialogue after several years of
interruption. The stated objectives appear to be what were acceptable for both parties at the
time. Regarding SONELGAZ' financial performance, the objective/covenant of 15 percent self-
financing appears rather modest, but again, at the time SONELGAZ was in a desperate financial
situation, and even this low target stipulated a demanding change of direction with the tariff
restructuring necessary to reach that objective coming at a high political and economic cost.
Given the high inflation, there was no financial rate-of-return target for SONELGAZ' operations.
Since the early 1980s, the Government has been implementing economic reforms, including
central planning reforms, development of a more autonomous financial system, private sector
promotion and improved mobilization and allocation of resources via pricing reforms. It is
within this context that this project should be evaluated.
6.    Although the financial objectives were relevant, they were beyond SONELGAZ's
capabilities. The gradual approach adopted by the Algerian Government focused on macro
rather than microeconomic reforms. Algerian industry was unproductive (apart from the oil and
gas industry) and needed a complete overhaul, which depended on fundamental institutional and
economic reforms being carried out (which was not the case at the time of project effectiveness).
Access to foreign exchange was constrained and limited, inflation rates were high and public
enterprises (such as SONELGAZ) were structurally inefficient. Industrial structure was not
conducive to growth and institutional behavior (sluggish actions by the Government on the tariff
issue in the case of SONELGAZ) led to poor financial results.

Eximbank of Japan financed components that underwent some modifications. Khemis-Oued Sly
(220 kV, single circuit, 110 km) and Jijel-Ain M'Lila (220 kV, single circuit, 120 km) lines were
deleted and Ramdane Djamel-EI-Hadjar, Zahana-Terga-Ghazaouet and Ouled-Fayed-Beni
Mered lines (total: 262 km) as indicated above were added to the project, which reflected an
increase of 32 km of line. With regards to substation work, Ghelghoum Laid substation was
deleted and replaced by the Oued Athmania substation. These modifications were due mainly to
prevailing security reasons, and alternate works were needed to meet the growing demand; These
modifications were agreed with the Bank. All transmission lines are well on their way to being
completed by the end of this year, except for the El-Mansouriah-Jijel line, which is proceeding
very slowly due to the existing security situation in that location and is expected to be completed



4
by March 1998. All substations necessary to strengthen the transmission network in order to
improve the evacuation of energy have been completed and are in operation, except with the
Ramdan-Djamel substation expected to be commissioned in the first quarter of 1998. This delay
was due because of ground stability problem in the substation, which has been resolved. The
project's rehabilitation/expansion work of the transmission network including substations will
improve the reliability of the transmission network as well as the quality of service to the
consumers and help optimize productivity in Algeria's power system.
9.    The supply of specialized equipment and vehicles to improve SONELGAZ's operational
efficiency have been completed and are in operation. This has contributed in improving
efficiency of SONELGAZ's operation activities as well as the quality of service to the
consumers. Supply of computer hardware and software to strengthen SONELGAZ's capabilities
in network engineering and planning management was completed, and resulted in improving the
planning and operation of the gas and electricity distribution networks.
Studies
10.   Most of the technical studies that SONELGAZ undertook have been (or are being)
completed (see Part II, Table 6). These studies have allowed SONELGAZ to streamline and
increase the efficiency of its operational activities. The Loss reduction Study was completed and
is assisting SONELGAZ in implementing an action plan to reduce power system losses, which
will increase system efficiency. The Combined-Cycle Study was completed and will assist
SONELGAZ in revising its investment program and defining optimal generation option,
including the combined-cycle alternative.   As a result of this study, SONELGAZ has
incorporated combined-cycle power plants in its generation expansion plan and the first one is
planned to be built in Alger-West. The Central Cash Management Study as well as the
Management Information System (MIS) Study to improve the financial and accounting systems
of SONELGAZ are ongoing, albeit with delays. They are being completed using SONELGAZ's
own funds. These studies should result in a comprehensive and efficient reorganization of the
accounting and financial management function of SONELGAZ (a major objective of the
project). SONELGAZ has also benefited from many audits that have helped put in place a viable
financial management system. However, SONELGAZ needs to complete the Manpower
Development Study, which has been delayed due to security reasons, in order to be able to
upgrade its managerial capabilities.
Financial Objectives
11.   The financial objectives were partially achieved. This project was designed to restore
and strengthen SONELGAZ' financial position and improve its operational efficiency with a
gradual shift to greater financial and managerial autonomy. The Bank and the Borrower had
agreed on a comprehensive set of actions that were to be carried out in a timely manner. These
actions specifically included: (a) a gradual increase in the self-financing capability to reach 15
percent by 1993; (b) payments of all arrears due to SONELGAZ by public sector enterprises and
institutions; (c) systematic audits of SONELGAZ' accounts; (d) completion and implementation
of the recommendations of a management and accounting systems study. These actions were
conditional on the Borrower's implementation of a phased and gradual tariff increase, which was
necessary for the project to reach its financial objectives.



5
Tariffs
12.    SONELGAZ had to set up a tariff adjustment policy concurrent with the project's
financial objectives. However, its status as an EPIC (enterprise publique a caractere industriel
et commercial) did not allow it to act independently from the public institutions that oversaw and
controlled its operations and management. Within the context of Algeria, tariffs reflect
socioeconomic policies and decisions, and covenanted tariff increases could not be implemented
outside this framework. In effect, project effectiveness was delayed by 18 months because of
Government delays on the 10 percent tariff increase, which seriously affected project
implementation and SONELGAZ's fnancial performance'. A lifeline tariff (5O0kWh/year) was
introduced by SONELGAZ at the suggestion of the Bank in order to protect the low-income
consumers. The first tariff increase of about 10 percent was implemented in March 1991 and did
not much improve SONELGAZ's financial situation. The macroeconomic context was not
conducive to successive increases and the Government was not ready for larger increases
because of the sociopolitical climate that prevailed in Algeria starting in the second half of 1991.
Other increases were enacted  in  1992  and  19932 but were not sufficient to  improve
SONELGAZ's financial situation, since they were being eroded by inflation and currency
devaluation3. The Bank did, however, request further financial restructuring and tariff measures
from the GOA to improve SONELGAZ's internal cash generation ratios for the period 1994-964.
Overall tariffs are progressing toward their economic levels. High voltage tariffs are already at
their economic level (107 percent in 1997), while medium voltage and low voltage tariffs will
reach their economic levels by 1998 and 2000 respectively.

* Preliminary figures for 1996 and 1997.
This mediocre financial performance (in 1989) was due mainly to a one year delay in tariff increase.
SONELGAZ also incurred substantial foreign exchange losses on debt service. Furthermore, there was a
lack of significant improvement in accounts receivable and in the agreed-upon cost reduction program.
2 Tariff increases of 55 percent for 1992 were decided in April, of which 2 steps of 15-18 percent
(depending on voltage levels) and were implemented as planned in April and June. Similar adjustments
followed in September 1992.
3 Average tariffs were still below targets and were offset by inflation rates (which were higher than
estimated).
4 New tariffs were promulgated in September 1994 to take effect during the second half of 1994 and with
automatic adjustments for 1995.

13.   Overall financial performance. SONELGAZTs revenue generation is still problematic
at best. Important problems still exist with respect to collection of receivables from public sector
enterprises and administrative institutions. Billing collection, for the period 1989-97, was not
consistent with the 2-month covenanted target of the project agreement (see table 4).
Furthermore, efficiency is still not optimal. In effect, excessive expenditures, representing an
average of 90 percent of total sales (for 1989-97) have undermined SONELGAZ's ability to
generate adequate surplus.  In spite of costly debt conversion and restructuring, debt
management needs to be improved. The debt service ratio has not reached the agreed-upon
objective (1.3 times). In spite of financial adjustment measures, internal cash generation
remains below the covenanted 15 percent. However, this ratio did improve from negative 5
percent in 1986) to 7.7 percent in 1996. This financial performance is due to SONELGAZ's
inability to mobilize adequate revenues (its cash flow is negative) to reach the agreed-upon
targets.
14.   As of 1995 SONELGAZ's financial situation was improving (see table 3) but not to the
extent of achieving project objectives. All corrective measures have to be perceived within a
constraining internal (managerial) and external (regulatory and economic) environment that
5
SONELGAZ had to contend with. In spite of debt buy-back operations , at about DA 11.4
billion in 1992, DA 8 billion in 1995 and DA 8,5 billion in 1996, and the conversion of BAD
(Banque Algerienne de Developpement) debt6, its ratio of equity over net assets remained very
low (0.23 in 1995). Furthermore, SONELGAZ embarked upon a strategy of settling accounts
with its public sector consumers. Given that tariffs were lagging behind revenue requirements, it
was difficult for SONELGAZ to secure enough internal cash to finance its own operations. Its
activities were highly leveraged and debt levels were excessive (representing 75 percent of
liabilities in 1995). External debt represented 45 percent of total debt and 33 percent of total
capital. Total debt service represented 72.6 percent of income from total sales, however debt
service ratio did improve considerably (from -0.19 in 1989 to 1.21 in 1996). Receivables have
also improved from 3.9 months of billing in 1989 to 2.6 in 1996. Cash flow management is also
improving as measures to collect arrears due to SONELGAZ are producing positive results.
Financial performance indicators for 1996 show that SONELGAZ is pursuing a cautious strategy
which will ultimately pay off in the period 1998-2001. However, investment financing remains a
problem for the period after 2001, when considerable capital outlays will be needed, in particular
for the renovation and expansion of generation capacity.
SONELGAZ had to readjust its capital and financial structure because of debt absorption requirements.
6 In 1996, delivering on its commitments to financial restructuring, SONELGAZ converted DA 38.9
billion in debt owed to the Algerian Development Bank (BAD).

Institutional Objectives
15.     Achievement  of  institutional  objectives  is  considered  satisfactory  in  view   of
SONELGAZ's efforts to provide technical and financial training to reinforce its human resources
base. Furthermore, SONELGAZ's revised status in 1995 has increased its autonomy particularly
in terms of decision making vis-a-vis the Ministry of Energy regarding its investment expansion
program, its internal structural reorganization and appointment of its high level management.
Annual programs of trainees, mostly engineers, were sent to foreign school to be trained mainly
in the operation of power plants and telecommunications. This training program was approved
by the Bank and lasted for a period of 5 years, and resulted in improving SONELGAZ's
operational activities.
16.     Over several years, the annual audits of SONELGAZ's accounts and systems by an
association of a foreign and an Algerian audit firm were successful in improving and
strengthening SONELGAZ's systems. Unfortunately, these missions have come to a halt
because of the security situation.    Completion of the Central Cash Management and the
Management and Information System Studies should result in improving the managerial and
financial capability of SONELGAZ.

Project Costs and Financing
17.   Based on 1987 prices, the project's estimated cost at appraisal was US$391.2 million,
including contingencies, duties and taxes and excluding interest during construction. Of this, the
foreign cost was estimated at US$245.3 million, with financing from the Bank (US$160 million)
and the Eximbank of Japan (US$86.5 million), excluding the Govenmnent's contribution. On
completion in October 31, 1997, the total cost of the project, as revised, is now estimated to be
US$314 million, which is about 20 percent lower than appraisal estimate. Of this, the foreign
cost is now US$136.2 million (out of US$160 million of the Bank loan) and US$74.7 million
(out of US$86.5 million of Eximbank of Japan loan). However, it should be noted that appraisal
and current estimates are not comparable as some physical components have been changed as
explained above (para. 8). Furthermore, appraisal estimates did not include SONELGAZ
administration and local engineering expenses. Savings generated were primarily due to: (a)
appreciation of foreign currencies vis-a-vis the local currency; and (b) lower bid prices than
appraised estimates. Original and final project costs are shown in Part II, Table 7 and 8.
Project Economic Performance
18.   The project was part of SONELGAZ's least-cost expansion program, and during
appraisal the economic rate of return (EIRR) on SONELGAZ's investment program for
generation, transmission and distribution for the period 1988-1995 was estimated at 6.3 percent
With actual data for the period 1989-1996, the EIRR is now estimated at 9 percent, which is
somewhat higher than the appraisal estimate. These estimations are based on preliminary
(unaudited) accounting and financial figures. (see Part I, Table 9). EIRR recalculations, for
project such as this one, are somewhat subjective. The relatively higher EIRR takes into account
Sonelgaz's overall performance during the period 1989-97 and should only be interpreted within
that context..
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
19.   The following factors affected the project: (a) The security situation in Algeria had an
impact on physical implementation of certain high-voltage lines, and on the implementation of
several studies and technical assistance (i.e., the annual audits were substantially reduced in
scope, as were the technical assistance to improve SONELGAZ's accounting and financial
systems and the Central Cash Management Study); (b)Project effectiveness was delayed by 18
months, resulting in delay of project implementation; (c)Delays were experienced at the start of
the project by SONELGAZ due to unfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement guidelines; (d)
Tariffs were eroded by inflation and therefore needed to be much higher in order to achieve
increases in real terms. Local successive currency devaluations have undermined the ability of
SONELGAZ to carryout its financial restructuring. Most of all, debt service and exchange losses
related to the sizable foreign currency debt have affected SONELGAZ in a way not anticipated
during project preparation.
D. Bank Performance
20.   Overall, the performance of the Bank can be rated as satisfactory. During project
preparation of the project, the Bank responded in a timely manner to the government's request
for urgent assistance. During supervision, the project was supervised on a regular basis, about



9
every 6 months, in spite of the difficult security situation in Algeria. Bank missions gave
SONELGAZ substantial assistance in planning its financial performance and obtaining tariff
adjustments. Visits to construction sites were not possible during the last two years of project
implementation because of security situation. The overall procurement process was satisfactory,
except for US$600,000 canceled for misprocurement, because of disagreement on a contract
award.
E. Borrower Performance
21.    Overall, the performance of SONELGAZ can be rated satisfactory. The implementation
of the physical works by SONELGAZ's technical personnel was efficient, as was the
performance of the financial department. Furthermore, concerning the implementation of policy
issues, the performance of the Ministry of Energy and SONELGAZ is in general satisfactory,
except for delays in tariff adjustments, the Contrat-plan (not yet approved by the Government),
and SONELGAZ's revised statutes (approved in September 1995). However, it should be noted
that some procurement problems were experienced at the start of the project due to
SONELGAZ's unfamiliarity with Bank procurement guidelines.
F. Assessment of Project Outcome and Sustainability
Project Sustainability
22.   The project is likely to be sustainable in the long run given the benefits of its
components. In fact, some benefit of the project has been achieved in the case of the
transmission and substations works that have been completed and put into service during the last
2 years. Performance of the physical components should not be a problem. A higher rate of
evacuation of energy was achieved where transmission lines and transformers are in operation.
The capacity of the transmission system will be maintained and most likely extended.
23.    Regarding SONELGAZ's financial position, sustainability of the improvements would
be much easier in a low-inflation environment and with only a few small devaluations, because
fewer tariff adjustments would be needed. Furthermore, SONELGAZ's financial position will be
improved because of the current implementation of its financial restructuring program.
SONELGAZ will start generating net resources for each year, starting 1998, that should be
consistent with the covenanted cash generation ratio and adequate to service its debt.
Project Outcome
24.    Overall project outcome can be considered satisfactory.  Implementation has been
satisfactory and it is more than likely that the project will, in the long run, achieve a well
integrated transmission network, resulting in reduced technical losses, increased system
reliability and operational efficiency. Training conducted under the project will also provide
long-term benefits through improved personnel efficiency. The recalculated EIRR of 9 percent
reflects a higher tariff increase than anticipated, as well as incremental revenues resulting from
increased generation and improved transmission efficiency (i.e., reduced technical losses).



10
G. Future Project Operation
25.   Bank's strategy for the sector for further assistance to Algeria will be targeted towards
facilitating restructuring of the sector and developing an enabling environment for entry of the
private sector in power generation. Several measures to be taken by the government and
SONELGAZ in the areas of sector reforms, commercialization/corporatization of SONELGAZ
(including further financial restructuring, spin-off and divestiture of its external activities,
increased managerial and operational efficiency) and sector monitoring and evaluation may
reflect a satisfactory plan for proposed Power IV Project. On sector reforn and under the
Ministry of Energy and SONELGAZ supervision, a Study on the restructuring of the power
sector is being prepared by an International Consultant. The recommendations of this study will
lay-down the policy framework for the proposed Power IV Project. The preliminary
recommendations of the study is expected to be completed by December 1997.
26.   As part of the Government's Economic Development Program in the Energy Sector, the
Government has declared its intention to introduce private operators in electricity generation in
order to alleviate the large investment requirement needed in the generation expansion program,
and to that effect, intends to revise its electricity law.
27.   The Bank should continue monitoring SONELGAZ's financial performance until its in
line with international standards. SONELGAZ's main indicators of success for its future
operation remain the same as its current ones: minimization of losses, achieving high level of
reliability, and more efficient management of its accounts receivable. SONELGAZ has agreed to
monitor the project, its financial and operational performance through performance indicators as
outlined in Part II, Table 5. Future operation will rely on SONELGAZ ability to carry out and
complete the Government sector reform and strategy program.
H. Key Lessons Learned
28.   Major project delays were probably unavoidable given the prevailing security situation.
The main lessons learned are:
(a)    Cash generation as defined under the project showed extreme volatility over the
years. A rate-of-return covenant might have been more objective and understandable by all
stakeholders, in spite of local inflation.
(b)    Stronger financial restructuring measures might have been appropriate during
preparation, before Board approval. It is necessary to have a financial management structure
conducive to efficient resource allocation and financial planning before project implementation.
SONELGAZ had no hedging capability to deal with excessive foreign exchange losses.
(c)    Training to the Borrower on Bank procurement guidelines should have been
provided in order to improve the procurement process.
(d)    If adequate, tariff levels commensurate with inflation, and structure or sector
policy reforms are necessary. They should be implemented before loan effectiveness, given the
difficulties of achieving such adjustments subsequently.



11
(e)   In order to ensure monitoring of project sustainability, the Bank should offer
assistance to the Borrower to implement a system of key performance indicators (for
implementation and development objectives) to follow-up on project operation.
(f)    Complete ownership of the project by the implementing agencies should be
assured from the outset in order to achieve better project performance. SONELGAZ's statutes
(EPIC) does not permit actions to be taken independently from Government stakeholders.
(g)   A strategy of pursuing sector reforms, including corporatization of SONELGAZ,
the establishment of independent regulation and the pursuit pf private sector investors, perhaps
initially for electricity generation to alleviate large investment requirement, would likely have
had far more success.

Troisieme Projet d'Electricite (pret No.2981-Alg) - Mission d'Achevement
Quatrieme Projet d'Electricite - Mission de Pr6paration
Assistance Technique - Projet Solaire PV (FEM) et don IDF
DU 13 AU 26 JUIN 1997
AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.          Une mission de la Banque Mondiale composee de Messrs. Rene
Mendon,a et Ahmed El-Hamri a eu des reunions avec les representants de la Sonelgaz du
13 au 26 juin 1997 a la residence El-Mithak - Alger pour superviser et preparer le rapport
d'achevement du troisieme projet d'electricite dans le cadre de la cl6ture du pret et suivre
la preparation du quatrieme projet d'electricite et du projet solaire photovoltaique (Fond
de 1'environnement Mondiale - FEM). En outre les possibilites d'utiliser des dons IDF
ont ete enumrn&es. En ce qui concerne le cofinancement (financement conjoint:
65%/35%) assure par l'Eximbank du Japon, celui-ci sera cl6tur6 selon les accords en
Octobre 1997.
2.          La mission tient a remercier vivement les representants de la Sonelgaz
pour leur chaleureux accueil et leur collaboration efficace. Le present aide-memoire
resume les principaux sujets discutes et les accords conclus lors de cette mission que la
Banque confirmera par lettre officielle, une fois la mission rentree a Washington. La liste
de personnes rencontrees est presentee en Annexe 1.
A. Achevement du Troisieme Projet d'Electricite:
Introduction
3.          La mission a confirme aux representants de la Sonelgaz que, dans le cadre
des directives et accords des prets de la Banque Mondiale, les "agences" beneficiant des
emprunts, ont la responsabilite de preparer, apres une cl6ture du pret, un rapport
d'achevement du projet conjointement avec la Banque. Le rapport de l'emprunteur
constitue la dernire etape du suivi du troisieme projet d'electricite. I1 devrait etre
pr6pare par 1'entreprise et soumis a la Banque dans un delai de six mois apres la cl6ture
du pret, c'est a dire, le 31 d6cembre 1997. La mission a recommande a Sonelgaz de saisir
l'opportunite pour faire une evaluation retrospective du projet qui vient de s'achever et
presenter son point de vue dans le but de determiner l'impact du projet sur la performance
des activites de Sonelgaz et de preciser dans quelle mesure le projet a atteint ses objectifs
ainsi que de s'exprimer librement sur la qualite de l'action de la Banque. La Banque de
son cote, preparera un rapport d'achevement du projet dans lequel seront inclus ces
commentaires. II sera tenu compte dans ce rapport des commentaires de 1'emprunteur qui



28
seront annexes dans le rapport final d'achevement. Le rapport sera transmis aux
membres du Conseil d'Administration de la Banque.
4.           La  Sonelgaz  s'est engagee  A  preparer un  rapport preliminaire
d'ach&vement et de le transmettre A la Banque avant la fin juillet 1997. Le rapport
d'achevement definitif sera transmis par Sonelgaz A la Banque avant la fin Septembre
1997. Ce rapport devrait contenir une partie analytique d'environ 10 pages ainsi que des
annexes detaillees se rapportant aux objectifs realis6s. La mission a suggere a la
Sonelgaz que ce rapport contienne en outre l'analyse retrospective du projet, le point sur
les realisations physiques, des problemes rencontres dans la passation des marches ainsi
que sur les decaissements du pret par rapport aux objectifs envisages initialement (tel que
presentes en Annexe 2). A cet effet, la Banque a remis A Sonelgaz un prototype de
rapport d'achevement fait par d'autres emprunteurs.

5. Obiectifs du projet. Les objectifs du projet tels qu'ils ont ete defini par le rapport
d'evaluation initiale sont les suivants:
a). assainir et renforcer la situation financiere de la Sonelgaz A travers un plan de
redressement
b). permettre A l'entreprise de continuer l'execution des investissements cles de
l'entreprise dont l'impact serait de renforcer et d'ameliorer le systeme energetique du
pays, et d'optimiser la productivite des investissements courants dans le secteur
dlectricite.
c). ameliorer et renforcer la qualite du service de l'offre d'energie et sa fiabilite.
Ces objectifs representent, pour la Sonelgaz, un aspect important de son plan de
developpement. A l'effet de concretiser ces objectifs, les composantes retenues sont
decrites dans ce qui suit:
6. Description du projet.
a). Construction de 487 km de lignes de transport de 220 kV
b). Construction et/ou extension de sept (07) poste de transformation (220/60 kV; 2180
MVA)
c). Acquisition d'equipement et de vehicules specialises pour ameliorer l'efficacite
operationnelle de la Sonelgaz.
d). Formation et acquisition de materiel informatique et de logiciels
e). Etablissement de services-conseil ingenierie, pour des etudes sur la reduction des
pertes, sur le developpement des ressources humaines, sur la mise en place des systemes
informatique et financier, et sur l'analyse optimale technico-economique des diff6rents
types de production de l'energie electrique.
7. Obiectifs phvsigues. La realisation des objectifs physiques du projet sera achevee en
totalite a l'exception des deux lignes de transport (Jijel/Mansouriah/El-Kseur) et de la
fourniture des postes int6rieurs. Sur un total de US$245,3 millions (prets Banque/Exim



29
bank), A fin Mai 1997, il resterait en solde sur tous les contrats, US$31,5 millions. Sur ce
total, US$14,6 millions sont prevus pour etre decaisses avant le 31 Octobre 1997, US$9,5
millions sont A resilier pour fin de contrat et US$7,4 millions concemant le contrat
d'acquisition des equipements pour postes interieurs seront A decaisser en dehors de la
couverture financiere de Banque/Exim bank du Japon pour parachever le Projet.
8. Objectifs financiers. L'actualisation des donnees du modele financier de l'entreprise
n'etant pas completee, cette evaluation prends en consideration les chiffres comptables
r6els pour 1994-95 et preliminaires pour 1996. De ce fait, les tendances financieres du
modele ne seront verifiables qu'apres l'audit des comptes de 1996. Donc, cette evaluation
tient compte de deux situations. Une evaluation qui est representative des donnees du
modele d'analyse financiere (base sur les tendances du modele financier de l'entreprise),
et la seconde qui est basee sur les donnees comptables reelles telles qu'elles figurent dans
les comptes audites de 1995 et 96. Par rapport A l'objectif d'autofinancement de 15%,
Sonelgaz a atteint une capacite de fmancement de 22% compte non tenu de la
rdevaluation des immobilisations et de celle de la dette devise. Le ratio de couverture du
service de la dette a atteint, A fin 1996, 1.2 sur un objectif de 1.3. Le recouvrement des
creances clients s'est sensiblement ameliore, et a atteint 2.6 mois du chiffre d'affaires sur
un objectif de 2 mois. Dans ce contexte, la situation financiere de Sonelgaz s'est
amnelioree au vu de sa performance etalee sur les annees 1994-96. Au vu du plan de
redressement, cette amelioration continuera dans les moyen et long termes.
9. Indicateurs cls de perfonnance du prolet.   La Sonelgaz utilise un ensemble
d'indicateurs techniques et de gestion qui permettent d'evaluer sa performance. A titre
indicatif, les indicateurs cles de performance presentes dans l'Annexe 3 seront etudies,
completes eventuellement et utilises par la Sonelgaz pour faire le suivi de performance
futur des activites de la Sonelgaz.
10. Renseignements et donnees com=ldmentaires. Les renseignements et les donnees
statistiques de la Sonelgaz qui n'ont pas ete delivres A la mission seront envoyes A la
Banque Mondiale par courrier au plus tard A la fm juillet 1997 conformement A l'Annexe
2. Neanmoins, quelque documents et donnees ont ete dejA remis a la mission.
B. Preparation du Ouatrieme Projet d'Electricite.
11. Un expose sur le 4eme projet a ete fait par la Sonelgaz. I1 a permis d'actualiser
les aspects techniques et financiers lies au reseau de transport et des BCC. Les autres
volets du projet demeurant inchanges. iA est entendu que les moyens d'exploitation et les
aspects formation/etudes seront definis ulterieurement.
La consistance physique du projet se presente comme suit:
- Reseau HT: 951 kms et 18 postes HT
- Reseau Distribution: 9400 kms MT/BT et 4800 postes plus
equipements TST.
- (02) BCC A Oran et Constantine

Le cofit du projet s'etablit A 623 millions de dollars dont 290 millions de dollars en
devises et 332 millions de dollars en monnaie locale pour une parit6 de I $US=60 DA.
Ce cofit de base inclue une provision pour imprevus physique et financier.
12.   Etude Institutionnelle. La Banque a rappele la saisine du Ministere de l'Energie
et des Mines dans sa correspondance du 28 mai 1997 et la reponse qu'elle y a apporte.
Elle confirme que les resultats et les recommnandations de cette etude permettront entre
autre de proposer et de definir une politique strategique A court terme du secteur ainsi que
les parametres institutionnels sur lesquels sera adosse le Quatrieme Projet d'Electricite.
Selon les informations dont dispose la Banque, la phase une "Recommandations des
options institutionnelles du secteur electrique" serait probablement finalisee a fin
septembre 1997. En attendant les resultats de l'etude et la strategie qui sera definie, la
Banque en liaison avec la Sonelgaz, continuera A finaliser les contours du Quatrieme
Projet d'Electricite en vu de l'evaluer si possible avant la fin de l'annee 1997. Elle
souhaite A cet effet, recevoir l'etude technico-economique definitive de Sonelgaz avant la
fin Septembre 1997.
C. Activit6s - Assistance Technique.
13.   Projet Solaire PhotovoltaYque - FEM. Le dossier relatif au projet solaire PV a ete
revu avec le Directeur Recherche et Developpement de Sonelgaz. Il a ete prevu de
remanier le document du projet pour tenir compte des remarques et eclaircissements qui
ont eu lieu durant la reuni on. Les documents (PDF Block A et le document de
conception du projet) seront transmis par Sonelgaz a la Banque a la mi-juillet 1997.
14.   Don sur le dveloppement institutionnelle (IDF grant). Un expose sur la
possibilite de disposer du don IDF a et6 fait par la mission. Ce don porte sur le
developpement institutionnel et pourrait etre utilise pour l'amelioration des economies
d'energie, l'externalisation et/ou l'essaimage, et les aspects de dossiers d'appels d'offres
touchant a la production independante privee.
Les enveloppes par projet sont au maximum US$500.000 par activite A mobiliser au plus
sur deux annees, sur la base de fiche de projet (requ8te) a proposer par le beneficiaire A la
Banque.
A ce titre, la Sonelgaz transmettra une requete a la Banque relative A l'amelioration de ses
capacites de management (formation, organisation, etc..)
II est mentionne que ces projets pourraient etre finances par des dons car non rentables.

4. LUs obiectifs instittionneJ (firciers) : Ics rcsultats du projet onE penmis d'andliorer
I'atonomie financiere et dc gestion de Sonelgaz. Danm ce sens, il y a licu dc noter le
passage de Sonelgaz I l'autonomic en tant qu'Etablisscment Public A caracLere Indusriel et
CommerciaL
L'autofinancement net pour 1'ann6e 1996 (LtnanL compte des fonds de roulement) est de
7.7 %, ce qui est inf6rieur par rapport a l'objectif financier (1 5 %) du rapport initial
d'6valuation. Pour l'annee 1997, le chiffre d'affaires privisionnel st det 35,5 Millions de DA,
et le rdsulmt net scrait encorr nc5gatif ( - 2,1 miliards de DA). L'auLorinancement est 6vaIu6 
5,2 % (ratio d'autofinancement prdvu de 15 %). T.a situation des cr6ances clients: & la fin
1996, les crdances exigibles sonE passees A. 10,5 milliards de DA, eL le total des cr6ances la 1
mliards, cc qui repr6sente. 2,6 mois du chiffrc d'affaircs (en neue progression vets l'objectif
de 2 mois).
S. Tarifs de l1ectricit6: Pendant la periode dii pre, Sonelgaz a procdcd I un important
ajustementr taifair I travcrs diffdrants augmentations au cours des anndes 1990,1991,
1994, 1995, 1996 et 1997. II a &  introduit 6gralement pour la basse tnsion une tranche &
tarif social a destination des faibles m6nages. L'auginenmton cffcctive du tarif moyen pour
1'6lecticit6 a 6td de 34 % pour I'anndc 1996, ct cc par rappon . 1995 (ce prix moyen
reprdsente actuellement 67,8 % du COu'L dcnomique qui est de 231,63 cDA/KWH). LA,
tarifs de haut: tension ont atteint le couir 6conoomiqui de 115 cDA/KWH, Landis que le tarif
de moyenne tension n'atteindra son coit 6conomique qu'en 1998. Les coats .conomiques
de la basse tension ne seront atEeints qu'apr&s I'an 2000.
6. CoOt dc financemcnt du proict: le projer a 6eL achevy I un cout de 313,73 millions de USD,
soit 20 % en dessous de l'esrmadon de 391,20 millions de U SD etablic au moment de
l'evaluation. Cette baisse par rapport au montant initial s'explique par:
I. Pour la partie devises (pr6vu: 246,5 millions de USD, r6d: 245,28 milons de USD):
- l la proceduie suivi pour la passation des marchfs par voie d'appel d'offres

de lPavancement physique du projet ii y a lieu de noter que les chantiers pour la
construcdon et l'installation ouverts vcrs la fin de l'annde 1992, onL connus un ccrtain
recard du notamment aux prmvdures administatives, A l'indisponibi1itd des mat6Iiaux de
construction sur le marehd national or au retuard de finalisation des dmdrs d'exdcution. U
y a licu de citer dgalcment les retards due 0. des imprdvus d'ordre Lechnique el que le cas
du poste 220) KV de Ramdanc Djamcl dont la naLure du terrain n6cessita des emdes et

notanmment sur les chantiers lignes et postes en raison de la conjoncwre sdcuritairc
defavorable d'une part eE Ics dirricult6s d'acces fI cerrains teaiIns d'autre part.
8. La passation des Mnarch& de roumiLures ct serviccs : Les explications et ddfmiicons des
diff6rents lots et la presentaton de la prooddure de passation des march6s pour chaque lot
ont permis aux agents de Sonelgaz de bien grer cette operation dds lc debur sachant
dgaleement que Ic cahier des charges type a dit etab1i selon le mod6le de la Banque lors dc
1'evaluacion du projcL Dans ce cadre, le programmc d'achat des Equipements et mWz6riel
s'est bien ddrould ainsi quc Ie choix des entrepreneurs pour la rtalisadon des ouvrages e le
choix des consultants pour les dtudes.

1= Principales lesons tdr6es
16. A travers la pr6paration et la rdaIisalion du projet plusieurs legons ont di tirdes et que
nous citons ci-apr6s:
* - Une meilleure coordinaiion doit 6tre 6tabli cntrc les diff6rentes unites concemres par la
r6alisation ct 1'cxdcution du projet A wavers la constliution d'unc cclule de suivi du Projel
pilote par un chef de projet et compos6e d'un rcprisentanT de chaque unite et qui aura
pour mission le suivi de tous lcs aspects du proje, la proposiLion de solutnos adequates I
tout probl2me dventuel et la r6daccion d' un rapport priodique de suivi du projet pour les
