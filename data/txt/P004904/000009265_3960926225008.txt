MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$160 MILLION
TO THE SOCIETE NATIONALE DE L'ELECTRICITE ET DU GAZ (SONELGAZ)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A THIRD POWER PROJECT
1.         The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Societe Nationale de l'Electricite et du Gaz (SONELG&'Z) in the amount of
US$160 million equivalent is submitted for apprcval. The proposed loan would
be repayable over 15 years with five years of grace at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate and would help finance the proposed Third Power
Project. The project would be co-financed by Eximbank of Japan for US$86.5
million equivalent.
2.         Background:   Hydrocarbon-related products account for 44% of
Algeria's industrial output, provide over 90Z of total current foreign
exchange earnings, and produce 43% of Government budget revenues. Increased
internaticnal petroleum prices contributed to a healthy real GDP growth of
7.4% per year from 1973 to 1980 and 5.02 per year from 1980 to 1985. However,
GDP fell by 0.4% in 1986 as a result of the sharp drop in international oil
prices at the beginning of the year, and increased by only 2X in 1987.
Despite the recent lower economic growth, electricity sales continue to grow
rapidly (8.72 in 1986) because of the implementation of an ambitious
industrial and national electrification program.  Since electricity supply is
very capital inLensive, lar6e investments are needed to satisfy the growing
demand.
3.         Rationale for IBRD Involvement:   The Bank made two loans to
Algeria for the power subsector during the 1970s.  Preparation for a third
loan was suspended in 1982 when the Government failed to take actions to
address SONELGAZ's deteriorating financial situation, and Algeria continued to
use procurement procedures conflicting with the Bank's procurement
guidelines. Contacts were renewed in 1985 after the Bank received indications
that (a) the Government was interested in renewed Bank lending for the power
subsector; (b) Bank procurement procedures would be used on Bank-financed
projects; and (c) actions were being considered to improve the finances of
SONELGAZ. Preparation of the Third Power project was then resumed and it was
agreed that the proposed operation would concentrate on one key policy issue:
the need for SONELGAZ to achieve financial viability within a r3asonable time
frame.
4.         Over the last year, the Government of Algeria has embarked on a far
reaching program of financial and institutional reforms to improve overall
public enterprise efficiency and financial viability.  SONELGAZ is one of the
largest and mort important public enterprises and the proposed project would
be part of this overall effort to improve the public sector.  The Bank's
contribution to the success of SONELGAZ's financial and institutional



restructuring will have both direct benefits for the energy sector and
indirect demonstration effects for the public enterorise sector as a whole.
Moreover, the decrease in oil prices has reduced the Government's ability to
finance public investment from internal resources ane increased its cost of
borrowing from commercial sources. Therefore, the Bank's financiai
contribution would help to finance profitable ana much needed exoansion of the
power system and would also act as a cataLyst *n attracting the required
co-financing for the proposed project.
Project Objectives: The proposed project is designed to (a) re.tore
and strengthen SONELGAZ's financial position with a gradual shift to greater
financial and managerial autonomy; (b) continue the implementation of some
major investments that would contr .te to the improvement of Algeria's power
system; and (c) assist SONELGAZ in -cs efforts to improve its management,
planning and engineering capabilities. The proposed project would also
provide a vehicle for dialogue with SONELGAZ and the Government on
rationalizing SONELGAZ's overall procurement procedures.
6.         Pro-ect Description:  Ihe proposed project would strengthen the
existing power system through (a) the construction of about 475 km of 220-kV
transmission lines to interconnect the power station under construction at
Jijel to SONEI.GAZ's bulk supply system; (b) the construction and/or extension
of seven 220-kV transformer substations with total installed capacity of about
2180 MVA; (c) the supply of specialized equipment and vehicles to assist
SONELGAZ in improving its operational e.ficiency; (d) supporting various
studies for power system loss reduction, manpower development and financial
management systems, and to define optimal power generation option including
the combined-cycle alternative in SONELGAZ's power generation system; and (e)
supporting a substantial training program for SONELGAZ staff through the
provision of improved technical and 'raining materials. The project, to be
carried out over 6 years, provides funds for civil works, equipment,
installation and erection, training arid technical assistance. The total cost
of the project including interest during construction is estimated at about
US$424.0 million equivalent wiLh a foreign exchange component of about US$
285.0 million equivalent (67%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the
disbursement schedule are shown in schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group Operations in Algeria are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7054-AL dated June 9, 1988 is also attached.
7.         ARreed Actions:  The Government and SONELGAZ have agreed on a
comprehensive set of actions aiming at restoring SONELGAZ's financial
viability and improving its operational efficiency. The actions specifically
include the following: (a) achievement by SONELGAZ of a net internal cash
generation of at least 3% in 1990, 7Z in 1991, 13Z in 1992 and 152 in 1993
and thereafter; (b) settlement by December 31, 1990 of all arrears due to
SONELGAZ as of Decemrner 31, 1987 by the public sector including Central
Administrations, Local Governments and public enterprises; (c) establishment
of payment procedures whereby future receivables should not exceed, at year
end, two months of total sales during the year; (d) provision for SONELGAZ to
1,ave its accourts audited by qualified external auditors acceptable to the
Bank; (e) completion and implementation of the recommendations of a Management
and Accounting Systems study; (f) settlement by December 31, 1989 of all
arrears due to SONELGAZ by its former operational units; (g) undertaking by



- 3 -
SONELGAZ of three studies of a loss-reduction program, a manpower development
system and the revision of its investment program to take account of the
combined-cycle option. SONELGAZ has also agreed to (h) exchange views with
the Bank on its investment program; (i) submit to the Bank not later than
December 31, 1988 a detailed staff training program; and (j) complete the
acquisition of the required land for the substations included in the project
by December 31, 1988.
8.         Justification:  The primary justification for the project lies in
the support it brings to the financial restructuring of SONELGAZ. Under the
restructuring SONELGAZ will, move from a position of negative net internal cash
generation to a positive level in 1990 with progressively higher intern-al
contributions thereafter. To meet this objective, the Government agreed to
allow annual increases in electricity tariffs, which have hitherto been held
constant since 1962 for low-voltage customers and since 1982 for medium and
high-voltage customers. However, this reversal of tariff policy has to be
implementtcd carefully and gradually, partly because of uncertainties
surrounding the effects of the economic reforms now under way (in particular,
the pace at which the existing extensive price controls in the rest of the
economy will be lifted and the anticipated movements in overall wage and price
levels). Consequently, the Government has proposed and the Bank h-s agreed
that, in the context of the particular project, the most immediate priority is
to raise prices so as to meet the initial financial objectives for SONELGAZ.
These increases will still leave electricity prices considerably below the
long-run marginal cost of supply. The Government recognizes that for
financial and economic efficiency reasons it may be necessary to raise
electricity prices further.
9.         The project is also justified as being an integral part of
SONELGAZ's system development program as reviewed and appro-ed by the Bank.
Calculation of an economic rate of return for this investment program as a
whole is critically dependant upon the estimate used for the value that
electricity consumers attach to incremental electricity supply, i.e., their
"twillingness to pay." For the reasons set out above, electricity tariff rates
in Algeria are not a very good representation of this "willingness to pay"
and, indeed, their use as a proxy for economic benefits results in a
relatively low economic rate of return of 6.32. However, inclusion of the
full consumers' surplus in .he economic benefit calculations would yield a
considerably higher rate of return (around 20%).
10.        Risk:  No special technical risks are foreseen.  The main risk
during project implementation is that the financial restructuring program for
SONELGAZ may not be implemented as envisaged; this risk is addressed through
the financial and other covenants which form part of the legal agreements.
11.        Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve .? -roposed loan.
