DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
THIRD POWER PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Societ6 Nationale de l'ElectriciL6 et du Gaz
(SONELGAZ)
Guarantor:             Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria
Loan Amount:           US$ 160 million equivalent
Terms:                  Fifteen years, including five years of grace, at
the standard variable interest rate. SONELGAZ
would assume the foreign exchange and the variable
interest rate risks.
Project Description   The project supports a financial restructuring
designed to ensure a satisfactory financial
autonomy and performance of SONELGAZ. It would
strengthen the eListing power system by (a' the
construction of about 475 km of 220-kV transmission
lines to interconnect the power station under
construction at Jijel to SONELGAZ's bulk supply
systems; (b) the ccrstruction and/or extension of
seven 220-kV transformer substations with total
installed capacity of about 2180 MVA; and (c) the
supply of specialized equipment and vehicles to
assist SONELGAZ in improving its operational
efficiency. The project would support studies for:
power system loss reduction; manpower cevelopment;
financial management systems; and the definition of
optimal power generation options including the
combined-cycle alternative in SONELGAZ's power
generation system. It would also support a
substantial training program for SONELGAZ staff
through the provision of improved technical and
training materials.
Benefits and Risks:   In addition to improved institutional performaalce,
benetits are also expected from expanded
electricity sales and reduced losses.  No special
technical risks are foreseen. The main risk during
project implementation is that the financial
restructuring program for SONELGAZ may not be
implemented as envisaged; this risk is addressed
through the financial and other covenants which
form part of the legal agreements.

THIRD POWER PROJECT
1. THE ENERGY SECTOR
1.01     This chapter presents a brief overview of the energy sector, the
Government's energy strategy, and the objectives of the Bank's assistance to
Algeria.
The Resource Base
1.02     Algeria's substantial energy resources are dominated by gas, gas
liquids and crude oil. There are also minor coal deposits and limited
potential for the generation of hydroelectricity.
1.03     Proven natural gas resources in Algeria amount to about 3,200
billion cubic meters or 2.9 billion tons of oil equivalent (toe). They are
the fifth largest in the world and account for nearly 42 of proven world
reserves. In addition, probable and possible reserves amount to about 580
and 470 billion cubic meters, respectively. The bulk of the reserv.s are in
the form of non-associated, wet gas, i.e. in reservoirs not associated with
crude oil, but rich in gas liquids such as condensates and liquid petroleum
gases (LPGs). Non-associated gas output rose to 86% of total gas outout in
1985; 77% of total gas output was from Algeria's largest gas field, at Hassi
R'Mel.   Total national reserves of condensates are estimated at 0.45
billion tons and there is a very large potential for additional
gas-condensate discoveries.
1.04     At the end of 1985  Algeria's remaining ultimately recoverable
reserves of crude oil were estimated at about 1.49 billion tons (95%
probability) and 3.66 billion tons (5% probability). Nearly 70% of total
output in 1985 was from the five largest fields. Four of these were
discovered before 1962 and are now substantially depleted. Recent
discoveries of crude oil have been small and have not added significantly to
proven reserves. Crude oil production has been allowed to decline during
the 1980s because of the declining discovery rate and the adoption by the
Government of a conservative oil production rate policy.
1.05     Algeria's coal reserves - about 40 million tons (30 million toe) -
are mainly in the Abadla basin in the southwest. About half of this coal is
of coking quality; the remainder is suitable for steam production, e.g.
electricity generation. Currently there is no domestic production of coal.
Algeria imported 812 thousand tons of coking coal in 1985.



-2-
1.06     Most of Algeria's limited hydro potential is already being
exploited. Average annual generation from controlled storage is about
320 GWh.  This is supplemented by an ave:age of 70 GWh/y from small
run-of-river Llants and 50 GWh/y from plants associated with irrigation
schemes. Installed capacity is 285 MW, of which 194 MW could be considered
firm power, and there are plans to install another 5 MW by the early 1990s.
While there is some potential for new capacity as part of future irrigation
schemes, in general the pumping requirements of such schemes make them heavy
net consumers of electrical energy.
1.07     Uranium reserves in the extreme south of the country are estimated
at 25,000 tons of uranium metal. Preliminary geophysical and
hydrogeochemical studies indicate the presence of substantial geothermal
resources in northern Algeria. Solar radiation is particularly intense in
the south and there are many locations with wind energy at speeds of more
than 3 meters/second.
Institutions in the Enerpy Sector
1.08     Production, processing and distribution of energy are the
responsibility of a number of state-owned enterprises, most of which fall
under the supervision of the Ministry of Energy and Chemical and
Petrochemical Industries (MEICP). Exploration and development of uranium
and coal are now the responsibility of enterprises which report to the
Ministry of Heavy Industry. Decisions on energy investments and energy
prices also require approvals, principally from the National Commission of
Planning and the Ministries of Finance, and Commerce. A series of far
reaching institutional reforms is in progress in the energy sector. The
process began with organizational reforms in the early 1980s and is now
entering a phase of financial restructuring. The objective is to set up
units with greater autonomy and more directly responsible for the various
activities covered by the sector.
1.09     Until the early 1980s, virtually all oil, gas and electricity-
related activities were centralized in two public enterprises - SONATRACH
(Societe nationale pour la recherche, la production, le transport, la
transformation et la commercialisation des hydrocarbures) and SONELGAZ
(Soci6t6 nationale de l'electricit6 et du gaz). In 1981, SONATRACH was
reorganized with a focus on upstream oil and gas activities and exports. A
new enterprise, NAFTAL, was created to manage oil refining and domestic
distribution of petroleum products, including LPGs. Petroleum service
activities - geophysical work, drilling, petroleum engineering,
pipelineconstruction, etc. - were handed over to eight smaller
special-purpose companies.
1.10     SONATRACH holds a monopoly on the exploration, production and
export of oil and gas. Foreign participation in exploration and production
has declined to very low levels since independence; however, new legislation
was passed in 1986 to make conditions more attractive and has already led to
the signing of three new exploration contracts. On the domestic market,
SONATRACH sells crude oil to NAFTAL, and natural gas to ex-affiliates of the
SONATRACH group (e.g. in the petrochemical sector) and to SONELGAZ.
SONELGAZ is the sole distributor of natural gas to all other non-export
customers. It also has a national monopoly on electricity sales.



1.11     The reorganization of SONATRACH was followed in 1984 by the
reorganization of SONE'GAZ. A number of units with responsibility for
activities such as civil works, construction of electricity and gas
distribution systems, and manufacturing of poles and meters were divested to
form six small independent enterprises.  Other enterprises, including some
that are owned by the wilayas (regional administrations), now participate in
construction programs such as the rural electrification components of the
National Electrification Program (PNE). The Government recently approved
the financial restructuring of SONELGAZ (para 4.11-4.13), which is the first
of the large public enterprises to enter the second stage of reform. To
some extent, this exercise will be a prototype for the other public
enterprises in the energy sector and country-wide.
1.12     Within defined limits, industries are permitted to generate
electricity - or to cogenerate heat and electricity - for their own
consumption, providing this is the least-cost option.   Autogeneration
accounted for 8.5% of total national generation of electricity in 1985.
Responsibility for approval of autogeneration has recently been transferred
from SONELGAZ to APRUE (l'Agence pour la promotion, rationalisation et
utilisation de l'energie), a newly created energy management agency under
the supervision of MEICP.
Energy Demand and Supply
1.13     Key indicators of the Algerian energy sector and their evolution
since 1965 are summarized below (Table 1.1).  A full national energy balance
for 1985 is given in Annex 1.1.

1.14     Energy demand by final domestic consumers has consistently
increased by 10-12% p.a., far outstripping the growth of primary energy
production. Final consumption absorbed 15% of primary production in 1985.
The structure of final energy consumption reflects Algeria's very rapid
industrialization since inc'pendence, with industry and construction's share
coughly doubling in 20 y .Ls. This has been accompanied by increasing
penetration of natural Fas and LPGs at the expense of other fuels - up from
16% of final consumption in 1965 to 27% in 1985. Natural gas also fuels
about 90% of total electricity generation, thereby indirectly supplying a
further 21% of final demand. At the end of 1985, energy consumption per
capita was about 1.0 toe. Energy exports, while remaining the driving force
of the Algerian economy, have fallen from 90% of primary energy production
to 78% over the last decade.
Forecast Energy Demand and Supply
1.15     Total final eneigy demand is forecast to grow by 8.8% per year
between 1985 and 1990 and by 6.9% per year between 1990 and 2000 (Table 1.2)
which is significantly less than the annual average of 10.4% experienced
between 1975 and 1985. This decline is due to the slowdown in economic
growth attributable mainly to the decline in international oil prices in
1986. The share of petroleum products is projected to fall from 45% in 1985
to 33% in the year 2000 while the shares of gas and LPGs, electricity
(mostly produced by natural gas), solid fuels (nearly all coal), and solar
are all projected to increase to make up the difference.

1.16     Energy exports are forecast to increase until 1990, but by the year
2000 they may be below the 1985 level (Table 1.3) mainly because of a
substantial decline in oil exports due to rising domestic demand and declining
oil production as reserves are depleted (unless s.gnificant i;ew discoveries
are made). By the year 2000 energy exports are projected to fall to about 56%
of primary energy production.

Energy Strategy
1.17     Algeria's natural gas resources are very large in relation to
potential domestic consumption. This is less true of crude oil, where the
ratio of remaining recoverable reserves to annual production has generally
been in the range of 30 to 40 years during the last decade. For this
reason, Algeria has progressively shifted the emphasis from oil to gas, both
in the export sector and as the main fuel for the domestic economy. In the
mid 1970s, gas utilization was concentrated on exports of liquefied natural
gas (LNG) and on domestic consumption for electricity generation and for
industry. Since that time, the commissioning of the Transmediterranean
pipeline (through Tunisia to Italy) has opened up a second means of
exporting natural gas. Flaring has been greatly reduced and a large
proportion of gas production is now reinjected to optimize output of crude
oil and condensates; LPGs are now extracted from all possible sources - raw
gas, condensates, natural gas liquids and refinery process streams. During
the 1980s, this strategy has enabled Algeria to keep oil production within
its OPEC quota, which applies to crude oil but not to condensates, while
significantly diversifying its energy exports.
1.18     In recent years an increasingly competitive market for natural gas
has developed in North America and in Western Europe. On both continents
there are now multiple suppliers with large reserves serving a nearly fully
integrated gas distribution network. Under these market conditions,
Algeria's reluctance to follow downward movements in international gas
prices has led to a loss of markets and significant under-utilization of its
LNG export capacity. In 1987, Algeria finally responded by arranging spot
cargoes of LNG to former customers at times when market conditions
facilitated agreements on price for spot sales. The main challenge facing
Algeria's energy planners in the export sector is to develop a strategy for
winning a larger share of the North American and Western European gas

1.19     In the domestic energy sector, natural gas is the dominant source
of primary energy for all economic sectors other than transport - either
directly, or indirectly via electricity generation. A May 1985 policy
statement listed the following objectives of Government domestic energy
policy:
-    to ensure that electricity, natural gas and petroleum products are
reliably available wherever they are needed;
-    to replace domestic consumption of petroleum products with natural
gas or LPGs wherever possible, in order to maximize the exportable
surplus of petroleum (crude and products);
-    to encourage direct use of natural gas by limiting electricity
consumption to non-substitutable uses and off-peak thermal
applications that improve the economics of electricity generation;
and
-    to conserve national oil and gas resources by promoting efficient
use of energy.
1.20     The main instrument for achieving these goals has been increased
public investment in energy supply. During the early 1980s, the most
visible target was to connect 100% of "electrifiable households" by the end
of the decade. In addition, there has been an increase in investment in
infrastructure for transmission and distribution of natural gas, and to a
lesser extent for distribution of LPGs for households and vehicles. On the
demand side, the Government's stated strategy until 1985 was to promote the
desired pattern of energy consumption by gradual adjustment of relative
energy prices and by direct regulatorr intervention. After the collapse in
oil prices in early 1986, mobilization of investment resources became an
additional concern in the domestic energ'y supply subsectors.
Enerag Pricir.
1.21     In the past, prices in the Algerian economy were mostly used as
accounting indicators rather than signals for economic efficiency. As a
result, there is currently no explicit linkage, in the energy sector,
between domestic and international oil and LPG prices. Until 1986, the
domestic prices of many petroleum products were below their export value on
the world market. The combination of the international oil price collapse
in 1986 and recent increases in domestic prices has eliminated this gap for
all products other than kerosene (Table 1.4). If an allowance is made for
the cost of distributing petroleum products from the refinery to the
consumer, gas oil and LPGs may also be subsidized in some inland locations.
In the transport market, relative prices reflect the Government's policy of
promoting LPGs as an alternative to gasoline. The possibility of uneconomic
substitution from gasoline to gas oil is limited by strict controls on
imports of diesel vehicles.

1.22     While Algeria's limited oil reserves provide a justification for
fixing petroleum product prices close to the international level, the much
larger reserves of natural gas (relative to current and prospective demand)
and the expectation that exports could not be greatly increased without
large price adjustments in international markets provide a justification for
setting prices for domestic gas sales below the export price. However, each
price should cover the corresponding long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of
production, transmission and distribution of proven recoverable reserves
plus a "depletion premium" which reflects the opportunity cost of using the
resource today rather than saving it for the future. The depletion premium
is measured by the present value in a given year of a unit of gas sold at
the time of last production from the reserves less the LRMC. Adoption of
this pricing policy would help to ensure an optimal use of depletable
reserves of natural gas over time.
1.23     Publicly available data do not permit precise estimation of the
LRMC. The Government has indicated that gas development, production and
transmission costs wculd amount to about $1.00 per million Btus, based on
past expenditures. This figure may be used as an approximation of the LRMC
assuming constant costs of supply. Estimation of the depletion premium is
subject to much uncertainty since it depends on uncertain forecasts of the
growth of demand over several decades and of the value of substitute forms
of energy at the end of the useful life of the gas reserves. Examination of



- 8 -
a number of plausible scenarios suggests that the depletion premium would be
negligible at the present time, but would rise rapidly over time if demand
grows quickly and new reserves are not found. These considerations of the
LRMC and the depletion premium suggest that the economic cost of natural gas
(before distribution) is currently about $1.00 per million Btus (cAD
1.87/thermie). This value is below the export price but above domestic
prices at the bulk supply and high pressure levels as shown in Table 1.5
below.

As indicated in para. 1.21, the domestic prices do not give the right
signals to the consumer. The Government is aware of this problem and is
currently changing its policy to move toward the general application of
prices which reflect economic costs.
Bank Stratery
1.24     Since the early 1980s, the Government has been cautiously
implementing a series of economic reforms. Key Government objectives
include relaxation of central planning, development of a more autonomous
financial system, promotion of the private sector, and improved mobilization
and allocation of resources via pricing reforms.  In the longer term, the
reforms are expected to tackle the problems of export diversification and
the efficiency of the import-substitution industries.  The Bank's present
program is designed to support the implementation of the Government's reform
programs in key sectors and public enterprises, and to assist in the
preparation of later stages of the reform.
1.25     In the energy sector and until recently, the Bank's participation
has been confined to the power subsector, where there have been two loans
since independence (para. 2.19). Preparations for a third loan were
suspended in 1982 when the Government failed to take action to address
SONELGAZ's deteriorating financial situation, and there was then a lull in
contacts until early 1985, wlien preparation of the proposed project began,
followed in June 1986 by a Bank review of the 1985-89 National Plan. The



1985-1989 Plan Review 1/ included a preliminary survey of thc hydrocarbons
subsector as well as suggestions for future Bank participation in the energy
sector in general. This dialogue needs to be pursued and consolidated
before Bank lending can address sectorwide issues. Therefore, in the energy
sector, Bank support is focusing currently on the domestic power and gas
utility (SONELGAZ) and, in particular: successful implementation of the
approved financial restructuring program (paras. 4.11-4.13); optimization of
electricity use at power stations and in the transmission and distribution
networks (para. 2.15); optimization of investment programs (para. 5.04); and
strengthening of SONELGAZ's management and accounting systems (para. 4.30).
At a subsequent stage attention would be extended to additional objectives
including: moving domestic natural gas prices towards economic cost (paras.
1.23 and 1.24); moving electricity prices towards economic cost (para. 2.08)
ensuring that the structure of electricity tariffs reflects economic costs
as closely as possible, (para. 2.08); and making further progress in
defining a new framework for the relationship between Government and
SONELGAZ (para. 4.11).

II. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
Subsector Organization and the Beneficiarv
2.01     The development and operation of Algeria's power subsector is the
responsibility of MEICP and SONELGAZ. As stated in para. 1.09, MEICP is
responsible for coordinating the economic and social aspects of the power
subsector activities. SONELGAZ, a government-owned enterprise, is the
beneficiary of the proposed loan, and was created under Presidential decree
No. 69-59 of July 28, 1969 when all the obligations and assets of
Electricite et Gaz d'Algerie (EGA) were transferred to it. SONELGAZ is
responsible for the development and operation of the power system. It has
the exclusive right to transmit ar.d distribute electric power throughout the
country. Its right to generate power is not exclusive. Factories requiring
more than 1,000 kilovolt-amperes (kVA) may be auto-producers, and any
factory requiring process heat may generate its own electricity for maximum
economy. However, any excess production of electricity must be sold by the
auto-producers to SONELGAZ. The company is also the sole distributor of
natural gas, which is purchased in bulk from SONATRACH.
2.02     SONELGAZ is managed by a board of directors headed by the General
Manager who is appointed by the President and is accountable to MEICP. The
board currently includes three deputy general directors, five other
directors with functional responsibility respectively for: (i) planning;
(ii) finance; (iii) engineering, generation and transmission; (iv)
distribution; and (v) administrative services; and two representatives of
SONELGAZ's workers' association. Operational responsibility is assigned to
four regions for the transmission network and nine zones for the
distribution system. Also reporting to the board are six main Committees
responsible respectively for human resources, research, investments,
consumers co.nections, education and training, and hot line works.   The
current organization is satisfactory and SONELGAZ's management is strong,
knowledgeable and competent.
Manpower Development and Training
2.03     The labor force employed by SONELGAZ has grown mainly in the
technical area to meet the needs of the rapidly expanding power subsector.
The total labor force has grown from about 7000 employees in 1975 to about
18,800 in 1986.  Labor productivity has also grown from about 330 MWh per
employee in 1975 to about 600 MWh in 1986. This is a relatively high
productivity rate compared to those of other countries in the region, and
SONELGAZ's operation and maintenance performance remains satisfactory.
However, recognizing the need for a continuous improvement in its staff
performance and in order to achieve this objective, SONELGAZ is planning to
undertake, with Bank assistance, a manpower development study.  The
objective of the study is to define the requirements for improving staff
performance and motivation, the sharing of responsibilities at all levels,
planning, budgeting and control of works to be executed, operational and
maintenance services.  Draft terms of reference for this study are attached
in Annex 2.1.



- 11 -
2.04     Furthermore, to strengthen manpower development at SONELGAZ the
proposed project would also include a training component which aims at
improving SONELGAZ's capabilities in financial planning and network
engineering, design, operation and maintenance. This training would be
provided to specialized and experienced personnel in certain specific
areas. The proposed project would provide training for about 440 trainees
for the whole period of project implementation. During negotiations
SONELGAZ agreed to submit to the Bank not later than December 31, 1988 a
detailed staff training program and its implementation schedule (para. 6.04).
Electicity Tariffs
2.05     Electricity pricing has been subject to the same set of issues that
lhave affected pricing policy in the economy as a whole. Nevertheless, in
1980, a new tariff structure was proposed based on a comprehensive study of
the projected long-run marginal costs of generation, transmission and
distribution and the financial implications of alternative rate structures.
The proposed tariff structure, which is an unusually pure application of the
principles of marginal cost pricing, was implemented through 1982 and
finally adopted only for SONELGAZ's electricity sales at high and
medium-voltage levels, which account for approximately two-thirds of total
electricity sales. At these voltage levels, consumers are allowed to choose
between different combinations of demand and energy charges, including
time-of-day rates. The introduction of the propozed marginal cost tariff
for low-voltage consumers resulted in average rate increases in the order of
33X but the tariff was withdrawn shortly after its introduction. The
previous tariff structure system remains in force for low voltage
consumers. There have been no rate increases since 1980 and the real value
of the tariff has been eroded by inflation since then. This is the main
cause of SONELGAZ's deteriorating financial performance over the same period
(para. 4.04). The present tariff structure is summarized in Annex 2.2.
2.06     Comparison With Economic Costs.   Table 2.1 compares the current
tariff rates to economic costs, the latter measured by long-run marginal
costs (Annex 2.3). Marginal energy costs were calculated using the economic
cost of natural gas (para 1.23). Generation capacity costs are based on
border prices for equipment converted at the October 1987 exchange rate of
US$1.00 = AD4.96; transmission and distribution capacity costs are based on
the average incremental costs of SONELGAZ's current investment program. The
costs at medium and low-voltage levels are unusually high and are
exacerbated by high distribution losses. The very high costs partly reflect
the high capital cost of completing the last part of the National
Electrification Program. This comparison indicates that electricity tariff
rates are now approximately two-thirds of economic costs.

Source: Bank estimates
2.07     An updating of energy tariffs (electricity and gas) in line with
changes in economic and financial costs is urgently required. The immediate
benefits of this updating would be: (a) to restrain the growth of domestic
energy demand and the need to divert scarce investment resources to meet that
demand; (b) to mobilize additional investment resources directly from
consumers; and (c) to ensure more efficient use of Algeria's principal energy
resource - natural gas.
2.08     For these reasons, the Bank supports the Government's strategy for
the financial restructuring of SONELGAZ, designed to allow the power public
utility to reach a greater autonomy by the turn of the decade. However, the
combination of financial actions should be adjusted towards larger tariff
increases in order to reduce the gap between electricity prices and economic
cost. As a second priority - and in support of the same objective - some form
of marginal cost-based tariff should be introduced for low voltage
consumption. In line with the Government's social objectives, low income
consumers may be protected by a "lifeline block" at the existing tariff
level. Finally, before the end of the decade, the current marginal cost
estimates should be reviewed and updated, and the changes reflected in the
levels and structure of the electricity tariff. Two revisions should be
incorporated: (a) the use of a shadow exchange rate for the border-price
evaluation of investment costs, and (b) fuel costs based on the economic cost
of natural gas. Since capital costs account for more than three-quarters of
economic supply costs, the revised marginal costs will be particularly
sensitive to the first of these parameters (Annex 2.3).
2.09      Demand Management.  Since the introduction of the new tariff,
SONELGAZ has worked closely with major consumers to assist them to plan demand



- 13 -
management programs that will take maximum advantage of the cost-cutting
possibilities offered by the new tariff. Many of the tariffs offered provide
very strong incentives to electricity consumers to shift their consumption
from peak to off-peak periods (examples in Table 2.2). Despite the erosion of
the real value of the tariffs by inflation, this structure continues to
provide a satisfactory framework for major consumers to design programs of
energy demand management. In general, the results have been disappointing.
For example, the proportion of energy consumed during the peak has not fallen
noticeably. In many instances the measures proposed by SONELGAZ have not been
adopted because the industry's management is absorbed by more pressing
problems, such as recovering from low levels of capacity utilization.
However, the poor response to the demand ma.agement incentives embodied in the
electricity tariff appears to be part of a wider problem, that is, the lack of
incentives to managers to cut costs as a way of improving industrial
performance. This lack of incentives results from the limited financial
autonomy of public enterprises. Progress towards more efficient use of
investment resources in the energy producing and consuming industries in
Algeria will now depend on the implementation of the reform of the public
enterprise system which will provide managers with incentives to reduce costs,
and on the efforts of the newly created energy management agency (,PRUE) to
address these difficult institutional issues.

Electricity Consumption
2.10     During the period 1976-1986, total consumption of electricity
increased at an average rate of 12% p.a, with sales at each voltage level
growing at approximately the same rate. Annex 2.4 gives the breakdown of
electricity sales by voltage level for the period 1976-1986.
2.11     Present Consumption Patterns.    Public electricity consumption is
concentrated in the northern interconnected system (87% of total SONELGAZ
electricity sales of 10,223 GWh in 1986), and is evenly distributed among
the three major voltage levels (Annex 2.4). As a result of Algeria's
emphasis on development of heavy industry, the proportion of consumption at
high voltage is unusually high in relation to other countries at similar
income levels. More than 80% of high-voltage consumption occurs in three
economic sectors - petroleum operations, steel and related industries, and
construction materials (mainly cement and bricks). In 1984, the six largest
customers accounted for 45% of total high-voltage consumption. Medium-
voltage consumption is more evenly spread over a wide range of light



- 14 -
industries and services. The typical low-voltage consumer is a household
(using electricity for lights, a refrigerator and a television) cr a
government office, the government accounting for about 14% of total
low-voltage (LV) consumption.  The number of consumers in the "ordinary LV"
category is growing at about 200,000 per year as a result of a vigorous
national electrification program (PNE: Programme national d'electrification)
and a program of new connections in existing distribution areas (RCN:
raccordement de la clientele nouvelle). At the end of 1986, the total
number of LV consumers was 2.4 million and the rate of electrification of
the population was 73%.
2.12     Load Forecasts.  Load forecasts were prepared by the appraisal
mission in consultation with SONELGAZ (para. 5.02 and Annex 2.5). They were
prepared using SONELGAZ methodology except for medium-voltage consumption,
where the estimates are linked to projections of sectoral value added. On
the basis of these forecasts, total electricity sales will grow at around
8.7% annually and sales at the three voltage levels will retain roughly
equal shares through the period. SONELGAZ methodology (which the Bank found
satisfactory) was used to convert the sales forecast to generation and
maximum demand forecasts for the interconnected system (Annexes 2.5 and
2.7).   Key parameters are transmission and distribution loss rates,the
system load factor, and the timing of the planned interconnection between
the main system and the last of the larger isolated networks (1988/89).
Under these assumptions generation on the interconnected system will grow at
an average annual rate of approximately 9.2% through the decade to 1996.
Starting from 1919 MW in 1986, maximum demand will grow by 9.9% per year to
reach 4942 MW ten years later.
The Supply System
2.13     SONELGAZ's electricity generation system is dominated by gas-fired
plants - steam turbines on the coast and combustion turbines at inland sites
(Annex 2.6). In 1986 total installed capacity was 3,385 MW and total
generation amounted to 11,980 Gwh. Steam turbines accounted for 51% of
total installed capacity and 55% of generation, while combustion turbines
accounted for 38% of installed capacity and 41% of generation. Hydro energy
makes a small contribution to the main interconnected system and diesel
plant is used for small loads in isolated locations. A significant
proportion of total national generation (7.6% in 1986) is directly generated
and consumed by industry. The bulk of the primary energy for industrial
autogeneration is supplied by natural gas.
2.14     The SONELGAZ electricity transmission system consists of (a) a
220-kV interconnected network, with three active links with Tunisia (at
90 kV and 150 kV) and an inactive 220-kV link with Morocco, and (b) two
isolated grids in the south centered on the two main oil and gas producing
areas - Hassi Messaoud and Hassi R'Mel. Electricity trade with Tunisia
appears to have been ccnfined to mutual support during capacity shortfalls.
In 1984 net electricity imports reached their highest ever level, amounting
to 7% of energy delivered to SONELGAZ networks. At the end of 1986, the
transmission network comprised: (a) 4076 km of 220-kV, 46 km of 150-kV,
415 km of 90-kV and 4521 km of 60-kV lines; and (b) 3900 MVA and 8390 MVA of
transformer capacity at power stations and in the network, respectively.
The distribution network at the end of 1986 consisted of 44,244 km of
medium-voltage lines, 40,181 km of low voltage lines, and 29,388 medium to
low-voltage transformers.



- 15 -
2.15     Total power system losses, excluding auxiliary consumption of
generating stations, were 14.62 of net generation in 1986. Losses in the
distribution system are about 13.82 of the total energy delivered to the
distribution system, which is higher than economically achievable levels of
about 8S; transmission losses are about 51 of the net sent out energy 1/,
compared with achievable levels of about 31. In order to assist SONELGAZ to
reduce the level of losses in a more comprehenslve manner, the proposed
Project would include a Power Loss Reduction Stidy to determine measures to
reduce the level of losses and the corresponding investment program. Draft
terms of reference (TORs) "or this study (Anne2 2.8) have been discussed
with SONELGAZ.  During negotiations, SONELGAZ i.greed to appoint by June 30,
1989 consultants to undertake the above-mentioned study, to review with the
Bank before June 30, 1991 the recommended action plan to reduce the level of
losses and to implement the agreed recommendations (para. 6.04).
The Investment Program
2.16     The Bank has reviewed the methods used by SONELGAZ to plan the size
and timing of new capacity - details in paras. 5.03-5.08 (the Least-Cost
Investment Program). The methods used for generation and transmission are
satisfactory; regional master plans are now being developed for distribution
systems. With the assistance of SONELGAZ, the Bank revised SONELGAZ's
current investment program downwards to conform to the demand forecast shown
in Annex 2.5. The main changes consisted of delaying new generating units
which are planned but not yet under construction (Annex 2.7). Annex 2.9
gives estimated investment expenditures by SONELGAZ 1987 and projected
expenditures for the period 1988-1995.
2.17     The early years of the investment program are dominated by the
commissioning in 1988 of 1000 MW of combustion turbines in four locations.
This is followed by 936 MW of steam turbines at Marsat and Jijel in 1991 and
1992. In 1994 the first of the new 300 MW series of steam turbines will be
commissioned at Skikda, and this will be followed by a second 300 MW unit at
Skikda and by similar units at Alger Ouest and Marsat El Hadjadj before the
end of the 1990s.
2.18     The cost of SONELGAZ's total investment program (including gas
investments) over the period 1987-95 is AD 72,900 million (current dinars),
of which AD 22,579 million (311) is for electricity generation, AD 12,619
million (171) for electricity transmission, and AD 18,022 million (251) for
electricity distribution. The investmenlt program is likely to change over
time as a result of changes in demand forecasts and other factors. During
negotiations SONELGAZ agreed to excharge views with the Bank on its
investment program as part of its annual review of load forecasts and
investment program (para. 6.04).
Bank Involvement in the Sector
2.19     In 1955, prior to Algeria's independence, a loan of US$10 million
(131-FR) was made to Electricite et Gaz d'Algerie (EGA) to help finance part
of its 1955-1958 development program. Two more loans to SONELGAZ, the
1/ In 1986 transmission losses were unusually high at 6.51 because of
abnormal long distance transfer of energy due to forced outages in the
network (para. 5.07).

successor of EGA, iollowed. A loan of of US$38.5 million (997-AL) was made
in 1974 for a combustion turbine station, several substations, a load
dispatch system, and consulting services'to improve SON'ELGAZ's
organization. A second loan (Loan 1293-AL) was made to SONELGAZ in 1976 in
the amount of US$57.5 million to help fina;ce SONELGAZ's 1976-1980
develop,nent program. Both Drojects formed gart'of SONELGAZ's investment
program for 1973-1980, and a combined Project Completion Report was issued
in June 1982. From a technical point of view the Projects were a success.
The institution-building objectives were also substantiall- achieved.
However, the Project's objectives were not achieved in the area of
SONELGAZ's financial goals, where fundamental differences remained between
the viewpoints of the Government and the Bank regarding SONELGAZ's
deteriorating financial situation. These differences diminished
considerably during the economic reforms of the mid 1980s, leading to a
consensus on SONELGAZ's financial restructuring as the focus of the proposed
Project which would, in addition, assist SONELGAZ in implementing its
1988-1995 investment program.

III. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
3.01     The recent decline in hydrocarbon revenues in the Algerian economy
underlines the need to offset these falling revenues by increasing
efficiency in the energy sector. The main objectives of the proposed
project are to: (i) restore and strengthen SONELGAZ's financial position
with a gradual shift to greater autonomy and by ensuring continued attention
to measures necessary to achieve this objective; (ii) continue the
implementation of some major investments that would contribute to the
improvement of Algeria's power system by optimizing the productivity of
ongoing investments in power generation; and (iii) improve the quality of
power supply. The project's further objectives are to: (i) continue to
develop the exchange of energy between Aigg-)a and its neighboring country
Tunisia; and (ii) assist SONELC-AZ in its. institution building efforts for
improving its management, planning and engii-.ering capabilities.
Project Description
3.02     The proposed project is part of SONELGAZ's least-cost development
program for the period 1988-1995, and would involve:
(a) the construction of about 475 km of 220-kV transmission lines to
interconnect the power station under construction at Jijel to
SONELGAZ's bulk supply system;
(b) the construction and/or exteasion of six 220/60-kV and one
220/90/30-kV transformer substations with total installed capacity
of about 2180 MVA;
(c) the supply of specialized equipment and vehicles;
(d) training and supply of devices such as computer software and
hardware to strengthen SONELGAZ's capabilities in network
engineering, planning and financial management; and
(e) consulting services to assist SONELGAZ in carrying out various
studies for power system loss reduction, manpower development and
financial management systems, and a study to determine the
opportunity for introducing the combined-cycle alternative in
SONELGAZ's future power generation system.
Annex 3.1 gives a detailed description of the proposed project and IBRD Map
No. 19926R indicates the location of the main project components
(transmission lines and substations).
Project Cost
3.03     The estimated cost of the proposed project including physical and
price contingencies is about AD 2,543.0 million (US$391.2 million). The
total financing required, inclusive of interest during construction (US$
32.8 million), is about AD 2,768.0 million (US$424.0 million) of which
AD 1,865.0 million (US$285.0 million) would be in foreign exchange. The



- 18 -
cost estimates include custom duties and taxes estimated at about AD 280.8
million (US$43.70 million). Details of the cost estimates are given in
Annexes 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 and summarized in Table 3.1 below. These estimates
are based on estimated January 1988 prices derived from quotations received
recently by the Borrower for similar works. Given the advanced stage of
project design, and the repetitive and routine nature of the work for the
substations, physical contingencies are assumed at: (a) lOZ for the lines,
the civil works and installation and erection of the substations, and (b) 5%
for substations equipment and material. Price contingencies have been
computed assuming an implementation period consistent with the relevant Bank
standard profile and specific annual increases for domestic and
international prices as follows:

Project Financing Plan
3.04     The proposed Bank loan of US$160.0 million  would finance about 38%
of the total financing required for the proposed project and about 56% of
the foreign cost. The remaining US$264.0 million would be covered by:
(i) internal credits from the Government through the Banque Algerienne de
Developpement (BAD) for an estimated amount of US$147.5 million; (ii)
other sources of cofinancing being currently explored by the Bank and the
Borrower /a and for an estimated amount of US$ 86.5 million; and
(iii) SONELGAZ's cash generation for an estimated amount of US$30.0
million. A summary of the project financing plan is given in Table 3.2
below.

3.05     The proposed Bank loan would be made to SONELGAZ.  No retroactive
financing is proposed and the foreign exchange risk would be borne by
SONELGAZ.
Status of Engineering
3.06     Expansion of SONELGAZ's transmission network has been planned and
designed by using state of the art computer models and on the basis of:
(a) traditional contingency criteria according to which the system
should ride through disturbances at peak load without incurring
instability cascading or loss of load;
(b) studies carried out to ensure adequate operation and correct design
of the projected system. These studies involve more specifically
load flows, short-circuit study, transient and steady state
stability, switching surges and dynamic overvoltages; and
(c) mechanical and electrical design and specifications of equipment
and materials standardized in accordance with criteria established
during previous construction and operation of SONELGAZ's
transmission system.
The adequacy of these criteria and the results of the studies carried out by
SONELGAZ for its 1988-1995 transmission development program which includes
the proposed Project, have been reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory.
3.07     Engineering of the proposed project will be carried out jointly by
SONELGAZ's own staff and the contractors for the installation of the lines
and substations with the exception of the type of towers to be used for the
transmission line Khemis-Oued Sly, which has been determined with the
assistance of Electricit6 de France (EDF) at the end of 1986. The project
design has been reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory.
Project Implementation
3.08     The proposed project, which will be implemented by SONELGAZ, is in
an advanced stage of preparation and SONELGAZ's Engineering Department has
completed most of the preliminary survey and design work for the
transmission and substation components. The related specifications and
procurement documents are being prepared and bidding documents are expected
to be issued starting June 1988. Conr-act awards for supply of equipment
will start early 1989 and installation and erection works of the facilities
will start in September 1989. The proposed project is expected to be
completed by June 30, 1994. Annex 3.5 gives the detailed project
implementation schedule for the two major components which are the
transmission lines and the substations. SONELGAZ's Engineering Department
will provide overall coordination vis-a-vis the Bank. This department is
well staffed and its performance is satisfactory.
Land Acquisition
3.09     In order to avoid delay in project implementation, SONELGAZ has
already initiated the administrative procedure for the acquisition of the
land requirea for the substations. Out of the seven substations to be
constructed in the proposed project, land is already available for three



- 22 -
substations; for the remaining four substations, sites have been selected
and administrative procedure for purchasing the related land initiated.
During negotiations, SONELGAZ confirmed that the required land for the four
substations would be acquired no later than December 31, 1988 (para. 6.04).
Vehicles and Specialized Equipment
3.10     In 1982, a ministerial decree restricted import of vehicles and
specialized equipment for all public enterprises in Algeria. These
continuous restrictions led to a situation where SONELGAZ's vehicles kept
deteriorating gradually. At the end of 1986, over 80% of SONELGAZ's
vehicles were more than 5 years old and the ratio of their utilization went
up to about 6.5 employees/vehicle which is about twice the acceptable level
of 3 employees/vehicle. The situation was becoming critical and SONELGAZ
management commissioned a study which defined the priority needs of its
operation and maintenance departments to perform their tasks adequately and
more efficientlv.  The acquisition of vehicles and specialized equipment
included in the proposed project will assist SONELGAZ in achieving this
objective and SONELGAZ will be responsible for obtaining the required
exemption to import these vehicles.
Consulting Services
3.11     Implementation of the technical assistance component of the
proposed project will require about:
(a)  50 man-months of consulting services to assist SONELGAZ in the
implementation of the loss reduction study at an estimated total
cost of about US$0.70 million of which about US$0.50 million would
be in foreign exchange;
(b)  130 man-months of consulting services to assist SONELGAZ in the
implementation of the Management Informatiui. Svstem Study
(para. 4.28) at an estimated total cost of about US$2.0 million, of
which US$1.40 million would be in foreign exchange;
(c)  20 man-months of consulting services to assist SONELGAZ in the
Combined-Cycle Study at an estimated total cost of about
US$0.25 million, of wh.'ch US$0.15 million would be in foreign
exchange; and
(d)  30 man-months of consulting services to assist SONELGAZ in the
Manpower Development Study at an estimated total cost of about
US$0.50 million, of which US$0.35 million would be in foreign
exchange.
Procurement
3.12     SONELGAZ has grouped the goods and services to be procured for the
proposed project into 15 packages. Annex 3.6 gives the details of the
packages related to the transmission lines and substations components and
their estimated procurement schedule. The packages proposed for Bank
financing are listed in Table 3.3 below which has been established with the
assumption that joint-financing with Eximbank of Japan would materialize.

All items to be financed by the Bank will be procured in accordance with the
Bank's procurement guidelines. Items (1) through (12) will be procured
through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank
procurement guidelines. For procurement of goods through ICB, local
suppliers will be allowea a margin of preference equal to the existing rate
of custom duty applicable to non-exempt importers or 15% of the
cost-insurance-freight (CIF) price, whichever is lower. Training manuals
and other training aids and computer software/hardware packages will be
procured through international shopping; for such items the Borrower will
obtain written price quotations from at least three qualified suppliers.
About 230 man-months for consulting services will be procured in accordance
with the provision of the Bank's guidelines for Use of Consultants. All
contracts for works, equipment and materials to be financed by the Bank and
costing over US$500,000 each will be subject to prior Bank review. Other
Bank-financed contracts will be subject to post-award review.  To complete
the proposed project SONELGAZ will reserve the procurement for the following
items; which will noL be financed under Lhe prupubed Bank loan for local
suppliers and contractors, (i) the towers for the line Khemis-Oued-Sly; and
(ii) and the conductors, civil works and installation and erection for the
required connections to the main network of the lines and substations
included in the proposed project (about 25 km of lines and seven feeders in
different existing substations). This reserved procurement will not affect
the satisfactory execution of the project and remains compatible with the
Bank's objectives of ensuring economy, efficiency and overall project
soundness. Table 3.4 below summarizes the procurement arrangements for the
proposed project.

Disbursements
3.13     The disbursements from the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan will
be made for:
(a)  65% of the foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment and
materials and 65% of local ex-factory prices of equipment and
materials manufactured in Algeria;
(b)  36% of total cost of contracts for civil works and installation and
erection;
(c)  52% of total expenditures for services of consultants; and
(d)  65% of foreign expenditures for training.
These percentages have been computed on the basis of joint-financing
with Eximbank detailed in Table 3.3.
3.14     The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan is
shown in Annex 3.7 and has been computed on the basis of the EMENA Region
standard profile for similar power project. Annex 3.8 gives a comparisoon
with the actual disbursement of the Algeria First and Second Power Projects
(Loans 997-AL and 1293-AL).
3.15     Disbursement requests will be fully documented except for claims
for expenditures under contracts whose value is less than US$500,000
equivalent. These claims will be subject to presentation of a Statement o.
Expenditures (SOE) for which the supporting documents will be retained by
SONELGPZ and reviewed periodically by the Bank. Also, during negotiations,
SONELGAZ agreed to open and maintain in US Dollars a special account of
US$8.0 million in a major Commercial Bank or in its Central Bank on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.04).
Retroactive- Financing and Advanced Contracting
3.16     No retroactive financing or advanced contracting is involved in the
proposed project.
Environmental Impact
3.17     The proposed project has no major adverse effects on the
environment. Aesthetic impacts on the landscape and, to a lesser extent,
noise are the principal adverse effects. Also SONELGAZ will coordinate the
routing of the lines and the land acquisition with local authorities to
reduce their adverse impact. No environmental hazards are foreseen.
Project Risks
3.18     Two lines, namely El-Mansouriah-Jijel-Bellara and Bellara-Skikda,
are in mountainous areas difficult to reach. However, adequate technology
will be made available to cope with the expected terrain conditions. The
main risk during project implementation is that the financial restructuring
program for SONELGAZ may not be implemented as envisaged; this risk is
addressed through the financial and other covenants which form part of the
legal agreements.

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Financial Performance and Present Position
4.01     SONELGAZ's consolidated financial performance and position steadily
deteriorated during the last decade. The utility's history has been marked
by periodic financial crises followed by financial rehabilitation schemes of
limited scope and effect. Between 1976 and 1980, SONELGAZ went through two
financial restructurings which failed to restore and maintain long-term
financial equilibrium. Negative net internal cash generatIon, high
debt/equity and low debt service coverage ratios, remained constant features
of SONELGAZ's financial performance. The utility, nonetheless, continued to
incur ever increasing amounts of debts to carry out its ambitious
construction program.
4.02     Despite partial restructuring measures in 1980, that included the
conversion of short and medium-term debt into long-term debt, cancellation
of interest payments on Government loans, and reduction of deferred interest
charges in the balance sheet, SONELGAZ was still in no position to meet all
its debt service obligations. As a result, loan repayments to Banque
Algerienne de Developpement (BAD), SONELGAZ's main sponsor, were suspended
unilateraly. At the end of 1986 outstanding principal and interest arrears
amounted to about AD 2 billion. Net internal cash generation was negative
during 1985 - 1986 and the debt service coverage ratio below 1.0.
4.03     SONELGAZ's consolidated financial statements for the last three
fiscal years (1984-1986) are shown in Annex 4.1. Key indicators of its
financial performance during those years are summarized below:

/b  Including adjustment for exchange losses on long- and medium-term debt
which are normally not recorded by SONELGAZ.



- 28 -
4.04     SONELGAZ's poor financial condition is due to a variety of factors,
notably its inability to raise tarifts (paras. 4.05 and 4.14); a policy of
financing capital investment to a large extent through loans rather than
through Government equity capital contributions (para. 4.14), and the
introduction starting in 1980 of a new income tax system that resulted for
the utility in effective taxation rates between 62% and 80% (para. 4.20).
Combined with serious public sector arrears problems (para. 4.06) this
culminated in the present financial crisis.
4.05     The Bank has, under previous loans, tried to tackle the task of
improving SONELGAZ'S financial situation. Under the first power project
(Loan 997-AL, 1974), Government agreed to take all steps necessary to
achieve a sound financial position. Such steps included among others,
tariff adjustments for SONELGAZ to attain. for it,. electri'e4tv ytfiArttieXC _
cash generation ratio of 15% until 1977 and a financial rate of return on
average net fixed assets in operation of 7% thereafter. Government agreed
to extend these covenants mnder the second power project (Loan 1293-AL,
1976). To achieve the covenanted financial targets, it was agreed that
tariff increases estimated at that time by the Bank at an average o0 43%
over the period 1977-1.980, would be implemented. SONELGAZ could not comply
with these covenants because Government deferred adjusting the tariffs untiL
1980, when it decreed an average 60% increase in both electricity and gas
rates to be implemented in three stages through January 1, 1982. Some
improvements were noted at the end of 1980 as a result of these first late
increases and the restructuring of the balance sheet (para. 4.03). The
rate of return and cash generation ratio became positive (3.9% and 3.9%
respectively) and the debt service coverage ratio rose above 1.0. However,
these results were only temporary. The rate increase for low voltage (LV)
consumers was withdrawn shortly after its implementation as the resulting
tariffs were, in Government's view, socially unacceptable (para 2.05); this
notwithstanding the fact that these tariffs were still only at their 1964
level in nominal terms. There have been no tariff increases since then
(para. 4.14).
Public Sector Arrears
4.06     A most persistent problem for SONELGAZ has been that of arrears
from central and local Government and large public sector enterprises. A
summary is given below:

/a Total receivables balances at year end on account of works and services
are in fact arrears since all works and services should, according to
SONELGAZ's policy, be paid for in full by the time the work is
commissioned or the service rendered.
4.07     At the end of 1986, arrears for electricity and gas consumption
amounted to over five months of annual billings to Government, and arrears
for works and services were equivalent to over 60% of annual biilings.
Repeated efforts by SONELGAZ to collect from the Government were-not
effective. To ensure expeditious settlement of public enterprise arrears, a
nation-wide problem in Algeria, the Ministry of Finance *ssued a decree in
1982-83, allowing all public enterprises to have their banks collect
receivables on their behalf from their debtors' accounts with other banks,
or from their central budget allocations. However, the decree was abrogated
in 1985 due to numerous abuses. SONELGAZ was in fact worse off, since its
bank accounts were incorrectly debited by other public enterprises. As of
December 31, 1986, about AD 400 million worth of such debits were still
under litigation.
4.08     Aware that the timely collection of receivables is a key factor to
SONELGAZ's financial recovery, Government has addressed the issue as part of
SONELGAZ's financial restructuring p'lan. One clause of the restructuring
agreement states that SONELGAZ shall not maintain receivable balances at
year-end in excess of an amount equivalent to two months of its annual
sales. However, the clause does not indicate how this should be achieved and



- 30 -
contains specifically no Government commitments to reduce its own arrears.
During negotiations, Government indicated that a new legal framework was
being developed as an integral part of the ongoing economic reforms (para.
1.24). Implementation of the new 'code de commerce' would lead to the
establishment of normal commercial relations between all public enterprises
(Societ6s Nationales). It is expected that SONELGAZ will be allowed to
disconnect services to any other public entity in case of non-payment
without government interference. SONELGAZ agreed during negotiations to
adopt a more aggressive collection policy to ensure timnely payment by all
its customers, and specifically, to reduce its customers' receivables levels
to 2 mor,ths of billings by 1991 according to an agreed action plan (paras.
4.13-6.04). In addition, and because all government bodies largely
contributed to the arrears and, in view of their magnitude, agreement was
obtained from government that it would assist SONELGAZ with all measures
necessary to (i) settle, by December 31, 1990, all overdue receivables due
to SONELGAZ as of December 31, 1987; (ii) establish, starting in 1988,
procedures such that amounts due to SONELGAZ by its administrative
subdivisions on accou;nt of sales of electricity and gas should not exceed,
at year end, two months of the total of such sales during the year
(para. 6.02); and (iii) cause all public bodies to pay their bills to
SONELGAZ for works and services within 30 days ot their due date (para.
6.02).
Loans to Former Operational Units
4.09     As of January 1, 1984 six of SONELGAZ's former operational units
were set up as independent public enterprises (para. 1.11). Agreement was
reached between SONELGAZ and the newly established companies that their
liabilities vis-a-vis SONELGAZ relating to: (i) their respective shares of
external debt would continue to be centrally ,nanaged by SONELGAZ, to whom
they would repay interest and principal payments made on their behalf, while
local debt would immediately be transferred to the companies' own books; and
(ii) goods and services delivered prior to the restructuring would be fully
repaid to SONELGAZ by June 1986.
4.10     Because most of the newly established entities are in extremely
poor financial shape, ani although transfer of the debt portion of the
outstanding claims was made during 1987 SONELGAZ's balance sheet at the end
of 1987, still shows claims amounting to about AD 350 million against these
companies. SONELGAZ continues to have business dealings with the companies
and is, in some cases, their only custorer. Therefore, agreement was
reached during negotiations that SONELGAZ will take all measures necessary
to collect the remaining balances from the concerned entities by December
31, 1989 (para. 6.04).
Future Financial Performance
Financial Restructuring Plan
4.11     To tackle SONELGAZ's immediate problems, Government has approved  a
financial restructuring of the entity, within the context of the general and
extensive economic reforms that are being implemented. The restructuring



- 31 -
plan would, under certain conditions which ara further discussed in
paragraph 4.14 below, provide SONELGAZ with adequate means of achieving long
term financial equilibrium. Although it fails to define a new framework for
the relationship between Government and SONELGAZ, which is presently marked
by a total lack of autonomy for the utility, the plan does provide the basis
for a possible future contract-program, a possibility which is reportedly
being envisaged under the new public enterprises law, and would be a
prerequisite to any future Bank operation in the power subsector.
4.12     The plan was developed by SONELGAZ's management together with the
National Commission for Financial Restructuring. The ensuing recommendations
were approved by the Council of Ministers in early November 1987, and were
partially implemented during 1988.
4.13     The approved measures indicate that Government will:
(a) beginning in 1987, increase energy tariffs by at least 5% each year
until 1992. A 10% increase which is to be implemented during 1988
to make up for 1987 (para. 4.14) has been made a condition of
effectiveness (para. 6.01). During negotiations, Government
indicated that the approved 5% tariff increase constitutes a
guaranteed minimum above which, further increases could be
envisaged should SONELGAZ's financial situation warrant it and
provided prevailing conditions allow such increases (para. 4.15);
(b) grant a restructuring loan of AD 1.5 billion to SONELGAZ to pay off
its most urgent debt obligations. This loan bears interest at 2.5%
per annum over a period of 15 years with a 2-year grace period;
(c) convert outstanding AD 1.321 billion in BAD loans into equity
contribution; and
(d) extend up to a maximum of 25 years, the maturities of all loans
granted to SONELGAZ by BAD between 1980 and 1985.
Concurrently, SONELGAZ is to achieve greater operational efficiency through:
(a) reducing the level of its inventories to six months annual
consumption in 1988, down from 14 months in 1986.  This is an
overly ambitious objective given all the practical problems
involved. A more realistic set of targets was agreed with SONELGAZ,
which includes achievement of a 6 months inventory level by 1992
and specific intermediate targets to monitor progress. To comply
with the agreed action plan, SONELGAZ is currently developing a
more efficient inventory management system which would, among other
things, tackle the existing inventory recording problem by allowing
proper initial classification of each item either as investment or
inventory;



- 32 -
(b)  reducing its customer receivables from five months of annual
billings in 1986 to two months in 1988; again this is an objective
which the utility cannot realistically achieve. It was agreed
instead, during negotiations, that SONELGAZ will achieve this
target by 1991, a date by which all Government arrears would have
been settled (para. 4.08) and SONELGAZ's new collection policy
fully operational;
(c)  cutting back on all operating expenditures.  Specific targets are
set for each category of expenses; and
(d)  depreciating fixed assets over a shorter period of time (25 years
instead of 30 years on average). This would reduce taxable income
(para. 4.18) and hence improve cash generation.
Tariffs
4.14     SONELCAZ's electricity tariffs have remained unchanged since 1964
for the low-voltage category (para. 4.05) and since 1982 for the medium and
high-voltage categories (the same applies to the gas tariffs). The tariffs
were designed to be sufficient only to finance replacement and routine
development; all major works were being financed either by grants (Rural
Electrification program and public distribution of gas up to 1984) or,
mostly, by loans through state banks. This policy can no longer be
sustained if SONELGAZ is to become financially viable, a view that is now
generally accepted in Algeria as evidenced by the ongoing reform process.
During negotiations, Government stated its commitment to a public enterprise
reform which would create the basic conditions for fostering increased
financial as well as managerial autonomy for all public enterprises (PE's).
The specific measures such reforms would entail are still being worked out
and could include partial or full transfer to Government of existing public
enterprise debt, new capital injections, periodic tariff adjustments over
and above those already approved in the course of individual restructuring
schemes, and operating as well as investment subsidies. At this stage it
would be hazardous, at best, to try to anticipate the specific set of
measures that will be taken for any particular PE, since the scope and
schedule of implementation of the intended reforms will heavily depend,
among other things, upon the availability of budgetary resources allocated
to all PE's most of which are in as poor a financial shape as SONELGAZ.
4.15     In view of these uncertainties, the Bank's strategy concerning
SONELGAZ, has been to agree on general financial principles and on short
term financial objectives which are easily monitorable, realistic and likely
to be met within the project's timeframe. The financial restructuring
measures, once fully implemented, should promote greater financial
discipline in the conduct of SONELGAZ's future financing strategy.
Government's endorsement, through its approval of these measures, of a
policy designed to achieve a more systematic match between the utility's
local financing terms and the life of its assets, is in that respect, very
encouraging and an indication of a notable shift from past policies as well
as a willingness to restore and maintain the utility's financial equilibrium
through sound financial management.



- 33 -
4.16  During negotiations, Government further indicated that SONELGAZ would,
in the future, be duly compensated for shortfalls in revenues resulting from
inadequate tariffs. In other words, should implementation of tariff
increases over and above the guaranteed minimum prove, in Government's view,
unfeasible, SONELGAZ would receive compensation adequate to fulfill its
obligations. Strict observance of this principle should provide the minimum
conditions for ensuring improved financial performance for SONELGAZ in the
future as evidenced by the positive reversal in the trend of its financial
indicators; a positive net cash generation, and a debt service coverage
ratio consistently above 1.1 (paras. 4.19 and 4.22).
4.17 The forecasts assume (i) that the required cash generation levels
(para. 4.19) would be achieved solely by means of tariff adjustments
estimated to amount to a total of 60% in nominal terms for the 1988-1995
period and (ii) that tariff increases will take place on January 1 of each
year. The resulting financial performance indicators are summarized in
Table 4.4. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine
the financial implications of tariff adjustments limited to the annual 5%
already secured through the financial restructuring and which would amount
to 35% in nominal terms over the same period. The related financial tables
and results are shown in Annex 4.2, and indicate that Government would in
such event have to provide SONELGAZ with additional financial assistance
(debt service transfer) totalling AD 7.8 billion.
4.18 SONELGAZ's forecast financial statements for 1988-1995 are shown in
Annex 4.1. Its financing plan for that period is summarized below:

Net Internal Cash Generation
4.19     During the project implementation period, SONELGAZ should achieve
net internal cash generation levels sufficient to finance 7% of its
investment program, excluding consumers contributions A', and Government
contributions for the national electrification program; a significant
improvement over past performance.   During negotiations, agreement was
reached that Government and SONELGAZ will take all necessary actions,
including but not limited to tariff adjustments, to enable SONELGAZ to
achieve a net internal cash generation ratio equivalent to at least, 3% in
1990, 7% in 1991, 132 in 1992, and 15% in 1993 and thereafter, on its
consolidated investment program (gas and electricity) on a moving three year
average basis (para. 6.03). Government and SONELGAZ also agreed to: (a)
review at least three months before the end of each fiscal year the adequacy
of the utility's estimated revenues to achieve the agreed net internal cash
generation ratio for the following year; and (b) determine on the basis of
the above review, the measures required to achieve the agreed ratio and
consult with the Bank on these measures and their implementation schedule
before the beginning of that fiscal year (para. 6.03).
Income Taxes
4.20     Since 1980, SONELGAZ is required to file a separate income tax
return for each of its thirteen operational units, separately rather than on
a consolidated basis. The new procedure has prevented SONELGAZ from
offsetting surpluses and deficits generated by its different operational
units.  This has resulted for the utility in taxation rates between 622 and
80% which far exceed the official 55% income tax rate, thereby significantly
reducing cash generation.  During negotiations, Covernment indicated that
fiscal reform was one of the main components of the new public enterprises'
law and that provisions likely to significantly reduce the burden of direct
taxation on PEs were being envisaged.
Debt Management
4.21     SONELGAZ's financial performance should be such as to allow
SONELGAZ to service its debt adequately without impairing its self-financing
ability. During negotiations, agreement was reached that SONELGAZ would
generate net resources for each year starting in 1990 consistent with the
covenanted cash generation ratios, and adequate to service all its debt
incurred or to be incurred (para. 6.04). SONELGAZ's debt service coverage
ratio is expected to rise from 0.9 in 1986 to 1.4 in 1993 and would
thereafter remain satistactory.
1/ Consumers generally contribute between 60 and 90% toward the cost of
connections.

Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards
4.23     SONELGAZ is organized into thirteen operational units, nine of
which are regional offices located in the main urban centers. Each unit has
its own Accounting Department which reports directly to a central accounting
division within the Finance Department at Headquarters. Although partial
cost accounting for some activities has been introduced, its general
accounts are kept on a consolidated basis, in accordance with the
requirements of the national accounting system (Plan Comptable Algerien).
4.24    'SONELGAZ's accounting practices and procedures are not
satisfactory. The utility has experienced difficulties in trying to justify
the outstanding balance of some major accounts, such as accounts
receivable. Customer accounts are managed by the Customers Department,
which keeps a parallel record of billings and collections. As there was no
attempt, until recently, to reconcile its manual records with the accounting
balances, major discrepancies exist. The internal control unit is currently
imolementing an exhaustive work program to investigate discrepancies and
Llean up all accounts by 1989 (para. 4.24).
4.25     Under loans 997-AL and 1293-AL, the Bank was unable to obtain
financial statements showing the annual results for electricity, gas and
other miscellaneous operations separately. These difficulties stemmed from
the fact that the Bank's reporting requirements were not geared to



- 37 -
SONELGAZ's financial information system which reports only on its
consolidated operations (para. 4.21). To avoid such problems from
recurring, it is proposed that SONELGAZ's consolidated financial results
serve as the basis for monitoring its financial performance until separation
of electricity and gas accounts is implemented after completion of the
proposed accounting system study (para. 4.28).
Internal Auditing
4.26     Although SONELGAZ does not have an internal auditing unit as such,
it operates under a fairly stringent system of internal controls. The
"Division d'Inspection Comptable", within the Finance Department prepares
each year a confidential inspection plan that determines which units'
accounts and procedures are to be reviewed. The inspection covers such
areas as contracting, procurement procedures, customer credit policies, etc.
Each year individual accounts are selected for review in order to obtain
reconciliation between physical inventory and accounting balances. A
program to clean up the accounts is underway for the period 1985-1989.
External Audjitig
4.27     Until 1978, SONELGAZ's accounts were audited by a statutory auditor
(commisse.ire aux comptes) designated by the Ministry of Finance. This
arrangement was found acceptable under the two previous Bank loans although
the audit reports were invariably issued with considerable delays. Since
that date, however, all audit responsibilities were transferred to the Cour
des Comptes. Because of staff shortage, the "our des Comptes has so far
never issued an annual report on SONELGAZ. As a result, the Bank's audit
requirements have not since then been complied with. To avoid the
recurrence of such problems, alternative audit arrangements were discussed
with SONELGAZ. The Societe Nationale de Comptabilite (SNC), a
Government-owned auditing firm, is presently the only Accounting and
Auditing firm of importance operating in Algeria.   SNC has already been
selected as auditor under a number of Bank projects. It has a staff of 280,
and branches in eighteen cities throughout Algeria.   During negotiations,
agreement was reached that SONELGAZ's accounts will be audited, from fiscal
year 1987 onwards, by auditors acceptable to the Bank and that its financial
statements and audit reports be furnished to the Bank no later than nine
months after year end (para. 6.04).
Billing and Collection
4.28     Meter reading and billing for low voltage and low pressure
customers are done on a quarterly rotating basis for electricity and gas
simultaneously. Industrial customers are billed monthly. Bills a.-e issued
about two weeks after meter reading and show separate amounts for
electricity and gas. Private customers are normally disconnected if payment
is not made within 15 days of billing (i.e. about 1 month after meter
reading). Payment can be made to the meter readers who present the bill,
via banks, at SONELGAZ's offices and, since recently, via electronic funds
transfers with the Comptes de Cheques Postaux (CCP). Past collection



- 38 -
performance has been quite satisfactory for private customers, but serious
problems exist with respect to the public sector (para. 4.06).
Management and Accounting Systems
4.29     SONELGAZ's Management and accounting systems have in recent years
proven to be inadequate in view of the utility's formidable expansion over
the last decade (para. 1.13) and after the major reorganizations it
underwent (para. 1.11). The geographical dispersion of the offices, the
lack of uniform standards of reporting among the different operational
units, and the need for accurate and readily available debt service data,
have exacerbated the deficiencies of the present system. Many financial and
operational reports are being issued on a monthly or annual basis but are
not always geared to existing needs. Aware of these shortcomings, and in
order to begin to correct them (para. 4.28), management recently acquired
four microcomputers for the Finance Department to help prepare a reli&ble
data base. High on the priority list are the computerization of the debt
service and the development of a financial forecasting model and a
computerized cash management system. However, these tasks have so far
lagged behind due to the insufficient number of computers.   Therefore, the
proposed project would finance the acquisition of microcomputers and
appropriate software packages for the Finance Department to improve
SONELGAZ's day to day management and accelerate the computerization
process. (para 3.02)
4.30     In addition, and to help SONELGAZ introduce a comprehensive and
efficient management system and a new accounting framework, a study will be
carried out under the proposed project. The study will (i) review present
and future information needs and assess the strengths and weaknesses of the
current accounting system; (ii) design an integrated and computerized
Management information system (MIS), and (iii) explore and recommend an
alternative accounting system better suited to the utility's ueeds. During
negotiations agreement was reached that SONELGAZ take all steps necessary to
appoint by June 30, 1989 qualified consultants satisfactory to the Bank, to
carry out the study (Terms of reference in annex 4.4). The study will be
carried out in two phases according to the following action plan:
(i)  the first phase will assess the strengths and weaknesses of the
existing accounting and Management information systems and their
adequacy to future needs, and should be completed not later than
June 30, 1990; and
(ii) the second phase, will make recommendations for more appropriate
systems and related implementation schedule and should be completed
not later than June 30, 1991. Implementation of these
recommendations by SONELGAZ would start thereafter (para. 6.04).
Finance Staff and Training
4.31     SONELGAZ's Finance Department is headed by a competent and
experienced management team. Staffing at the intermediate and lower levels
is however, inadequate. The utility has been experiencing some difficulties



- 39 -
in attracting and retaining suitable candidates because of: (i) a limited
supply of people educated in accounting and finance in Algeria; and
(ii) high turnover of existing staff because of less stringent grading
systems and better promotion opportunities offered by other public
enterprises. Government has recently taken steps to introduce a uniform
grading system in the public sector; it is expected that SONELGAZ will
benefit from this through reduced staff turnover. In addition, SONELGAZ is
planning to undertake, under the proposed project, a manpower development
study which would aim, among other things, at reducing staff turn-over
(para. 2.03)
4.32     SONELGAZ has an excellent training program for financial and
accounting staff. In fact, the high quality of accounting staff training at
SONELGAZ is reportedly the main reason why there is such a high staff
turnover upon completion of the training program. The training center,
located at Ben Aknoun, offers a wide range of courses including seminars on
specific subjects of topical interest, refresher courses, as well as a full
time two-year program leading to a nationally recognized degree in
Accounting or Finance. However, because of staff turnover problems the
Finance Department presently does niot wish to meet the training needs of all
staff, especially newly recruited employees; traini:.g of the latter is
therefore, usually performed on the job. There is, however, a need to: (i)
strengthen the skills of intermediate level staff in the areas of financial
management and planning and in auditing; and (ii) train selected staff in
microcomputer programming - a field which is presently not included in the
Ben Aknoun Curriculum. Adequate funding has been provided under the
proposed project for staff training in selected areas including finance,
auditing and programming (para 2.04).
Insurance
4.33     SONELGAZ carries insurance adequately covering the risks of public
utility enterprises. Assets are insured against the risks of fire,
explosion and other electrical incidents. The policies are with a
state-owned company - Compagnie Alg6rienne d'Assurance (CAAR), and also
include workman's compensation and third party liability of the utility's
operations.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
5.01     The primary justification for the project lies in the support it
brings to the financial restructuring of SONELGAZ. Under the restructuring
SONELGAZ will move from a position of negative net internal cash generation
to achieving increasingly positive levels. The economic justification for
the project rests on two analyses. The first demonstrates that the
transmission component is an integral part of the least-cost investment plan
for meeting the projected growth in electricity demand. The second analysis
concludes that there would be an adequate economic rate of return on the
time slice of electricity investment of which the proposed project is a part.
Demand Justification
5.02     The load forecasts used in this evaluation were prepared with the
assistance of SONELGAZ (Annex 2.5). The high voltage forecast is based o.? a
detailed survey by SONELGAZ of existing and proposed new customers. The
low-voltage forecast was derived using SONELGAZ methods from forecasts of
population, number of households (based on a projected decline in the number
of persons per household from 7.7 in 1987 to 7.4 in 1996), the rate of
electrification (rising from 73% of households in 1986 to about 902 in 1996)
and an average consumption per customer (rising from 1260 kWh per year in
1986 to 1684 kWh in 1996). The medium-voltage forecast was prepared by
applying elasticities (calculated from historical data) of electricity
consumption to value added in four economic sectors to economic growth rates
projected by Bank staff. Upward adjustments were made for the early years
in the forecast period to reflect the effects of a campaign to reduce
non-technical losses. The forecasts take into account, on the one hand, the
impact on industrial electricity demand of the slowdown in economic growth
caused by the fall in international oil prices in 1986, and, on the other
hand, the continued rapid growth of low-voltage demand resulting from a high
rate of new connections, which is expected to continue for some time because
of a backlog of unsatisfied requests. However, no adjustments were made to
take account of the impact of changing electricity prices on demand since
consumers have shown little response up to now to demand management
incentives embodied in the tariff structure (para 2.09). Within a
reasonable range of variation of demand about the forecast, the optimal
timing of the proposed project would be unaffected.
Least Cost Investment Program
5.03     Generation.  SONELGAZ generation and transmission investment plans
are based on parameters established in a long term master plan issued in
March 1983. The study used state of the art optimization techniques to
choose a range of reliability criteria for system expansion and
demand-related thresholds for the transition to larger unit sizes for new
plant on the generation system. In the medium to long term, the present
generation investment plan conforms well with the optimal parameters
determined by the study.



- 41 -
5.04     One option not considered in the master plan study was the
possibility of introducing gas-fired combined-cycle plant, either to
displace some of the conventional steam plant scheduled for commissioning in
the mid 1990s, or by retrofitting existing steam plant as part of a
rehabilitation program. Over the last few years, both capital and operating
costs for combined-cycle plant have fallen relative to conventional steam
turbines. In order to evaluate the combined-cycle alternative, SONELGAZ has
started a detailed investigation to determine the assumptions to be used for
evaluating the possible introduction of combined-cycle plant in its future
investment program. This will now be developed into a comprehensive study
as part of the technical assistance component of the Project (para. 3.02)
Draft TORs for the proposed study are attached in Annex 5.1.
5.05     Transmission.  Developirent of a 220-kV grid started in 1977.  The
1983 master plan compared a number of strategies for the location and size
of future generation and transmission plant. Generation plant locations
were chosen to achieve regional balance between supply and demand - to
minimize the transit requirement on the transmission system - except in
case- where a deviation could be justified by lower generation costs.
With   this framework, the main transmission options considered were:
(a) a 220-kV system designed to minimize transmission capital costs;
(b) a 220-kV system with a "backbone" through the Hauts Plateaux; and
(c) transition to a 400-kV system.
5.06     The total capital and operating costs (including losses and costs
of non-supply) of all options were compared; system performance under a
range of fault conditions was also verified. The first option was found to
be the least-cost solution and was adopted as the basis for transmission
planning until the year 2000. Within this framework, SONELGAZ has drawn up
a detailed medium-term development plan which is divided into four regions.
The plan is revised over a four-year cycle - one region per year. In 1986,
SONELGAZ revised the long term transmission master plan to accommodate the
loadflows foreseen in the first half of the 1990s. The Bank has reviewed
the studies and found them to be satisfactory. The proposed project is an
integral part of the revised master plan, which would not be affected by the
outcome of the study indicated in para. 5.04 and would therefore remain the
least-cost solution.
5.07     Over the past several years, the transmission system has been
subject to unusually high interregional power transits - and corresponding
losses - mainly as a result of delays in commissioning new generating plant
and unplanned outages at existing stations. Timely completion of the
transmission reinforcement will provide improved security and lower losses
during any such future incidents.
5.08     Distribution.  The distribution directorates have recently been
short staffed and generally overwhelmed by short-term imperatives such as
reducing a very large backlog of requests for new connections in urban
areas, and meeting the targets of the rural electrification program. In
1985, SONELGAZ started upgrading its distribution planning capability. This
began with a program of load and loss measurement throughout the system, to
provide a basis for leveloping regional distribution master plans. The main
objective is to improve the quality of electricity supply to final
consumers. The completion of the regional distribution master plans should
provide a good framework within which to design least-cost investment
programs for future distribution infrastructure.

Return on Investment
5.09     Since the project forms an integral part of SONELGAZ's investment
program, the economic rate of return was calculated for a timeslice of
SONELGAZ's overall electricity investment program corresponding to the
forecast additional demand for electricity over the period of the Project
implementation (1989-95) (details in Annex 5.2).
5.10     The measurable costs comprise:  (a) the capital costs of
generation, transmission and distribution needed to meet additional
electricity demand over the period 1989-95; (b) non-fuel operating and
maintenance (0.& M.) costs; and (c) the fuel cost of incremental thermal
generation. O.& M. and fuel costs are taken into account during the
construction period and for the assumed 30-year life of the assets
(1990-2020).   Fuel costs are based on the economic cost of natural gas
(para. 1.24) and on the international price of gas oil.
5.11     Measurable benefits are limited to the incremental electricity
sales revenues during the project construction period, and are constant
thereafter during the life of the assets. Tariff adjustments were projected
in line with the financial restructuring measures approved by the
Government. Given the uncertainties surrounding the effects of the economic
reforms ncw under way (in particular, the pace at which the existing
extensive price controls in the rest of the economy will be lifted and the
anticipated movements in overall wage and price levels), the Government
decided on only those actions needed to meet initial financial objectives
for SONELGAZ. The corresponding tariff increases will still leave
electricity prices below economic cost. The Government recognizes that it
may be necessary to raise electricity prices further, but these possible
increases were not taken into account in the economic analysis.
5.12     Under the above assumptions, the economic rate of return on the
investment program is about 6.3X, which is below the estimated opportunity
cost of capital in Algeria of 102.   This result reflects the valuation of
benefits using tariff rates which are below LRMC. However, inclusion of the
full consumers' surplus in the economic benefit calculations would yield a
considerably higher rate of return of about 202 (Annex 5.2).

VI. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      Implementation of a tariff increase of l0% will be a condition of
effectiveness (para. 4.13).
6.02     During negotiations, the Government agreed to assist SONELGAZ with
all measures necessary to settle, by December 31, 1990, all overdue
receivables due to SONELGAZ as of December 31, 1987; establish procedures
such that amounts due to SONELGAZ by its administrative subdivisions on
account of sales of electricity and gas should not exceea, at year end, two
months of the total such sales during the year; and ensure that government
and public sector enterprises would pay their bills to SONELGAZ for works
and services within 30 days of their due date (para. 4.08).
6.03     During negotiations, the Government and SONELGAZ agreed to:
(a) take all necessary actions, including but t.At limited to tariff
adjustments, to enable SONELGAZ to achieve a net internal cash
generation ratio equivalent to at least 32 in 1990, 7% in 1991, 13%
in 1992 and 152 in 1993 and thereafter, on its consolidated
investment program (gas and electricity) a;-d on a moving three-year
average basis (para. 4.19); and
(b)  review at least three months before the end of each fiscal year the
adequacy of the utility's revenues to achieve the agreed net
internal cash generation ratio for the following year and determine
on the basis of the above review, the mea.ures required to achieve
the agreed ratio and consult with the Bank on these measures and on
their implementation schedule before the beginning of that fiscal
year (para. 4.19).
6.04     During negotiations, SONELGAZ:
(a)  agreed to submit to the Bank not later than December 31, 1988 a
detailed staff training program and its implementation schedule
(para. 2.04);
(b)  agreed to appoint by June 30, 1989 consultants to undertake a loss
reduction study and to review with Lhe Bank before June 30, 1991
the recommended action plan to reduce the level of losses and to
implement the agreed recommendations. (para. 2.15);
(c)  agreed to exchange views with the Bank on its investment program as
part of its annual review of load forecasts and investment program
(para. 2.18);
(d)  confirmed that the required land for the four substations would be
acquired not later than December 31, 1988 (para. 3.09);



- 44 -
(e) agreed to open and maintain in US Dollars a special account of
US$8.0 million in a major commercial bank or in the Central Bank of
Algeria on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 3.15);
(f) agreed to adopt a more aggressive collection policy to ensure
timely payment by all its customers and to reduce its customers'
receivables levels to two months of billing by 1991 (para. 4.08);
(g) agreed to ensure settlement of the unpaid balances due by its
former operational units on account of goods and services delivered
to those entities by December 31, 1989 (para. 4.10);
(h) agreed to generate net resources for each year starting in 1990
consistent with the covenanted cash generation ratios, and adequate
to service all its debt incurred or to be incurred. (para 4.21);
(i) agreed to have its accounts audited from fiscal year 1987 onwards
by auditors acceptable to the Bank and to have its financial
statements and Audit Reports furnished to the Bank no later than
nine months after the year's end (para. 4.27); and
(j) agreed to take all steps necessary to employ qualified consultants
by June 30, 1989 upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank, to carry out a management and accounting systems study. The
first phase of the study will assess the existing systems and
should be completed by June 30, 1990. The second phase, will make
recommendations for more appropriate systems and related
implementation schedule and should be completed not later than June
30, 1991. Implementation of these recommendations by SONELGAZ
should start thereafter.
6.05     With the above agreements the proposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$160.0 million for a term of 15 years at the standard
variable interest rate including a five-year grace period, to the Borrower
SONELGAZ with a guarantee of the Government of Algeria.

Manpower Development Study
Draft Terms of Reference
1.       The study shall be executed in 2 stages, the first the "diagnostic"
stage, the second the "implementation" stage.
Phase 1
2.       SONELGAZ's present organization, its institution practices, its work
methods and procedures shall be studied and reviewed with particular attention
to: manpower availability and use, division of responsibilities, recruitment,
employment and remuneration practices, flow of information and documents
related to this, work hours practices (theoretical and effective), expertise
of higher and middle echelon personnel and training. The objective of the
study is to define the requirements for improving: staff morale and
dedication, the sharing of responsibilities at all levels (with specific
guidelines for the decisions to be assigned to staff at such levels),
planning, budgeting and control of works to be executed, operational and
maintenance services and to develop an organization to achieve this objective.
3.       Recommendations shall be prepared on the basis of the consultants'
findings for:

THIRD POWER PROJECT
Long-Run Marginal Cost of Electricity (LRMC)
1.           For the purpose of comparing tariffs to the economic cost of
electricity, estimates were made of the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of
electricity supplied by SONELGAZ. These are preliminary calculations
intended to determine only whether the LRMC is significantly greater or
less than average revenue at the low, medium and high voltage levels. 1/
The assumptions used in the analysis are set out here.
Marginal Capacity Cost of Generation
2.           The marginal cost of power supply is the change in total cost of
service resulting from a small change in demand. In the short run, the
installed capacities of the system are given and an increase in demand
would lead to increased fuel or voltage costs. In the long run,
investments can be made to satisfy the increased demand. In Algeria, an
increased demand on the interconnected network during peak periods would
normally require additional combustion turbine capacity. The marginal
capacity cost at generation was calculated using the following assumptions
to be AD 475 /kW/year:
Investment cost: AD 2500/kW
Discount rate:    10%
Interest during construction: 21%
Equipment life: 20 years
Reserve margin: 251
0 & M: 1.52 of investment cost.
Marginal Energy Cost
3.           Combustion turbines are the marginal generating units during peak
and shoulder periods, while steam turbines are often the marginal units at
night. The average incremental heat rate for all marginal plant on the
interconnected system is approximately 2200 kcal/kWh. Assuming that the
economic cost of natural gas is $1.00/million Btu's (para. 1.24), the
marginal energy cost at all times of the day and year would be AD 0.043/
kWh.
1/ Detailed estimates of LRMC at the generation level will be prepared by
SONELGAZ in the context of the UNDP-World Bank Energy Planning Project.

Energy Losses
4.           Transmission Losses are assumed to decline from levels of about
6.5% of net generation since 1985 to 5%. The high recent loss rates are
due to abnormal transfers of energy caused by a temporary geographical
mismatch of available capacity and demand. Distribution losses are
assumed to be 10% of energy delivered to the distribution network after
deducting 3 percentage points for ion-technical losses.
Marginal Capacity Cost of Transmission
5.           Transmission investments in 1987 prices and incremental Loads are
projected as follows for the years 1987 through 1990 (Annexes 2.7 and 2.4):
Transmission    Incremental
Investment       Demand
(AD Million)      (MW)
1987            460              173
1988            826              103
1989            942              584
1990           1024              200
6.                          The marginal capacity cost of transmission was
calculated using these data and the average incremental cost
method according to which the marginal cost per kW was calculated
as the ratio of the present value of transmission investments (AD
2760 million) divided by the present value of incremental demand
(900 MW). Assuming a 30 year life for transmission facilities
and an annual 0 + M cost equal to 1% of the investment cost,
marginal transmission capacity cost is estimated to be AD
356/kW/year.
Marginal Capacity Cost of Distribution
7.                          Distribution investments in 1987 prices and
incremental loads are projected as follows for the year 1987
through 1990 (Annexes 2.7 and 2.4).
Distribution    Incremental
Investment       Demand
(AD Million)    (MW)
1987            1671              135
1988            1487              137
1989            1197              158
1990             793              170

8.           The investment estimates exclude connection costs to the extent
thaE these are financed by separate contributions from customers. Because
of complications caused by the connection of some isolated networks to the
interconnected grid during the forecast period, incremental demand was
calculated from aggregate sales projections in GWh for LV and MV customers
adjusted by adding distribution losses and converting to megawatt demand
assuming (in the absence of better data) that the load factor for LV and
MV customers is the same as the average for the interconnected system
(60%). For lack of data, separate estimates were not made for LV and MV
customers. Assuming a 30 year life for distribution facilities and an
annual 0 + M cost equal to 1t of the investment cost, marginal
distribution capacity cost for MV and LV customers is estimated using the
average incremental cost method to be AD 1031/kW/year.
LRMC Summary
9.           LRPMC estimates per kWh averaged over peak, shoulder and off-peak
periods are summarized as follows, assuming a load factor of 602 for all
customers (all costs are marginal):
(AD/kWh, 1987 prices)
Generation capacity and 0 + M costs                      0.090
Energy cost                                             0.043
Generation cost                                          0.133
Transmission capacity and 0 + M cost                     0.068
Total adjusted for 5% transmission loss                  0.211
Distribution capacity and 0 + M cost                     0.196
Total adjusted for 10% distribution loss                0.448
Assuming 322 of sales by SONELGAZ at HV (estimate for 1987) and the rest
at MV and LV, the weighted average LRMC is AD 0.372 /kWh.
LRMC Compared to Price
10. The LRMC estimates are compared to average revenue per kWh as follows:
(1)              (2)              2/1
(AD, 1987 prices)
LRMC         Revenue/kWh a/        (2)
High voltage                      0.211         0.161                  76

Low voltage                            )        0.396
Weighted average                  0.372         0.261                  70
a/ SONELGAZ estimates for 1986. These estimates are approximately valid for
1987 since no change in tariff rates occurred in that year.

Adjustment for Temporary Excess Capacity
11.          Additions of generating capacity in 1988, 1990, 1991 and 1992 are
likely to result in some excess capacity until 1994. Thus a small
additional demand would not require further new generating capacity until
1994. An adjustment may be made to the LRMC estimates to reflect the
temporary excess. The present value in 1987 of the investment in new
generating capacity would be approximately half the 1994 cost, and the
annuitized cost would be only AD 0.050/kWh compared to the original
estimate of AD 0.090. The following estimates of LRMC incorporate this
adjustment:
Adjusted LRMC
(AD/kWh, 1987 prices)
Generating capacity and 0 + M cost                      0.050
Energy cost                                             0.043
Generation cost                                0.093
Transmission capacity and 0 + M cost                    0.068
Total adjusted for 52 transmission loss                 0.161
Distribution capacity and 0 + M cost                    0.196
Total adjusted for 10X distribution loss                0.357
Weighted average LRMC                                   0.295
Ratio of revenue/kWh to adjusted LRMC                     88%
12.          The adjusted LRMC is a kind of hybrid between LRMC and short-run
marginal cost. It is a long-run measure since it takes account of costs
of new capacity including ge.,erating capacity, and the present value of
the annuities for the new capacity is fully equal to the present value of
the cost of that capacity. However, by adjusting for a temporary surplus,
this measure approaches the short run marginal cost concept, which would
assign a zero value to marginal generating cate ity.  It serves a useful
role in the current Algerian context, as would the short-run concept, by
providing an economic justification for electricity prices set temporarily
below the unadjusted LRMC level. The adjusted measure has a disadvantage,
however, in that the estimated marginal cost would change with every
change between the date when the marginal cost is estimated and the date
when the excess capacity is expected to disappear. For this reason, the
unadjusted estimate is used in the main text of the present report.
Adjustment for Alternative Rate of Foreign Exchange
13.          A sensitivity test was carried out using an exchange rate of US
$1.00 = AD 9.92 (instead of the 1987 rate of US $1.00 = AD 4.96). Under
this assumption the weighted average LRMC becomes AD 0.557/kWh.
SONELGAZ's 1987 revenue of AD 0.261 /kWh is only 472 of this LRMC.

THIRD POWER PROJECT
Power system loss reduction study
Terms of Reference
General Objective of the study
1.         The objective of the study is to define measures to be taken to
implement cost effective modifications to system facilities, operation and
construction standards to improve the technical efficiency of the power system
bv reducing the level of losses and by reviewing existing or starting a new,
organized, continuing loss reduction program, which will keep future losses at
acceptable levels. These Terms of Reference outline the purpose and scope of
the study to be undertaken by Sonelgaz with the assistance of consultants.
The Electricity Supply Sector in Algeria
2.         The Societ6 Nationale d'Electricite et du Gaz (SONELGAZ) is a
publicly owned utility responsible for the overall development and operation
of the power subsector throughout the country and under the supervision of the
Ministry of Energy and Chemical and Petrochemical Industries (MECPT).
3.         The consumption of electricity increased at an overall annual rate
of about 13 between 1975 and 1986. In 1986 the peak demand on the
interconnected system was 2060MW compared to total available capacity of 2930
MW. Electricity consumption is concentrated in the Northern interconnected
system (about 872 of total Sonelgaz electricity sales in 1986) and is evenly
distributed among the three major voltage levels (HV, MV and LV). Sonelgaz
electricity generation system is dominated by gaz-fired plant - steam turbines
on the coast and combustion turbines at inland sites.
4.         The SONELGAZ electricity transmission system consists of:(a) a
220-kV interconnected network, with three active links with Tunisia (at 90 kV
and 150 kV), an inactive 220-kV link with Morocco, and (b) two isolated grids
in the south centered on the two main oil and gas producing areas of Hassi
Messaoud and Hassi R'Mel. At the end of 1985, the transmission network
comprised: (a) 3810 km of 220-kV, 46 km of 150-kV, 397 km of 90-kV and 4425 km
of 60-kV lines; and (b) 3230 MVA and 7148 MVA of substation capacity at power
stations and in the network, respectively. The distribution networks at the
end of 1984 consisted of 40,426 km of medium voltage lines, 34,393 km of low
voltage lines, and 23,353 medium to low voltage transformers.
5.         During the next decade, total electricity sales is forecast to
increase from 10.260 GWh in 1986 to 26.390 GWh in 1996, representing an



- 59 -
ANNEX 2.8
Page 2 of 4
overall average annual growth of about 10% by 1996. Maximum system demand is
forecast to increase from 2060 MW in 1986 to about 5485 MW in 1996.
Scope of the study
6.       The study will, include a plant by plant survey of generating
facilities, sampling diagnostic studies of transmission and distribution
circuits, a critical analysis of transmission and distribution system
standards and practices and a review of customs service activities including
metering and billing.
Procedures
7.       A series of short interviews would be held with members of senior
management. This would show management's policy towards, and goals for, loss
reduction. The information obtained on the principal problems being
encountered would indicate where losses were occurring and what steps were
taken or were contemplated to reduce losses.
8.       The transmission and distribution systems would be examined through
discussions with appropriate staff and site visits to substations, workshops
and other facilities. Available statistics on system performance would be
analyzed.
9.       An assessment of the operating efficiency of thermal generating
plants would be made by site visits and inspection of the equipment and
through discussions and examination of plant and other records.
10.      The information obtained from the above would be analyzed to identify
areas where losses could be reduced; or where more detailed study would be
justified; and changes or additions should be recommended to design criteria
and operating and maintenance procedures. The course of action to implement
these recommendations would be outlined.
Reporting
11.      The results of the study will be presented in a concise report.  The
recommendations will be presented in two phases:
12.      The first phase would be in the form of a short-term Preliminary Loss
Reduction Project which would outline immediate steps to be taken to improve
the most urgent loss problems in the Transmission, Distribution and Generation
Systems. It would cover a three year period. The project would be described
and given a justification and approximate cost estimate. When required, a
Scope of Work or Terms of Reference would be provided to facilitate the
contracting of consulting, engineering or other activities recommended under
the project. This phase would include the following items where appropriate:

-    Design criteria and construction standards.
-    System planning methods and procedures.
--   System operations and maintenance.
-    Service outages and their causes.
-    Voltage control and monitoring procedures.
-    Economic system load control and management methods.
-    Transmission and distribution circuit analysis using computer-based
programs and the data base for this analysis.
-    Transformer specifications and load management.
-    Metering systems, operation, maintenance, testing, installations and
service standards.
-    Meter reading, billing and monitoring procedures.
-    System and circuit power factor measurement and cor-ective measures.
-    System technical loss assessment, value of losses and estimate of
loss reduction potential.
-    Review of non-technical losses and measures to control them.
-    Construction methods, standards, equip'ient and procedures.
Generation
The boilers, turbogenerators and auxiliaries would be examined in
detail to identify areas of losses or where rehabilitation was needed
or where improvements in efficiency could be achieved. The following
items would be included where appropriate:
(a) The scope for taking advantage of advanced technology by
retrofitting more efficient parts in boilers, turbines and
auxiliaries such as turbine blades and seals, boiler burners and
excess air control.
(b) The adequacy and condition of manual and automatic controls.
(c) Maintenance progams, procedures and effectiveness and spare
parts stocks.
(d) Plant operations efficiency.
(e) Fuel quality control.
Traning
-    The needs for training programs will be assessed for Transmission,
Distribution and Generating Systems in as far as this is related to
improving efficiency.
13.      The second phase would be in the form of a Long-term Power System
Betterment and Expansion Program covering a period of about five years after
the Preliminary Project. This would have a general description, an order of
magnitude cost estimate and be defined objectively to specify desired results,
criteria and approach.
Criteria
14.      System long-run marginal cost (LRMC) shall be used for valuing
efficiency-improvement benefits. These costs shall be expressed in terms of



- 61 -
ANNEX 2.8
Page 4 of 4
capacity benefits ($/kW) and energy benefits ($/kW) at each principal voltage
level. Present-value or life-cycle costing shall be used for all analyses
using appropriate opportunity costs (107 for capital unless otherwise
specified). Transmission and distribution facilities shall be studied by
appropriate sanpling techniques using micro-processor computer programs or
equivalent methodologies (programmable calculators).

SONELGAZ
THIRD POWER PROJECT
STUDY ON MIS AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS
TERMS OF REFERENCE
I. Introduction
1.        The "Societe Nationale de 1'Electricite et du Gaz", (SONELGAZ) has
the monopoly of electricity production and distribution and of
transportation of natural gas through secondary pipelines throughout
the country. It is also responsible for marketing various
electrical appliances.
2.        During the last fifteen years, SONELGAZ has experienced an
unprecedented expansion of its activities, as a result of the
strategic role of the energy sector in the country's development.
Furthermore, this growth has been characterized by an average growth
rate of electricity and gas sales during the period of 14% anti 34%,
respectively.
In view of this exceptional development of its activities, which has
resulted at the same to time in an increasing complexity of its
management and operations, SONELGAZ has adopted a highly
decentralized organizational structure : 13 operational units
covering some 110 agencies scattered throughout the country.
3.        If decentralization has enabled to improve managerial efficiency, by
bringing decision-making centers closer to activity sources, it has,
on the other hand, raised another issue which has still not been
resolved to date. Indeed, a discrepancy currently exists between
the enterprise's internal management systems (MIS) and its
accounting framework (methods and procedures) which have not been
developing at the same pace. As a result, the present situation is
characterized by the fact that the current accounting system is
inadequate and clearly fails to meet the various needs of the
enterprise's management and organizational structure.
II. Objectives of the study
1.        The objective of this study is to provide SONELGAZ, on the one hand
with a new, more flexible accounting system, better suited to
internal management requirements and, on the other hand, with an
efficient MIS system, capable of facilitating the enterprise's



- 86 -
ANNEX 4.4
Page 2 of 3
management, improving the efficienicy of decision-makings and the fluidity of
its information flow.
III. Implementation of the study
The study will be implemented in two stages each covering a one year
period.
The first stage will consist of an assessment of the strengths and
weaknesses of the current accounting and MIS systems, with a particular
emphasis on the following points :
(i)       review of accounting and cost accounting systems;
(ii)      assessment of the accounting MIS system in terms of relevance, speed
and accuracy;
(iii)     study of the macro aspects of the enterprises accounting and
financial functions (interface of accounting and financial systems
between the regional centers and the head office) and of its micro
aspects (methods and procedures used by the various units).
(iv)      compatibility of accounting and MIS systems;
(v)       use of computers/micro-computers
The review of the various points mentioned above will be done in parallel to
that cf the following subsystems :
-         monitoring of the cost of investment projects;
-         monitoring of inventories and equipment management
-         loan management systems
-         billing system for customers (energy and works);.
-         management system for customer accounts (aging balance of account
receivables, analysis of customers' balance by sector).
Special emphasis will be granted to the distribution of
administrative tasks and investment expenditures shared by the enterprise's
various activities (mainly electricity and gas). To this effect, the study
wil have to provide specific proposals regarding allocation criteria for these
charges and expenditures.
The second phase of the study will attempt, in light of the results
of previous activities, to formulate the necessary modifications on current
systems or relatirng to the conception and development of new systems,
including the development of the necessary computer modules.
A detailed implementation schedule of recommended actions will also have to be
set up as well as the training and familiarization of the agents concerned to



- 87 -
ANNEX 4.4
Page 3 of 3
approved and reccomended systems. The implementation of approved
recommendations will begin in 1991.
IV. Reports
a.        An appraisal report summarizing the present status of current
systems as well as the implementation plan for measures envisaged in
the short-term to correct the noted weaknesses will be issued at the
end of the first phase.
b.        A second report will be issued at the end of the second phase of the
study, which will present the recommendations and the alternatives
developed for the complete reorganization of the systems as well as
the implementation schedule of the recommended actions.

THIRD POWER PROJECT
Study for the Definition of Optimal (economic, energy and industrial)
Power Generation Options
Draft Terms of Reference
Introduction
1.       SONELGAZ generates electrici-y mainly from steam turbines and
combustion turbines which use natural gas as fuel. Since Algeria's gas
resources are among the largest in the world, it is expected that natural gas
will continue to be the main fuel used by SONELGAZ for a long time to come.
The question arises whether combined-cycle power stations fueled by natural
gas would have a role in SONELGAZ's least-cost power generation investment
program.
Objectives
2.       The objectives of the study are the following:
(i)    to provide information on existing and planned combined-cycle power
stations in other countries;
(ii)    to provide information on: technical characteristics, availability,
lifetime, heat rates, investment and operating costs of new
combined-cycle units and of conversions of existing steam or
combustion turbines to combined-cycle operation, all based on
conditions in Algeria.
(iii)   to determine the optimal combination of steam and combustion turbines
in combined-cycle units under Algerian conditions and the optimal
size of combined-cycle units;
(iv)    to determine the optimal role of combined-cycle generacing units in
SONELGAZ's power generation system; and
(v)    to make a comparative analysis of the possibilities for local
manufacture of equipment for the options of 300 MW combined-cycle
units and 300 MW conventional steam turbine units.
Specific Tasks
The specific tasks of the study are as follows:
(i)    prepare a list of existing and planned combined-cycle generating
units (new and converted plants) elsewhere in the world accompanied
by information on investment and operating costs, heat rates, number
of hours available during the year, lifetime, and other technical and
economic data (such is the diminution of power during summer);



- 89 -
ANNEX 5.1
Page 2 of 2
(ii)    examine options for converting existing steam or combustion turbines
in Algeria to combined-cycle;
(iii)   identify options for new combined-cycle power stations, and determine
the optimal combination of combustion turbines and steam tutbines in
comnbined-cycle units, the optimal size of new units, and suitable
sites.
(iv)    determine the technical and operating characteristics of
combined-cycle units under Algerian conditions;
(v)    make preliminary estimates of local and foreign capital costs;
(vi)    carry out economic analyses to determine the optimal amount and
timing of combined-cycle units, using SONELGAZ's optimal planning
models (e.g. WASP III); these analysis should take account of the
eventual exhaustion of natural gas in Algeria and the possible need
to replace gas power stations by power stations using coal or other
sources of energy;
(vii)   make a comparative analysis of the possibilities for local
manufacture of equipment for the options of 300 MW cGmbined-cycle
units and 300 MW conventional steam turbine units;
(viii)  seek information on the strategies of large world manufacturers of
combustion turbines and steam turbines in the context of rapid
technological advance of combustion turbines. This information will
permit Algeria to prepare its own approach to the domestic
manufacture of these means of generation of electricity;
(ix)    carry out a detailed feasibility study of the option of converting an
existing power station to combined-cycle operation in the event that
the economic analysis undertaken in (ii) above indicates that a
converted unit would enter the least-cost power generation investment
program.
At the start of the study the consultant should arrange a seminar for
interested persons in A.geria on the experience with combined-cycle power
stations in other countties.
The consultant should also arrange visits for selected SONELGAZ
personnel to several combined-cycle power stations abroad.

THIRD POWER PROJECT
RATE OF RETURN ANALYSIS
1.            The economic analysis of the project is set out in the
Attachment of this Annex and was carried out on the basis that the
project forms an integral part of the investment program for SONELGAZ
over the period 1988 - 1994.  The program is estimated to have an
internal economic rate of return of 6.3%. The main assumptions used to
make the analysis are set out here.
2.   Benefits      The benefits include the incremental electricity revenues
for the period 1989 - 1995. The annual benefits were kept constant at
the 1995 level from 1996 through 2020. The year 2020 marks the expected
end of the useful life of steam turbine, transmission and distribution
facilities brought into service during the period 1989 - 1994. The
revenue estimates were made in mid - 1987 prices by multiplying the
deflated tariff rates projected in the financial analysis to be necessary
to ensure an adequate level of self-financing for the power subsector
(Chapter IV) by the projected incremental sales quantities (Annex 2.4)
3.   Costs     The costs include:  incremental fuel costs; incremental
operating and maintenance costs; and investments in generation,
transmission and distribution planned to meet the additional demand
forecast to occur from 1989 through 1995.
4.             Incremental natural gas fuel costs were calculated using the
estimated economic cost of US $..00 per million Btus. Incremental
gas-oil costs were calculated using an international gas-oil price
projected to increase from AD 752 per ton in 1989 to AD 913 per ton in
1995 in 1987 prices. The average heat rate for natural gas generation
was assumed to fall from 3.10 thermies per kWh in 1989 to 2.75 thermies
in 1995 as the proportion of relatively high efficiency generating units
increases.  The heat rate for diesel generation was assumed to remain
constant at 250 grams per kWh.
5             Incremental 0 & M costs were calculated on the basis of 1.5% of
capital assets per year for generation and 1% per year for transmission
and distribution.
6.            The investment expenditures cover units which enter service
between 1988 and 1995 and are used to supply incremental demand between
1989 and 1995. They exclude, however, investments made before 1996 on

generating units which would enter service after 1995.  Adjustments
were made for the projected retirement of 180 M4 of steam turbine
capacity and 113 MW of combustion turbine capacity by subtracting
investment costs corresponding to the same capacities from investments
in new capacity on the assumption that the corresponding part of the
new capacity would be needed to serve existing demands rather than meet
new demands after 1988.  The lCxlOO MW combustion turbine units which
enter service in 1988/89 are assumed to be replaced in 2010. Sinct che
replacement units would continre in service beyond 2020 a benefit was
estimated by calculating the present value in 2020 of the stream of
annuities in the period from 2020 until the end of the useful lives of
the units, where the annuity was chosen so as to yield an internal rate
of return on the original investment equal to 10% The investment
expenditures include all transmission and distribution expenditures
projected to be made from 1989 through 1995.
7.     Sensitivity Tests   The internal rate of return was recalculated
assuming that the average price of electricity is set equal to the
lorg-run marginal cost.  The result is a rate of 132.  A further
calculation was made where benefits were adjusted to include the
consumers' surplus on the incremental sales. The consumers' surplus in
each year was estimated on the assumption of a constant elasticity of
demand equal to - 0.3.  The surplus was assumed to remain constant
after 1995 at the 1995 level. The result is an internal rate of return
of 202.
