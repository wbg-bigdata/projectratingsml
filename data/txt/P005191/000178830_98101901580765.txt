APPRAISAL OF
THE 11DU$TRIAL ASE TITNING DEVELORENT BANK OF IRAN
SUMOAY
i.        The Industrial and Mining Development Bank of Iran (IMDBI was
established in 1959 and since then it has received five bank loans amount-
ing to about $105 million. The most recent loan, of $40 million, was granted
in May 1969.  It has been utilized more quickly than was expected at that
time and IMDBI has now requested a sixth bank loan of $50 million.
ii.       The econcmy of Iran remains buoyant and a measure of diversifica-
tion has been achieved, although the economy remains heavily dependent on
oil. While the GNP rose at an annual growth rate of 8.5%, value added in
industry increased by 11.6% during 1962/63 - 1968/69.
iii.      Although the growth of private industrial investment has been
spectacular, this has to a large extent been confined to the development
of industries supplying the local market, which have been given a high level
of protection against imported goods.   The export of manufactured goods
(other than oil) has remained fairly limited.   The government has now
announced a new industrial policy which places a very high priority on the
need to expand the export capacity of the industrial sector and the level
of protection that will in future be given to import substitution industries
is to be reduced. IMDBI played an important role in creating the climate
for this revision of industrial policy.
iv.       During the six years ended March 20, 1970, IMDBI's annual disburs-
ements constituted about 12% to 13% of private fixed industrial investment.
The most important feature of IMDBI's operations is its promotional work.
By March 20, 1970 IMDBI had promoted twenty-four projects. In most cases
these projects included an investment by private foreign investors and in
nine projects a portion of the share capital was made available to the
general public in Iran.
V.        IMDBI's appraisal of the financial, marketing and management
aspects of projects is satisfactory and using these financial appraisal
techniques IMDBI has built up a sound portfolio. However, the financial
success of its projects does not necessarily indicate in all cases a
satisfactory performance from an economic standpoint. High returns to
investors often reflect excessive protection, concessional interest rates
and low effective rates of taxation. Mqore attention should be given by
INDBI to the economic appraisal of projects, so that it can assist in the
implementation of the government's new industrial policy of reducing the
high level of protection and increasing the volwme of exports. IMDBI has
agreed to adopt a systematic approach to the evaluation of effective rates
of protection for use by it in its appraisal of sub-projects.
Vi.       An analysis of IMDBI's portfolio shows that it has concentrated
its lending and investment activity on the creation of new industries, most



- ii -
of which sell their products in the domestic market. Although IMDBI's
cc(-.nitments are still ma-nly in the provinces of Tehran and Esfahan (including
Yazd), some diversification of its commitments has occurred-Add dui1ing bJe
past two and half years the proportion of IMDBI's conmmitments in Tehran was 5C%
compared to 70% as of June 1967.
vii.       At present IMDBI's loan supervision work is concerned mainly with
the disbursemgent of loans and the recovery of arrears of interest and
principal. These functions are being performed satisfactorily, but IMDBI's
end-use supervision has wider aspects which are of considerable importance
in Iran. These should be given greater attention by IMDBI which could and
should play a pioneering role in assisting its clients to raise productivity
so that the ground is prepared for phasing out excessive protection as well as
for raising taxes and interest rates.
viii.      IMDBI's management is strong, but is too concentrated at the top.
Department Heads do not participate adequately in decision-making and the
professional staff is too small to cope with the volume of business. IMDBI
should devise procedures for reducing the work load of top management,
strengthen its staff at the department head level and do everything possible
to attract promising young university graduates. These measures would
enhance the institutional strength of IMDBI.
ix.        IMDBI's profitability has been good, its portfolio is well
diversified and is generally sound. However, a shortage of Rial resources
is constraining IUDBI's operations and steps to raise additional Rial
resources need to be studied.  Although it is IMDBI's goal to reduce its
dependvence on governmental funds and seek its resources in the market,
consi6 .;able time will be needed to realize this goal.  In order to progress
systema'ically in this direction, IMDBI intends to study both the general
action needed on the part of various agencies to develop a capital market,
and alternative ways in which it can keep savings for itself. Some of these
alternatives have been discussed with IMDBI's management. It has also been
agreed that IMDBI will increase its effective lending rate from 8% to 9% in
line with the recent upward adjustments of other interest charges in Iran.
x.         During the next two years IMDBI will need about $86 million to
meet its estimatbed foreign currency commitments. A loan of DM 50 million
($13 rmillion approximately) is being negotiated with Kf'W and the German
Government and it is recommended that the Bank grant IMBI a loan of $50
millior. which, if approved, would cover the bulk of its foreign exchange
requirements for the next two vears.  The Bank will, in this event, continue
to be the principal source of foreign exchange.  IIDBI is aware of the need
to raise additional resources from other quarters.



APPRAISAL OF
THE ITDUST2ITAL AND MI`.ILT!Q DEVEILOEWT BANK OF IRAN
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Industrial and Mining Developaent Bank of Iran (IMDBI) is more
than ten years old.  It has received five loans from the Bank for a total
ainount of about $105 million and it has requested a sixth loan.  This report
recommends that the Bank should extend another loan of $50 million.
1.02      The focus of the report is on the impact of IMDBI's activities on
the economy of Iran and particularly on the industrial sector. In the first
part of the report, IMDBI's lending criteria and resource mobilization policies
are evaluated in the light of the overall economic situation in Iran. A full
analysis of the economic situation appears in "Economic Situation and Prospects
of Iran" (SA-8a) dated December 31, 1969. The report then makes an assessment
of the institutional and financial aspects of IMDBI. For purposes of this
assessment, no distinction is made between activities in which IM)DBI uses its
own equity or borrowed funds and activities relying on funds it manages on
behalf of government, unless such a distinction is essential to meaning. Oper-
ational and financial details may be found in the preceding Appraisal Report
(DB-47b) dated April 22, 1969 and in the annexes to this Report.  The second
part of the Report concerns the future of IDMBI and how it can adjust its
policies so as to take advantage of important changes that are taking place in
the Iranian economy. In this part the future business prospects of IMDBI are
assessed and the need for a new Bank loan is considered.
II. IMDBI'S ROLE IN THE 1960s
2.01      The economy of Iran has experienced a high rate of growth in income,
investment and exports during the sixties. A measure of diversification has
also been achieved, although the economy remains heavily dependent on oil.
WAhile GNP rose at an annual growth rate of 8.5%, value-added in industry in-
creased 11.6% per year during 1962/1963 - 1968/1969. This expansion reflected
a major upsurge in industrial investment both in the public and private sectors
(see Annex 1).
2.02      Private industrial investment increased from about Rials 5 billion at
the beginning of the Third Plan in October 1962 to more than 20 billion at the
start of the Fourth Plan in March 1968 (see graph 1).  This spectacular in-
crease came about because the overall economy was buoyant and the framework of
government policies provided liberal incentives for industrialization. High
protection, low effective tax rates, the encouragement of foreign private
investors and the channeling of budgetary funds through financial intermediaries
at concessional terms were the main features of industrial policy.
2.03      This was the setting within which IMDBI made its contribution to
Iranian industrialization. The role played by this organization can be
evaluated by reference to (a) the extent to which its promotional work and
project appraisals improved the pattern of industrial investment, (b) the extent

to which its loan supervision activit4es helped industrialists deal with
problems during the construction and initial production stages of their projects,
(c) the extent to which it financed private industrial investment through the
disbursement of its funds, and (d) the extent to which it mobilized resources
for industrial investment from other quarters.
IMDBI as a Source of Industrial Finance
2.o4      IMIDBI's Rial and foreign exchange loans rose very sharply in recent
years (see graph 2). As a result total disbursements quadrupled during the
last six years (1963/64 - 1969/70). They constituted on the average about
12-13% of private fixed industrial investment in recent years. The other major
institution specializing in long-term industrial finance was the government-owned
Industrial Credit Bank (ICB) which lent principally to small and medium enter-
prises.  ICB financed about 8% of total private investment.  The Bank Melli
extends 1 to 3 year loans to industry in addition to advances for working
capital, but available data do not permit an identification of term loans. On
the whole, Iranian private industry relied on long-term institutional finance
for 20-25% of total fixed capital formation and IMNBI played a predominant role
in this field.
2.05      Direct foreign private investment rose very sharply, partly as a
result of IMDBI's initiative in arranging joint ventures and collaboration
deals with foreign groups on favorable terms (see paragraph 2.10). On the
average, thin inflow of equity funds was about 8% of total private fixed
industrial investnent. The magnitude of suppliers' credits from abroad cannot
be ascertained precisely. A sample of projects financed by IMDBI revealed that
suppliers' credits were nearly 10% of outstanding liabilities and they financed
about 20% of fixed assets.
2.06      INMBI is not an important source of finance for working capital.  For
this industrialists have recourse to commercial banks and the unorganized money
market or the "bazaar". Commercial bank credit to industry increased by
Rls 5.5 billion during the 12 months ending September 1969 and the outstanding
sum was Rls 27.6 billion. Bazaar finance has diminished in relative importance
but there is no doubt that it still plays a significant role, particularly
among small-sized industrial firms.
IMDBI as a Mobilizer of Industrial Finance
2.07      The establishment of the Tehran Stock Exchange owes much to the
initiative and influence of IIDBI. However, this exchange is in its infancy
and still contributes little to resource mobilization for the industrial sector.
IMDBI's loan and investment operations are financed very largely through
concessional funds obtained from government and through Bank loans guaranteed
by the government. Very little has been done by the institution to reduce
its heavy dependence on these sources. IMDBI operations in recent years have
been constrained by a shortage of Rial funds.
2.08      IMDBI's equity constitutes nearly 11% of its total resources (in-
cluding managed funds) at present. Paid-in share capital was increased in
1965/66 and then again in 1967/68. Reserves have increased rapidly and now
constitute 21% of total equity. Budgetary and other government agency loans

to IMDBI, carrying an average effective interest rate of about 4%, account for
62% of total resources. The remaining 25% consists of Bank loans. Although
the Bank has been the only source of foreign exchange in the past, IIDBI is
aware that in future it will be necessaxy for it to obtain foreign exchange
from other sources as well. Negotiations for a loan of DM 50 million from KfW
and the German Government are in progress.
2.09      IMDBI took the initiative in establishing the Tehran Stock Exchange
in February 1968. The Deputy Managing Director of IMDBI is the General Sec-
retary of the Exchange. All the rules and regulations have also been formulated
by IMDBI. So far there are only 8 companies listed on the Exchange and the
volume of shares traded is still very small although recently it has increased
sharply.  IMDBI's own shares were the first to be listed and trading in these
shares accounts for more than 90% of the total value of shares traded. The
major gap at present is the absence of any medium or long-term fixed interest
securities. IMDBI realizes that the development of the capital market will be
a slow process.
2.10      Meanwhile the best approach to resource mobilization, according to
ID8I management, is to create industrial projects which will attract personal
or corporate savings directly, rather than through financial intermediaries.
In fact, IMDBI has had a measure of success in attracting private foreign in-
vestors in this way. There are at present 102 foreign companies operating in
Iran. Of these 48 are associated in one way or another with IMDBI. In the
case of 25 projects financed by IMDBI, the latter had made equity or a combi-
nation of equity and loan investments jointly with foreign investors and local
sponsors. In the remaining 23 cases, IMDBI was associated only in the role of
a creditor. During the past five years foreign investors associated with IMDBI
accounted for about a quarter of the total inflow of funds from this source.
2.11      In the case of 9 promoted projects, I4DBI reserved a proportion of
the total paid-in capital for subscription by the general public (i.e. entities
other than local sponsors of the project). In the case of two sugar projects,
the proportion offered for public subscription was rather high (30% and 46%) as
there was considerable local interest among sugar farmers in the project areas.
In other cases this proportion has varied between 10% and 27%. These share
offerings have been successful except for the most recent case of a project
to manufacture compressors for refrigerators. The inadequate response from the
public in this instance is attributed by IMDBI to unfamiliarity with the product
and to conditions created in the money market by recent government policy,
including the issue of government bonds yielding 8-9% interest tax free (see
paragraph 3.02).   Vihatever the nature of the difficulty in this case, there is
no doubt about the desirability of the general IMDBI policy aimed at resource
mobilization as well as widening the ownership of industrial shares.
2.12      Yet another feature of IMDBI policy is to raise resources by selling
shares from its equity portfolio. During the four years ending March 1970,
these sales have amounted to Rls 137 million. IMDBI's equity portfolio as of
March 20, 1970, amounted to Rls 959 million. As IMDBI investments mature and
projects establish a profit record, these sales should gather momentum.
2.13      Finally, an important point made by IMDBI management is that its
catalytic role has increased, as the proportion of total project cost financed



- 4 -
by it has diminished from an average of 38% in the early sixties to 27% in
recent years. Correspondingly savings, from sources other than INDBI, tapped
for industrial investment have increased much more rapidly than IMDBI operations.
However, the evidence is not altogether clear on this point. Also it is
difficult to establish whether or not the increase in IMDBI's catalytic effect
is the result of deliberate policy. The overall average proportion of the total
cost of projects financed by IMDBI hides a very wide range. For example in
1968/69, the proportion was less than 20%o in six cases and more than 6Cf in 17
other projects.
TDIBI's Promotional Work and Project Appraisals
2.14      As a specialized institution for long-term investment, IMDBI places
emphasis on appraising project applications. A distinctive aspect of this
development finance company is the initiative and resourcefulness it has
displayed in identifying investment opportunities and in "promoting" projects.
These activities have helped improve the quality of resource allocation in the
industrial sector. There is no doubt that in the standards it applies to
project analysis, IMDBI is pre-eminent among institutions in Iran. However,
the room for improvement remains large and IMDBI is aware of the need to in-
crease its capability, particularly in the economic aspects of project evaluation.
2.15      The engineering work of IDDBI is of reasonable quality, considering
the acute shortage of experienced professionals prevailing in Iran. Project
ideas which are defective from a technical standpoint are either weeded out or
modified with the assistance of IMDBI experts or hired consultants.  A weakness
in engineerirg appra sal which has recently surfaced, is the high incidence of
cost-ovei-runs owing mainly to the mechanical application of unit construction
cost coefficients. Steps are being taken to improve estimation procedures.
2.16      The financial, marketing and management aspects of investment
proposals are ,.Balyzed satisfactorily and I]$DBI staff works closely with
project sponsors to prepare financial plans which have a reasor?:FDle chance of
success.  A rate of return on equity (after tax) of at least l5p0 is used as
a guideline in approving projects. Price forecasts take account of the demand
and suu!i-y situation prevailing in the domestic market as well as present or
intended measures of protection against import competition. As far as liquidity
aspects are concerned, the IIMBI attitude is flexible. The security for a
loan is usually a mortgage over all the fixed assets that are available and
the exchange risk is passed on to the borrower.
2.17      Using these financial appraisal techniques, INDBI has built up a
sound portfolio.  It is believed that as a rule fDBI clients are earning
high rates of return on equity. Although this assertion cannot be substantiated
by systematic data, there exists scattered evidence to fortify it. The
incidence of financial delinquency among LDBI clients is low (see paragraph
2.39 for details).
2.18      High returns on equity after tax, do not necessarily indicate
satisfactory performance from an econonic standpoint under conditions now
existing in Iran. Such returns may reflect excessive protection, concessional



interest rates and low effective rates of taxation. For this reason it is
important to look at IMDBI's portfolio from a broader economic point of view.
WJhile adequate systematic data are lacking concerning employment, output, local
and comparable c.i.f. prices, capacity utilization, value added, export sales
or imported inputs of projects now in production, it is possible to derive a
few conclusions about the developmental quality of IMDBI's portfolio and how
it compares with the overall industrial pattern in Iran.
2.19      First, IIMfBI has concentrated its lending and investment activity
in creating new industries. Metal products, non-metallic minerals, transport
equipment, electrical and other machinery, rubber and wood products account
for 60% of fMDBI commitments compared to a share of only 25% in the aggregate
capital stock of the Iranian manufacturing sector (see Anunex 2). The new
industries of Iran are dominated by projects conceived, formulated and financed
by IMDBI. By contrast, the traditional industries - food, beverages, tobacco,
textiles - account for 28% of IMDBI commitments and 64% of the aggregate capital
stock of the manufacturing sector.
2.20      Secondly, IMDBI projects are not export-oriented.  The preponderance
of sales by IMDBI clients are in the domestic market. No doubt these manu-
facturing concerns have secured a fair measure of import substitution. However,
this has been achieved at high cost, as local prices are much above comparable
international prices.  Also, these new industries are heavily dependent on
imported inputs. In these respects, IMDBI operations reflect the general
characteristics of Iranian industrialization during the 1960s.
2.21      Thirdly, it is possible to analyze the IMDBI portfolio according to
the degree of tariff and other protection enjoyed by its clients, based on
statistics assembled by the Bank Industrialization Mission (see Annex 3).
About one third of IMDBI commitments are to companies which manufacture
articles on a fairly competitive basis. This includes cement, tires, pharma-
ceuticals, footwear and packaged meat; in these cases local prices are about
equal to c.i.f. prices. In other instances, domestic prices are somewhat
higher than comparable international prices but the margin does not exceed
30%O in any case.
2.22      Another third of IMDBI commitments are to companies producing
articles which enjoy high rates of protection. In several instances - sugar,
refrigerators, television sets, automobiles and glass - the price differential
is 100% or more.  These price margins are an approximate measure of rates of
nominal protection, brought about by a combination of tariff duties, prohi-
bitions and quotas. High local prices also reflect the impact of indirect
taxes in certain cases. Nevertheless, even after allowance is made for fiscal
levies, it is more than likely that rates of effective protection are higher
tlhan nominal rates.  This is because imported inputs generally bear tariff
duties lower than those on finished goods and because the share of valua
added in prices is fairly low.
2.23      Fourthly, IMDBI's commitments were heavily concentrated in the
provinces of Tehran and Esfahan (including Yazd). These accounted for 27% of
Iran's total population and 83% of IMDBI's commitments as of June 1967 (see
Annex 4). As congestion became a critical problem in the Tehran area, the



- 6 -
Government initiated a policy of geographical decentralization, prohibiting
the establishment of new industrial projects.  In the subsequent two and a
half years, the proportion of IMDBI's commitments in the Tehran area was about
50%, compared to 70% on a cumulative basis up to June 1967. Loans were still
extended for expanding capacity of existing concerns and for 13 new projects
for which the Ministry of Economy had issued licenses before the announcement
of the new policy. There was also a reduction in the share of IMDBI commitments
in Esfahan (including Yazd), a province which is relatively developed in terms
of the degree of industrialization. On the other hand, the relatively backward
provinces of Eastern Azarbayejan, Kuzestan and Lorestan, Kermanshahan and
Kerman recelved an increased share of IMDBI commitments.
2.24      To recapitulate, INDBI-financed projects, particularly those which
were conceived and promoted by it, have injected an element of dynamism in
Iran's industrial structure. Through them new technology is being assimilated,
new products are being produced and new regions are being industrialized.
However, the social cost of this activity is sometimes fairly high and instances
of misallocation are not uncommon. The responsibility for this fact rests
both on the present framework of government industrial policy and on the
inadequacy of economic appraisal techniques used by IMDBI.
2.25      The present practice of IMDBI in analyzing the economic characteristics
of proposed projects seems adequate at first glance. The capital-output ratio,
the coefficient of capital per worker, the import component of production costs
and an estimate of foreign exchange savings are calculated. However, the
utility of most of these measures is greatly reduced by the failure to adjust
for the impact of protective devices on the Iranian cost-price structure.
Furthermore, 2IIDBI has not been able so far to establish guidelines or norms
based on either international data or information drawn from the historical
experience of Iran. In this situation it is difficult to appreciate what role
is played by the calculation of these coefficients in the decision-making
process of II4DBI.
INDBI's Loan Supervision Activity
2.26      The main emphasis of the Loan Supervision Department's work at
present is on monitoring disbursements and on helping borrowers in acute
financial difficulty. These functions are of critical importance to insti-
tutions such as IN4DBI, which must protect their capital and ensure regular
servicing of their loans. However, end-use supervision also has wider aspects
which are of considerable importance in the context of present-day Iran and
to which IMDBI has not yet turned its attention.
2.27      That existing functions are being performed satisfactorily is clear
from the record. No bankruptcies have taken place and the problem of arrears
of debt service is under control (see paragraph 2.39). However, there is room
for improvement. No reporting requirements are prescribed apart from a request
for annual accounts, which are received irregularly. In the case of projects
in serious difficulties, IMDBI becomes involved in the actual management of the
company. This may take the form of IMDBI taking over the check-drawing
authority, frequent factory visits on the basis of which operating decisions
are taken by IMDBI, or the extreme measure of seconding an IMDBI officer



to take over the funct-on of the Maraging Director of the company concerned on
a res Q-t &nd Lul'.-lbiiiL' DaSis.  II{TI proposes to enlarge this function by
establishing a Management Serv:Lces Unit as soon as possible.  It has recently
entered into an agreement with PA Management Consultants to have one of its
staff seconded to IMDBI for a period of two years.  The man from PA Management
Consultants and another II4DBI officer currently in training with Arthur D. Little
Co., will hclp start the Unit. A concerted attempt should be made to recruit
quickly and build up the Unit to its full strength.
2.28      At present IMDBI does little more than take care of crisis situations.
It is not equipped to anticipate difficulties and to take steps to prevent
them.  Such contingency planning requires that IMDBI be fully informed about
all its clients and not only those who are currently experiencing financial
distress. An organized approach to the collection and analysis of operational
data at the project level can also provide a valuable basis for bringing about
improvements in appraisal techniques - engineering, financial and economic.
Estimates and projections can be compared with actuals in order to learn from
previous mistakes; this is not being done at present.
2.29      Finally, there is a broader conception of end-use supervision which
IMDBI needs to consider. The financial success of many IMDBI projects rests,
to an important extent, on the prevailing tariff, tax and interest rate
structure. Clients of IMDBI, as well as other industrialists, are receiving
large subsidies from the rest of the Iranian economy in the hope that as
industries acquire operational experience they will learn to stand on their
own feet. In many instances, IMDBI was instrumental in obtaining such
subsidies for its clients through its intercession on their behalf with
Government. IMDBI whould now use its considerable influence with private
industrialists to prepare the ground for phasing out excessive protection and
raising tax and interest rates. The collection and analysis of operational
data will allow IMDBI and its clients to identify the factors responsible for
high costs and guide plant managers to take measures -- labour training,
rationalization of inventory or material use, utilization of by-products,
market adaptation, refinancing capital, mergers -- to improve productivity. If
the government introduces the reforms in industrial policy mentioned above without
the necessary preparatory work at the plant level, seemingly successful IMDBI
projects may run into serious financial problems.
Institutional Strength and Creditworthiness of IMDBI
2.30      Suggestions offered above about the future evolution of IMDBI's
policies and procedures, do not cast doubt on its institutional strength and
creditworthiness. IMDBI enjoys the confidence of both the Government and the
private sector.  An additional Bank loan is justified subject to agreement
being reached on the recommendations made in this report.
2.31      IMDBI's management is strong but is too concentrated at the top.
Mr. A. Gasem Kheradjou became Managing Director in December 1963 and with the
assistance of Mr. Reza Amin, who was his Deputy until 1968, he has developed
a highly functional and centralized organization. Mr. Kheradjou is a capable
and dynamic leader with a strong sense of mission, who has guided the IMDBI
Board of Directors firmly and commands the support of the staff. IMDBI's



- 8 -
Deputy Managing Director is Mr. Fereydoun Mahdavi who joined IMDBI as an
economist and rose from the ranks of the organization.
2.32      Responsibility for decision-making, except for routine matters, rests
mainly on Mr. Kheradjou and Mr. Mahdavi. Consequently, the style of adminis-
tration is highly personal and there is insufficient decentralization. Departimst
Heads do not participate adequately in decision making. The wide gap between the
management and the staff may cause complications if either Mr. Kheradjou or
Mr. 'Uahdavi 'Leaves the institution.
2.33      Considering the workload handled by IMDBI, its professional staff of
43 is small. Total outlay on salaries and wages has not risen much since the
early sixties, despite a very rapid expansion in the volume of business. Admin-
istrative expenses are less than 1% of total assets. IMDBI management is
anxious to recruit additional staff but is constrained by the shortage of
well-qualified professionals in Iran. The turnover of professional staff is
15, per annum and a significant proportion of the present staff has been with
the institution for only a short period. Three Department Heads left IMDBI
during the past seven months.  The reason for this high turnover is that IMDBI
is regarded as a source of qualified and competent men for both government and
industry.
2.34      To summarize, IMDBI should devise procedures for reducing the
workload on top management, strengthen the layer of staff at the Department
head level and do everything possible to attract promising young university
graduates. These measures will enhance the institutional strength of IMDBI.
2.35      I4DBI has considerable influence in government circles, which goes
beyond its membership of various government committees (for example, the
Currency and Banking Committee). This is principally because of the stature
of its management and the evident role of I1DBI in the Iranian economy. LDBI
will not consider a request for financial assistance for a project unless the
sponsor has been granted a license by the Ministry of Econouy. However, there
is a constant exchange of information between this Ministry and IMDBI and in
many cases the latter has influenced a decision on whether a license is to be
issued. In addition, when there are a number of potential sponsors of a
project, IMDBI is usually asked to advise the Ministry on the one to whom it
thinks a license should be granted, or to take on the license itself.
2.36      The relationship between IMDBI and private industrialists is also
good, particularly in the modern industrial sector where the assistance given
by IMDBI is well-known and appreciated. IMDBI is always represented on the
boards of the companies promoted by it and this keeps it in close touch with
what industrialists are thinking and doing.
2.37      IMDBI's profitability has been good.  Despite increases in its share
capital, the return on equity has been satisfactory. In the year just completed,
March 20, 1970, IMDBI is estimated to have earned 14.0% on its equity (after
tax and provisions). The dividend for the year ended on that date will be
increased to 12% from 10% in the previous years. Profitability has been good
principally for two reasons: (i) low cost loans from the Government, the



- 9 -
proportion of which in total disbursements was high until recently, and (ii)
management's determination to keep the adnLinistrative expenses at a low level.
The influence of both these factors is expected to decline in the future.
IWith a smaller proportion of domestic currency loans and with Bank funds
(which carry relatively high cost) accounting for a larger proportion in total
disbursements, the spread between average cost of funds and IMDBI lending rate
has already started to shrink. In 1967/68 the margin was 4.8% declining to
2.8% in 1968/69, and to 2.5% in 1969/70. Administrative expenses are also
expected to increase. IMDBI's accounts for the years ended March 20, 1965
through 1970 are given in Annex 5.
2.38        As a result of sharp increases in lending activity (excluding
Managed Funds), IMDBI's total assets increased by 66% during the last two
years and the trend is expected to continue. The share capital increase in
1968 and the retention of earnings have increased IMDBI's total equity to
Rls. 1,219 million as of March 20, 1970, up 40% during the last two years.
Long-term debt amounted to Rlls. 5,196 million as of March 20, 1970, the long-
term debt to equity ratio being 4.3. The long-term debt/equity ratio, as
defined in the Bank Loan Agreement, was 3.7 as of the same date (maximum
permitted 4.5). A noteworthy feature of Il4DBI's financial condition is its
apparently tight short-term liquidity position. Because of the shortage of
new Rial funds relative to the demand for loans in domestic currency, IMDBI's
current liquidity position has been squeezed. As of March 20, 1970 it has only
Rls. 126 million or 1.5% of its total assets in liquid assets (cash, short-
term deposits and investments). However, IMDBI uses Managed Fund balances to
meet its cash requirements and also has a standing overdraft facility with the
Central Bank. The tight liquidity position is therefore not serious.
2.39        IMDBI's portfolio is sound.  Out of the 315 loans now being serviced,
72 projects are still under construction. Of the remainder, there are no
repayment difficulties in respect of 202 loans. Of the 41 loans which are
in default, 32 have overdues of six months or longer.   The amount involved
is Rls 64.3 million for interest and Rls 209.1 million for principal.  The
total principal amount outstanding in respect of these projects in default
is Rls 568.8 million, or about 8.6% of total loan portfolio outstanding as
of March 20, 1970.  The management of two companies (which have received
six loans) has been taken over by IMDBI;  the principal amount outstanding in   -F
respect of these loans is Rls 138 million. The operations of these two com-
panies are improving.
2.40        IPIDBI's equity portfolio is still unseasoned (see Annex 8).
Of the projects in which it has made equity investments, 18 are under con-
struction or have been in operation for less than 1 year and 10 have been in
operation for less than 2 years. Only 8 companies have an operational record
of more than 2 years.   In all there are 8 companies which have paid a divi-
dend; the rates have varied from a minimum of 4% to a maximum of 50%, the
most common being 10%. IMDBI's total equity portfolio as of December 20, 1969
was Rls 1,428 million.



-10-
2.41        As of December 20, 1969 lBDBI had a provision for doubtful loans
and equity investments amounting to Ris 233 million or 3.1% of its total
portfolio.  In addition it had reserves amounting to Rls 259 million or 3.4%
of its tO&]b4_tW1i o. A number of projects are at present in default because
they have expanded their capacity and are temporqrily short of working capital.
IMDBI considers that only a few projects are in serious condition. In these
circumstances, the provision made for doubtful loans and equity investments
appears to be adequate.   There has been no write-off of any loan or equity
investment so far and nine is anticipated. The book value of the portfolio
does not overstate its real worth.
III.   IMDBI's PROSPECTS
3.01        Rapid growth in Iran has created acute financial pressures and
the economy is experiencing severe budgetary and balance of payment strains
at present.   Total investment in both the public and private sectors has
risen much faster than savings. Foreign exchange reserves have declined
sharply and there has taken place a large increase in short-term external
debt.   Provided suitable policy measures are taken to deal with these prob-
lems, the long-term growth outlook for Iran remains favorable.
3.02        Efforts are underway, for example, to increase private savings,
to expand exports of manufactured goods and to improve the quality of the
investment program. These adjustments at the governmental level will require
a reconsideration of certain IMDBI policies and procedures.   It should make
greater efforts than in the past to strengthen the capital market in order to
reduce its dependence on budgetary funds. In addition IMDBI should raise its
lending rate so that it can better afford to mobilise resources in the private
market. Furthermore, IMDBI's lending policy should focus on the need to build
export oriented industrial capacity and to improve the economic aspects of
project appraisal.
IMDBI's Business Forecast
3.03        Projections made by I'DBI indicate that, on an approval basis,
loans and equity operations will expand from an average level of Rls 3,719
million during the last three years to an average of Rls 6,333 million during
the remaining three years of the Fourth Plan (see Annexes 10-14).   The im-
plied annual rate of growth of operations is 18% compared to 25% experienced
in the preceding period. Some slowing down in the pace of expansion is not
an unreasonable assumption to make in the context of the strained balance of
payments position of the economy. Projections for the subsequent two years
(1973/74 and 1974/75) are too low;   IMDBI found it difficult to prepare
plausible estimates for these years in the absence of an overall framework
for the Fifth Plan.
3.04        Two features of IMDBI projections for the period 1970/71 to 1972/73
deserve comment. First, the underlying assumption is a reduction in the
proportion of Rial loans to total loans; this proportion is expected to de-
cline from 49% in the base period to 37%. An important reason for the change



- 11 -
is tkoeconstraint on the availability of Rial resources. IMDBI has already
started turning down applicants whose needs are for Rial funds only, and this
situation is likely to persist in the immediate period ahead.
3.05        The second aspect of the projections which is of concern is the
fact that IMDBI does not expect any expansion in its equity investments.  On
an approval basis) these increased from Rls 461 million per year during 1965/66-
1967/68 to Rls 542 million during 1967/68 - 1969/70.   The corresponding pro-
jected amount is only Rls 500 million.   The projected levelling off of equity
operations is yet another reflection of the shortage of Rial resources.
Measures must be taken to alleviate this situation, but immediate results are
not foreseen.
3.o6        Forecasting armual changes in the volume of IMDBI business is an
even more difficult exercise than the three-year projections discussed above.
The difficulty arises on account of uncertainties attending the finalization
of promoted projects which involve a complicated sequence of negotiations with
many parties in Iran and abroad. In December 1968 the forecast of approvals
for 1969/70 was Rls 4 billion.   By March 1969, this estimate had been revised
to Rls 9 billion. In the event, approvals amounted to only Rls 5.5 billion
indicating a high degree of slippage.   This explains the bunching of projects,
involving large foreign exchange loans that are expected to be approved in
1970/71.   Approvals of foreign exchange loans are projected to rise by nearly
50% and amount to Rls 4,000 million in that year. As before, some of these
loans may slip into 1971/72, but the forecast of Rls 7 billion ($93 million)
on an approval basis or Rls 6.5 billion ($86 million) on a commitment basis
for the two years together (1970/71 and 1971/72) is reasonable. The pipeline
of projects and the stage of processing already reached fully supports this
view.
3.07        NDMBI's commitments for foreign currency loans in 1971 and 1972
are expected to amount to $86 million. To finance these commitments IMDBI will
have available at the end of 1970 an uncommitted balance out of the fifth
Bank loan estimated at $10 million and as mentioned already it is negotiating
a loan from KfZ"i and the Geiman Government of $13 million equivalent.  Assuming
that that loan will be available, IMDBI will have a resource gap of $63 million
in 1971 - 1972.   However, it is recommended that the size of the next Bank
loan should be $50 million.  INDBI will therefore have the incentive to mobil-
ize additional funds from sources other than the Bank. If this should prove
impossible, IMDBI may have to seek another Bank loan before the end of two years.
The Need for Additional Rial Funds
3.08        Financial institutions making medium and long-term loans to industry
are heavily dependent on budgetary funds which are scarce and are likely to be-
come even more so. Already in 1968/69 the Plan Organization failed to disburse
the amount it had undertaken to provide IMDBI. As an interim measure, the
Central Bank extended this amount on the guarantee of the Plan Organization.
According to current agreements, IIDBI is to receive Rls 1,750 million from
the Plan Organization in addition to Rls 3,222 million of Managed Funds for loans



- 12 -
and equity investments during the Fourth Plan period. Assurances have been
given that the agreed level of support would continue to be made available
despite acute pressures on the development budget. This is in line with the
new industrial policy, announced by the Minister of Economy in March 1970
(3.15 to 3.19 and Annex 15) which indicated a substantially bigger role for
the private industrial sector at the expense of direct industrial investment
in the public sector.
3.09      IDDBI realises that, even assuming that the agreed level of govern-
ment support will be forthcoming, it needs to mobilize additional rials from
private sources both in order to accommodate the likely demand for local
currency financing during the next few years and to increase progressi-Tby
its viability as an autonomous financial institution, which should no longer
need concessional government finance.   To move towards this ultimate goal
a major effort to develop the capital market in Iran, is necessary, which will
require action by IMDBI, other financial institutions and government author-
ities.
3.10      Partly in response to current difficulties, monetary authorities
in Iran have raised short-term interest rates. The Central Bank's discount
rate has risen from 5% in October 1968 to 8% in August 1969.   Interest rates
payable on fixed deposits with commercial banks have also risen sharply and
now stand at 8% tax free. The prime lending rate of commercial banks is 12%,
with effective rates ranging up to 17% after allowing for the impact of
various service charges.   The government has issued one and two year bonds
carrying an interest rate of 8k'% - 9% tax exempt.  Despite these develop-
ments in the money market, no parallel increase in long-term interest rates
has taken place. This is an anomalous situation. Incentives for holding
savings in short-term assets are much stronger than for long-term assets,
at a time when demand for long term funds is far in excess of supply.
3.11      The present interest rate policy of financial institutions dealing
in long-term funds does not permit them to attract from the private market.
IDBI's lending rate has remained at 7% p.a. plus a 1% service charge since
1963.   The ICB lends at '71  p.a.   There is a good case for raising these
rates so that they can begin to tap private savings for the financing of
long-term industrial investment. To compete effectively with commercial bank
deposits and government bonds, INDBI would have to offer private savers a
return of at least 9-10% after taxes. This implies a substantial increase
in IMDBI's lending rate, if it is to maintain an adequate spread on its
financial operations.
3.12      A large increase in INDBI's lending rate all at once is likely to
depress the demand for loans and might adversely affect the rate of industrial
investment.   This should be avoided.  On the other hand, an initial increase
of one to two percentage points can be accommodated, without serious side-
effects, considering the level of profit rates in the industrial sector.
Such a move would have the merit of signalling a redirection of policy.
Industrialists would be put on notice that the cost of capital was increasing
and a climate would be created for taking measures to raise productivity at



- 13 -
the plant level.   Accordingl:; during negotiations it iuas agreed that IMDBI's
lending rate should be increased by onie percentage point as soon as possible.
3.13     A first stcp towards raising resources from the market is a study
of the various alternative courses of action that are possible in the short
run and the measures needed to be taken over the long term. IMDBI intends
to undertake such a study and has begun to look for competent staff to organ-
ize it. In regard to the longer term, the study could usefully indicate areas
in which concerted action by several agencies is needed (for example in the
field of accounting reform, tax incentives, corporate law, monetary instru-
ments). IMDBI's good relationships with various government agencies, its
deep interest in the subject of capital market development, its specialized
knowledge of the field of industrial finance and the reputation it has built
up as a pioneer in many fields, place it in a good position to initiate the
studie s.
3.14      While the above studies and action to implement their findings are
in progress, the prospects for raising Rial resources for INIDBI would also be
reviewed.   Several possibilities were discussed with IMDBI.  The choice of
alternatives will have to wait until IMDBI has conducted a review of possi-
bilities.  However, some that could be considered are (a) accepting deposits
(b) using negotiable bonds and (c) borrowing from commercial banks.   All of
these would help mobilize private savings directly or indirectly for industrial
investment. The features of deposits and bonds would have to be tailored to
the preferences of potential savers and they would have to be on terms com-
petitive with the alternative investment opportunities that are available.
It is recognized that the development of such sources of funds will take time
and that, in the meanwhile, Rial operations will decline in proportion to for-
eign exchange operations, though not declining in absolute terms.   IMDBI's
projections show that it would seek to fill this gap by an increase in current
liabilities (commercial bank overdrafts), but such a course could lead to ser-
ious liquidity problems.
New Industrial Policy and IMDBI's Role
3.15      The manufacturing sector in Iran is a very large net consumer of
foreign exchange. Imports of industrial inputs and capital goods have in-
creased at a phenomenal rate and now constitute nearly two-thirds of total
imports. On the other hand, exports of manufactured goods (other than oil)
remain fairly limited. This is the background for the recent re-examination
of industrial strategy initiated by T1DBI and facilitated by Bank technical
assistance. The new statement of policy places very high priority on the need
to expand the export capacity of the industrial sector. The 1970s have been
christened "The Export Decade".  The policy package includes tax exemptions,
preferential credit facilities and cash subsidies up to maximum of 25% of f.o.b.
value of exports. A sumaary of the statement is given in Annex 15.
3.16      IMDBI can play a role in export promotion.  A number of areas in
which IMDBI can be helpful were identified. In future, INDBI intends, in
suitable instances, to insist that the capacity of a project supported by it



- 14 -
is sufficient to permit the export of a portion of its output, whilst in the
selection of foreign collaborators preference will be given to those who show
an interest in exports and who have the necessary marketing knowledge and
organization. In addition IMDBI will assist the Export Promotion Center,
which has a former IMDBI Department Head as its President, to select firms
with an export potential and help determine the cash subsidy that they would
require to enable them to be competitive in the world market. IMDBI's
effectiveness in this sphere will depend on the speed with which it can col-
lect and analyze a regular flow of information bearing on the operational3
aspects of its clients.
3.17      The new industrial policy also envisages a high rate of import
substitution in the field of intermediate and capital goods.   It is re-
cognized that future import substitution should take place without resort
to excessive protection. Although the policy statement does not lay down
a specific guideline the Ministry of Economy has indicated that a ceiling
on effective protection of 35-4C%/- is visualized in granting licenses.
This ceiling does not affect projects included in IMDBI's pipeline for which
licenses were obtained many months ago.
3.18      IMDBI will have to work out procedures for implementing these policy
directions at the operational project level. A beginning has already been
made. For example, INDBI reccgnizes that not much room is left for further
investment in the consumer goods field. A large number of consumer goods
and certain other industries are not eligible for financing by IMDBI at the
present time. This prohibition applies, for instance, to refrigerators,
television sets and passenger cars. Secondly, IDDBI will not support the
fragmentation of production of a particular product among several firms,, if
this means the establishment of plants of sub-optimum size.   The application
of this principle will prevent the situation which developed when, for example,
IMDBI financed five companies assembling passenger cars in uneconomic-sized
plants.
3.19      Criteria such as the above should help improve the economic rate of
return of INDBI projects. IMDBI intends to adopt a systematic approach to the
evaluation of effective rates of protection required by new projects. The
details of such a procedure will help IMDBI in its decision-making and it will
also enable the Bank to appreciate the economic character of sub-projects
submitted to it for financing. Once experience has been gained and a profile
of protection enjoyed by new projects becomes known, it will be possible to
discuss the question of appropriate ceiling rates of effective protection.
Future Profitability and Debt-Equity Position
3.20      INDBI's profitability will continue to be reasonably satisfactory
in the future as shown in Annex 13.  Despite a half percent increase in the
interest rate of Plan Organization loans to IMDBI, profits in 1971 are ex-
pected to be at the same level, Rls 166 million, as in 1970 and to rise to
Rls 215 million in 1972 and Rls 249 in 1973, which gives INDBI a return of
13.3%, 14.5% and 14.5% on its average equity during these three years.



- 15 -
3.21      Only three installments of the subordinated Government Advance of
Rls 600 million fall due after the last maturity of existing Bank loans.
If the proposed loan is approved, the Government Advance will be repayable
in full before the last maturity of a sixth Bank loan. The debt limitation
for IMDBI should therefore be defined in terms of a single ratio of total
long-term  debt.   This ratio was 3.7 as of March 20, 1970, and is expected
to increase to 7.1 by March 20, 1973.   IMDBI proposes to increase its share
capital by Rls 360 million in 1972 to Rls 1,320 million.   This has been
taken into account in estimating the ratio given above.  In view of IMDBI's
sound portfolio and efficient management it would be appropriate to increase
its limit on long-term debt to seven times its equity and this is recommended.
This would permit IMDBI to continue to expand its operations and borrow as
necessary during the next two years.
3.22      Debt service coverage will be satisfactory.  During the period of
the projections, collections on loans will cover debt repayments 1.25 times,
whilst IMDBI's profit after tax but before financial expenses is approxi-
mately 1.3 times the interest payable.   Assuming the present pattern of
operations, the position is likely to remain satisfactory during the period
of the proposed loan.
IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECQMEWDATIONS
Conclusions
4.01      In addition to being a well-managed and financially strong develop-
ment finance company, IMDBI operates in a buoyant economy in which the
government provides many incentives for industrial development in the private
sector.   IMDBI plays an influential role in this sector and its influence
is particularly strong in the development of new industries. Frequently,
this is the result of the promotional work it has undertaken in conjunction
with foreign investors.
4.02      Although the financial, marketing and management aspects of the
projects supported by INDBI are analyzed satisfactorily, IMDBI should give
more emphasis to the economic aspects of its appraisal work. In particular,
IMDBI should assemble and analyze data necessary to determine effective rates
of protection for the projects that it finances. In addition, IMDBI should
systematize reporting on the operational results of all its projects, rather
than concentrate on those that are in default with their payments to INDBI.
This information would enable IMDBI to anticipate problems, to improve apprais-
al techniques and to assist clients to raise productivity so that the high
level of protection which shelters a large number of industries can gradually
be reduced.  Such information would also help IMDBI to identify clients with
export potential and to monitor their progress.
4.03      IMDBI's management is strong, but more responsibility should be
delegated to department heads. The number of professional staff should
also be increased.



- 16 -
4.04      IMDBI's profitability is good and its portfolio is sound from a
financial standpoint. A shortage of Rial resources is now constraining
IMDBI's operations and it should take steps to remedy this situation.   Al-
though there has been a recent increase in short-term interest rates there
has been no corresponding increase in long-term interest rates.   IMDBI's
effective lending rate has been 8% per annum since 1963 and there should now
be an increase of one or two percentage points.  This will in due course
permit IMDBI to raise resources from the prviate market in the form of
long-term deposits, portfolio sales and in other ways.
4.05      To obtain additional foreign currency resources, IIDBI is negoti-
ating a loan of DM 50 million from KfW and the German government.  However,
the Bank has to date been the sole source of IMDBI's foreign exchange
resources and it is necessary that IMDBI should increase its efforts to find
other sources of foreign exchange. As of March 20, 1970 Bank funds constit-
uted 48% of IMDBI's own long-term resources (excluding Managed Funds) on a
disbursement basis and this proportion will increase if a new Bank loan of
$50 million is approved.   A loan of that size would still leave pressure
on IMDBI to seek additional resources elsewlhere if it is to realize its
investment plan over the next two years.
Recommendations
14.06     IDBI continues to be a suitable recipient for Bank loans and it
is recommended that the Bank should grant IMDBI a sixth loan of $50 million
to be used for imported goods and services.
14.07     The terms of the loan should be those normally applied to lending
to development finance companies, including the standard commitment charge
and a flexible amortization schedule. IMDBI's free limit should remain at
$1 million with an aggregate of one-third of the loan for projects below
the free limit.  The limit on INDBI's long-term  debt should be increased to
seven times its equity.

ANNEX 10
INDUSTRIAL AND MINING DEVELOPMENT BANK OF IRAN
Major Assumptions Underlying Financial Projections
Rate of Commitments
1.   Sixty-five percent of the loans approved in any year are assumed to be
committed in the same year, the remaining 35% being committed in the
following year. In the case of equity investments, 60% are committed in
the year of approval and the balance of 4O% in the following year.
Rate of Disbursements
2.   Of the Rial loans committed in any year, 75% are disbursed in the same
year and 25% in the following year. In the case of Foreign Currency
Loans 60% are disbursed in the same year, 20% in the following year and
20% in the year thereafter. Of the equity investments committed in any
year, 75% are disbursed in the same year and 25% in the following year.
Repayments
3.   The average duration of a loan has been assumed to be seven years, with a
two-year grace period. The estimate of equity sales is based on the past
experience.
Rate of Interest Received
4.   Interest and Service Charges on all loans have been computed at 8% per
annum up to the end of fiscal 1972, and as from fiscal 1973 at 8-1/2%
per annum. A commitment charge of 1% per annum has been assumed on the
unutilized balances of all the loans.
Rate of Interest Paid
5.   Interest on all foreign currency loans has been computed at actual rates
applicable to each, from 5-3/4 to 6-1/2% per annum. However, regarding
the future loans the rate has been computed at 7Z per annum. Interest
on Plan Organization loans has been computed at 3-1/2% per annum.
Administrative Expenses
6.   Salaries and other operating expenses are based on increases of about
10% per annum.
Appropriations
7.   Fifteen percent of the profit after tax has been transferred to Legal
Reserve; the balance remaining, after a 12% appropriation for dividend
has been transferred to General Reserve.

ANNEX 15
pd-_ 1
I Si-ama,- of the Stateirznt of Ne.w
ln"u^tpi   al-d 11.2ort PoLLoies --n Lrar
1.        On March 2, 1970, the Iranian Minister of Economy made a statement
on industrial export policies to take effect on March 21, 1970. The main
points in this policy statement are described in the following paragraphs.
2.        The private sector is to play a major role in industrial developmint.
No projects which are wholly owned by the Government will be started until
the end of the Fourth Plan. Existing industrial firms in the public sector
will be allowed to expand only in their present field of operation. Major
expansion in such key industries as petro chemicals, iron and steel, and
machine tools will take place in the private sector.
3.        New industrial investment will be concentrated in intermediate
and capital goods producing industries where there exists wide scope for
import substitution.
4.        The policy statement establishes guidelines aimed at preventing
assembly-type-operations, which have a high coqponent of imported inputs.
The details of the guideline are not entirely clear.
5.        The aim of policy will be to prevent the establishment of plants
whose scale of operation is too small to permit production on a competitive
basis.
6.        No new industries will be established within 120 kilometers of
Tehran unless absolutely necessary from the standpoint of the nature of the
product.
7.        Expansion of existing firms will be preferred to the establishment,
of new units producing the same commodity unless this policy results in a
monopoly situation. Existing companies, whose present size is less than
optimal and who are prepared to merge with other companies in order to
realize economies of scale, will get priority treatment in obtaining
licenses.
8.        The next 10 years will be called "the export decade" and special
incentives will be given to promote the export of manufactured goods.
These incentives will include:
a) cash subsidy up to 25% of the value of certain exports will be
made available for a maximum duration of 5 years. These
subsidies will be gradually reduced after that time.
b) exemptions from income taxation. The calculations of such
exemptions has been simplified under a new formula. Profits
on export sales will be calculated by multiplying total
profits by export sales divided by total sales. Exports will
be exempt from all municipal taxes.
c) the Central Bank of Iran will extend credit facilities to
authorized banks for the purpose of financing certain categories
of exports. These credits will be for a term of 3 years and
will carry a nominal inter'est rate.



ANiNEx 15
PDae 2
d) export3 wdill enjoy a S0% discount with respect to port
handling charges.
e) an export guarantee fund will be created for the purpose
of compensating Iranian exporters for losses resulting from
non-payment by their foreign customers.
f) measures will be taken to expediue the refunding of custom
duty and mercantile taxes on imported inputs used in the
manufacture of export items. The Government will announce in
the near future the amounts that can be claimed as refund on
a list of export items.
9.        The aim of policy will be to bring about a more equal distributior
of industrial development among the various regions of Iran. To this end
the foUowing guidelines regarding location decisions are set down:
a) industrial plants catering to local markets in a province will
be located in the same province.
b) industries concerned with the processing of mineral ores will
be located in the vicinity of the mines.
c) industries processing agricultural inputs will be established
in the area where the primary material is cultivated.
d) industries catering to foreign markets will be established in
locations best suited from the standpoint of exports.
10.       In order that the ownership of companies may become more wide-
spread, special encouragement will be given by the Government to make
shares more attractive to the public.
II.       New rules and regulations designed to implement the above policie-F
will be prepared by the relevant ministries and announced at an early date.
