3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The main objectives of the Project as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) dated April 5,



1995 were to: (a) assist EGAT in optimizing its investment. decisions and help meet the system's peak
power demand from the year 2000 onward at least-cost; (b) strengthen the environmental capabilities of
EGAT; and (c) assist the Government in rationalizing the bulk supply tariff to PEA and MEA as a prelude
to the corporatization and privatization of the generation/transmission and distribution utilities. In addition,
the Bank expected, during the Project's tenure, to continue rendering technical advice to the Govemment in
the implementation of power sub-sector and environmental reforms.
The project objectives were consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which
underscored development of infrastructure and improvement in environmental management as Thailand's
priority needs. Utilizing the surplus off-peak capacity of EGAT's large efficient thermal plants, the Project
provided the opportunity for a step increase in peaking capacity at a lower capital cost than that of gas
turbines, and its size was consistent with the Thai system's rapid demand growth in the early 1990s.
Through its long involvement, the Bank had contributed significantly to the Govemment's strategy to
induct private capital to meet the sector's massive investment needs, and progressively restructure,
corporatize and privatize the power industry. The Project provided a vehicle for the Bank's continued
assistance in least-cost investment planning, demand-side management and restructuring and privatization
of the power utilities.
Institutional development under the Project aptly focused on: (a) strengthening EGAT's
environmental management which was necessary for an environmentally and socially sustainable
development of a rapidly growing sector that had been coming under increasing scrutiny by Thai NGOs
and civil society. Bank's involvement also provided the opportunity to assist in demonstrating how
participation of affected people could ensure project success, which was sorely needed after the
unsatisfactory experience in the Pak Mun Hydropower Project; and (b) laying the foundations for a rational
bulk supply tariff structure, devoid of hidden subsidies, which was a prerequisite for the sector's effective
regulation.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original objectives remained unchanged.
3.3 Original Components:
The Project had three main components: (a) the first stage (2x250 MW) of the 4x250 MW Lam
Takhong Pump Storage Scheme (with civil works for the entire 1,000 MW development), the transmission
system, consulting services for design and construction management, and an Environrmental Impact
Mitigation and Development Plan (EMDP); (b) procurement and implementation of environmental
management and monitoring systems/equipment and training of environmental staff; and (c) a consulting
study - "Rationalization of Bulk Supply Tariff for the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the
Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA)". The estimated project cost of US$585.6 million was proposed to
be financed by a Bank loan of US$100 million (for civil works), an OECF (now JBIC) yen loan equivalent
of US$184 million (for the electro-mechanical plant, transmission system and project management), foreign
commercial bank loans and suppliers' credits amounting to US$24.4 million and EGAT intemal
resources/local borrowing to the extent of US$277.2 million.
The design of the Lam Takhong Pump Storage scheme is considered to be sound; it was
under-pinned by adequate technical studies and site investigations. It considered altemative sites 'and
layouts and selected the option that minimized environmental impact. An International Board of Experts
was planned to be involved throughout the design and implementation phases. Project procurement was
- 2 -



well packaged into eight manageable supply and install contracts. While this was the largest installation of
its type in Asia, EGAT's track record in implementing large hydropower plants, supported by international
consultant management services, was rightly considered adequate. The EMDP was well prepared and
budgeted and made provision for participation, grievances redress, monitoring and evaluation. Though it
did not specifically emphasize baseline studies on fishermen, this aspect was given due importance later.
The environmental strengthening program for EGAT filled in the gaps that still persisted in an otherwise
strong Environmental Division, with the objective of bringing it to the level of "Best Practice" in
environmental management. The terms of reference for the study on Rationalization of Bulk Supply Tariff
to MEA and PEA were well drafted.
3.4 Revised Components:
No changes were made to the Project components during implementation.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The quality of entry of the Project is rated as satisfactory. Bank support for pump storage peaking
capacity of such a large scale was in some ways path-breaking and clearly responded to a priority CAS
objective of infrastructure development to support economic growth. Incorporation of measures to
strengthen EGAT's environmental capabilities was a well conceived strategy that responded to the
environmental and social challenges facing a rapidly expanding power sector; it gave apt recognition to the
CAS's priority of improving environmental management in Thailand. Provision for a Bulk Supply Tariff
study and implementation of its recommendations, responded to a long felt need for rationalizing electricity
tariffs in Thailand; it was a vital component in support of Government's overall strategy for reforming the
sector. The Project was technically well designed, had a strong rationale for Bank involvement (especially
in regard to enhancing participatory development) and met the "Bank's Safeguard Policies".
The SAR recognized the risks associated with large hydro projects and considered those risks to be
small on the premises of sound project design and implementation arrangements. Yet the Project suffered a
two-year delay due to contractor deficiencies, power house flooding during commissioning and development
of minor cracks in the upper reservoir. This delay (which could have been reduced if EGAT so desired)
could have had adverse implications for system operation but for the fact that the anticipated rapid power
demand growth did not materialize due to the economic/financial crisis that struck Thailand in 1997. The
SAR could not have foreseen this crisis, which has had a substantial negative impact on the Project's
economic viability.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The overall outcome of the Project is rated as satisfactory. It would have been rated as highly
satisfactory, but for the fact that its economic viability was adversely imnpacted by the 1997
economic/financial crisis that rendered the Project only marginally economically viable. The achievement of
the objective to assist EGAT in optimizing its investment decisions and meet peak demand was fully met
and is rated as satisfactory. Optimization actually related to down-scaling of investments in the face of
faltering demand, rather than up-scaling to meet rapid growth; and this in many ways proved to be more
challenging. Likewise, the issue of meeting system's peak demand became a moot point and led to a holding
of reins on implementation of Lam Takhong (as on many other projects) rather than forcing its pace. The
achievement of objectives on environmental strengthening of EGAT, rationalizing the bulk supply tariffs
and assisting the Government in power sector reforns, is rated as highly satisfactory. An implicit objective
-3 -



of Bank involvement - enhancing participatory approach - was very successfully met.
Assist EGA T in optimizing its investment decisions and help meet the system's peak power
demand from the year 2000 onward. Following the 1997 economic/financial crisis, the Bank advised
EGAT to monitor demand and modify its power development plans, cut down investments ruthlessly,
expedite divestment of thermal plants, and reduce operating costs. EGAT responded by defering many
Independent Power Producer (IPP) projects, canceling several transmission lines and deferring system
improvement programs. Contractual commitments forced it to continue with Lam Takhong. EGAT total
investments over the period 1997 to 2001 were reduced from the original plan level of US$10.5 billion to
US$4.7 billion. While EGAT struggled to maintain its financial health in the face of eroding revenues, the
Government did not let up on annual remittances from EGAT to shore up its own precarious finances, nor
was it agreeable to increase tariffs which was a politically sensitive issue. The Bank, committed to see
Thailand out of the recession, took a sympathetic view and selectively relented on compliance with financial
covenants. EGAT emerged from the crisis in a fairly sound financial position (see financial data in Annex
1).
Strengthen the environmental capabilities of EGAT and during the Project's tenure, continue
rendering technical advice in the implementation of environmental reforms. A major accomplishment
was the installation of an Integrated Environmental Information Management System capable of analyzing
different data required for environmental studies and analysis. Significant technical assistance was engaged
for training of specialists in environmental management. Policies and strategies for environmental and
social management were embodied in and institutionalized through: "EGAT: Corporate Environmental
Policy," June, 1999 and "Strategic Implementation Framework", November, 1999, which sets out
Objectives, Targets and Guidelines for implementation of the Environmental Policy. Interactions of EGAT
Envirornmental Division (ENVD) with power station environmental personnel increased sharply; as a result,
many of EGAT's power plants now have ISO certification. At the Bank's insistence, and with considerable
Bank inputs, EGAT prepared the "Power Sector Environmental Assessment" which defines the
framework/guidelines for environmental assessment of power development plans.
Assist the Government in rationalizing the bulk supply tariff to PEA and MEA as a prelude to
corporatization andprivatization. The original scope of the study was expanded to include development of
criteria for economic regulation, determination of a Uniform Tariff Compensation Payment and
development of a bulk supply contract. The study was completed in December 1996 by the Government's
National Energy Policy Office (NEPO), with the assistance of international consultants. The Bank had
extensive discussions with the Government on the implementation of the study's recommendations. The
1997 economic/financial crisis, however, delayed Government action, and the study's recommendations
were implemented only in 2000, with the coming into effect of a new bulk supply tariff structure.
Significant changes includedc (a) introduction of efficiency considerations in determining revenue
requirements; (b) incorporation of a transparent mechanism for subsidy transfers; and (c) restructuring of
the consumer billing system providing for accounting of transmission and distribution charges.
During the Project's tenure, contnue rendering technical advice to the Government in the
implementation of power sector. As the Thai power sector was already set on a path of reform, the Bank
saw its role as a facilitator rather than an enforcer of reforms or of their pace, and played this role in an
informal, though extensive manner, through - supervision missions, participation in seminars and review
of consultant's terms of reference. Bank's more formal involvement was through the ESMAP initiative
which fielded a tearn of experts to independently review the Power Pool and Electricity Supply Industry
Reform Study conducted by NEPO. The reform program was significantly affected by the 1997
economic/financial crisis, which slowed it down and by the coming into power in 2001 of the new
-4 -



Government, whose intention to review decisions taken by the previous Government, could introduce
changes. The California power crisis also acted as a damper to conversion to a Pool operation. Significant
achievements in sector reform over the past few years include:
*   Government approval in 1998 of a Privatization Master Plan, which outlined a strategy and timetable
for restructuring and privatizing the Electricity Supply Industry.
*   Completion in 1998 of a study for the Regulatory Framework for the Energy Sector and formulation of
the regulatory regime by NEPO.
*   Completion in 1999 of a Thailand Power Pool and Supply Industry Reform Study,
*   Drafting of the Energy Act and its approval by the Cabinet in October 2000, including approval of the
electricity market structure proposed by NEPO. The Office of the State Council, however, decided to
postpone imnplementation of the Energy Act to enable a review of the sector reforn program following
installation of the new Government.
* Drafting of secondary regulations.
*   Restructuring of EGAT, PEA and MEA into business units.
*   Divestrnent of EGAT's Rayong, Khanom and Ratchaburi therrnal power plants.
*   Creation of the Electricity Generation Company (EGCO) and dilution of EGAT's equity.
*   Functioning of about 5,000 MW of IPPs on the grid.
*   Connection of about 3,000 MW of Small Private Power Producers to the grid.
* Announcement in 2001, by the new Government of an Agenda for privatization of State Owned
Enterprises (SOEs) bringing them first under a State Holding Company, and subsequently listing them
on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). The time table for listing is - EGAT in the third quarter and
MBA and PEA in the fourth quarter of FY03.
*   Implementation of the Pool operation has been delayed from the planned FY03 date and is expected to
materialize in FY05, after the Energy Act is revised and approved.
4.2 Outputs by components:
The Project's three main components (outputs) (para. 3.3) were successfully implemented. The
components on EGAT environmental strengthening and the Tariff Study are rated as highly satisfactory
(para 4.1), whereas the physical implementation of the Project per se is rated as satisfactory.
Implementation of the Lam Takhong Pump Storage Project (all sub-components) was achieved as
planmed at appraisal, at substantially lower than estimated cost and in an environmentally and socially
sound manner. Completion was delayed by two years due to - equipment delivery delays, contractual
problems, a mishap during commissioning and appearance of minor cracks in the upper reservoir - but this
had no adverse impact on the power demand situation; in fact in view of depressed power demand, EGAT
saw no need to and did not force the pace of construction. This is an impressive performance by EGAT,
when considered in the context of the Project's size and complexity, being the largest of its type in Asia. At
completion of the ICR mission in December 2001, project construction was 99.9% complete, and
commnissioning tests on Unit 1 (250 MW) about 85% complete. The Project is expected to be filly
operational in August 2002. Commissioning of Units 3 and 4, originally planned within three years of
commissioning Units I and 2, is being postponed to 2010.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Reevaluation of the equalizing discount rate has been carried out on the same lines as in the SAR.
The Project's economic viability has been influenced by major factors, some beneficial and some
detrimental. A highly detrimental factor has been the 1997 economic/financial crisis which led to a slow
-5-



down in electricity demand (demand growth rates were - 1997: +9%, 1998: -2.3%, 1999: -3.3%, 2000:
+8.8% and 2001: +7.2%). As a result, in the reevaluation, it has been necessary to: (a) defer expenditures
on the Stage I set of 6x100 MW equivalent gas turbines to 2004-2006; and (b) defer commnissioning of the
cost-effective Stage II of the Pump Storage Project, requiring no additional civil works, to 2010, with
expenditures on the equivalent 5x 100 MW gas turbines carried over to the years 2009-2011. The beneficial
factors have been: (a) a steeper fall in the cost of the pump storage plant and works (about 45%) than that
of gas turbine systems (about 27%); (b) availability of natural gas for pumping energy (with pipeline
connection to Myanmar) which is more economical than burning heavy fuel oil, assumed at appraisal. The
reevaluated equalizing discount rate (see Annex 3 for details) worked out by EGAT is 10.31% (compared
to 16% during appraisal) and NPV of B416 million at 10% discount rate (compared to an NPV of B2,142
million during appraisal). The Project continues to remain economically viable, but only marginally so,
considering that 10% is the hurdle discount rate stipulated by the National Economic and Social
Development Board (NESDB) for establishing economic viability of projects. This is a stark demonstration
of how drastic can be the impact of system demand slowdown on long-gestation lumpy-investment power
generation projects. The intrinsic benefits of the pump storage scheme in terms of system stability and
spinning reserve remain high (though these have not been quantified at appraisal or in the reevaluation) and
will over the long run prove very beneficial to system operation.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
In spite of the 1997 economic/financial crisis, the financial objectives of the Project, as reflected
through the covenanted financial ratios, were substantially achieved (see Annex 1). Throughout the 7-year
Project period, only on two occasions did EGAT not comply with the financial covenants - SFR in FY97
and FY00 and Debt Equity Ratio in FY99 and FY00 (which resulted in the Project receiving a U rating for
Development Objectives in February 1999). As the overall financial health of EGAT continued to remain
sound, the Bank allowed a relaxation of these covenants in FY99-00. EGAT maintained a sound financial
performance by: (a) prudent financial management; (b) drastic reduction in capital investments; (c)
improvements in operating efficiency; (d) recouping foreign exchange losses from consumers through the
tariff surcharge mechanism; (e) sale of shares in the subsidiary company (EGCO); and (d) sale of
Ratchaburi, Rayong and Khanom power plants. With the power sector steadily moving towards
privatization, Bank's conventional cash generation (SFR) covenant is no longer considered an appropriate
measure of EGAT's financial health, mainly on account of divestiture leading to substantial cash infusions
and EGAT's role being progressively reduced to transmission and hydro operation. At EGAT's request, the
Bank is considering eliniination of the SFR covenant, basing financial monitoring on the more appropriate
covenants of debt service coverage, debt equity ratio, and short term debt limitation.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
Overall, the Project's institutional development impact is rated as high. EGAT's environmental
and social policies have been institutionalized and its organizational and implementation capabilities in
these areas demonstrably improved, as evidenced from its impressive handling of the Project and from its
power plants achieving ISO certification. The impact of the bulk supply tariff rationalization on the
"efficiency culture" of the three Thai utilities has been remarkable and further improvements are expected
as more experience is gained in economic regulation. On the restructuring, corporatization and privatization
front, progress has been impressive in several areas but slow in others; the path in future could be tortuous.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
- 6 -



The 1997 economic/financial crisis that struck Thailand led to a severe reduction in power demand.
The impact of this crisis on Thailand's power development plans was dramatic. While EGAT responded by
substantially cutting down its investments in consultation with the Bank, it had to carry on with projects
already committed and under construction. The rationale for construction of a bulk pump storage peaking
capacity weakened in comparison to the option of augmenting peaking capacity in small incremental steps
through gas turbines.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
No Government actions adversely affected implementation of the Project. The Government did not
agree to raising tariffs or forgoing remittances to meet Bank covenants, but these actions did not have any
significant adverse impact on EGAT's financial health.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
An overall two year delay in project implementation resulted from contractor and commissioning
problems: (a) a delay of one year resulted from: (i) quality problems arising on pump-turbine equipment
from a reputable intemational supplier due to shifting of manufacture to its joint venture company in a
developing country after contract placement, and necessary rectifications taking a long time to accomplish;
(ii) delivery delays for hydraulic equipment from a reputable intemational contractor; and (iii) sub-par
performance of subcontractors engaged initially by the aforementioned main contractors; (b) a delay of six
months resulting from malfunctioning of Unit 1 tail race gate bypass valve and simultaneous leakage in the
rubber seals of the gates for draft tubes of Units I and 2 (during commissioning tests for Unit I in
December 2000), resulting in flooding of the power house equipment, needing dismantling, inspection and
reassembly of all affected equipment; and (c) a delay of six months resulting from the appearance of minor
cracks in the upper reservoir on filling water, due to foundation subsidence, needing strengthening measures
as advised by the Intemational Panel consultants.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The completion cost for the Project was US$318.6 million, about 55% of the appraisal estimate.
This was due to two factors: (a) unduly conservative estimate for civil works by the project consultants;
and (b) the extraordinarily tough competitive situation in the intemational market for power plant
equipment With about a year's cushion in the original loan closing date, the actual closing date had to be
extended by a year from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001 and the Loan surplus of US$12.3
million was cancelled. The utilization of the JBIC Loan went down from US$184 million to US$111.4
million.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is rated as likely. The Project has been constructed in a technically sound
manner and with EGATs long experience in operating complex hydropower projects, it is expected that
EGAT would operate and maintain it successfully. The physical sustainability of the Project is
considered assured. The Project has been constructed with great attention to mitigating environmental
impact and enhancing the surrounding environment. Agreements have been reached with the Bank to
continue monitoring and taking actions on sensitive environmental issues, especially fisheries. The
environmental sustainability of the Project is considered to be high. The social development of affected
persons has been carried out at high levels of excellence. Agreements have been reached with the Bank to
continue monitoring the socio-economic conditions and provide budgetary support for the next five years.
- 7 -



The social sustainability of the Project is thus also considered to be high. The institution-strengthening
measures (environmental management strengthening and bulk supply tariff reform) under the Project are
already bearing fruit. The direction has been set for Government's power sector reforrn, restructuring and
privatization program and several of the reform actions have already taken place. EGAT has
demonstrated its capacity to carry through a restructuring and privatization effort; two of its large
generation facilities were privatized recently, the Rayong Thermal Plant in 1998 and the Ratchaburi
Thermal Plant in 2000. The current Government is cormmitted to privatization of SOEs, including EGAT,
MEA and PEA, although it would like to study carefully the operations and timing of the Power Pool.
Hence, drastic stalling or reversal of the power sector reform process is highly unlikely, although the road
could be tortuous.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
A summary of the understandings between the Bank and EGAT for operation of the Project for the
next 5 years is presented below (see ICR Aide Memoire for details): EGAT will -
*   Monitor the effectiveness of the fish-net barrier installed at the inlet and channel areas located on the
shores of the reservoir during the first year of operation and take appropriate action, including
adjustment of fish-net barrier to ensure that there is no significant adverse effect on fish-life in the
reservoir;
*   Monitor and evaluate the effect of the Project on the ecology, fish populations, and fish catches in the
reservoir for a few years, before putting into effect plans for construction of Stage II (2x250 MW);
*   Continue to support the environmental mitigation and social development program for five years,
providing an allocation of B22 million;
*   Conduct surveys on the socio-economic status of the rehabilitated people and on fish populations and
catches in the reservoir;
*   Furnish semi-annual reports to the Bank for the next five years (2002-06) keeping it informed about
issues and progress, highlighting any changes in plans for operating the Project, and any major issues
relating to the ecological impact of the Project on the reservoir, including any disputes with NGOs or
other interested parties.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank provided adequate expertise in assisting EGAT in the technical preparation of the largest
pump storage project in Asia. Benefiting from the unsatisfactory experience on social issues in the Pak
Mun Hydropower project, the Bank social staff worked with EGAT as a team in developing the EMDP,
emphasizing the need for intensive participation of affected persons and of paying attention to fisheries and
fishermen issues. The Bank correctly foresaw the need for environmental strengthening of EGAT and
encouraged it to make this a project component. The Bulk Supply Tariff study, required by the Bank,
yielded a substantial benefit to the sector reform process. The Bank performance is rated as satisfactory.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank fielded adequately staffed supervision missions, especially in the Project's early stages.
Throughout, the Bank maintained a substantial level of dialogue, largely in an informal manner, with
EGAT and the Government on pricing, sector reform, restructuring and privatization. It showed flexibility
in the face of changing circumstances. In the wake of the 1997 economic/financial crisis, Bank missions
- 8 -



worked closely with EGAT in the revision of its power development plans, strongly emphasizing reduction
of investments and improving operational efficiency. The Bank moved quickly to launch the EGAT
Investment Support Project, under a Partial Credit Guarantee, to help EGAT float international bonds to
shore up its precarious finances. In times of dire economic distress, the Bank took a sympathetic attitude
and desisted from demanding tariff increases, cutting down remittances to the Government or rigid
compliance with its financial covenants. Finally, in the realm of the environment, the Bank was
instrumental in getting EGAT formulate its Corporate Environmental and Social Policy and preparing a
Sector Environment Assessment, two useful instruments in environmental management The Bank
performance is rated as satisfactory.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
The Bank's overall performance is rated as fully satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
EGAT diligently conducted feasibility studies necessary to underpin such a large development and
availed of adequate consulting expertise for project design and management. It copoperated fully with the
Bank in preparing the EMDP. EGAT performance is rated as highly satisfactory.
7.S Government implementation performance:
Government performance is rated as satisfactory. The Government's NEPO conducted several
important studies associated with restructuring of the Power Supply Industry, drafted the Energy Act,
finalized the regulatory regime for the Energy sector, formulated the Power Pool Model and secured
Cabinet approval for its proposals. It introduced the new bulk supply tariff and reforns in the tariff
structure to take into account future utility operations. While implementation of the Power Pool was about
to take off, the new Government stepped in and required the entire Power Industry plan to be reviewed
especially in relation to the ushering in of Pool operations by 2003. The new Government revised the
original model of restructuring and corporatization of EGAT, MEA and PEA and directed that all the three
utilities be privatized by listing on the Thai stock Exchange. This model is currently being pursued
diligently by the three utilities. Pool operation is likely to be pushed back to 2005. The Government aptly
handled the utilities during the economic/financial crisis from which the utilities emerged with sound
positions.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
EGAT effectively utilized advice of the International Panel of Experts at all stages. It conducted
procurement and contract awards in a highly professional and timely manner. It successfully stood its
ground against the consultant's advice in the award of contract for the turbine generator equipment,
refusing to water down its specifications. It astutely withstood the pressure of extra claims amounting to
US$50 million by the Civil Works Contractor, painstakingly undergoing International Arbitration, and
getting the matter settled in its favor for about US$5 million only, most of which it recovered from the
defaulting equipment suppliers. In response to adverse developments during construction/commissioning,
EGAT took correct decisions in: (a) complete dismantling, inspection and re-assembly of plant affected by
a flooding incident in the power house during commissioning; and (b) availing of International Panel's
advice in rectifying minor cracks and subsidence of foundation on the upper reservoir. The two-year delay
that has occurred in project completion due to equipment quality problems, sub-par performance of some
contractors, power house flooding and cracks in the upper reservoir, could have been substantially
-9-



shortened, had EGAT so desired; but actually there was no need to force the pace of construction in view
of the depressed system demand.
EGAT actions in the face of the economic/financial crisis were sound. In hindsight, it could have
made decisions even faster to cut investments, but at no stage was it very clear how soon the economy and
power demand would rebound. EGAT financial and operational management during the emergency were
laudable, enabling it to maintain reasonably sound financial health. While EGAT management did all it
could to force the pace of restructuring and privatization, its efforts were hampered by the strong unions;
nevertheless the momentum towards privatization was maintained, albeit at a slower pace. EGArs
implementation of the EMDP was exemplary as were its efforts towards and results achieved in
strengthening its environmental capabilities. EGAT performance is rated as highly satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrowerperfornance:
Overall, the Borrower's performance is rated as highly satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The following are key lessons learned from this Project: That -
* Technical: (a) Large pump storage schemes can be constructed at much lower than hitherto imagined
capital costs and could provide an economic source of peaking power for systems in which surplus
off-peak energy can be drawn from large efficient thermal or combined cycle plants; (b) Globalization,
leading to large international equipment suppliers moving manufacturing to their facilities in developing
countries could pose equipment quality and delivery problems; (c) An efficient buttress needs to be set
up in the implementing agency's project management resources to countei claims made by Civil
contractors; and (d) Equipment and construction contractor problems could delay otherwise well
designed and managed hydropower projects.
*   Economic/Financial: (a) Sudden economic/financial crisis in a country, especially following a
prolonged period of growth, could severely irnpact power demand and could render large long gestation
power development schemes uneconomic in comparison to (otherwise less economic) smaller ones; (b)
Under crisis conditions, utilities need to exercise great financial discipline, drastically cut down
operating expenses and strike an appropriate balance between curtailing and carrying on with
investments; (c) Under such circumstances, the Bank would do well to take a flexible and sympathetic
approach to government actions and compliance with covenants; (d) Bank's standard cash generation
covenant (SFR) may not be appropriate for utilities undertaking large divestments and moving towards
corporatization and privatization.
* Power Sector Reforms: (a) Hasty decisions in introducing complex power pool operations in a
developing country could prove detrimental; a more cautious incremental approach to reforms, though
prolonged, could pay dividends; (b) A rationalized bulk supply tariff could provide a useful tool for
utility regulation; and (c) The Bank could best play the role of advisor and facilitator for countries that
have already embarked on the path of power sector reforms, recognizing that restructuring proposals
are not cast in stone and could change in line with utility and Government thinking.
*   Social: (a) Involvement in the Project of affected persons early in the game, and acceding to all
reasonable demands in the design of the rehabilitation program, cannot be over-emphasized; (b)
Sympathetic consideration to enhancing the quality of life of nearby communities, not affected by the
Project, could lead to minimization of disparities between those affected and those not (as happened in
the case of the Pak Mun Hydropower project); and (c) Village cooperatives may not prove successful if
not carefully planned from the start.
-10-



*   Environmental: Fisheries need to be given eminent consideration in hydropower projects and all means
adopted to enhance fish catches; and (b) The need for conducting baseline studies on fisheries and on
socio economic conditions of the fishermen, cannot be overemphasized.
9. Partner Comments

NGOs: "...please be informed that NGO "the Assembly of the Poor" and villagers visited our office in mid
May and submitted [to] us a letter claiming for. our responsibility to the villagers on adverse[d]
environmental impact including air pollution occurred during construction of upper pond. We, therefore,
would like to share information on this matter with you."
(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
None.
10. Additional Information
Environmental and Social
EGAT's execution of the EMDP was exemplary and is rated as "highly satisfactory". It was
implemented in a participatory manner reflecting EGAT's new Corporate Enviromnental Policy and its
accomplishments exceeded agreements reached with the Bank under the Project and provisions in its own
EMDP. There were no protests from NGOs or affected persons. The highlights in program implementation
are given in Annex 10 and summarized below. EGAT:
*   Implemented very effective measures to: (a) prevent deterioration and subsequent rehabilitation of
project affected areas; and (b) control sediment leakage from dump sites and its dispersion\into the
reservoir. Monitoring studies testified that reservoir ecology remained healthy.
*   Provided a grant of about B49 million to the Royal Forestry Department (RFD) to carry out forest
rehabilitation and conservation program for about 1,230 ha of forest reserve land in the vicinity of the
Project.
*   Constructed a scenic shore park on reclaimed dumping ground for public benefit Further, during the
Project's tenure a wastewater treatment facility was constructed by the Pak Chong district authorities,
upstream of the Lam Takhong Reservoir.
*   Evolved, with the assistance of the Department of Fisheries (DOF), a Fish Conseration and
Enhancement Program that resulted in significant increase in fish yields over 5 years.
* Publicized the Project and the EMDP for over two years before implementation to help generate public
understanding and support. Ensured full representation from affected people on the Coordination and
Advisory Committee established by the Prime Minister's Office.
* Designed a comprehensive quality of life improverment program with the participation of affected
villagers, and substantially enhanced original plans.
*   Increased the EMD)P budget from B219 million to B256 million.
-11 -



*   Compensated each affected land occupier (though not owning the land) at full replacement cost and in
addition, allotted 1.45 acres of land to each.
*   Extended its quality of life improvement program to a totally unaffected village 7 km away.
*   Built extensive infrastructure, including - 20 km of roads; community water works; a village
community center, a child care center; and a crematorium and housing for monks/nuns.
*   Provided funds for nutrition support programs for children, established a village medical fund to
buttress district health services and periodically provided medical care.
*   Trained villagers in mushroom cultivation, poultry, and cattle breeding. Established a model farm to
demonstrate intensive farming techniques. Established a village cooperative to enable villagers to start
businesses of their own - this, however, did not prove to be successful.
*   Assisted in the construction of the sub-district administration building and a community pavilion to
promote cordial relations with the adjoining sub-district of Khlong Phai.

Additional Annex 8. Aide Memoire
December 4, 2001
AIDE-MEMOIRE
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT)
World Bank ICR Mission
Lam Takhong Pump Storage Project (Loan 3884-TH)
Introduction
1.    A World Bank mission composed of Brahm Prasher (Consultant, ICR), Darayes Mehta
(Consultant, Power) and Rebecca Sekse (Senior Financial Analyst) visited the EGAT between
November 19 and December 4, 2001 to conduct an Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
mission of the above-mentioned project. The mission had extensive discussions with professional
and supervision staff conmected with planning and execution of the project and with EGAT's
corporate management. On November 28, 2001, the mission also visited the project site. This
Aide-Memoire records the mission's main findings and agreements reached with EGAT. (Note:
EGAT's financial perfornance is covered in the Lam Takhong supervision mission Aide Memoire of November
30, 2001.) It would be ratified by Bank management and sent to EGAT soon. The mission thanks
EGAT and its staff for its cooperation, assistance and hospitality.
Project Components
2.    The project is the first phase development (2x250 MW) of a 4x250 MW pump storage
scheme which comprises: (a) a 50 m deep and 9.9 MCM capacity upper pond with a surface area
of 0.3 sq km and 5.4 MCM bounded rock-filled dam lined with an asphalt membrane; (b) two
morning-glory intakes leading to steel lined inclined shafts 6.0 m in diameter and 690 m in length;
(c) an underground power house containing four reversible Francis type generating/pumping
units, each with an output (while generating) of 250 MW at a rated head of 360 m; (d) two
concrete lined tailrace tunnels 6.8 m in diameter and 1,430 m in length; (e) access tunnels to the
power house and the tailraces; and (f) a switchyard and transmission lines.
3.    The project provides for: (a) environmental impact mitigation in the Lam Takhong
reservoir to preserve/improve water quality and ecology; (b) fish conservation/enhancement effort
in the reservoir (fishing being a source of main/supplementary income for fishermen living in the
surrounding area); and (c) rehabilitation of persons affected by the construction of the upper
pond. In addition, EGAT provided budget support to the Royal Forestry Department for
rehabilitation of some degraded areas around the project site in the Khao Tien - Khao Khuanlon
Reserve Forest Area in exchange for land made available to EGAT for construction of the upper
pond and associated facilities.

Review of Physical Components
4.    Overall, the project is about 99.85% complete and commissioning tests are under way.
Unit 1 is scheduled to be commissioned by the end of December 2001 and Unit 2 by the end of
January 2002.-Commissioning of the project has been delayed beyond the revised commissioning
date of mid-2001 due to unexpected contractor lapses during commissioning tests in December
2000. Malfunctioning of the by-pass valve system of Taihrace Number 1 together with a leak in
the seal of the draft tube gates Numbers 1 and 2 caused flooding of the underground powerhouse.
EGAT and its consultant required the contractor to dismantle, clean and check all equipment
affected by the flooding, prior to conducting fresh commissioning tests.
Performance Monitoring Indicators
5.    Power capacity related monitoring target indicators for this project were set in early 1997
before the economic/financial crisis. Actual system capacity to demand ratio (1.48 in FY01) and
system reserve capacity (42% in FY01) have all along exceeded targets (1.40 and 15%,
respectively for FY01) for each of the years from FY98 onward. With Bank acquiescence, EGAT
desisted from trying to achieve installed capacity target indicators to allow for appreciable scaling
down of power demand. The target set for installed capacity for FY01 was 29,200 MW, while
actual installed capacity realization in FY01 is 24,900 MW, thanks to EGAT making substantial
changes in its power generation investment program after 1997.
6.    EGAT has complied with targets set for strengthening of its environmental capabilities
through acquisition of an environmental MIS, upgrading equipment for its laboratories to
strengthen its monitoring activities, and delivery of adequate training programs to its
environmental staff. The mission is pleased to note that in 1999 EGAT formally adopted a
broad-based and comprehensive Corporate Environmental Policy.  This Policy not only
encourages the strengthening and continual modernization of its environmental and monitoring
capabilities but also promotes participation of the public and interested parties in EGAT's
activities, cooperation with local communities to improve the quality of life of people living in
areas associated with EGAT's activities, and interaction with the public in the area of environment
in an open and transparent mode. Adoption of the corporate policy has implicitly rendered the
provisions of the monitoring indicators pertaining to the environment somewhat moot, since the
scope for action resulting from implementation of the policy would surpass any monitoring the
Bank could have required of EGAT.
7.    The target commissioning dates could not be achieved as discussed elsewhere due to
lapses and deficient performance on the part of some contractors. EGAT's project management
was otherwise excellent and EGAT took a sagacious decision through its insistence on contractor
dismantling and inspection of equipment in the power house, following the flooding incident.
EGAT also effectively resolved contractual disputes with the civil works contractor through
arbitration.
Recalculated Equalizing Discount Rate
- 27 -



8.     Since the schedule for installation of Stage II of the project involving Units 3 and 4
(2x250 MW) is uncertain due to the comfortable peaking capacity situation in Thailand, an
equalizing discount rate involving only the first stage (2x 250 MW) and the alternative best option
comprising of 6xlO0 MW gas turbines required to achieve the same loss of load probability was
recalculated as the base case (Case I). The consideration of only Stage I for the recalculation
analysis is in essence a penalty for the ex-poste analysis, since completion cost for Stage I includes
appreciable common sunk cost for the total project (Stages I and II). (Note: The common sunk cost is
with regard to the construction of civil works (two tailraces, power house and foundations, upper pond, two
morning-glory type intakes, penstocks works, outlet and inlet works, access tunnels to the powerhouse and
tailraces) and other associated works for the two stages of the project, which also includes engineering,
compensation and rehabilitation of affected people.) The ex-poste recalculation for the base case
yielded an equalizing discount rate of 20.7%, which exceeds the base case estimate of 16% for
the two stages (4 x250 MW) at appraisal. Lower completion costs at 82% of appraisal estimate is
the main reason for the higher equalizing discount rate. (Note: Due to the highly competitive markets,
bids for civil works, electro-mechanical, turbine-pump and transmission equipment were much lower compared to
appraisal estimates. )
9.     Since EGAT's latest 15 year operating plan suggests lower peaking usage for the Lam
Takhong Stage I project compared to assumptions at appraisal, an equalizing discount rate
analysis involving Stage I of the project and 5x 100 MW of gas turbine alternative (Case II) was
also performed. This (Case II) yields a much lower equalizing discount rate of 12.7%, which is
still above the discount rate of 10% stipulated by NESDB for project acceptability.
Environmental Mitigation and Development
10.   EGAT's execution of the environmental mitigation and development program has been
very satisfactory, and its accomplishments have far exceeded targets and Bank requirements.
Long before project implementation, EGAT had conducted studies to survey the ecological state
and fish resources of the Lam Takhong reservoir, completed surveys of the villagers to be affected
by the project, and sought participation of NGO's, affected people and district officials in
planning/implementation of mitigation strategies. Intensive publicity was conducted to educate
and involve the public and district officials in planning. Committees at the local, sub-district and
district levels consisting of EGAT officials, affected people's representatives, government officials
and NGO representatives were set up to monitor implementation and provide oversight for the
execution of the mitigation programs.
11.   EGAT provided generous support for the mitigation programs as need arose. EGAT
increased the mitigation and development budget to B219 million from the B186 million appraisal
budget just prior to implementation of the project. Subsequently, midway through
implementation, the budget was further increased to B256 million. As of the end of November
2001, with 99.6% completion, total disbursement for the mitigation program stands at B197
million. This is exclusive of B86 million spent by EGAT for supervision of the program.
Environmental Protection
- 28 -



12.    Throughout project execution, EGAT had put in place effective measures to prevent
deterioration of the environment in areas surrounding the construction sites at the upper pond, in
dump areas, as well as in the Lam Takhong reservoir adjacent to the inlet/outlet areas.  To
prevent soil erosion and runoffs, EGAT used soil compaction measures on the slopes, constructed
effective drainage systems, installed runoff water retention/sump devices around dumps and
construction sites, and planted ground cover on bare slopes and rehabilitated sites to prevent
erosion. As the project nears comnmissioning, most of the slopes and dump sites have acquired a
complexion analogous to natural areas which are beginning to blend unobtrusively with
surrounding hills and forests.
13.    Sediment leakage and dispersion into the reservoir during construction at the outlet and
inlet, and dredging of the channel, was contained through use of geo-textile meshed curtain and
construction of a coffer dam at the outlet works. Results of continuing water quality monitoring
studies since the pre-project phase, as well as bio-ecosystem studies conducted by Khon Kaen
University (1997) and Kasetsart University (2000), testify to the effectiveness of measures which
have been taken to prevent deterioration of the reservoir. These studies show that water quality,
as well as ecological health of the reservoir, has not undergone measurable changes or
deterioration as the project was being constructed and completed.
14.   Initiation of the Lam Takhong project and general speculation on its probable effects on
the reservoir in future has also brought to the fore awareness on the need for environmental
protection in the reservoir vicinity. Government officials, especially those in OEPP, and other
interested parties have had a more intense focus on the health of the reservoir recently, especially
in anticipation of the combined effect of the pollution loads on the reservoir resulting from new
industries upstream, communities discharging untreated wastewater, and the expected increase in
visitors to the community park being constructed on the shores of the Lam Takhong reservoir.
15.    The fear of enhanced pollution loads on the reservoir from the districts adjacent to the
reservoir has triggered action for mitigation of the problem. (Note: Especially with expectation of
increase in industrial discharges into the channels/river leading to the reservoir, such as at present the highly
polluting effluent from a chicken slaughtering facility 10 km upstream in Pak Chong district.) As a result of
this public pressure and concerns expressed by OEPP, district authorities in Pak Chong have
finally instituted action in 2001 for construction of a wastewater treatment facility to process
discharge waters flowing into the reservoir. The facility consisting of 3 holding/settling ponds and
aeration facilities is expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2002.
Fisheries Conservation and Development
16.    The Lam Takhong river/reservoir ecosystem has undergone significant modification during
the last three decades or more. (Note: Due to the following: (a) construction of a dam on Lam Takhong
river, a tributary of the Mun River which in turn is a tributary of the mighty Mekhong River; (b) absence of fish
ladder for fish migration up and down the rivers; and (c) stocking of the reservoir by the Department of Fisheries
off and on in the past, even with species alien to the river, e.g. the Nile tilapia which is considered to be a
predatory fish.) The number of species of fish found in the reservoir still approximate about the
same number as that a decade ago; however, fish species weighted distribution has changed.
Further changes in species relative abundance is expected in future as stocking of the reservoir by
- 29 -



the Fisheries Department is often influenced by the economic interests of fishernan who prefer
infusions of fingerlings having high market prices and returns.
17.   Since the commencement of construction, there has been more activity in fisheries
conservation and promotion in the reservoir in response to the concerns and fears expressed by
fishermen who depend on the reservoir for their livelihood or to supplement family income.
Conservation and promotion activity for fish breeding has increased significantly with EGAT's
decision to make annual cash contributions to the Fisheries Department in support of stocking
activities in the reservoir. To date, EGAT has contributed a total of about B20 million in grants to
the Fisheries Department. The annual grants have enabled release of about 3 million hatched fish
fingerlings, and another 3 million of fresh water baby prawns, every year into the Lam Takhong
reservoir.
18.   Prior to project implementation in 1994, surveys showed that there were about 313
fishermen who used the reservoir to either earn most of their income or in a majority of cases
supplement household income. This number has decreased to about 240 in 2001, mainly due to
migrations and change in occupations. The fish catches in the reservoir were about 5 kg/rai just
prior to project implementation. The catches have progressively increased to about 8 kg/rai in
2001, mainly due to the catalytic effects of stocking carried out every quarter since the last six
years.
19.   EGAT informed the mission that it plans to provide further support to this fisheries
conservation and promotion program for a period of five years after project completion, as
discussed further below in this Aide-Memoire.
Compensation and Quality of Life Development
20.   The 80 people affected by the project did not live on land acquired from them for
construction activities in the upper pond area, but lived either in Khao Yai Tiang Village No. 6,
about 2 km away from the upper pond area, or in other distant places within adjacent districts.
The 80 small parcels of land acquired did not belong to the affected people, but these affected
people had over the years encroached on forest land in the Kuanlon Reserve Forest Area which is
under the control of the Royal Forestry Department. Despite this ownership situation, EGAT
provided generous compensation for land acquired. A total of B44.3 million was paid by EGAT
for compensation to the 80 villagers and other villagers for land acquired from them,
compensation for each fruit growing tree and for non-permanent structures found on these plots
of land. The compensation paid for land was at the rate of B30,000 per rai, and for each fruit tree
at a rate of B1,200. Ten make-shift structures, such as cattle pens and sun-shade/resting roofs
were also compensated for a total of B 181,000.
21.   Upon completion of the excavation activities in the upper pond area, the dump sites were
rehabilitated. With previous approval of the Royal Forestry Department, EGAT in 1999 returned
180 acres of land to the affected people from whom land or fruit trees were acquired, after
rehabilitation of the dumping sites. At the behest of the affected people, the formula for
apportioning the land to the affected people was slightly altered from the allocation plan decided
- 30 -



at the inception' of the project.  The new plan provided the 63 eligible project affected
people/families each with a parcel measuring 1.4 acres on which they could farm and grow fruit
trees. The balance of the land comprising the unallocated portion of the 180 acres has been set
aside for common community purposes/use for the villagers and other affected people. Roads
have been provided between the rows of farm plots for access to the plots. Since water is an
important issue for this sparsely rained area, EGAT has constructed a holding pond with capacity
of 80,000 cubic meters into which run-off waters from the slopes can accumulate for use by the
villagers for irrigation of crops/farms.
22.   Recipients of farm land had also been provided with farm implements for their own use,
fruit trees with superior growth and yield habits, fertilizer and other aid for cultivation of the farm
plots. In addition to all the foregoing benefits, a monthly stipend of B 1,400 for a period of two
years was provided to each recipient of land for two years till the end of September 2002. The
stipend was intended for income support for devoting diligent effort to tend to their farms till fruit
trees planted achieve maturity and yield income. Earlier in 1998, the project had set up a
demonstration farm to provide training and knowledge about modem aqua-culture, farming,
animal husbandry, and drip irrigation to the affected people/villagers. A fair number of
demonstration crop plots have also been cultivated with different crops to provide. training and
knowledge to those in the area who desired to benefit from the demonstration programs. Starting
in 1996, EGAT also provided other occupational training programs so that project affected
people and others could supplement their incomes through activities such as mushroom
cultivation in their backyards, beef-cattle farming, and duck, pig and chicken farming.
23.   Midway through project implementation, EGAT decided to extend certain facilities and
assistance to another village about 5 km away from the project area, the village of Khao Yai
Tiang No. 10, so that residents in this village can achieve a level of well-being close to their
relatives in village No. 6 who were affected by the project. Village No. 10 was, however, not
impacted in any way by the project.
Quality of Life Development
24.   At the inception of the project, EGAT, after availing itself with inputs from those affected
by the project and others having interest in the lives of these people, enacted a comprehensive
program to improve the lives of the affected people. EGAT converted the 6 km unpaved road
linking the highway to Khao Yai Tiang Village No. 6 into a metal paved road. It decided to link
Khao Yai Tiang villages No. 6 and No. 10, through a new 7.8 km asphalt paved road. Thus,
residents of Village No. 10 also can now comfortably and safely gain access to the main highway
and to their relatives in Village No. 6. Both, Village No. 6 and village No. 10 were also provided
with a total of 6 km of paved road infrastructure within the villages, in place of the narrow old
dirt roads.
25.   Village No.6 has been provided with an irrigation weir and a water storage facility within
the village with a 20,000 cu meter capacity. A similar arrangement was provided in village No.
10 for storage capacity of 30,000 cubic meters. EGAT also put in place a clean waterworks
system for domestic uses for the two villages. During the project construction period, EGAT
- 31 -



provided mobile medical services about three times a year to between 400 and 450 people in
these villages and other inhabitants around the project area. EGAT plans to continue this service
for a while after project completion, although specific level of assistance has not been defined yet.
26.   Village No. 6, containing most of the affected people, was also provided with two new
community facilities -- a meeting hall and a community center -- early during project
implementation. In addition, EGAT's generosity has also spread to the Khlong Pai sub-district in
which the project is located. The sub-district headquarters has been the recipient of a community
center as well as a district administration center from EGAT.
27.   To promote good relations with the affected villagers and sub-district, EGAT has initiated
a school lunch support program in local schools and extenced some student grants given to
selected students both on the basis of need and excellence. Villages Nos. 6 and 10 have also been
the recipients of nutrition support through grants of pasteurized milk and beverages in their child
care centers for the lunch programs.
28.   Amongst the large number of satisfactory assistance programs extended to the villagers
and other affected people, EGAT's experience with respect to its agricultural cooperative
support program has not been satisfying or successful, perhaps because the concept is too
advanced for the villagers to understand and use in a responsible way. In late 1995, EGAT
extended a 15 year loan without interest in the amount of B24.4 million to the 122 member Khao
Yai Tiang Agricultural Cooperative organized through EGAT's generosity. The cooperative
received an initial infusion of B13.3 million in 1996, from which 89 loans were made to assist
members in farning related and animal husbandry activities. However, except for five of these
loans, none had ever been paid back. As of end of 2001, the cooperative is depleted of funds, and
EGAT has refrained from providing the balance of additional funds it had promised, till the
cooperative is in a position to recoup the major portion of the delinquent outstanding loans from
84 members of the cooperative.
Forest Rehabilitation
29.   EGAT acquired 606 acres of mostly degraded forest land from the Royal Forestry
Department (RFD) for construction of the upper pond, to serve as temporary dump sites for earth
from excavated areas, and for use as construction work sites by contractors on the project. This
acquisition included 80 parcels of fruit farms earlier occupied by the project affected people living
in a village 2 km away from the project and in surrounding districts. In exchange for use of this
land, EGAT had agreed to provide support for the rehabilitation and reforestation of about 1,209
acres of degraded reserved forest land left in poor condition in the vicinity of the project, return
227 acres of land acquired for use by contractors as work site after its reforestation, and, in
addition, also create a community park on the shores of Lam Takhong reservoir on degraded land
temporarily used during construction as dumping site for earth and rock from excavated
underground project site areas.
30.   The degraded forest in the national park has been rehabilitated and replanted with trees.
The mission observed some of these areas, and noted that trees and undercover seen in some
- 32 -



areas are growing healthily. The RFD also conducts regular surveillance of rehabilitated areas to
prevent fires, encroachment and improper use of the forest land. The mission was informed that
the young trees planted are regularly tended to, since this is an area of sparse rainfall, especially
during the dry and hot seasons. In addition to the reforestation work concluded this year, the
RFD had also created 12 weirs in the watershed area to conserve water and prevent erosion. Part
of the work sites evacuated by contractors have been rehabilitated and reforested; the rest would
complete reforestation soon in a few months.
l
31.    The site previously used for dumping earth on the shores of Lam Takhong reservoir has
been converted into a pristine community park which has been treed beautifully and provided lawn
cover for the benefit of visitors. It has also been provided with public facilities for the
convenience of visitors to the community park.
32.    EGAT has to date provided budget support in the amount of B3 1.1 million to the RFD for
rehabilitation of the forest area in the reserve forest. In addition, it has also spent B17 million for
restoration and reforestation work in the soil disposal areas.    As discussed later in this
Aide-Memoire, EGAT plans to allocate budget support to the RFD for the next five years for
monitoring, further replanting if and when necessary, and tending to the planted acreage in
rehabilitated areas.
Agreements and Understandings
33.    The following agreements were reached by the mission with EGAT:
(a)    At the sites adjacent to the inlet and channel areas of the project, EGAT will monitor the
state of the reservoir with regard to the effectiveness of the fish-net. (Note: The effect of operation of
the pump storage project, together with the effectiveness of the fish-net arrangement for preservation of fish-life,
must be closely observed and evaluated for the first year of operation, especially taking into account the effect of
seasonal variations of water levels in the reservoir. This monitoring should focus on both small and large fish-life
in the reservoir area adjacent to the inlet and fish-net. EGAT shall consult with appropriate consultants and
Fisheries Departnent officials at the reservoir to tailor solutions expeditiously for any adverse effects to fish-life
and ecology which may become apparent through this monitoring investigations and operation of the pump
storage project.)
(b)    EGAT will monitor and evaluate the effect of the pump storage project on the ecology of
the reservoir, fish populations in the reservoir, and fish catches for a few years, before putting into
effect plans for construction of Stage II (2 x 250 MW) of the pump storage project.
(c)    EGAT will continue support of the environmental mitigation and social development
program around the Lam Takhong project for a further period of five years, even though EGAT
will have essentially fulfilled in a few months most of its responsibilities under the project. EGAT
will allocate a total of not less than B22 million in support of the program over the five year
period (2002 - 07) involving the following specific activities, participating parties, and budgets:
a.     Monitor water quality and aquatic biology of the Lam Takhong reservoir and the upper
pond (OEPP/EGAT; B4 million).
- 33 -



b.    Monitor fisheries resources in the reservoir (DOFIEGAT; B2.5 million).
c.    Conduct surveys on the social and economic conditions of inhabitants of Villages No 6
and 10, and fishermen deriving their income/catches from Lam Takhong reservoir (EGAT; B2
million).
d.    Promote quality of life and development awareness and activities for the community
around the project area (EGAT; BI million).
e.    Support fingerling and baby prawn stocking activities in Lam Takhong reservoir
(DOF/EGAT; B10 million). The objective for continuation of this activity is to ensure that fish
catches will equal or exceed those existing prior to the operation of the project.
f.    Provide budget for an activity to support water resource management in Lam Takhong
reservoir; specific details of the activity to be formulated soon (EGAT/RID; B1 .5 million).
g.    Continue the community relations, communication, and publicity program to promote
harmony and cordial relations with the public, district authorities and affected people in the
project area (EGAT/local government agencies; BO.8 million).
34.   EGAT will furnish semi-annual reports to the Bank for the next five years (2002-2006)
keeping it informed about progress in all spheres of activities outlined in para. 33 above,
highlighting any material changes in plans to operate the Lam Takhong project, any major issues
relating to the ecological impact of the project on the reservoir and disputes with NGO's or other
interested parties relating to environmental and ecological effects of the project.
Next Steps
35.   EGAT will submit its own evaluation report to the Bank by February 28, 2002. The Bank
will submit a draft ICR to EGAT for review and comment by April 30, 2002. The ICR has to be
finalized and printed by June 30, 2002

Additional Annex 9. Borrower's Evaluation
LAM TA KHONG PUMPED STORAGE PROJECT UNITS 1- 4
First Stage 2 x 250 MW
IBRD Loan No. 3884-TH
Borrower 's Evaluation Report
1. Thailand's economic growth rate in 1989 was marked at 11%, being prominent among
Asian developing nations. Particularly, the growth of its industrial sector was significant. The
Thai Government has a policy of utilizing indigeneous energy sources such as natural gas,
lignite, hydropower etc., while suppressing the increase of oil importation as much as possible.
In the view of the policy situation mentioned above, hydroelectric power resources
development in Thailand has been carried out through many large-scale projects through out
the country. As a result of these developments, it may be that the remaining possible large
scale hydroelectric power resources coping with the peak demand are limited mainly to
international rivers such as the Mekong river and the Salawin river, so that it is very hard to
imagine that the development will be realized in the near future.
Under such circumstances, keen attention has been focussed recently on the Lam Ta Khong
Pump Storage Project which is close to Bangkok metropolitan area, the biggest demand area
of electricity in Thailand.
In order to cope with the high growth of electricity demand, especially peak demand, a
feasibility study on the Lam Ta Khong Pump Storage Project was requested to the Japanese
Government by the Thai Government in 1988.
In 1990, the study of feasibility for Lam Ta Khong Pump Storage Project was prepared by
Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under a technical cooperation program of the
Government of Japan. The study completed in November 1991 by issuing the report
"Feasibility Study on Lam Ta Khong Pump Storage Development Project". This report
examines thoroughly the technical and economical feasibility for installation of the
pumped-turbine and generator-motor in underground powerhouse.
In July 1992, EGAT had submitted the project (including with Environmental Impact
Assessment Report studied by Khon Kaen University) to the National Economics and Social
Development Board (NESDB) for consideration.  NESDB had approved the project on
December 20, 1993 and submitted to the Cabinet for acknowledgment on February 15, 1994.

Project Objectives
2. The key objectives of the project were: (a) develop and utilize hydroelectric power
resources in Thailand by using the water in the existing reservoirs; (b) utilizing the surplus
off-peak capacity of EGAT's thermal plants; (c) provide the opportunity to assist an increase
in peaking capacity at a lower capital cost than that of gas turbines; and (d) strengthen
reliability and stability of the power system.
3. The objectives of the project have been satisfactorily achieved and remained unchanged
throughout the project cycle.
Project Description
4. The project components comprised: (a) the first stage ( 2x 250 MW ) of the 4x 250 MW
Lam Ta Khong Pump Storage scheme with civil works for the entire 1,000 MW development;
(b) an upstream reservoir of 9.9 MCM capacity; (c) an underground powerhouse of all the
four units; (d) conduit systems comprising tunnels and penstocks; (e) 2x 230 kV
double-circuit transmission lines of about 15 km length; (f) an outdoor switchyard; (g)
consulting services for design and construction management; (h) an Environmental Impact
Mitigation and Development Plan for affected persons; (i) pumping during off-peak hours of
about 9 MCM of water from the existing Lam Ta Khong reservoir to the new upper reservoir;
and (j) releasing water into the Lam Ta Khong reservoir to generate power during peak
period.
5. The estimated project cost of US$586 million was proposed to be a Bank loan of US$100
million (for civil works), an OECF yen loan equivalent of US$184 million (for the
electromechanical plant, transmission system and project management), foreign commercial
bank loans and suppliers' credits amounting to US$24.4 million, and EGAT internal
resources/local borrowing to the extent of US$277.2 million.
6. There were no significant changes made to the project components during implementation.
Achievement of Project
7. Based on the Loan Agreement No.3884-TH, the project had met the Loan Agreement and
financial covenants and the achievement of project objectives is rated as satisfactory.
Construction of the first stage of the Lam Ta Khong Pump Storage Project and its associated
transmission system was fully achieved as planned and lower than estimated cost. It was
accomplished in an environmentally and socially sound manner.Completion was delayed by
two years due to equipment delivery delays, contractual problem, a mishap during
commissioning and appearance of minor cracks in the upper reservoir but this had no adverse
impact on the power demand situation in view of depressed power demand. The closing date
of the loan was extended from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001 and the loan surplus
of US$12.3 million was cancelled. The overall satisfactory result of the project should be
- 36 -



credited to the Bank Mission, the Government agencies for their valuable recommendation
and good cooperation which greatly contributed to the efficient carrying out of the project.
8. At the end of March 2002, the   project construction was 99.9%  complete and
commissioning test on Unit 1 was about 85% complete.The project is expected to be full
operational in November 2002. The completion cost for the project was US$326 million,
about 56% of the appraisal estimate due to unduly conservative estimate for civil works by the
project consultants and the keen competitive situation in the international maket for plant
equipment.
9. On the environmental issue, all items have been successfully executed in accordance with
the Environmental Mitigation and Development Plan (EMDP) and with the full support from
the involved governmental agencies. The Bank'performance during the implementation phase
and in supervision of the project is also creditable. The Bank has been in close and continuous
touch with EGAT on the environmental issues.There were no protests from NGOs or
affected persons throughout the period of construction.
Performance of the Bank
10. Overall, the Bank's performance from EGAT's viewpoint was highly satisfactory. During
project implementation, the Bank successfully maintained good working relationships with
EGAT. The Bank personnel provided appropriate and valuable advices to EGAT and every
parties concemed with project conduction. The quality of the Bank supervisory staff was very
high standard and committed to the achievement of the project goals as evident in support
given for the granting of the extensions to the project closing date. In addition, regarding
grant disbursement, the Bank was very cooperative and helpful to EGAT as well.
Future Operation
11. The future operation of the project will be the responsibility and will be closely followed
up by Lam Ta Khong Hydro Plant of EGAT. EGAT has a very capable operation and
maintenance staffs to efficiently operate its facilities. Comprehensive and well-documented
operation and maintenance procedures are in place to ensure proper operation and
maintenance of the new facilities. Any faulty equipment will be promptly replaced to ensure
high system reliability. With the transmission network system, the project can also be operated
by remote control from Ubol Ratana Dam at Khon Kaen province or from EGAT's head
office.
Lessons Learned
12. EGAT gains valuable lessons from implementation of this project as following issues:
(a) Many international equipment suppliers moving their manufacturing facilities to
the developing countries tend to reduce cost. This could pose low equipment quality and late
delivery;
- 37 -



(b) Sudden economic/financial crisis in a country could severely impact power demand;
(c) Closer supervision of EGAT personals and good cooperation between EGAT, the
Consultant and the Contractors are essential for the project success;
(d) Developing an agreed policy and implementation framework for resettlement and
preparing the action plan acceptable to the affected groups at the very start of the project is
essential so that subsequent changes are minimized and costs are kept within budget; and
(e) Setting up of baseline studies on fisheries and on other related topics are needed to be
performed before the start of project implementation.

Additional Annex 10. Mitigation
Environmental Imvact Mitiaation
EGAT instituted and implemented very effective measures to prevent deterioration of and
subsequent rehabilitation of areas affected by project construction, including: (a) compaction of slopes; (b)
construction of drainage systems, with sump areas to hold runoffs and weirs on sumps and ponds to settle
suspended matter, (c) adoption of a comprehensive program of planting ground cover on slopes and in
dump areas; (d) reclamation of a large fraction of the dumping area by planting of trees to blend with
surrounding forests; (e) use of a geo-textile mesh curtain around the inlet channel during dredging and
outlet construction areas, to control sediment leakage from dump sites and its subsequent dispersion into
the reservoir; (f) construction of a coffer dam prior to construction activities at the channel and outlet
works on the reservoir shores to contain sediment leakage/dispersion into the reservoir, and (g) regular
water spraying to minimize atmospheric dust levels. As compensation for 218 ha of land released to it for
the Project, EGAT provided a grant of about B49 million to the Royal Forestry Department (RFD) to
reforest about 1,213 ha of degraded reserve forest land adjoining the project area. EGAT plans to provide
more funds for the next five years to ensure sustenance of the plantings. Finally, EGAT constructed a
scenic shore park on reclaimed dumping ground for the benefit of the public. Environmental, ecological and
monitoring studies on the reservoir conducted by Khon Kaen University (1997), and Kasetsart University
(2000) testified that water quality in the reservoir had not measurably changed, the lake ecology remained
healthy, while fish catches improved significantly. The construction of a wastewater treatrnent facility by
the Pak Chong district authorities has put to rest concerns for increasing pollution discharges into the
reservoir from upstream communities.
Fisheries
Years before initiation of construction, EGAT had conducted studies through reputed universities
to establish base line data on the state of the reservoir, its fish populations, fishing yields, ecology and
environmental quality. In view of changing socio economic conditions around the reservoir and in the light
of experience at Pak Mun, EGAT through the Khon Kaen University conducted a study to update the
previous studies on the reservoir and to establish the latest base line data on the number of fishermen living
off the reservoir, fish catches, income from fisheries and the socio economic conditions of the fishermen. To
ameliorate concerns of fishermen using the reservoir for their livelihood, EGAT with the assistance of the
Department of Fisheries (DOF), evolved a Fish Conservation and Enhancement Program. A budget support
of B25 million from EGAT over five years to the DOF subsidized fish stocking operations in the reservoir,
establishment of a fish conservation station, conduct of publicity campaigns and training and enforcement
of sound fishing practices. According to the latest survey data in 2001, fish and prawn catch was as high
as 267,136 kg. EGAT plans to provide further support to the fisheries program for the next five years.
Social Rehabilitation
EGAT's execution of the social development program was exemplary. It was implemented in a
participatory manner reflecting its new Corporate Environmental Policy and its accomplishments exceeded
agreements reached with the Bank under the Project and provisions in its own Development Plan. The
following are its highlights:
The Prime Minister's Office in 1994 appointed a Co-ordination and Advisory Committee with
representatives from concemed agencies, affected people and local officials. The Committee appointed six
- 39 -



subcommittees to guide and monitor implementation
The Project and the Development Plan were comprehensively publicized through local and national
media, publications and seminars, for more than two years before its implementation to help generate
public understanding and support. Monthly meetings were conducted by project staff with provincial and
district administrations and project documentation were made accessible.
A comprehensive program was designed with the participation of affected villagers, district
authorities and other interested people to improve quality of life and family income and original
development plans were substantially enhanced.
EGAT increased the development plan budget from B219 million at appraisal to B256 million. By
2000, B197 million had been spent and the balance would be available to the executed programs until
2006. This is exclusive of the B86 million incurred by EGAT for supervision of the program.
Though land acquired for the project from the encroachers/occupants was not owned by them,
compensation was paid for the land and fruit trees at full replacement cost. In addition, each of the 63
qualified affected land occupiers was allotted 1.45 acres of reclaimed land to set up fruit and other crop
farms for themselves while, at their request, about 61 acres of land was set aside for communal purposes.
Each of the affected households was provided with high yield fruit trees, fertilizer, and farm
implements and B 1,400 per month for two years.
Although persons in only one village (No. 6) were affected by the Project, EGAT extended its
quality of life improvement program to a totally unaffected village (No. 10) 7 km away. As a result, the
number of benefiting individuals was increased to 132 from 74 at appraisal.
EGAT built or rehabilitated extensive infrastructure in villages Nos. 6 and 10, including: (a) 20 km
of in-village and interconnecting roads; (b) irrigation weirs and community clean water works for the two
villages and a community pond for village No. 6; (c) a village community center and community pavilion in
village No. 6; (d) a child care center in each village; and (e) a crematorium and housing for monks and
nuns, and other public facilities in village No. 6.
EGAT provided funds for nutrition support programs for children in the two villages and provided
medical care periodically every year through mobile medical units. A village medical fund was established
to buttress the health care services being provided by the Khlong Phai sub-district medical center.
Project affected people found employment with construction contractors. In addition, EGAT: (a)
designed an occupational development and training program to assist villagers in supplementing their
incomes; (b) developed demonstration programs to train villagers in mushroom cultivation, poultry, duck
and cattle breeding and milk production from cattle; (c) established a model farm to demonstrate intensive
farming techniques; (d) established a village cooperative to enable villagers to start businesses of their own;
and (e) trained eight individuals in merchandising. A total of 54 villagers took advantage of the various
training programs.
To promote cordial relations with the adjoining sub-district of Khlong Phai, EGAT assisted in the
construction of the sub-district administration building and a community pavilion. It provided funds for
lunch programs in schools and set up funds for prizes, scholarships, loans/grants for meritorious school
students in the sub-district.

The setting up of a Cooperative (under supervision of the Si Khui District Cooperatives) and
provision of B13.8 million of 15-year interest free loans to  help villagers set up businesses was not
successful. Eighty nine of the 122 members of the Cooperative accessed funds; except for 5, none have
made reimbursements. EGAT has resolved not to make a second infusion of B 11.1 million it had promised,
until the cooperative is returned to solvency.
A plan for monitoring the results of the social rehabilitation program for the next five years has
been formulated.
EGAT plans to monitor project operation, examine diligently operation data and results, and take
remedial measures to mitigate and reverse any adverse effects apparent from operation of the Project. The
Bank will be apprised of any changes in project operation in relation to effects on ecology near the inlet and
channel areas. At sites adjacent to the inlet and channel areas on the shores of the reservoir, EGAT will
monitor the state and ecology of the reservoir with regard to the effectiveness of the fish-net barrier. EGAT
plans to institute, in the event it becomes necessary, counter-measures to prevent passage of fish up the
channel into the tailraces during pumping of water into the upper-pond. EGAT also plans to consult with
the DOF personnel stationed at the reservoir, and other consultant authorities on fish life, to ameliorate any
adverse effects, when necessary.
EGAT will also monitor and evaluate for a few years the effect of the pump storage operations on
overall fish catches, ecology and fish populations in the reservoir, following completion of the Project
before putting into effect plans for construction of Stage II (2x250 MW) of the pump storage project.
