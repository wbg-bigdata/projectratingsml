Block 1: Project Description
0. Background:
Madagascar is at a watershed in its development. After a long period in the 1970's and 1980's during which the economy and
standard of living have declined, compounded by a decline in education from the early 1980s, Madagascar is now at the point where,
with international support, it could begin to achieve a fundamental turnaround. Since the early 1990's, the commencement of
democratization in society at large has prepared the groundwork for reform. From an emphasis on state-controlled, top-down
approaches, Government has begun to enlist the efforts of a diversity of partners in the reform of its economy and its education
system, recognizing the contribution of the private sector, local communities and non-goverrunental organizations (NGOs) as
indispensable to economic, social and educational progress. With the signature of the agreements with the IMF, the World Bank
and the Paris Club in late 1996 and early 1997, an appropriate macroeconomic framework has been forged which has the
commitment of a govermment with an increasing capacity to carry through the necessary reforms. Its priorities are firmly locked
onto those of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), emphasizing growth and human resource development as key to poverty
reduction.
To strengthen human resources, the Government has formulated detailed plans for each of the sub-sectors of education and training,
as well an integrated master plan (PNAE II) (December 1997), building on the experience of the PNAE I (initiated in 1989 and
supported in part by an IDA-financed Credit, CRESED Cr. 2094-MAG; see Annex 11 for details) and extensive consultation over
the last two years. An inter-ministerial committee and an inter-sectoral working group have been established in order to ensure the
coherence of the commitments of all partners in the sector.
The objectives of PNAE II shared by all sub-sectors and donors are: (a) to achieve as rapidly as possible universal access to a quality
primary education, (b) to support a gradual expansion and improvement of secondary education, (c) to modernize and diversify
higher education and (d) to continue the reforms in vocational training initiated in 1992 and supported by PREFTEC (Cr. 2382-
MAG) which is expected to close on June 30, 1998.
The proposed Credit (US$65 million) would assist the Govermnent of Madagascar in financing its Program (total cost estimated at
US$183 million) in the education sector, over a five-year period. A separate follow-up operation to PREFTEC to continue reforms
in manpower training is envisaged in the second half of 1998. While several other donors are expected to cofinance the Program,
the operations planned under the proposed Credit are designed to achieve results even if cofinancing does not fully materialize.
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The project supports the development objective of the Education Sector Program to produce more and better trained students at all
levels of education at sustainable cost. The impact of the Program would be measured through improvements in learning outcomes,
in internal and external efficiency of education, and in access to primary and secondary education, particularly in rural areas. The
strategic orientation adopted is centered on the devolution of responsibility to local and institutional levels, supported by a set of
coherent policies at the national level.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation Period: 1998-2003
Executing Agencies: Ministries of Primary and Secondary Education (MINESEB) and Higher Education (MINESUP)
Program oversight: this will be the responsibility of the inter-ministerial committee which was established in February 1997.
The inter-ministerial committee comprises a wide representation of higher level staff in the key ministries (MINESEB, MINESUP,
Ministry of Vocational Training, Finance, Budget and Public Service). The first meeting between the inter-ministerial committee
and donors took place in April 1997. After the adoption of the Program by Govermment (December 1997), it is expected that the
committee wi1l be transformed into a working group of staff who will ensure overall coordination of program- and project-supported
activities within the ministries in charge of education as well as with donors.
Program Coordination: the Program Coordinator will act as Executive Secretary of the inter-ministerial working group.
Specifically, the working group will coordinate: (a) preparation of annual work programs in close collaboration with implementing
agencies; Qb) review of performance on previous work programs, incorporating lessons learned and recommending necessary
changes; (c) development of standard operating procedures and common implementation mechanisms where appropriate and cost
effective; and (d) implementation of beneficiary assessments and impact evaluation studies. The working group will prepare an
annual progress report on the Program which will be submitted to Government for discussion and dissemination.
Project Coordination: the overall project coordination will be undertaken by a Project Management Unit (PMU) headed by a
Project Coordinator who will be assisted by five managers in charge of: (a) all project-financed activities at primary level; (b) all
project-financed activities at secondary level; (c) the Executive Secretariat of the Fund for the Development of Higher Education
(EDES); (d) the procurement unit; and (e) the accounting unit. Implementation of school- and community-based sub-projects will be
monitored by MINESEB staff at regional (6), district (112) and sub-district (1,250) levels. In higher education, the Fund for the
Development of Higher Education (FDES) will be managed by an independent Council comprising representatives of Government,
the private sector, institutions and the business world.
Planning, accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: the implementation arrangements and processes are
detailed in a Project Implementation Manual (1M) prepared by Government in consultation with the Bank and other donors. The IM
describes the processes and implementation arrangements for school- and community-based sub-projects, including the planning
cycle, progress monitoring, financial reporting and account auditing. The finalization of this Manual, including the specific
procedures governing IDA funds disbursement, is a condition of Effectiveness. An annual planning and budgeting process will be
critical to the effective implementation of the project, and is detailed in the Manual. Each year, school districts with assistance from
regional authorities will prepare annual work plans and funding requests. The development of a satisfactory accounting system at
the district and national levels is a condition of effectiveness. Quarterly progress reports will be sent to Government and donors,
and project accounts and the FDES will be audited annually. In addition to the auditing of all project accounts, a procurement audit
will be conducted of expenditures incurred by communities, by an independent auditor.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: a detailed monitoring and evaluation system is being developed as part of the NM.
With the guidance from the inter-ministerial committee and the Program Coordinator, project monitoring and evaluation will be a
shared responsibility of the central MRNESEB and School District staffs. The monitoring system, which will be computerized, will
inform the management, policy makers and donors on the progress of activities and outputs of the Program on the ground.
Monitoring of outputs will be based on data collected at local, district and regional levels, and aggregated by MINESEB, MINESUP,
and the FDES, as well as from annual statistics produced by implementing agencies. Impact on poverty reduction and participation
of local communities will be monitored through beneficiary assessments, and learning achievement in core subjects at primary and
secondary levels will be evaluated bi-annually through achievement tests. Performance indicators include: increase in new intakes in
Grade 1; reduced drop-out and repetition rates in each class; improved attendance of pupils and teachers; higher proportion of
children reaching standards at the end of the cycle; frequency of teacher's use of new teaching skills; ratio of children with textbooks
and school implements; reduction of disparities between urban and rural areas in access to secondary education; proportion of

Block 2: Project Rationale
S. CAS objective(s) supported by the project  Latest CAS discussion: 16249-MAG, February 18, 1997
The proposed Program is in line with the CAS objective of human capital development in support of high growth and meaningfil
poverty reduction within a generation. Specifically, the Program aims to overshoot CAS objectives of primary net enrollment ratio
of 70% by 1999 (compared to 62% now), and 2,000 schools rehabilitated nationwide. However, in view of the limited scope to
increase public expenditure in the education sector in the short term, the CAS objective of increasing education expenditure to 3.5%
of GDP (from 1.5% at present) is likely to be met only in the medium to long term (e.g. by 2005) once fiscal revenues increase as a
result of economic growth. A key focus of this Program is to assist in the empowerment of local communities, especially in rural
areas, to manage and finance their human capital development, an aim which is also central to the CAS. In addition, the Program
aims at reducing inequities in distribution of public resources through reallocation of public expenditures toward provision of basic
supplies to schools and pupils in rural areas. The establishment of the FDES in higher education also supports the CAS's emphasis
on economic opening. More generally, control of demographic growth - which is not a stated CAS objective but a fundamental
basis for per capita income growth -- is closely tied to education levels of the population.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Sector work has included a World Bank study on factors to improve efficiency in primary and secondary education (Madagascar -
Towards a School-Based Strategyfor Improving Primary and Secondary Education, April 7, 1995, Report No. 13450-MAG), and a
series of studies financed under the on-going CRESED Project (Cr. 2094-MAG, approved in February 1990) on educational
achievement, barriers to participation, and higher education development plans. An evaluation by the French Cooperation has
identified as a major issue the poor quality of education. Also, the MINESEB has been experimenting with methods for ministry-
community collaboration in improving primary education since end of 1993, supported by the on-going IDA-financed CRESED
(referred to as the PRAGAP Program) and UNICEF-financed project (referred to as the DINA Project) (see Annex 11 for detailed
observations, results and recommendations). In addition, with support from a Japan PHRD Grant, the MINESUP has prepared a
Master Plan for the development of the sector and initiated important institutional development projects related to quality assurance.
These studies and experiments have documented the following issues:
* Low allocation of public resources to education in general (1.5% of GDP in 1997, compared to an average of 3.6% in SSA);
* Declining participation in primary and secondary education (Madagascar had nearly achieved universal primary education in the
early 1980's) due to deteriorating financial conditions, poor school management and perceived low quality of public schooling;
* Inefficient utilization of human and financial resources at all levels of the education system, e.g. poor distribution of teachers in
rural areas and inefficient deployment of teachers in secondary schools
. Low internal and external efficiency in higher education which Government has begun to address in 1992 through a program of
'assainissementr of public universities (reducing the total number of students from about 44,000 in 1992 to nearly 18.000 in 1997);
* Uneven access to basic education, especially in isolated areas of the country due to poor infrastructure and inadequate
communications;
* Inequitable access to secondary education, especially in rural areas;
Insufficient supervisory and advisory services to teachers; and
* Lack of instruments and information systems to maximize coordination of donor efforts and inputs.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The program will:
1. Reassess the financial rationale of public investments in education
* Increase allocation to education sector (as public resources become available) and share allocated to primary education;
* Improve efficiency of utilization of Government resources allocated to education;
* Optinize utilization of community resources;.
* Increase beneficiary contributions, particularly in higher education;
* Maximize private funding for education sector at secondary and higher education levels;
* Privatize non-essential functions in higher education.
2. Increase education efficiency
* Improve teacher deployment and utilization;
* Improve teaching and learning;
* Reduce repetition and drop-out;
* Increase the number of pupils completing the primary cycle while reducing drop-out and repetition rates;
* Provide universal access of children in schools to textbooks and supplementary materials;
* Increase and improve teacher professional support and development;

* Improve education administration and management of teacher career patterns.
3. Universalize access to quality primary education
a Engage communities in contract with authorities to: maintain physical infrastructure; monitor delivery of quality pnmary
education; and ensure full commitment and increased motivation of teachers;
* Provide materials and professional support;
* Reduce urban-rural inequalities.
4. Improve access to secondary education
I Improve provision of secondary education, particularly in rural areas;
* Improve deployment and utilization of teachers and physical infrastructure;
* Empower groups of local communities to establish, develop and enhance the provision of lower secondary education in their area;
* Improve quality of teaching and learning;
* Reduce repetition and drop-out;
5. Modernize and diversify higher education
* Improve efficiency of utilization of public resources allocated to higher education while reducing their overall share of the total
sector budget;
* Increase participation of private sector;
* Diversify sources of financing for higher education;
* Increase internal and external efficiency;
* Improve quality of higher education on basis of regional and international comparisons.
6. Enhance donor coordination
* Share and support common understanding of the Govermnent's program (PNAE II);
* Develop management information systems to: assist local authorities and communities in planning and implementing their
contributions to education; monitor performance; and provide adequate coordination of donor efforts.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
* Standard ad hoc investment projects vs. sector investnent approach (programmatic). Given a general consensus on policy and a
series of associated action plans for sub-sectors and the sector as a whole, the Govermnent is now in a better position to marshal its
own efforts and those of donors under its Program (PNAE II).
* Input-driven approach (where the budget is an outcome of projected needs) vs. a planning approach which is attentive both to the
budgetary constraints and to the potential social and economic efficiency gains of community participation. In essence, the
approaches differ in the way in which needs are identified and translated in budget allocation and resource utilization. A planning
approach was selected because of its fit with experiments conducted over the last three years and the need to rationalize and
prioritize investments.
* Centrally-managed personnel functions vs. decentralized approach to staff management. One of the major issues in the sector is
the uneven distribution and underemployment of civil servants (teaching and administrative staff) at all three levels. The policy of
centrally-managed redeployment of staff adopted in the early 1990s has not proved successful. However, redeployment at local level
(within school districts) has shown itself to be a satisfactory policy option (for example, under the PRAGAP more than 200 teachers
have been transferred to rural primary schools). The Program will address this central issue through a number of interrelated
strategies, such as: (i) shift responsibility of personnel management from the Ministry of Civil Service to the technical ministries
(MINESEB and MINESUP) which in turn will delegate responsibility to provincial / regional authorities; (ii) deconcentrate payment
of salaries at provincial / regional level; (iii) introduction of establishment of staffing by institution based on allocated posts at school
level ("gestion par poste budgetaire"); (iv) allocate budgetary resources to district-level offices for redeployment of staff at local
level; (v) community recruitment and local training of primary level teachers; (vi) time limits for staff who are surplus to need to
find an alternative position within institutional establishments for staffing; (vii) payment by number of hours taught at secondary and
higher education levels, combined with increase in the mandatory workload at higher education level, plus a freeze on new
recruitment and an increase in fixed-term appointment; (viii) establishment of secondary schools on local initiatives by local
authorities, business enterprises, groups of parents; and (ix) sub-contracting by Government of management of secondary schools
(and some facilities in higher education) to private groups (mostly religious organizations).
* Top-down approach vs. community participation and school-based project. Recent evaluated experience of several donors
(UNICEF, World Bank, Aide et Action, FID - see Annex 11) has demonstrated the effectiveness and sustainability of local
community-based development operations at primary level. These experiences have also informed policy-making in the design of
the Government's Program (PNAE II).
* Public provision vs. private provision of secondary and higher education. For the foreseeable future, Government resources will
be insufficient to cover the totality of needs at secondary and higher education levels. The need therefore arises to diversify
participation in the financing and provision of education at these levels, and the increase of beneficiary contributions particularly in

higher education where benefits are captured mainly by the beneficiaries (see Annex 4 for a discussion of the rationale for public
intervention in the education sector).
* Financing of specific investments vs. establishment of a Fund for higher education. The utilization of the scarce funding which
can be allocated to higher education under the Program can be maximized through an open, competitive and transparent process of
bidding. Additionally, with the experience obtained and the human resources trained under Japan PHRD Grant activities (1994-
1997), the capacity is now available for the higher education sub-sector to consider its own policy options and to make its own
decisions with regard to priorities for financing.
* Uniform vs. differentiated design, materials and techniques of construction of schools. The debate during preparation included
advocates of a centralized, uniform approach to the design and construction of primary schools, particularly in view of the fact that
certain areas of the country are regularly prone to cyclone damage. Based on evaluated experience under PRAGAP, UNICEF, FID,
however, the weight of opinion was that a more localized environmentally-sensitive and economical approach which included a high
level of community participation was a more effective way of achieving universal primary education within the envisaged budgets,
albeit one which allows for construction of substantial school buildings in cyclone-prone areas.
* Selective coverage of quality buildings in each district vs. universal coverage with limited funds. The debate on this issue centered
around the provision of two or three high quality model schools in each sub-district, probably fairly close to access roads, or full
coverage of more modest school constructions which would assist the Government in achieving its goal of universal primary
education by year 2010. The first option would defer the achievement of universal primary education, thus reduce equity of access
and substantially increase the cost.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
* Experience at local level in previous projects, especially under PRAGAP (see Annex I 1), helped formulate national policies.
* Local communities, when given the initiative and modest resources, can effectively identify their own priorities, deliver a quality
primary education which is sustainable, and increase their participation in the development process.
* Participatory approaches at all levels have proved an effective instrument for project planning and implementation, as well as an
instrument of learning from experience. Development of social capital at national and local levels, formation of teams, continuity
and cross-fertilization between regions and localities are additional benefits which accrue from the participatory approaches adopted.
* Experience under the on-going CRESED supports the need for a gradualist (planned and phased) approach to the devolution of
responsibility and resources to the local level, accompanied by appropriate capacity building measures (e.g. pre-contract workshops,
dialogue with community representatives and school teachers, training for acceptance of financial responsibility, managing financial
resources).
. The Training Fund financed under the IDA-financed PREFIEC project (Cr. 2382-MAG) and activities conducted under a Japan
Human Resources Development Grant provided a proving ground for testing a "fund" approach to the financing of educational
provision in higher education. Key results include: (a) targeting of funds to specific activities which are justified under the project
scope; (b) development of institutional capacity, e.g. mastering new skills in appraising proposals, negotiating contracts, setting
measurable performance indicators, monitoring progress and evaluating outcomes; and (c) accountability and transparency in the use
of public resources.
* The need for a diversity of specific initiatives to address the problem of the maldistribution and underemployment of teaching and
other staff.
* Importance of Government coordination of donor responses to its program.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
* The Government has shown its commitment through the preparation of sub-sectoral plans and an integrated national Master plan
for the development of education and training, as well as the formation of an inter-ministerial coordinating committee and an inter-
sectoral working group which have agreed priorities for the government's program. At Government initiative, meetings of all donors
active in the sector were called by the three ministries (MINESEB, MINESUP and METFP) in April and July 1997 to ensure support
for the Government' s program and facilitate the coordination of financial inputs. Such meetings are planned to occur regularly.
* In its work with the Bank, in the implementation of PRAGAP and in its work in similar projects with other donors (UNICEF,
Aide etAction), Governnent has shown its conunitment to devolution of responsibilities to the local level.
* A review of current projects in education and training shows satisfactory management and availability of counterpart funding.

* In higher education, the Government has been willing to undertake politically difficult and sensitive decisions since 1992 as well
as to maintain a consistent and developmental approach to planning for the sub-sector. For example, the "assainissemenr of all
campuses including the expulsion of squatters from university campuses, leading to the return of normal functioning in the
universities; delegation of greater academic autonomy to the universities and within the universities with the establishment of
independent Councils for each university, and Boards at Faculty and Departmental levels; substantial reduction of student numbers
(from over 44,000 in 1992 to about 18,000 in 1997); introduction of selection for entry for all subjects; rationalization and devolution
of budgetary responsibility, including the introduction of budgetary norms and cost centers in each university, as well as movements
toward the introduction of contract programs.
* A stable approach to policy development has been maintained despite changes in Govermnent and administrative responsibility.
12. Value added of Bank support:
* The Bank has been the lead donor in Madagascar in supporting the development of policy in education and training, and has been
instrumental in the preparation of sub-sectoral and integrated sectoral master plans drawing lessons from experience (for example in
PRAGAP), as well as in encouraging donor coordination and exchange of informnation.
a The Bank will continue to bring its macroeconomic and decentralization-related policy dialogue to bear on education sector issues,
particularly with regard to community involvement, encouragement of the private sector and public expenditure.
e The Bank will seek to coordinate this project more closely with cognate projects in the sector, as well as in other sectors such as
nutrition, health, water and sanitation, and social funds.
* With Bank support, the Govemrnent will deepen its expertise in program monitoring and evaluation.
* Equity issues will continue to be at the center of the policy dialogue between the Bank and Government, and with other donors.

(see Annex 4):                                                               Analysis:
This project supports Madagascar's education sector-wide program, for which a cost-benefit analysis is not informative (see draft
paper on Sector Investment Programs: An Update, produced by KNIT, Africa Region, and dated May 19, 1997). On the other hand,
the program's focus on primary education is shown to be economically rational from an examination of social rates of return by
education level (see Annex 4).
An equity analysis was carried out which indicated the following: (a) increases in primary level enrollments and unit cost are equity-
improving; (b) regional disparities in enrollments cannot be attributed to an unequal distribution of public education sector resources,
but to an unequal effectiveness of utilization of these subsidies; (c) there is a highly biased distribution of subsidies at secondary level
in favor of urban areas; and (d) targeting by gender is not equity-improving at any education level.
14. Financial Assessment:                     NPV=US$ N/A       million; FRR= N/A
Incremental recurrent costs associated with the Program remain within the budgetary envelope that is likely to be made available to
the sector under realistic assumptions of GNP growth and allocations to the education sector. Sustainability can be achieved under
the core case scenario provided that program costs are closely monitored. (See Annex 4 for a detailed discussion of the financial
impact of the Program). Agreements reached during the recently completed (November 1997) Public Expenditure Review, include:
* the incorporation of all projected investments (on-going as well as proposed investment projects) within the framework of the
Program;
* an increase in .the share of public resources to the education sector, from 1.5% of GDP in FY997 to 1.8% in 1998, which is
expected to be followed by a gradual increase to 2.0% by the year 2000;
* within the proposed budget for education, an increase in the share of public resources allocated to primary education (from 38.8%
of all non-salary recurrent expenditure to primary and secondary education in FYI 997 to 40.6% in FYI998), while at the same time
maintaining the current non-salary budget for higher education to its FY1997 level (thus reducing its share within the sector from
44.9%/o in FY1997 to 44.1% in FY1998);
* within the proposed budget for non-salary expenditure for primary and secondary education, a reallocation of expenditure from
central and regional administration to operating expenditure at the primary school level. For example, the amount of direct transfers
to primary schools would increase ftom FMG 5.6 billion in FY1997 (or 14% of the FMG 39.8 billion non-salary budget) to FMG 24
billion in FY1998 (or 44% of the budgeted FMG 54 billion). These additional resources would be earmarked for provision of school
implements to pupils and staff (exercise books, pens, chalk), school-level administrative expenditure (e.g. student and staff records),
replacement of essential furniture (benches), and maintenance of physical facilities;
* a series of measures to ensure timely availability of financial resources (earlier in the fiscal year) and to improve the rate of
disbursements (historically, more than 95% of budget was spent compared to an estimated 70-80% in FY1997 which is due to recent
decisions to decentralize commitment authority to local level that has led to delays in committing budgetary resources); and

a a strict application of budget procedures in higher education in order to avoid over-spending (public higher education institutions
have committed an amount of FMG 8.5 billion in FY1996 over the allocated budget) and a series of measures to stop accumulation
and absorb past arrears (estimated at about FMG 27 billion over the period 1992-93 to 1995-96) over a period of 3 years.
15. Technical Assessment:
The Project design for the three principal components -- primary education (US$37 million), textbooks and teaching-learning
materials (US$14 million) and higher education (US$5 million) -- has been piloted successfully under the on-going education
project, and are technically sound. Those aspects of the project that are innovative -- secondary education (US$3.5 million) will first
be tested for design robustness in a limited number of conumunities. Targeting is based on a systematic analysis of disparities and of
their causes (see Annex 4).
16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies: established in 1990, the project implementation unit (BPE) has been the main executing agency
responsible for the implementation of CRESED. Following a slow start, the BPE has gained experience and confidence in managing
complex procurement operations (such as procurement and distribution of 2.7 million textbooks to 11,500 primary schools), liaising
effectively with line staff at central, regional and district levels, and delivering support services (equipping services, training staff,
monitoring implementation, and reporting) to MINESEB and MINESUP. In order to meet efficiently the challenges of the proposed
sector investment program, the role, structure and management systems of the Project Management Unit (PMU) will be reviewed and
strengthened with a view to: (a) develop an effective planning and monitoring system at all levels which will ensure timely delivery
of information on the program, collection of data, processing of information and dissemination to line ministries and donors.
Experience gamed under PRAGAP form the basis of the new system detailed in the Implementation Manual; (b) assist staff in
regional, district and sub-district offices in sharing common understanding of the system, developing the necessary skills to use and
evolve within the system, strengthening decision-making skills and processes at all levels, and participating in all phases of the
implementation program; and (c) analyze, package and disseminate in a timely manner information generated by the monitoring
system, and following-up on actions to be taken. In addition, specialized agencies and consultants would be recruited to assist the
PMU in managing large procurement contracts, top supervision of civil works, accounting and auditing of program and project
accounts. High staff turnover at key managerial positions in MINESEB, especially Directors at central and regional levels, and
District Officers, has been an issue in recent years, in large part related to frequent changes in government and political leaders.
While it is reasonable to expect changes in managerial positions in the future, disruptions will be minimized by the establishment of
core groups of technical staff who generally demonstrate a solid experience in their milieu, high level of professional and personal
commitment, and higher level of stability in the job. To ensure continuity and benefit fully from investments in human resource
development, participation to staff development programs would be conditioned upon a cormitment of individuals and their
supervisors to remain in their position for at least two years after completion of the training.
b. Project management: at local level, experience gained under PRAGAP shows that management capacity had to be developed
first at regional level (DIRESEB, or Provincial Directorate of National Education) before it could be delegated to district level
(CiSco, or District Office for Education). In the 20 pilot districts where PRAGAP has been implemented since 1994, it is now clear
that the actual day-to-day management of the conunuity-based development process has to be delegated to the sub-district level
(ZAP, or Local Administrative Zone which groups an average of 10 primary schools), supported by appropriate technical specialists
from the District Office. On-the-job training will continue to be the main vehicle for developing skills in the areas of information,
education and communication (IEC) activities to local communities, assisting local authorities in establishing a School Council and
preparing a school-based project, providing the necessary support and inputs to the implementation of the sub-project, monitoring
progress and participating in evaluation of activities. At central level, the Program will support development of core skills in two
ways: (a) contracting out specialized services to the private sector in the areas of engineering, construction management and
supervision, delivery of equipment and goods to the schools, accounting, auditing, impact evaluation and beneficiary assessments;
and (b) strengthening core skills of technical staff in implementing agencies in the areas of program monitoring, project
management, and maintenance of management information systems.
17. Social Assmment:
Beneficiary assessments carried out under the on-going education project indicate that communities are willing to incur the necessary
costs to send their children to school and to participate in school rehabilitation. A number of communities overshot the objectives of
their school projects by constructing additional classrooms to accommodate increase in enrollments.
18 Environmental Assessment:         Environmental Category I I  A    [ I  B      [XI  C
The environmental impact of the proposed project is likely to be neutral. There would be environmental disruption associated with
the construction of small primary and lower secondary schools. However, the project would improve the sanitary environment of
about 7,000 existing schools, which lack basic sanitary facilities, and provide such basic facilities for all new construction. The

20. Sustainability:
. The project's strong commitment to community involvement in the planning, implementation and evaluation of their own provision
should ensure long term viability and sustainability.
* The budgetary approach adopted ensures that investment plans, as well as incremental recurrent expenditures generated by these
investments, are compatible with resources likely to be made available over the next five years and upon completion of the five-year
program. (See Annex 4 for a detailed discussion of the sustainability of the Program).
. Production and ownership by Government and educational institutions of their own program is likely to evoke greater comniitment,
effectiveness and sustainability.
* Cost sharing schemes in higher education imply a high level of commitment on the part of stakeholders.

* Privatization of services in higher education and the greater involvement of the private sector in secondary and higher education
provision could be controversial 121. Government proposes to adopt a gradualist approach, piloting first in one or two institutions, as
well as instituting support for private establishments, monitoring the results as it proceeds and feeding those into future policy
formulation. Bank assistance and support in this process will be critical to the successful implementation of the overall policy.
. The proposed measures to budget for a staffing establishment in each institution could be controversial for teachers [2]. An array
of alternative approaches and availability of incentives to teachers to redeploy or take early retirement should help to deflect possible
adverse reactions.
* Introduction of greater cost-recovery in higher education may be controversial because it will affect predominantly politically
influential high income groups 131. The Goverment's Master Plan proposes a gradual increase in beneficiary contributions and the
linking of scholarships to student achievement.
* Changes in the workload of teachers in higher education and tying payment to hours taught in secondary education could be
resisted by professional associations [2]. Future salary increases negotiated by Government would be linked to gradual changes in
conditions of service at both levels.
Note: Ratings of the degree of potential controversy range from low [11 to high [5]

Detailed Program and Project Description
Introduction
1.    The proposed Program is aimed at producing cost-effectively the diverse human resources
which are necessary for economic, social and cultural development by improving access to,
efficiency and quality of education. Drawing on the results of the implementation of the first
phase of the national Program (PNAE I) initiated in 1989, the proposed Program -- PNAE II --
aims specifically at achieving three objectives:
(a) to enable every child to have access to a primary education of quality which offers a firm
basis of learning in language, mathematics and the social aspects of education (in short,
reading, writing, arithmetic and the exercise of his/her role as a citizen) in order that he or
she may fulfill his or her productive role in modem society;
(b) to improve quality of, and access to, secondary education, in particular in rural areas, in
order to allow deserving students to pursue their studies; and
(c) to support the reform of higher education which was begun in 1992 in assisting institutions
to modernize and to diversify their programs of education and training.
2.    The strategies proposed for the effective implementation of the Program are multiple, but
complementary. They are based on the conception of the institution as the central place in which
the improvement of the learning of the pupils and students takes place at all levels. They are
based on the critical role of the Heads of these institutions who, in close collaboration with
teachers, pupils, parents, and the surrounding community, have to assume responsibility for
achieving the goals which are set by the education system. They are expressive of political and
social choices which favor effectiveness, equity, partnership and transparency in the management
of public goods and services.  Finally, these strategies favor up-to-date access to, and
management of knowledge and know-how which will permit Madagascar to develop human
resources which are capable of confronting challenges of the 21st century.
3.    The Project would support achievement of these objectives through implementation of six
components:
(a) Component 1: Universalize quality primary education by supporting community- and
school-based projects aimed at improving access and learning outcomes in about 4,100
public schools (out of 12,500 nationwide);
(b) Component 2: Improve quality and access to secondary education, in particular in rural
areas, through support to school-based pilot programs in about 40 lower secondary
schools (CEG) and 10 upper secondary schools (Lycees) (out of 695 and 94 public
institutions nationwide, respectively);
(c) Component 3: Improve access to quality textbooks and teaching-learning materials to all
primary schools in the country;

(d) Component 4: Support institutional development for key functions in the Ministry of
Secondary and Primary Education (M4NESEB) at central and deconcentrated levels;
(e) Component 5: Support reform of higher education in assisting institutions to modernize
and diversify through financing of sub-projects under a Fund for the Development of
Higher Education (FDES); and
(f) Component 6: Support project management at central, provincial / regional and local
levels.
First Component: Universalize Quality Primary Education (Total Program Cost Estimated
at US$100.0 million. Total ]DA Financing: US$ 37.0 million)
4.    With the aim of securing in the long term universal access to primary education, the
Program would support IMlNESEB-community collaboration strategies which have been
developed and tested since 1994 (see Annex 11 for a detailed description of these strategies).
This component supports the Government's goals to: (a) recruit and deploy teachers in sufficient
number, especially in rural primary schools; (b) increase awareness of communities toward the
school-based approach; (c) develop partnership between teachers, administrators and
representatives of the local communities to prepare and implement school-based sub-projects; (d)
improve availability and use of textbooks and other educational materials; (e) improve teaching-
learning methods and classroom management; (f) strengthen district management and delivery of
administrative and professional services to schools and teachers; and (g) provide adequate
infrastructure and equipment to primary schools.
A. The Deployment of Effective Heads and Teachers
5.    Studies conducted by the Ministry of Education since 1993, as well as the experience of
PRAGAP, demonstrate the crucial importance of the Head Teacher in the process of improving
education.  In effect, it is the primary school Head Teacher who assumes the primary
responsibility for assuring the effective participation of the community in the school project, for
the training of teachers and for the supervision of their work as well as for the effective presence
of both staff and pupils at school, for transmitting to the Ministry of Secondary and Basic
Education (MINESEB) the specific needs of the school (textbooks, equipment and furniture, etc.)
and for managing the school. In sum, the Head Teacher provides the personality of the school
and vitalizes the school project in partnership with the community.
6.    The teachers have the premier responsibility for the learning of the pupils at school. This
responsibility requires them to be available for the pupils, i.e. to teach effectively 160 days a year,
to demonstrate their ability to work with children, to give manifest of their moral and social
probity, to show that they themselves wish to learn, to train and to improve their teaching
competence throughout their professional career.
7.    The vast majority of primary school teachers (82 percent) actually in the public primary
schools do have the required profile defined by MINESEB. However, qualified candidates are
not motivated to remain deployed in rural areas that are distant from urban centers.



Project Appraisal Document                                                    Annex 2
Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                              Page 3
8.    In order to ensure the effective presence of competent heads and teachers the MINESEB
intends to implement a multi-faceted strategy which will influence both the process of recruitment
and deployment of teachers, as well as their professional development and career management.
This strategy takes account of the constraints on deployment, particularly in remote rural areas,
the present limits on the initial training of teachers, the perspective of the decentralization of the
management and administration of schools, and of a pragmatic approach to the professional
development of teachers and heads.
9.    In the perspective of decentralization, administrative responsibility for the recruitment and
deployment of teachers is devolved to the authorities at school district and commune levels. This
important change underlines the stated intention of Government to make the local authorities
accountable in the context of the "communal" or village school. In practice this implies that new
recruits are identified, chosen and deployed by the authorities at school district level (CiSco) in
close collaboration with the Heads of schools -- a devolution of responsibility which has both
advantages and disadvantages.
10.   This formula has the advantage of enabling local authorities to ensure that primary school
teachers are both appropriate and available to work in their district. As a consequence the
formula is conducive to the stabilization of personnel in their posts. Linked with a new approach
to management by institutional establishment -- under which each school is allocated a number of
posts corresponding to the norms laid down by the school-mapping exercise -- this practice
affords the opportunity to manage educational personnel more efficiently and transparently.
11.   On the other hand, this new formula also encounters practical difficulties. For, contrary to
the system which has prevailed for the past 20 years, teachers would no longer enjoy the
privileges of security of employment and of automatic redeployment in cases provided for in the
current civil service regulations (for example, in cases of social need, ill-health and reunification of
spouses). The decentralization of responsibility for recruitment also risks encouraging nepotism
at local level. Moreover, remote areas far away from centers, where initial training is offered,
may be disadvantaged in recruitment of newly trained teachers, given that the natural tendency is
to accept deployment in the urban areas.
12.   In order to minimize such risks, the MINESEB intends to adopt a series of measures
which will permit the reinforcement of the positive aspects of decentralization, while at the same
time assuring an equitable distribution of qualified personnel between urban and rural areas and
investing in the professional development of teachers at all stages of their careers. These
measures include:
(a) the involvement of the school district in the recruitment of pupil-teachers: thus, each
school district within a region or province, where there is a primary teacher training
college will be able to recruit and recommend a limited number of candidates, who while
corresponding to the required profile, will be able to register in the institutions of initial
training, on the understanding that the student who completes his or her studies
successfully shall serve for a minimum of three years in the school district of recruitment;



Project Appraisal Document                                                 Annex 2
Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                           Page 4
(b) the definition and implementation of profiles of recruitment and of methods of selection of
the candidates, as well as the inception of a probationary period of two years for all new
recruits. Newly appointed teachers would be twinned with a teacher who already has
substantial experience and their performance would be evaluated by a committee
comprising the Head of the school to which the teachers is deployed, the Chief Officer of
the sub-district office (ZAP) and the education advisor ("conseiller pedagogique") from
the same zone;
(c) the statutory requirement of each new entrant, regardless of his/her age or level of
recruitment, to work for three years in a rural area where at least two experienced
teachers are already in post in the school or in the immediate vicinity; and
(d) the introduction of methods of education and training on a continuous basis, including the
possibility of completing secondary or higher level studies by correspondence and above
all new programs of training and professional development which are adapted to the needs
of teachers.
B. School-based Projects
13.   The IDA Credit would support this objective through a sub-program (total estimated cost
of US$37.0 million) aimed at financing school-based projects to improve participation in quality
primary education especially in rural areas. Related components (provision of textbooks and
teaching-learning materials, and strengthening of key institutional functions within MINESEB) are
described in other sections of this annex.
14.   Drawing on the experience gained under PRAGAP and other programs initiated in 1994,
the Program will support school-based projects. The process comprises the following activities:
(a) IEC campaigns for village communities where there is a public primary school;
(b) the preparation of a school-based contract (Fanakena) which will define, starting with an
analysis of the needs of the community and the school, the objectives which have been
decided on for the school year, the responsibilities of each partner, the principal activities,
a calendar for their achievement, the cost and the sources of financing;
(c) the implementation of actions which the partners to the school contract are committed
(including the community, the Head Teacher and the teachers, the parents, and the
MNIIESEB;
(d) the continuation of the achievement of the school contract in the context of regular visits
by the local and regional authorities; and
(e) joint evaluation of the results achieved and the impact of the Program followed by the
preparation of a new school contract for the following school year.
15.  In the course of the first year of implementation of school-based projects in a school
district (the initial phase), experience has shown that the school contract supports in priority the
deployment of sufficient staff to the school and the rehabilitation of the school. Thus, with the



Project Appraisal Document                                                   Annex 2
Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                             Page 5
aim of regaining the confidence of parents and of local authorities vis-a-vis MINESEB and to
create mininal conditions necessary for success, it is crucial to ensure the effective presence of a
Head Teacher who is accepted by the community, of teachers who are competent and available to
teach, and of an adequate educational environment, i.e. one or more classrooms which respond to
the needs of the community, cupboards for storage and desks for pupils, educational materials in
sufficient quantities, and an appropriate school site with hedges, gardens, playground, etc.
16.   The process and the modalities for the implementation of the school-based projects are
described in an Implementation Manual which was put together based on experiences conducted
since 1994 (see Annex 11 for an account of these experiences). The first responsibility for this
implementation belongs to the School Council ("Conseil d'ecole") and the Head Teacher who
commit themselves through the contract to achieve the activities which have been set out in the
school project. The school and the village community are supported by the sub-district ZAP
Officers who are each responsible for the educational and administrative training of approximately
10 primary schools on average, situated within a reasonable distance of a village or major
habitation in the district. The services of facilitation and supervision of the school contract are
secured by sub-district Officer (ZAP) and the District Officers (CiSco). The School District
Officer calls on and coordinates the activities of a team of specialized professionals in the field of
primary education, educational planning, financing and management, resource management and
professional training. The team from the school district and the ZAP Officers in their turn call as
necessary on the resources of MINESEB for specialized services such as school and
administrative inspections, initial or in-service training of teachers, professional development of
teachers, financial services, statistical and school mapping services, curricula, studies and
evaluation.
17.   The approach is focused on the individual needs of each school, differentiated and unique
to each institution. Thus, the choice of the factors arises from an analysis of the needs of the
school community, which determines, through a series of workshops, the priority factors which
are to be addressed in any given period, usually lasting one school year. It is thus the prerogative
of the school partners -- the Head Teacher, the teachers, the parents of the pupils, the village
community, the authorities and the services of the Ministry of Education -- to define in
operational terms the factors which will be the object of specific interventions.
18.   The experience of such workshops already organized under PRAGAP indicates that each
school has specific needs and that the school partners express these needs in their own terms. The
workshops also permit them to choose from the factors considered those which in their view are
priorities; their number is consequently limited to three or four. Nevertheless, these factors tend
to cross-check with each other and there is a similarity among schools. The following examples
are illustrative of the visits and experiences of the last few years:
(a) the familiarization of teachers with new curricula prepared by the Ministry of Education;
(b) the utilization in the teaching situation of school texts and educational support materials
proposed in the syllabus;
(c) the preparation of lessons and practical exercises on the basis of modules and learning
guides contained in the new teaching programs;



Project Appraisal Document                                                  Annex 2
Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                           Page 6
(d) the management of time in a classroom, in particular the organization of lessons, small
group work, correction of exercises or of work done in school or at home;
(e) learning of reading and writing in Malagasy in the initial classes of primary school;
(f) the learning of a second language, French, in the middle and final years of primary school;
(g) the preparation of tests and other tools to measure the learning of the pupils and their
utilization to reinforce learning, to correct errors and to improve the performance of
pupils;
(h) the preparation and conduct of school activities of collaboration with the Ministry of
Public Health on subjects such as hygiene, vaccination, drinking water, nutrition, etc.; and
(i) the preparation and conduct of school activities in collaboration with representatives of
the National Office for the Environment on subjects such as the protection of the
environment, forestry resources, water, etc.
19.   The Program will support, to the extent of the resources available at local and regional
levels, the achievement of the objectives specified in the school contract for the provision of
goods and services which are required: educational materials, equipment, services of information
and training, regular visits by educational advisors, working and evaluation meetings.
20.   The Project would finance school-based projects and the provision of quality inputs to
primary schools in about 4,100 public primary schools (out of a total of about 12,500 nationwide)
in about 41 of 112 districts (CiSco) of the six provinces (DIRESEB) of Madagascar. The
remaining schools and CiScos would be supported by projects which are being prepared by
Government in close collaboration with donors, including UNICEF, OPEC, the African
Development Bank, and the European Union. A typical package of quality inputs would
comprise: (a) delivery of textbooks and teaching-learning materials to public primary schools; (b)
provision of basic management tools for Head Teachers and in-service training; (c) professional
development activities for Head Teachers and teachers, including tailored in-service programs,
regular visits of supervision, documentation and dissemination of best practices, and coaching by
experienced teachers and pedagogical advisors; and (d) conduct of bi-annual national learning
assessments, starting in 1999 with a view to assess changes in actual learning in the core subjects.
21.   At the completion of the Project, the following results are expected:
(a) preparation, negotiation and implementation of school-based contracts which would be
implemented at the rate of 410 during the first year (e.g. 410 schools in 4 CiSco), 1,025 in
year 2 (including 615 new schools in 6 CiSco), 1,845 in year 3, 2,870 in year 4, and 4,100
in year 5;
(b) the ZAP Officer and staff from the CiSco would have visited each school under contract a
minimum of 4 times per year to monitor implementation of agreed upon activities specified
in the contract and to conduct an evaluation of impact;

Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                           Page 7
(c) financial contribution estimated at about US$500 per year for each school under contract
to support activities related to school management, professional development and in-
service training of teachers, changes in teaching methods in the classroom and other
support services offered by pedagogical advisors at the District level;
(d) the construction of about 1,415 classrooms and the rehabilitation of about 8,015
classrooms in 4,100 schools. The type of construction and materials used would be
adapted to local conditions according to available resources. It is expected that about
1,880 classrooms would be constructed or rehabilitated using modem techniques (e.g.
brick and mortar, corrugated steel roof), while approximately 4,720 classrooms would use
local materials (e.g. wood planks, mud walls, thatched roof) and the remaining 2,830
classrooms would use a mixed type of design; and
(e) all project-financed schools would be furnished with adequate black boards, storage
capacity and benches.
Component 2: Improve Access to Quality Secondary Education in Rural Areas (Total
Program Cost Estimated at US$27.5 million. Total IDA Financing: US$ 3.5
million)
22.   At secondary level, the objective of PNAE II consists principally in the improvement of
quality and of access, particularly in rural areas. The intended result is the improvement of
internal and external efficiency. This policy requires that in future efforts on the part of public
education will need to be more concentrated. A school map will be developed corresponding to
the needs of secondary education in the context of the existing financial constraints, which will
guide the MINESEB in its investments and in the distribution of resources.
23.   The Government proposes to undertake reform measures at secondary level whilst
increasing enrollment. It will undertake a campaign of information and sensitization for parents
and for the public at large. According to the state of the resources available to the year 2003, it is
envisaged that enrollment in lower secondary education will increase at a rate of 2 percent per
year, and that of upper secondary schools will increase at a rate of 1 percent per year. Two-thirds
of the lower secondary schools and one-third of upper secondary schools located in rural areas
which cover a third of students at the moment would be subject of modest investment in the first
instance.
24.   The development of secondary education will thus take place in stages in successive areas.
The choice of area and their prioritization will attack the problem of regional disparities. The
criteria for selection at the beginning of each stage of secondary education will be reviewed. It
will therefore be opportune to improve resources allocated to institutions for their functioning and
to improve administration. It will be necessary to: (a) suppress double shift working in lower
secondary education (15 percent of the classes are currently organized in this way); (b) increase
the size of classes (at the moment, class size is approximately 29 in lower secondary education
and 32 in upper secondary education); and (c) redeploy part of the educational personnel in upper
secondary education to lower secondary education, and part of the staff of lower secondary
education into primary education. This last measure is justified by the fact that workloads are



Project Appraisal Document                                                 Annex 2

very low -- about 15 hours a week in lower secondary school and 13 in upper secondary schools -
- and could improve the average level of qualification of teachers.
25.   Based on successful experiments conducted at primary level, the project will support
experimental school-based sub-projects prepared by a network of rural communities interested in
improving access and quality of secondary education. Using an approach similar to the one
developed for primary education, a School Council will be requested to prepare and submit a
school-based project which will be evaluated by a ad hoc committee in MINESEB. The project
will finance the necessary technical assistance and specialist services, construction / rehabilitation,
furniture, equipment, educational materials, training and staff development activities.
26.   Given the innovative character of this process at secondary level, characteristics of
secondary schools, and specific issues facing the sub-sector, the first phase of the program would
consist of an experiment in 4 lower secondary schools (CEG) and one upper secondary school
located in the four districts selected for school-based contracts under the first year of the Project.
In addition, the management of one of those four schools would be contracted out to the private
sector. An evaluation would take place at the end of year 1, and the results would guide the
process of extending the approach to an additional 45 schools during the remaining four years of
the Project.
27.   At the completion of the Project, the following results are expected:
(a) community- and school-based projects will be prepared, negotiated and implemented in 5
secondary schools located in rural areas. Those institutions will have been selected in the
four Districts chosen for implementation of the primary education component with the
view to ensure complementarity of approaches and synergy of local resources. A
comprehensive evaluation will be completed by the end of the first year, and the results
will be reviewed both by local and national authorities and the Bank prior to the extension
of the approach to an additional 45 schools;
(b) a detailed program will be prepared for the remaining four years of the Project before
September 1999; and
(c) monitoring and evaluation procedures will be implemented for the remaining contracts.
Component 3: Textbooks and Teaching-learning Materials (Total IIDA Financing: US$
14.0 million)
28.   Based on results achieved under the on-going CRESED project (Cr. 2094-MAG) which
include distribution of about 2.7 million textbooks at primary level (including 15 titles in Malagasy
language), and 0.5 million textbooks at lower secondary level, the objective of this component is
to consolidate and improve access to quality materials at primary level. The Project would
support the following objectives: (a) maintaining the current ratios of teacher guides:teacher at
primary level; (b) improve the textbook:pupil ratio to one book per pupil in all primary schools of
the country; (c) improve the distribution and monitoring of textbooks and teaching-learning

materials; and (d) strengthen in-service training and support services to teachers to improve
effectiveness in the use of materials. The IDA contribution is estimated at US$14.0 million.
29.   At the completion of the Project, the following results are expected:
(a) design, experiment and editing of 20 new titles (textbooks and corresponding teacher
guides);
(b) printing and delivery of about 7.2 million textbooks (including reprint of existing titles)
and 0.4 million teacher guides; and
(c) in-service training of teachers in using efficiently pedagogical materials in learning
situations in the classroom.
30.   Modalities for the production of new titles, the preparation of bidding documents, the
preparation of manuscripts, the experiment of new textbooks, their edition and the printing and
distribution of textbooks and teacher guides have been defined, and an operational plan has been
completed and appraised in July 1997.
Component 4: Institutional Development for Key Functions of the MINESEB (Total IDA
financing: US$3.0 million)
31.   The PNAE II is the product of a joint, collaborative effort of staff in the MIINESEB and
IvlNESUP, based on studies, experiments and results achieved under a vast number of initiatives
supported by the Government and donors. Since the early 1990's, main achievements include: a
major study on the management of MINESEB financed under the on-going CRESED (Cr. 2094-
MAG); training of inspectors, school supervisors and pedagogical advisors financed under the
French Cooperation PRESEM project; development of in-country capacity and training of staff in
school mapping and educational planning activities through a Bank-financed program
implemented by UNESCO and IIEP; experimentation and implementation of new forms of
collaboration between the school and the local communities supported by UNICEF, the Bank and
NGOs in the country; strengthening of personnel management functions (surveys, establishment
of a data base, rationalization in the deployment of staff) through project-financed activities under
PRESEM and CRESED; revision of the curriculum at primary and secondary levels, production
of textbooks and teaching-learning materials by UERP, an autonomous body established in 1990
in MINESEB with the assistance from the German Government and the Bank; the production of a
Master Plan for the development of higher education and the launching of quality assurance
systems supported initially by the CRESED and more recently by the Japan Government through
a PHRD Grant; and the production and dissemination of two specialized periodicals (one for
primary and one for secondary level) circulated to all teachers in Madagascar with the assistance
from the French Cooperation.
32.   These initiatives were designed and have contributed to strengthening the institutional
capacity in the ministries in charge of education at all levels of the hierarchy. However, the
experience gained in the preparation of PNAE II has demonstrated the need to consolidate and
extend these capacities beyond small groups of staff who have been involved at central level, to



Project Appraisal Document                                                 Annex 2

create a network between individuals and groups that have a natural tendency to work in isolation
from one another, and to engage in essential activities which have been neglected until now,
especially in the areas of learning assessment and program monitoring.  In addition, the
Government's goal to improve efficiency and accountability of public administration through
decentralization requires major changes in management practices, long-term investments in human
capital development and major enhancements in information processing and technologies to
support decision-making at regional and local levels.
33.   The Project will support institutional development activities at central and deconcentrated
(provincial/regional and local) levels aimed at supporting implementation of the Government's
Program, especially in key areas of monitoring and impact evaluation. Adopting similar contract-
based approaches, this component would finance specific, well-defined activities based on detailed
Terms of Reference in the areas of educational planning, personnel management, bi-annual
learning assessments at primary and secondary levels, networking of staff and institutions, and
pre-investment studies.
34.   At the completion of the Project, the following results are expected:
(a) production of an annual report on sub-programs aimed at improving quality of learning at
primary and secondary levels, which will be prepared by MINESEB and transmitted to the
Bank and other donors before end of June of each year. These reports will assess the
status of implementation of school-based contracts based on agreed upon performance
indicators, document issues and recommend corrective measures, propose a detailed
program for the next period (between 12 and 24 months), including cost estimates, work
program and budgetary resources (internal, as well as external) at each level of
management. Each report will be reviewed with the Bank and other donors in the sector
prior to their translation in the annual budget and public expenditure program;
(b) support to the planning services at central, regional and local (CiSco) levels for the
production of a school map, data collection, analysis and production of statistical reports,
and detailed analysis of performance indicators;
(c) support programs and activities aimed at decentralizing personnel management and
strengthening services at regional, district and local levels in the context of the Public
Service Reform;
(d) bi-annual national learning assessments at primary and secondary levels by year 2 and year
4 of the Project. Standard tests will be developed and random testing will be conducted
by teams of specialists in MINESEB. Results will be published and disseminated to
partners in the sector;
(e) workshops will be held each semester to review procedures adopted for the management
of school-based contracts, and to revise, as necessary, the Manual of Operations;

(f) networks will be established and professional exchanges will be conducted with countries
that have experimented similar approaches, including El Salvador, Columbia and Senegal;
and
(g) feasibility and pre-investment studies will be conducted to prepare future investments in
the sector.
Component 5: Support Reforms of Higher Education (Total Program Cost Estimated at
US$ 25.5 million. Total IIDA Financing: US$ 5.0 million)
35.   The inception of the policy of autonomy for public universities and the "assainissement"
of university campuses from 1992 onward, the creation of Higher Institutes of Technology (ISTs)
in 1991, the development of distance higher education from 1993, and the regrouping of a number
of service centers under the concept of a "Technopole" at the University of Toamasina in 1995
are examples of the courageous decisions and important innovations which have marked the
beginning of reform of higher education as part of the first national plan for education (PNAE I).
In addition and in parallel with these developments, an exercise of strategic reflection, of planning,
costing and development of new systems and approaches was conducted, which resulted in
January 1997 in the publication of the Master Plan for Higher Education. This Master Plan
defines two major policy orientations: modernization and diversification of the institutions of
higher education and their programs.
36.   The first of these, modernization of institutions and programs, is aimed at creating, by
means of new relationships between the partners involved, a system of higher education which
will contribute actively to the overall development aims set by the Government of Madagascar,
namely: to liberalize the economy, to open Madagascar to the world; to stimulate financial
participation on the part of all beneficiaries and to improve the utilization of scarce public
resources by gains in internal and external efficiency. Traditional higher education in the
Malagasy universities has not responded to the needs of an economy which is evolving in
response to the requirement for human resources which can sustain an economic development,
which includes opening up to world markets and to the globalization of economic exchange. The
Master Plan recognizes this gap and this challenge and it traces out important new policy
orientations, including:
(a) the re-examination by the traditional universities of their mission, their structure of
governance and the realignment of their management and financing with a new mission,
more supportive of the nation's development;
(b) the encouragement of the creation of private universities and institutions;
(c) the rapid and effective development by higher education institutions of short programs of
vocational orientation which respond more rapidly and closely to the needs of commercial
and industrial enterprises;
(d) the creation of institutional networks for research, for the application of new technologies,
for access to, and management of, knowledge and for its dissemination not only among
Malagasy universities and institutions of higher education themselves, but also urgently



Project Appraisal Document                                                   Annex 2
Madagscar - Education Sector Development Project                             Page 12
with partners from the economic sectors and with centers of excellence throughout the
world;
(e) support for the development at home and abroad of networks amongst the various
partners (professors, lecturers, researchers, employers, students, professionals and
technicians) to enrich the lives of institutions; and,
(f)  equipment of institutions with central administrations and management which.have the
necessary and effective tools to measure the internal and external efficiency of these
institutions and to regulate and adapt financial policies to support their development.
37.   In response the challenge of these new orientations, a range of policies, measures and
activities have already been put in place or are currently proposed. With the assistance of donors,
a range of new short cycle programs are presently in development in a number of institutions and
all institutions are in the process of aligning their development plans with the Master Plan. The
private sector of higher education is also developing rapidly with programs in particular in the
areas of business, information technology and social sciences. Distance higher education,
although recent, has experienced a rapid increase in programs and student numbers and models of
the open university are currently under study with the aim of serving a much larger number of
students at an improved unit cost, not least in remote areas, as well as to diversify,' the range of
programs and to respond to the need for continuous retraining at a distance via the media.
Regional initiatives such as the creation of the University of the Indian Ocean and joint programs
with other universities including La R6union are under active planning. New measures for the
accreditation of all programs and the evaluation of all institutions are currently being
implemented.
38.   Diversification of the institutions and their programs aims at creating favorable conditions
for the improvement of the quality of services provided, whether programs, consultancy or
research. The internal diversification of institutions presupposes that they are capable of creating
not only new programs or new educational strategies, but also that they assume the responsibility
to do so. For this goal, the institutions need to put in place: tools of statistical and financial
management which will permit the measurement of the real economic costs of educational
programs and of the quality of programs and services; policies for differentiated financing and
support for programs which respect nevertheless the criteria and overall orientation laid down by
Government. The diversification of programs implies the establishment of a rigorous process of
analysis of the needs for training and education expressed by the world of work and the
enlargement of the range of sources and methods for the dissemination of scientific knowledge
and techniques.
39.   The Master Plan recognizes these challenges and identifies a number of new orientations:
(a) the Ministry responsible for higher education should introduce in close collaboration with
the institutions, teachers and researchers, a system of institutional analysis and of
institutional and curricular quality assurance;
(b) the policy of institutional autonomy, begun in 1992, requires on the one hand transparent
and rigorous norms of administration and financial management, elaborated by the State



Project Appraisal Document                                                    Annex 2
Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                             Page 13
and applied to institutions of higher education, and on the other hand administrative
structures and institutional management systems which will guarantee transparency and
effectiveness;
(c) institutions should prepare and subject to the approval of their senate a tri-annual
development plan which will serve as a basis inter alia for the definition of finance
transferred from the State;
(d) the institutions should in the context of their development plan diversify their sources of
financing in order to gradually reduce the Government's proportion of the funding of their
services. Measures for cost recovery of social services will also be put in place as well as
developments in the privatization in the management of certain services, an increase in
direct beneficiary contributions, and award of scholarships to students on the basis of
educational merit; and
(e) institutions will be encouraged to adopt each at their own level policies for the admission
of students and for educational regulation concerning repetition and student pathways.
Measures to limit the number of new entrants (numerus clausus) to select students on the
basis of their files or competitive examination, the limitation of the number of repetitions
and to the maximum number of students in a Faculty, a Department or a Program have
already been implemented and achieved satisfactory results, for example in the case of the
Higher Institutes of Technology.
40.   The Project will support the inception of the above new orientations by means of the
creation of a Fund for the Development of Higher Education (FDES) which will be made
available to the ministry responsible for higher education and the public and private institutions of
higher education. FDES will be administered by a Council which will include representatives of
the universities, research institutes, private institutions, commercial and industrial interests, of the
Government and of distance education. The Council will be responsible for the approval of sub-
projects, for the monitoring of their achievement and for the evaluation of their impact. All public
and private institutions of higher education recognized by the ministry responsible for that sub-
sector will be eligible for finance and support from the FDES on condition that they present sub-
projects which respect the following objectives and criteria:
(a) the proposer of a sub-project will have to demonstrate that the sub-project is part of the
development plan of the institution and if it concerns a public institution, that this
development plan has been approved by the ministry responsible for higher education;
(b) the sub-project will have to be linked with or associated with institutions partners, for
example a University, institute, research center or scientific foundation which has its
principal place of business outside Madagascar;
(c) the proposer and the associated institutions will have to demonstrate the feasibility of the
sub-project;
(d) the proposer of a sub-project will have to demonstrate (i) the availability of internal
resources amounting to at least 25 percent of the total cost of the project for the first year
of its implementation; (ii) the availability of a contribution from associate institutions



Project Appraisal Document                                                    Annex 2
Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                             Page 14
amounting to at least 25 percent of the cost for the first year; and (iii) if there is scope, a
viable pluri-annual financing plan. In consequence, the FDES will not be able to provide
more than a maximum of 50 percent of the financing for the first year of implementation of
a sub-project;
(e) eligible sub-projects will be classified in one or several of the following three categories:
(i) a higher level training program offered full- or part-time in one or more of the
associated institutions, for example the Malagasy proposer and one of the other
institutions, or by distance methods; (ii) a piece of action research or of applied research;
and/or (iii) an operation which has the objective of institutional reinforcement, for example
the inception of an administrative structure or systems of management, the professional
development of university teachers or institutional research, the establishment of a
network of scientific exchanges, either technical or cultural, etc.;
(f) a training sub-project should permit the organization in the first year of its implementation
of learning and training activities which will take place in Madagascar or abroad in
association with institutional partners;
(g) such training will need to be approved in part or in whole and on a joint basis with the
institutional partners, and all institutions concerned will need to be involved in either a part
of or the whole of the examination of the work of the students;
(h) a sub-project which involves action research will have to associate, in addition to the
international partners, public or private enterprises in Madagascar which are active in the
defined area; and
(i) a sub-project for institutional reinforcement will need to be able to benefit at least three
institutions of higher education in Madagascar, or preferably a national network of public
or private institutions in Madagascar, and the proposer should be able to give proof that
institutional agreements between the beneficiary institutions have been signed before the
submission of a sub-project to the Council of FDES.
41.   Procedures relative to such matters as the elaboration of a preparatory project, the criteria
for eligibility and financing, the approval of sub-projects and their monitoring, the mode of
financing and the control of expenditures financed by FDES, the monitoring and evaluation of
sub-projects, are detailed in the Manual of Procedures of FDES.
42.   At the completion of the Project, the following results are expected:
(a) about 20 pre-projects (for which participation of the FDES is limited to a maximum of
US$20.000) and about 50 sub-projects (for which participation of the FDES is limited to a
maximum of US$100.000) will be implemented;
(b) partnerships will be negotiated and signed between malagasy and foreign institutions of
higher education for the implementation of these sub-projects; and,
(c) the Council, the General Assembly, the FDES and a Panel of international experts will be
operational, and complementary sources of finance and partnerships will be investigated.

Component 6: Support to project management (Total IDA Financing: US$2.5 million)
43.   To ensure effective and efficient management of the project-financed activities in support
of the PNAE II, a small Project Management Unit (PMU) will be established. The PMU will
comprise a General Coordinator, assisted by Heads of Components -- Primary, Secondary and
FDES, represented by its Executive Secretary -- recruited and hired by Government under the
authority of the two Ministers in charge of primary and secondary education, and, higher
education. In addition, the PMU will recruit two specialists: one in charge of project accounting,
and one in charge of procurement operations. Detailed Terms of Reference have been prepared
for each of these positions.
44.   The PMU will coordinate implementation of project-financed activities with line managers
and staff at all levels of MINESEB and MINESUP who will be responsible for actual
implementation of contracts and project-financed activities.  At central level, Heads of
components will liaise with staff in the Directorates of the Ministries to ensure that agreed upon
goals, strategies and action plans are understood and shared fully, and that detailed activities
financed under the IDA Credit and other donors involved in the sector are complementary and
efficiently implemented. At provincial and regional levels, the PMU will liaise with the Directors
and their staff to disseminate information on the Program and the Project, collect and analyze
relevant information, process decisions, monitor implementation and evaluate results. At local
level, the PMU will organize training on implementation procedures for staff in the CiSco (Head
of the CiSco, assistants, pedagogical advisors, and Heads of the sub-districts or Chefs ZAP),
facilitate management, monitor progress and evaluate results.
45.   Production and dissemination of information, experiences and knowledge will be built
around networks of managers and staff through publication and dissemination of good practices,
exchange programs and professional development activities in Madagascar and abroad.
Beneficiary assessments, joint annual evaluations, learning assessments and mid-term review will
be conducted under the overall coordination of the PMU, and results will be disseminated with the
view to inform decision, take appropriate corrective measures, and revise and improve the Manual
of Operations for the Project at primary and secondary level and the Manual of Procedures of the
FDES.
46.   Also, the PMU will participate in the overall coordination of the PNAE II by providing
detailed quarterly reports, exchanging views and participating in decisions in coliaboration with
the Program Coordinator and the inter-ministerial working group.

Economic Analysis
This annex addresses two important economic issues: (a) the rationale for public
involvement in the education sector through both its efficiency and its equity dimensions; and (b)
the financial sustainability of the proposed program.
1.    Public Involvement in the Education Sector
Public resources are optimally used in the education sector when their level and
distribution within the sector are such that they contribute most efficiently to economic growth
(efficiency) and to poverty reduction (equity). Section A, below, discusses the issue of
efficiency and its implications for education sector budget allocations in Madagascar. Section B
discusses equity issues and ensuing targeting recommendations for the education sector
investment program.
A.    Efficiency
A.1   A critical discussion of the theory
Efficiency has long been taken to mean that a productive project or program should
exhibit high social returns to investment. Table 1 below shows rates of return by education level
for Madagascar and for sub-Saharan Africa. In the literature, they appear as "social" rates of
return. However, insofar as they do not take externalities into account, they do not reflect fill
benefits to education. They are in effect closer to private rates of return with the difference that
costs here include those not directly incurred by the households.
Table 1: "Social" internal rates of return to education
"Social" internal rates of return  |  Primary       Secondary  l      iher |
Sub-Saharan Africa                      24%            18%           11%
Madagascar- public schools         r    21%            14%            6%
Madagascar - private schools            36%            16%            8%
From Rasera (1988) & Psacharopoulos (1994)
The pattern in Madagascar is similar to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa with rates of
return to primary education far exceeding those of secondary and tertiary education. The table
also suggests that, in Madagascar, public education at all levels is a lesser attractive option than
private education, and that returns to public education are consistently lower than the region-
wide average. These results must not be taken face value given the uncertain robustness of the
data utilized for these computations.
While it is clear that any investment program envisaged should demonstrate that the
associated benefits outweigh the costs, it is not necessary that it display high rates of return.
Indeed, if rates of return to a project are high, it could persuasively be argued that the proposed

Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                             Page 2
investment is crowding out a lucrative private endeavor. The rationale for investment of public
funds and the meaning of efficiency for the public sector are slightly different.
There are gains to public intervention in a sector when the pure market equilibrium is
sub-optimal from the perspective of society and when such an intervention corrects market
failures.  In the case of education, such market failures are typically in the form  of
"externalities." Households, left on their own, would invest in the education of their children to
the extent that their private benefits sufficiently exceed the costs they incur.  From the
perspective of society, however, the outcome of this system is unlikely to be optimal because
households do not take into account the public benefits from education (impact of education on
fertility, health, co-worker productivity, etc.). Returns computed from the perspective of
society would, in this case, exceed private returns, thereby warranting higher investment levels
than in the pure market situation. Some form of public intervention in the education sector is
therefore justified when social rates of return exceed private rates. The difficulty lies in
computing those social rates - valuing externalities having proved a near-impossible task. From
that perspective, table 1 above is only mildly interesting for the policy-maker.
Mingat and Tan (1996) have attempted to address this problem head-on and to capture
the externalities associated with different education levels or different groups of countries. Table
2 summarizes their findings which provide an economically sound basis for making policy
recommendations for public sector intervention.

Mingat & Tan (September 1996)
Madagascar belongs to the low-income category for which the social returns (i.e.,
inclusive of externalities) to primary education are very high and far exceed private rates of
return, suggesting that there are economic efficiency arguments for public intervention in this
sub-sector. Returns to post-primary levels of education, on the contrary, are lower than private
returns, suggesting that private sector involvement should be encouraged for efficiency reasons.
The policy implications from the discussion above are that the government should invest
in education because it is a high-yield investment, and particularly in primary education both
because is it- associated with substantial externalities and because it is the best means to enable
the poor to build their human capital.
A.2  Implicationsfor the allocation ofpublic resources in the education sector
This section examines whether the present patterns and levels of public spending in
Madagascar are consistent with the above recommendations. More specifically, it discusses

which budgetary reallocations would be advisable at various levels (inter-sectoral, intra-sectoral,
and within education sub-sectors) and whether they are realistic.
A. 2.1 Inter-sectoral allocations
Does the government of Madagascar spend enough in the education sector? Figures 2
and 3 below indicate relative spending in primary and secondary education in Madagascar.

Although they still compare favorably to the SSA average, allocations to the education
sector as a percentage of total spending' are at decade low. There is some room therefore to
modify the inter-sectoral allocation of public resources in favor of the education sector2.
Education sector public expenditure represented 17.2 percent of public spending including debt service in
1997. The average for SSA stands at 15 percent.
2   This recommendation is consistent with the CAS: "reallocations will aim to increase oudays on basic
health, primary education, key rural infrastmcture and public security." (page 7)

Maldagascar - Education Sector Development Project                               Page 4
While Madagascar still allocates a reasonable share of its total public spending to the
education sector, the absolute level of spending in the sector is clearly insufficient. For the sake
of comparison, public spending in the education sector was 1.5% of GDP in Madagascar in
1997, compared to an average for sub-Saharan Africa of 3.6% of GDP. This is ultimately an
issue of increasing public revenues and is discussed in the CAS3 which recommends an increase
in tax revenue to 11% of GDP by 1999 from its current level of 9% of GDP. The CAS also
suggests that sustained growth would allow public spending in the education sector to reach the
desired 3.5% of GDP in the medium-term. In the short-term, the government4 aims to raise
recurrent spending in the education sector to 2% of GDP by the year 2000.
A.2.2 Intra-sectoral budgetallocations
The above section established that there is some latitude to increase the education budget
by increasing the share of education as a percentage of total spending. This does not ensure that
primary education is and will be adequately funded. This section discusses the desirability and
feasibility of resource reallocations between education sub-sectors. Figures 4 and 5 below,
show allocations of public resources by education level in 19965.

It is clear from the above two figures that the bulk of the education sector budget
does go to primary and secondary education. However, reallocations away from technical
and vocational and higher education and into primary and secondary could be necessary
and could be feasible. It is also clear from the above figures that allocations to the primary
and secondary levels are essentially for the payment of teachers. Figure 6 below shows this
more explicitly.
3   Country Assistance Strategy, Report No. 16249-MAG, Jan. 1997.
4   As expressed in the 'Document Cadre de Politique Econoniique'.
5 Public spending data could not be obtained in a disaggregated form for primary and secondary levels. For
the sake of illustration, in the Republic of Korea, the breakdown for public spending in education is: 44%
for the primary level, 34% for the secondary level, 7%/. for the tertiary level, and 15% for administation.

The share of the primary education budget that is spent on quality inputs is
therefore minimal. There might be a strong case for reallocating some of the salary and
non-salary budget from higher education to primary education, in particular, in view of the
fact that (a) that the non-salary university budget includes unsustainable fellowship and
scholarship allowances; and (b) that a number of services could be privatized, and that
beneficiary contribution increased at university level6.
The implications from the above discussion for the sector investment program can
be summarized as follows: (a) it is quite realistic to assume that the education sector
budget will increase to 2 percent of GDP by the year 2000; indeed, the education sector
budget as a percentage of total spending is at a historical low, and there is scope for some
inter-sectoral reallocations towards education; (b) there is room for further reallocations
within the education sector, away from university subsidies and grants and into quality
inputs for primary education.
The implication for tertiary level institutions is that they will have to move quickly
to near financial autonomy. The proposed Fund for the Development of Higher Education
(FDES) is intended to help overhaul the system to one that is leaner, more autonomous, of
higher quality, and more attentive to external efficiency. The FDES is not expected to
crowd out private investment in the sub-sector since private tertiary institutions will be
able to compete for funding. In addition, one of the expected benefits of the FDES is to
modify institutional behavior towards public financing, making the system more responsive

There are other valid reasons why the public sector should want to intervene in the
education sector. The national economic strategy is one of pro-poor growth, and the
government is concerned with enabling the poor to participate in the growth process and
make use of the new employment opportunities. Education, and in particular primary
education, is a privileged instrument for helping the poor augment their human capital so
that they can partake of economic growth. It should be noted that while education is a
necessary condition for individuals from poor households to benefit from growth
opportunities, it is not a sufficient one: if there is little or no growth, it is likely that many
with an adequate level of education will remain poor.
This section examines some of the dimensions of equity and discusses which
modes of targeting (urban v/s rural, male v/s female, high v/s low incomes) would be the
most appropriate levers for reducing inequities in Madagascar.
RI   Equity ofpublic spending in education
This section looks at the distribution of cumulative spending in education. The
longer students stay in the education system, the more they cumulatively benefit from
public subsidies. A university student will already have cumulated public subsidies for the
duration of his/her primary and secondary schooling; a contrario, a child who has never
attended school will never have benefited from public spending in education. The graph
below is accordingly built on the basis of enrollments and estimated unit costs at each
education level.

The graph indicates that about 40% of the population has never benefited from
public subsidies in education leading to a very inequitable of distribution of public
resources allocated to the education sector, as indicated by a Gini coefficient of 0.74.

Increases in primary enrollments and in primary unit costs are both equity-improving, as

B.2   Income disparities
In view of Government's objective to promote pro-poor growth, it is important to
verify whether and to what extent income disparity is likely to be a source of inequitable
access to education. The Poverty Assessment for Madagascar7 shows quite clearly that
currently children from poor and rural households are far less likely to attend school than
their counterparts from richer urban households. Table 3 below summarizes the enrollment
situation as of 1994.

Because of low enrollments of children from poor rural households, the incidence
of public spending in education currently exhibits a heavy bias in favor of rich urban
households. The inequitable distribution of education subsidies is indicated in Figure 9
below8.

Quintiles
The large variation in the per capita subsidy for all education between urban and
rural areas is driven by the inequality in distribution of secondary-level and university-level
subsidy. Primary-level per capita subsidy in urban and rural areas are comparable.
Secondary-level per capita subsidy in urban areas is four times as high as that in rural
areas. This suggests that efforts need to be made to expand access and use of secondary
education in rural areas. Private provision of secondary and tertiary education would, on
the other hand, be most appropriate for rich urban areas. The Government of Madagascar
has indicated, particularly at tertiary level, its intention to solicit higher beneficiary
participation. The Master Plan for Higher Education9 supports a number of policy
measures that, in the short run, wili: (a) double enrollments in private tertiary institutions,
(b) double beneficiary contributions in public tertiary institutions; (c) privatize a variety of
services provided to student.
R3    Regional disparities
This section discusses whether targeting by province is appropriate and, in
particular, whether any one province should benefit from accrued public subsidies.
Figures lOa and lOb below show the relative enrollments status in 1995 in the six
provinces of Madagascar and for the primary and lower secondary levels.

Cumulative percentage of populaton
At primary level, Toliary and Fianarantsoa, and at secondary level, Mahajunga,
Toamasina and Fianarantsoa are under-represented, suggesting that some form of
targeting by province might be appropriate for either primary or secondary level, but not
for both levels together.
One potential reason for those regional disparities could be an unequal distribution
of per capita education subsidy.  Figure  1110 below  shows the current situation in
Madagascar.

Provinces
The per-capita subsidy for all education is about twice as high for Antananarivo
than for any other province, because university-level and, to a lesser extent, secondary-
level subsidies are biased towards the capital. The per capita subsidy at the primary level
is, however, more or less equally distributed among regions. It would seem that the
under-representation of Fianarantsoa and of Toliary at primary level, or of Mahajunga,
Fianarantsoa and Toamasina at secondary level are not because these provinces are
relatively underfunded, but to the fact that these subsidies are not being properly utilized"1.
The policy recommendation from this section would be to ensure the proper utilization of
existing subsidies at primary and secondary levels before increases are considered.
14    Gender disparities
Finally, there is the question of the appropriateness of targeting by gender. Figure
12 below, shows that there is no significant gender bias in primary schools in all of the six
provinces. The same applies at secondary and university levels, making Madagascar a
very atypical case in Africa.
These subsidies include salaries of the many teachers who are on the payrolls but do not teach in a
school. In the province of Fianarantsoa, over 700 schools have closed over the past few years so that
the subsidies, which are still being paid out, are grossly under-utilized.

level.
2.    Financial Sustainability of the Proposed Program
The proposed sector investment program needs to continue being adequately funded
beyond the program implementation period in order to ensure sustainability. Table 4 below is an
attempt at determining level of resources likely to be available to the education sector under a
series of assumptions. These assumptions are, for part, taken from the CAS and, for part, derived
from past trends.
Scenario 1 shown in Table 4 is based upon the following assumptions:
(a) GDP grows at the CAS high, base and core case rates;
(b) the share of the budget allocated to the education sector is made to increase to 2 percent
of GDP by the year 2000 and beyond;
(c) the share of each sub-sector is maintained in the same proportion as in the 1998 budget
(primary and secondary education at 83.6 percent, higher education at 12.4 percent, and
technical education at 4.0 percent of the education budget) throughout the life of the
program;
(d) the salary budget for primary and secondary education is driven by the recruitment of
1,000 additional teachers net every year and is indexed on inflation (assumed to be 4
percent throughout the period);
(e) the salary budget for technical and higher education is maintained at the 1998 level,
indexing for inflation; and
(f) the non-salary budgets for each education sub-sector are computed as residuals (expected
spending minus salary budget).

Table 6 below checks the Education Sector Development Program for realism
against the macroeconomic framework; i.e., it verifies whether the incremental recurrent
costs associated with the program added to the "without program" recurrent budget
remain within the expected envelopes for the sector assuming that the base case scenario
of Table 4 applies.

Table 6 indicates that if the base case of the scenario detailed in Table 4 applies, (i)
there would be no overall financial problems during the first four years of the program, but
that the recurrent budget might not be sufficient to maintain the investments in the sector
from the fifth year onwards; and (ii) that the particular scenario studied here is too
generous with salary allocations, but allocates insufficient funds to the non-salary budget.
Scenario 2 described below ensures that the program is globally sustainable, but
does involve proactive intervention to ensure that both the salary and non-salary
components of recurrent costs are adequately funded. In scenario 2: (a) Program costs
are similar to those used in Scenario 1; (b) GDP grows at the CAS base case rate; (b) the
share of the budget allocated to the education sector is made to increase to 2 percent of
GDP in year 2000 and by 0.1 percent per year thereafter; (c) the share of primary and
secondary education is increased from 83.6 percent to 84 percent of the education budget;
that of higher education is kept at 12.4 percent; and that of technical education is reduced
from 4 percent to 3.6 percent of the education budget throughout the life of the program;
(d) the salary budget for all three sub-sectors is made to increase by 1 percent per year
from 1998 onwards (the existing personnel is utilized more efficiently); and (e) the non-
salary budgets for each education sub-sector are computed as residuals (expected
spending minus salary budget). Results are illustrated in Table 7 below:

In scenario 2, the Program is globally sustainable. Within the envelope, there is a
need for marginal reallocations -- towards the non-salary budget in 1999 (3 billion FMG)
and towards the salary budget in 2002 (13 billion FMG).
However, the Program becomes unsustainable after Year 3 if GDP grows at or
below 2% p.a. -- the core case in the CAS. If this were to be the case, Government would
need to downsize its Program, and postpone and/or revise investments which have a
relatively lower priority.
This type of exercise is not aimed at providing a basis for budget allocations.
However, it does highlight the necessity for a close monitoring of the Program costs and
of the evolving macroeconomic conditions, and above all for a proactive budget
management. The ministries in charge of education have to take the lead in (i) prioritizing
their investment program so that "bad" projects do not crowd out projects that do a better
job assisting the country in implementing its sector strategy; (ii) managing more efficiently
the annual budget preparation process to make sure that required resources are made
available to maintain investments in the sector; and (iii) making trade-offs with the sector
and within each sub-sector as needed. There is no a priori budget allocation that will
ensure the sustainability of the program, but the program is sustainable provided the
ministries of education monitor the situation and make the appropriate trade-offs.
Public Expenditure Review. The recently completed (November 1997) Public
Expenditure Review (PER) incorporates the main recommendations highlighted above to
support the Government's Program and to ensure its sustainability. Agreements reached
in the course of the PER include:
(a) the incorporation of all projected investments (on-going as well as proposed
investment projects) within the framework of the Program;
(b) an increase in the share of public resources to the education sector, from 1.5% of
GDP in FY997 to 1.8% in 1998, which is expected to be followed by a gradual
increase to 2.0% by the year 2000;

Madagahscar-Education Setor Development Project                           Page 17
(c) within the proposed budget for education, an increase in the share of public
resources allocated to primary education (from 38.8% of all non-salary recurrent
expenditure to primary and secondary education in FY1997 to 40.6% in FY1998),
while at the same time maintaining the current non-salary budget for higher
education to its FY1997 level (thus reducing its share within the sector from
44.90/o in FY1997 to 44.1% in FY1998);
(d) within the proposed budget for non-salary expenditure for primary and secondary
education, a reallocation of expenditure from central and regional administration to
operating expenditure at the primary school level. For example, the amount of
direct transfers to primary schools would increase from FMG 5.6 billion in
FY1997 (or 14% of the FMG 39.8 billion non-salary budget) to FMG 24 billion in
FY1998 (or 44% of the budgeted FMG 54 billion). These additional resources
would be earmarked for provision of school implements (exercise books, pens,
chalk), school-level administrative expenditure (e.g. student and staff records),
replacement of essential furniture (benches), and maintenance of physical facilities;
(e) a series of measures to ensure timely availability of financial resources (earlier in
the fiscal year) and to improve the rate of disbursements (historically, more than
95% of budget was spent compared to an estimated 70-80% in FY1997 which is
due to recent decisions to decentralize commitment authority to local level that has
led to delays in committing budgetary resources); and
(f) a strict application of budget procedures in higher education in order to avoid
over-spending (public higher education institutions have committed an amount of
FMG 8.5 billion in FY1996 over the allocated budget) and a series of measures to
stop accumulation and absorb past arrears (estimated at about FMG 27 billion over
the period 1992-93 to 1995-96) over a period of 3 years.

procedures were reviewed during Appraisal and found satisfactory. Model bidding documents for
local procurement will be reviewed before the first local competitive bidding for works and goods.
ICB procurement for goods and works will use the Bank's relevant Standard Bidding Documents.
Procurement for goods and works will follow the Bank Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits issued in January 1995 and revised in August 1996. Recruitment of
consultants will use the Bank's standard documents for Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and model
contracts. Selection of consultants will be done on the basis of the Bankls Guidelines: Selection
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers issued in January 1997.

Slight differences in amounts may occur due to rounding of figures.
Figures in parenthesis are the amounts financed by IDA.
(a) "Other" procurement methods include award of civil works contracts on the basis of at least 3
quotations, national and international shopping of goods, selection of consultants, operating
expenditures, training, and FDES.
(b) NIF means "Not IDA Financed".
(c) Consulting services include professional services for supervision of civil works, contracting of
NGOs for district and local levels implementation, and specialized studies.
(d) Operating Costs include the incremental operating costs incurred under the Project by the
Project Management Unit on account of local contractual staff salaries, travel costs and
allowances of Project staff, maintenance of vehicles and equipment, banking charges, and office
rent, supplies and utilities. However, operating costs exclude salaries and benefits to Government
officials in the conduct of their duties as members of the civil service.
(e) Higher Education Grants financed under the Fund for the Development of Higher Education
(FDES) include sub-project or a feasibility study to finance preparatory activities relating to a sub-
project in one of the following areas: development of new training programs; support to applied
research projects; and institutional development initiatives. Higher Education Grants will be
provided in accordance with rules and procedures specified in the Procedures Manual for the
FDES.
Procurement Methods
Civil works financed by the IDA Credit include mostly small rehabilitation works
dispersed over 4,100 primary schools located in about 41 school districts, and 50 secondary
schools (of which 40 lower and 10 upper secondary schools) located in about 10 districts, all
involving the participation of local communities and the use of local construction materials and
techniques. It is anticipated that approximately 50 percent of civil works (or US$12.0 million
equivalent, each contract estimated to cost US$30,000 or more) will be carried out by small
enterprises that already exist in Madagascar, and procured on the basis of national competitive
bidding procedures. No contracts are expected to cost more than US$100,000. The remaining
50 percent of civil works (or US$12.0 million equivalent, each estimated to cost less than
US$30,000) will be carried out by local communities, based on quotations, according to
procedures specified in the Project Implementation Manual acceptable to IDA. All works
supervision will be monitored by contracted firms (AGETIPA, NGO management contractor or
private firms). Architectural designs will use the norms currently applied in Madagascar and
agreed by IDA, including the use of local designs and materials when and where appropriate.
Furniture, equipment and vehicles financed by the IDA Credit include: (a) office
equipment and furniture, and vehicles; and (b) equipment and furniture for classrooms -- for a
total amount of US$8.4 million equivalent. To the extent possible, goods will be grouped into
packages of US$100,000 or more, and procured through ICB (for a total of US$3.4 million) in
accordance with Bank Guidelines, and will consist mostly of vehicles and large office equipment.
Goods consisting mostly of school furniture which cannot be grouped into these packages would
be grouped to the extent possible in packages of US$30,000 or more, but less than US$100,000
per contract, and procured through NCB, provided that the aggregate amount of such

Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                          Page 3
procurement does not exceed US$3.0 million. Goods of US$30,000 or less per contract also
consisting mostly of school furniture would be procured through national shopping, based on
quotations obtained from at least three reliable suppliers, provided the aggregate amount of such
procurement does not exceed US$2.0 million. Procurement of school furniture will involve the
participation of communities.
Textbooks and Teaching / Learning Materials. To the extent possible, textbooks and
teaching / leaming materials will be grouped into packages of US$100,000 or more, and procured
through ICB (for a total amount of US$10.1 million equivalent) in accordance with Bank
Guidelines. Textbooks, teaching-learning materials and distribution of textbooks and materials to
schools which cannot be grouped into these packages and which are estimated to cost less than
US$100.000 per contract would be procured through NCB, provided that the aggregate amount
of such procurement does not exceed US$1.0 million. Reference books and library books
estimated to cost less than US$30,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate amount not to
exceed US$1.0 million would be procured through international shopping.
Consultants Services and  Training.   Recruitment of consultant services for
management, procurement, auditing and various sectoral and technical services, including training,
totaling the amount of US$9.5 million equivalent, would be made on the basis of the quality and
cost based method of selection. Services for institutional studies estimated to cost less than
US$100,000 per contract and US$2.0 million in aggregate, would be procured on the basis of the
quality based method. Audit services estimated to cost less than US$25,000 per contract and
US$0.5 million in aggregate, would be procured using the least cost method. Individual
consultants will be recruited on the basis of qualification and experience. Detailed plans for
consultancies and training activities financed under the project were reviewed during Appraisal
and agreed upon during Negotiations.
FDES Fund. The FDES Fund (US$5.0 million equivalent) will finance a maximum of 75
percent of the costs of feasibility studies and sub-projects. Feasibility studies and sub-projects
under FDES would be eligible for a maximum reimbursement of US$20,000 and US$100,000,
respectively. Implementation and financing of each sub-project will be governed by a tripartite
contract between the Administrator of the Fund, the Malagasy institution(s) initiating the sub-
project and associate institutions, according to procurement procedures specified in the
Procedures Manual acceptable to IDA. Goods, services and civil works required for the purposes
of sub-projects or feasibility studies will be procured in accordance with procedures acceptable to
the IDA and specified in the Procedures Manual.
Review by IDA. The Project Management Unit (Bureau of Project Coordination) will
ensure that Bank guidelines are followed for procurement of goods and services, and will maintain
procurement documents and contracts required for ex-post reviews. Prior to the issuance of any
invitation to bid for contracts, the PMU will submit to IDA, for its review and approval, the
proposed procurement plan for the Project and consultant selection. During project execution,
the first five civil works contracts for in each region will be subject to IDA's prior review at the
beginning of each year. Contracts for packages of goods above the threshold of US$100,000 and
the first NCB contract will be subject to IDA's prior review. The threshold for prior review of
consultant services will be US$100,000 for contracts with consulting firms and US$200,000 when
the technical evaluation report is required for no-objection, and US$25,000 for contracts with

individual consultants. All other contracts wili be subject to selective post review during the
supervision missions. Contracts for FDES sub-projects financed by the Fund amounting to
US$20,000 or more, as well as the first three applications to be submitted by FDES for approval,
irrespective of amounts involved, will be subject to prior review by IDA. The thresholds for
procurement methods and prior review arrangements are illustrated in Table 6-B below.

B. Disbursements, Accounts and Audit
Disbursements will be in accordance with guidelines set out in the Disbursement
Handbook. The project is expected to be completed over a five-year period, by June 30, 2003,
and the Credit is expected to be closed by October 31, 2003. The proposed allocation of the IDA
Credit is shown in Table 6-C below. All applications to withdraw proceeds from the Credit will
be fully documented, except for expenditures for goods, works and consultants' services (firms)
under contracts not exceeding US$100,000 equivalent, consultants' services (individuals) under
contracts not exceeding US$25,000 equivalent, Higher Education Grants not exceeding
US$20,000 equivalent, operating costs and training, for which reimbursement may be made
against certified statements of expenditures (SOEs). The PMU will be responsible for preparing
withdrawal applications and SOEs to be submitted to IDA, and will indicate on the SOEs the
nature and origin of any goods' and the payment date. These will be retained along with all other
supporting documentation for review by Bank supervision missions and independent auditors.

Special Accounts. To ensure that funds will be available when needed, two Special
Accounts (SA) in US$ will be established in a local commercial bank under conditions satisfactory
to IDA. One, in the amount of US$4.0 million, will be opened in the name of the Project
Management Unit (Bureau of Project Coordination), and the other, in the amount of US$0.5
million, will be in the name of FDES. Fifty percent (50%) of these amounts will be withdrawn on
the Credit account after effectiveness; the remainder will be withdrawn as and when dictated by
project activities. The amounts have been estimated to cover about four months of expenditures,
and would be withdrawn form the Credit account after effectiveness. PMU and FDES would
have the right to draw directly on these accounts for project expenditures without prior approval



Project Appraisal Document                                                Annex 6
Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                          Page 7
by the Ministry of Finance.  The Special Accounts would be replenished on the basis of
documentary evidence, provided to IDA by PMU and FDES, of payments made from the
accounts for goods and services required for the project that are eligible for financing under the
Credit. All supporting documents will be retained by PMU and FDES, and made available for
review by periodic Bank supervision missions and external auditors.
Project Accounts. The Government of Madagascar would open two project accounts in
Francs Malagasy in a local commercial bank, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. One,
referred to as the BPC Project Account, would be operated and maintained by the Project
Management Unit, and the other, referred to as the FDES Project Account, would be operated
and maintained by FDES. The Government would make an initial deposit of FMG 2.0 billion into
the BPC Project Account, and FMG 500 million into the FDES Project Account, to cover the
Government's initial contribution to project expenditures. Evidence of the initial deposits is a
condition of credit effectiveness. Thereafter, the Government will deposit each semester an
amount equal to the amount of the initial deposits to replenish the project accounts to their initial
level.
Auditing. A computerized accounting system for financial management and reporting
purposes and an internal control system will be developed and implemented prior to project
effectiveness in the PMU and the FDES. PMU and FDES will maintain separate accounts for all
project activities, in conformity with international accounting practices, to record all project
expenditures, commitments and reimbursements. Specifically, the implementing agencies will
prepare the following documents: a balance sheet; a statement of source and application of funds;
and a statement of fixed assets. The appointment of an independent auditor under a contract
acceptable to IDA will be a condition of effectiveness. The auditor will be requested to audit
these financial statements and express an opinion with respect to project accounts, SOEs, the
Special Accounts, and a statement of the adequacy or otherwise of the accounting system and
internal audit controls. Audit reports will be submitted to IDA within six months after the end of
each fiscal year. During Negotiations, detailed terms of reference were reviewed for the
recruitment of a management consulting / accounting firm that would assist the Project
Management Unit and the FDES in setting up appropriate financial management systems,
including internal control, accounting, and financial and budgeting systems.

Technical Note on the Methodology for
Ministry of Education-Community Collaboration
for School Improvement
Introduction
1.    Since early 1994, the Ministry of Education (MINESEB) has been experimenting with
methods for Ministry-Community collaboration in improving primary education.   Two
experiments have been going on. With financing from the on-going IDA-financed CRESED
(Credit 2094-MAG), the Provincial Department for Education (DEPESEB) in Mahajanga
initiated school-level projects in two school districts (CiSco), and the success of this first attempt
led to the expansion of this Programme de Renforcement et de l'Amelioration de la Gestion
Administrative et Pedagogique (PRAGAP) to eight other CiScos in Mahajanga and to the
approach's introduction in two CiScos in each of the other five provinces. At the same time, the
Ministry has been trying out a similar approach in about fifty communities with assistance from
UNICEF. A supervision mission reviewed these programs in November, 1996. This technical
note reports the mission's observations, conclusions and suggestions on this important initiative.
2.    The mission met with the Central Management Team (ECG) for PRAGAP, UNICEF, and
staff in the DEPESEBs of Antananarivo and Toamasina. The mission visited five schools in
CiSco Tsiroanomandidy in Antananarivo, four in CiSco Brickaville in Toamasina, and two
schools in Toamasina which are participating in the project sponsored by UNICEF. The mission
also examined reports from the ECG and examples of the planning and implementation
documents, including community-school-MNNESEB contracts, from Antananarivo and
Toamasina. School visits, interviews and materials from Mahajanga were reviewed during earlier
missions.
Observations
3.    The results of the programs, in terms of both implementation and impact, have been good.
In general, the preparations for implementation have been thorough, and the sensitization and
participation of the communities seem genuine, though the amount of communities' participation
and their level of "ownership" seem to vary among schools. MNNESEB has delivered materials to
schools, and the teachers and communities have used them to rehabilitate classrooms and to
construct new ones, as agreed in the contracts that have been signed. Also, a start has been made
at deploying teachers according to schools' needs. Summary data on the projects activities and
results to date are attached to this note in Attachments 1 and 2. Highlights of the mission's
observations are:
* At least 80 percent of the schools, both functioning and "closed", in every PRAGAP
CiSco have participated in the program;
* In the 20 PRAGAP CiScos, Grade 1 enrollment increased by 28 percent between 1993-94
and 1995-96, and overall enrollment increased by 15 percent; corresponding increases in



Project Appraisal Document                                                Annex II
Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                           Page 2
the communities served by the other program, on a school-by-school basis, have been even
higher for most schools. These increases compare with a national increase in Grade 1
enrollment over the same period of 15 percent in Grade 1 and 7 percent in total
enrollment;
*  Contracted materials have been delivered to 71 percent of the PRAGAP schools, and
about half of the school communities in the one province for which data is available have
completed the work. In three of the five schools that the mission visited in CiSco
Tsiroanomandidy the community has started or completed construction of other
classrooms or teachers' houses beyond those in the contract;
*  Although complete data is not yet available, anecdotal evidence from some of the
provinces suggests that transfers of teachers (affectations) have formally increased teacher
availability by around one additional teacher for each two schools in participating
PRAGAP CiScos. However, verbal reports from provincial staff indicate that no more
than 25 percent of the teachers have actually taken up their new posts because many are
still able to circumvent their transfer orders;
3  A total of about US$2.0 million has been spent on materials for the 2,528 schools in the
twenty CiScos, averaging around $800 per school.
4.    In addition, the DEPESEBs have implemented the programs effectively, even if the
dialogues with the communities have been brief and probably somewhat directive in this first
attempt. There is extensive planning, monitoring, and control documentation at each DEPESEB
visited, and the ECG has prepared monitoring reports, and it has published extensive data on the
program. However, the MINESEB has not summarized or analyzed the program's strengths,
weaknesses, and impact as fully as the data would allow. Staff at all levels are able to explain the
process that was undertaken and to describe how the work has been completed. On the other
hand, the mission's conversations with school heads, sub-district officers (the "Chef de la Zone
Admiistrative et PNdagogique" or ZAP), and staff in the CiScos suggested that they have not
well understood the program's objectives of increased enrollment and retention and improved
instruction, nor do they yet view themselves as the responsible permanent intermediary between
the community and the Ministry. There seems to be a tendency to focus on the physical
improvements that the program has invested in during this first phase, without yet committing to
this process as a way to achieve ongoing school improvement. Given the brief orientation and
training that have been provided, the mission is not surprised nor discouraged at the lack of
ownership after this pilot stage, and it notes that additional sensitization and training is needed in
the next phases of the program's development.
Major Condusions
5.    The mission has drawn the following major conclusions about the programs:
* Impacts The programs have improved physical schools facilities and increased community
members' interest in supporting their primary school, and this has produced a significant
increase in enrolLments, particularly in grade 1;

Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                           Page 3
*  Process and Management. The mechanisms of school-level consultations, a written
contract, and significant contributions from both Government and communities have
produced the results so far, confirming both MlNESEB's capacity to use this approach
and the communities' commitment to contributing to their children's education.
MINESEB has provided "animation", and the DEPESEBs, CiScos and ZAPs have
coordinated implementation. Success, in its turn, has given rise to new problems and
issues that need to be resolved as the approach increases its coverage and moves towards
institutionalization;
*  Information Dissemination. Conversations with MINESEB staff not directly involved in
the program and with donor organizations which are currently contributing to Education
in Madagascar suggest that people who are not involved in implementing this approach do
not know much about how it works nor what impact it has already had.
Problems, Issues and Suggestions for Further Development
6.    The mission's observations and major conclusions confirm the potential for the PRAGAP
approach to become the MINESEB's instrument for implementing, at least at the primary level,
the "Programme National d'Amilioration de l'Education" (PNAE II) that is being prepared and
proposed as Government policy. Therefore, the mission recommends that experimentation with
the program continue and that it be included in the PNAE II document as the proposed
mechanism for implementing the strategy's bottom-up approach ("demarche ascendante").
Experimentation should continue immediately with the recommendations presented below being
included in another round of PRAGAP contracts in 1997, contracts being prepared and
implemented in the CiScos that are already participating and in one or two additional CiScos in
each province. Subject to the availability of funding from CRESED as it nears completion, it
would be appropriate to use these funds to support this next round of contracts. The MINESEB
should also consider the design and implementation of experiments to apply the approach to the
improvement of secondary education.
7.    Besides identifying the positive aspects of the program, the mission's visits and discussions
have identified areas in the process's design, implementation, and management that can be
improved upon. Also, there are issues around the program components of building rehabilitation
and teacher supply. The paragraphs that follow analyze these points and offer suggestions for the
future.
8.    Design of the Process. To date, the MINESEB has only given general guidelines for the
PRAGAP program's design, and the provinces have adapted the basic three-step process that was
piloted in Mahajanga (a sensitization and contract visit, a visit to monitor the community's
preparation, and a visit to monitor the actual work). The project supported by UNICEF has had
its own approach (see Attachment 3). The mission found during its visits that people explained
this process differently and that some people, particularly school heads and community members,
could not give a general overview of the program. Also, the documentation used in the program
is not entirely uniform and not always available at all levels in the system. This flexible program
design has allowed for local experimentation and adaptations, but it has also probably allowed
some neglect of careful analyses of specific local needs and of genuine dialogues before the



Project Appraisal Document                                                Annex II
Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                           Page 4
contract is signed. There is now enough experience with different variations on the basic
approach to suggest that the following improvements in design:
*  MINESEB should draft a clear, detailed description of the preferred process of
collaboration between MINESEB and each community;
*  The program design should be extended to include a broader range of factors effecting
school quality than just buildings and teacher availability;
The roles and functions of MINESEB staff at each level, but especially for school
directors, should be made explicit, drawing on the newly-prepared "attributions et r6le
des di(ferents intervenants au niveau de l'ecole, de la ZAP, et de la CiSco."
Based on experience to date and these agreed-upon improvements, the M1NESEB agreed to
prepare a draft Implementation Manual (Manuel de Procedures) that: (a) describes in detail the
program's preferred design for implementation; (b) provides draft formats to be used in the
planning and contracting process; (c) outlines the factors (teachers, buildings, teaching skills,
pedagogic materials, health and nutrition, etc.) that can negotiated in the contracts; and (d)
defines the different actors' roles and responsibilities and the interpersonal skills expected of them
in working at the school and community level.
9.    The Implementation Process. The implementation process has succeeded in achieving
agreements, in the form of a written contract, between the communities and the MINESEB, and
the contracts are being implemented well. However, as mentioned above, the mission noted that
many of the actors do not understand the process or the spirit expected of them in its
implementation. In addition, many of the contracts examined by the mission lack sufficient
specificity about quantities to be supplied by both parties, and in some the community members
have not signed the agreement. It appears that the DEPESEBs have made estimates of quantities
based on measurements of classrooms, and they have prepared tables specifying how much of
each material each school will receive before contracting centrally for their supply. Also, at the
school level, the communities have been particularly conscientious in providing their inputs, but
there have been delays in the delivery of materials by the Government; and, as already noted, the
number of transferred teachers who actually moved has been much less than those who were
given transfer notices. Regulations regarding the release of funds and the reporting on their use
before the next release and the inaccessibility of most rural sites contributed to delays in the
delivery of materials; and the teachers who have not moved have been able to obtain from other
sources within the MINESEB official "stays" that have put off their transfers. Solutions to most
of these implementation issues can be included in the Manuel de Procidures, and the solutions
can then be implemented and evaluated in the next cycle of PRAGAP.
10.   Management Capacity. The mission's meetings with staff who have been implementing
these programs at all levels suggest that these people have the confidence, skills, and autonomy to
make the program work. Also, the DEPESEBs appear to be managing implementation carefully
and keeping full records. The mission was impressed by the amount of "report" material that was
presented to it. However, as noted above, the DEPESEBs have encountered delays in the release



Project Appraisal Document                                                Annex 11
Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                           Page 5
of funds and in servicing the most isolated communities, and these problems will probably remain.
There are, however, management problems that deserve resolution. These include: teacher
transfers, devolution of responsibility to local MINESEB staff, ownership by the community, and
data collection.
11.   First and most important, the teachers' ability to subvert their transfer orders must be
reduced. The means for doing this are to tie the deployment of teachers to budgetary posts that
become vacant at a school or administrative unit whenever a teacher moves. The mission noted
with appreciation that the MINESEB intends to create this structure for teacher assignments by
assigning posts to CiScos, thus making this the level at which teachers are assigned.
Consideration should be given to applying the budgetary post approach down to the school level,
at least as a pilot reform in a sample of areas.
12.   The implementation of the two programs has required, to date, the regular participation of
MINESEB and DEPESEB staff in the case of PRAGAP and UNICEF personnel in the case of the
other approach. Higher level staff participation has probably been necessary when piloting these
approaches, but MINESEB cannot adopt a general approach for all schools if the more distant
personnel have to participate in all school visits. The MINESEB should explicitly work to reduce
the number of DEPESEB staff participating directly with communities, eventually evolving a
system that allows the CiScos and Chef ZAPs to work on their own with communities. The
DEPESEB and MINESEB roles would then be primarily for coordinating the process, monitoring
implementation, providing financial control, and evaluating the impact on student access, internal
efficiency and academic achievement.
13.   The sensitization and training sessions at the start of the program were very brief and
many staff in the DEPESEBs, CiScos and ZAPs and the school directors do not seem to
understand the principles of listening and responding to local needs upon which the program is
based.    Significantly, school directors do not feel responsibility as the MINESEB's local
animateur for school improvement. The lack of program "ownership" is not surprising since in
the two provinces in which schools were visited during this mission the only introduction to the
program that staff had were half-day meetings, and school heads only learned formally about the
program's design during the DEPESEB-led meetings with their school community. More time
for training for all actors is needed. This training should focus on: (a) the material in the Manuel
de Procedures; the interpersonal skills the DEPESEB, CiSco and ZAP staff need to have to work
successfully with community members; the factors that determine school quality; and the roles and
responsibilities of each actor, including relevant planning, monitoring and administrative skills.
The mission discussed the form and content of this training with the Central Management Team
(ECG), and the niission recommends that the MINESEB plan a more comprehensive training and
sensitization program using ECG materials and the Unite dVitudes et de Recherche
P&dagogique's (UERP) school quality training model that are already available. This training
should be offered at the beginning of the next implementation cycle of the revised program. At
the same time that existing experience is being used to regularize the program, the mission
commends continuing experimentation, as in the small in-service training pilot projects for which
CiSco Antsirabe II and DEPESEB Mahajanga are planning to submit requests.



Project Appraisal Document                                                Annex 11
Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                           Page 6
14.   While lots data on enrollments, program implementation, and finance are being generated,
there has been very little analysis of the data to date. Also, staff preparing data have not provided
sufficient short summaries for it to be useful to program leaders and for sharing with others.
There is therefore not yet persuasive proof that the program has been working, and it is difficult
to use the data to identify areas of the program that need attention. It was agreed that the
MfNESEB would (a) sponsor a beneficiary assessment of the program and an operational and
financial audit of its performance to date and (b) strengthen its regular data collection by refining
and extending the reporting tables drafted during the mission, and preparing quarterly status
reports on program implementation and impact.
15.  Information Dissemination. The mission observed support at all levels of the system for
the approaches that are being used. Community members that the mission met spoke proudly of
what they have done with assistance from the Government (even while lamenting tardy deliveries
and the need for teachers) and many express renewed confidence that MINESEB can help them
educate their children. Chef ZAPs, Chef CiScos, and DEPESEB staff describe their collaboration
with communities as satisfying; and MIINESEB personnel have begun to realize that a
methodology for the practical and effective implementation of decentralized management is
emerging. On the other hand, this experience has not yet been successfully shared with staff in
MINESEB who are not involved, nor with the donors who support education. This is due in part
to the newness of the program, but steps are being taken to improve dissemination about the
program. The regular reports on implementation and impact and the results of the beneficiary
assessment and the audits that are recommended above will help increase partners' knowledge if
they are disseminated effectively. Also, using the data available and a clear description of the
approach, the MINESEB should mount an information campaign within its own ranks, with the
public and governmental leadership, and with donors. This campaign could include the written
reports, a popularly-written short brochure (in both Malagasy and French), media materials, field
visits, and meetings to share information.
16.   Teacher Demand and Supply. As noted above, there is a need to strengthen the real
capacity of local authorities to deploy teachers where they are needed. It also appears that the
larger problem of whether there are enough teachers deserves additional attention. Additional
teachers will certainly be needed before long if the enrollment growth stimulated by PRAGAP and
the UNICEF-sponsored project continues. Therefore, the mission recommends that MINESEB
examine closely the demand for teachers and their potential supply, by province, using existing
data and that, depending on the findings, alternative ways to increase the number of primary
school teachers inexpensively be explored. Solutions envisaged include the redeployment of some
secondary school teachers, establishment of a fund to pay supplementary teachers (possibly with
the community providing some support to teachers as well), incentives (monetary and non-
monetary) for newly appointed teachers to locate in isolated schools, and to establish the
budgetary post policy noted above (para. 11).
17.   Building Construction. As would be expected in a locally-driven program, the mission
saw significant variety in the durability, and thus cost, of the school buildings that have been
rehabilitated or constructed under both projects, and the work has been done very cost-effectively
with significant community participation, especially in the PRAGAP communities. In particular,



Project Appraisal Document                                                 Annex 11
Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                           Page 7
the PRAGAP schools in CiSco Brickaville, a cyclone area, have been constructed so simply that
the next cyclone will probably destroy them, but they have been done at one-seventh to one-tenth
of the cost of the durable buildings provided through other programs. This situation raises
questions about the trade-off between cost and durability and between community participation in
work using simple local construction standards versus more permanent methods and materials
requiring contractors. The mission recommends that MINESEB consider alternative construction
possibilities to derive a policy that will maximize the permanence of new construction and still
guarantee a significant role for the community. The idea was broached of having different
classroom structural designs at alternative levels of investment with community contributions
becoming greater for more expensive construction. The communities could then play an
important vested role in choosing a design for their school, and the probability of their effective
participation and future responsibility for the buildings would be enhanced.
Conclusion
18.   Through successful implementation of MlNESEB-community collaboration programs, the
MINESEB and the DEPESEBs have given proof to the possibility of defining practical
procedures for decentralized educational development. The programs reviewed by the mission
are involving communities directly in efforts to improve the education of Madagascar's children,
and they are giving proof to the Government's capacity to deliver support at the school level.
Everyone involved is contributing to creating this unique approach for Government's investment
and leadership in education in the context of a general strategy to reinvigorate education. The
results to date -- in terms of enrollment increases, community involvement, and the definition of
the approach -- are striking.

Program and Project Implementation Arrangements
1.    Introduction.  The Government's Program (PNAE II) has set down not only the
objectives and content of a fully integrated strategy, but also the means by which that strategy will
be implemented. Inherent in the strategy of implementation is a two-fold approach involving
partnership between communities and schools, on the one hand, on the other the improvement of
management at district, regional and national levels to assist schools in the more effective delivery
of educational services. The proposed Sector Investment Program in common with the
contribution of other donors will adopt the same implementation strategies and arrangements.
2.    In order to coordinate the contributions of all donors in the sector in a context where each
donor has different regulations and internal procedures (procurement, disbursement, etc.) the
Government intends to take two major initiatives. Firstly, a management information system will
be established to collect, collate, process and make available to managers at all levels and donors
alike detailed information as a basis for implementation. Secondly, Government will institute an
annual cycle of activities to confront the needs expressed at school and district levels with the
resources available, and to finalize with donors an annual investment program at various levels.
3.    The Functions and the Information Flow. There are five different levels and each of
these levels has defined functions in the above process, some of which are discrete and some of
which interlock with the adjacent levels. Information flow will take place between and through
these levels:
*  the school;
*  the office of the administrative and educational sub-district officer -- ZAP or Zone
Administrative et Pedagogique;
*  the District Office - CiSco or Circonscription Scolaire; and
*  the provincial and/or regional office -- DEPESEB  or Direction Provinciale de
l'nseignement Secondaire et de lEAducation de Base; and
* the central level -- the Ministry of Education.
4.    At the school level, the major activities will comprise the conduct of an inventory with the
assistance of the ZAP which will provide the basis for the assessment of need and the estimate of
the financial resources which will be necessary to respond to those needs. In this process the
Head Teacher has a crucial role of motivating the community and organizing the establishment of
a School Committee which in turn will assist in definition of a school-based project. The School
Committee will take the responsibility for the negotiation and signature of the School Contract
and for the monitoring of its inputs including the contributions of both community and
Government.
5.    The main facilitator of this process at school level is the ZAP Officer. The Officer will
visit and sensitize the school communities about the contractual school-based projects. In the first



Project Appraisal Document                                                     Annex 12
Madagascar - Education Sector Development Project                                Page 2
instance, the Officer will assist the school community to carry out a school inventory and prepare
a costed draft of the school project. The information from all the schools in the ZAP (on average
10 schools) will be consolidated and expressed in the form of a sub-district plan which will be
transmitted to district level (CiSco). Conversely, the Officer will receive the details from district
level of resources which will be available to the sub-district for each financial year. The officer
will then have the responsibility, on the basis of clearly defined criteria, for determining resources
that' will be made available to each school. Further, the Officer will have the responsibility for
signing school contracts on behalf of the MINESEB and assisting the School Council in defining
the types of inputs which will be required. The Officer will also assist the school community in
monitoring the outcomes and in transmitting this information to the district level.
6.    At the CiSco level, the District Officer and his assistants have the task of assisting both
the ZAP Officer and the schools in their tasks, collecting the data from all schools and school
districts which are necessary for the formulation of a coherent district rolling program and
delivering major services as part of the overall "package of inputs" (see para. 14) which is to be
made available to primary schools.
7.    At the regional / provincial level, the tasks are three-fold. Firstly, to collect the statistics
from the districts and assemble them into a coherent regional program. Secondly, to provide
directly or indirectly the services which have been requested as part of their package by individual
School Councils. Thirdly, to control and regulate the budget which has been allocated at regional
level from the various sources (Government, donors, NGOs, private, etc.) in order to provide the
resources to support the delivery of services at the school level.
8.    At the central level, the Ministry of Education has the responsibility for steering and
coordinating the whole program and for evaluating both outcomes and resource needs. It
achieves these functions either directly through the Provincial and District offices or as in the case
of the collection of data by means of the management information system. More specifically at
the central level, the functions associated with implementing the Government's program are: (a) in
conjunction with donors, to identify a two-year rolling program for activities and an annual
resource allocation to support those activities; (b) to liaise with donors with regard to their
resource inputs on an annual basis; (c) to deliver parts of the package of services to regional,
district and school level; (d) to allocate the necessary resources in the form of finances and /or
entitlement to services to the regional level; (e) to collect and collate the necessary statistics
through the management information system for the appropriate deployment of financial resources
to districts and to schools; (f) to monitor, evaluate and produce regular reports for donors on the
progress of the implementation of the Government's program. This latter function implies the
conduct, at all four levels, of a continuous process of formative and annual summative evaluation
of all inputs, financial and educational.
9.    Implementation Structure. For the implementation of its overall program as well as the
necessary liaison with donors, the Government envisages a strengthening of managerial capacity
at all levels.
10.   At the school level, the School Committee, comprising representatives of the village
community, the Head Teacher and the teachers has premier responsibility for the preparation,



Project Appraisal Document                                                Annex 12
Madascar - Education Sector Development Project                             Page 3
negotiation and implementation of the school project and the monitoring of its progress with the
aim of improving pupil learning and access to education. The coordination of the various inputs
to results in these objectives is the major responsibility of the school under the supervision of the
School Committee. The School Committee also has the responsibility for the formulation of
requests for additional inputs or for inputs for subsequent years.
11.   As the major facilitator, the sub-district ZAP Officer is at the center of activities which
result in the members of community preparing their school project and negotiating and concluding
their school contract with their ministry. Equally, it is at this level that responsibility rests for
support to the community in the form  of workshops, follow-up activities in terms of
implementation of the terms of the contract, not least concerning the obligations of the
Government, the production and compilation into report form of information concerned with
progress achieved, as well as statistical reports for transmission to the district level.  The
formulation of operational recommendations to the district with regard to resource needs or
requests for additional action, including of a corrective nature, also take place at this level.
12.   Each of the 112 CiScos will have the mandate of defining, preparing, and monitoring
implementation of the Government's program in their area, on which all parties have agreed with a
view to improving the quality of learning and access to primary school in collaboration with the
sub-district ZAP Officer, the Head teachers, the teachers and communities. These teams will
comprise 3 to 5 members of the District Office which will in turn be supported by the central unit
and by the Provincial team with the services of the Ministry available to them. Their work will be
conducted in close collaboration with the ZAP Officer who, supported by the resources of the
District, is the main facilitator of the process of collaboration between the community and the
ministry.
13.   At the regional / provincial level, there would be a small team of 3 to 4 staff selected on
the basis of their qualifications and professional experience which will have the responsibility for
the relay of information and resources between central and district levels. They will also have the
responsibility for the facilitation of the work of their colleagues at district level, and for the
delivery of certain services of professional development.
14.   At central level, a small group of about 8 civil servants chosen of the basis of their
professional experience and qualification profile will be engaged for a period of 2 to 4 years
according to Terms of Reference which derive from the functions to be fulfilled in the
implementation of the Government's program. It will be this central unit which will have the
direct and day-to-day responsibility for managing and coordinating the implementation of the
national program, including overall control of financial and other resources inputs, delegation of
responsibility to other levels of management, definition of two-year programs of implementation
and of annual financial plans, definition of expected outcomes and the monitoring and evaluation
of the progress of the implementation of the Governments program, as well as the preparation of
on-going evaluative reports.
15.   Package of Inputs. The package of inputs which will be made available to all schools will
be defined at central level, but the take-up of the elements which comprise the package will be a
result of the needs assessment conducted by the School Council with the assistance of the Sub-



Project Appraisal Document                                                   Annex 12
ada a - Education Sector Development Project                                  Page 4
district team at local level. The elements of the package could comprise: (a) assistance with civil
works in the form of materials, technical assistance and transfer of know-how and quality control;
(b) textbooks and educational materials, including information on the care of these items in order
to maximize their useful life; (c) furniture and other necessary equipment; (d) professional services
of supervision, training, and facilitation for the school committee, the Head Teacher and the staff
of the school; and (e) deployment and presence of teaching staff according to the school
establishment defined on the basis of the school mapping exercise. Some of these elements will be
delivered directly from central or regional levels. Others will be delivered at district and/or sub-
district level in the form of entitlements to goods and services (see Annex 6 on Procurement
Arrangements).
16.   Budgetary Planning and Implementation. The govermnent's program implies resource
inputs from a number of different sources: Government, donors and NGOs, in a mixture which
will be defined at central, regional and district levels. This mixture will necessitate the preparation
of detailed annual work and financing plans which will need to be prepared in consultation with
schools and shared with donors prior to the commencement of each financial year. Because not
ail donors will be working in all areas and all schools, nor will all of them be providing all of the
components of a package, the planning of the financing of inputs will need to be the subject of a
series of arbitration agreements at those levels. In cases where donors are financing developments
in a given district or region, but are not providing all elements of a package, a government fund of
approximately US$5.0 million a year will be established in order to equalize the package available
to all schools and all districts in all regions. For the purposes of IDAts contribution, as donor of
last resort, a central special account will be established with six regional special accounts.
Disbursements from these special accounts may take place directly or in the form of drawing
rights by districts. Schools will have access to drawing rights only in the form of goods or
services (and not cash).
17.   Sustainability. Based on the experience of the implementation of community-based
primary school projects (e.g. PRAGAP, UNICEF, FID, NGOs), the Government envisages
measures to secure sustainability at three major levels: school, district and national. At the school
level, the contract will ensure that, after construction, communities will continue to provide
matching services and local materials to maintain their school every year. At primary school level,
local communities will also be responsible for taking appropriate measures to increase the life of
textbooks and to safeguard their educational materials. Their requests for recurrent support will
be transmitted through the ZAP officer to the district. At district level, the CiSco officer will be
responsible for securing sustainability by evaluating the requests for recurrent expenditure in the
form of finance or other inputs from school communities and arbitrating amongst them in order to
reconcile the demands with the budget that has been allocated from regional level. The district
will then transmit the allocated budget to the ZAP.
18.   At national level, the Government will earmark 3 percent of the non-salary recurrent
budget for maintenance (an average of FMGl .2 billion) per year. This will be allocated to the
CiScos for further distribution on the basis of expressed needs by the school communities, the
evaluation of the ZAP officer and matched with the provision of local materials and services. A
sum will be earmarked by Government for the regular renewal of the stock of textbooks and

teaching staff which will be a crucial element in sustainability, the Government will undertake
measures to deploy teachers on the basis of a teaching establishment for each school. These
measures will include at primary and secondary levels: (i) a fund at district level to assist the
redeployment of staff; (ii) community recruitment and training of primary school teachers; (iii)
severance packages for staff who are surplus to establishment; (iv) time limits for staff who are
surplus to find an alternative position with another institutional establishment; (v) payment of staff
by number of hours taught. At higher education level, measures would include: (i) increase in the
mandatory workload; and (ii) increase in the proportion of fixed term appointments.
19.   In order to guarantee the long-term  sustainability of the Government's program  in
educational and financial terms, a careful accounting will be undertaken of the incremental
recurrent costs associated with the program and any investment in the form of support for
recurrent costs, e.g. European Union which is on a declining basis. During Appraisal, a five-year
estimate of the long term implications of the implementation of the program will be reviewed with
Government. In order to ensure educational sustainability, the program of continual professional
development at all levels will gradually be intensified, as will the quantity and quality of
supervisory and advisory visits to schools, so that improving standards can be delivered even after
the completion of the program. To this end, careful monitoring of the major program indicators,
such as improvement in learning and increase in access, will take place of specific educational
indicators outlined in Annex 1, as well as the norrnal processes of financial monitoring and
auditing.
