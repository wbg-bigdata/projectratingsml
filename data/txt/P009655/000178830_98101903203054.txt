HARYANA AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises an Agricultural Credit Project in the State
of Haryana for which an IDA credit of US$25.0 million equivalent is propnsed.
It would support a three-year lending program for investments in minor
irrigation and farm mechanization.
ii.       Most of the land in Haryana is used for agricultural purposes,
3.4 million ha out of a total area of 4.4 million ha. About 1.2 million ha
is cropped more than once annually, giving a total cropped area of some 4.6
million ha. About 1.7 million ha (50%) is irrigated, two-thirds by canal
systems and the remainder by wells. In 1969 there were about 50,000 tube-
wells and 90,000 dug wells. Minor irrigation has played an important part
in the increased production in recent years; foodgrain production (Haryana
produces a surplus) rose from about 2 million tons annually in the 1950's
to 4.5 million tons in 1969/70. Haryana generally has adequate groundwater
resources and the Project would finance an additional 11,000 tubewells and
some sprinkler irrigation equipment in areas of sandy and undulating land.
iii.      Continuing growth of production depends upon increasing the
double-cropped area, particularly under irrigated conditions, which enables
farmers to make the best use of new high yielding varieties and fertilizers.
Harvesting of the "kharif" crop (September/October), which is often rice
or cotton, and land preparation for the "rabi" (November) wheat crop require
to be done speedily if optimum wheat yields are to be obtained. Under pre-
vailing conditions in Haryana this requires mechanization of land preparation
and cultivation. The State Government and the Haryana Agro-Industries
Corporation (HAIC) estimated the demand at some 10,000 additional tractors
over the Project period. A careful analysis based on the planned increase
in the double-cropped area, tractor use, and overall availability of tractors
shows that 6,000 tractors would be required and this is the number included
in the Project.
iv.       The Project, therefore, consists of a three-year program which
would assist in financing on-farm investments in minor irrigation (US$12.1
million) and farm mechanization, tractors, harvesters, and spares (US$32.4
million). The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$21.2 million
equivalent or about 48% of total Project costs. IDA would finance US$25.0
million equivalent (56% of Project costs), being the foreign exchange com-
ponent and about one-third of the local currency costs of minor irrigation
investments. However, the transfer by GOI to ARC of the proceeds of the sale
of initial tractor spares to dealers (US$2.7 million equivalent) would have
the effect of increasing IDA's contribution to local currency costs of minor
irrigation to about 56%. Farmers' contributions would be 20% in the case of
minor irrigation and 25% for farm mechanization investments, with the
exception of small farmers as defined by the Agricultural Refinance
Corporation (ARC), when the contribution in respect of tubewell investments



- ii -
would be 10%. The remaining finance would be provided by the Haryana State
Cooperative Land Mortgage Bank (SLMB), participating commercial banks, and
ARC which would also be the channel for IDA finance. ARC is already acting
in this capacity for three other IDA supported agricultural credit projects
in Gujarat, Punjab, and Andhra Pradesh.
v.        The IDA credit to the Government of India (GOI) would be made
available to ARC at an effective interest rate of 4-3/4% per annum repayable
over nine years. GOI would bear the exchange risk. ARC would supervise
and refinance at 6-1/2% per annum the lending operations of SLMB and such
participating commercial banks as would meet the criteria laid down by ARC.
Loans to individual borrowers would bear interest at 9% per annum and would
be repayable over periods up to seven years (nine years in the case of small
farmers' investments in tubewells), including one year of grace in respect
of minor irrigation loans, with the exception of loans for self-propelled
combines which would be up to five years.
vi.       The implementation of the minor irrigation schemes would be by
local contractors, or hired labor, using local materials. About 11,000
individual on-farm investments would be made and international competitive
bidding would not, therefore, be appropriate. Tractors to be procured under
the Project would be imported and sold to farmers through existing commercial
channels. Orders would be based on individual farmers' preferences and
bulked in order to obtain quantity discounts using the same type of proce-
dures which have already been approved for the Punjab and Andhra Pradesh
projects. At present five foreign tractor suppliers from Bank member
countries are eligible to supply and seven others are under consideration.
Licenses would be issued for the import of an initial stock of tractor and
harvesting machinery spare parts procured under the Project. Combines and
tractor drawn harvesters would be procured through international competitive
bidding. In the case of harvesters, Indian manufacturers would be entitled
to bid with a 15% preference.
vii.      ARC and SLMB have competent management and are in sound financial
condition. Financial returns to farmers, based on prevailing prices, are
estimated to range from 39% to 66%. The rates of return to the economy based
on world market prices are estimated to be from 22 to 27% for minor irrigation
and 15% for mechanization. The appropriate assurances having been obtained
the Project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$25.0 million.

HARYANA AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1968 an IDA mission, with assistance of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative
Program, reviewed agricultural credit institutions and on-farm investment
requirements in selected parts of India and identified high priority agri-
cultural credit projects. Three of these projects (Gujarat, Punjab and
Andhra Pradesh) have been approved by IDA, totalling IDA financing of US$86.9
million; in addition to the proposed project for Haryana a fifth agricul-
tural credit project in Tamil Nadu is under consideration. Assisted through
institutional credit, farmers would make investments in minor irrigation
and farm mechanization and thereby obtain increased production and other
benefits from new high-yielding seed varieties, fertilizer use, and surface
water irrigation facilities.
1.02      Bank Group lending for India's agriculture (excluding US$23 million
for the Beas Equipment Project under the Indus Treaty) totals US$238 million.
Past lending has been concentrated on water development and in continuation
of this, two other irrigation projects are under appraisal. In support of
the Government of India's (GOI) new agricultural strategy, the Bank Group
continues to give increased emphasis to on-farm investments, such as can be
encouraged under agricultural credit projects.
1.03      This Project was prepared by the Haryana Government, with guidance
from ARC, and follows closely the pattern established for this type of proj-
ect by preparation assistance made available for earlier projects by the
FAO/IBRD program. In November 1970, Messrs. W.H. Spall and K.W. Berg (IDA),
R.A. Crofts and H. McDonald (consultants) appraised the project in the field.
This report is based on the Government's project submission and the mission's
findings.
II. BACKGROUND OF AGRICULTURE
A. India I/
2.01      Since 1965 India has changed the emphasis of its development
efforts from industry to the agricultural sector. As a result, priority
has been given in recent years to accelerating the introduction of the new
agricultural technology, through increasing the availability of improved
inputs and by providing economic incentives to farmers. The new agricultural
strategy has already brought encouraging results; emphasizing investments

culture in India is given in "Economic Situation and Prospects of
India", Report No. SA-25a shortly to be circulated.

in irrigation facilities and farm machinery to enable more multiple cropping
and shifts to higher value crops. The increased use of high yielding seed
varieties and fertilizers have particularly contributed to a significant
increase in farm production.
2.02      Although 70% of India's labor force is engaged in agriculture
(providing half India's GDP) only a small proportion of farmers have, so far,
benefited from this agricultural advance. A vastly increased number of
farmers could, however, take advantage of the new techniques if helped with
credit. If the momentum of agricultural growth is to be maintained, the
availability of credit for on-farm investment needs to be increased.
2.03      The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has estimated that credit insti-
tutions will require Rs 15,000 million (US$2,000 million) for agricultural
investment during the five years of the Fourth Plan. Taking an annual
average of Rs 3,000 million, this compares with about Rs 600 million invested
in 1966/67. Short-term credit demands are expected to amount to Rs 20,000
million (US$2,666 million) in 1973/74, five times the level of current
advances, and overall agricultural credit requirements are expected to in-
crease five-fold from the mid-sixties to the end of the Plan period. If
these substantial credit demands are to be met, India will need to mobilize
more of its own, particularly rural, savings and increase external borrow-
ings.
2.04      Farm mechanization for India as a whole is still at an early stage.
Some aspects such as the use of pumps for shallow wells and tubewells have
moved ahead rapidly over the past decade and can be expected to continue on
an expanded scale. Use of mechanical or powered threshers and sprayers has
also expanded sharply. Total farm tractor population in India, now esti-
mated at about 100,000, is expected to increase at a rate of about 15-25,000
per year over the next several years. Government plans call for a substan-
tial increase in tractor production moving from the present level of 17,000
per year to a level of 60,000 tractors per year during the current plan
period. The Plan estimates annual tractor demand at 70,000 tractors per
year in 1973/74. Current high domestic prices for wheat, increasing wage
rates and the relatively low price of tractors have encouraged this trend.
The three previous IDA credit projects provide financing for 11,000 tractors
over the period 1971-74.
B. The State of Haryana
Area and Population
2.05      The State of Haryana came into existence in 1966 and is situated
in the northwest of India (see Map). With an area of 44,000 km2, it is the
second smallest State in India, representing about 1.4% of total area,
while its population is about 10 million or 1.8% of the country's total.
About 83% of Haryana's population lives in villages depending largely on
agriculture and 71% of the State's working force is engaged in agriculture.



- 3 -
Only one city (Ambala Gantt) has more than 100,000 inhabitants. Adminis-
tratively, the State is divided into seven districts which are subdivided
into 32 "tehsils".
2.06       The State is bounded by Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh,
Rajastan, and the city of Delhi. Except for some minor ridges in the south-
west and north, Haryana forms a part of the Indo-Gangetic Plain with a mean
height of 300 m above sea level. Soils are alluvial in origin and mostly
sandy, becoming slightly heavier and loamy in the eastern part of the State.
The climate is of continental character, extremely hot in summer (49°C) and
near freezing in winter. The average annual rainfall is 660 mm, ranging
from over 1,000 mm in the northeast to less than 300 mm in the southwest.
About two-thirds of this falls during the monsoon months July to September.
Light winter rains in December and January are of great value for spring
wheat.
Agricultural Structure
2.07       Out of the entire State area (4.4 million ha), 3.4 million ha or
77% is used agriculturally. About 1.2 million ha is sown more than once
annually, giving a total cropped area of 4.6 million ha (1965/66-1968/69
average) which is cultivated by about 650,000 holdings. There are 75,000
farms (11% of holdings) of more than 12 ha in Haryana which together farm
about 1.1 million ha (32% of all agriculturally used land), while 160,000
farms of 6-12 ha total 1.3 million ha (or 38%); the balance of 0.9 million
ha comprises about 420,000 holdings of less than 6 ha each. In practice,
however, operational holdings are much larger since several family holdings
are often farmed as one unit. Some land reform has taken place mainly
concerned with protecting tenants' occupancy rights and assisting them to
become land owners. Because of the transfer of population following parti-
tion in 1947, owner occupancy and the limitation of size of individual
holdings have proceeded further than in many other States. Land consolidation
is almost completed and compact holdings, made up of a number of regular
fields of about one acre (0.4 ha), predominate. In addition, out of about
275,000 farmers with holdings of less than 4 ha, many of whom are at
subsistence level and economically submarginal, some 100,000 (36%) will be
catered for by Haryana's Small Farmers Development Agency which will provide
subsidies for on-farm development.
2.08      About 1.7 million ha, or 50%, of the State's agricultural land is
irrigated. The most important sources for irrigation (70% of total) are
the western Yamuna and the Bhakra Canal systems, while the rest (30%) is
irrigated by dug wells and tubewells. In 1969 there were about 50,000
tubewells and 90,000 dug wells installed of which 28,000 were installed
during the past two years; approximately one-third of the dug wells is
energized. The present water utilized for irrigation in Haryana is about
10 billion m3 a year from canals and 3.7 billion m3 a year from groundwater
sources.
2.09       Haryana produces a surplus of foodgrains, the most important crops
within the cropping pattern, which occupy about 77% of total cropped area;



- 4 -
5% is under cotton, 4% under sugarcane, 2% under oilseeds and the rest (12%)
is planted under other commercial and subsistence crops. There is an
increasing trend in planting cotton and sugarcane, while the area planted
to oilseeds is decreasing. Wheat is the most important single crop,
occupying 22% of the toal cropped area; 20% is planted with millet, 5% with
rice, 3% with barley, 2% with maize, and 25% with various pulses. Total
foodgrain production rose impressively from about 2.0 million tons annually
in the 1950's to 4.0 million tons in 1967/68 and, after a drop to 2.8 million
tons in 1968/69, to 4.5 million tons in 1969/70. Cropping intensity over
the last five years has averaged about 133%.
Agricultural Inputs and Services
2.10      Supply and use of improved seed and fertilizer have increased
considerably in recent years. Fertilizer consumption rose from 70,000 tons
in 1966/67 to 163,000 tons in 1967/68, 238,000 tons in 1968/69, and 270,000
tons in 1969/70, representing about 77 kg per cultivated ha. Distribution
was, until recently, exclusively through village cooperatives, but private
distributors now compete and supply is satisfactory. About 80% of Haryana's
total grain area is planted with improved seeds, including high yielding
varieties; the latter cover about 53% in case of wheat; 10% for rice and
maize; and 20% for millet. The low figure for rice is mainly due to the
fact that lower yields from existing strains (particularly Basmati) are
offset by higher market prices.
2.11      Responsibility for agricultural research and education is vested
in the newly founded Haryana Agricultural University, Hissar, which, until
recently, formed a part of Punjab Agricultural University. It has made an
important contribution to the development of Punjab's and Haryana's agricul-
ture; in Ilaryana, particular emphasis is given to practical education in
agriculture for young farmers at the University as well as at various other
places in the State. Selected courses are given in farm management, agri-
cultural machinery, plant protection, horticulture and animal husbandry.
It also aids the extension wing of the Agricultural Department of Haryana
Government through special seminars. Together, the University and Department
of Agriculture provide an integrated research, education, and extension
service. The latter is of satisfactory quality, but needs strengthening in
the field of hydrology (para 3.04).
Agricultural Development Priorities
Introduction
2.12      Possibilities for extension of the area under cultivation are
limited.  Since most of Haryana's suitable lands are already used, further
increases in agricultural production will have to be attained by sustained
improvements in land productivity. Land productivity is determined by the
extent of double cropping, the crops in the rotation, and yield levels; its
improvement requires three sets of inputs:



- 5 -
(a)  irri,ation facilities to sustain intensified land use
botlh in terms of higher croppilng intensities and more
dvemanding croPping patterns:
(b)  farming systemas and tools whicil ensure timely culti-
vation cycles: and
(c)  availability and application of the ingredients of
improved techinology, i.e. seeds, fertilizer, pesticides,
etc.
On-farm investments for minor irrigation (Annex 1), land development, and,
where anpropriate, farm mechanization (Annex 2) thus assume a very high
priority - next in importance only to the availability of current production
requisites.
Minor Irrigation
2.13      Minor irrigation is becoming increasingly important in Ilaryana.
Out of the present 1.7 million ha of irrigated land (para 2.08), about 30%
or 500,000 ha are irrigated from groundwater sources (dug wells and tube-
wells). These wells have made an important contribution to the increased
production in recent years in Ilarvana. The ARC (Annex 3) and the Haryana
SLMTB (Annex 4) have played an important part in their financing. SLMB loans
for minor irrigation represented 69% of total lending during the last three
years and the number of loans for sinking dug wells and tubewells increased
from 1,000 in 1966/67 to 3,000 in 1967/68 and 10,000 in 1968/69. ARC has
refinanced so far (up to June 30, 1970) a total of 6,500 tubewells and 1,500
dug wells in Haryana State with an ARC contribution of Rs 43 million (US$5.8
million). The State is well supplied with groundwater (deriving consider-
able benefit from the Himalayan watershed) and except in limited areas (in-
cluding Rhotak district) large tracts are very suitable for minor irrigation
exploitation (Annex 1). Because of the often high water table tubewells
are usually quite shallow, not exceeding 30 m in depth.  The Soil Conserva-
tion Organization of the Ministry of Agriculture (SCO) has established 150
observation wells under ongoing ARC schemes which are monitored once a
month during the first year after sinking and quarterly thereafter. An
increase in the number of tubewells would require an increase in the number
of observation wells to monitor adequately changes in the water table to
determine future water development (para 3.05). In regard to the energiz-
ing of wells, Harvana is the most advanced State in India; all villages
are now electrified, the first State in India to achieve this. Electricity
rates to farmers (Rs 0.15 per kwh) are among the highest in India. Where
land is undulating and sandy, sprinkler irrigation has become popular with
progressive farmers since levelling of existing sand dunes is costly and
loss of water through seepage from surface irrigation is high (para 3.06).
Mechanization
2.14      Since most of the land in Haryana is used for agriculture, in-
creased agricultural production depends upon whether more land can be



double cropped, particularly under irrigated conditions. Mechanization
facilitates double cropping enabling the farmer to make better use of
irrigation facilites, of new high yielding varieties and of fertilizers.
Harvesting of the "kharif" crop (September/October), which is often rice or
cotton, and land preparation for the planting of the "rabi" crop (November),
which is mostly wheat, must be done speedily. In order to get optimum
yields, wheat has to be planted within about 39 days of the harvesting of
the previous crops. Delay beyond this period results in a progressive falling
off of yields. More bullock power can achieve a limited increase in double
cropping, but above a certain intensity a further increase is very difficult
to achieve because of the amount of land lost to fodder production to main-
tain draft animals. In practice, however, this and other physical factors
(labor shortage during the crucial period) combined with economic factors
(maintenance for the whole year of additional draft animals which would be
effectively used only during a short period) have made farmers in Haryana,
where wheat is the most important crop, turn to the use of tractors and
harvesters. The latter maciine becomes particularly important in areas
where wheat planting follows rice harvest. Due to this increasing demand
for tractors and a shortage of supply and unrealistic low tractor prices,
a second hand market premium of up to 50% over new tractor list prices has
developed (Annex 2). IDA has discussed tractor pricing with the Indian
Authorities and has been informed that GOI is taking steps to be released
from arrangements binding tractors at a zero import duty under GATT; success-
ful conclusions are expected in the near future.
2.15      In 1969 there were about 10,000 tractors in use in Haryana, many
of them very old models.  The State Government and HAIC estimated the demand
over the next three years, at current prices and price relationships (para
2.04), to be an additional 10,000 tractors over and above the share which
Haryana would receive from Indian tractor production and scheduled imports,
and ignoring replacements for obsolescence in the existing tractor park.
A rise in tractor prices, requiring higher levels of utilization and causing
a reduction in speculative purchases, would reduce this demand substantiallv,
probably by as much as 25%.  An analysis (Annex 2) shows that about 6,000
additional tractors (taking into account Indian production and imports and
allowing for obsolescence) could be used economically over the next three
years without serious risk of over-capitalization of Haryana farmers and
this number of tractors would be provided under the Project (para 3.07).
2.16      Existing tractor manufacturers in India maintain about 40 tractor
service workshops in Haryana, 34 of which belong to dealers appointed by
manufacturers. There is an adequate network of private dealers who are
required by the firms they represent to maintain designated standards in
regard to workshops, servicing, repair, and spare part facilities. They
offer free warranty inspections, post-warranty service schemes at fixed
annual rates together withi on-farm training of tractor operators and farmers.
In addition, the Haryana Agro-Industries Corporation (HAIC) handles within
the State the distribution, maintenance, and spare part facilities of
tractors imported from East European countries. It also assembles Zetor
tractors with technical assistance from the parent Czechoslovakian company.
Despite the private dealer and HAIC network of servicing units there are



- 7 -
many small village repair shops which provide on-the-spot service at reason-
able rates. Existing sales, repair, and servicing facilities are considered
adequate.
2.17      Tractor implements are manufactured in Haryana to a large extent.
While not of the latest design, their prices are reasonable; quality, ex-
cept for some hard steel components, which have to be imported, is satis-
factory, and there is a sufficient supply.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Brief Description
3.01      The Project, which would be part of the lending program of SLMB
and its federated Primary Banks (PLMBs) and commercial banks, would help
finance over a period of three years farmers' investments in minor irriga-
tion (29% of total investments) and farm mechanization (71%) for farmers
and contractors, totalling about US$44.5 million equivalent. It also in-
cludes provision for an initial set of spare parts for tractors and harvest-
ing machinery. The Project would be implemented through the Haryana SLMB
and its federated PLMBs and commercial banks (Annex 5) under refinance
arrangements with ARC. It would involve about 11,000 loans for shallow
tubewells and sprinkler irrigation to farmers and 6,000 loans for imported
tractors, together with suitable implements, and 120 grain harvesters to
farmers or contractors. Incremental production arising from these invest-
ments would mainly be in foodgrains, particularly wheat, and seed cotton
and sugarcane.
3.02      The following table shows the investments expected to be made
over the three-year period:

B. Detailed Features
Minor Irrigation
3.03      Investments in minor irrigation would involve sinking about
11,000 shallow tubewells (costing about Rs 5,000 to 9,000 each) and instal-
lation of 75 sprinkler irrigation sets (Rs 25,000 each) in specified areas
(Appendix 1-2 and Map). Shallow tubewells would be of 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5
cusecs capacity, supplying, respectively, irrigation for about 3 ha (on about
2,000 farms), 5 ha (about 3,000 farms) and 8 ha (about 6,000 farms). In
total, about 69,000 ha (para 3.02) would be irrigated by these shallow tube-
wells with a depth generally not exceeding 30 m; all would be electrified.
Previously, fanners were required to deposit with the Haryana Electricity
Board Rs 2,500 which formed part of the loan to the farmer. Since elec-
trification in Ilaryana is now complete (para 2.13) such a deposit is no
longer required and would be excluded from financing under this Project
with the exception of Rs 500 per tubewell for statutory connection charges
which are considered as capital costs.
3.04      Well drilling is presently done by local contractors; adequate
equipment and skill are available locally to carry out this portion of the
progran.  The lending banks (para 4.01) would, in all cases seek the tech-
nical approval of the SCO, which would be responsible for the technical
appraisal of wells to be sunk under the Project. The technical competence
of SCO is satisfactory, but an increase in staff would be necessary to cope
with the additional work involved. SCO should, therefore, appoint more
technicians with a bachelor degree in engineering or geology and preferably
specialized in groundwater hydrology. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that the Haryana Government would ensure that at all times the
SCO has sufficient qualified technical staff available to provide lending
banks with the necessary advice and assistance.
3.05      In order to provide additional data for proper water management
and utilization, the SCO would establish and monitor three observation wells
(or about 300 wells) for each 100 shallow tubewells sunk under the Project;
these would be in addition to the 150 existing observation wells (para 2.13).
Monitoring would be done once a month during the first year after sinking
and quarterly thereafter. During negotiations assurances were obtained
that such observation wells would be established and monitored. Until the
additional data referred to above becomes available, it is recommended that,
as a precautionary measure, the minimum distance between each shallow tube-
well should be 300 m with the exception of Rohtak district (para 2.13) where
it should be 500 m.
3.06      The Project would also help finance about 75 sprinkler irrigation
sets (Annex 1), for which IDA contribution would amount to about US$130,000.
Progressive farmers, particularly in sandy soils with undulating topography,
have pioneered in this development and the GOI and State Government are
jointly financing a small project covering 25 sets in 1971. In these areas
irrigation is essential, and can be done either by sprinkler or surface



- 1.0 -
irrigation.  Surface irrigarion would irivol]ve costly land levelling (up to
Rs 7,500 per ha) and because of the hiigh seepage loss would necessitate
additional wells (Rs 1,600 per ha), whereas sprinkler irrigation requires a
total investment of only Rs 2,500 per ha, The Project would be limited to
specially selected areas in Lhe southwest of the State (see Map). Finance
for this part of the Project wqould be only through PLMBs because of its
special character. The SCO would specially train two officers for this
development and ar assurance to this effect was obtained.
Mechanization
3.07      Loans for mechanizationi would be for imported tractors (about
6,000), tractor implements and trailers (about 21,000), self-propelled
harvesting combines (about 20) and tractor drawn harvesters (about 100).  It
has been estimated that farmners' demand for tractors would be about two-
thirds in the 25-45 hp range and one-third in the 46-55 hp range. The
higher-powered tractor unit is included to meet the need for greater horse-
power availability on farms with increasing mechanization requirements,
particularly in those areas -where wheat planting follows rice harvesting
and for farmers or cont-ractors using more sophisticated implements such as
tractor drawn harvesters.
3.08      In order to obtain the maximum economic use of tractors, ARC
would ensure that lending baaks would apply as a norm for appraisal, the
applicant's ability to denionstrate Lhat the tractor would be used to crop
not less than 40 ha per vJear oi for 1,000 hours of productive agricultural
work per year.  Such criteria would apply to the applicant's own land, or
to the land of other farmers (through custom work) or a combination of
both.
3.09      Investments in tractor implements would include disc harrows and
ploughs, mould-board ploughs, spri:ng-tine cuLtivators, seed and fertilizer
drills, levelling b4.ades, tractor-nmounted power sprayers and trailers.
In order Lo ensure maxmunum ;ractor: utilization and economic benefits, it
is essential -Chat tractor owners should also possess at least the basic
tillage implements..  Because oL the short period between the kharif harvest
and rabi planting (para 2.14) the sharing of such implements is often not
practicable. Accordingly, under the Project, all farmers or contractors
would be required to have at least three implements for use with their
tractors and this would be part of the appraisal criteria to be applied
(Schedule A). Applicants would also be required to purchase post-warranty
service on tractors for the life oJf the loan.
3.1.0     Investments in harvesting machinery, comprising about 20 self-
propelled combines and about 100 tractor drawn harvesters, would extend
mechanized harvesting which recent Punjab pilot projects have proved to
be both practicable and beneficial. Loan applicants for self-propelled
combines would be required to give evidence of an assured workload of at
least 200 ha per unit per annum, and for tractor drawn harvesters of 100 ha
per annum. The total area harvested would therefore be a minimum of about
14,000 ha out of a total cropped area of 5 million ha and even if this was



- 11 -
doubled it would cause no major labor displacement. Prospective borrowers
would be farmers, contractors and HAIC; the last already provides farm custom
services. In order to permit worthwhile participation by private contractors,
it is envisaged that HAIC investment in these items would be limited to 10
self-propelled combines and 50 tractor drawn harvesters and during negotia-
tions an assurance to this effect was obtained.
3.11      The Project would also include provision for an initial spare
parts set of 15% of CIF value for tractors, self-propelled combines and
tractor drawn harvesters.
C.  Cost Estimates and Financing
Project Cost
3.12      Total Project cost is estimated at Rs 333.9 million (US$44.5
million) of which 48%, Rs 159.1 million (US$21.2 million) would be foreign
exchange. Cost estimates and foreign exchange requirements are:

/2   Dealers pay in cash on delivery of spares.  As a local currency
contribution for minor irrigation investments, GOI would make available
to ARC the equivalent in rupees of the amount disbursed by IDA in foreign
currency for spares.
IDA contribution would be US$25.0 million or Rs 187.7 million (56% of Project
cost) covering foreign exchange cost (US$21.2 million) and, in addition,
about: one-third of local costs in case of minor irrigation (US$3.8 million).
The t:ransfer by GO0 to ARC of the amount for spare parts (Rs 20.2 million)
would increase IDA contribution to local costs of minor irrigation to about
56%.
3.14      Farmers would contribute at least 20% of total investment cost in
case of minor irrigation; with the exception of small farmers (as defined
by ARC) who would contribute 10% for tubewell investments costing less than
Rs 10,000 each; 25% would be the down-payment for farmers or contractors in
case of mechanization investments. Repayment period of loans would not
exceed seven years (including one year of grace in the case of minor irriga-
tion) with the exceptions of self-propelled combines where the repayment
period would not exceed five years and tubewell loans for small farmers when
the repayment period would not exceed nine years. The IDA credit would be



- 13 -
on normal terms to GOI which would make the proceeds available to ARC, repay-
able at the end of nine years at an interest rate of 5% per annum less 1/4
of 1% rebate for prompt payment. GOI would bear the exchange risk. ARC
would on-lend the proceeds of the credit to the SLMB and participating com-
mercial banks (para 4.01) at an interest rate of 6-1/2% per annum computed
on outstanding indebtness. SLMB would in turn on-lend to its federated PLMBs
at 7-1/2% per annum which would lend, like commercial banks, to farmers and
contractors under the Project, at 9% per annum. Assurances on these arrange-
ments were obtained during negotiations.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
3.15      Sinking of shallow tubewells and installing of sprinkler irrigation
sets would involve small and labor intensive work on individual farms and
would not, therefore, lend itself to international competitive bidding.
Adequate well drilling contract services are available within the State.
3.16      Tractors, including an initial set of spare parts, would be imported,
but imports of makes would be limited to those which are from Bank-member
countries (and Switzerland) and have either manufacturing facilities in
India or have been licensed to manufacture by GOI. Five firms have been
approved as eligible for importing under this Project and a further seven
applications are under consideration (Annex 2).
3.17      The method of tractor procurement proposed follows the arrange-
ments agreed for the Gujarat, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh credit projects
and would combine bulk purchase based on farmers' demands with sales effected
through the normal dealership system (Annex 6). Arrangements would include
the establishment of a committee with representatives of GOI, the State
Government and ARC which would, in consultation with IDA, direct the
procurement of tractors (and other goods - paras 3.18 and 3.19). Organi-
zational responsibility would rest with Haryana Agro-Industries Corporation
(HAIC) (Annex 7), working under the direction of this committee, and it would
be responsible for obtaining price quotations from overseas suppliers in
Bank-member countries and Switzerland representing firms authorized to manu-
facture tractors in India at the time of procurement. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that tractors would be procured only in accord-
ance with these procedures.
3.18      Self-propelled combines (which are presently not manufactured in
India) and tractor drawn harvesters (which are) would be procured by inter-
national competitive bidding, with a level of preference of 15% or prevailing
custom duties (presently 27-1/2%), whichever is lower, applying to Indian
suppliers. Bids would only be sought against approved loan applications for
these items which would then be bulked to a value of at least US$100,000
equivalent for purchase by dealers (Annex 6). Assurances were obtained on this
matter during negotiations.



- 14 -
3.19      Tractor implements, including trailers, would be supplied from
Indian manufacturers. Their capacity is considered adequate to meet Project
requirements and prices are reasonable, but there is a shortage of certain
implement components requiring hard steel. Accordingly assurances were
obtained that GOI would make available in good time sufficient hard steel
of the proper quality for use in manufacturing plough bottoms, discs and
springs needed for the implements required under the Project.
3.20      Initial spare parts for tractors and harvesters (at 15% of the
CIF value) would be imported under the Project. Additionally, it would
be agreed that annually over the succeeding four years after disbursement,
GOI would make available foreign exchange for spare parts for each make of
tractor and harvester imported under the Project, equal to 10% of their CIF
prices or such other percentage as agreed between GOI and IDA from time to
time.
Disbursement
3.21      IDA disbursements are expected to extend over 3-1/2 years
(Annex 8) and would cover the CIF cost of tractors, initial tractor spare
parts, self-propelled combines and tractor drawn harvesters and initial
spare parts. If tractor drawn harvesters were supplied by Indian firms,
disbursement would cover ex-factory cost. Disbursements would be 46% of
loans disbursed for minor irrigation against appropriate statements.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Introduction
4.01      Several financing institutions would be involved in the Project
(para 3.14). Primary responsibility for Project implementationwould rest
with ARC which would control the lending operations of SLMB and participating
conmercial banks. Coordination and assistance at technical level are given
by a committee established by the State Government and by a project officer,
supported by a staff of technicians, provided by the Government.
Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC)
4.02      ARC has been the channel for three IDA agricultural Credit proj-
ects, in Gujarat, Punjab, and Andhra Pradesh. It is, therefore, well-known
to IDA and is considered a suitable institution for the overall administration
of this Project. It is described in detail in Annex 3.
4.03      The only major change in ARC's lending policy since the appraisal
of the Andhra Pradesh Project has been an increase in its lending rate from
6 to 6-1/2% per annum. There has been no change in the staffing position.
A medium-term staff development program has been prepared by ARC at the
request of IDA.



- 15 -
4.04      ARC would ensure that all lending banks follow policies and
procedures agreed with IDA (Schedule A). Loan agreements, acceptable to
IDA, would be entered into between GOI and ARC (this agreement incorporat-
ing the terms and conditions specified in para 3.14) and between ARC and
SLMB (which would incorporate the revised SLMB lending procedures detailed
in Appendix 4-5) and the execution of such agreements would be a condition
of credit effectiveness. ARC would also enter into loan agreements, accept-
able to IDA, with participating commercial banks.
4.05      ARC would be responsible for selecting the commercial banks which
could satisfy its criteria for participation in the Project. However, such
banks would not participate in lending for sprinkler irrigation as the
scheme is small and appraisal and supervision are closely related to
government trained extension services. Assurances were obtained that
commercial banks would be invited to participate in the Project.
4.06      ARC would instruct participating commercial banks to maintain
separate accounts for Project lending and would ensure that such accounts
were audited by auditors acceptable to IDA (para 4.17). ARC's own auditor:;
would continue to be subject to IDA approval.
Haryana State Cooperative Land Mortgage Bank (SLMB)
Organization and Management
4.07      The SLMB (Annex 4) was registered on October 17, 1966, on the
creation of the State of Haryana out of a reorganized State of Punjab. It
is an apex organization for a network of 23 Primary Land Mortgage Banks
(PLMBs). Since PLMBs can only borrow from the SLMB, which also provides
all PLMB staff on secondment, the SLMB and its federated primaries have
an operational relationship similar to that of a bank head office to its
branches.
4.08      SLMB's operations are regulated by the Cooperative Land Mortgage
Banks Act, 1957 and the Cooperative Societies Act, 1961. Its 15-member
Board consists of 10 members elected by PLMBs, three nominated by the State
Government and one each nominated by the State Cooperative Bank and the
Registrar of Cooperatives. The Board, which works through a nine-man
Executive Committee, appoints the Secretary (subject to the approval of the
Registrar of Cooperatives), who is the chief executive. He is assisted by
two assistant secretaries and a staff of 245, including those on secondment
to PLMBs. The PLMBs, with a total voting membership of some 40,000, also
elect their own committees which control their operations whilst the managers
(on secondment from SLMB) are the chief executive officers.
4.09      As elsewhere in India, SLMB's operations have previously been
concerned with loans based on the value of collateral instead of on devel-
opment criteria. A technical section is, therefore, being established in
the SLMB consisting of an agricultural economist, a chief inspecting officer,
and two inspecting officers, to be responsible for the overall guidance,
control, and training of the Land Valuation Officers (LVOs). The two
inspecting officers are already in post. In addition, each PLMB would be



- 16 -
provided with a technical officer ( a graduate in economics or agriculture)
who would be in overall charge of loan appraisals at primary level. The
PLMB managerial staff vwould also be strengthened and steps are being taken to
recruit 17 more highly-qualified managers. Six such appointments have
already been made. Assurances were obtained that SLMB would appoint an
agricultural economist and a chief inspecting officer and this would be a
condition of Project effectiveness. Assurances were also obtained that
each PLMB (23) would be provided .with a qualified manager and a technical
officer within 12 months of Project effectiveness.
Resources
4.10      The SLMB derives its resources from share capital contributed by
PLMBs and the State Government; the issue of ordinary, rural and special
debentures; and short-term borrowing from the State Cooperative Bank and
commercial banks (Annex 5). As at June 30, 1970: paid-up share capital
amounted to Rs 11.7 million (US$1.6 million) of which the State Government's
contribution was Rs 3.5 million (US$0.5 million) or about 30%; ordinary
debentures outstanding were Rs 90.4 million (US$12 million); rural debentures
Rs 2.4 million (US$0.3 million); and special debentures Rs 64.9 million
(US$8.6 million). Borrowings may not exceed 25 times the paid-up capital
plus reserves.
4.11      The main sources of funds of PLMBs are members' share capital
(each borrower must own share capital equal to 5% of loans), loans from
the SLMB, and undistributed profits. As at June 30, 1970, total share
capital of all 23 PLMBs amounted to Rs 11 million (US$1.5 million) whilst
total outstanding borrowings from SLMB amounted to Rs 156.6 million (US$21
million). Borrowings may not exceed 25 times the paid-up share capital.
Operational Results
4.12      The SLMB's loan portfolio has increased from Rs 16 million (US$2
million) as at June 30, 1967 to Rs 157 million (US$20 million as at June 30,
1970 whilst the number of loans approved increased from 1,000 in 1966/67 to
11,000 in 1969/70. Loans for minor irrigation represent about 69% of total
portfolio and farm machinery loans 25%. Since SLMB presently charges
PLMBs 6-3/4% per annum, its spread between borrowing and lending rates is
very narrow, averaging less than 3/4%. Nevertheless, it has made profits
(RS 738,000 or US$100,000 for 1969/70) and as at June 30, 1970 reserves and
undistributed profits amounted to Rs 1.5 million (1% of loan portfolio).
ARC's lending rate to SLMB has recently been increased from 6% to 6-1/2% per
annum and the lending rate to farmers will be increased from 8-1/4% to 9%
per annum (para 4.03). The additional 1/4% resulting from these adjustments
wou:Ld accrue to SIMB (giving it a Spread of 1%) to help meet the expenses
of the newly established technical section (para 4.09). The collection
rate for loans to PLMBs is 100%.
4.13      Operating results of PLMBs vary according to their size and location,
but all are profit earning. Collectively their profits are larger than those
of SLMB (their lending margin is 1-1/2%), Rs 350,000 (US$50,000) in 1968/69
compared with SLMB's Rs 275,000 (US$37,000). Loans are well secured and
overdues negligible, less than 1% overall.

Accounts and Auditing
4.14      The accounting system has been adequate to cope with the volume
of business so far, but the increase envisaged would require some improve-
ments to be made. The SLMB, in conjunction with the State Government, has
established a committee which is reviewing procedures and systems but in
the meantime, a post of Assistant Secretary (Accounts) has been created and
recruitment of a qualified accountant is underway. The accounts of the SLMB
and PLMBs are audited by independent auditors from the State Cooperative
Department, which is the usual Indian practice, and the audit is satisfactory.
Assurances were obtained that the accounts of SLMB and PLMBs would con-
tinue to be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.
Commercial Banks
4.15      There are 20 commercial banks operating in Haryana of which 13
are nationalized (Annex 5). Together they provide about 219 branches
throughout the State, the most important being the State Bank of India
(62 branches), the Punjab National Bank (45) and the Central Bank of India
(37).
4.16      Until recently, as elsewhere in India, commercial bank lending to
agriculture was very small. However, with the encouragement of GOI it is
steadily increasing, and during 1968/69 twelve banks advanced between them
Rs 2 million (US$270,000) for agricultural inputs, Rs 2.2 million (US$290,000)
for tractors, and Rs 4 million (US$540,000) for tubewells. Banks normally
require a downpayment by borrowers of between 25 and 33-1/3% and security
requirements consist of a charge on equipment purchased and usually, though
not invariably, a mortgage over land to the extent of double the amount of
the loan. Interest rates range from 8-1/2 to 9-1/2% per annum and repayment
is usually required within five years.
4.17      Commercial banks would be included among the lending institutions
eligible for ARC refinancing under the Project with the exception of
investments in sprinkler irrigation (para 4.05). Commercial bank partici-
pation would provide farmers with an alternative source of loans outside
the PLMBs, thus giving a degree of competition in service, would increase
the number and coverage of banks available for Project lending and would
utilize the services of the technical staffs which several of the banks are
now engaging. Such banks would, however, be required to agree that they
would accept the terms laid down by ARC for Project loans and would apply
this same criteria and interest rates to all lending for similar purposes.
They would also be required to agree to maintain separate accounts for
Project funds and such accounts would be subject to audit by auditors accept-
able to ARC and IDA (para 4.06).
Haryana Agro-Industries Corporation Ltd. (HAIC)
4.18      HAIC's organizational role in the Project would provide the
mechanism required to carry out the various procedures involved in establish-
ing farmers' tractor requirements and arranging for the procurement of
goods under the Project. In all deliberative matters, HAIC would be under



- 18 -
the direction of the committee to be established for the purpose (para 3.17)
and there would, therefore, be no conflict of interest if a tractor manu-
facl:urer decided to use its facilities as distributing agent.
Lending Policies and Terms
4.19      Loans would conform with agreed terms and appraisal criteria
(paras 3.03 through 3.10 and Schedule A) and investments would be evaluated
in terms of incremental returns resulting from the additional investments
in accordance with evaluation methods developed by ARC. Interest rates,
repayment periods, and farmers' contributions would be as specified in
para 3.14.
4.20)     Assurances on the above were obtained.  In addition, assurances
were also obtained that for all similar types of lending participating
banks (SLMB, PLMBs, and commercial banks) would apply the same criteria as
for Project loans and would not charge lower interest rates, except for
schemes submitted tnder the aegis of the Small Farmers Development Agency
in Haryana.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, PRICES AND FARMERS' BENEFITS
Procluction
5.01      Under the Project, about 69,000 ha would be irrigated which would
enable about 11,000 farmers to increase their cropping intensity and obtain
more reliable yields from areas which presently depend on uncertain rainfall.
Tractors supplied under the Project would increase cropping intensity on
about 120,000 ha, providing power needed for 200,000 - 300,000 ha of crops
(including custom work). At prevailing prices farmers are likely to expand
crop acreages and production in the direction of foodgrains, cotton and
sugaLrcane. On this basis the increase in production (at full development)
could well be about 215,000 tons of foodgrains (mainly wheat), 67,500 tons
of seed cotton, and 780,000 tons of sugarcane (Annex 9). Price changes
(para 5.03) could, however, alter the crop mix and consequently incremental
production.
Marketing
5.02      The Haryana Agricultural Marketing Board is mainly responsible for
surplus foodgrain storage and marketing in Haryana. It would handle most
of the incremental production of foodgrains arising out of the Project.
This increment, estimated at full development at about 215,000 tons annually,
is about 5% of the present production in Haryana of about 4.5 million tons
(1969/70). As Haryana's production exceeds the State's domestic consumption,
increased output would be consumed in foodgrain deficit States within India.
In Haryana, 60 regulated markets have been established, which levy a fee of
1%, but the farmer receives a regulated price and does not have to sell to
middlemen. Considerable investments in storage facilities are planned
within the fourth Five-Year Plan; IDA is considering financial assistance
for a wheat storage project in India of which a large part would be in Har-
yana. With the planned grain storage investments, the existing marketing
organizations would be able to handle estimated production increases.



- 19 -
Prices
5.03       GOI expects that self-sufficiency in foodgrains in India would be
reached within this decade. While it remains India's policy to encourage
agricultural production through price incentives, a substantial increase
in its foodgrain production would lead to a decline in prices. Predicted
world market prices of wheat in 1975, for example, are about 35% lower than
present prices in llaryana. 1/ Uncertainties over future food policy in India
make price forecasting in general very difficult, but the sensitivity of
financial returns to farmers of Project investments have been tested (para
5.04).
Farmers' Benefits
5.04      On the basis of investment costs, estimated yields and present
prices, detailed in five models (Annex 10), farm family incomes excluding
the wages of family labor but after debt service would increase as follows:

These five illustrative types of various farm enterprises show that substan-
tial increases in the net incomes of such farmers or group of farmers would
result from the proposed investments when combined with the use of improved

seeds, fertilizer, assured water supply and other annual inputs at levels
which can reasonably be expected. On moderately well-managed farms, the
financial rate of return is estimated to range from 39 to 66% at present
prices and costs for minor irrigation investments, and to be about 40% in
the case of mechanization (Annex 11). At world market prices, the financial
rate of return to farmers would drop sharply to a range of 22-27% for minor
irrigation and 15% for tractors but would still be adequate. The key factor
accounting for this is the high current market price for wheat which is priced
at about 50% above world market prices.
5.05      At presently contemplated levels of mechanization (para 2.15),
economic benefits would justify further investments in tractors. Possibili-
ties for crop intensification could generate sufficient additional employ-
merit to more than offset the labor displacing effects of proposed levels of
mechanization which would in turn result in a more even spread of employment
through the year. At prevailing prices the real danger is that individual
farmers may underutilize their tractors since they can achieve high financial
returns with low levels of utilization. Higher tractor prices would dis-
courage investment in tractors unless high levels of utilization could be
achieved (Annex 2). IDA has, therefore, made representations to GOI on
several occasions and GOI is discussing with GATT possibilities of release
from arrangements binding tractors at a zero import duty. In the interim
there continues to be an active secondhand trade in tractors at premium
prices especially of tractors imported from Western countries.
5.06      Total government revenue from land tax and water charges in
1969 averaged only Rs 2.01 (US$0.27) per ha. Since this is not related to
farmers' actual net income or water use the Project would not generate any
additional direct tax. Indirect tax benefits would accrue to GOI and State
Government through a tax levied on tractor and machinery sales (at present
6%) which is estimated to bring in about Rs 14 million.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The Project would benefit at least 20,000 Haryana farmers invest-
ing in minor irrigation and farm mechanization including many small farmers
who would be able to take advantage of tractor custom services and tubewell
facilities.  Benefits to the Indian economy would be: first, a higher cropping
intensity, resulting from investments in minor irrigation and mechanization,
which would increase the production of foodgrains and other commercial crops
(para 5.01); second, the availability of more water and power would result
in a shift in the cropping pattern toward more valuable and labor intensive
crops (e.g. pulses to wheat); third, higher yields would be obtained by
applying reliable irrigation facilities and timely cultivation practices
(through mechanization) so enabling better use of available high yielding
varieties and fertilizers. Since yields would no longer depend on uncertain
rainfall, production would not fluctuate so widely as in the past. Since
India is at present not self-sufficient in foodgrains, vegetable oils and
cotton increased production of these commodities would result in foreign
exchange savings. Gross production value of crops at full production would
increase by about US$32 million equivalent annually.



- 21 -
6.02      The rate of return to the economy would be high if the value of
foodgrains is calculated on present prices, but these are high compared
with world market prices and at the existing exchange rate. Wheat prices,
for example, the main cash crop grown by Project farmers are 50% above
predicted world market prices for 1975. Making the appropriate adjustments
in respect of taxes, and taking expected world market prices, the overall
rate of return to the economy would be in the range of 22 to 27% for irrigation
and 15%". for mechanization. A sensitivity test using a rate of exchange which
reflects more closely the effective cost of imports (which normally bear a
duty of 27.5%) gives economic rates of return ranging from 29 to 35% for
irrigation and 17% for mechanization.
6.03      In calculating Project returns, secondary benefits such as the
domestic value added by processing project products have not been taken into
account. In addition, there would be other indirect benefits which are
difficult to quantify, such as incremental production from farm custom work,
the demonstration effect on other farmers, the strengthening of lending ins-
titutions and the Government Soil Conservation Organization, and reinvestments
of farmers' income in agriculture. Further, increased double cropping and
shifts to more labor intensive crops would mean more year-round employment
for farm workers. Though not quantifiable, these factors would enhance the
Project's already adequate economic justification.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, the following main assurances were obtained:
(a) tractors and their initial spare parts would be imported
on the basis of farmers' choice and through arrangements
for bulk procurement described in Annex 6 (para 3.17);
(b) self-propelled combines and tractor drawn harvesters and
initial spare parts would be procured through international
competitive bidding (Indian suppliers having, in respect
of harvesters, a 15% preference or prevailing custom duties
whichever is lower), through arrangements for bulk procurement
described in Annex 6 (para 3.18);
(c) lending banks would follow agreed lending policies and
procedures as set out in Schedule A, (para 4.04); and
(d) the SLMB would provide each PLMB with a qualified manager
and technical officer within 12 months of Project effectiveness
(para 4.09).
7.02      Conditions of credit effectiveness would be:
(a) the execution of subsidiary loan agreements between GOI
and ARC and ARC and SLMB acceptable to IDA (para 4.04); and



- 22 -
(b) the appointment by SLMB of an agricultural economist and
a chief inspecting office (para 4.09).
7.03      The proposed Project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$25.0
million under normal IDA terms.

HARYANA AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
MINOR IRRIGATION
A. Geologic and Hydrologic Conditions in Haryana
1.        The State of Haryana is situated on the Indo-Gangetic plain formed
by the deposition of alluvial sediments principally by streams draining the
Himalaya Mountains on the north. The Himalayan uplift created a depression
between the mountains and the Deccan Plateau in the south; hence, streams
from both north and south have contributed to filling the depression. Geo-
physical surveys indicate that the floor of the depression included irreg-
ularities and ridges. A buried ridge with a northwest strike extends under
the plain in Haryana towards the Salt Range in West Pakistan. This ridge
may have obstructed the movement of groundwater from the high rainfall areas
to the north thus contributing to saline and waterlogged conditions in some
parts of the central plain. The Siwalik hills border the northeast portion
of Harvana and streams draining this area undoubtedly provide a significant
recharge to the groundwater reservoir underlying the plain. The Aravalli
hills are composed of rocks of Pre-Cambrian age and outcrop in parts of
Hissar, Mohindergarh and Gurgaon Districts. In some places these hills are
drained by streams running in a northeasterly direction.
2.        The alluvial deposits range in age from Pleistocene to recent and
vary in thickness up to 1,200 m 1/. The deposits consist of silts, sands and
clays with occasional gravel beds. Irregular concretions of calcareous
matter which are found in the older deposits are referred to as Kankar.
3.        Precipitation decreases from the northeast in Ambala District where
it averages about 1,200 mm annually to the southwest in Hissar District
where in some places it is less than 300 mm.  Over 70 percent of the rain-
fall occurs during the moonsoon season of July, August, and September, although
some precipitation usually occurs during January and February. The follow-
ing table gives the average annual precipitation for each District for the
period 1942-48 to 1968-69:

4.        The Jamuna River forms the western boundary of the State and
supplies a large portion of the water used for irrigation. Together wiSh
the Bhakra system these streams supply an average of about 10 billion m
annually to the State. A substantial increase in the quantity of water
available for irrigation is anticipated when the Ravi-Beas diversion scheme
is completed. The additional water supply will be diverted to Mohindergarh
through the existing Dadri channels and Dadri Lift Scheme; to Gurgaon Dis-
trcit: through the Gurgaon Canal and Rewari Lift Scheme; to Hissar District
through the existing Bhakra Canal System, Jui Lift Scheme and Loharu Lift
Schem.e. The additional canal water will provide an important new source
of water for lands not presently irrigated and supplemental supply for lands
now short of water. In addition, the recharge to the groundwater reservoir
will be significantly increased.
5.        The Ghaggar River forms the northern boundary of the State.  It
has a perennial flow in the upper reaches, but only in monsoon season does
its flows reach the western boundary. Nevertheless, it contributes signi-
ficant quantities of water for irrigation as well as to groundwater recharge
which is of good quality.
6.        Except for two large tracts of .oam, most soils of the State are
classified as sandy loam or loamy sand. One tract of loam includes blocks
of Mehan, Rohtak, Gohana, Mudlana and Kathura. The other includes blocks
of Assandh, Rajaund, Pundri, Kaithal, Guhla, Nissong, Nilokheri, Thanesar,
Shahabad, Ladwa, Karnal and Barara.
7.        In the southiern part of the State, wind erosion is prevalent and
in places sand dunes of varying magnitude have formed which make cultivation
difficult. In the sand dune areas gravity irrigation is especially diffi-
cult as the light textured soils are conducive to high seepage losses from
watercourses and from irrigation applications. Becausl of low waterholding
capacity of the soils frequent applications are required.
B.  Present Groundwater Development
8.        In 1968/69, about 1.3 million ha were irrigated in laryana of
which 907,000 ha were supplied by canals and 405,000 ha from wells and other
minor sources. The following table gives details by District:

9.        Irrigation from wells is not new to Haryana.  From time immemorial
Persian wheels and "charsa" 1/ irrigation have been practiced, but the area
irrigated in this manner was usually less than 0.4 ha per well. With the
availability of centrifugal pumps and electric or diesel power much more
land could be served. By 1970 some 50,000 tubewells were in operation,
which utilized an estimated 3.9 billion m3 of groundwater.
10.       The aquifers supplying the shallow tubewells in Haryana range in
texture from fine to coarse sand. Two distinct types of tubewell construc-
tion have, therefore, been developed. In one type a "coir" strainer, made
of coconut fiber, is used and in the other type no strainer is used but a
cavity is developed around the open end of the casing. Both are drilled by
hand and are connected directly to a centrifugal pump. Wells are drilled
by local "Mistries" who have gained considerable knowledge of local con-
ditions and are skilled in the art of drilling under the prevailing condi-
tions. Cost estimates of typical tubewells are given in Appendix 1-1. Well
discharge varies from 0.3 to 0.5 cusecs from depths ranging from about 20
to 50 m. Where the well cannot be located on the highest point on the farm
water must be conveyed from the pump in a lined (or "pucca") channel or
pipe to serve the commanded area. For this reason the cost of the "pucca"
channel is included in the cost of the tubewell. The principal cause of
tubewell failure in Haryana is inadequate length of blank casing in tubewells
equipped witlh strainers. The "coir" strainers function satisfactorily for
a period exceeding 7 years if they are in the zone of saturation at all
times. Deterioration seems to occur, however, if the strainers are subjected
alternately to saturated and unsaturated conditions. The SCO should advise
on placement of strainers and amount of blank casing needed for such wells.

C. Proposed Croundwater Development
Tubewells
11.       The Project would increase minor irrigation facilities by the
installation of about 11,000 tubewells together with electric pumps (in-
cluding electrical connections not exceeding Fs 500 per well) and "pucca"
channels where needed. These wells would irrigate about 69,000 ha. The
Prc,ject would also include financing for about 75 sprinkler irrigations sets
which is discussed below (para 12).  The Project would include tubewells in
all Districts of Haryana except Mohindergarh but this District is included
in the area to be irrigated by sprinkler. The following table shows the
nup er of tue-T-Flls incl'ded  in the Project by District:

Total                    11,000
Sprinkler Irrigation
12.        Over the last decade, there has been a progressive growth in the
use of sprinkler irrigation in India, but, until recently, its use has been
confined mostly to orchard and plantation crops. Sprinkler irrigation
equipment is manufactured in India by four firms. One of these firms
(Premier Irrigation Equipment Ltd. Calcutta), is also the main source of
searn-welded aluminum tubing, but extruded aluminum pipes are also produced
by Indian Aluminum Company. Supplies are adequate and the quality of the
equipment is satisfactory and prices reasonable by international standards.
13.       Over large parts of Haryana, and in particular in the southwest
of the State (Curgaon, Mohindergarh and Hissar districts - see map) con-
ditions favor the use of sprinkler irrigation. In these areas, alluvial
plains alternate with light sandy undulations, restricting the effective
command area of a tubewell under normal flow irrigation arrangements.
14.       To explore alternative solutions to this type of problem area,
GOT has established, with technical assistance from U.S.A.T.D., four
regional soil and water mnnagement pilot projects of which that at Patiala,
Punjab, is operating under conditions similar to those of Haryana. In this



ANNEX 1
Page 5
project, an attempt is being made to evaluate such alternative solutions
as land levelling, surface irrigation with channel lining, and/or under-
ground low pressure pipes, and sprinkler irrigation systems.
15.       Already, however, a few farmers in Haryana have installed
sprinkler systems on their own account. For larger-scale demonstration
purposes, during the three years 1971/72 to 1973/74 (financed partly by
GOI and partly by State Government funds), 25 sprinkler irrigation sets
will be installed, under the supervision of the SCO, in eight prescribed
blocks of Hissar, Mohindergarh and Gurgaon districts, on farms of not less
than 8 ha already possessing a tubewell. These are in addition to the
75 sets proposed under the Project.
16.       At the end of the demonstration period, the farmer will be given
the option of purchasing the equipment installed by SCO and, where neces-
sary, will be assisted in obtaining a loan from the SLMB for this purpose.
If he does not wish to make this investment, the apparatus will be removed
for reuse on another farm.
Factors Favoring the Adoption of Sprinkler Irrigation in Haryana
17.       Present indications are that, under characteristic topographical
conditions in Haryana, with slopes frequently exceeding 5%, land levelling
costs (up to Rs 7,500 per ha) exceed the investment costs of sprinkler irri-
gation (Rs 2,500 per ha). Moreover, because of the permeability of the
soils water losses are less with sprinklers than with channel irrigation even
though the channels are lined. Additional investments in wells would also be
required (Rs 1,600 per ha) to cover the same area by surface irrigation.
Labor costs are lower under sprinkler irrigation systems and irrigation
efficiency higher. This is partly due to the better uniformity of application
(often resulting in higher yields) and the likelihood of less spillage loss.
These conclusions are illustrated in Annex 9. The model shows that a holding
of 10 ha with a tubewell able to irrigate effectively only 3 ha by surface
water, can cover the whole of the area under sprinklers because of the more
efficient use of the water. Costs have been conservatively calculated to
include a reservoir to provide sufficient water as a safeguard against
variations in tubewell discharge, together with a new pump to operate the
sprinkler system.
18.       Moreover, it has to be borne in mind that land levelling involves
a period of lower yields until the fertility of the top soil is built up,
and flow irrigation involves loss of cultivated area for channelling pur-
poses, unless underground piping is installed.
Special Considerations
19.       Sprinkler irrigation is a relatively sophisticated type of irri-
gation that calls for specialist advice as to the best design/layout,
wlhich needs to be tailored to the requirements of an individual farm, and
also for its subsequent operation. Two officers of SCO would receive the
necessary additional technical training at the GOI Regional Soil and Water
management Pilot Project at Patiala.

D. Factors Affecting Project Formulation
Recharge of Groundwater
20.       The amount of groundwater that can be developed in Hlaryana is
limited mainly by the magnitude of recharge to the aquifers supplying the
wells. The recharge is closely related to rainfall and canal irrigation.
In the northeastern part of the State (Ambala District) the average annual
precipitation is about 1,200 mm and recharge is substantial both bv
precipitation directly on the area and by runoff from ,treams draining the
Siwalik hills.  The Cheturvedi formula, R    2(R-15)   , where R  = re-
charge per annum and R = average annual rRinfall, gives an estimRte of
recharge from precipitation. Recharge is also provided by such streams
as the Ghagger and Jamuna Rivers and other perennial and ephemeral streams.
21.       Even though surface water supplies are insufficient to meet the
full irrigation requirements of the areas commanded, the recharge associated
with canal irrigation is large. In most such areas waterlogging either
has already occurred or is imminent. Groundwater pumping in these areas
would not only provide water for irrigation, but would help prevent or
alLeviate waterlogging. A decline of the water table in areas threatened
with waterlogging would reduce nonbeneficial consumptive uses and thereby
make additional water available for crops.
22.       The total canal water presently available to Haryana is about
10 billion m3 annually, which is estimated to provide about 5.8 billion m
recharge. Assuming that this quantity was pumped on the farms, the
regenerated recharge would be about 2 billion m3. Thus, the total recharge
from canal irrigation with one recycling would be 7.8 billion m3, only   3
slightly less than the canal imports. Assuming an application of 6,000 m
per ha for the 0.4 million ha irrigated by wells in 1968/69, there would be
about 5 billion m3 of groundwater annually available for development.
Local Overdevelopment
23.       Local overdevelopment of the groundwater resources may occur
when the total withdrawal in any area exceeds the total recharge. As-
suaing an irrigation application of 24 inches (600 mm) of canal water and
a farm application efficiency of 60%, the ground water depletion for each
well serving 10 acres (4 ha) would be (24.0 - 9.6) x 10 = 12 acre feet
3                                      12
(15,000m ). Wells spaced 300 m could have an effective drawdown area of
about 7 ha and would require an annual recharge of about 2,000 m3 per ha to
avoid some degree of groundwater mining. This could be provided by precipi-
tation on the area and seepage losses from canals and distributaries. In
Rohtak District where canal irrigation is not so extensive, wells spaced at
500 m could have an effective area of drawdown of about 16 lia.3 For a well
serving 4 ha the required recharge per ha would be about 370 m .  This would
be provided by precipitation directly on the area and by infiltration from
ephemeral streams during the monsoon.



ANNEX 1
Page  7
24.       Spacing of wells cannot be accurately determined for any specific
area without detailed study of the hydrologic conditions affecting re-
charge and discharge of groundwater. For this reason, the SCO needs
strengthening which is discussed in section E of this Annex.  The minimum
spacing suggested above should be used pending the results of additional
studies resulting from the establishment of 300 observation wells in addi-
tion to the 150 or so being observed at present. A drawdown must be antici-
pated during years of less than normal precipitation. Some detailed studies
have been made bv the Geological Survev of India at the request of ARC and
suchl assistance should be requested by the SCO in the Project areas if needed.
W4ater Qualitv
25.       Data on quality of groundwater have been compiled by the
Haryana Department of Agriculture. Areas where salinity occurs have been
identified and no tubewells would be installed in such areas. 'The following
table shows the rating scheme in current use in the Agricultural Department,
which is satisfactory for the existing crop and soil conditions.

Note:
1.   The texture as indicated above refers to the predominant texture at
least in the upper one meter of the soil.
2.   If Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC) is above 2.5 in clay loam soil,
occasional application of gypsum will be needed.
3.   The soil should have unimpeded drainage with no problem of waterlogging.
E. Soil Conservation Or anization (SCO)
26.       The Department of Agriculture is divided into three parts:  (i)
Agricultural Extension; (ii) Soil and Water Conservation (of which the SCO
is a part); and (iii) Special Services. The SCO is charged with the develop-
ment of groundwater resources with the exception of deep tubewells which are



ANNEX 1
Page 8
the responsibility of the Minor Irrigation Corporation. It is the SCO which
will be concerned with the Project.
27.       For soil and water conservation work the State is divided into
two zones, each in charge of a Divisional Soil Conservation Officer each of
whom is supported by four Assistant Soil Conservation Officers and technical
staff. Total staff strength of SCO is presently about 200.
28.       The technical competence of SCO is satisfactory but in view of
the requirement to select 300 additional observation wells (making a total of
450) the present staff will need to be strengthened by about 20 technicians
with a bachelor degree in engineering or geology and preferably specialized
in groundwater hydrology. It would also be essential for at least two
officers to be trained in sprinkler irrigation techniques. Facilities for
such training are available at the GOI regional soil and water management
project at Patiala in Punjab.
29.       In view of abundant groundwater resources available in Hlaryana
and the often high water table, the SCO, suitably strengthened as proposed,
would provide adequate services for the Project.

HARYANA AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
FARM MECHANIZATION
A. TRACTOR ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
The Effects of Technological Changes in Agricultural Production
1.        The traditional technological production processes in Haryana
involved limited irrigation and the use of seeds that had little response
to fertilizer. Over a long period of operating under such constraints,
the Haryana farmer had evolved cropping patterns and input uses that
approached the optimum use of available resources, and his power require-
ments were met by human and animal power.
2.        This situation has been changed by the advent of the new tech-
nology. Tubewells have given farmers an assured supply of water under
their own control, i.e., applicable as and when they need it. With the
new high-yielding seed varieties come substantially increased production
opportunities, provided planting is timely and fertilizer is applied. The
new technology calls for a greatly increased supply of power on the farm.
Alternative Power Sources
3.        The Haryana farmer could meet this power need by increasing his
employment of labor or bullocks or by turning to tractor power. As
regards labor, compared with India as a whole, Haryana has a lower propor-
tion of agricultural laborers to cultivators - 1-10 against the all-India
average of 1-3, in spite of the fact that the net area sown per cultivator
in Haryana at 1.85 ha is higher than that for India as a whole (1.33 ha).
In the past, at times of peak labor requirement, particularly during the
harvest period, it was customary for gangs of laborers to come to Haryana,
especially from Rajasthan. Recently, however, with increased opportunities
following the expansion of irrigation in Rajasthan, this supply has not been
adequate. An indication of the sharp rise in the demand for labor is given
by the increase in agricultural wage rates between 1966 and 1969, by 40%.
Social constraints and the fact that times of peak demand for labor are
the same throughout northern India, severely limit the possibility of large-
scale labor movements.
4.        Increased animal power could be provided by breeding more bullocks
or importing bullocks from other States. However, increased use of bullock
power requires additional fodder production to feed draft animals, cutting
into marketable surpluses of fodder for dairy and livestock production or
preventing expansion of other higher value crops.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        In practice the Haryana farmers have tried to meet their increased
labor needs by using tractors. The main reasons advanced by farmers for
the extended use of mechanical power are that it permits timely planting of
rabi wheat after kharif crops (rice, cotton, and rape) and enables the area
sown to both kharif and rabi crops to be increased, because the land can
be prepared more speedily. In critical periods, a tractor can be worked 24
hours per day, whereas a pair of bullocks can only do 8 hours. The period
in which first crops must be harvested, land prepared and planting of
the second crop completed is extremely short witil peak power demands
occurring in May-June and October-December. With bullock power, it has
been possible to raise cropping intensities only by adding a short duration
crop or a crop requiring relatively little labor in the rotation 1/.
These are usually low-value crops.
Effects of Tractor Cultivation
6.        The argument against the introduction of mechanical power where
unemployment or underemployment exists is that it displaces labor with no
alternative work opportunity, thus aggravating the employment problem.
T'his argument is not valid in Haryana for a combination of reasons which are
both general in their application and peculiar to the situation there.
Although labor inputs per operation are reduced by mechlanization, the double-
cropping facilitated by speedier, more timely, preparation and harvesting,
and--less certainly--the increased yields per hectare resulting from timely
cultivation, help to counter any negative employment effect. This is further
offset by the changes in the cropping ratio towards higher value crops
which tractor cultivation facilitates. The introduction of tractors has
made it possible to shift cropping patterns to include a higher proportion
cf high value commercial crops.
7.        The extent to which cropping patterns have already changed in
Haryana is shown in Appendix 2-1. Taking the average of 1960/61 and 1965/66
as a base, and comparing this with the average for the three years 1966/67-
1968/69 (to even out annual fluctuations), the following sionificant cropping
pattern changes are apparent:
(a) The share of foodgrains went up from 43% to 47.4% of
the cropped area;
(b)  Wheat showed a rise from 15% to 13% of the cropped area;
(c)  Cotton area increased from 3.3% to 4.6% of the total
reflecting increased irrigation possibilities particularly
in Hissar district; and
1/   For example millets, rape or pulses could be followed by wheat; and
paddy or cotton could be followed by pulses or fodder; but very little
land could be prepared in time for double-cropping and most farmers
left some fallow land.



ANNEX 
Page 3
(d) Pulses have declined from 28% to 20.3%.
8.        In liaryana the observed unemplovment is seasonal in nature aris-
ing from the uneven demand for labor for crop cultivation. In the peak
cultivation periods there is an absolute shortage of labor. A review of the
most likelv cropping patterns to evolve, coupled with an increase in crop-
ping intensity from 140% to 180%, indicates that labor requirements would
increase by about 33%.  If mechanized land preparation operations are taken
into account, it is estimated that the increase would still be of the order
of 25%. This effect clearly interacts with the intensification and crop
ratio effects noted above. In addition, there will be a number of indirect
employment effects in the agricultural and other sectors, but particularly
influencing overall employment. The need for tractor maintenance and supply
services as well as increased factor and produce marketing facilities in use
have a positive influence on overall employment.
9.        The net effect of mechanization on total labor use is difficult
to quantify with any precision. At worst it is probably neutral in the
llaryana case, and up to the time when mechanical harvesting is introduced--
usually a late development--is likely to be positive. In Haryana there
is little risk of an unemployment and income distribution problem arising
however as 86% of farmers own all their farms or both own and rent, and
only 12% of the farm labor force is laborers. Should there be an increase
in leisure time at any phase of the development of mechanical cultivation
most of this will be captured, along with the enhanced incomes, by the
owner cultivators.
The Power Price Factor
10.       The optimum mix of power resources depends not only on the total
demand for power, but also on the relative prices of alternative power
sources. In relation to current wheat prices in India, tractors are in
general under-priced, and because of importation of Eastern bloc tractors
under trade agreements, normal hp/price relationships have been distorted.
As a result, even when it is under-utilized, investment in a tractor can
still yield satisfactory financial results. But this means that capital
- the most scarce resource - is being wasted. 1/
1/   The effect on scarce foreign exchange resources is not so marked.
Under the project proposals, foreign exchange costs attributable
to mechanization total US$20.9 million whereas net foreign exchange
savings because of increased wheat and rice production would run at
about US$18.0 million p.a. (all at current world price levels).



ANNEX 2
Page 4
11.       Any subsidization of the price of machinery will have two
important social effects. First it will tend to distort the farm power-
mix to the detriment of labor; secondly, such subsidization would favor
larger farm operators as the main users of mechanized power.
Tractor Price and Tractor Utilization Considerations
12.       The tractor model for this project (Farm Model V in Annex 10)
gives a financial rate of return of 40% on the basis of 1,000 hours of
tractor use per year on 40 cropped ha of irrigated land. If tractor
prices were increased by 20%, the financial rate of return would fall to
about 25%. However, this return is not strictly attributable to the tractor
alone, but reflects the better use of all inputs made possible by tractor
power.
13.       Assuming that, instead of buying a tractor himself, the farmer
has all tractor services provided by a contractor, and that these are
charged at current rates for normal tillaRe operations of Rs 15 per hour,
the financial rate of return on the tractor model goes up to more than 100%,
reflecting in part the more intensive tractor utilization achieved by the
contractor - see para 14 below. In practice, because he cannot rely on
getting contracting services as and when he needs them, the farmer prefers
to invest in a tractor himself in order to reduce uncertainty, just as he
prefers to invest in a tubewell rather than rely on other uncertain water
supply.
14.       The contractors'financial rate of return and on the assumption
that service charges remain constant at current levels, under varying levels
of investment costs and intensity of tractor utilization, is shown in
Appendix 2-2. This suggests that, at higher tractor prices, tractor utiliza-
tion must be of the order of 1,500 hours p. a. to yield a reasonable return
to the contractor.
15.       In order to prevent uneconomic utilization of scarce capital
resources, and to avoid artificially favouring mechanical power against
labor and large farmers against small, a proper relationship between tractor
and wheat prices is desirable. Since in the short run, until self-sufficiency
in foodgrain production is reached, it is unlikely that Indian wheat prices
will be reduced, there should be an increase in the selling price of tractors
to the farmer. Although, at present, under scarcity conditions, black market
"premia" increase the investment cost of a tractor to many farmers, this
will decrease as the supply position improves. Increases in the controlled
prices of locally produced tractors are currently under consideration by
GOI and negotiations are in train with GATT to permit import duties to be
levied by GOI on tractor imports.
16.       In the meantime, to avoid over-capitalization by farmers and promote
economic utilization of tractors, lending banks would be required under the
Project to apply as a norm for appraisal, the applicant's ability to



ANNEX 2
Page 5
demonstrate that the tractor would be used to crop not less than 40 ha per
year or for 1,000 hours of productive agricultural worlk per year. Such
criteria would apply to the applicant's oWIn land, or to the land of other
farmers (tlhrough custonm work) or a combination of both.
Tractor Supply
17.       The following table sets out thie supply position over the past
threc years, togethler with estimates of the tractor availability position in
India durinig the next five years (1970/71 to 1974/75):
Indian                                   Total gross
Year             Manufacture           Imports /1             New Supply
1967/68              11,394               5,500                  16,894
1968/69              15,466               4,276                  19,742
1969/70              17,099             10,473                   27,577
1970/71              20,000              10,000                  30,000

1972/73              26,500               7,000                  33,500

1974/75              34,000               3,000                  37,000
/1   Excluding imports under IDA credits, as these are earmarked for
specific States under credit projects.  As at December, 1970,
maximum limits for such tractor imports during 1971-74 amounted
to 11,700 made up as follows;
Gujarat                     2,200
Punjab                      8,000
Andhra Pradesh              1,500
11,700
18.       There are at present six Indian tractor plants, four of which
manufacture in association with companies in Bank member countries.  In
addition, GOI has given approval for the establishment of one other manu-
facturing plant involving association witlh a company in a Bank member coun-
try, and was considering proposals for establishing further plants including
seven which would involve collaboration with Bank member countries, to
bring the aggregate additional licensed capacity to over 100,000 tractors
per annum. Hitherto mainly because of component supply difficulties, Indian
tractor output has lagged behind rated production capacity, reaching only
17,099 in 1969/70, against a licensed capacity of 30,000 units. It is thus
extremely difficult to forecast the expected future increase in Indian
production, but it would appear that by 1974/75 total tractor output from
existing and new plants might be of the order of 34,000 units per annum,
or double the output achieved in 1969/70. Thereafter, as initial establishment
difficulties are overcome, production might well increase at a faster rate.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
19.        In the last decade, most tractor imports have come from Eastern
bloc countries under trade agreements. Agreements negotiated during 1969/70
covered a further 25,000 tractors expected to arrive during the next three
years. Thereafter, such imports may be expected to decline, particularly
since the program of future Indian production envisages the manufacture of
Czechoslovakian, Hungarian, and Russian tractors at plants with a total
licensed capacity of 32,000.
20.       On average, Haryana has been receiving about 10% of total Indian
supplies over the past three years. On the basis of this slhare remaining
unchanged and the forecast supply position outlined above, Haryana would
receive about 17,000 tractors during the five years ending 1974/75.
Tractor Demand
21.       Under its Fourth Five-Year Plan, Haryana plans by 1973/74 to increase
the gross irrigated area to 2.5 million ha and the area sown more than once
to 2.0 million ha. Between 1970/71 and 1974/75, the area sown more than once
could increase by 0.8 million hectares (Appendix 2-3), and this extension
of the double cropped area will of itself require additional power on the
farm. Little increased availability of human and animal power can be ex-
pected, so mechanical power must be provided if the full benefits in increased
output are to be achieved from the increase in cropping intensity.
22.       The State Government and HAIC estimated the demand at current prices
to be about 10,000 additional tractors over the period. Assuming an increase
in the area sown more than once of 0.8 million ha and a minimum coverage of
40 ha for tractor under farm ownership, 20,000 tractors would be needed. As
calculated in paragraph 20 above, Haryana's share of Indian general tractor
availability during the five years ending 1974/75 is estimated to total
17,000. When deduction is made for replacements of the existing park, the
additional supply will amount to only 14,000. Importation of 6,000 tractor
units under the Project would thus be economically justified to enable the
planned expansion to take place.
23.       On this basis, the tractor park in Haryana would grow from 10,000
in 1969/70 (at 40 ha per tractor, representing coverage of 8% of the total
cropped area - 5 million ha) to 30,000 units in 1974/75 (representing coverage
of 22% of the increased cropped area of 5.5 million ha). The increase in
the number of tractors would lead to improved service and spare part
facilities and would thus increase the efficiency of the existing park.
Future Trends
24.        The trend towards greater cropping intensity and increased
p;roduction can be expected to continue, but at reduced rates.  As apprecia-
tion grows of tile tractor's potential and implements and equipment for
more specialized operations are made available, mechanized farming is likely



ANNEX '
Page 7
to become progressively more labor saving. But at this second stage of
development, the growth of marketing, transport, storage, and processing
services for the higher level of output, coupled with the expansion of
manufacturing repair and servicing industries for tractors and their more
sophisticated equipment should create new employment in rural areas to offset
any labour displacement on the land.
25.       There is, however, an urgent need to formulate and execute in-
depth research programs for the study of the problems that follow in the
wake of the present rapid spread of mechanization in the north-western
wheat belt, of which Haryana is a part. From such coordinated research,
it should be possible to draw firmer conclusions as to the social effects of
this development, as well as have more data as to the economics of future
farm mechanization. Proposals have been made for such special studies to be
undertaken with financial support from the Bank at both the Indian Institute
of Management, Ahmedabad, and Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana.
B. TRACTORS - TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Background
26.       Basic conditions in Haryana favor the mechanization of farming
operations. The soils over the bulk of the State are light and easily
worked. As a result of land consolidation, holdings consist of a varying
number of individual plots, rectangular in shape and about one acre in
size, separated only by irrigation bunds - a layout that is conducive to
mechanized farming.
27.       The demand for more power for farming operations is reinforced by
the farmer's rapidly growing transport needs arising from the increase in
his marketable surpluses. Storing on the farm in traditional type containers
only a portion of his own requirements, the farmer continues to market the
bulk of his output as and when it is harvested, because he has doubts as
to the storing qualities of, for example, new wheat, and because there are
no price incentives to compensate for on-farm storage costs and losses.
Moreover, the fact that virtually all settlements are of the concentrated
village type mean that there is naturally a considerable degree of movement
from field to village. To this is added the movement from village to market
- an average of 10 km - since most farmers prefer to sell al main markets
(mundis), rather than through village intermediaries or cooperatives. As
a result, at the present time, a considerable proportion of a tractor's
total working hours is spent on transportation.
28.       The characteristic light, easily worked soils and small fields
obtaining in Haryana make it possible for a case to be made out for the
use of tractors of 25 hp, especially since, more often than not, the
tractor is being used mainly for preparatory tillage work and transport,
limiting the present demands on its power. As more operations involving



ANNEX 2
Page 8
more sophisticated implements are undertaken by the tractor, it may be
expected that as elsewhere, the trend in demand will be towards higher
horsepower tractors. In India, at present, however, artificially low
prices of small horsepower tractors imported under bilateral trade deals
have distorted normal price/hp relationship.
29.       Future Indian production plans cover the manufacture of lower
horsepower ranges and include the manufacture in India of a 25 hp model
with collaboration from a U.K. firm (British Leyland).
30.       Since the ultimate selection of tractors under the procedure will
be governed by "farmers' choice", and since this choice will in turn be based
on competitive price quotations from which a rational price/hp relationship
can be expected to emerge, the hp range of tractors to be imported under the
Project has been set at 25-55 hp.
231.      In view of the present supply/demand position in India, tractors
required for the Project would need to be imported. The importation of
tractor components which are either not manufactured in India or are in
short or unreliable supply would not meet the position as prompt delivery of
the finished tractor could not under present conditions be assured. Moreover,
this method of procurement would place an additional assembly burden on
existing manufacturers who have plans to expand their production.
Tractor Outlet, Repair, and Spare Part Facilities
32.       Indian tractor manufacturers maintain in all over 40 tractor service
workshops in Haryana, 34 of which belong to dealers appointed by manufacturers
with technical collaborations in Bank member countries (Appendix 2-4) who
also maintain regional technical and marketing representatives.
33.       The private dealers are required by the firms they represent to
maintain designated standards of workshops, servicing, repair and spare
part facilities and are given assistance in staff training. They offer
free warranty inspections, past-warranty service schemnes at fixed annual
rates, together with on-farm training of tractor operators and farmers.
34.       Haryana Agro-Industries Corporation (HAIC) handles the distribu-
tion within the State of tractors imported under bilateral trade arrangements
with East European countries, notably Czechoslovakian Zetor 2011, Russian
DT-14B, Russian Bylarus, Bulgarian Bolgar TL 30A (crawler-type) and Rumanian
Universal 650 models. In addition, at its main workshop at Nilokheri, 13AIC
operates, with technical assistance from the Czechoslovakian company, a
well-organized assembly line for Zetor tractors for distribuJtion not otliy In
Haryana but also in other States.
35.       To provide essential service, repair and spare part facilities for
the tractors it distributes, HAIC in addition to its base workshop at
Nilokheri, operates two other service stations ancd plans to establish
shortly a service center in each district, with facilities, including
mobile service vans, of comparable standard to those provided by the private



ANNEX 2
Page 9
dealer network. Sub-centers would be provided by the appointment of agents,
as it is HAIC's policy to supplement and not to supplant the private contrac-
tor.
36.       Despite the private dealer and HAIC network of servicing units,
it is estimated that more than half of all tractor repairs and servicing
is carried out in a multitude of village and small town shops, often run
by former operators of tractor dealers. Operating with the sparest of
resources and often utilizing limited spare parts, these repair shops
provide the farmers with on-the-spot service at reasonable rates. It is
largely thanks to their ingenuity that the lives of many tractors have
been extended long beyond the normal.
37.       While existing repair and servicing facilities may, therefore,
be considered adequate, tractor suppliers under the Project should be
required to demonstrate that their particular facilities in Haryana are
sufficient to meet the increased demand. If such suppliers do not already
have such an organization, it would be open to them to provide it either
through the appointment of new dealers or by utilizing the existing
services of HAIC, or by a combination of both methods.
Tractor Implements
38.       At the moment, a farmer acquiring a tractor for the first time
buys on average less than two implements, reflecting the restricted use being
made of tractor power, and his lack of knowledge as to the utilization of
its full potential. The fact that under existing PLMB credit schemes the
farmer's contribution is represented by his cash purchase of implements
acts as a further disincentive. At the same time, as between tractor owners
there appears to be a considerable amount of implement sharing; borrowings
being paid for by services rendered rather than in cash.
39.       The most commonly used implements in Haryana are those required
for preparatory tillage work - mouldboard plows, disc plows, cultivators
and disc harrows - together with trailers and levellers. There is a
growing demand for seed-cum-fertilizer drills, seeding attachments to
cultivators, ridgers, inter-row cultivators and spraying equipment. There
are two main sources of supply of implements, namely:
(a) Tractor manufacturers who either make themselves or
through approved contractors implements designed
especially for use with their make of tractor; or
(b) small-scale manufacturers.
In both cases, the implements are mostly modified versions of models
developed in other countries. Mainly because of their higher specifications,
those models made by or under the control of tractor manufacturers are
dearer than implements made by small-scale manufacturers.



ANNEX 2
Page 10
40.       In Haryana, there are 78 implement manufacturers recognized by
the Department of Agriculture. Their output, together with that of an
even larger number of smaller scale manufacturers, is sold not only
within Haryana but also in neighboring States. In general, production is
considered capable of expansion to meet Project needs, but difficulties have
arisen from the shortage of hardened steel for plow bottoms and discs, which
have been met by special imports of these components by HAIC for distribution
to approved manufacturers.
41.       Although adequate in quantity, more attention needs to be paid to
research and development on the adaptation of overseas models to local
conditions, and to quality improvement. At present, implement manufacturers
are "approved" mainly for the purpose of distributing scarce materials. There
is need for the progressive widening of this basis towards quality marketing
of implements that have satisfied field tests and other trials. This
would involve the bringing together of many entities, such as the ilaryana
Agricultural University, HAIC, the Department of Agriculture, as well as
representatives of tractor and implement manufacturers. A start should be
made on these lines so that farmers can receive more and better guidance on
the selection and use of implements.
42.       Under the Project, loans would he made to cover 75% of the combined
cost of a tractor and at least three implements in order to ensure maximum
tractor utilization and economic benefits. The farmer should select the
implements he needs from those manufactured by approved firms and/or those
qualifying under a quality improvement scheme.
C. HAR1VESTING NACITITNERY
43.       As in the case of Punjab, conditions in Haryana favour the
introduction of mechanized harvesting, particularlv for wheat, but also
for rice. Labor shortages in the face of greatlv increased production have
resulted not onlv in rising costs but also in delays in completion of har-
vesting operations. When, as in 1970, the monsoon rains came earlier than
usual, grain was damaged and farmers sustained losses because harvesting
operations had not been completed. Even without such special losses, delays
in the completion of harvesting operations are seriously prejudicing farmers'
chances of achieving maximum results from douible cropoing. This applies to
land preparation for the sowing of both Kharif crops after wheat and Rabi
wheat after rice. TInder the Project 20 self-propelled combines and 100
harvesters would be provided.  These would harvest about 14,000 ha out of a
total cropped area of 5 million ha. They would not, therefore, cause any
major labour displacement.
44.       As of November 1970, HAIC had had only limited experience with
one combine operating during this year's rice harvest. In the Punjab, however,



ANNEX 2
Page 11
under basically similar conditions, the Punjab Agro-Industries Corporation
imported 8 East European 14 ft cut combines (costing Rs 126,000 (US$16,800)
- including import duty at 27-1/2%) and operated these on a custom service
basis during the 1970 wheat harvest (April/May 1970). In all, these 8
combines worked on 120 farms covering 1,800 ha, averaging 0.75 ha per hour.
Average costs were Rs 153 (US$20) per ha (including depreciation at 12-1/2%).
Farmers willingly paid the custom service rate of Rs 250 (US$33.3) per ha as
manual harvesting costs normally exceed Rs 300 (US$40) per ha; while 10% lower
grain losses would give additional savings, valued at current wheat yields
and prices at Rs 275 (US$36.7) per ha. On this basis, total gains per ha
could be of the order of Rs 425 (US$56.7).
45.       Although somewhat lower than the preliminary forecasts of Rs 500
(US$66.7) made on the basis of pilot project experience in the Punjab
Agricultural Credit Project report (PA-48a of May 27, 1970), these gains
in only one season are impressive enough to justify the inclusion in the
Project of provision for harvesting machinery. Because of the lack of
entrepreneurs with experience in this field and the relatively higher
investment involved, the number of applicants for such loans may be limited,
but HIAIC, which recognizes that it has a pioneering role to play in the
development of custom services, should be regarded as eligible to apply
for up to 50% of the machines proposed under the Project.

HARYANA AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
THE AGRICULTURAL REFINANCE CORPORATION
Organization and Management
1.        The Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) was established on
July 1, 1963, with the objectives of providing medium- and long-term fi-
nance to agricultural credit institutions and, at the same time, directing
and guiding such institutions toward a development oriented approach in
their operations.
2.        ARC's shareholders include the Reserve Bank of India (RBI),
central and state-level land development and mortgage banks and coopera-
tive banks and other institutions (scheduled banks, the Life Insurance
Corporation of India, insurance and investment companies, and others ap-
proved by the Government of India). Of the initial 5,000 shares issued,
the law provided that RBI shall subscribe to at least 50%, the central
land mortgage banks and state cooperative banks to no more than 30%, and
other institutions to no more than 20% and future issues of shares would
be allocated in the same proportion. The initial shares issued were
guaranteed a dividend of 4-1/4% per annum.
3.        ARC's management is vested in a Board of Directors of nine mem-
bers, three of whom are elected and the rest nominated. Three directors
represent RBI (a Deputy-Governor is Chairman of the Board), three the
Government of India (at present the Secretary, Department of Agriculture,
and the Additional Secretary, Department of Cooperation of the Ministry
of Food, Agriculture, Community Development and Cooperation; and a Joint
Secretary, Department of Banking of the Ministry of Finance), and three
directors are elected one each by the central land development banks, by
the state cooperative banks, and by the Life Insurance Corporation of
India, scheduled banks, and other insurance and financing institutions.
4.        The Managing Director is the chief executive officer and is
assisted by a managerial staff of nearly 90 (as of October 1970) of whom
65 are based at ARC's head office. Until early 1970, ARC did not employ
any specialists, instead relying on a panel of consultants for technical
advice in appraisal and supervision work. To supplement consultants'
advice, ARC has established a Technical Division which, as of October 1970
comprised three agricultural specialists and an agricultural economist and
to which ARC proposes to make further appointments. With the increasing
volume of lending, ARC recognizes the need to build up its staff at all
levels and is preparing a staff development plan to cover the period to
the end of 1973.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
5.        ARC's head office is in Bombay.  It has 13 regional offices
(Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Calcutta, Chandigarh,
Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kanpur, Madras, New Delhi, Patna, and Trivandrum) which
assist banks and State Governments in formulating agricultural development
projects for financing, clarify ARC's policies and procedures when required,
undertake pre-appraisal of projects submitted and supervise general execution
of projects under ARC financing. About 25 managerial staff are employed in
the Regional Offices.
6.        In general, ARC's charter provides that it shall be guided by
such directions in matters of policy involving public interest as GOI
may, after consulting RBI, give in writing. ARC can extend financial as-
sistance only to central or state-level land development banks, state co-
operative banks, and scheduled banks: in exceptional cases, and with RBI
approval, it can also lend directly to a primary cooperative at the farm
level. Refinance is provided through purchases of special debentures
floated by central or state-level land development banks and through loans
to state cooperative banks and scheduled banks.
7.        Until June 1966, it was not normally ARC's policy to refinance
construction and energization of wells by individuals unless the outlay
involved was large and development was envisaged through a cooperative
society organized for the purpose. In July 1966, however, ARC not only
removed this restriction, but also circulated a model scheme for minor
irrigation development by farmers in compact areas. Thus, began ARC's
policy of financing individual farmers on the basis of project models.
8.        At the beginning, ARC's policy was to finance no more than 75%
of a project, leaving the balance to be contributed by State Governments.
However, the generally strained resources position of most State Govern-
ments considerably restricted the extent to which land development banks
could avail themselves of refinance facilities from ARC. Accordingly,
to stimulate investments in minor irrigation especially, ARC increased
its support of such investments to 90%, beginning with all projects sanc-
tioned in 1967/68.
9.        Special debentures purchased by ARC from central land development
banks must be guaranteed by the State Government concerned; in addition,
debentures are backed by a charge on all mortgages resulting from loans
tefinanced under the issue.  In the case of debentures, ARC requires that
collections from farmers be lodged in a sinking fund. The sinking fund is
invested in GOI securities and debentures of other land development banks.
It may also be used to repurchase the land development bank's own debentures.
Since from the view point of financial returns, the sinking fund arrangements
do not benefit a land development bank as issuer of debentures, ARC has
decided that repayments of its refinances under IDA supported projects
should approximately match those of ultimate borrowers to lending banks.



ANNEX 3

10.       ARC will refinance agricultural development schemes which are
technically feasible, financially justified, and are within a reasonably
compact area for facility of loan evaluation and supervision. The scheme
can involve just one farmer, a group of farmers, or an association of
farmers. Preference, however, is given to schemes involving a large number
of farmers.
11.       Technical evaluation of schemes is carried out by consultants
drawn from a panel approved by the Government of India. Services of the
Central Ground Water Board (formerly the Exploratory Tubewells Organization),
the Geological Survey of India and the various commodity boards are also
used and ARC prescribes the terms of reference in every case. Some important
points examined in the case of schemes for minor irrigation include, an
estimate of the quantum of water proposed to be tapped, annual water re-
charge, annual water draft, taking into account the existing and proposed
wells, and the type of pump sets needed. With the establishment of its own
Technical Division, increasing back-up support is now available from ARC's
own specialist staff which will provide a foundation of technical expertise
for scheme appraisal and supervision throughout India.
12.       Economic evaluation of schemes is performed by ARC staff.  Some
of the important aspects appraised include cost estimates, the suitability
of the cropping pattern recommended, inputs available for development,
farmer's repayment capacity, efficiency of the project executing agency, ar-
rangements for the provision of short-term credits and marketing arrangements.
Preappraisal is done generally by regional offices, but final evaluation is
made in Bombay.
13.       Periods of refinance are determined after a study of the repayment
capacity of farmers based on farm models. Refinance terms for medium-term
projects are 3 to 5 years and for long-term projects are now generally 12
to 15 years.
14.       With effect from November 1970 ARC's general lending rate was
raised from 6 to 6-1/2% per annum. Scheduled banks are required to charge
their borrowers no more than an additional 2-1/2% per annum and while land
development (and mortgage) banks are not bound by the same restriction,
they nevertheless generally follow the same interest mark-up and none
exceeds it. ARC collects a commitment charge of 1/3 of 1% on the amount
not used in any one year according to a schedule of expected withdrawals
approved for a scheme.
Lending (Refinancing) Operations
15.       The following table shows the progress in ARC's lending (less
subsequent cancellations) during the seven years of its existence:

Total         371               2,595.10        2,148.90
16.       During the initial years, ARC transacted very little business
due to the need for laying the groundwork and bases for its operations
and for building its staff. An important deterrent, however, was ARC's
policy, at the time, of refinancing only projects in which development
was envisaged through a cooperative society organized for the purpose.
In June 1966, this restriction was removed; furthermore, ARC agreed to
refinance up to 90% of loans for minor irrigation, against 75% previously.
Thus, during the last three years, projects approved for refinancing were
more than six times the number during the first four years.
17.       As may be expected, most of the schemes sanctioned were for
projects financed by land development or mortage banks:

Source of Funds
19.       Apart from share capital, ARC can raise funds from the following
sources:  (a) borrowings from GOI and from any entity approved by GOI; (b)
issue and sale of debentures and bonds guaranteed by GOI; (c) borrowings
from RBI for periods not exceeding 18 months; and (d) deposits from GOI,
the State Government, and local authorities for periods not less than 12
months. Total borrowings and deposits received may not exceed 20 times
the sum of ARC's capital and surplus reserves.
20.       ARC's borrowings and receipts of deposits during the seven years
of its existence are summarized as follows:
Year         Borrowings           Deposits Received
Rs M                   Rs M
1963/64           50.000                    _
1964/65             -                    1.130
1965/66             -                    1.255
1966/67             -                    1.255
1967/68           30.000                 1.255
1968/69          177.500                 1.254
1969/70          299.377                 1.251
Total      556.877                  7.400
Of ARC borrowings during 1969/70, Rs 109,377,000 was raised by a public
issue of ARC 5-3/4% bonds 1982. The balance of borrowings (Rs 447.5 mil-
lion) have been from GOI as follows:

100.000              5-1/2            At end of 15 years
267.500              5                At end of 9 years
Since August 1968, ARC has been allowed a rebate of 1/4% on timely payments
of interest. The larger loan of Rs 267.5 million was for a shorter term,
since the proceeds were used to refinance, in the main, minor irrigation
schemes, generally requiring refinance for nine years or less. The special
deposits represent dividends payable on ARC's shares held by RBI which,
under the law, must be held by ARC as special deposits. No interest is
paid on them.
21.       A comparative statement of ARC's operating results since its
establishment until 1969/70 is given in Appendix 3-1 and is summarized
below (in Rs million):
Net
Income    Statutory  Surplus
Gross    Total      Net   Income   Before    Dividend       or

1964/65    4.00      0.39     3.61    1.76      1.85         2.13      -0.28
1965/66    4.35      0.48     3.87    2.27      1.60         2.13      -0.53
1966/67    4.98      0.61     4.36    2.40      1.97         2.13      -0.16
1967/68    6.00      1.67     4.33    2.38      1.95         2.13      -0.18
1968/69   11.04      6.29     4.75    2.61       2.14        2.13       0.01

22.       In the first three years of ARC's operations, income was derived
mostly from interest on investments. Beginning 1966/67, this pattern
changed when ARC began to expand rapidly its refinancing operations (para.
15). In 1969/70, interest received from loans and debentures represented
88% of total income received.
23.       Benefitting from cost-free funds available to it during the
first four years of its existence, ARC's main items of expense at the
time was salaries and employee benefits. Needing more funds for its ex-
panded operation, interest paid on borrowed money has since 1967/68 been
an important item of expenses. In 1969/70, interest paid on borrowings
and salaries and employee benefits were 83% and 10%, respectively, of
total expenses.
24.       Until 1968/69 net income after taxes had not been sufficient
to meet the statutory dividend liability of 4-1/4% payable annually to
ARC's initial shareholders (para. 2) and the annual deficiency had to
be made good by GOI in accordance with its guarantee under the law. ARC
will have to reimburse these amounts out of future profits. In 1968/69

HARYANA AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
HARYANA STATE COOPERATIVE LAND MORTGAGE BANK LTD.
AND PRIMARY LAND MORTGAGE BANKS
A. The Structure of the Haryana Land Mortgage Bank System
1.        The land mortgage banking structure in Haryana is federal in
character with the Primary Banks (PLMBs) functioning at the tehsil level
(sub-division of a district) federated into the State Land Mortgage Bank
(SLMB). Although each PLMB is theoretically independent, SLMB, in fact,
controls their operations since: (i) it is the only permitted source of
their borrowings and can withhold funds from any bank which does not meet
its requirements; and (ii) provides all PLMB staff on secondment (including
managers) which PLMBs are bound to accept.
2.        For all practical purposes, therefore, SLMB and its federated
PLMBs can be considered as a single entity with an operational relationship
similar to that of a bank head office to its branches. The PLMBs (under
SLMB direction and guidance) are responsible for making loans to their mem-
bers, such lending being wholly re-financed by SLMB. As of June 30, 1970,
the 23 PLMBs had a total membership of about 44,000.
3.        In the following paragraphs the operations of SLMB and PLMBs are
considered separately in regard to their organization, management, and re-
sources. Their lending procedures being closely integrated are considered
together in further sections.
B. The Haryana State Cooperative Land Mortgage Bank Ltd.
Organization and Management
4.        SLMB was registered on October 17, 1966, on the creation of the
State of Haryana out of a reorganized State of Punjab. It is an apex
institution for a network of 23 PLMBs with its office in Chandigarh, the
State capital. It operates under the Cooperative Land Mortgage Banks Act
1957, and the Cooperative Society Act 1961.
5.        Under the General Body, with powers equivalent to an Annual
General Mleeting of shareholders in a joint stock company, SLIM's affairs
are directed by a 15 member Board consisting of ten members elected by PLMBs,



ANNEX 4
Page 2
three nominated by the State Government, and one each nominated by the State
Cooperative Bank and the Registrar of Cooperatives. To facilitate admin-
istration most of the Board's powers devolve to a nine man Executive Com-
mittee. Both the Board and the Executive Committee have a three-year term.
6.        The Secretary is SLMB's chief executive officer.  He is appointed
by the Board subject to the approval of the Registrar of Cooperatives. He
is assisted by an Additional Secretary, as his deputy, and two Assistant
Secretaries responsible for administration, accounts, and the inspection
and supervision of PLIlBs. As at June 30, 1970, the staff numbered 254 out
of which 43 were in the head office in Chandigarh and the remainder were
on secondment to PLMBs.
7.        Whilst the staff includes many graduates in the arts and law it
has no specialists in agriculture and economics and basically it is deficient
in credit experience. SLMB recognizes that in future it must re-orientate
its lending policies to the developmental aspects of investments rather
than the collateral aspects, and is taking steps, with the assistance of
ARC, to train its staff accordingly. It will, however, need to recruit
some specialists and will establish a small technical cell at head office
,consisting of an agricultural economist, a chief inspecting officer (an
experienced graduate in agriculture), and two inspecting officers (also
graduates). In addition, a technical officer (a graduate in agriculture or
agricultural economics) will be stationed in each PLMB to advise and assist
the Land Valuation Officers (LVOs) with loan appraisals. More qualified
and experienced managers for PLMBs (17) will also be recruited. SLMB also
receives technical support from the Project Officer (a Joint Director of
Agriculture), appointed by the State Government, and his staff which
:Lncludes two Assistant Project Officers (secretary level), a Chief Well
Supervisor, and soil conservation specialists.
Source of Funds
8.        As an apex organization, SLMB's share capital is contributed by
the PLMBs (at a rate of 5% of borrowings from SLMB) and the Haryana State
(,overnment. As of June 30, 1970, SLMB's total subscribed capital was
Els 11.7 million (US$1.6 million), as against Rs 100 million (US$13 million)
authorized, of which the State Government's contribution was Rs 3.5 million
or about 30%.  The following table shows the growth of SLNB's issued share
capital divided as to the PLMBs' and State Government subscriptions as of
the dates shown.

As at June 30, 1970, reserves and undistributed profits totalled Rs 1.5 mil-
lion representing 1% of total loan portfolio.
9.        Apart from short-term bridging finance provided by commercial
banks, SLMB's borrowings have derived from the issue of debentures. These
are guaranteed by the State Government as to payment of interest and repay-
ment of principal and are secured by the mortgages financed from the pro-
ceeds of a particular debenture issue. As in the case of other State Land
Banks in India, SLMB floats three types of debentures:
(a) ordinary debentures about 80% of which are purchased by
the Life Insurance Corporation of India, the State Bank
of India, and RBI under pre-arranged quotas, the balance
being sold on the open market but largely being taken
up by sister institutions. Brokerage and underwriting
commission are fixed by RBI, the issue price being
dependent on the money market. In 1968/69 interest rates
were 6% per annum on debentures issued at 99-1/4% which
was marginally higher than in previous years. As at June 30,
1970, the amount of this type of debenture outstanding was
Rs 90 million (US$12 million);
(b) rural debentures which are sold only to individuals since
their purpose is to encourage the mobilization of local
savings. To stimulate their sale, RBI subscribes in the
ratio of eight for every seven rural debetures sold and
receives interest at 1% less than the regular rate. Pre-
sent rates are 6% on five-year and 5% on ten-year debentures
issued at par. No sales were made during 1969/70 because of
the unattractive interest rates, which are below those
offered by commercial banks for deposits of similar term and
non-institutional borrowers. This matter is being examined
by RBI, ARC, and the land mortgage banks. The amount of
rural debentures outstanding as at June 30, 1970, was Rs 2
million (US$300,000); and
(c) special debentures which are issued for financing
agricultural projects approved by ARC. They are
subscribed by ARC and the State Government in



ANNEX 4
Page 4
proportions decided by ARC and are currently in
the ratio of 9:1 for minor irrigation projects and
3:1 for other projects. Interest paid on these
debentures is also decided by ARC and the present
rate is 6-1/2% per annum. Special debentures out-
standing at June 30, 1970, amounted to Rs 65 million
(US$8.6 million).
SLMB's borrowings may not exceed 25 times paid-up capital and reserves.
C. Primary Land Mortgage Banks (PLMBs)
Organization and Membership
10.       As of June 30, 1970, there were 23 PLMBs operating in Haryana.
It is proposed to establish two more PLMBs during the next three years.
All are presently profit-making and the overall default position is less
than 1%.
11.       The membership of PLMBs falls into two classes.  First, the
regular (or A class) membership open to individuals and cooperative farming
and tubewell irrigation societies. Such members must be landowners and
thus be able to offer the security of land. Accordingly, only A class
members are entitled to borrow. Second, there is B class membership made
up of individuals who are cosharers in the property of A class members.
This class of membership exists to faciliate the execution of mortgages
on farms of regular members who otherwise would have insufficient collateral
to borrow. Only A class members have voting rights and are entitled to any
(lividends which the PLMBs may declare. On June 30, 1970, the PLMBs had a
total regular membership of about 40,000 (compared with 34,000 a year
earlier) and the number of outstanding loans by all PLMBs totalled about
28,000.
Management
12.       Management of each PLMB follows the SLMB pattern with overall
control vested in the General Meeting and with a committee exercising the
functions of a Board of Directors. The manager of each PLMB (who is a
secondment from SLMB) is the chief executive. The main functions of PLMBs
are the sanction, disbursement, and recovery of loans.
Source of Funds
13.       The main sources of funds of PLMBs are members' silare capital,
loans from the SLMB, and undistributed profits. Each PLB hlas its own
share capital and borrowers are required to hold shiares to the value of 5;
of a loan.  Equally PLMBs must invest in SLMB shares to the extent of 5'
of their borrowings. As at June 30, 1970, the total share capital of all



ANNEX, /
Page D
23 PLMBs amounted to Rs 11 million (US$1.5 million) whilst total outstanding
borrowings from SLMB amounted to Rs 156.6 million (US$21 million). PLMB
borrowings may not exceed 25 times the paid-up share capital.
D. Overall Lending Policies and Procedures
Purposes of Loans
14.       PLMBs lend for (and thus SLMB refinances) a wide range of agricul-
tural purposes on long-term including:
(a) the construction, improvement, and repair of minor
irrigation works;
(b) land drainage, levelling, reclamation, and improve-
ment;
(c) purchase of farm machinerv including tractors and
implements;
(d) purchase of land occupancy rights and redemption
of mortgages; and
(e) such other purposes as the Board may determine to be
for land improvement or agricultural production.
Lending Procedures
15.       Applications for a loan have to be made to the PLMB of which the
applicant is a member. All applicants, who must be cultivators of the land
to be mortgaged, are required to deposit a fee at the rate of Rs 0.5 per
Rs 100 of the proposed loan limit with a minimum of Rs 25. The final fee
is determined in accordance with the amount of the loan finally sanctioned.
16.       tJntil recently lending procedures have largely been based on the
value of the security offered rather than to the economic benefits deriving
from loans. This is historical inasmuch as the banks were founded, as their
titles still imply, to take over mortgages which bore exorbitant interest
rates thereby reducing the influence of money lenders. The change in the
role of the land mortgage banks towards development banking will require a
change in lending procedures and the SULM is well aware of this. Steps are
being taken, with the help of ARC, to train staff in the techniques of
development banking. Additional specialist staff is being recruited (para
7). In future loan applications will be individually appraised on the basis
of the incremental benefits of the proposed investments. New procedures
are being introduced and these are given in detail at Appendix 4-5.



ANNEX 4
Page 6
Lending Terms and Interest Rates
17.       Borrowers are required to hold shares equivalent to 5% of loans.
Farmers have been required to make a downpayment of 25% (which includes
the 5% shareholding) in respect of tractors and implements. In practice,
however, a loan has been made for the purchase of a tractor and the farmer
has been expected to buy implements, the purchase price of which has been
regarded as his downpayment. This is not satisfactory as farmers have
been inclined to purchase fewer implements than they needed to make effec-
tive use of the tractor. Under the Project borrowers for tractors will be
required to purchase at least three approved implements (the cost of which
will be included in the loan) and make a downpayment of 25% (including
shareholding) of the cost of tractor plus implements. The 25% downpayment
will also apply to combines and harvesters. In the case of tubewells no
downpayment other than the 5% shareholding has been required. Under the
Project it is proposed that a contribution of 20% (including shareholding)
should be made in respect of all minor irrigation investment. This would
also include the value of any benefits in kind contributed by the farmer,
including cost of labor.
18.       Tractor and tubewell loans are repayable over a maximum of seven
years including a one year grace period for tubewells. This is considered
satisfactory for the Project and sprinkler irrigation loans would also be
repayable on the same terms as for tubewells. Loans for combines have not
previously been made. They would be repayable over a maximum period of
five years with no grace period.
19.       PLMBs presently lend to farmers at 8-1/4% per annum and are
refinanced by SLMB at 6-3/4% per annum, giving them a margin of 1-1/2%.
This margin is considered adequate.  Up until December 1970 ARC refinanced
SLMB at 6% per annum, giving SLMB a margin of 3/4%. Taking SLMB's blend
of funds, its overall margin was slightly less than 3/4%. ARC has now
raised its interest rate to 6-1/2% per annum which will necessiate a rise
in bank lending rates. It is considered that in view of the need to
strengthen SLMB's technical staff a continuing spread of 3/4% would be
insufficient to enable it to meet the additional costs involved and make
profits and build up reserves. It is, therefore, proposed that PLMB's
rate to farmers be raised to 9% per annum (which would bring it into line
with rates charged for similar lending under IDA projects in Cujarat,
Punjab, and Andhra Pradesh) and that SLMB's rate to Pl.MBs be raised to
7-1/2% per annum which would still give PLMBs a margin of 1-1/2%. SLMB's
margin would be raised to 1% which would enable it to meet its additional
expenses.
E. Overall Operational Results
20.       SLMB's lending operations have grown rapidly since its establish-
ment in 1966.  Total amount of loans outstanding as at June 30 each year
were:  1967 - Rs 16 million (US82 million); 1968 - Rs 37 million (US$5



ANNEX 4
Page 7
million); 1969 - Rs 96 million (US$13 million); and 1970 - Rs 157 million
(USS20 million). The number of loans approved has similarly increased from
1,000 in 1967 to 11,000 in 1970. Minor irrigation loans are the largest
element in the loan portfolio currently representing about 69%, followed
by mechanization loans, 25%.  The remainder (6%) are for miscellaneous
purposes such as land reclamation, farm improvements, grape cultivation,
etc.
21.       Despite the narrow margin between borrowing and lending rates
(see para 19) SLMB has made small but increasing profits (Rs 275,000 in
1968/69 and Ps 738,000 in 1969/70). In view of its short existence (only
five years) it has not declared any dividends preferring to retain un-
distributed profits during its development period, although profits would
have enabled a modest dividend (about 5%) to be paid in 1969/7n. At least
25% of profits must, by law, be transferred to a statutory reserve. The
increased margin proposed in para 19 would enable SLMB to meet the addi-
tional expenses incurred in strengthening its technical staff and increase
its profits and reserves. There are no loans in arrears.
22.       The profits of PLNBs vary according to their size but all 23 are
profit making.  In 1968/69 total PLB profits exceeded those of SLMB
(Rs 350,000 against Rs 275,000). The increased expenses resulting from
more thorough appraisal of loan applications and the employment of addi-
tional technical staff should not cause a significant decrease in profits
taking into account the increase in PLMBs' volume of lending. Repayment
records are good, the overall percentage of default does not exceed 17.
23.       The accounts of SLMB and the PLMBs are audited by independent
auditors from the Cooperative Department, which is the common practice
throughout India. The SLNB has recognized the need to revise its accounting
procedures in view of the increased volume of lending and the change in
its type of business and a committee to examine the problems has been
established. ARC is also discussing improvements in the presentation of
Land Mortgage Bank accounts on an all-India basis.

HARYANA AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
MECHANIZATION PROCUREMENT
1.        The Project now proposed would be the fourth of a series of
agricultural credit projects in India which IDA is at present considering.
As in the case of Gujarat, Punjab, and Andhra Pradesh Credit Projects which
it follows, this and subsequent projects in the series would involve sub-
stantial tractor imports. Accordingly, in considering the earlier Projects,
careful attention was given to the method of tractor procurement and the
formula outlined below for Haryana substantially follows the previously
agreed arrangements.
2.        Farmers' purchase through existing dealerships would not be
feasible as the necessary competition between dealerships would only be
obtained by liberalizing import licensing to enable large scale tractor
imports. In view of India's shortage of foreign exchange this would be
inappropriate. Normal international competitive bidding could only be
organized through State entities. This would tend towards a Government
tractor distribution monopoly and further weaken existing dealership
channels and it would not take farmers' choice into account.
3.        To meet this situation, a formula has been worked out with the
Government of India (GOI), details of which would be as follows:
(a) GOI would establish a central committee (hereinafter
referred to as the Committee) for the purpose of directing
the procurement of goods under this Project. The Committee
would consist of representatives of GOI (one of whom would
be chairman), the Government of Haryana and the Agricultural
Refinance Corporation (ARC). Under the Committee's directions,
the Haryana Agro-Industries Corporation (HAIC) would organize the
procurement of goods under the Project in accordance with
the following procedures:
(b) HAIC would obtain tractor quotations on unit prices at
varying quantities from suppliers in IDA member countries
currently authorized to manufacture tractors in India.
These are Eicher (Federal Republic of Germany), Interna-
tional Harvester (USA) and Massey Ferguson (UK) with
plants in production and Deutz (Federal Republic of
Germany), Ford (UK) with plants for manufacture approved
by GOI. Further companies may be expected to be added
to the list; GOI is currently considering seven additonal



ANNEX 6
Page 2
proposals from firms in IDA member countries. Quotations
would be sought by public invitation and the form and
substance of the bid requests would be subject to IDA
concurrence.
(c)  HAIC would require all suppliers submitting quotations
to give full particulars as to proposed pre-sales and
after sales service arrangements, including provision
for spare parts equal to 15% of the CIF price of tractors
supplied. Any supplier not providing satisfactory assur-
ance as to service arrangements would, subject to IDA
concurrence, be disqualified by the Committee.
(d)  HAIC would advertise through the Haryana State Cooperative
Land Mortgage Bank (SLMB) and the participating commercial
banks, the quoted prices and service arrangements offered
by the different suppliers. Farmers would be required
to state to the Primary Bank of SLMB or the participating
commercial bank their first and second choice of tractor
which they would be willing to buy and at the same time make
application for a loan.
(e)  Farmers' tractor preferences would be sent to HAIC which
would aggregate the orders received according to first
tractor choices. If the aggregate orders for the parti-
cular model came to below the minimum acceptable order for
that manufacturer at the unit price quoted for varying
quantities, the Committee would discard the first choice
for those farmers and proceed on the basis of the second
or other choices as agreed by IDA. After approval by the
Committee, HAIC would send to IDA its analysis of bids and
its recommendations for the placing of orders. IDA would
then promptly inform the Committee whether it had any
objections to the recommended orders with its reasons.
(f)  HAIC would subsequently place orders with the selected
suppliers at the unit prices quoted. IIAIC would also
enter into contracts with the selected suppliers which
would specify service arrangements and performance
assurances including the supply of spare parts. Agents
representing suppliers would be required to sell post-
warranty service.
(g)  HAIC would arrange through the suppliers' representatives
in INDIA for the importation, insurance and transportation
to Haryana of tractors. Subsequently, the tractors would
be distributed to agents designated by the suppliers who
would perform pre-sales services and sell the tractors to
farmers whose loan applications had been approved.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
(h)  Suppliers would be required to maintain stocks of spare
parts by a designated representative in a central store
to be released through agents for tractors imported under
the Project.
(i) In the event of the Committee placing orders over the
reasonable objections of IDA on the grotnds of inconsistency
with the procedures or, if the terms of such orders
materially differed from those on which quotations were
based, IDA would reserve the right to cancel from the
Credit, such amount as it considered represented expen-
ditures under such orders.
4.        Tt is expected that the above tractor procurement method and
procedures would take account of individual preferences and tend to lower
prices while strengthening the services provided by manufacturers approved
agents which is considered essential to the Project.
HARVESTING MACHINEPRY
5.        Hiarvesting machinery would be procured by international competitive
bidding under arrangements to be made by the Committee. Bids would only be
sought against approved loan applications which would then be bulked to a
value of at least US$100,000 equivalent for purchase by dealers.






ANNEX 7

INDIA
HARYANA AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
HARYANA AGRO-INDUSTRIES CORPORATION
Organization and Management
1.        In accordance with the general policy of the Government of
India (GOI) to encourage the development of farm mechanization and agro-
industries through the establishment of public sector corporations in each
State, the Haryana Agro-Industries Corporation (HAIC) was incorporated as
a limited liability company on the March 31, 1967. It has an authorized
capital of Rs 20 million (US$2.7 million), of which Rs 11.9 million
(US$1.6 million) has been paid up, with equal subscriptions from GOI and
the Haryana Government.
2.        The Board of Directors of HAIC numbers ten, made up of three
representatives of GOI, four of the State Government, the Vice-Chancellor
of Haryana Agricultural University, one member of the State legislature as
representative of the farmers (who is also Chairman of the Board) and
the Managing Director, who is the Corporation's chief executive officer,
and a member of the Indian Administrative Service seconded by the State
Government. The Corporation has suffered from unduly frequent changes in
its top management - in the first three and a half years of its existence,
there were six changes in the appointment of Chairman and five in that of
Managing Director. Despite this handicap, the Corporation has made a
generally sound start.
3.        Like similar corporations in other States, HAIC is intended to
operate as a commercial organization. Under its Memorandum and Articles
of Association, the corporation has wide powers, including:
(a) the financing, manufacturing, and promotion of
agricultural machinery and equipment;
(b) the organization and management of engineering and
repair workshops;
(c) the purchase and sale of agricultural machines and
appliances including hire-purchase sales and the
provision of farm custom and other services; and
(d) the promotion or conduct of any agricultural, commer-
cial, or industrial enterprise.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
4.        The Corporation's head office is at Chandigarh, its main workshop
and tractor assembly plant at Nilokheri, with two main sales and service
stations at Panipat and Hissar. As of March, 1970, staff of the Corporation
totalled 270, of whom about 40 were employed at the head office.
Operations
5.        The main activities of HAIC have been concerned with tractors
imported under bilateral trade agreements with East European countries.
It has a small, well-organized assembly plant for Zetor 2011 tractors at
Nilokheri, where, over the past two years, 1,853 tractors received in semi-
knocked down condition have been assembled, with technical assistance from
the parent Czechoslovakian organization. Only 327 of these were distributed
in Haryana, the balance being made available to Punjab, Mladhya Pradesh,
Rajasthan, Bihar and Jammu and Kashmir. During the same period, some
1,400 tractors of various East European makes were distributed by the
Corporation in Haryana.
6.        Demand for tractors far exceeds supplies and HAIC invites
applications from farmers owning not less than 12 ha for tractors of 50
hp and above, and not less than 6 ha for others. Successful applicants
are then chosen by ballot.
7.        The Corporation's future plans cover the establishment of one
main service center in each district. In addition to providing repair,
spare part, and service facilities for tractors distributed by the Corpora-
tion, these centers would have tractors, land levelling equipment and
harvesting machinery, to be operated on a custom-service basis for farmers.
It is the declared policy of the Corporation to supplement private enter-
prise in the service and custom hiring fields, and to provide technical
facilities and assistance to emerging private contractors.
Other Activities
8.        HAIC has been the agency for the procurement and distribution
to approved implement manufacturers of components in short supply, notably
hard-steel discs for plows and harrows. It also distributes the iron and
steel quota (totalling 4,543 in tonnes in 1968/69) to implement manufacturers
in Haryana.
9.        HAIC owns and operates five feed processing mills, but its
activities in this field represented less than 5% of its turnover in
1969/70.
Resources and Financial Operations
10.       As of 30 June, 1969, HAIC's paid up capital and reserves
totalled Rs 11.2 million (US$1.5 million). Its profit record since its
establishment has been as follows:

HARYANA ACRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
1.        The rates of return from the Project to the economy have been
calculated as shown in the attached tables. The following assumptions
have been made:
(a) world market prices as projected by the Trade Policies
and Export Projections Division of IBRD's Economics
Department have been used to estimate benefits;
(b) current price levels have been used for investments
and allowance for cost increases has been excluded;
(c) labour has been costed at current off-season market
rates of Rs 5 per day; and
(d) a salvage value of 20% has been assumed at year 7 for
tractors and implements.
2.        Based on these assumptions, the economic rates of return over
a project life of 15 years would be 22 to 27% for minor irrigation and
15% for mechanization.
3.        On the basis of the above assumptions a sensitivity test
using a rate of exchange which reflects more closely the effective costs
of imports (which normally bear a duty of 27.5%) gives economic rates of
return of 29 to 35% for minor irrigation and 17% for mechanization. In
the case of mechanization the heavy initial foreign exchange input is
nevertheless offset by increased foreign exchange savings, particularly
for wheat production, if such a rate of exchange is used.
