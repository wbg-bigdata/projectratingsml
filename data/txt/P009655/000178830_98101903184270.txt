INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMiIENDATION OF HE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON PROPOSED CREDITS
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
FOR THE TAMIL NADU AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
AND THE HARYANA AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on two
proposed Credits in amounts in various currencies equivalent to US$35.0
million for the Tamil Nadu Project and to US$25.0 million for the
Haryana Project. These projects have the same broad common objective -
the provision of medium to long-term credit to farmers in India for
investment mainly in minor irrigation and mechanization as a means of
increasing agricultural production and furthering the adoption of new
production techniques. They are accordingly discussed in this single
report in order to avoid unnecessary repetition, and to provide a
comparative statement of agricultural credit programs of two States in
India separated by over a thousand miles and differing considerably in
climatic and physical conditions.
PART I - HISTCOiICAL
2.       Since 1949 the Bank has made 39 loans amounting to US$1,051
million and the Association 32 credits amounting to US$1,447 million
(both net of cancellations) to India. Of these,fifteen loans and credits
totalling some US$237 million were for agricultural projects in India.
Three recent IDA operations were to finance agricultural credit projects
in the States of Gujarat, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh, and Credits now
proposed would be two more in this series.
3.       The proposed Credits would assist in financing on-farm
investments in minor irrigation, farm mechanization and of certain
equipment required for project implementation (both projects) and,
additionally, in Tamil Nadu of land levelling and drainage and of some
consultancy services. They result from project preparation efforts which
began with a reconnaissance mission in which the IBRD/FAO Cooperative
Program participated in November and December 1968 directed towards
increasing the range and amount of institutional credit available to
farmers. Appraisal reports are now being prepared for two similar
projects in the States of Maharashtra and Mysore, and additional
projects are contemplated for appraisal next year in other States.
4.       The Tamil Nadu and Haryana Projects were both appraised in
September/October 1970. Negotiations were conducted in Washington
during the two weeks ending May 7, 1971. The Borrower was represented



- 2 -
by Mr. M. A. Quraishi (Additional Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture and
Food) and Mr. S. Guhan (Director, Department of Economic Affairs,
Ministry of Finance). The Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC)
was represented by its Chairman, Mr. P. N. Damry. Mr. S. Venkitaramanan
(Finance Secretary) and Mr. Reddy (Joint Director, Agricultural
Engineering Services) represented the State of Tamil Nadu. Mr. M.
Shanmughan (Member, Legislative Assembly) represented the Tamil Nadu
State Land Development Bank (LDB), of which he is Chairman. The State
of Haryana was represented by Mr. Sher Jang Singh (Secretary, Agriculture
Department).  The Haryana State Cooperative Land Mortgage Bank (LMB)
was represented by Mr. G. L. Bailur (Registrar, Cooperative Societies)
and the Haryana Agro-Industries Corporation (HAIC) was represented by
its Managing Director, Mr. A. K. Sinha.
5.       Of the 39 loans and 32 credits to India, seven loans and eleven
credits are not yet fully disbursed. A summary statement of these loans
and credits as at April 30, 1971, is contained in Attachment III.
6.       There have been delays in disbursing against some of these
projects. Disbursement under Loan No. 307-IN (Collieries Project) to
the Indian Iron and Steel Company have been delayed due to technical
and management difficulties faced by the Company in executing the
project, including the change from the originally contemplated open
pit method of coal excavation to shaft drilling, delays in land
acquisition, and more recently mining problems resulting from the
unusual geological nature of the area; revised mining plans and a new
schedule for the execution of the project should now permit its
completion by June 30, 1974, the revised Closing Date. A more detailed
description of the difficulties encountered in this project is set out
in my memorandum of July 9, 1970, to the Executive Directors (R 70-135);
since then, in December 1970, a review mission (including a consultant)
found that management of the project had improved. However, the
consultant's report indicates that the rate of shaft drilling is somewhat
behind the revised schedule; a letter has been sent to the Company
outlining the consultant's findings and urging that greater effort
be made to adhere to the agreed schedule.
7.       The Closing Date for Loan No. 414-IN has been postponed by one
year (to June 30, 1972) and that of Loan No. 515-IN may require post-
ponement. Both these loans are to ICICI. The postponements are due to
the slow rate of withdrawals by sub-borrowers who slowed up investment
during the 1966-68 recession. However, commitments have been made for
the full amounts of both loans and under the most recent loan to ICICI
(Loan No. 683-IN), and a mission to appraise a ninth loan to the
Company is scheduled for July. Delays in delivery of some major pieces
of equipment have adversely affected the pace of construction work on
the Beas Project (Credit No. 89-DI). A mission reviewed this project in
December 1970, and agreed upon a revised disbursement schedule, calling
for completion in 1974 which could involve a two-year extension of the
original Closing Date. Disbursement under the Sixth Industrial Imports



- 3 -
Credit (Credit No. 182-IN) has been unexpecbedly slow.   At the time
the Credit was signed in April 1970, it wqas expected that full disburse-
ment would have taken place by March 31, 1971 but GOI has issued
import licenses sparingly and only to those priority industries which
were unable to use bilateral aid. Furthermore, although production has
recovered somewhat from the 1966-68 recession, neither production nor
import requirements have grown as fast as GOI expected a year ago.
Import licenses against the full amount of the Credit have been issued
several months back, and full disbursement is now expected before the
end of 1971. Tenders for major items of expenditure under Tarai
Seeds (Loan No. 614-IN) and Punjab Agricultural Credit (Credit No. 203-IN)
have recently been approved. A mission has recently returned from
India after reviewing progress on the Tenth Railways Project (Credit No.
162-IN) and forecasts full disbursement of the Credit by the Closing
Date of September 30, 1971, or very shortly thereafter.
8.       In the case of the Third Telecommunications Project (Loan
No. 615-IN and Credit No. 153-IN), which was approved in June 1969,
only about US$14 million have been disbursed so far, but procurement
action has been taken for the full amount; it is expected that dis-
bursements will have reached US$50 million by March 1972 and will be
completed before the Closing Date (December 31, 1972).
9.       Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling
US$42.3 million of which US$2.8 miUion has been repaid, US$5.8 million
sold and US$6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$27.4 million,
US$19.1 million represents loans and US$8.3 million equity. As of
April 30, 1971, US$24.1 million of this total has been disbursed,
leaving US$12.0 million undisbursed. The largest commitment was a
total of US$18.9 million to Zuari Agro-Chemicals for a fertilizer plant
in Goa.
10.      Negotiations have recently been completed for proposed Credits
for the Cochin II Fertilizer Project and for the Pochampad Irrigation
Project. Other projects in an advanced stage of consideration are
Railway XI, Ships and Bombay Water Supply.
11.      Credit Summaries of both Projects and a Basic Data Sheet are
attached together with the Summary Statement of Loans and Credits.
PART II - THE PROJECTS
12.      The appraisal reports entitled "Tamil Nadu Agricultural Credit
Project - India" (PA-81a) and "Haryana Agricultural Credit Project -
India" (PA--80a) are attached.



13.      Both Projects follow broadly the pattern of the earlier
approved agricultural credit projects for Gujarat, Punjab and Andhra
Pradesh, although variations are incorporated to meet differences in
local circumstances. The Projects are designed to support the
Government of India's policy of increasing the developmental efforts
directed towards agriculture,of accelerating the rate at which
farmers adopt technological improvements, and of widening the
involvement of farmers in the benefits to be derived from this process.
In spite of the success which has already been achieved in obtaining
considerable increases in food production, it is desirable to enable
more farmers to adopt the new agricultural strategy by providing
medium to long-term credit which they need to finance the necessary
on-farm investments.
Tamil Nadu
14.      The Project in Tamil Nadu would finance part of a lending
program by banks in the State to help finance investment in minor
irrigation, land levelling, land drainage and improvement and farm
mechanization. It would increase minor irrigation facilities in the
State by the development of some 7,000 filter points and 4,500 tubewgells
as well as the installation of some 4,000 pumpsets to energize
existing filter points. It would also include an element for invest-
ment in dugwells and dugwell improvements (including energization).
Investments in levelling about 10,000 ha would be financed together
with some drainage, and the Project would include the financing of 12
rotary rigs and other equipment for well-drilling plus some land
shaping machinery. In addition, financing would be provided for about
1,500 general purpose tractors in the 25 to 60 hp range. Provision
is also made for consultancy services to the State Groundwater
Directorate and for an aerial survey of the crystalline areas of Tamil
Nadu and neighbouring States.
15.      The total project cost is estimated to be US$62 million, of
which the proposed Credit would finance about 56 percent (including an
estimated foreign exchange cost of US$12.9 million, and approximately
US$22.1 million equivalent of local expenditures).
16.      Benefits from the Project, which would reach approximately
50,000 Tamil Nadu farmers, would arise from an increase of about
60,000 ha in the crop areas (a further 150,000 ha would benefit
from improved farming conditions), a higher cropping intensity and
higher yields from the application of irrigation, mechanization and
timely cultivation practices. Food crop production, mainly rice and
maize, should increase by about 280,000 tons, and there would be
production gains in certain commercial crops. Taking account of both
import substitution and some export earnings increased crop production
estimated at US$29 million equivalent annually would bring considerable
benefit to India's foreign exchange position. The economic rate of
return is estimated to be at least 17 percent, and the financial rate



of return to the farmers should range from roughly 34 percent or more
(for land levelling) to 15 percent (for farm mechanizat_on).
Haryana
17.      The Haryana Project would help finance the construction of
about 11,000 shallow tubewells, the installation of 75 sprinkler
irrigation sets, and the import of about 6,000 tractors together
with spare parts. About 20 self-propelled harvesting combines and
about 100 tractor-drawn harvesters would also be procured.
18.      UJnder the Project, about 69,000 ha would be irrigated, which
would enable farmers to increase their cropping intensity and obtain
more reliable yields from areas which presently depend on uncertain
rainfall. Tractors supplied under the Project would increase cropping
intensity on about 120,000 ha.
19.      The total project cost is estimated to be US$44.5 million of
which the proposed Credit would finance about 56 percent,(including an
estimated foreign exchange cost of US$21.2 million, and approximately
US$3.8 million of local expenditures). Under the Project the
counterpart funds resulting from the sale of spare parts for tractors,
self-propelled combines and tractor-drawm harvesters, (i.e. US$ 2.7
million equivalent) would be relent for investment in minor
irrigation.
20.      The Project would benefit at least 20,000 Haryana farmers
investing in minor irrigation and farm mechanization,including many
small farmers who would be able to take advantage of tractor rental
services and tubewell facilities. Benefits to the Indian economy
would be a higher cropping intensity, facilitating a shift in cropping
patterns toward more valuable and labor intensive crops and higher
yields through reliable irrigation facilities and timely cultivation
practices. The overall rate of return to the economy would be at
least 15 percent. In calculating this rate of return, secondary
benefits such as the domestic value added by processing project
products have not been taken into account. Rates of return for farmers
would range from 17 percent to 35 percent.
Administrative Arrangements
21.      As was the case in earlier similar projects, funds for both
Projects will be channelled by the Borrower through the Agricultural
Refinance Corporation of India (ARC), for refinancing the lending
activities within the project areas of the LDB, the LMB and their
Primary Banks, and of those commercial banks which may participate.



- 6 -
22.      It will be noted that the combined Projects involve
substantial financing of local costs. This is necessary if the Bank
Group is to make an effective contribution to agricultural develop-
ment in India which, characteristically, involves a comparatively
small foreign exchange component. The more general case for local
expenditure financing has been discussed in recent economic reports,
including Chapter X of the latest report (SA-25a) which is just being
distributed to the Executive Directors.
23.      For both Projects the procurement of tractors, together with
initial spares would follow the pattern established in the three
preceding agriculture credit projects in Gujarat, Punjab and Andhra
Pradesh. In Tamil Nadu, the State Department of Agriculture and in
Haryana, HAIC will act as procurement executing agencies.    Farmers
would be allowed their choice of tractors from among those for which
quotations were offered by Bank member country suppliers which have
manufacturing facilities in India or which have received the
Government's approval to establish such facilities. Drilling rigs
and earth-moving machinery for the Tamil Nadu Project and harvesters
for the Haryana Project are to be procured under the usual arrangements
for international competitive bidding with Indian suppliers receiving
a margin of preference of 15 percent or the existing level of import
duties, whichever is the less. The prevailing customs duty is 27.5
percent for drilling rigs and zero for harvesters and for earth-
moving machinery for agricultural purposes.    Tractor implements
including hard steel components have been reserved for local procure-
ment. A suggestion that the Association should finance the import of
sufficient hard steel for certain components wias not pursued since
satisfactory administrative arrangements were not practicable. The
Borrower has, however, given assurances that sufficient hard steel,
which is in short supply in India, will be made available to local
manufacturers of the implements required for these Projects.
24.      The banking arrangements for the Tamil Nadu Project are of
particular interest. During the year preceeding appraisal of this
Project a rapid proliferation of LDB Primary Banks in the State raised
questions about the efficiency and financial soundness of the apex
bank; it was feared that many of the new banks would not be suitable
institutions for the channelling of credit. The situation has,
however, stabilized and improved in the last few months. The expansion
of the LDB system has ceased, and a recent survey of such banks in
the project area by ARC reveals that, while some of the LDB Primaries
are unsatisfactory at present,most of these can be improved and it
should be possible for the LDB system to carry out project lending in
most areas. It is recognized by the State Government that ARC will
only refinance Primary Banks meeting agreed criteria and that shortfalls
in the LDB system would be met by channelling funds through selected
commercial banks which are well represented in the project areas. The
preliminary findings of a survey being carried out by ARC indicates that there
wfMllbe sufficient banking facilities to enEure full execution of the Project. The



- 7 -
criteria to be used by ARC in working out arrangements for the
distribution and organization of the Primary LDB's for project lending,
in nominating the Primary LDBs and commercial banks to be responsible
for project lending and in determining the scope and timing of their
participation have been agreed upon during negotiations and set out
in a Supplemental Letter which is being distributed with the other
legal documents. Although the fulfillment of the several requirements
contained in the Credit documents in this respect becomes a prime
responsibility of ARC, the Association reserves the right in Section 8.01
(g) and (h) of the Development Credit Agreement, as a condition of
effectiveness, to be satisfied that ARC's arrangements are such as to
ensure sound management, supervision and financial independence of the
LDB system in the State and that the nominations of banks and the
decisions taken by ARC concerning the scope of their participation
have been taken in accordance with the application of the agreed
criteria. The same situation does not apply in Haryana State where
the LMB is a more effective and experienced institution which has not
been subjected to similar changes.
25.      Considerable differences in the treatment of minor irrigation
investments are also necessary, since Haryana need not apply constraints
that are essential in Tamil Nadu where over-exploitation is a real
danger. In Tamil Nadu, where there is no controlling legislation,
safeguards against the over-exploitation of groundwater resources will
be through the criteria laid down in the Project Agreement relating to
spacing and specifications of wells and also through limitations
imposed on lending by the banks, both inside and outside the project
area. Such restrictions cannot be a full substitute for effective
legislation (which is being discussed for India generally but will
necessarily require some time before being adopted even in individual
States such as Tamil Nadu), but they go a considerable way to achieving
the objectives shared by the State Government and the Association in
this regard. In Haryana, the only measure deemed necessary to safeguard
the investment in minor irrigation is an increase in technical expertise.
During negotiations assurances have been obtained that sufficient
qualified staff will be available in the Haryana Department of
Agriculture, to permit the efficient carrying out of the minor irriga-
tion component of the Project. The appointment by LMB of an
agricultural economist and a chief inspecting officer(who, tgether
with the two inspecting officers already at post, would be responsible
for the overall guidance, control and training of Land Valuation
officers) has been made a condition of effectiveness, to be found in
Section 8.01 (e) of the Development Credit Agreement.
26.      For small farmer beneficiaries of both Projects, terms and
conditiomsof lending for minor irrigation and land levelling are simi-
larlydifferentiated as they were in the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural
Credit Project, i.e., smaller down payment terms and longer maturity
periods. As an inducement to the formation of groups for the exploita-
tion of wells and to promote the proper use of distribution channels



- 8 -
both on and between farms it has also been agreed that Tamil Nadu may
continue to provide Rs. 500 subsidy per well to groups of small
farmers. This subsidy takes the form of a reduction of the
beneficiariest LDB loans, the LDB being reimbursed for that amount
directly by the State Government.
27.      GOI is aware of the Association's concern that an uneconomic
diversion of investment may be caused by the relatively low price of
imported tractors in India. Negotiations under the GATT are being
pursued in order that India may be released from its obligation to
keep tractors on the "zero tariff" list. Once these negotiations
have been concluded IDA expects to enter into discussions with
the Government of India regarding appropriate measures for achieving
an acceptable increase in the rupee price to be paid by farmers for
imported tractors.
28.      The effect of mechanization on rural employment continues to
receive the Association's attention. It is not possible to quantify
the net effect of mechanization on total labor use on the basis of the
evidence available at present. Howiever, there are good indications that
the increased cropping intensity and the probable shift to higher
valued crops in Haryana and Tamil Nadu will create new job opportuni-
ties so that the immediate effect of mechanization will certainly not
be to lessen employment. Furthermore, most of the farm labor
force in the State of Haryana presently owns land (or has some form of
tenancy arrangement), and during peak cultivation and harvest periods
an acute shortage of labor is experienced. These conclusions are
based on a careful assessment of the information presently available.
However, in order to improve the Association's knowledge on the
effects of farm mechanization and in particular regarding the short-
and long-run effects of mechanization on rural unemployment, the
Association and the Government of India have agreed to commission,in
the very near future, a comprehensive study on this subject in two
States, Gujarat and Punjab. This study should provide a more thorough
analysis and fuller information regarding the employment effects of
mechanization in agriculture.
29.      The diversity of agricultural needs and ccnditions in India
is well illustrated by these similar yet contrasting Projects. Both
require measures tailored to their particular circumstances, and what
is appropriate in the one is not necessarily applicable in the other.
Because of ecological variations and institutional differences no
two agricultural credit projects in different geographical areas can
be identical. Some standardization has been achieved where possible,
but however complex the lending mechanism may become in order to cater
for local circumstances, the provision of a comprehensive and
integrated approach to agricultural development remains the central
featureof such projects.

PART III  - LEGAL INSTRUIMTS AND AUTHORITY
30.       The draft Development Credit Agreements between India and the
Association, the draft Project Agreements among the Association and
ARC, LDB, LMB, HAIC and the State of Tamil Nadu acting for its
Agriculture Department, the Agreements between the Association and the
States of Tamil Nadu and Haryana, the draft Supplemental Letter
concerning criteria agreed between the Association and ARC to be applied
in determining the banking structure in Tamil Nadu, the Recommendation
of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed Development Credits are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
31.       The draft Agreements incorporate the relending terms and procure-
ment provisions explained in Part II and paragraph 23 above. The
specific obligations of India regarding the importation of tractors and
other equipment for the Projects are included in Section 3.01 of both
the draft Tamil Nadu Development Credit Agreement and the Haryana
Development Credit Agreement.
32.       In addition to the Conditions of Effectiveness referred to
in paragraph 24, the Taidl Nadu Development Credit Agreement, in
Section 8.01 (d), (e) and (f), contain three other Conditions of
Effectiveness, namely, that direct subsidies for wells shall be
withdrawn, that economic rates are established for mechanized land
levelling services and that the initial staffing of the State Groundwater
Directorate shaU be acceptable to the Association.
PART rV - THE ECCNOMY
33.       The latest economic report entitled "Economic Situation and
Prospects of India" (SA-25) is boing distributed this week. It reports
the continuation of many of the encouraging trends observed in the 1970
report - in particular the further growth of exports and of agricul-
tural production. The report also notes that net aid receipts have
fallen to a level lower than at any time in the past decade, and are
less than one-third of the peak reached five years ago. The
resulting shortage of resources has been reflected in a shortfall of
investment from the planned level, which seems to be the bare minimum
required if India is to achieve a tolerable rate of growth. India
continues to need substantial aid on concessionary terms.



- 10 -
PART V  - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREPEMNT
34.      I am satisfied that the proposed Credits would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
35.      I reconmmend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credits.
