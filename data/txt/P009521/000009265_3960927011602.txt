MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR AN EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed "redit to Bangladesh for SDR 19.4
million (US$25 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
Credit would be on standard International Development Association (IDA) terms
with a maturity of 40 years and would help finance an Export Development Project.
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will provide a
grant of US$1.2 million for technical assistance.
2.       Background.  Bangladesh's manufacturing sector is small and at an early
stage of development, accounting for about 102 of GDP and 8Z of total employment.
Despite its small size and uneven growth rates, the manufacturing sector plays a
prominent role in the country's external trade, and its expansion is essential to
provide employment for Bangladesh's large and rapidly growing population. About
one-third of manufacturing value added originates in export activities, and the
sector accounts for over three-fourths of total merchandise exports. Exports
grew at about 82 during FY81-FY88, with nontraditional exports growing at an
average annual rate of about 292, compared to only about 12 for traditional
exports, comprising mostly jute, jute goods and tea. The New Industrial Policy
(NIP) in 1982 and the Revised Industrial Policy in 1986 introduced reforms to
promote export-oriented private sector manufacturing through deregulation,
liberalization of import policies and procedures, easing of investment approval
procedures, privatization, and the introduction of incentives to promote exports
through maintaining a flexible exchange rate, introducing duty-free imported
inputs and improving access to preshipment financing. The NIP reforms
incorporated the results of IDA-financed (Cr. 1124-BD) industrial and trade
policy studies, and the Industrial Sector Credit (ISC)(Cr. 1816-BD) supported the
reform program's implementation during 1986-88. These reforms, together with
financial sectot reforms (including interest rate liberalization) to be supported
through a proposed Financial Sector Credit (tentatively scheduled for FY89) and
continuing liberalization of exchange rates agreed by the Government with the
International Monetarv Fund and IDA, are expected to encourage efficient,
sustained industrial development.
3.       Under the ISC, the Government: (a) introduced the use of a generalized
inland letter of credit (LIC) to extend foreign currency export financing to
indirect exporters (i.e. those providing inputs to exporters); (b) established a
Duty Exemption Drawback Office (DEDO) to facilitate exporters' free-trade access
to imported inputs; (c) strengthened the existing export credit guarantee scheme
to facilitate new exporters' access to financing; and (d) established an Export
Monitoring Unit to ensure timely fulfillment of Bangladesh's international
quotas. Although these actions improved the procedures and policy environment
for exporting, experience under the ISC has shown that further technical support
is needed to ensure effective, sustained implementation. Moreover, in FY87 a
Bangladesh Bank (BB) Task Force on Export Finance reported that exporters' lack
of foreign exchange preshipment financing was an important constraint in export
development. At present access to credit is impeded by, inter alia, the lack of
financial instruments to address indirect exr cters' credit needs, the low
administered interest rates, the export credit. guarantee scheme's institutional



-2-
weakness, the conservatism of commercial banks, their inability to assess risks,
and an interest rate structure which fails to reflect costs and risks. Although
access to foreign currency does not currently appear to constrain exports because
of Bangladesh's recent favorable foreign exchange reserves, the Task Force
recognized that the trade regime liberalization implemented under the ISC would
foster a greater flow of imports which could quickly erode much ol the present
reserves, and noted that Bangladesh has historically had wide variations in the
availability of foreign exchange due to recurrent natural disasters and terms of
trade deterioration. While the fundamental issues of new exporters' access to
credit and the cost of foreign currency credits are to be addressed through
ongoing or proposed financial sector and exchange rate policy reforms, the Task
Force acknowledged that these reforms would take time and recommended that the
Government establish an Export Development Fund (EDF) during the transition to
provide foreign currency loans to meet exporters' financing needs for imported
inputs.  The Government believes that such a fund would provide exporters with a
reliable source of foreign e-change and signal its commitment to promote exports.
4.       Subsidiary Loan Agreements.  In late FY88 IDA learned that the
Government had not been implementing the subsidiary loan agreements' onlending
terms and conditions for commercial entities under ongoing IDA credits, Asian
Development Bank loans and loans from various bilateral donors. For IDA credits,
the Government has required entities, with few exceptions, to make interest
payments and repayments of principal on the same terms as the Government
repayments to IDA, rather than in accordance with the subsidiary loan agreements.
With IDA's agreement, the Government has adopted the following action plan to
address this issue for IDA credits. Beginning with their FY89 accounts, all
entities were instructed to record in their financial statements payments of
interest and principal in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
subsidiary loan agreements, and would be in compliance with the subsidiary loan
agreements. Further, the Government has decided that all of the arrears of
energy sector entities as of June 30, 1988 will be converted into equity, and it
will fully implement this decision by June 30, 1989. For the outstanding arrears
under the subsidiary loan agreements for all other entities, the Government has
decided to eithar convert them into equity or to reschedule repayments depending
upon the financial circumstances of each entity. The Government will finalize
its decision for each entity by June 30, 1989 and implement it immediately
thereafter. Future compliance with the terms and conditions of the subsidiary
loan agreements will be monitored closely by supervision missions.
5.       Rationale for IDA Involve'.nent.  IDA has worked closely with the
Government to develop and implement a significant program of trade and industrial
policy reform. Progress under the ongoing ISC is satisfactory and the proposed
Project presents an opportunity to focus on export development by providing
support to the Government to further rationalize its export policies and
procedures and to strengthen Bangladesh's export administration agencies while
continuing its trade, industrial, financial and exchange rate reforms which are
crucial for the industrial sector's efficient, rapid and sustainable growth. The
proposed Project is an important link in the sequence of Bank Group industrial
sector operations and would continue and complement IDA's involvement with the
Government in export development under the Seventh and Eighth Import Program
Credits (Cr. 866-BD and Cr. 980-BD) and the ISC.
6.       Proiect Obiectives.  The overall objectives of the propesed Project are
to: (a) provide preshipment credit to private sector exporters, particularly to
new nontraditional exporters; (b) strengthen the export financing and guarantee
elements of the credit delivery system; and (c) address policy and procedural
issues which constrain the active development of Bangladesh's export potential.



-3-
More specific objectives are to refine the use of the inland LIC, improve the
duty drawback system for both direct and indirect exporters, continue the
building up of Bangladesh's export administration agencies, expand the use of the
export credit guarantee scheme, and provide training to Government and agency
staff involved in export promotion and development. The proposed Project also
responds to the Government's request to support its continuing policy and
institutional reforms in the trade, industrial and financial sectors.
7.       Project Description.  The proposed Project would provide a line of
credit to augment the Government's resources in an EDF and funding for a
comprehensive technical assistance program. The fund would help meet exporters'
foreign exchange loan requirements for imported inputs, while the technical
assistance program would provide funding for the: (a) BB. to expand the
implementation of the inland L/C system; (b) DEDO, to improve thc duty drawback
system, particularly in processing of drawback claims; (c) Export Credit
Guarantee Wing (ECGW), to strengthen the export credit guarantee scheme; and
(d) Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), to strengthen its monitoring system for
exports subject to international quotas. The total cost is expected to be
US$31.2 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$30.7 million
equivalent (99Z). The proposed IDA Credit of US$25 million equivalent would
supplement a Government contribution of US$5 million equivalent. USAID would
provide a grant for US$1.2 million equivalent for the technical assistance
program. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Schedule B shows the estimated amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, as well as the disbursement schedule. The proposed Project is
conservatively estimated to be carried out over three and a half years. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Bangladesh are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7368-BD, dated March 22, 1989 is being distributed
separately.
8.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has issued Lending Policies and
Operating Procedures for the EDF (BB Circular No. 29, dated December 7, 1988)
which are satisfactory to IDA. and has provided IDA with a written commitment to
contribute US$5 million equivalent to the fund. It has also approved the
Technical Assistance Project Proformas and agreed in principle with USAID for
grant financing of technical assistance to BB, DEDO, ECGW and EPB. Further, the
Government has agreed: (a) to contribute an amount equivalent to US$3 million to
initiate the EDF and to deposit the balance of its contribution of US$2 million
equivalent before July 1, 1990; (b) to cause Sadharan Bima Corporation (SBC) to:
(i) prepare a study by June 30, 1990 to review its export credit insurance
policies; (ii) by September 30, 1990, provide IDA with an action program to
implement a comprehensive training program for ECGW staff and to enhance ECGW's
financial viability and operational autonomy within SBC; and (iii) to authorize,
prior to the end of each fiscal year beginning FY90, adequate levels of ECGW
administrative expenditures (including promotional expenditures) in consultation
with IDA; (c) that the EDF would retain both repayments made to it and profits
generated from its operations to be reused by eligible exporters; (d) that US$6
million equivalent would be earmarked for new nontraditional exporters; (e) that
the Government and IDA would review the demand for the EDF annually beginning
January 31, 1990, including the earmarked amount for new nontraditional
exporters, and if demand for the latter is found to be low during these reviews,
the Govertnment would initiate remedial efforts; (f) that if insufficient demand
for the earmarked funds continues, BB would, in consultation with IDA, reallocate
them to the general EDF for use by all eligible exporters; (g) that if the demand
for the EDF substantially exceeds the funds available, the Government would



-4-
contribute additional foreign exchange to the EDF, equivalent to 202 of the
annual excess demand or such adequate amounts as the Government would determine
in consultation with IDA up to a maximum of US$10 million equivslent; (h) that a
joint Government/IDA review would be conducted on or about December 31, 1992 to
determine if the EDF should continue; and (i) that each of the participants in
the overseas training would be required to submit a study plan for IDA's and
USAID's approval, to remain in a relevant institution according to the
Government's regulations on overseas training to carry out the functions for
which training was provided, and to prepare a report on the lessons from the
training for the supervisor, IDA and USAID. The Government's establishment of
the EDP and the initiation of i s operations with a minimum Government
contribution of US$3 million equivalent and the Government's securing of USAID's
agreement to provide required grant funding for technical assistance are
conditions of Credit effectiveness.
9.       Benefits.  The proposed Project would promote and diversify Bangladesh's
exports. The credit component would facilitate existing and prospective
exporters' access to a steadily available source of foreign exchange preshipment
credit for imported inputs by augmenting EDF resources and earmarking 20? of the
EDF for new nontraditional exporters. Through the comprehensive technical
assistance program, the proposed Project would strengthen the ECGW and improve
the access to imported inputs through a more efficient duty drawback system. It
would also stimulate the development of backward linkages from nontraditional
exports and increase the value added in export activity by promoting the use of
inland L/Cs for indirect exporters.
10.      Risks.  The success of the credit component would depend on BB's
effective operation of the EDF. The risk is manageable as satisfactory policies
and procedures would be in place. The risk that the EDF would merely substitute
cheaper credit for exporters who would export anyway is being minimized by
careful formulation of eligibility criteria, annual reviews of demand for its
funds and a joint formal review by Government/IDA on or about December 31, 1992
to ensure that it continues to be needed. Commercial banks' interest in the EDF
is being encouraged by giving them attractive spreads, including a spread
differential to encourage them to lend to new nontraditional exporters. In the
area of policy, procedural and institutional reform, the risk of ineffective
technical assistance implementation to upgrade export administration institutions
is being minimized through careful technical assistance formulation with the full
participation of each of the institutions involved, close supervision by IDA and
USAID, and the appointment of an expatriate technical assistance coordinator.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROCUREMENT METHOD AND DISBURSEMENTS
Procurement. Exporters would follow normal commercial practice
for procurement of raw materials and other imported inputs from countries
and territories referred to in the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Since
procurement for imports financed by subloans would depend on the decisions
by many enterprises for a large number of items, and given that timing is
of crucial importance in executing export orders, international competitive
bidding is not practical. Except for proprietary items, subborrowers from
the EDF will be required to procure goods through competitive shopping,
which would include invitation of quotations from no fewer than three
suppliers. Goods estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$25,000
per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the equivalent of
US$5 million, could be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of the
normal procurement procedures of the purchaser of such goods. Contracts
for proprietary items could be let on a negotiated basis, but award of such
contracts would be subject to prior approval by IDA. Commercial banks
would disburse EDF subloans directly to foreign suppliers or domestic
suppliers upon the negotiation of import L/Cs or inland L/Cs, respectively.
EDF Operating Policies and Procedures provide that the commercial banks
require subborrowars follow competitive shopping procedures, and BB would
ensure that commercial banks follvw such practice as part of its bank
supervision activities.
