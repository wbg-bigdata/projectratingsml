PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 678-YU)
Preface
This is a Project Performance Audit Report on the Yugoslavia Fourth
Highway Project for which Loan 678-YU in the amount of US$40 million was
closed in January 1976. The report consists of a Project Performance Audit
Memorandum prepared by Operations Evaluation Department (OED) and a Project
Completion Report (PCR) prepared by the Bank's Europe, Middle East and North
Africa Regional Office. The memorandum is based primarily on the PCR, in
which certain revisions have been incorporated after discussions with OED.
Also discussions have been held with Bank staff, the Minutes of the Board of
Executive Directors meeting which considered the project has been read and
other documents briefly reviewed.
On that basis, under OED's abbreviated review process, the audit
accepts most of the conclusions of the PCR. However, it also expands upon
the impact of international competitive bidding, the difficulties encountered
in securing right-of-way and in locating roads in densely-populated areas,
and the importance for decision making of adequate origin-destination traffic
forecasts.
No mission by OED staff was made in connection with this performance
audit report.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 678-YU)
Highlights
Loan 678-YU was intended to help finance the construction of 6
two-lane highway sections (218 km) on four main trunk roads. The project
was completed about three years later than expected with a cost overrun
in local currency of 39% attributable largely to rapid inflation. The
major sources of delay were disagreement over access road alignments, dif-
ficulties in securing the right-of-way, unfavorable geological conditions
and postponement of the asphalt wearing course to allow a smoother riding
surface on one road. The rates of return at audit on the highway sections
of between 12% and 22% compare favorably with the appraisal expectations.
Most of the loan covenants of the project were successfully fulfilled.
The following might be of special interest:
Efforts of the Bank to improve international competitive bidding
procedures, which helped ensure more effective competition
between local and foreign contractors (paras. 8-9, 16 and PCR,
paras. 4.04-4.05, 4.07 and 4.15)
Difficulties in securing right-of-way and of locating roads par-
ticularly in densely-populated areas (paras. 10-11, 17 and
PCR, paras. 4.20, 4.26-4.27)
Importance of reliable traffic data in selecting road alignment
(paras. 12-14, 17 and PCR, paras. 6.04, 6.10 and 8.03).






PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
YUGOSLAVIA FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 678-YU)
I. Background
1.        The project supported by Loan 678-YU of May 19, 1970, for US$40 mil-
lion was the Bank's fourth investment in Yugoslavia's highway sector.    The
first three projects, Loan 344-YU of 1963 for US$35 million, Loan 485-YU of
1967 for US$10 million, and Loan 608-YU of 1969 for US$30 million assisted
the construction of various highway sections (PCR, paras. 1.01-1.02). Prog-
ress under the First and Third Highway Projects has been assessed in OED's
"Comparative Evaluation of Selected Highway Projects" (Report No. 349) and
"Project Performance Audit Report on Yugoslavia Third Highway Project, Loan
608&YU" (Report No. 1385).
2.        The Fourth Highway Project financed construction of 6 two-lane
highway sections on the following principal trunk roads:
(a)  Bar-Ulcinj (25 km);
(b)  Belgrade-Novisad (59 km);
(c)  Pec-Pristina-Nis (69 km); and
(d) 'Sarajevo-Zenica (65 km) (see PCR, Map 1).
These sections formed part of a larger program of major highway improvements
submitted to the Bank in September 1968 during the appraisal of the Third
Highway Project. Because final engineering at that time was not sufficiently
advanced, their inclusion was postponed to the Fourth Highway Project (PCR,
paras. 3.01-3.04). The remaining sections of the program of highway improve-
ments were financed by the subsequent Fifth Highway Project supported by Loan
751-YU of 1971 for US$35 million.
II. Project Results
3.        The project was completed in September 1976, about three years after
the appraisal forecast of December 1973. The completion of all four roads
was delayed. The Bar-Ulcinj Road was completed about six months later than
expected because of inclement weather and unfavorable geological conditions
(PCR, para. 4.05). The Belgrade-Novisad Road and the Sarajevo-Zenica Road
were completed about two years after the appraisal forecast because of dis-
agreement over access road alignments and difficulties in securing the right-
of-way. Finally, although the Pec-Pristina-Nis Road was opened to traffic,
completion of works was delayed by nearly three years because laying the
wearing course was postponed to allow for a smoother riding surface.

4.        The total project cost of Din 1,696.3 million US$106.8 million)
represents an overrun in local currency of 39% above the appraisal forecast
of Din 1,217.9 million (US$97.5 million). The overrun expressed in foreign
currency of 10% is smaller because of exchange rate fluctuations occurring
since the time of appraisal. Final costs of the Bar-Ulcinj, Belgrade-Novisad,
Pec-Pristina-Nis and Zenica-Sarajevo roads were overrun by 18%, 58%, 31%
and 32%, respectively. Most of the overrun is explained by the rapid rate
of inflation in Yugoslavia since 1970. In addition, extra work was required
on the Belgrade-Novisad Road, particularly with respect to the bridge cross-
ing the Danube, and technical difficulties made some redesign necessary on
the Pec-Pristina-Nis Road.
5.        The economic justification of the roads at appraisal was based on
expected vehicle operating cost savings. A reassessment of the justification
is made in the attached PCR based on actual construction costs and traffic
data and on new estimates of vehicle operating cost savings. The audit
rates of return are equal to or higher than expected for three of the roads,
while the rate of return for the fourth road is lower than expected but still
above 10%.

6.        All of the roads have benefitted from higher than expected vehicle
operating cost savings resulting from the increase in oil prices. In addi-
tion, traffic has been greater than expected on two of the roads, Bar-Ulcinj
and Sarajevo-Zenica, explaining the higher than expected rates of return of
22% and 15%. In the case of the other two roads, there have been substantial
traffic shortfalls. This overestimation of traffic was particularly impor-
tant in the northern section of the Belgrade-Novisad Road (PCR, paras. 6.02-
6.06) and is analyzed in Section III below.
7.        For the most part, the loan covenants of the project vere complied
with. The Government's undertaking to complete and maintain roads which
provided access to the project roads however was delayed in the case of the
Belgrade-Novisad Road. The new access from the Belgrade-Zagreb Road in fact
will not be completed until mid-1977. Performance with respect to the loan
covenants is discussed fully in the PCR (paras. 4.24-4.29).

III. Main Issues
International Competitive Bidding
8.        From the First through the Seventh Highway Projects, the Bank has
required international competitive bidding and has tried to remove any dif-
ficulties presented by Yugoslavia's own practices. For instance, under the
Third Hligiway Project the Bank noted that foreign firms which had prequali-
fied had not submitted bids. It discussed this situation with the foreign
firms involved and found that they considered the bidding period too short
(60 days) and that the bidding documents were prepared in a language not com-
monly spoken abroad, Serbo-Croatian. Under the Fourth Highway Project, the
Bank recommended that the bidding period be extended and that documents be
prepared in English as well. Furthermore, the Bank suggested that an annex
be affixed to the bidding documents with information on foreign currency
transfers, exchange risk and price escalation to give prospective bidders
more infor-ation in areas which might be of concern to them. In spite of
these efforts, however, awards have consistently been made to local con-
tractors; an exception is the award of a subcontract to an Italian firm
under the Fifth Highway Project, Loan 751-YU of 1971 for US$35 million.
9.        The award of practically all contracts to local firms in the Bank-
financed projects reflects the competitiveness of the contracting industry
in Yugoslavia. Nonetheless, the Bank's efforts have served to clarify aspects
of competitive bidding in Yugoslavia which might have inhibited foreign con-
tractors and these efforts continue to ensure competitiveness among local and
foreign contractors.
Securing Right-of-Way and Road Location
10.       Difficulty in acquirinc the right-of-way and in reaching agreement
on the location of portions of the Sarajevo-Zenica and Belgrade-Novisad roads,
particularly those portions in densely populated areas, delayed construction.
In the case of the former, obtaining the right-of-way delayed the beginning of
construction by about a year and even after the necessary land was obtained,
relocation of people whose homes were in the path of the road continued to
cause-delays. In the case of the Novisad-Belgrade Road, although the location
of an access road (into Novisad) and an interchange (near Belgrade) had been
approved by authorities, the decision was overturned after the loan/credit
was signed, substantially delaying work.   Bank experience in other countries
such as JiJaica and Finland, also illustrates the difficulties and delays
which can occur when roads pass through densely populated areas. In the case
of the Kingston-Spanish Town Road in Jamaica,, right-of-way and relocation
difficulties in the urban portion of the road were underestimated at appraisal,
while in the instance of the Tattariharju-Jarvenpaa Expressway in Finland, the
alignment near an urban area was modified when local communities lobbied to



-4 -
alter it after appraisal. 1/ These experiences indicate the need for better
communication between the parties involved and the desirability of reaching
decisions on alignment and right-of-way acquisition before the loan is made.
11.       The Yugoslav case however is somewhat different in that assurances
were made to the Bank that right-of-way and location had been settled before
negotiations. Similar situations have also occurred in the Fifth, Sixth and
Seventh Highway Projects and stem from the decentralization of authority
in Yugoslavia which enables bodies such as communities and interest groups
to appeal and overturn decisions on location and right-of-way after they
have been taken. There seems to be no easy solution to this problem but
more communication between all groups concerned earlier might be beneficial.
Importance of Traffic Studies in Selecting Alignments
12.       The experience on the Belgrade-Novisad Road illustrates the impor-
Lance of adequate traffic data when determining road alignment. At appraisal,
the alignment of the Belgrade-Novisad Road was the subject of contention by
groups which wanted the route to pass through Novisad. Three possible align-
ments were studied:
(a) a route located to the east of Novisad which crossed a
relatively sparsely populated region with flat, rolling
terrain;
(b) a route to the west of Novisad which crossed a mountainous
region entailing high costs; and
(c) a route through Novisad along an existing road which passed
the densely populated regions around the city where right-of-
way acquisition would have proven difficult (see Map 2).
The first alternative (a) was selected because its cost was lower and con-
struction would be easier.
13.       During project implementation, the Bank discovered that the city
of Novisad was proceeding with plans to construct a route which would branch
off and parallel the Belgrade-Novisad Road between Indija and Novisad, a
distance of about 30 km. This new route, now about 25% completed, will pass
through Novisad and serve the populated region south of the city. Actual
traffic on the Belgrade-Novisad Road in 1975 was only 78% of the appraisal
forecast and traffic on the northern half between Indija and Novisad is
likely to decrease even more when the parallel route is completed. By 1980,
traffic on the northern section of the Bank-financed route will decline to

3,035 vehicles per day whereas traffic on the parallel route is expected to
reach 8,416 according to a 1975 feasibility study of the transport corridor
between Belgrade, Novisad. and Feketic. The PCR expects that the rate of
return on the northern half of the Bank-financed road, comprising over half
of the cost of the Belgrade-Novisad Road of US$40 million, will be 6%. In
view of this, construction of the second carriageway of the Belgrade-Novisad
Road, which was planned at appraisal, is no longer justified.
14.       Based on the information available at appraisal, the decision to
construct the Bank-financed route appears to have been the correct one. How-
ever, in retrospect the information upon which this decision was based was
apparently insufficient. The present level of traffic on the Bank-financed
road between Indija and Novisad and the expectation that much of this traffic
will divert to the new route when it is completed, suggests that the origin-
destination studies undertaken at appraisal did not consider the needs of
the communities around Novisad. Another instance where origin-destination
studies may not have given adequate attention to local traffic needs is the
Zagreb-Karlovac Road reviewed by the Project Performance Audit Report of the
Third Highway Project (Report No. 1385, para. 12). Traffic on the Zagreb-
Karlovac Road was 64% less than the appraisal forecast mainly because in-
vestments to expand the Port of Rijeka did not materialize. However, as
Report No. 1385 points out, a substantial amount of traffic continues to
use an old, unimproved route which passes through many communities. Since
the Zagreb-Karlovac Road is a limited-access highway, this seems to indi-
cate that the needs of the communities between Zagreb and Karlovac were
not thoroughly explored.
IV. Conclusions
15.       Construction of the project roads was successfully completed in
spite of delays caused by postponement of paving and dispute over right-of-way
and location. The quality of construction which was undertaken by local
contractors is generally good. Cost overruns for the roads are largely
attributable to rapid inflation since the time of appraisal. The economic
rates of return for the project roads range between 12%-22% and compare
favorably with the appraisal estimates. The loan covenants were substan-
tially complied with although an undertaking to construct access roads was
considerably delayed in execution.
16.       The audit notes that construction awards under virtually all of
the seven Bank-financed highway projects have gone to local contractors. The
Bank took an active role in promoting effective international competitive
bidding. The fact that awards continue to be made to local contractors
reflects the competitiveness of the local construction industry.
17.       The difficulty in securing right-of-way and agreeing on road loca-
tion, as in the case of Sarajevo-Zenica and Belgrade-Novisad roads, is a
problem affecting a number of Bank-financed highway projects in Yugoslavia.



-6-
The Bank has tried to ensure that location and right-of-way are agreed upon
before negotiations; however, the appelate procedure is such that apparently,
firm decisions can be overturned. While there is no ready panacea for the
problem, more communication between the communes and republics involved at an
earlier stage might be beneficial. In the case of the Belgrade-Novisad Road,
information suggests that reliable origin-destination traffic studies before
appraisal might have resulted in a different decision on the road's alignment.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA: FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 678-YU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1968 to meet the urgent need for better facilities, the Federal
Government of Yugoslavia drew up an extensive program for highway improve-
ments and submitted it to the Bank for consideration. In June 1969 the Bank
approved a loan for $30 million under the Third Highway Project, Loan 608-YU,
to help finance three high priority sections included in the program. The
Fourth Highway Project, involving construction of six sections of four
major highways, was also a part of the same program, for which Loan 678-YU
of May 28, 1970, in the amount of $40.0 million, closed in January 1976.
1.02      The Bank had earlier financed two other highway projects in
Yugoslavia - Loan Nos. 344-YU in 1963 and 485-YU in 1967. The First Highway
Project (US$35 million) was financed for the completion of the coastal sec-
tion of the Adriatic highway and parts of the Belgrade-Nis road. The
Second Highway Project (US$10 million) was for the improvement of 367 km
of roads connecting the Zagreb-Belgrade highway via Sarajevo and Tuzla with
the Adriatic highway. All these projects were satisfactorily completed.
1.03      The Project Completion Report is based on information contained
in the Project Appraisal Report (No. PTR-41a, May 5, 1970) and a review
of Bank files, including supervision and progress reports of the project.
II. SECTOR BACKGROUND
2.01      Transport is a dynamic sector of the Yugoslav economy.    Govern-
ment's broad aim is to ensure that all modes of transport are developed to
meet the needs of a market-oriented economy. The railways are important
carriers of goods and passengers, but since the mid'60s road transport has
gained in relative importance and has replaced railways as the dominant
carrier. River transport has retained an important' and competitive place,
and pipelines have come into increasing use in recent years.
2.02      Yugoslavia aims to improve its integration with the world economy.
The trunk routes and international connections are therefore of special
concern because Yugoslavia has borders with seven countries. Several inter-
national land connections, particularly in the northwest, have also acquired
special significance for tourism.
2.03      The attainment of regional balance in economic developmev hlas
always been an explicit objective of Yugoslavia. Increasing emph is is
now laid on the development of transport between developed and less
developed Republics and Provinces and within less developed areas.



- A.2 -
2.04      Development of the highway network has, however, not kept pace
with the growth of road traffic. On many of the main routes the combina-
tion of substandard geometric and pavement conditions with high traffic
volumes has resulted in heavy traffic congestion, while on many other
routes driving conditions are poor and deteriorating. In general, most
of the roads are inadequate for the traffic they are now carrying.
III. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
3.01      In October 1968 Government submitted to a Bank mission, appraising
a Third Highway Project, a list of 13 major roads totalling about 630 km,
then estimated to cost about US$275 million. Planning for most of them was
well advanced and it was anticipated that final designs for all would be
ready early in 1970. All proposals appeared of high priority. The Third
Highway Project (US$30 million) financed construction of only three of the
13 road sections. At the Bank's request, therefore, Government selected
from the program a number of highway sections which might be considered
for the Fourth Project. The basis of selection was to be high economic
priority and an advanced status of project preparation. Government, how-
ever, deferred consideration of projects in Macedonia and Slovenia as those
Republics were receiving assistance under the Third Loan and would be suf-
ficiently occupied with the administration and execution of that project.
3.02      Preparation of the project road studies was undertaken by the high-
way organizations of the Republic and Provinces assisted by the Design Insti-
tutes of Belgrade and Sarajevo and the Materials Testing Institute of Belgrade.
Ad hoc assistance and advice in the execution of this work was also given by
Bank missions.
3.03      The project identified was the project appraised and built; there
were no changes in composition.
3.04      The project was processed efficiently and without unnecessary delay.
The decision within the Bank to increase the loan amount from US$30 million
to US$40 million was taken speedily, when prior to project appraisal it was
seen that the original allocation would be inadequate to finance a balanced
project. In less than two years from the July 1968 initial request by
Government, two loans had been signed supporting its road construction
program: the Third Road Loan for US$30 million on June 5, 1969 and the
Fourth for US$40 million on May 28, 1970. From completion of the project's
appraisal to its presentation to the Board, less than seven months elapsed.
Given that loan negotiations were not completed until mid-April, it would
have been difficult to advance the date of Board presentation of the project.



- A.3
IV.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
A.   General
4.01      The project consisted of the construction of six two-lane sections
(218 km) of four principal highways in five of the Republics and Autonomous
Provinces of Yugoslavia (Map IBRD-2770R). They are:
Project Highway        Republic/Province           Executing Agency
Bar-Ulcinj         25 km    Montenegro            Road Maintenance Enterprise
of Montenegro
Belgrade-Novisad   59 km    Serbia/Vojvodina      Road Council of the Province
of Vojvodina
Pec-Pristina-Nis   69 km    Serbia/Kosovo         Road Maintenance Enterprise of
the Province of Kosovo
Sarajevo-Zenica    65 km    Bosnia-Herzegovina    Road Fund of Bosnia-Herzegovina
4.02      All six sections are part of important trunk highways.    The sections
Belgrade-Novisad and Sarajevo-Zenica constitute the first stages (two lanes)
of subsequent four-lane divided highways and were designed to relieve conges-
tion on the original roads whose geometric standards were inadequate to the
needs of modern traffic. The section Bar-Ulcinj extends the Adriatic highway
along the coast and opens up an area important for tourism, replacing a low-
standard gravel/earth road which suffers severe congestion during the summer
months.
4;.03     The three sections of the Pec-Pristina-Nis highway would complete
the improvement of this important route, construction of which has been in
progress for the past several years.
B.   Project Execution
4.04      The loan became effective on February 8, 1971, more than five months
later than the August 31 anticipated date. Delays in obtaining valid legal
opinion concerning the Subsidiary Loan Agreement as well as the Decision on
Financing was the cause of repeated postponements of the loan effectiveness
deadline. In the meantime, prequalification of contractors who would wish
to bid for the project contracts was in hand, the deadline for which was
set at August 25, 1970. Twenty-five firms responded; four were foreign (two
German, two Italian) and the remainder was Yugoslav. None of the four pre-
qualified foreign contractors participated in bidding for any of the project
contracts. Annex 1 gives details of project execution.



- A.4 -
Bar-Ulcinj Section
4.05      Bids closed for the two contracts of the Bar-Ulcinj road on
January 5, 1971. Seven Yugoslav firms participated and the contracts were
awarded to the lowest evaluated bidders. The Bank cabled its concurrence
with the awards on March 4, 1971.
4.06      The first road to be finished, Bar-Ulcinj, over-ran the 23 month
contract period by 4 1/2 months. The main causes of delay were:
(a) unfavorable and unanticipated geological conditions resulting
in unstable side-slopes in cuttings. To prevent slides,
side-slopes had to be flattened and in some cases retaining
walls built; and
(b) extended periods of abnormally wet weather which slowed the
pace of construction and aggravated the slide problems.
Belgrade-Novisad Section
4.07      Five Yugoslav contractors participated in the bidding for the
three contracts of the Novisad-Batajnica section of the Novisad-Belgrade
highway. In a May 20, 1971 letter, the Bank agreed contract awards to the
lowest evaluated bidders. Because of delays in finalizing the Belgrade
intersection design, award of the contract for the section of this highway
within Serbia (Batajnica-Belgrade), was not made until December 1971. Local
contractors only participated in the bidding although bidding was open to
all prequalified contractors.
4.08      The Novi Sad-Belgrade road was completed in November 1975.    This
road was originally proposed for inclusion in the earlier Third Highway
Project but could not be appraised at that time because a decision on its
northern alignment, and in particular the location of the access from it
to Novi Sad--issues which had been hotly debated in Vojvodina for several
years--could not be reached in time. The road was included in Government's
proposals for the Fourth Highway Project on the understanding that these
problems would be resolved before the appraisal mission's visit. The
mission reviewed the proposals and reached an understanding with the Road
Fund and the Executive Council on the best economic alternative for the
access road. However, during loan negotiations the Vojvodina delegation
informed the Bank that the city of Novi Sad had rejected this alternative,
but that the Road Fund had prepared a slightly different alternative, which
would lie outside the city's jurisdiction. This alternative was acceptable,
and was included in the subsidiary loan agreement.
4.09      A condition precedent to loan effectivenebs was the submission to
the Bank of an acceptable Financing Decision by the Autonoi_ous Province of
Vojvodina. This Decision is the Act passed by the AssemL;ly appi pri- ng
funds for construction of the project. During the Bank's scrutin- L tihis
Act, it was found that not only had the agreed access to the city b2on



- A.5 -
provided for, but the city had also obtained about US$10.0 million for
the construction of an additional access route. Subsequent discussions
and correspondence with Vojvodina clarifying these matters delayed the
Bank's agreement to contract awards until May 20, 1971.
4.10      There were also considerable delays in the contract award for
the approximately 6 km section of this road in Serbia. These delays
were mainly due to problems of designing the Belgrade intersection;
construction did not start, therefore, until June 1972.
4.11      The road throughout had been designed and built as the first
stage of a limited access four-lane highway. Only the first two-lane
carriageway has been built but on some sections earthworks have been
partially completed for the future second two-lane carriageway. Because
of difficulties of extending them at a later date, all crossing structures
have been btiilt spanning both carriageways.
4.12      Vojvodina, in a July 9, 1973 letter, informed the Bank that its
Executive Council had decided to build another highway to Novi Sad from
the project road. The result of this construction, now in progress, will
be to provide an alternative route to Novi Sad and reduce benefits on the
northern 30 km of the project road. Construction of the second carriageway
for this section of the project road, therefore, is not presently foreseeable.
4.13      In view of.the investment already made to provide for a future
second carriageway, the question of an entirely new alignment to provide
for second-stage traffic is one that should have been discussed very much
earlier with the Bank-so that the optimal least total cost solution could
have been mutually agreed.
4.14      It is-of interest to record that the bridge spanning the Danube
river, built as part of this project road, is 2,475 m long with a main span
of 450 m, and is reportedly.the longest in Europe.
Pec-Pristina-Nis Section
4.15      Bids for the five contracts of the Pec-Pristina-Nis road were
opened on March 10, 1971. Six<Yugoslav firms participated, and the contracts
were awarded to the lowest evaluated bidders, the Bank concurring in a letter
of April 26, 1971.
4.16      The first contract of the Pec-Pristina-Pepeljevac road to be com-
pleted was that for the Komorane-Velika Slatina section. Work finished
about three months late, the delay being mainly due to lost time through
wet weather.
4.17      Wet weather and design changes because of unfavorable soil condi-
tions found after construction had started, delayed completion of the
Pec-Zaimovo section.



- A.6 -
4.18      The Podujevo-Merdare section was opened to traffic one month after
the original contract period expired-. The final contract for the road, that
for Merdare-Pepeljevac, was incomplete at'the loan closing date, although the
road was open to traffic on the asphalt binder course. The laying of the
asphalt wearing course was postponed beyond the loan closing date to allow a
reasonable period for settlements to occur.. It was completed by September
1976. However, on'the'basis of work actually completed, the full provision of
funds under Category III of the loan was disbursed and the Bank's financial
commitment to the project completed.
Sarajevo-Zenica Section
4.19      The principal cause of delay in completing the Sarajevo-Zenica
road in Bosnia-Hlerzegovina was the problem-of land expropriation and the
relocation of people and utilities from the right-of-way. Although work
was about to start in June 1972, a year af'ter contract award, relocation
problems persisted and slowed progress so that the project was not completed
until lat-e December 1975.
C.   Time Schedule
4.20      AllP'construction contracts took longer than anticipated to complete.
Building the project roads consumed about 560 contract months compared with
the 365 contract months allocated for the work, a total time over-run of
more than 50%.   While the causes of some delays were unforeseeable--prolonged
periods of abnormally wet weather, pockets of unsuitable material encountered
on the alignment--others could have been anticipated and dealt with in
advance. In particular the progress of the Sarajevo-Zenica road could have
been held to schedule had land expropriation action been taken earlier.
Simiarly, the Batajnica-Belgrade section of the Novisad road could have
been completed at the same time as the rest of the road if urban planning
problems in Belgrade had been taken into account in the initial intersection
design. Nevertheless, it is clear that more generouis contract construction
periods would have been appropriate.
D.   Costs
4.21      Despite the effects of the devaluation of the dinar and the high
rate of inflation rate after 1970, the project costs increased only marginally
from the US$97.5 million estimated to US$106.8 million (Annex 2).
E.   Quality of Completed Work
4.22      Generally, quality of workmanship throughout was good.    However,
supervision missions reported that the standard of finish of structures was
lower in Kosovo than elsewhere, but was still acceptable. No obvious defects
have developed since project completion.
4.23      Supervision by the highway authorities concerned assisted by the
design institutes was satisfactory.



- A.7 -
F.   Loan Covenants
4.24      One major loan covenant (5.01) obliged the Borrower to enter
into subsidiary loan agreements with the Subsidiary Borrower for the
purpose of relending loan funds.
4.25      Because highway administration had been decentralized in 1967
and the responsibility for public roads transferred from the Federal Govern-
ment to the Republics and Autonomous Provinces, there was no central highways
agency to exercise supervising and coordinating functions for the project.
Rather than have the Bank enter into four separate loan agreements with
the individual Republics and Autonomous Provinces concerned, which would
have entailed a detailed appraisal of each, the Yugoslav Investment Bank
again agreed to act as the Borrower's representative and as coordinator in
matters relating to project execution. Government then entered into sub-
sidiary loan agreements with each concerned Republic and Autonomous Province.
This procedure, used successfully in the execution of the Third Project, was
effective for the Fourth Project.
4.26      In order that the optimum use be made by the roads to be built
under the project as soon as possible after their completion, Government
agreed to include in each subsidiary agreement the requirement that other
roads providing access to the project roads should be constructed and/or
improved and maintained as reasonably required.
4.27      The requirements of this covenant were met satisfactorily although
in the case of Serbia, construction of the 6 km section of the Belgrade-Novi
sad highway was delayed because of problems in the intersection design at
the Belgrade terminus and difficulties in acquiring the right-of-way and
there were also delays in constructing a new access from the Belgrade-Zagreb
road. Although not completed by the loan closing date, work on the 6 km
highway section was then well advanced, but the new access from the Belgrade-
Zagreb Road will not be opened until mid-1977. The operation therefore of the
main highway has been adversely affected because of this access difficulty,
and full benefits of the construction will be not be realized until this
junction has been completed, diverting more traffic from the old road.
4.28      The subsidiary loan agreement with the Autonomous Province of
Vojvodina contained an obligation concerning the level of tolls which the
PLovince might wish to levy on traffic using the project road. It was
agreed that if they were to be imposed, tolls would be applied flexibly
and at such levels as not to divert an unduly large portion of through
traffic to the alternative toll free facilities or means of transportation.
To date no tolls have been levied and there are no indications that the
authorities intend levying tolls.
4.29      The subsidiary agreement with the Autonomous Province of Kosovo
obliged the Province to build a two-lane highway between Zaimovo and Komoran
on the project road to agreed design standards and to be completed - 'Later
than the project road. This requirement was satisfactorily met.



- A.8 -
V. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
5.01      The Bank has been heavily involved in institutional develop-
ment in Government agencies dealing with transport. A principal issue was
the fundamental change in highway administration which occurred in 1967.
As part of a larger national effort to decentralize economic decision
making, most of the responsibilities of the Federal Government in the
highway subsector (and in the transport sector generally) devolved to the
Republics and Autonomous Provinces whose authority was thereby increased.
Unfortunately, having a larger number of decision makers, as a result of
this decentralization, has increased the problems of coordination. However,
the Bank has attempted to address this problem by promoting the establish-
ment of:
(i)  the Council of Republican and Provincial Roads Organization
(CRO);
(ii) Lhe Federal Committee for Transport and Communications; and
(iii)  the Secretariats or Committees for Transport in the Republics
and Provinces.
5.02      The CRO, established by the Road Funds, Councils and Enterprises
in 1971, has been active in the standardization of engineering design
criteria, data collection and other technical matters between the Republics
and Autonomous Provinces. It has also been instrumental in the preparation
of uniform guidelines for feasibility studies.
5.03      The Bank also played a useful role in promoting coordination in
highway planning, project preparation, research and administration. Under
the Third and Fourth Highway Loans, the Federal Government and the Republics
ahd Provinces agreed to:
(i) revise existing laws and regulations, in particular to
ensure that earmarked funds will be used for highway
maintenance;
(ii) improve coordination in the highway sector; and
(iii)  collect and analyze data for highway planning purposes.
5.04      The authorities have made considerable progress in implementing
these undertakings. For example, all laws and decrees related to the highway
sector have been reviewed as part of a national review of all existing
legislation; the standard and organization of highway maintenance improved
considerably; traffic counting, which had been rudimentary in the past,
is now being carried out on a more systematic and planned basis: the Federal
Government has issued the first uniform guidelines for estimating vehicle
operating costs; and notable progress has also been made in improving project
preparation. Much of the progress in these fields has becn due mainly to the
Bank's efforts and active involvement.



- A.9 -
5.05      Further improvements are still needed, and the Government has
yet to define its transport policies more precisely and delineate clearly
the responsibilities of the Federal, Republican and Provincial Governments
in the transport sector. At present, the CRO does not have the legal status
or authority to play a fully effective role in overall highway planning and
coordination between the Republics and Provinces. Further, to promote
transport coordination, the need is becoming increasingly urgent for studies
on road user charges and on railway costs, with a view to eliminating the
overt, hidden and cross-subsidies in and between these modes. The studies
of road user charges and rail costs have been included as an important
component of the proposed Eighth Highway Project. Both these studies are
expected to assist in the optimum utilization of the existing assets, and
lay a sound foundation for formulating transport policies relating to
rail/road coordination. The Bank has maintained a close dialogue with the
Yugoslav authorities concerning the institutional problems and the goal of
achieving improved transport coordination continues to guide Bank lending
for future highway projects.
VI. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A.   General
6.01      The main objective of the project was to reduce the cost of trans-
port and relieve congestion on four main highway sections: Bar-Ulcinj,
Belgrade-Novisad, Nis-Pristina-Pec and Sarajevo-Zenica by replacing or
improving the existing inadequate road sections. The first two lanes (first
stage) of four-lane divided highways in Sarajevo-Zenica and Belgrade-Novisad
are the two principal components of the project and together they account for
about 75% of the total construction costs.
B.   Traffic
6.02      The average daily traffic volumes on the project road sections as
estimated at appraisal and from actual counts and latest estimates are shown
in Annex 3.
Saralevo-Zenica Section
6.03      Average actual traffic (1975) on the Sarajevo-Zenica section in
S.R. Bosnia-Herzegovina compared favorably with the appraisal estimate.
Belgrade-Novisad Section
6.04      In the case of Belgrade-Novisad route the average daily traffic
on the northern half and southern half of the sections varied significantly.
This was mainly because of the rapid development of commerce anl ind-stry
between Indjija and Belgrade. This traffic trend is likely to con inue and



- A.10 -
may become more pronounced with the completion of the new additional access
road to Novisad from the project road near Indjija. At present only a
portion of this new access road is ready. But it appears that in due course
this new access road will be the main connection between the project express-
way and Novisad and will form part of the European network roads (E5). This
is likely to result in substantial shortfall of anticipated traffic in the
future on the project section between Indjija and Novisad in S.A.P. Vojvodina.
Bar-Ulcinj Section
6.05      On the Bar-Ulcinj section in Montenegro, the average actual traffic
is about 20% higher than the anticipated volume mainly due to the favorable
development of tourist traffic on the Adriatic highway along the coast.
Nis-Pristina-Pec Sections
6.06      The actual traffic on Nis-Pristina and Pristina-Pec sections is
lower than "he estimated volumes by about 63% and 70% respectively. Apparently,
the apprai6al assessment of the prospect for growth of traffic on Nis-Pristina
section int Kosovo was somewhat optimistic. Reduction of traffic on Pristina-
Pec section (from 650 in 1969 to 524 in 1975) indicates the margin of uncer-
tainity of the origin-destination data provided during appraisal.
C.   Economic Benefits/Costs
6.07      The principal benefits derived from the project are savings in
vehicle operating costs. Vehicle operating costs by road section are shown
in Annex 4, as estimated at appraisal and as revised on the basis of updated
operating cost, information available for the year 1974-75. The figures show
that average vehicle operating costs, and therefore savings, have increased
by about 105% from 1970 to 1974 and by another 15% from 1974 to 1975. This
ipcrease is partly due to inflation and pErtly to the marked producer price
increases in petroleum products. The economic costs of construction of the
project roads have generally increased by about 15% to 35% as compared to
appraisal estimates. In the ex-post economic justification, actual project
costs and estimated benefits in current prices of each year have been adjusted
to eliminate the likely effect of inflation.
D.   Economic Return
6.08      The rates of return of the project road sections are shown in
Annex 5, as estimated at appraisal and as revised on the basis of updated
traffic and vehicle operating cost information.   The Annex shows that the
revised economic return (ER), excluding benefits due to savings of passenger
time, is varying between 12% and 22% for different road sections. If the
benefits due to savings of passenger time are included, the ER increases by
about 2% in all cases, confirming that on the whole, the different sub-
projects are economically justified.



- A.11 -
6.09      In spite of considerable reduction in traffic level on the
Pristina-Pec and Pristina-Nis sections, the sub-projects remain economically
viable mainly on account of increased operational cost savings at current
prices (1974-75) and substantial distance reduction (about 78 km) for through
traffic in the case of Pristina-Pec section. The revised ERs for these
sections are, however, lower and stand at about 2/3 of the appraisal estimates.
6.10      A careful scrutiny further reveals that due to likely diversion of
traffic from the Novisad-Indjija section discussed earlier, the economic
return for the northern half (from Novisad to Indjija) of the Novisad-
Belgrade highway section is as low as 6%. The extra large benefits (about
24%) of the southern half from Indjija-Belgrade is really hiding the insuf-
ficient benefits of the northern stretch. In retrospect, a simple two-lane
construction of Novisad-Indjija section (including the major bridge over
the Danube) instead of a staged two-lane construction might have been a
better proposition.
VII. THE ROLE OF IBRD
7.01      In preparation and appraisal of the project the Bank was instru-
mental in ensuring the participation of the Yugoslav Investment Bank as
project coordinator and the channel of funds to the four Republics and
Provinces participating in the project. Further, to ensure that the
realization of full project benefits would not be frustrated or needlessly
deferred, the Bank insisted the Borrowers should also build or improve
the additional roads needed to give access to the project roads.
7.02      The project did encounter unforeseen difficulties such as un-
expectedly adverse soil conditions on some sections of the Bar-Ulcinj road,
unexpected land expropriation and relocation problems through a highly
industrialized region in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and complex urban intersection
designs at Belgrade. In these situations, the Bank staff maintained a frank
and close relationship with the staff of the Borrower and provided technical
assistance and advice to minimize the adverse effect on the project.
7.03      The Bank played a particularly useful role in stressing the
need to revise the price escalation clause in highway construction contracts.
The clause then in force did not cater adequately for all the main types of
cost increases, and as prices rose sharply from about 1970, compensation
under the ,clause was less than adequate, and created a financial squeeze on
the construction industry. At Bank's suggestion the authorities agreed to
include a revised clause in all the Bank-financed contracts.
7.04      The Bank's insistence on coordination has been the most important
factor in the establishment of a consultative mechanism for the various
Republican and Provincial Road Funds in the form of tha Council of Road
Organizations. Noticeable attention was given by this body to i7)roving
the collection and analysis of country-wide traffic statistics and better
project preparation.



- A.12 -
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The project has been successfully completed and with one minor
exception all within the loan closing date. Most of the overruns in project
costs can be explained by the devaluation of the Dinar in January 1971 by
20% and by price escalation.
8.027     The main benefits from the newly constructed roads are savings
in transport costs. The E.R.s of the project roads, excluding benefits due
to savings of passenger time, range between 12% and 22%. If the benefits
due to passenger time savings are included, the E.R.s increase by about
2% in all cases, confirming that on the whole, the different sub-projects
are economically justified.
8.03      However, when the new access road to Novisad from Indjija is
finished (there is no firm date yet) there will be a substantial diversion
to it of anticipated traffic from the northern half of the project Novisad-
Belgrade ection.    The E.R. for the northern half might fall to as low as
6%. This project road has been designed and built as the first stage (two-
lane carriageway) of a limited access four-lane highway. There is now
little prospect and justification of the construction of the second carriage-
way. in view of the investment already made to provide for a future second
carriageway, the question of an entirely new alignment to Novisad from the
project road is one that should have been discussed very much earlier with the
Bank so that the optimal least total cost solution could have been mutually
agreed.
