MEMORANDUM AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
FOR A TRANSPORT AND URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau for SDR 14.0. million, the equivalent of
US$22.0 million, on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a project for
transport and urban infrastructure.
2.    Country/Sector Background. Situated on the West African coast, Guinea-Bissau is a
small country both in terms of land mass with 36,125km2, which includes some 30 islands forming
the Bijagos archipelago, and in terms of population, with an estimated one million inhabitants. It is
one of the poorest countries in the world with a per capita income of roughly US$220 (1992
dollars). Politically and economically speaking, Guinea-Bissau is in the midst of a radical
transition. After 20 years of single party rule, Guinea-Bissau came under the rule of a
democratically elected government in the fall of 1994, for the first time since independence in 1974,
but the political and social situation remains fragile. On the economic side, progress towards
building a market-based economy has shown promise, although much remains to be done to
dismantle a well entrenched command economy. After false starts in the mid-1980s, the
Government launched a far-reaching macro-economic reform program in 1987, supported by two
IDA structural adjustment credits (SACs: Cr. 1798-GUB/A-26-GUB approved in 1987, and Cr.
2019-GUB approved in 1989). Since 1992, the Government has shown renewed commitment to
adjustment which continued into the first half of 1994, allowing the release of the much delayed
third tranche of SAC III in July 1993, and the preparation of a third Policy Framework Paper
(PFP) for 1994-97. The PFP formed the basis for a three-year ESAF (Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility) arrangement, approved in January 1995 with the IMF. Adjustment has
resulted in some improvements, but domestic resource mobilization, public resource management
and public enterprise reform require special attention.
INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR ISSUES AND CONSTRAINTS
3.    Issues. The infrastructure sector has suffered from a poorly defined development policy
lacking clearly established objectives, responsibilities and resource mobilization. The institutional
framework inherited from the past is complex and fragile. Policy formulation and project
management need strengthening.  Different government departments tend to plan and make
decisions with little consultation among themselves and without refering to a central policy. This is
most evident in the areas of public works, transport and communications, which play a major role
in infrastructure. Until recently these areas were managed by two different ministries which were
recently merged. Although this merger will improve coordination, the new Ministry of Social
Equipment (MES) still needs to further restructure its departments, better define responsibilities
and improve capacity, as skilled personnel are scarce in the public sector. Under the on-going
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2074-GUB), some progress has been made in developing
a broad sector policy and project implementation through the provision of technical assistance, but
sector management capacity remains weak. In the past, the tendency has been to allocate scarce



2
resources to new capital investment and to neglect routine maintenance, particularly road
infrastructure.
4.     Constraints. Guinea-Bissau's private sector has the capacity to execute a range of public
works between US$20,000to $500,000 equivalent per contract. Besides 25 contracting firms in
the formal sector, about 100 tradesmen in the infonnal sector execute small contracts or act as
subcontractors for formal enterprises. Only the largest three to five entrepreneurs have access to
the public works market, while the situation is more difficult for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). First, they are affected by the cumbersome administration of bid presentation
and security requirements. Second, they are handicapped by technical deficiencies such as work
site planning, invoicing and stock and cash flow management. These deficiencies are compounded
by Government's cumbersome administrative procedures: it takes about a year to enter into a
contract from the time the procurement process is initiated to contract signature. Problems are
exacerbated by extensive payment delays to enterprises.
Transport Sector
5.    Issues.  Agriculture is the backbone of the country's economy.  Since undertaking
structural adjustment, policy reforms have been enacted to establish a more favorable incentive
framework in the agriculture sector. In particular, inappropriate pricing and marketing policies
have been removed. While the sector has responded well to the new incentive framework, the
medium-and long-term performance will depend on the reliability and cost of economic
infrastructure, particularly road and river transport. While the potential for competitive production
of cashews, fruits, vegetables, rice, and timber exists, the current state of the road network, its lack
of maintenance, and unreliable maritime and river transportation do not allow the supply-side gains
to materialize, especially in the southern part of the country. Vehicle operating costs are
excessively high; however, better road conditions would reduce them by 40% to 45%. Moreover,
the heavy rainy season has a considerable impact on the country's geographic integration and
transportation costs which fluctuate between US$0.11 and US$0.23 per t/km. Road network
improvements, including feeder roads, along with timely river transport services, are critical to
increasing the competitiveness of exports as well as import substitutes.
6.     Constraints include insufficient and poorly maintained infrastructure and institutional
bottlenecks. At present only 20% of the required funding is being allocated to periodic and routine
road maintenance. This contributes not only to increasing inaccessibility to different parts of the
country, particularly the south, but also leads to increased vehicle operating costs. Given the
Government's limited capacity to maintain infrastructure, there is an urgent need to increase
revenues from users, and to involve local SMEs to carry out routine maintenance and repair
existing infrastructure.
7.     A number of institutional bottlenecks also exist. Government continues to be involved in
commercial activities and companies which could be better handled by the private sector. Road
haulage is entirely run by private companies since the transport parastatal firm, RODOFLUVIAL,
could not continue loss-making in this activity. The rehabilitation of ferry services is under way
with the financing of a European Union program. However, present publicly operated ferry
services (comprising six major river crossing points) are inefficient in delivering quality services
and maintaining their equipment.  Similarly, maritime and river transportation run by



3
RODOFLUVIAL cannot play its potentially significant role due to infrequent, unsafe and poorly
managed services. Since the publicly run company, JAPG, was dissolved, Bissau harbor has been
rented out for 25 years to a private company, GUIPORT; while the harbor moved from anon-
operational situation to a reasonable degree of efficiency, it could be more efficient if charges on
containers and merchandise were adjusted to better reflect the market prices.
8.     Low domestic resource mobilization, particularly from  road users, imposes severe
constraints on government spending, making more efficient allocation to priority needs all the more
essential. Chronic underfunding of infrastructure maintenance is further aggravated by insufficient
cost recovery practices. The Road Fund, set up to finance road maintenance through user
contributions has administrative capability, but road user charges actually collected represent only
30% of potential revenues of about $600,000. This is essentially due to low rates of user charges
(for example, private gasoline-powered cars pay $9 a year and diesel powered trucks $22 a year),
and low coverage of charges. On the administrative side, the Road Fund needs to be strengthened
so that it is a separate legal entity governed by specific legal provisions, managed by a board
required to publish regular reports.
Urban Sector
9.     Issues.  A combination of rapid urban population growth (4.3%  per year) and the
persistent lack of maintenance of most infrastructure has resulted in a further deterioration of living
conditions in urban centers. Today, in spite of the ongoing efforts supported by donors, 60% to
70% of urban residents do not have access to minimal sanitation infrastructure. This results in
endemic diseases and cholera outbreaks which affect productivity and constitute 90% of demand
on the health care system. The erosion of basic urban infrastructure has further exacerbated the
plight of the most vulnerable. Government has been unable to cope with the demand and to
develop sustainable solutions to reverse the continued deterioration of living conditions in urban
areas, particularly in Bissau. The existing health infrastructure is not only poorly maintained but
also insufficient to meet the growing demand. The under five mortality rate is about 40% higher
than the SSA average. In parallel, the central government is unable financially to meet these needs.
Thus the capacity of municipalities, neighborhood and user associations to collect user charges is
critical to securing minimum funding and ensuring community participation in the maintenance of
existing urban infrastructure.
10.     Constraints. In urban areas, water supply, urban drainage, and sanitation do not meet
the country's growing needs. Bissau is supplied by nine tubewells which draw from a deep water
table, with an estimated potential output of 15,000 m3 per day. This would be sufficient, however,
the output is limited by the total storage capacity of 2,000 m3 which is far from adequate. The
distribution network consists in large part of small-diameter asbestos cement pipes, which are
obsolete, and cause losses of the order of 50%. The water distribution network is not correctly
structured and in some areas the water pressure is inadequate. Streets and sidewalks in Bissau are
routinely subjected to flooding during the rains, because storm drains need replacing or regular
dredging. Outside Bissau, there is little basic infrastructure and the lack of any institution to
manage the water supply must be resolved prior to initiate major projects in the area of water
distribution. Community facilities like schools, basic health centers, markets, slaughter-houses and
small parks require urgent rehabilitation and maintenance to arrest rapid deterioration.



4
11.    Project Objectives. The long-term development objectives are to assist the Government
in formulating and implementing its sector development program for the period 1996-2000 which
aims: (a) to enhance the efficiency of country-wide transport, particularly for the movement of
agricultural products; (b) to improve living conditions in urban areas; (c) to generate employment;
and (d) to improve the labor skills and competitiveness of local construction, road maintenance and
transport enterprises. The project objectives are: (a) to improve the management of public sector
resources devoted to economic and urban social infrastructure; (b) to rehabilitate transport and
urban infrastructure; and (c) to efficiently execute works by private small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) by delegating contract management.
12.   Project Description. To achieve these objectives, the project would support the financing
of a sector-specific policy framework and three investment programs. The policy agenda is
designed: (a) to increase sector resource mobilization and efficiency of resource use; (b) to further
strengthen the institutional environment and disengage the Government from public enterprises in
the transport sector; (c) to improve the management of road rehabilitation and maintenance; (d) to
promote the use of the private sector; and (e) to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of the
contracting of works. The project finances a time-slice of three investment programs. First, a
transport infrastructure rehabilitation program (US$14.7 million or 49% of total base costs)
which consists of: (a) a rehabilitation and maintenance program to consolidate the priority network
of roads, by providing for: (i) rehabilitation of about 150 km of roads; (ii) periodic maintenance of
about 90 km of roads; nd (iii) regular maintenance of the priority network (about 1,042 km out of
the 3,436 km network); and (b) improvement of two ports, by providing for the rehabilitation of
the maritime port of Bubaque in the archipelago and at the tidal estuary port of Cacheu including
quays and berthing structures and low cost storage facilities. Second, an urban infrastructure
rehabilitation program  (US$10.5 million or 35%  of total base costs) which includes
water/sanitation, street paving and drainage and small social infrastructure. The project will
provide: (a) in Bissau for: (i) rehabilitation of the primary network of the water distribution
system; (ii) rehabilitation and construction of critical earth and concrete drainage; and (iii)
implementation of a pilot solid waste collection and disposal program; and (b) in Bissau and seven
secondary market towns (Bafata, Bissora, Buba, Canchungo, Catio, Farim, Gabu) for: (i) street
improvements, paving and drainage; and (ii) rehabilitation and construction of small economic and
social infrastructure, such as primary schools, basic health centers, neighborhood markets,
slaughter houses and small terminals for inter-city transport. Third, a capacity building program
(US$4.1 million or 13% of total base costs) aims at: (a) strengthening capacity in policy-making,
sector management, planning and regulation through: (i) local in-service training sessions and
short-term training abroad in "Highway Design Maintenance" for MES staff; (ii) consulting
services; (iii) studies and preparation of a future sector investment projects; (iv) remodeling of
existing facilities in the MES complex; and (v) purchase of office equipment including computers,
supplies and vehicles for the three departments of MES; (b) strengthening the capacity of
contractors, engineers and architects having won contracts through the project; and (c) increasing
community participation.
13.    The use of an AGETIP-type contract management agency will address the lack of
competition in construction, inefficient procurement and payment delays, and will create
employment in urban areas through labor-intensive techniques. The remaining 3% of base costs
comes from the refinancing of two PPF (Project Preparation Facility) advances, representing $0.9
million. Schedule A presents the project costs and financing plan. Schedule B shows the project's
procurement and disbursement arrangements. Schedule C includes the key processing steps, and



5
Schedule D shows the status of Bank Group Operations, the summary of IFC investments, and a
note on portfolio implementation issues for Guinea-Bissau.
14.   Project Implementation. The sector-specific reforms in the first component would be
implemented by MES, and monitored by the Ministry of Planning and Cooperation. MES will be
responsible for reorganizing the transport and urban sectors, and overseeing the privatization of
transport enterprises. All other elements will be managed by an AGETIP-type executing agency.
Implementation arrangements would be similar to AGETIP-type agencies and make extensive use
of delegated contract management. The new agency will enter into an agreement with national and
local governments to execute the proposed operation and local subprojects.  To facilitate
implementation, a PPF has been provided: (a) to establish the agency which would manage and
contract out construction to SMEs; (b) to provide focused training for contractors and
professionals of the construction industry executing subprojects to improve management, work
organization, and technical skills; and (c) to finance short-term consultant services to increase
community participation through information campaigns and technical guidance to prepare
feasibility studies and technical project proposals to be submitted to the agency for funding.
15.   Project Sustainability. The project would have a sustainable effect because: (i) it will
help strengthen the sectoral administration; (ii) it will also contribute to improved planning and cost
recovery of investment and maintenance of transport and urban infrastructure by improving
resource mobilization and budgeting; and (iii) it will help promote and strengthen small- and
medium-sized construction firms, local consultants and contractors, thus enabling them to respond
to future demand for their services. Experience in other AGETIP-type operations also shows that
the contract management agency is self-sustained after the termination of IDA financing by
offering its services to other projects and by receiving financing from other sources.
16.   Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement. Five lessons may be drawn from
IDA's previous experiences: (a) focus on a limited number of strategic objectives; (b) continue
institutional reforms particularly in the development of public/private partnerships, and build local
capacity to promote sustained sector development; (c) rely less on ambitious cofinancing targets
which do not materialize and lead to project restructuring or the reallocation of funds to complete
components; (d) ensure that actions to provide expected domestic financing are taken so that
sufficient and timely counterpart funds are made available; and (e) streamline procurement,
contracting and payment procedures which impede the participation of local SMEs.
17.    Rationale for IDA Involvement. A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Guinea-Bissau
was presented to the Board together with the Social Sectors Project (Cr. 2465-GUB) in February
1993. The thrust of the strategy is to support policies and expenditure patterns that promote
efficient and sustainable growth, while improving the provision of social services. The strategy
focuses on: (i) sound public sector management, particularly in public expenditure management
and resource mobilization, public enterprise reform and institution building; (ii) privatization, to
remove distortions to private sector development, along with financial sector reform, and more
efficient provision of infrastructure services; (iii) poverty reduction and human resource
development; and (iv) environmental protection. The proposed operation is the immediate next step
in implementing this strategy. In addition, IDA's broad experience in designing and implementing
AGETIP-type projects makes its participation in the proposed project critical to its success.



6
18.   Agreed Actions. The following actions have already been taken by the Government: (a)
the Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) and the Ministry of Transport and Communication (MTC)
were merged into MES; (b) a letter was sent to IDA confirming its acceptance to set up an
AGETIP-type agency; (c) the recruitment of the AGEOPPE's Administrator was launched.
Before negotiations, the Government provided: (a) the signed letter of sector development
policy; (b) the decree creating AGEOPPE; the appointment of AGEOPPE's Administrator; and
draft Statutes, Manual of Procedures and Subsidiary Agreement; and (c) enacted legislation
(Investment Code and General Policy for externally financed projects in Guinea-Bissau) which
permits AGEOPPE, as a non-profit organization, to have tax exempt status, and permits
subprojects implemented by AGEOPPE to be exempt from any direct or indirect taxes and duties.
During negotiations, the Govenmment agreed that it will: (a) implement the contents of the
letter of sector development policy including the action plan contained therein; (b) terminate
RODOFLUVIAL's road haulage activities not later than December 31, 1995, through the sale of
equipment; (c) adopt not later than December 31, 1996, an action plan with a time-table,
satisfactory to IDA, describing, inter alia, the modalities of privatization of the ferry services and
the maritime operations of RODOFLUVIAL respectively, and the fare and subsidy policies of the
Government in both activities, and thereafter promptly implement such plan; (d) carry out a study
to include an action plan on the future privization or liquidation of TAGB not later than March 31,
1996 and implement such action plan not later than June 30, 1996; (e) on the basis of the
recommendations of the study on the Road Fund administration: (i) adopt, not later than one year
after credit effectiveness a time-bound action plan, satisfactory to IDA, and describing, inter alia,
actions and measures to promote the participation of road users in the management of the Road
Fund; and (ii) thereafter promptly implement such action plan; (f) properly support and manage
the Road Fund by: (i) taking all measures required to increase the annual revenues of the Road
Fund from the current level in pesos equivalent to: $555,000 in FY 1996, $580,000 in FY 1997,
$595,000 in FY 1998 and $600,000 in FY 1999), (ii) ensuring that the proceeds of the Road Fund
shall be used primarily to defray the cost of road maintenance work programs acceptable to IDA;
(iii) having the Road Fund accounts and records for each FY audited in accordance with
appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; (iv)
by March 31 of each year submitting the audit report to IDA for review and comment; and (v) by
the end of each calendar year, submitting to IDA for review and comments a report on the
collection and use of the Road Fund revenues; and (g) submit for approval the portfolio of selected
sub-projects, in annual batches no later than June 30 of each year.
As conditions of credit effectiveness, the Government will have, in a manner satisfactory
to IDA: (a) issued legislation ordering the liquidation of SILO DIATA and appointing the
members of the liquidation commission responsible to oversee the liquidation of SILO DIATA; (b)
dismantled the MES units carrying out road maintenance under force account by offering their
equipment for sale or lease and redeploying their staff; (c) adopted regulations to adjust the rates of
charges to be collected by the Road Fund from the road users during the first year of project
implementation; (d) agreed with IDA on the AGEOPPE's portfolio of subprojects for the first year;
(e) AGEOPPE has selected consultants (with TORs and selection process satisfactory to IDA) to
carry out a study on Road Fund administration not later than six months after credit effectiveness
to ensure Road Fund's autonomy, transparency and management; (f) AGEOPPE has selected
consultants and adopt a program for implementation, during the first project year of: (i) short-term



7
workshops on business administration, financial management, work organization and labor-
intensive techniques, geared towards contractors, architects and engineers; (ii) strengthening of the
capacity of the municipalities, neighborhood and user associations to carry out feasibility studies,
submit technical project proposals and secure minimum funding or participation for the
maintenance of urban infrastructure; (g) deposited a first tranche of US$190,000 corresponding to
the counterparts fund for the first six months of the project in an account opened in a commercial
bank; (h) signed the subsidiary agreement with AGEOPPE's Administrator, acceptable to IDA,
and employed AGEOPPE's staff (technical, administrative and financial directors); and (i) signed a
multi-year contract with auditors acceptable to IDA and furnished certification established by said
auditors that AGEOPPE's accounting system is operational.
19.   Poverty Category. The project is in the program of targeted interventions. Its poverty
reduction measures include: (i) increased farmers incomes by improving access to agricultural
areas; (ii) an emphasis on labor-intensive construction practices, in order to generate employment
(6,000 man-years financed under the project); and (iii) training for local small construction firms to
build their capacity to submit bids and better manage their business. The project will also have a
beneficial impact on the most disadvantaged populations by improving urban living conditions of
the most vulnerable groups, and developing municipalities' responsibility in maintaining basic
social infrastructure. The project will include beneficiary assessment studies at the mid-term
review.
20.    Environmental Aspects. The environmental category is B for this project, which involves
exclusively small scale, mostly rehabilitation works. Most of the eligible subprojects will have a
net positive impact on the environment (on-site and off-site building and/or repairing drainage
systems, soil and water conservation, and solid waste collection). To ensure that the sub-projects'
possible impact on the environment has been assessed ex-ante, evaluation criteria are included in
the Procedures Manual. Environmental analyses of each subproject will be conducted prior to its
authorization, as has been done in other AGETIP-type operations in West Africa. Environmental
impact for subprojects will be reviewed by an IDA environmental specialist in annual batches prior
to any adoption of the portfolio for the next project year. The road maintenance and rehabilitation
works will have little impact on the environment. The present road alignments will be maintained,
hence there is no risk of deforestation, property disturbance, or resettlement. Technical audits will
be conducted on environmental impact of garbage collection and disposal.
21.    Program Objective Categories. The project will contribute to economic, urban and social
infrastructure rehabilitation (particularly: road, sewage and drainage system, schools, health
centers and market place, refuse collection and disposal), to the improvement of public services
provided to the most disadvantaged populations of Bissau and seven priority market towns, and to
the creation of employment opportunities and the generation of additional income to low skilled
manpower in poor urban neighborhoods.  This will be done through small-scale urban
infrastructure, carried out by means of labor-intensive technologies, and contracted out to the
private sector (small and medium-sized contractors).
22.    Participatory Approach. A local project preparation group, spearheaded by the former
Ministry of Public Works and by the newly created MES, was set up and was assisted by two IDA
missions in 1994, one in early 1995 and one during the appraisal mission. The project was
discussed with the Prime Minister and presented by the MES in a workshop opened to the media,



8
to the ministries of Natural Resources/Energy/Industry, Education, Finance, Planning and
Cooperation, the Municipality of Bissau and private sector stakeholders represented by the
Chamber of Commerce,the Transporters' Association and civic and religious leaders. Agreement
was reached on the project objectives, scope, institutional reforms and implementation
arrangements. Overall the workshop was very well received by all.
23.     Project Benefits. The project will have direct social, health-related, economic, fiscal and
participatory benefits. Social benefits include job creation for unskilled workers through the use of
labor-intensive techniques; 20% to 30% of the value of the works contracts will go toward wages
resulting in at least 6,000 person-years of employment. Health-related benefits include improved
health and sanitary conditions resulting from the provision of potable water and improved drainage
in poor neighborhoods. Economic benefits include lower transport costs through the reduction of
vehicle operating costs by 40% to 45%; improved access to agricultural areas, which, following
project completion, will no longer be cut off during the rainy season; economic retums (with an
average of 38%) from priority infrastructure rehabilitation operations; and increased private sector
participation in infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance. Fiscal benefits include improved
sector resource mobilization and efficiency, thus enhancing the sustainability of future investments.
Finally the participation of municipalities, communities and the private sector would be a major
change for Guinea-Bissau since it will ensure ownership and thus greater sustainability of
investments.
24.   Project Risks. There are three main risks.  Regarding counterpart funding, the new
Government may encounter difficulties making its payments. To address this risk, the Govemment
decided to use the Road Fund resources for the provision of counterpart fund. To assist the
Govermment, a study on the Road Fund's administration will be undertaken and a plan of action
will be established to ensure the Road Fund's independence, autonomy and management. On the
political and institutional side, the risk is the politically sensitive reform measures, in particular for
the privatization of public companies, and reluctance of ministries, agencies, and local
govemments to delegate the management of works contracting to AGEOPPE. This has been the
case with other projects with a policy framework and with other AGETIP-type projects at the start.
Five features of the proposed project seek to address this risk: (i) most of the more difficult
reforms will be completed or initiated prior to Credit effectiveness; (ii) the proposed project
emphasizes improving living conditions of the most vulnerable and focuses on employment creation
through labor-intensive works, hence it will be politically helpful to Govenmment in carrying out
diffcult policy reforms; (iii) a presentation of AGEOPPE was made in public and was well received
by key decision-makers; and (iv) a pilot works program will also be implemented before project
effectiveness to demonstrate the efficiency of contracting and payments. Cofinancing is expected
to be confirmed before credit effectiveness. Strong interest has been demonstrated by donors such
as The Netherlands, Switzerland and Japan.  However, to address this issue, the project
components have been sliced to allow for the water sub-component to be implemented once
cofinancing is made available. Furthermore, the phased, time-slice approach to small works would
allow IDA's contribution to be front loaded. The experience in other AGETIP-type operations has
been that many donors enthusiastically buy in after the initial demonstration phase.

25.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

NOTE ON PORTFOLIO IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
1.     Overall portfolio performance is satisfactory and is expected to improve further during FY95. At
the end of FY94, key issues which adversely affected overall project implementation included: non-
compliance with legal covenants (Energy project); and policy issues (Economic Management, Energy
projects)--these led to the overall decrease in disbursements (US$10.96 million in FY94 compared to
US$15.4 million in FY93). IDA did not commit any new funds during the fiscal year 1994.
2.     As of March 31, 1995, IDA's portfolio in Guinea Bissau represented a total commitment of about
US$59 million with an undisbursed balance of US$32.17 million. Agricultural Services credit closed
during the first quarter of FY95, and SAC II also closed on December 31, 1994, leaving the portfolio (as
of March 31, 1995) with five projects (Education, Infrastructure Rehabilitation, Energy, Economic
Management, and Social Sector). Although closed in December 1994, SAC II still has an undisbursed
balance of US$1.3 million which is included in the total undisbursed amount. The November 94
supervision mission assisted the Government in collecting relevant documents for completing
disbursements under this credit (SAC II).
3.     Out of five credits in the portfolio, two (Economic Management and Energy) have encountered
policy and/or implementation difficulties. The projects' characteristics as well as actions taken to address
the issues are summarized below:
Economic Management Project/TA (Cr. 2342-GW). Disbursement: 41% (about US$2.96
million). The credit became effective on October 20, 1992. To date, only about US$2.96 million
out of US$7.2 million has been disbursed. Disbursement delays were due primarily to policy
difficulties. A mid-term review of the project took place early March 1995. The Government
and IDA agreed on a detailed work program and a realistic implementation schedule which will
strengthen the project's implementation progress.
Enerv Proiect (Cr. 2237-GW). Disbursement: 10% (about US$1.55 million). The credit
became effective on April 17, 1992; and so far, only about US$1.55 million has been disbursed
out of a total credit of US$15.15 million. Delays in disbursements were due mainly to policy
issues. This project which received a less-than satisfactory performance rating at the end of
FY94, was reviewed in April 1994, and an Action Plan to restructure the project was agreed upon
with Government authorities. The pace of the restructuring, however, fell victim to the political
elections which were held shortly thereafter. The Government has been notified, in a letter
addressed to the Minister of Finance on December 1, 1994, of the danger and implications of
allowing the project to deteriorate further A supervision mission is planned for late May 1995 at
which time the progress on fulfilling the conditions for restructuring the project will be reviewed.
4.     Among actions taken to ensure smooth implementation of projects in the portfolio is the
Government's efforts in securing donor support to provide counterpart funds needed for the Social Sector
Project.
5.     There are no outstanding audit reports for the portfolio. Procurement issues are well managed,
with procurement seminars held in Bissau routinely as part of a project launch and are attended by Project
Implementation Units staff as well as other government officials involved in project management.
