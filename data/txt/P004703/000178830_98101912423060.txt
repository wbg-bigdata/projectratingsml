I. THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The principal indigenous sources of energy in Thailand are hydro-
power, limited petroleum and lignite, large but as yet uneconomic oil shale
deposits, wood fuel, charcoal, paddy husk and bagasse. Hydro potential
(excluding that of two international rivers, the ,Mekong and the Salween) is
estimated al about 9,900 MW/I of which about 910 MW are now in operation;
410 rlW are ttnder construction; 680 MW can be installed in the future by
simply adding more units; and 1,600 MW are in the prefeasibility or feas-
ibility stu(ly stage. The economic feasibility of the remainder (6,300 W)
is not yet known. Thailand's proven petroleum reserves total about 1. million
barrels in the Fang province of Northern Thailand.  Production at prcsent is
about 100,000 barrels a year, less than 0.2% of total domestic petroleum
consumption The total lignite reserves in Thailand were estimated uit about
235 million tons of which about 110-130 million tons are proven reserves;
production was about 520,000 tons in FY77. EGAT has plans to utilizet the
known reserves for power generation by adding two units of 150 MW at the Mae
Moh thermal plant.  A recent estimate made by the Bank's mission for a lignite
mining project indicated that proven, probable and inferred reserves might be
as high as ti50 million tons in total. There are extensive oil shale reserves
(about 2,700 million tons) mainly in the remote areas of Tak province but oil
production from shale is still uneconomic.
1.02      Two natural gas deposits were discovered in the Gulf of Thailand;
the first byr Union Oil about 560 km south of Bangkok; the second by T'exas
Pacific aboutt 175 km southwest of Union Oil's discovery. Preliminary estimates
of reserves in the two gas fields amount to about 140 billion cubic rieters.
The Bank has made a loan (S-l0-TH) to the Natural Gas Organization ol Thailand
for the first phase of development of Thailand's natural gas potential by
financing the foreign exchange cost of the project management, engineering
services, and other related studies required prior to construction of the
pipeline which would carry the natural gas to the proposed Bang Pakonig power
station, situated about 60 km southeast of Bangkok, and also to the Bangkok
area by 1983. An energy master plan study is being undertaken by the National
Energy Administration (NEA) financed by UNDP with the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) as the executing agency.  The plan will cover a period of 22 years,
1979-2000.
1.03      Total energy consumption in the FY60-77 period increased f0rom
about 1.35 rmillion tons of oil equivalent (14.6 trillion kcal) to 11,1 mil-
lion tons (1.19.6 trillion kcal), an average annual growth rate of 13,'.
GNP increased by 7.3% p.a. during the same period.
1.04      Energy ronsumption by types in FY77 is shown below:
/1 Average energy output is estimated at about 15,300 GWh.

Role of the Sector in the Econopy
1.05      Electricity revenue accounts f3r only about 1.2% of GDP.  Htowever,
electricity provides motive power to the manufacturing and mining industries
which account for 16.6% and 1.9% of GDP respectively.
1.06      The growth of the power sector has kept pace with Thailand's
economic development. Between FY75 and 77, when GDP grew at an averEge rate
of about 7.3% in real terms, total electricity consumption grew at an average
rate of about 14.6%. The elasticity coeEficient of 2.0 is reasonable and
comparable to countries at a similar stage of development.
Sector Organization
General
1.07      The power sector consisted of three state enterprises and 12 private
franchises at end-FY77. The state agencies are the Electricity Genevating
Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropolitan Electricity Autlhority (MEA)
and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). Highlights of ECAT, MEA and
PEA operations are shown in Annex 1.
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
1.08      ECAT, which is responsible to che Prime Minister's office, was
established in 1968 as a wholly-owned Goiernment Corporation for the purpose
of increasing the efficiency of electricLty supply throughout the country and
coordinating the generation and transmis3ion systems.  EGAT generatec about
94% of all electric energy in Thailand ii FY77; the balance was generated by
PEA, NEA, private franchises and self-geierating industries.
The Metropolitan Electriciy Authority
1.09      MFA was established in 1958 as a wholly-owned Government Corporation
responsible to the Ministry of Interior aith the responsibility for supplying
electricity to the Bangkok Metropolitan area covering the provinces of



- 3 -
Bangkok, Thon Buri, Nonthaburi and Samut Prakon. In FY77, 6,054 GWh were
sold to 580,000 consumers. All of MEA's power is purchased from EGAT.
The Provincial Electricity Authority
1.10      PEA was established in September 1960 as a wholly owned Government
Corporation under the Ministry of Interior with the responsibility for
providing and distributing electricity in all provinces of the country except
in the areas served by MEA. PEA purchases most of its energy in bulk from
EGAT but also generates electricity in areas not yet connected to the grid.
In FY77, PEA generated 98 GWh; 3,174 GWh were sold to 1,144,000 consumers.
Private Franchises
1.11      The 12 private franchises had an installed capacity of 1.9 MW in
diesel plant at end-1977 and generated 6.3 GWh for that year. About ,'
franchise holders purchase their power needs in bulk from PEA, one directly
from EGAT, and the remainder generate their own requirements. Following the
fuel crisis and Government's policy of restricting tariff increases, most of
the self-generating franchises asked to bi taken over by PEA. The takeover
is scheduled to be completed in the near Future (41 franchises have been
taken over by PEA since FY76).
Government Agencies
1.12      In addition to EGAT, MEA, PEA arid the Ministries to which ths
utilities repDrt, several Government agencies also have a direct interast in
the power sector.  These are:
- Budge: Bureau;
- Tariff- Rate Committee (TRC);
-  National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB);
- Ministry of Finance (MOF);
-  Natioral Energy Administration (NEQ);
*             -  Rural Electrification Board (REB); and
-  Committee for Power Policy and Development (CPPD).
These agencies review:  tariff recommendat>ons, capital project proposals and
budgets for submission to the Council of Ministers; annual financial perf'orm-
ance; and Government equity and loans.. NorLe of them has overall policy
responsibility, decisions on the sector being arrived at after all the igencies
including the state utilities reach a consensus. The system is designed to
ensure that sector capital expenditures are rigidly controlled, but the
fiscal emphasis of the approval process has constrained sector development.

Sector Constraints
Sector Coordination
1.13      The Bank recommended in 1976 in the sector report (Report No.
1794-TH) that coordination among the utilities and RTG ministries should be
improved. In 1977, the Committee on Power Policy and Development (CPPD) at
cabinet level was formed for overseeing t:he functioning and development of
the power sector and it was expected to provide the required overall sector
control. However, indications over the past year are that CPPD has n)t
developed into a continuing operating entity to coordinate planning activities,
review the u:ilities' development programs and projects, review the adequacy
of tariffs and allocate funds among EGAT, MEA and PEA by adjusting MEA and
PEA's power purchase price from EGAT for this purpose. Currently six other
ministries and Government agencies besides CPPD, EGAT, MEA and PEA hale a say
in sector decision making. Although a Bill for the establishment of ia Ministry
of Science, Energy and Technology has been approved by the Cabinet, the only
agency that will report to it is NEA and it is uncertain whether the three
power entities will do so. During negotiations, Government representatives
stated tthere was a need to study the issue and it was agreed that by December 31,
1979 Government would submit to the Bank a proposal for a study to improve
power sector coordination for its review and comment. It was also agreed that
further discussion on the sector coordination issue would take place within
the context of the ongoing Power Sector Loan appraisal.
Tariff levels
1.14      The issue of appropriate tariffs for the sector is under review in
the tariff study financed under Loan 1485-TH. This study is aimed at
simplifying Fresent tariffs, ensuring that tariffs reflect cost structures,
and determining appropriate tariff levels to ensure the financial viability
of the sector and its independence from Government support.
1.15      Following the proposals of the 1976 Power Sector review (Report No.
1794-TH), fuel taxes have been reinstated. After the December 1978 OPEC
price increase, RTG has increased the pri,e of all petroleum products except
for those sold to EGAT. Fuel, diesel and lubricating oils purchased by ECAT
are being cross-subsidized within the pet:-oleum sector from surpluses made on
sales of gasoline, fuiel and other petroleum products to the general public.
Other aspects of the tax question, particularly whether the sector should
cease to be exempt from corporation tax or its equivalent, is being investi-
gated by the ongoing tariff study.
Load Forecast
1.16      The coordination and agreement of EGAT's, MEA's and PEA's load
forecasts remain a continuing problem. During appraisal of the proposed
project, it was concluded that load forecasts for all three utilities were
somewhat underestimated, and adjustments were made accordingly. An in-depth
study of load forecasts by a committee made up of the utilities, NESDB, and
NEA has confirmed the acceptability of the load forecast. Their prediction is
within 1% of the appraisal forecast (para. 3.04).



-5-
Bank Participation in the Sector
1.17      The Bank has made eight  Loans to EGAT and its predecessor totaling
$282 million to help finance power plants and transmission facilities and one
loan to PEA of US$25 million to finance the Accelerated Rural Electrification
Project.  The first six projects of EGAT have been completed and are all opera-
ting satisfactorily. The Seventh Power Project (Ban Chao Nen Hydroelectric
Project) was on schedule at mid-1978.  The project is expected to be completed
in March 1980 as scheduled. The Eighth Power Project (Pattani Hydroelectric
Project) and the Accelerated Rural Electrification Project are still in early
stages of implementation.
1.18      The last power project performance audit report made in March 1978 for
the South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project (Loan 790-TH) indicated that the
main objectives of the project had been met. The project was completed on
time and within the original cost estimate. EGAT's financial perfornance was
satisfactory during the FY71-76 period, although the operating ratio, rate of
return and contribution to construction were below the appraisal estimate as
a result of the higher operating, maintenance, administration and fuel costs
after the oil crisis.
Power Market and Supply /1
1.19      In 1977, total sector generating capacity installed by the various
entities was as follows:
ownership                       Installed capacity (MW)
EGAT                                    2,742.3
PEA & NEA                                  88.0
Private franchises                          1.9
Self-generating industries                255.9
Total                            3,088.1
Of this total, 910.0 MW were hydro (29.5,'); 1,808.9 1MW (58.5%) steam;
204.2 MW (6.6%) diesel; and 165 MW (5.4%) gas turbine.
1.20      Total energy generation in 197~ was 11,690.8 GWh of which
11,168.8 GWh were generated by state enterprises/2, 6.3 GWl by the private
franchises and 515.7 Gwh by self-generating facilities.  Hydro plants produced
3,264.8 GW-Th; steam plants 8,053.3 GWh; diesel units 271.0 GWh; and gas
turbines 101.7 GWh.

1.21      Total energy consumption was 9,968.2 GWh in 1977 or 225 kWl per
capita: 2,005.9 GWh (20.1%) were used by residential consuners; 1,469.3 GWh
(14.7%) by commercial consumers; 6,377.6 GWh (64.0%) by industrial consumers
and 115.4 GWh (1.2%) by street lighting and others.
Access to Electricity
1.22      Regional imbalances still exist; per capita consumption and the

Rural Electrification
1.24      Provision of power to the provincial areas began on a planned basis
only in 1960 with the formation of PEA. Growth in these areas has been rapid,
at an annual average growth rate of 12.5% in the number of consumers and about
24.0%, on average, in kWh sold since FY68.  However, rapid as the growth has
been, the degree of electrification in PEA's area increased only from 9.5% to
20.0% between FY68 and FY77, due to the relatively high population increase,
the fact that PEA had to concentrate its efforts initially on connecting
urban and semi-urban areas to the grid, and PEA's commercial orientation of
not giving connection without a 100% contribution for industrial and commercial
consumers and a 30% contribution for village consumers. The annual rate of
village connections rose from 940 in 1974 to 1,440, 2,250 and 2,372 for 1975,
1976 and 1977 respectively.



1.25      Government recognized that village electrification was proceeding
too slowly to meet the needs of villagers. To distribute resources more equi-
tably, PEA was directed in 1973 to plan an Accelerated Rural Electrification
Program and give priority to the more backward areas. In accordance with
this directive, PEA plans to electrify about 19,000 villages from 1977
through 1983.

2. THE BORROWER
2.01      The Borrower would be EGAT, established in 1968 by a merger of three
generation and transmission authorities. It is a financially sound, well
organized and operated utility under the control of competent management.
The General Manager is currently also Thailand's Minister of Industry.  EGAT
and its predecessors have received a total of US$282 million in eight loanis
from the Bank since 1957. Loan proceeds have helped finance the explansion of
the main generation and transmission system in Thailand. Although the proposed
loan will assist in financing the ninth Bank project in partnership with
EGAT, the grid has not yet reached all areas of Thailand; growth of demand is
accelerating; and the rural electrification program is increasing the need
for generation and transmission facilities. Continuing Bank assistance
is therefore required.
Organization
2.02      EGAT is organized and functions as a modern public utility with a
considerable degree of auitonomy and is charged with the operation of the
power generation and transmission installations under its jurisdiction and
the establishment of such new facilities as may be required for the Thai
power grid down to transmission voltages of 115 kV and 69 kV. It does not
have responsibility for isolated diesel or mini-hydro generation or for
transmission and distribution below 69 kV.
2.03      The Board of Directors consists of a Chairman and not more than ten
other members, including the General Manager. All Board members act in a
part time capacity, with the exception of the General Manager, and they are
appointed by the Council of Ministers.
Management, Manpower and Training
2.04      Management and staff are able and well qualified.  EGAT had a total
of 15,526 employees at end-FY77: 1,628 were graduates of universities, 1,780
had diplomas and higher professional education, and 2,752 higher vocational
training. EGAT has adequate resources to recruit staff to meet its Long-term
requirements. It will use consultants, if necessary, for studies or other
engineering services (see Annex 2, the C'rganization Chart).
2.05      Training is handled by the Authority's Training and Development
Division which arranges seminars, together with external and internal courses
for EGAT employees ranging from management seminars for middle management to
technical training.
Accounting and Audit
2.06      Accounting is based on the US Federal Power Commission's s-stem.
The system has been computerized 'in-house' and it is well operated and
administered by a well qualified and competent staff.



- 9 -
2.07      The audit is performed by the National Audit Council, the Government
organization responsible for auditing all state enterprises.  Since the early
'sixties the international accounting firm, Coopers and Lybrand of London,
has been retained as financial consultants to cooperate with the Audit Council
in the annual audit and issue a separate report on the annual accounts each
year. EGAT is satisfied with this arrangement and it was agreed during
negotiations that EGAT will continue to use financial consultants.
Tariffs
2.08      EGAT's tariffs are the standard two part type that charges separately
for demand (SW) and energy (kWh); they are appropriate for a supplier of bulk
power.
2.09      Rising costs of sector operation and the need to support PEA for
the rural electrification program brought about a tariff increase averaging
29% in August 1977.  Although the new tariff levels did not fully restore the
sector's financial position to pre-1973 levels, the increase was accepted
with the understanding that tariff levels would be addressed again to provide
for another increase in average levels for the beginning of FY80. Thailand
suffered a drought during FY77 and 78 and also had problems in obtaining
sufficient supplies of fuel oil. I'he situation led to much higher than
forecast generation of kWh from fuel fired thermal stations rather than from
hydro stations as forecast during the appraisal of the Pattani Project (Loan
1485-TH).  A rate of return of 3.2% has been achieved for FY78 and self-
generation of 16.3% of construction expenditures earned compared to a
covenanted 15%. During negotiations the Thai Authorities agreed to increase
average tariffs to achieve a 7% rate of return on revalued net fixed assets
both for EGAT and the sector as a whole. The increase is expected to be
approximately 30%. Implementation of a tariff increase sufficient to earn 7%
for FY80 is incorporated in the draft loan agreement as a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan.
2.10      Under Loan 1485-TH, Government and EGAT agreed to carry out a study
of the structure of tariffs of the whole power sector. The report arising
from the study was expected to be ready in mid-1978 but is now to be completed
by mid-1979 as the power development program was revised based on the new load
forecast (see para. 3.04).
Present Facilities
2.11       EGAT had a total of 2,742 MW in service at the end of 1977 made up
of-
Type of Plant           MW                 %
Hydro                    909            33.2

2,742           100.0



- 10 -
2.12       Power is transmitted at three voltage levels; 230 kV, 115 kV and
69 kV with a total line length of 8,938 circuit-kilometers at end-1977. Ninety-
five substations were in operation with an installed capacity of 3,988 MVA.
EGAT's grid is modern and efficient. Annex 3 gives additional details
and the map attached shows the location of generating plants and transmission
lines.
2.13      During FY77, EGAT had problems obtaining adequate supplies of fuel
oil because its private supplier provided only the maximum quantity stipulated
in the fuel contract. Problems have recently arisen again because of the
reduction in available oil supplies due to the situation in Iran. EGAT is
currently short of fuel oil and is expected to continue to have difficulty in
obtaining adequate supplies until the world supply is restored to adequate
levels.

3. THE POWER MARKET
History
3.01      EGAT's market covers all of Thailand and comprises the Greater
Metropolitan area of Bangkok served by MEA; the provinc:ial areas served by
PEA; and bulk supplies to industries and other large scale or specialized
consumers that it has been directed to supply by Royal D)ecree, including
Electricite du Laos (EDL). EGAT's sales in FY77 were as follows:
Annual
Peak demand       Energy sales       load faciLor
(MW)             (GWh)                (x)

Total           1,817.2  100.0%  10,149.6   100.0%          63.8
3.02      The power market has hadl a long history of steady growth, the
average anntual increase in peak and energy demands being 14.5% and 15.6%
respectively over the period FY70--77. Early stimulants were rapidly rising
investments, favorable world rice markets, and an expanding economy. As a
result of the oil crisis and world. economic recession, the low point was
reached in FY74 when peak and energy requirements increased by only 4.8% and
5.6% respectively. However, system growth has recovered rapidly since FY75.
Peak and energy growth are shown below:

Load Forecast
3.03       EGAT's load forecast is based on the consolidation of forecasts
made by MEA, PEA and the direct consumers after taking into account the
effects of load diversity, system losses and station consumption. MEA bases
its forecast on the assumption that its service area would be fully electri-
fied by 1981, and PEA bases its forecast on the assumption that its service
area would be fully electrified within 25 years.
3.04       EGAT's previous load forecast was made in December 1977 after the
tariff adjustment of August 1977. This load forecast was on the low side,
based on the judgement that the rising electricity costs would slow down the
growth of power requirements. However, the actual growth of energy generation
in FY78 wEas higher than the original estimate. A new load forecast was
therefore made at the time of appraisal and confirmed recently by an in-depth
study by a committee (para. 1.16). It took into consideration the FY78
loads, the newly added industrial developments by market survey and the
accelerated rural electrification projects - ARE II, III, and IV. The
revised load forecast is shown below:
Fiscal    Energy Generation        Annual       Peak Generation
year       GWh    % increase  load factor    MW      Increase
1978     12,493.0    14.1           66.7       2,138.0    14.1
(Actual)
1979     14,065.0    12.6           66.2       2,425.0    13.4
1980     15,781.0    12.2           65.8       2,738.0    12.9
1981      18,475.0    17.1          65.3       3,232.0    18.0
1982     20,627.0    11.6           65.7       3,581.0    10.8
1983     22,601.0       9.6         65.2       3,960.0    10.6
1984     24,604.0       8.9         64.9       4,329.0      9.3
1985     26,696.0       8.5         64.7       4,710.0      8.8
1986     29,365.0    10.0           64.6       5,189.0    10.2
1987     31,752.0       8.1         64.5       5,617.0      8.3
1988     34,211.0       7.7         64.3       6,072.0      8.1
1989     36,828.0       7.6         64.1       6,562.0      8.1
3.05       The revised forecast indicates that EGAT's peak and energy generation
would increase from 2,138 MW and 12,493 GWh in FY78 to 6,562 MW and 36,828
GWh in FY89. The average annual growth rates would be 14.6% and 14.0%
respectively for FY78-81, 9.9%, and 9.7% for FY82-85, and 8.7% and 8.4% for
FY86-89.



- 13 -
3.06      This load forecast from FY86-89 may still be conservative as it
levels off rather rapidly. Since EGAT reviews and revises its load forecast
each year and the program after 1986 is still flexible enough to cope with
any reasonable change in load requirements, this forecast is considered to be
an acceptable basis at this stage for formulating the power development
program and making the financial projections.
S wyply
3.07      To meet the increasing generation requirements, EGAT's system
has to be expanded continuously. The system load requirement and the
capability available to meet the demand is given in Annex 4 and shown
graphically in Annex 5. The FY79-85 energy and capacity balances are
summarized below:

of hydro plants is defined as the annual energy output that would lbe
available 95% of the time.



- 14 -
3.08      The reserve capacity is based on the criterion that the system will
maintain supply to consumers with the largest unit out of service, equivalent
to a loss-of-load probability of about 3 days a year in the past. EGAT has
been able to maintain this criterion because annual scheduled maintenance of
large thermal units can be carried out when system peaking capability is
ample and because it has hydro plants with large reservoirs which can be
drawn down in the event of the forced outage of large thermal units.  It has
been decided, however, that with more large thermal units being added to the
system, a modification in the reliability criteria would be necessary.
Therefore EGAT has planned that after FY85 reserve requirements would be
based on the largest and the third largest units being out of service simul-
taneously. This will be reviewed by a loss-of-load probability analysis in
the long-term study for future generation and transmission projects (para. 4.03).

4. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
4.01       EGAT's power development program is based on the least cost sequence
of development following an extensive study of the alternative generation and
transmission projects using the computer programs available in-house.  However,
EGAT considers that the program may require further optimization by consultants
(see para. 4.03).
Generation
4.02       EGAl"s generation program has been planned to meet the projected
demands with adequate reserve margins to maintain operational flexibility
under minimum river-flow conditions and forced outage of the largest unit(s)
in the system. The generation program, FY78 through 85, includes on-going
works totalling 620 MW, and new projects of 2,980 MW capacity, as follows:

4.03      The justification of the Lang Suan Hydroelectric Project is still
pending the outcome of a study of alternatives comprising a 230 KV trans-
mission line from the Central Region and a base-load thermal power plant in
the South. The program from FY86 onwards is not yet definite and is the
subject of further studies. EGAT approached the Federal Republic of Germany
in late 1977 for technical assistance for a study of generation and transmis-
sion projects to determine the optimal sequence of development in detail up
to 1990. The plan would include also a review of the load forecast, comparison
of thermal alternatives including lignite-fired thermal units and nuclear
power units, a review of reserve margin and reliability criteria, arid formu-
lation of a comprehensive development program for a period of 20 yeears.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that a long-term study for
generation and transmission projects will be undertaken no later than January
1, 1980.
Transmission
4.04      EGAT's transmission system expansion program involves the construc-
tion of transmission lines and substations associated with generation projects
and the extension of the network to cope with the increasing load requirements
and to improve system reliability and efficiency.
4.05      The transmission program, FY78-85, is summarized below:

4.06      Further, in order to extend the system to the remote areas to
support PEA's provincial and rural electrification projects, 2,456 km of
115 kV lines will be built in addition to the projects listed above.
Program Investment
4.07      The cost of the program including interest during construction but
excluding government contributions towards downstream benefits for multi-
purpose projects is estimated at about B 111.5 billion through the period
FY78-86, of which B 63.5 billion will be foreign costs and B 48.0 billion local
costs.
4.08      The relative allocation of costs for generation and transmission
is indicated below:

Project Description
4.09      The project will be the first unit of the Bang Pakong thermal power
plant located at the mouth of the Bang Pakong river about 60 km southeast of
Bangkok.  The project comprises:
(a)  site development which will ultimately cater to four units each
of 500 MW capacity;
(b)  construction of civil works including power plant structures and
buildings, fuel supply handling and storage systems; cooling water
system, make-up water, etc.;
(c)  supply and installation of the boiler, turbo-generator and auxiliary
electrical, and miscellaneous mechanical equipment for the first unit;
(d)  construction of the 230 kV Bang Pakong switchyard, Rangsit and Bang
Kapi substations and 110 km of 230 kV double circuit transmission
line to augment the existing 230 kV line from Siracha to Bang Kapi;
(e)  engineering services; and
(f)  a study of future generation and transmission projects.



- 19 -
4.10       The unit size proposed would be 500 MW, which is the result of a
least cost study in which the proposed unit was compared with 2 units of
300 MW (para. 6.06). Upon completion of the project in FY83, this unit size
would be about 12.5% of the system's maximum demand of 3,960 MW. At the
South Bangkok thermal plant, EGAT already has 2 units of 200 MW and 3 units
of 300 MW in operation. There will be 3 hydro plants backed by large reser-
voirs (6 x 70 MW, 3 x 125 MW and 3 x 120 MW) in commission by 1980. A system
stability analysis has been made by EGAT for various conditions of contin-
gencies. Following the loss of the 500 MW unit, an automatic load shedding
program by relay protection would be necessary so as to maintain system
frequency at an acceptable level and to give time for the reserve capacities
to come ini:o service.
4.11       'The boiler would be designed to operate at a steam pressure of 2,400
0       0
psi and a l:emperature of 1,005 F/1,005 F reheat.  The boiler would be dual
fired to enable it to use either natural gas or oil. This would help develop
the market for natural gas in the initial years of operation of the gas
fields.

contingencies of about 15% for civil works, 5% for plant equipment and trans-
mission facilities have been included. The price contingencies for foreign
and local costE; were calculated on the basis of assumed annual rates of
escalation of t% for 1978, 7.5% for 1979 and 7% thereafter for civil works;
and 7% for 1978, 6.5% for 1979 and 6% thereafter for plant equipment anc
transmission facilities./l Detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 6.

Project Financing
4.13      The proposed Bank loan of US$80.0 million is equivalent to 27% of
the project cost, excluding interest during construction. This would cover
the foreign exchange cost of the turbo-generator package, auxiliary electrical
mechanical and miscellaneous equipment and part of the engineering services.
4.14      The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KCFAED) is expected
to agree to provide EGAT US$22.0 million equivalent for the financing of the
foreign exchange cost of part of the boiler plant package and the transmission
lines and substations.
4.15      A cDmmercial bank loan of about US$19.0 million would be required
to finance the foreign exchange cost of construction equipment, civil works
and engineerinig and consultant services. The boiler plant: package would be
partly financed by suppliers' credits. Based on experience with projects now
under construction (Mae Moh Unit No. 3 and gas turbines), EGAT would have no
difficulty in financing major equipment from suppliers' credits, should more
attractive financing not be available.
4.16      The proposed financing arrangements would therefore be as follows:

Procurement
4.17      All materials and equipment financed under the proposed Bank loan
would be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines with the Bank's usual
preference of 15% (or custom duties, if less) being granted to local manufac-
turers. In the case of minor items of equipment not exceeding US$150,000
equivalent each and not exceeding, in the aggregate, the equivalent of
US$2,000,000, contracts may be awarded: (i) either following local com-
petitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank and EGAT; (ii) following
prudent shopping involving at least three price quotations; or (iii) on the
basis of negotiated contracts of less than US$150,000 subject to the Bank's
prior written approval to the final award of each contract.
Disbursement
4.18      Disbursements for the auxiliary electrical and mechanical equipment
for the power plant would be made against 100% of the foreign exchange cost of
directly imported equipment and materials; 100% of ex-factory cost of equipment
and materials manufactured locally; and 65% of total expenditures for equipment
and materials procured locally off-the-shelf. Disbursements on the turbo-gene-
rator plant package would be 100% of the foreign exchange cost. For the
engineering services financed by the Bank, disbursements would be 50% of the
foreign exchange cost or other arrangements acceptable to the Bank in cofinan-
cing with the commercial banks. Disbursements are expected to be completed by
June 30, 1984. The estimated semi-annual disbursement schedule is given in
Annex 7. No disbursements would be made for expenditures made prior to the
signing of the proposed loan.
Engineering Services
4.19      Black & Veatch International (BVI) of USA has been used by EGAT for
the design and construction supervision of the five units at South Bangkok
thermal plant. All units are now in satisfactory operation. EGAT has
already engaged BVI to provide engineering services for site investigation,
engineering studies, preparation of equipment specifications, tendering,
tender evaluation, detailed design and construction supervision of the
project. As BVI has performed well for the South Bangkok thermal power
project and is familiar with local conditions, this arrangement is acceptable.
The target estimate for home office services would be about 1,500 man-months
at US$5,000 per man-month and those for field supervision would be about 160
man-months at US$6,200 per man-month, including local costs; the terms of the
contract are reasonable.
Construction
4.20      Civil work construction will be carried out by contractors under
the supervision of EGAT engineering personnel assisted by BVI. Instal-
lation of equipment will be carried out by EGAT's own work force under the
supervision of the manufacturers' field engineers. This has been EGAT's
practice for all thermal plants in the past and has worked satisfactorily.
Bidders for the boiler and turbo-generator packages will be requested to
provide a training program for EGAT personnel. BVI will send qualified



- 23 -
personnel for a period of about three months during the initial start-up of
major equipment to coordinate the activities of the manufacturers' field
engineers and to assist EGAT's operating staff.
4.21      The tender documents for all the equipment incluading boiler, turbo-
generator and miscellaneous electrical and mechanical equipment were issued
in October 1978. Bids will be opened in March and contracts awarded in
June 1979. Ihe major equipment will require about 48 months for engineering
design, fabrication, shipping and erection. The unit will be synchronized
with the system in June 1983 to start initial operation and is scheduled for
commercial operation by August 1983. A construction schedule is shown in
Annex 8.
4.22      The 230 kV transmission line will be constructed by the suppliers
on a supply a:ad erect basis. Substation equipment will be installed by EGAT's
own work force. The target date for completion is December 1982.
Ecological Aspects
4.23      The project site is located at the mouth of the Bang Pakong river.
The surrounding area has a minimum of development and is relatively uninhabited.
No resettlement problems are involved. The land use is primarily agricultural.
The nearest small town, Ban Bang Pakong, is about 4 km away to the west of the
site. The prevailing wind direction is NE-SW which is favorable.
4.24      Since natural gas is basically a "clean" fuel and the normal
products of combustion are completely harmless, no impact on the environment
is anticipated from burning this fuel.  However, fuel oil will be burned in
the event of gas supply shortages, and provision will be made in the plant
design to insure that the ambient levels of sulfur and nitrogen oxides would
not exceed acceptable health limits. An air pollution study by BVI indicated
that with a stack height of 122 m (400 feet), the maximum predicted ground
level concentrations of sulfur dioxide will be below the standards of the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as indicated below:

4.25      Cooling water will be taken from the Bang Pakong river which is
about 400 m wide and 11 m deep at the site. Average river flow is about
230 cms with a current velocity of 0-1.3 m per second. The site is situated
in the tidal zone, as is the South Bangkok thermal plant. The flood and ebb
currents will assist in dissipating the rejected heat and no significant effect
is anticipated on marine life. A thermal diffusion study by mathematical
model is being made by the Asian Instittte of Technology.
Risks
4.26      ECAT is experienced in the coristruction of thermal power plants;
the consultants - BVI - are well known internationally and have long experience
in Thailand. No risks due to typhoon, Earthquake or flood are expected for
the project. One possible uncertainty is the bearing capacity of the soil
foundation. However, twenty-two holes have already been drilled and tested
indicating satisfactory results.  The subsoil conditions are very similar to
those encountered at the South Bangkok thermal plant site. Precast concrete
piles will be used. Otherwise, the project risks are no greater than would
normally be expected with other developmients of this nature.
Completion Report
4.27       In order to inform the Bank and the Borrower about the performance
of the project, and the lessons learned during its execution, a completion
report is required following the closing date of the loan. EGAT should
undertake not later than six months after the closing date, or such later date
as may be agreed for this purpose between the Borrower and the Bank, to
prepare and furnish to the Bank a report, of such scope and in such detail as
the Bank shall reasonably request, on the execution and initial operation of
the project, its cost and the benefits derived and to be derived from it, the
performance by the Borrower and the Bankc of their respective obligations under
the Loan Agreement and the accomplishmenit of the purposes of the loan.

5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Performance
5.01       The provisions of the Act: governing EGAT's activities and the
policies followed by the Board have enabled management tc, maintain a sound
financial position. Following the fuel crisis, local borrowings, remission
of fuel tax and postponement of capital expenditures maintained ECAT's sound
financial position until 1977 when the 29% increase in tariffs helped to
place the utility in a position to meet its future capital requirements.
Over the past seven years rates of return on historically valued net fixed
assets in operation have ranged from 10.1% in FY71 to 6.6% for FY77; based on
net fixed assets revalued /1 from FY70 the rates of return range from 10.1%
in FY71 to 2.3% for FY77. Revaluation of assets was only required by the
agreement of Loan 1485-TH signed in 1977. Debt service coverage on an annual
basis was greater than 1.8 times in six out of the past seven years and the
debt/equity ratio of 42/58 at end-FY77 was satisfactory.
5.02       Despite the low rates of return EGAT has met its cash generation
covenant with the Bank (para. 5.05). Even for FY77 when water availability
for generation was extremely low and co,ts increased due to higher than
estimated fuel oil based generation, EGAT contributed 24% of the average of
the FY76-78 construction expenditures f::om internal cash generation.

Future Position
5.03      Economic expansion and the additional generation and transmission
capacity required to support Thailand's rural electrification program will
cause EGAT to expand its asset base three times over the nine years ended
FY86. Expenditures to meet the required construction program are estimated
to total B 111.5 billion (US$5.5 billion) at current prices including interest
during construction. EGAT plans to borrow 56% abroad to cover foreign costs;
16% will be borrowed locally; 6% would come from Government equity; and 22%
would be self-financed, on the assumption that a 7% rate of return on revalued
net fixed assets will be earned for FY80 and FY81 and 8% thereafter. The
financing plan based on these assumptions is as follows:
Financing Plan FY 78-86
(Billions of Baht and US Dollars)
B       US$
Internal cash generation              55.9      2.8    50.1
Less: debt service and working
capital needs                 31.0      1.6    28.5
Internal funds available for

Total capital expenditure            111.5      5.5    100
5.04       EGAT has no difficulty in raising funds in foreign markets.  It
has a long standing association with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and
the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan and more recently with
KFAED. No difficulties have arisen in the past in obtaining bilateral
financing and suppliers credits. Since funds were obtained from commercial
banks last year for cofinancing the Pattani project with the Bank, EGAT has
made increasing use of Euro-dollar sources and recently signed a US$60
million loan with a bank syndicate led by Lloyds Bank of London.
5.05       In the past, EGAT's earnings covenant with the Bank has been based
on average self-generation over four years of 30% of four years average
construction expenditures; for Loan 1485-TH, a covenant for annual self-genera-
tion of 15% for FY78 and 79 and 20% thereafter of three years average construc-
tion expenditures, was agreed. The definition of self-generated funds was
also changed to be the balance remaining after covering working capital
requirements. Repeated attempts in the past to change the covenant to a rate
of return basis finally met with success.



- 27 -
5.06      During the negotiations for the Accelerated Rural Electrifi--
cation Project (Loan 1527-TH) made to PEA this year, Government agreed to a
sector rate of return of 7% for FY78-79 and 9% thereafter. The drought in
FY77 and FY78 (para. 2.09) also aff-ected FY79 due to the need to restore
hydro reservoirs to a desirable level. Consequently fuel oil generation was
high, increasing costs to greater levels than forecast.  A rate of return of
2.1% is anticipated for FY79 and in view of the current uncertainties regard-
ing fuel oil price movements, and to assist RTG in its efforts to combat
inflation, it was agreed that a 7% rate af return would be earned for FY80
and 81 for EGAT and the sector as a wholi and 8% thereafter. The 8% level is
the same as the Bank has agreed for other ASEAN countries and will provide
adequate self generation of funds to contribute to construction expeLditures
without rescrt to Government subsidies. It was therefore agreed that EGAT's
covenant be changed to a rate of return covenant reading as follows:
(a) ECAT shall from time to time take all such measures (including
without limitation seeking the Government's authorization for
adjustments of the structure or levels of its electricity tariffs)
as shall be required to produca an annual rate of return of not
lEss than 7% for FY80 and FY81 and 8% thereafter on the average
current net value of its fixed assets in service.
(b) Fcr the purposes of this sectiDn:
(i) the annual rate of return shall be calculated by dividing
EGAT's net operating incomne for the fiscal year in quEstion by
one-half of the sum of tha current net value of EGAT's fixed
assets in service at the 3eginning and the end of that fiscal
year, expressed as a percentage;
(ii)  the term "net operating income" means the gross revenues from
all sources related to EGAT's electricity operations Jess all
expenses of electricity operations, including administration,
adequate maintenance and taxes or any payments in lieu of
taxes, and provision for depreciation.  Initerest and other
charges on debt are not considered to be operating expenses
for the purposes of determining the net operating income; and
(iii)  the term "current net value of EGAT's fixed assets in service"
means the gross value of the fixed assets in service less the
amount of accumulated depreciation and consumers contributions
all valued annually from FY71 in accordance with the fixed
capital formation deflator used for public investment in the
Guarantor's annual accounts.
(c) Before April 30 in each of its fiscal years, EGAT shall on the basis
of realistic forecasts review the adequacy of its tariffs to produce
for the current and next following fiscal years such annual return and
shall furnish to the Bank a copy of such review upon its completion.



- 28 -
5.07       Surplus funds are transferred from MEA to PEA by EGAT charging PEA
a lower price for power than TIEA; and EGAT relies on both to purchase the
power it generates. The consequent interdependence of the utilities makes it
necessary that the sector as a whole earns a rate of return that will ensure
consumers are charged an economic price for power and at the same time
generates sufficient funds from internal cash generation to enable the sector
development program to continue unhindered. It was therefore agreed to
provide in the Guarantee Agreement that the sector as a whole earn a rate of
return of 7% for FY80 and FY81 and 8% thereafter, based on the definition
included in para. 5.06.
Tariff Levels
5.08      Given that EGAT earns the proposed rates of return, projected
average tariff levels per kwh /1 and the % increases required to achieve
them are as follows:
Current Prices                      Constant 1978 Prices /a

/a   Discounted at 6% p.a.
Future Operating Results
5.09      Energy sales are estimated to increase from 10,149 Gwh in FY77 to
27,576 Gwh in FY86, an average annual growth rate of 11.5%. Based on the
rates of return agreed at negotiations revenues are forecast to increase
from B 4.6 billion (US$0.23 billion) in FY77 to B 25.3 billion (US$1.2 bil-
lion) in FY86, an average annual growth rate of 27%; operating expenses
are expected to grow from B 4.3 billion (US$0.2 billion) for FY77 to B 17.2
billion (US$0.85 billion) in FY86 after escalation at 6% p.a., for all
costs except fuel, giving an average annual growth rate of 17%.
/_ Fuel price increases over the FY79 level are excluded; these would be
dealt with by the fuel surcharge provisions in EGAT's tariff schedules.



- 29 -
5.10      A downward trend in the operating ratio from 92% in FY77 to 68% in
FY86 indicates the improved financial situation over the forecast period and
that an increasing proportion of revenues is made available to help finance
construction expenditures.
Debt Control
5.11      The capital structure will remain satisfactory throughout the
forecast period; the debt equity ratio is estimated to vary between 44/56
(FY78) and 58/42 (FY81). EGAT's current debt control covenant provides for
Bank review of borrowings when the debt aquity ratio exceeds 60/40 or when
medium term debt aggregates to 15% of total debt. It was agreed to continue
these covenants for the proposed loan.
Current Position
5.12      The current ratio has varied in the past between 1.4 (FY77) and
2.0 (FY76) and is estimated at a minimum of 1.0 through FY86. Forecasts
indicate that EGAT may have a tight liquidity position in FY79, 80 and 81.
However, this entity has access, if necessary, to local short-term borrow-
ings. Consumers receivables at end FY77 were about 3.4 months billing which
is high for a bulk power supplier. However, EGAT's contracts with MEA and
PEA provide for extended payment over 60 days after the bill is received.
The supply contract cannot be amended without the agreement of MEA and PEA.
The problem will be addressed during the ongoing tariff study with a view to
having the contracts amended so that bills are outstanding for a reduced
period.
5.13      Inventory levels are less than 2% of gross plant on a historically
valued basis which is reasonable.
5.14      Income, Funds Flow Statements mnd Balance Sheets for EGAT and the
Sector are shown in Annex 10 and assumpt:ions incorporated in these
financial forecasts are shown in Annex 1L.

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Justification
6.01      A review of EGAT's power development plan, FY78 through FY90,
indicates that its planting-up program in the mid-eighties would be controlled
by energy ill some years and by peaking requirements in others. The need for
additional capacity by FY83 is demonstra,ted below:
FY83
Without the        With the
FY82           project            project
Requirements
Peak generation (MW)                 3,581.0         3,960.0              3,960.0
Energy generation (Gwh)            20,627.0         22,601.0            22,601.0
Dependable Capacity (MW)               4,050.5         4,200.5              4,700.5
Firm Capacity (MW)                     3,750.5         3,900.5              4,200.5
Surplus or Deficit (MW)                  169.5           (59.5)               240.5
Firm Energy Generation (Gwh)          20,188.5        21,243.0             22,173.7
Surplus or deficit (Gwh)              (438.5)       (1,358.0)              (427.3) /a
Average Energy_Gneration (Gwh)    21,724.3            22,907.7             23,838.7
Surplus or deficit (Gwh)             1,097.3           306.7              1,237.7
/a  This deficit is due to the fact that the calculation is made on an annual
basis.  Actually there will be no deficit in energy in FY83 after com-
missioning the project in August 1983.
6.02      As indicated above, EGAT will be able to meet its energy and
capacity requirements until FY82. However, the increase in energy requirement
in EGAT's system by FY83 would be around 2,000 Gwh a year, equivalent approxi-
mately to 270 MW in capacity at a plant factor of 0.85. This would be very
difficult to provide from hydro projects, and with the commissioning of Unit
No. 5 at the South Bangkok thermal plant, that site has been fully developed.
A new high-efficiency base-load station is therefore required to be commis-
sioned by August 1983.



- 31 -
Least Cost Solution
6.03      EGAT has a vigorous plan to utilize fully the known lignite reserves
for power generation by adding No. 4 and No. 5 units of 150 MW each at the
Mae Moh thermal plant. Any further development would require confirmation of
proven reserves by additional drilling, site investigation and other engineering
studies. This new development would not be completed by 1985/86 to be an
alternative to the Bang Pakong project. Nuclear power would not be available,
at least not before 1988/89, because of the long gestation period of about
9-10 years for the first unit. A thermal plant fired by gas and/or oil is
therefore the only alternative.
6.04      The following three alternatives were compared on a program basis:
Year    Program A                  Program B                   Program C
1983    Bang Pakong No. 1          Bang Pakong No. 1           Bang Pakong No. 1
(500 MW)                  (300 MW)                    (300 MW)
1984    Khao Laem                  Bang Pakong No. 2           Bang Pakong No. 2
(3 x 100 MW)              (300 ME)                    (300 MW)
1985               -               Khao Laem                   Gas Turbines
(3 x 100 MW)                (4 x 50 MI)
1986    Bang Pakong No. 2          Bang Pakong No. 3           Bang Pakong No. 3
(500 MW)                  (500 MW)                    (500 MW)
Program A is the base case; Program B is a realistic alternative but with
100 MW additional peaking capacity as well as energy; Program C is a hypo-
thetical case which would provide capabilities nearly identical to those for
Program A, with comparable degree of reliability.
6.05      The comparison was made on a constant price basis by comparing the
total present worth of investment, operation, maintenance and fuel costs.
The fuel costs were calculated by merit-order operation of generating plant
on a system basis. Efficiency prices were used as follows:
(a) taxes and duties were excluded;
(b) foreign exchange costs were shadow-priced by a factor of 1.1;
(c) the conversion factors for the skilled labor and unskilled labor
were assumed to be 1.0 and 0.5 respectively.



- 32 -
6.06      Program A with Bang Pakong No. 1 (500 1IW) and Khao Laem (3 x 100 MIW)
was found to be the least cost solution for discount rates up to 32% when
compariag Program A with Program B and 11.4% when compariilg Program A with
Program C./1 The total present worth of these three alternatives at
different discount rates is as follows (see Annex 12 for details):
Discount rate             Program A         Program B         Program C
(%)                  -----------------B million              …
8                    75,893            77,523              77,772
10                    62,331            63,665              62,919
12                    53,092            54,194              52,873
14                    46,460            47,375              45,718
Internal Economic Rate of Return
6.07      The internal economic rate of return of the project (IERt) is the
discount rate which equalizes the economic costs and benefits attrLbutable
to the project. The costs are net of taxes and include both the fill costs
of the associated transmission and the estimated incremental distribution
costs required to market the power to retail consumers. If the in-remental
retail revenues attributable to the project and based on the curreit average
tariff of B 0.796 per kWh are used as a minimum estimate of the beiefits, the
internal rate of return is 10.5%. This value of IERR indicates that average
retail tariff level is somewhat low relative to the incremental c03t of
project oatput. Preliminary results from the ongoing tariff study (paragraph
1.14) support this conclusion. If thE average retail price of B 0.850 per
kWh at the 1978 price level, correspording to the anticipated tari.t increase
required to allow EGAT to make an 8% return on revalued net fixed assets in
operation in FY82, is used as the basis for revenue benefits, the [ERR is
13.0%.
/1 With cost allocation for irrigation and other downstream benefits for the
Khao Laem project, the equalizing discount rate between Program A and
Program C would be 16.9%.

7.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following
points and appropriate covenants included in the loan documents:
(a) sector coordination (para. 1.13);
(b)  tariff increases (para. 2.09);
(c)  a long-term study of future generation and transmission
projects (para. 4.03);
(d)  rates of return (para. 5.06).
7.02      The implementation of a tariff' increase sufficient to earn a rate
of return of 7% for FY80 on revalued net fixed assets both for EGAT and the
sector as a whole, is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan
(para. 2.09).
7.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$80.0 to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thai:land for 20 years
including a grace period of five years.

Least Cost Analysis
Alternative Programs
1.        The least cost analysis was. made on a program basis rather than on
a project basis. The following three programs, each of which would :;atisfy
the projected demand up to 1986, were compared:
Year    Program A                   Program B                   Program C
1983    Bang Pakong No. 1          Bang Pakong No. 1            Bang Pakoing No. 1
(500 MW)                   (300 MW)                    (300 MW)
1984    Khao Laem                  Bang Pakong No. 2            Bang PakoiLg No. 2
(3 . 100 MW)               (300 MW)                    (300 MW)
1985                               Khao Laem                    Gas Turbines
(3 x 100 MW)                (4 x 50 M11)
1986    Bang Pakong No. 2          Bang Pakong No. 3            Bang Pakong No. 3
(500 MW)                   (500 MW)                    (500 MW)
2.        Program A is the base case; Program B is a realistic alternative
but with 100 MW additional peaking capacity as well as energy; Program C is
a hypothetical case which would provide capabilities nearly identica: to
those for Program A, with comparable degree of reliability (power conitribution
of Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project consists of a dependable peaking capacity
of 250 MW and an average energy output of 806 GWh, equivalent to 108 MW of
thermal capacity at a plant factor of 0.85).
Capital Cost
3.        All costs were based on mid-1978 price level.  Price continigencies
were not included. Efficiency prices were used as follows: (a) taxes and
duties were excluded; (ii) foreign exchange costs were adjusted by applying
a standard conversion factor of 0.91 (or multiplying foreign costs by 1/o.91
= 1.1); (iii) local costs were adjusted by shadow pricing: the Khao Laem
Hydroelectric Project at a factor of 0.85, made up of the unskilled labor
component of the local costs (30a) shadow-priced at 0.5 plus the 30% of the
remaining local ccosts (30% x 0.5 + 70% = 0.85); and the thermal projects at



- 54 -                           Annex 12
Page 2
a factor of 0.95, made up of the unskilled labor component of the local
costs (10% shadow-priced at 0.5 plus the 90% of the remaining local costs
(10% x 0.5 + 90% = 0.95).
4.        The capital cost estimated for various projects without shadow
pricing is as follows:
Foreign      Local       Total      Cost per kw
Project                            ---------B million -------               US$
Bang Pakong (1 x 500 MW)           3,171.5       1,555.6    4,727.1        467.0
Bang Pakong (2 x 300 MW)           4,216.7       2,282.9    6,499.6        535.0
Khao Laem Hydro                     3,391.5      2,379.0    5,770.5        950.0
Gas turbines                          856.5        126.4       982.9       243.0
5.        The transmission lines and substations associated with various
projects were included. No cost allocation was assumed for the Khao Laem
Hydrelectric Project for downstream benefits. Only a nominal amount of flood
control benefits were included./l
Operation and Maintenance (O/M) Cost
6.        The estimated costs of 0 & M For Bang Pakong thermal unit(s), Khao
Laem Hydroelectric Project, gas turbines and the related thermal units
involved in the analysis are given below:
Power P'lant                    Fixed Cost            Variable Cost

7.        The 0 & M transmission system is based on:
- 0 & M of transmission line = 1% of total line cost..
-  0 & M of substation = 2% of total substation cost.
Fuel Cost
8.        The fuel consumption of alternlative programs was calculated by an
energy balance study on system basis, t<aking into consideration the fol'lowing
factors:
(a)  reservoir operation and status of reservoir levels at various dams;
(b)  maximum generation or energy capability of various thermal plants;
(c)  scheduling of energy generation according to merit order; and
(d)  constraint on minimum generatJ.on.
9.        Fuel costs used in the analys:.s before shadow pricing are as follows:
Fuel cost (w/o tax)_
Average                                      I)istillate
Heat Rate         Heavy oil   Natural Gas         oil

South Bangkok                   2,472             1.5774         36.9
North Bangkok                   2,630             1.5875           -             -
Gas turbines                    3,024                -           36.9          2.32
Results of Analysis
10.       The total present worth of three alternatives at different discount
rates is as follows:

8                    75,893             77,523              77,772
10                    62,331             63,665             62,919
12                    53,092             54,194              52,873
14                    46,460             47,375             45,718
11.       Between Program A and Progran. B, Program A is the least cost
solution for all discount rate up to 32%. The equalizing discount rate
betwen Program A and C is 11.4%. This is because no cost allocation was
made to the Khao Laem multipurpose project and no increase of fuel price in
real terms was assumed.
Sensitivity Test
12.       Sensitivity tests between Prcgram A and Program C for variations in
capital costs and fuel cost were made, with the results shown below:
Case I                 Case 2
All Khao Laem costs    With costs allocation
allocatrd to power       to downstream benefits
(a)  On basic assumptions                11.4%                     16.9%
(b)  Khao Laem project, all civil
work costs increased by
10%                                10.4%                      15.9%
15%                                 10.0%                     15.5%
20%                                  9.7%                     15.0%
(c)  Fuel cost increased by
1% p.a.                             12.2%                     17.7%
2% p.a.                             13.0%                     18.5%
3% p.I.                             13.9%                     19.4%
13.       Therefore the power development program FY83-86 including Bang
Pakong units 1 and 2 (2 x 500 MW) and Khao Laem Hydroelectric project is the
least cost solution. The later can be justified even on the basis of power
alone.
