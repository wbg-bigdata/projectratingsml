BANG PAKONG THERMAL POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1690-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Completion Report for the project financed under the
fifth loan to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and the
ninth power loan to ECAT and its predecessor. The US$80 million loan which
became effective on May 23, 1980, was provided to finnce approximately 44Z of
the foreign cost of a project comprising land procurement and site development
of a power station at Bang Pakong that will ultimately consist of four gene-
rating units, construction of civil works including power plant structures,
and supply and erection of the first generating unit, and the associated
230 kV switchyard, substations and transmission lines, and a study of future
generation and transmission projects. This report was preparad by the East
Asia and Pacific Projects Department, Energy Division. A first draft of the
report had been prepared by the Thermal Plant Construction Department of EGAT.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to SCAT, the Government and the Co-financier for comments. Comments received
from the Borrower have been reproduced as Appendix A to the report.

BANG PAKONG THERMAL POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1690-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
A loan of US$80 million was made to EGAT in May 1980 to finance part
of the foreign costs of constructing the Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project,
including the associated transmission lines and a study of future power gene-
ration and transmission projects (para. 2.06). The Bang Pakong Thermal Power
Project consisting of a 530 MW dual-fired (oil or natural gas) unit was com-
missioned about 1 month behind schedule (para. 3.10). The unit has been gene-
rating commercially since January 1984 (paras. 3.10 and 4.03). The actual
project cost (excluding interest during construction) was US$279 million
equivalent, about 6% below the appraisal estimate; the costs of the power
plant equipment were about one third lower and those of civil works about 80%
hither than the appraisal estimate for these items (para. 3.12). The study on
future power generation and transmission project, was completed in November
1981, and EGAT has drawn both on its content and methodology continuously
since (para. 3.08).
SGAT's peak generation rose from 2,255 MW in 1979 to 3,878 MW in
1985. ECAT's energy sales increased by 64% during the period (12,934 GWh in
1979 to 21,240 GWh in 1985).
The project will reduce Thailand's needs for imported fuel, and its
ex vost internal economic rate of return of 26% confirms its economic viabil-
-ty paras. 6.01 and 6.04).
EOAT continues to be well managed (para. 4.02). After operating
costs had been seriously affected by severe drought and the oil price rises of
1979, the Government implemented substantial tariff increases in 1980 and 1981
which helped to restore EGAT's financial viability (paras. 5.01-5.07).

I. INTRODUCTION
The Power Sector
1.01      Power in Thailand is supplied principally by three government enti-
ties, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropoli-
tan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial Electricity Authority
(PEA). EGAT is responsible for generation and high vot.tage transmission to
supply bulk power to MEA, PEA4 and a small number of large industrial consum-
ers. MEA is responsible for distribution in the greater Bangkok Metropolitan
area, and PEA for distribution throughout the rest of the country and for
minor generation in certain isolated areas.
1.02.          EGAT's system at the end of FY84 compares with that of FY78 as
follows:

The Borrower
1.03      The Borrower was EGAT, an autonomous entity established in 1968 by a
merger of its predecessor, the Yanhee Electricity Authority (YEA) and two
other entities. EGAT, which accounts for almost all of the electricity gene-
rated in Thailand, is a well organized and operated utility with a consider-
able degree of autonomy. Its Board of Directors consists cf a Chairman and
not mo,.e than ten other members, including the General Manager. All Board
members, who ore appointed by the Council of Ministers, act in part-time capa-
city, with the exception of the General Manager. EGAT's organizational struc-
ture was streamlined in December 1985. It now has six Deputy General Managers
responsible respectively for thermal power plant and mine development, hydro-
power and transmission system development, power plant operations, transmis-
sion system operations, accounts and finance, and administration.
1.04      This was the fifth power loan to EGAT and the ninth to EGAT and its
predecessor. The loan for the first EGAT Power Project (Loan 655-TH) was made
in Febrtary 1970 to help finan_e the power installation (3 x 125 MW) at the
Sirikit dam and the addition of Unit No. 3 (300 MW) at the South Bangkok ther-
mal power plant. The second loan to EGAT was made in November 1971 for the
South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project (Loan 790-TH). The third loan was
made in April 1974 for the first stage of the Ban Chao Nen Hydroelectric Proj-
ect (Loan 977-TH). The fourth loan was made in September 1977 for the Pattani
Hydroelectric Project (Loan 1485-TH). A sixth loan was made in September 1980
for the Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project (Loan 1770-TH).
1.05      The conclusions of the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) for
the first EGAT Power Project were that (a) the Sirikit units were implemented
a few months earlier than envisaged, with a cost overrun of 4Z; (b) the South
Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 3 had a cost overrun of 3X and was completed six
months behind schedule mainly due to the need to repair the generator; (c) the
major objectives of the project had been met; and (d) EGAT complied with all
covenants and its financial performance was satisfactory.
1.06      The conclusions of the P'AR for the South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4
Project were that (a) the major objectives of the project had been met;
(b) the project was completed on time and within the original cost estimate;
(c) EGAT's financial performance was satisfactory; and (d) some financial
advantage resulted from exercising an option to purchase duplicate generating
equipment provided in the contract for Unit No. 3.
1.07      The conclusions of the PPAR for the third project, the first stage
of the Ban Chao Nen Hydroelectric Project, were that (a) the project was exe-
cuted as planned and was completed according to the original schedule but at a
cost overrun of about 30% which was beyond the control of EGAT due to the
world fuel crisis and the resulting inflation; (b) the resettlement plan was
carried out successfully; (c) the Government succeeded in implementing tariff
increases four times; and (d) the financial position of EGAT and the sector as
a whole was sound. The major lessons to be learned from that Project were
that an International Board of Consultants (IBC), which EGAT has retained
since 1974 to advise on major hydroelectric projects, can be very effective in
ensuring adequate project design and implementation, and that an effective way
to conserve energy is through an appropriate energy pricing policy.



-3 -
1.08      The couclusions of the Project Completion Report (Report No. 5607)
for the Pattani Hydroelectric Project were that (a) the project was completed
about two months ahead of schedule and at a cost slightly below the appraisal
estimate; (b) the resettlement plan was carried out successfully; and (c) the
several substantial tariff increases implemented by Government during 1980-81
helped restore the financial viability of both EGAT and the sector as a whole
but that the financial condition of both should be kept under review as the
impact of the tariff increases gets increasingly neutralized by the rising
costs of electricity supply.
1.09      The conclusions of Project Completion Report (Report No. 6157) for
the Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project were that (a) the project was executed
essentially as planned, with due regard to ecological and environmental
factors (5) the resettlement program and the establishment of agricultural
cooperative societies were carried out successfully and (c) while civil costs
were 17X higher than estimated at appraisal, additional geological investi-
gations prior to commencing implementation of the project would not have
reduced project costs nor advanced actual commissioning, and the decision to
proceed with construction based on the available data had proved to be a
judicious one.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION AND PREPARATION
Project Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      Two natural gas deposits were discoverd in the Gulf of Thailand in
1971; the first by Union Oil about 560 km south of Bangkok and the second by
Texas Pacific about 175 km southwest of Union Oil's discovery. Preliminary
estimates of reserves in the two gas field amounted to about 4.6 trillion
cubic feet.
2.02      EGAT engaged consultants in 1977 to provide engineering services to
evaluate various sites at which natural gas could be used for power genera-
tion. The left side of the Bang Pakong River was eventually chosen. The sur-
rounding area had a minimum of development and no resettlement problems were
involved as the site was relatively uninhabited. The site had a further
advantage in that the prevailing wind is in a favorable NE-SW direction so
that when fuel oil needs to be burnt, at times of gas supply shortageap sul-
phurous deposits will generally occur only over the Gulf of Thailand.
2.03      The same consultants also provided engineering services for the pre-
paration of equipment specifications, bid evaluation, detailed design, and
construction supervision of the project.
2.04      On-site project preparation began in 1978 with soil investigations,
groundwater exploration and the construction of access roads and bridges.
2.05      A power mission which visited Thailand i't September 1977, started
project preparation by the Bank. The project was appraised during a power
mission to Thailand in August/September 1978.

Project Description
2.06      The project included the construction and installation of the first
unit of the Bang eakong thermal power plant located at the cmouth of the Bang
Pakong river about 60 km southeast of Bangkok. The project comprised:
(a)  land procurement and site development for the  nstallation of four
thermal units, each of about 500-MW capacity,-
(b)  construction of civil works including power plant st.ucture3 and
buildings, fuel supply handling and storage systems, cooling water
system, make-up water, etc.;
(c) supply and installation of the boiler, turbo-generator and auxiliary
electrical, and miscellaneous mechanical equipment for the first
unit;
(d) construction of the 230 kV Bang Pakong switchyard, Rangsit and Bang
Kapi substations, and about 110 km of 230 kV double circuit trans-
mission line to augment the existing 230 kV line from Siracha to
Bang Kapi;
(e) supply of construction equipment;
(f) engineering services; and
(g) a study of future generation and transmission projects.
Project Role in Thailand's Development Program
2.07      The project is an important part of EGAT's expansion program to meet
Thailand's rapidly growing energy and power demand for electricity, in part,
resulting from the ongoing accelerated rural electrification program, and sub-
stantial growth in the industrial sector. By being capable of using indige-
nous natural gas as fuel for power generation, the project reduces Thailand's
dependence on imported fuels for electricity generation. In addition, the
dual-fired design of the boiler allows for flexibility in the use of natural
gas as fuel, if and when need emerges for larger quantities of natural gas for
industrial and other purposes.
1/   The results of international competitive bidding were evaluated by the
Consultants, who recommended that an order be placed for the most
economic bid. As a result, EGAT purchased a unit with a rating of
550 MW.



III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01      Board approval of the project took place on April 24, 1979.  The
loan was signed on August 9, 1979, and became effective on May 23, 1980, fol-
lowing the Government's agreement, in connection with Loan 1852-TH (Mae Moh
Lignite Project) to carry out a Plan of Action to restore the financial via-
bility of EGAT and the power sector as a whole (para. 5.04).
3.02      Project preparation and procurement for the major items were well
advanced by the date of Board approval. EGAT issued bidding documents, in
accordance with International Competitive Bidding procedures, for all major
plant items. The documents were issued in October 1978 and bids were opened
on March 7, 1979. Contracts were signed on October 12, 1979, for the supply
of the electrical equipment, and on December 4, 1979, for the supply of the
turbine generator, the main power transformer and for the water treatment
works. The contract for the supply and erection of the Control and Informa-
tion System was signed on February 15, 1980.
Changes in Scope of Work
3.03      The project scope remained essentially the same as described in the
Staff Appraisal Report. In July 1979, the Bank agreed to EGAT's proposal to
utilize part of the loan, as had been envisaged at the time of appraisal sub-
ject to funds being available, for the supply and erection of an integrated
thermal plant Operations and Maintenance Training Center. The contract with
the engineering consultants was extended to cover the design and engineering
of the Center. A contract for the supply and erect.cn of the Center's Control
Room Simulator was signed on March 24, 1981. The construction of the Center
and the Simulator was completed in February 1983, about six months in advance
of the synchronization of the first generating unit.
3.04      A change in the planned source of boiler make-up water took place
during the development of the scheme. It had been assumed that permission
would be forthcoming to extract water for this purpose from an adjacent canal
which drains the Klong Luang basin. Government decided that such an extrac-
tion would be detrimental to the canal users and permission for extraction was
refused. As a result EGAT constructed the Bang Phra and Bang Bao water
extraction and supply systems, including deep wells, reservoirs and a 40 km
pipeline to Bang Pakong, to supply make-up water to the project.
Project Implementation
(a) Physical Works
3.05      Civil works in the area of the boiler began in August 1979.  Prog-
ress of the work fell behind schedule when soft and unstable subsoil condi-
tions were encountered which caused deviations and unacceptable settlement to
the driven concrete piles. These difficulties were resolved by modifying the
foundation design and adding extra concrete piles (para. 3.09). Piling for
the power plant area was completed in March 1981, and by November 1981 most of



-6 -
the structural steel had been erected. Erection of the boiler drum took place
in September 1981. Generator installation began on site in April 1982, and
was completed in December 1982. Most of the installation work was performed
by EGAT's own staff under the guidance of representatives of the equipment
suppliers.
3.06      Blowing-out for steam-pipe cleaning took place in .June 1983 and
steam was first raised using natural gas on July 23, 1983. The unit was first
synchronized to EGAT's system on August 10, 1983, two months behind the origi-
nal schedule; and performance tests were completed in January 1984, about one
month behind the appraisal targeto
3.07      Construction and installation of the 230 kV double-circuit transmis-
sion line from Siracha to Bang Kapi were carried out by turnkey contract and
were completed in January 1984. Compared to the original schedule for this
work, this constituted a delay of about 12 months which resulted largely from
the contractor's poor performance in the manufacture and delivery of towers
and his inefficient organization of the erection work on site.
(b) Study of Future Generation and Transmission Projects
3.08      As required under Section 3.06(a) of the Loan Agreement, EGAT con-
tracted consultants to carry out a study of future generation and transmission
projects together with an in-depth review of the load forecast. The consul-
tants submitted their final report on November 3, 1981. The study concluded
that EGAT's forecasts of system total requirements were well within acceptable
deviations. The study identified long-term energy policy options and analyzed
these to produce several alternative least-cost development programs based on
various scenarios of indigenous energy resource availabilities and imported
fuel costs. The sensitivity of the several alternative programs to deviations
in cost of financing, capital costs, fuel costs, load growth and generating
reserve reliability standards was ascertained. The study's conclusions indi-
cated the benefit of advancing the development of Mae Moh lignite-fired gene-
rating units and delaying the construction of coal-fired power stations. The
study also indicated that the least-cost development plan should include gas-
fired combined cycle generating units at Khanom and Bangkok. In the event
that the amount of natural gas allocated for electricity generation is
restricted due to its use for other more economically beneficial purposes, the
study recommended bringing forward the construction of coal-fired units at
Ao Phai. The study's findings were adopted for the EGAT Power Development
Plan included in the Fifth National Economic and Social Development Plan
(FY82-86)p however, macro-economic developments resulted in the need to post-
pone some of these proposals (para. 5.01). EGAT has drawn on the methodology
and content of the study report continuously during the last several years.
Risks
3.09      The Staff Appraisal Report recognized only one risk to the project
-- the uncertainty about the bearing capacity of the soil. The report men-
tioned that 22 holes had been drilled and tested indicating satisfactory
results and that the subsoil conditions were believed to be similar to those
encountered at the South Bangkok thermal plant site. Nevertheless, this



-7-
numier of test holes did not reveal the true general nature of the subsoil.
Consequently, additional concrete piling, land fill cnd extra civil works were
required for the power plant, the barge dock facility, the river front and
gantry crane, resulting in substantially higher-than-estimated costs of civil
works (para. 3.12).
Project Completion
3.lq      The construction of the first unit of the Bang Pakong power station
was completed in November 1983. Following the satisfactory conclusion of the
performance tests and the handing over to EGAT of the power plant by the main
contractors the project was essentially completed in January 1984, about one
month later than originally estimated (paras. 3.06 and 3.07).
Project Costs
3.11      The final project cost (excluding interest during construction) in
current prices was US$278.95 million equivalent, of which US$138.81 million
was the foreign exchange cost, and US$140.14 million equivalent the local
cost. The appraisal estimate and the actual cost of the project are compared

-8-
3.12      The actual project cost (excluding interest during construction) was
US$17.9 million (6%) lower than the appraisal estimate. This net underrun of
US$17.9 million resulted from an underrun of US$45.2 million in the foreign
cost and an overrun of US$27.3 million in the local cost. Most of the foreign
cost underrun relates to the power plant equipment (boiler, turbo-generator
and auxiliary equipment), the total cost of which was about 32% lower than the
appraisal estimate for these items or about 14% lower than the base cost esti-
mated at appraisal. The base cost had been estimated at mid-1978 prices based
on bidding information available for similar size power plant in the region.
However, because of keen competition among suppliers, who at the time were
particularly short of orders, very low fixed-price offers were received for
the supply of the power plant equipment.  The resulting savings in the costs
of power plant equipment were largely eroded by an increase of about 80%
(US$40.3 million) in the total costs of civil works. The increase in the
costs of civil works was essentially in the local cost, which increased by
about 1002 (US$43.4 million), and relate to the inclusion in the project of
the Operations and Maintenance Training Center and associated buildings
(US$8.6 million), the water extraction and supply systems for boiler make-up
(US$12.1 million), and the additional civil works (US$22.7 million) under-
taken as a result of poor subsoil conditions (paras. 3.03-3.05 and 3.09).

4.02      EGAT continues to be well managed.  Staff are well qualified and
competent. The working climate and staff morale are excellent. Although the
number of employees per megawatt installed has reduced over the project
period, and sales per employee have risen since 1982 the number of EGAT staff
is high. The number of employees reflects the fact that EGAT (a) carries out
most of the field investigation work required for its future projects, (b)
uses its own task force for installation of equipment in power plants and
substations, and (c) operates its mines which have been expanded rapidly in
the last few years. EGAT's training program is adequate.
Plant Commissioning and Operation
4.03      Commissioning of the power plant began in February 1983.  The gene-
rating unit successfully delivered its rated capacity of 550 MW from Septem-
ber 26 to October 13, 1983. Performance tests of the power plant and its
auxiliaries were conducted from January 17-26, 1984, and comprised six runs
performed burning fuel oil and five performed burning natural gas. The plant
was released to ECAT for commercial operation on January 26, 1984.



- 11 -
4.04      The results of the performance tests can be summarized as follows:
(a) When firing on fuel oil, the steam grnerating unit met its design
capacity, and its performance efficiency conformed to the predicted
valvs within the accuracy of test conditions and instrumentation.
The turbine-generator unit met its guaranteed heat rate. The dif-
ference between the test heat rate and the predicted value was well
within the accuracy of test conditions and instrumentation error.
The average net station incremental heat rate was 1,939 kilocalories
per kilowatt-hour between the net generation loads of 275 MW and
550 MW.
(b) When firing on natural gas, the steam generating unit met its design
capacity, and its performance efficiency exceeded the predicted
values. The turbine-generator unit met its guaranteed heat rate.
The average net station incremental heat rate was 2,101.4 kilocalo-
ries per kilowatt-hour between the net generation loads of 275 MW
and 550 MW.
4.05      Records of plant operations for the period January to December 1985
are given in Annex 3.
Environmental Monitoring
4.06      EGAT recognized early in the life of the project that burning fuel
oil in the quantities commensurate with generating 550 MW could be injurious
to the environment. Consultants were employed to carry out an air quality
study in 1978 which indicated that a stack height of 122 m would ensure that
United States Environmental Protection Agency standards of sulphur dioxide
content at ground level would not be infringed. In 1979, 1980 and 1981, the
Asian Institute of Technology conducted thermal diffusion studies of the warm
water outflow likely to occur from the Bang Pakong site. The results were
used as criteria in the design of the power plant's intake and outfall struc-
tures. Studies of the effects of the power station on the Bang Pakong river
have also been carried out by the Institute of Inland Fisheries. Resulting
from these studies, an Environmental Monitoring Program has been implemented



- 12 -
since 1983.  Indications are t t the project has had a negligible ef 5qct on
the air quality in the region,_ or on the aquatic life of the river._
Resettlement
4.07      No resettlement was involved as the site was uninhabited.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
General
5.01      Energy sales during the period FY79-84 increased at an average
annual rate of 9.0% compared with the appraisal forecast of 12.2%. As a
result of increases in electricity prices, energy conservation measures and
slower economic growth, energy sales grew only at an annual rate of 6.0X dur-
ing the three-year period FY80-82. However, with higher economic growth and
stable prices, energy sales increased 14.0% in FY83 and 10.2% in FY84.
5.02      Severe drought in 1979 affected hydro generation, forcing EGAT to
increase thermal generation, with corresponding increases in operating costs.
The situation deteriorated further as fuel prices increased by 115% in 1979
and EGAT was not permitted to implement adequate tariff increases. In FY80,
EGAT experienced operating losses for the first time. To help EGAT solve its
liquidity problems, the Government implemented several tariff increases which
helped restore EGAT's financial health (para. 5.04).
5.03      ECAT's comparative income statements, balance sheets, funds flow
statements and key financial indicators are presented in Annex 4.
Financial Covenants and Operating Results
5.04      Section 5.04 of the Loan Agreement and Section 3.02 of the Guarantee
Agreement, respectively, required that EGAT and the power sector as a whole
shall produce annual rates of return of not less than 7% in FY80 and FY81, and
not less than 8% in FY82 and fiscal years thereafter, on net revalued fixed
2/   A meteorological monitoring tower and its access have been constructed,
and observations are being carried out by EGAT's Ecology and
Environmental Division (EED).
3/   The EED have monitored the station's discharge and the results indicate a
thermal plume temperature well within the Department of Industry dis-
charge water temperature standard. The quality of river water remains
suitable for aquatic life and the amount of disolved oxygen is Al above
4 mg/l. The relatively small quantities of domestic wastewater from the
site have a biological oxygen demand of less than 20 mg/l. The results
of cage fish culture experiments, in the river adjacent to the site,
using Sea Perch (Lates Calcarifer) indicate they grow well with standard
weight and are disease free.

assets.  One of the conditions to loan effectiveness was that EGAT and the
Government take all measures, including without limitation, adjustment of Lhe
structure or level of tariffs of EGAT, MEA and PEA to ensure that EGAT and the
power sector as a whole earn the rates of return that were specified for FY80.
Towards this end, the Government tried to raise tariffs in November 1979 by as
much as 71% for EGAT and 56% at sector level, but this increase was not poli-
tically feasible. Despite these difficulties, the Government managed to
increase tariffs in February 1980 by 50% for EGAT and 38% for the power sector
partially to cover fuel cost increases. Realizing that additional efforts
were needed to restore EGAT's financial viability, a Plan of Action was agreed
at the time Loan 1852-TH (Mae Moh Lignite Project) was negotiated. Under that
plan, tariffs were to be gradually adjusted to eliminate all oil subsidies by
January 1, 1981, and EGAT and the sector were to achieve annual rates of
return of not less than 2% in FY81 and 8% in FY82 and fiscal years
thereafter. EGAT and the Government fully complied with this plan; oil subsi-
dies were eliminated, and electricity tariffs were increased in 2 steps (Octo-
ber 1980 and January 1981) by 43% at EGAT's level or 35% at sector level and
further increased in April 1981 by 20% at EGAT's level or 19% at sector
level. Consequently, in FY81 EGAT earned a rate of return of 9.2%, compared
to the 2% covenanted for that year.
5.05      While EGAT's tariffs remained unchanged in FY82, a small reduction
(4%) was implemented in April 1983 in line with the reduction in EGAT's oper-
ating costs as a result of decreases in oil prices. Beginning with FY82 EGAT
has been required to remit to the Ministry of Finance a portion of its net
income. The level of remittances to be made by EGAT is determined by the Min-
istry of Finance on a year-to-year basis. For FY82 and FY83 EGAT made remit-
tances of about 5% of its historical net income for those years. The level of
remittance for FY84 was increased to 10% of net income. Despite these remit-
tances to the Ministry of Finance and the small tariff reduction in April
1983, EGAT was able to earn in these three fiscal years rates of return in
excess of the 8% covenanted.
5.06      While the large rate increases of FY80 and FY81. had gone a long way
towards restoring the financial viability of EGAT and the sector, the impact
of those increases has begun to gradually decline since FY83 as a result of
both the April 1983 price reduction and the effect of inflation, and the rates
of return on revalued assets for FY85-86 are expected to be less than the 8%
covenanted. However, a tariff study by consultants is being carried out for
the Government. The study, which is expected to be completed in 1986, is
reviewing the financial prospects of the se,-or and is to recommend an appro-
priate structure and level of tariffs to maintain the financial viability and
self-sustaining growth of the sector.
5.07      The following outlines other financial covenants in the Loan Agree-
ment and their compliance:
(a) EGAT would review before April 30 in each of its fiscal years the
adequacy of its tariffs to meet the requirement set forth in the
revenue covenant. This covenant was modified under Loan 2000-TH
(Power Subsector Project) where EGAT is required to review quarterly
the adequacy of its tariffs. EGAT has monitored its tariffs on an
almost continuous basis;



- 14 -
(b) EGAT would maintain in its tariff schedules a provision for changes
in fuel costs. This provision has been reflected since August 1,
1977 in EGAT's, PEA's and MEA's tariff schedules but its implementa-
tion has sometimes suffered delays (paras. 5.02 and 5.n34);
(c) EGAT's long-term debt should not exceed 1.5 times its equity, and
its short- or medium-term debt should not exceed 15% of its total
debt. EGAT has complied every year with both these covenants; and
(d) EGAT would: (i) submit to the Bank by April 1 of each year its
audited financial statements and a report of such audit; and
(ii) continue to employ qualified and experienced financial consul-
tants. The financial reporting requirements have been met and EGAT
continues to employ Coopers and Lybrand as financial consultants.
VI. PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
Project Achievements
6.01      The Bang Pakong Thermal Power Plant, the related transmission work
and the Study of Future Generation and Transmission Projects were executed as
planned. The power pl!4nt has enabled EGAT to use natural gas, an indigenous
energy resource. This plant and the other generating plants recently con-
structed at Bang Pakong have substantially reduced Thailand's dependence on
imported fuel oils for electricity generation.
Power Market

/a   Includes free-of-charge electricity supplied for street lighting.
6.03      Actual growths of peak demand and generation, and energy sales in
the period FY79-85 were lower than the appraisal estimate due mainly to elec-
tricity price increases and the economic slowdown during the period FY80-82.
Economic Re-evaluation
6.04      The internal economic rate of return for the Bang Pakong Thermal
Power Project, calculated using updated information (Annexes 5 and 6) is 262,
compared to 13% estimated at appraisal. The higher internal economic rate of
return results from (a) investment costs being lower (in real terms) than
those estimated at appraisal, (b) the economic cost of natural gas being lower
(in real terms) than that assumed at appraisal, and (c) benefits being higher
than those assumed at appraisal, as a result of (i) higher annual energy gene-
ration due to the increase in the first generating unit's capacity from 500 to
550 MW, and (ii) average tariffs (in real terms) being higher than those
forecast at appraisal.

Least-cost Solution
6.05      The Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project is confirmed to be a component
of EGAT's least-cost expansion program for discount rates up to 13% (Annex 7).
VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
Project Identification and Preparation
7.01      Since mid-1976 the Bank has been involved in many aspects of natural
gas utilization in Thailand. The Bank was originally called in by Government
to provide advise on how to proceed with the gas purchase and the Second
Natural Gas Development Project (Loan 1773-TH). In 1977, the Bank was reques-
ted by ECAT to assist in financing the Bang Pakong Thermal Power project and
as a result the Bank gave early advice and guidance on several issues related
to the procurement process including the use of international competitive bid-
ding procedures, and the protection of the environment. This advice was acted
on by EGAT and enabled project preparation to be well advanced by the time the
loan was approved.
Loan Processing
7.02      The Staff Appraisal Report for the Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project
(Report 2271-TH) was issued on April 5 1979 and the report and recommenda-
tions of the President to the Executive Directors on April 12, 1979. The loan
was guaranteed by the Kingdom of Thailand, The Loan and Guarantee agreements
were signed on August 9, 1979. The loan became effective on May 23, 1980
(paras. 3.01 and 5.04).
Supervision
7.03      The Bank carried out five supervision missions during the period
March 1981 to May 1985. Most of the supervision missions were carried out in
conjunction with the supervision of other ongoing projects, or with sector or
appraisal missions.
Working Relationship
7.04      The working relationship of the Bank with both the Government and
ECAT continued to be very good during project preparation, loan processing,
and project implementation. Recommendations made by Bank missions were
accepted or given due consideration.
Cofinancing
7.05      The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development provided a Loan of KD
6 million which partly financed the boiler plant package and the transmission
lineo and substations. The loan was signed on July 5, 1979.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The construction of the Bang Pakong Thermal Power Station and the
associated transmission system was executed by EGAT essentially as planned and
with due regard to ecological and environmental factors. The project is prov-
ing to be a successful one. I; was completed one month behind schedule at an
overall cost underrun of about 6%.
8.02      The actual costs of the power plant equipment were about one-third
lower than had been estimated at appraisal, but the costs of civil works
nearly doubled because of additional site development work resulting from
worse than expected subsoil conditions and because of the inclusion in the
project of an operations and maintenance training facility and of a water
extraction and supply system for boiler make-up.
8.03      Both this project and the recently completed Khao Laem Hydroelectric
Project suffered from substantial civil works cost over-runs. This suggests
that in the future very careful consideration should be given regarding
whether sufficient investment in sub-surface investigations have been made
before embarking on major projects.
8.04      Several substantial tariff increases were implemented by Government
during 1980-81. This helped restore the financial viability of both EGAT and
the sector as a whole, and enabled EGAT to remit to the Ministry of Finance
about 5% of its net income for FY82 and FY83, and 10% for FY84. However, the
financial condition of both EGAT and the sector should be kept under review as
the impact of the above-mentioned tariff increases has begun to decline.

Least Cost Analysis
Alternative Sequences
1.        The least cost analysis has been made on a program basis.  The
following three sequences, each of which satisfies the current projected
demand, have been compared:
Year      Sequence A              Sequence B              Sequence C
1983      Bang Pakong No. 1       Bang Pakong No. 1      Bang Pakong No. 1
(550 MW)               (300 MW)                (300 MW)
1984      -                       Bang Pakong No. 2      Bang Pakong No. 2

1985      Khao Laem               Khao Laem              Gas Turbines
(3 x 100 MW) and       (3 x 100 MW) and        (2 x 100 MW) and
Bang Pakong No. 2      Bang Pakong No.3        Bang Pakong No. 3
(550 MW)               (550 MW)                (550 MW)
2.        Associated transmission facilities are taken into consideration in
the comparison. Capital and O&M costs for projects common to all three
sequences are not included with the exception of their effects in the fuel
cost calculation.
Capital Cost
3.        All capital costs are in 1985 prices.  Taxes, duties and interest
during construction are excluded. The capital cost for the various projects
are as follows:
Capital cost
(MB)
Bang Pakong No. 1 (550 MW)                  5,407.0
Bang Pakong Nos. 1 & 2 (2 x 300 MW)         9,396.0
Gas turbine (2 x 100 MW)                    1,879.2

Operation and Maintenance Costs (OEM)
4.        The estimated O&M costs for the different power plants are:
O&M costs
(MB/year)
Bang Pakong No. 1 (550 MW)                   135.2
Bang Pakong Nos. 1&2 (2 x 300 MW)           234.9
Gas turbine (2 x 100 MW)                      56.4
Khao Laem hydro (3 x 100 MW)                 132.1
The costs of the transmission system are assumed to be 1.5% of the capital
cost.
Fuel Cost
5.        The fuel costs of the alternative programs are calculted by an
energy balance study on a system basis, taking into consideration the follow-
ing factors:
(a)  maximum generation or energy capability of various plants;
(b) scheduling of energy generation according to merit order operation
so as to minimize fuel costs; and
(c) characteristics of system load.
6.        Fuel costs used in the analysis for various thermal plants are as
follows (March 1986):
Average                                   Distillate
heat rate    Heavy oil    Natural gas            oil

Results Analysis
7,        The total present worth of the three alternatives at different
discount rates are as follows:
Discount rate         Sequence A           Sequence B           Sequence C
(B million) ------
8              31,299.91             35,413.42           32,564.58
10              26,083.97             29,752.11           26,700.00

14              19,014.43             22,026.83         18,922,53
8.        Sequence A is a lower cost solution than Sequence B for all discount
rates up to 150X. Sequence A is a lower cost solution than Sequence C for
discount rates up to 13.26X, demonstrating that the Bang Paking Thermal Power
Project is economically justified on a program basis when the opportunity cost
of capital is at or below 131.
Sensitivity
9.        Sensitivity tests for variations in fuel cost have been made and the
results are shown below:
Equalizing discount rate

2. Ppge 8, Table 3.2 - Allocation of the Proceeds of Loan : TEXT
The actual amount of Category I - Auxiliary electrical,  CORRECTED
mechanical and miscellaneous equipment should be increased from
U.S.$ 25,960,617.57 to 26,068,763.58; and likewise, the actual amount
of Category II - Turbo generator plant package should be reduced from
U.S.$ 31,056,034.18 to 30,947,888.17. This is because the expenses on
services for Control Roam Simulator at the total amount of U.S.$ 108,146.01
should be charged to Category I instead of Category II as already advised
to you by our letter No. EGAT 22102/44201 dated August 29, 1985.
The actual amounts of these two categories-in page 9,    TEXT
Table 3.3 - Project Financing, should also be changed correspondingly.coRREcTED

"and from an in-depth two-year Environmental  iing Prgram given by CORRECTED

CHIEF OF THE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE E URBAN DEVELOPMENT
DIV. OF THE OPERATION EVALUATION DEPARTMENT
RE: PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT ON THAILAND - BANG PAKONG
THERMAL POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1690-TH)
PLEASED TO INFORM YOU THAT WE FIND THE DOCUMENT VERY INFORMATIVE
AND USEFUL AND WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND THE BANK MEMBERS INVOLVED
FOR THE EXCELLENT PRESENTATION IT IS NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH THE
PROJECT WAS 6 PERCENT LOWER & ERR WENT UP TO 26 PERCENT A
NUMBER OF FACTORS SEEMED TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED THE MOST
SIGNIFICANT ONE BESIDES THE TARIFF WAS CERTAINLY THE EQUIPMENT
COST WHICH WAS A-THIRD OFF ( A FIGURE BEYOND ANYBODY'S IMAGIN-
ATION) HAD THESE NOT BEEN THE CASE AND WITH THE CIVIL COST UP
BY 80 PERCENT THE CONCLUSION COULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT FOR FUTURE PROJECTS IT WOULD BE WORTH TO INVESTI-
GATE IN GREATER DEPTHS THE CIVIL WORKS SIDE TO AVOID
REPETITION OF THE EVENT.
WITH BEST REGARDS
BANYAD BANTADTAN
MINISTER OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND ENERGY
