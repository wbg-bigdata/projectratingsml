                        SYSTEMS

                               RESTRUCTING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper introduces revised PDO indicators and intermediate
indicators in the Colombia - Consolidation of National Public Management Information
Systems Project, and any accompanying amendments to the Project’s legal documents.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.     The Project has progressed satisfactorily and there has been much progress
towards the achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO), the project has
already achieved four of its seven PDO level indicators. PDO objectives remain
unchanged and achievable

3.      Project components are still expected to be completed before the current closing
date of December 31, 2013. Project was extended on May 9, 2012 for one year mainly to
accommodate the delay in the implementation of Sub-Component 4.2 (Strengthening of
the Public Credit and Treasury Directorate-DGCPTN) which accounts for approximately
18% of project allocation. The US$ 25 million loan has disbursed US$ 19.2 million with
US$ 5.8 million undisbursed as of January 23, 2013.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

4.      Results/indicators. A change in Project progress indicators to both outcome and
output indicators is proposed (as detailed in Annex 1). There is a change to two (2)
outcome indicators. For PDO Level Outcome Indicator 5, it is proposed to change the
baseline and thus yearly targets for measuring tax administration efficiency. The baseline
value was changed from the estimated (September 2009 value) to the real end of year
2009 value, while preserving the target for percentage of increase in efficiency. The
second change is to drop the PDO Level Outcome Indicator 6 proposing the
establishment and staffing of the Center for Fiscal and Financial Studies and replacing it
with a new indicator measuring the number of comprehensive studies in different sectors
while keeping with the objective of increasing the capacity of the responsible unit for
carrying out macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting.

5.     The PDO Level Outcome Indicator 6 is also reflected as sub-component in Part
D: 3(e) of the project description of the legal agreement. The current description of the
sub-component is to be changed from “Provision of technical assistance to support
MHCP with the development, establishment and operation of the Center for Fiscal and
                                            5
Financial Studies? to “Provision of technical assistance to strengthen the Technical Vice-
Ministry, especially the General Directorate of Macro Economic Policy, to conduct sound
policy making, through the carrying out of high impact macro-economic and fiscal
technical studies?. This change does not modify implementation arrangements or the
budget allocated to the components of the project.

6. Secondly, there are some intermediate result indicators that are being eliminated or
replaced by others that better capture the results mostly due either to a change of strategy
during implementation or because the activities related to them are no longer financed
under the project. Specifically, changes are proposed for Sub-component 3.2,
Intermediate Results Indicator 5, for Sub-component 4.2, the Intermediate Results
Indicators 5, 6, 7, 8; and for Sub-component 4.5 the Intermediate Results Indicators 12
and 13.
