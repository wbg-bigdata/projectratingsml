HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT P.-.0JECT
1. LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN).
Guarantor:            The Government of Mexico.
Beneficiary:          Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE).
Amount:               US$460.0 million equivalent.
Terms:                Repayment in 17 years, including five years grace,
at standard variable interest rate.
Onlending Terms:      The loan proceeds would be relent by NAFIN to CFE,
under terms and conditions which would include, inter
alia, (i) the sub-loan would be denominated in US
dollars, (ii) the onlending terms and conditions would
be the same as the Bank loan; and (iii) NAFIN would
charge a fee amounting to 0I of the interest charged
by the Bank. US dollar to Mexican peso exchange and
interest rate risks would bs borne by CFE, and NAFIN
would bear the US dollar to basket of currencies
exchange risk.
Project ObJectives: The project would assist in achieving the sector's
objectives of: (a) promoting an efficient use of electricity through
realistic pricing policies, energy conservation and improvement of sector
operations; (b) diversifying sources of power generation from the now
mainly oil-based generation; (c) strengthening CFE's financial condition by
implementing a Financial Rehabilitation Agreement; (d) making electricity
available to an increasing number of consumers; and (e) improving CFE's
capabilities to deal with social and environmental aspects of hydroelectric
power projects. The loan would assist the Government and CF.- 'o meet the
power sector's financing needs by providing funds to finance about 32% of
the costs of the Aguamilpa and Zimapan Hydroelectric Power Plants.
Project Description:  (a) Construction of the 960 MW Aguamilpa (66.7% of
the total cost) and the 280 MW Zimapan (32.5%) Hydroelectric Power Plants
and resettlement of affected population; (b) development of a social and
environmental program designed to strengthen CFE's capacity to construct
and operate hydroelectric projects with due consideration to affected
people and the environment (0.3Z); (c) execition of energy related studies
on energy conservation and efficient use of energy, co-generation and
optimization of the operation of CFE's power system (0.42); and (d)
management and electricity tariff studies (0.1%).
Project Risks: Both the Aguamilpa and Zimapan Projects include important
civil works that involve a degree of physical risk in their execution; the
risk, however, would not be greater than the one in other projects
successfully constructed in the past by CFE, as extensive geological
exploration has been conducted to minimize the main risk element. In



- 2 -
addition, if electricity rates are not set at tLe levels required to permit
a financial recuperation of CFE, there is a risk of shortage of counterpart
funds to carry out the project; this risk is mitigated by the commitment of
the Government and CFE to carry out a Financial Rehabilitation Agreement
endorsed by the Bank. Such plan is already being implemented and up-front
actions have been taken.

2. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
A. INTRODUCTION
2.01     Two issues have dominated the performance of the Mexican economy
in the eighties: the overhang of a massive debt, which requires attaining
significant trade surpluses to service it and to reduce its relative weight
over time, and a mounting problem in containing inflation, fueled to a
large degree by fiscal deficits.  "'.3 Governmen-'s present economic
strategy addresses these two issues through a program of structural reforms
aimed at opening up the economy to external competition, limiting the role
of the State in the productive sectors and fostering the development of
non-traditional exports. In addition, the stabilization program that was
put in place in NovemDer 1987 seeks to sharply reduce inflation by
addressing the fiscal issue by, amongst other measures, raising the prices
for goods and services provided by public enterprises, and by following a
restrictive monetary and fiscal policy and implementing short-term price
and wage controls.
2.02     In this context, energy sector policies play a very important
role.  In addition to the significance of p6troleum exports as a source of
foreign excnange, there are Lmajor issues regarding the size of the
subsidies that the power sector has been receivirg from the Federal
Government, the distortions to resource allocation caused by subsidized
fuel prices and electricity rates, and the costs to the economy of
investment and procurement policies in the power sector, which were not
based on economic considerations. The Mexican Government has begun to
address these issues: fuel prices have been raised in real terms (para.
2.09), procurement by public sector enterprises is being opened to external
competition, and under the proposed project, electricity rates would be
increased (para. 2.31) and investment programs would be based on economic
criteria (para. 2.20).
B. THE EflERGY SECTOR
Energy'_Resources
2.03     Mexico is endowed with substantial and diversified energy
resources, both renewable and non-renewable. Its main resources are
hydrocarbons, with reserves of 55 billion barrels of crude oil (about 61
years reserve at the 1986 average rate of production of 2.5 million barrels
per day) and 76 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and gas liquids
(equivalent to 13.5 billion barrels of crude oil). Coal reserves
discovered so far amount to 643 million tons (equivalent to 3.2 billicn
barrels of crude oil); this coal is not suitable for coking purposes and is
used mainly for electricity generation. The known uranium reserves are
14,500 T, but total reserves are probably much larger.
2.04     Of the renewable energy resources, the most important is
hydropower. A recent study identified 594 sites with a theoretical output
of 150 TWh/year, of which approximately 8e TWh/year (equal to Mexico's
electric energy production in 1984) are technically feasible, equivalent to
22,000 MW, of which at present 35Z have been installed. About 400 known



geothermal zones have a potential for the installation of 3,9uO MW in
thermal plants; at present only 182 have been installed. Non-conventional
potential resources, like solar and biomass energy, would not contribute
significantly to energy production in the country in the medium-term.
Energy Demand and Supply
2.05     In 1988, Mexico's gross energy production was 2,038 thousand Tcal
(equivalent to 200 million TOE), of which nearly 91Z was hydrocarbon
production. Gross internal energy consumption was 1,245 thousand Tcal or
1.4 TOE per capita.1   The 1988 energy balance is shown in the next table,
and the evolution of the energy supply and consumption in Annex 2.1.0.

National Energy Policy and Sector Objectives
2.06     The National Energy Program, prepared by the Ministry of Energy,
Mines and State Enterprises (SEHIP) and approved by the Government in
August 1984 as part of the National Development Plan, presents an analysis
of the role of energy in country development, the main problems faced by
the sector, and sets general sectoral objectives and medium term (1984-88)
aad longer term (to the year 2000) targets and strategies. The broader
sectoral objectives are: (i) meeting overall energy demand including export
1/ As compared to Brazil with 1.3 TOE per capita, Chile 0.80 and Colombia
0.70.



-. 5 -
of hydrocarbons; (ii) energy conservation, particularly in the state-owned
industries with emphasis on simple, inexpensive measures to cut down
irrational energy use; (iii) energy diversification away from the current
excessive reliance on hydrocarbons, towards greater use of alternative
primary epergies such as hydroelectricity; and (iv) improving the financial
situation of sector enterprises, so as to achieve full cost recovery. Most
of the goa-i established for the period 1984-86 have been achieved (para.
2.07 through 2.09).
Problems of the Energy Sector
2.07     A major problem of the sector is the high consumption of energy
per unit of output, which has caused a high growth of energy consumption.
Gross energy consumption in the country has grown at an average ennual rate
of 9X during 1975-82; although this high rate was partly due to high rates
of economic growth and urbar.ization and to the transformation of the
industrial structure in Mexico toward more energy intensive industries, it
also reflected the inefficient use of energy, fostered by very low prices
and lack of a conservation program. Energy conservation efforts since 1982
have produced energy savings in 1987 equivalent to 115,000 barrels of oil
per day (bbd), plus an additional 40,000 bbd froum reduced flaring of
associated gas compared to the National Energy Program target for 1988 of
200,000 bbd. Because of these savings, as well as economic stagnation,
energy consumption in the 1982-88 period increased only slightly.
2.08     A second problem is the high dependency on non-renewable
resources, due partly to a biased pricing policy towards hydro-carbons;
their share in internal consumption of primary energy in 1988 amounted to
83Z (Annex 2.1.0). An important potential for diversification is in
electricity generation through the development of hydro, coal, geothermal
and nuclear generation. However, the goal of the Government of reducing
the share of hydrocarbons to 70% by the year 2000 might be too optimistic.
2.09     A third problem of the sector is the poor financial situation of
sector enterprises, which the Government is addressing through a pricing
policy that takes into account border prices, production costs, relative
price structures and development priorities. Much has been accomplished so
far, particularly regarding petroleum product prices: in the period 19d3-88
these have been increased, in real terms, 127Z for natural gas, 1282 for
residual oil, 83% for LPG and 61% for diesel. At the end of February 1989,
the domestic prices for most of petroleum products, were at least at, and
for some products considerably above, the relevant international (border)
prices, the exception being fuel oil, LPG and gasoline, whose domestic
prices despite their recent increases were about 88%, 39% and 83% of their
border prices (Annex 2.1.1). Significantly, fuel oil is an important cost
element in the price of electricity, which itself needs to be further
increased in order to recover the cost of electricity supply. The Bank
supports the policy of the Mexican Government to correct remaining energy
price distortions.
2.1%)    During negotiations, the Government agreed that SEMIP would
execute, with the assistance of consultants under a schedule and terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, a Program to Promote Energy Conservation
and Efficient Use of Energy in Mexico, and a Co-Generation Study. These
two studies are relevant in the context of the energy conservation and

diversification pursued by the Government. Final term3 of reference will
be presented to the Bank by September 30, 1989, the studies will be
completed by September 30, 1991, and views will be exchanged with the Bank
on the conclusions and recommendations of such studies by December 31,
1991, (para. 4.01 b). Moreover, agreements were reached with Comisi6n
Federal de Electricidad (CFE), on the following energy sector issuess (i)
appropriate changes in the level and structure of electricity tariffs
(para. 2.27) and (ii) execution of energy studies related to the power
sector, including reduction of electric power losses (para. 2.23).
C. THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
Sector Organization and Regulation
2.11     Electricity service in Mexico is under the responsibility of one
public utility: Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE), in operation since
1937. It generates, tranismits and distributes electricity on a country-
wide basis, except for distribution in the area of Mexico City and environs
which are served by Compaftia de Luz y Fuerza del Centro (CLFC), a former
private utility, now wholly-owned by CFE. CFE is under the jurisdiction of
the Ministry of Energy, Mines and State Enterpriser '¢MIP) wh4c.
supervises energy-related activities. The Ministry of Finance and Public
Credit (SHCP) regulates electricity prices and the financial operations of
state enterprises, while the Ministry of Planning and Budget (SPP)
supervises the budget and regulates the contracting and procurement
activities of the sector. Finally, the Ministry of Agriculture and Hydro
Resources (SARH) is concerned with the regulation of water resources.
2.12     As established by the General Law of the Electricity Service,
amended in December 1983, CFE has an Administrative Council (Junta de
Gobierno) as the governing unit in its organizational structure, with
overall corporate responsibility for company affairs.  Its Chairman is the
Minister of Energy, Mines and State Enterprises (SEMIP) and its other
members are the Ministers of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP); Agriculture
and Hydro Resources (SARH); Commerce and Industrial Development and
Planning and Budget (SPP); the General Director of the National Government
Oil Company (PEMEX); and three labor delegates. A Supervisory Council has
three members representing the Federal Comptroller, SEMIP and the
Administrative Council. The General Director is the Chief Executive
Officer of the company. The directors of Construction, Operations and
Administration report directly to him, as well as the heads of the
Accounting, Finance and Legal departments. An organization chart is shown
in Annex 2.2.1.
2.13     CFE's distribution activities are carried out by 14 geographical
regional offices with a limited degree of autonomy. A total of about
123,000 persons work for the power sector, of which 92,000 belong to CFE
and 31,000 to CLFC; out of the total sector employees, about 78,000 operate
the power system, 29,000 are temporary workers in the construction force
and 16,000 are contirgent workers for major maintenance of power plants and
transmission and distribution installations. Bank missions have identified
some areas where institution building efforts are needed (greater degree of
autonomy for the regional offices, overstaffing in some areas, improvements
in accounting and inventory management); however, the sheer size and



complexity of CFE merit a management study, which the proposed Bank loan
will finance, to adequatcly evaluate the areas that may need strengthening
and develop a program to achieve this. At negotiations, CFE agreed to: (i)
carry out a Management Study with the assistance of consultants
satisfactory to the Bank, under a schedule and terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank, to be presented not later than September 30, 1989;
(4i) complete the study by June 30, 1991; (iii) by December 31, 1991,
exchange views with the Bank on the conclusions and recommendations of the
study and provide to the Bank a plan of action satisfactory to the
Government and the Bank, to implement such recommendations including a
timetable for implementation; and (iv) implement the plan of action in
accordance with such tinetable (para. 4.01 e).  Annex 2.2.0 gives a more
detailed description of CFE.
The Electric Power Market
2.14     In 1988, the total installed capacity for public service was
23,921 MW, of which 32% were hydroplants (see Annexes 2.3.1 and 2.3.2). In
addition, there were 2,290 MW of captive capacity, mainly thermal. The
following table presents an overall view of Mexico's historical (1981 and
1988) and proJected (1992) power sector:

2.15     In 1988, gross production of electricity was 1,174 kWh per capita.2
Of the total sales of 83.9 TWh, 56Z were consumed by the industrial sector,
202 by the residential sector, 92 by the commercial sector, 8% in
agricultural activities, 5X by public institutions and 22 for exports to
the USA. About 86Z of Mexico's population have access to electricity;
urban population access is 94Z, and rural 67%. A rural electrification
program, started'in Mexico more than 30 years ago, aims to increase access
to 75Z by year 1995. Energy losses are 13.6% with respect to net
generation, suggesting that there is room for improvement. An optimization
study of the operation of CFE's electric power system, to be executed as
part of this project, will analyze means to improve the overall efficiency
of the system, including transmission and distribution losses and plant
utilization. During negotiations, CFE agreed to (i) carry out a study to
improve the operation of CFE's electric power system, including analysis of
design criteria, operating practices, and efficiency of transmission and
distribution installations, under terms of reference to be agreed with the
Bank not later than September 30, 1989; (ii) complete such study by June
30, 1991; (iii) exchange views with the Bank on the conclusions and
recommendations of such study not later than December 31, 1991, and provide
to the Bank a plan of action, satisfactory to the Government and the Bank,
to implement such recommendations, including a timetable for
implementation; and (iv) implement such plan of action in accordance with
such timetable (para. 4.01 e).
2.16     The power sector is an important user of hydrocarbons: in 1988 an
equivalent of 170 thousand Tcal were used for power generation, equivalent
to 8.32 of total gross internal energy consumption. According to recent
estimates, in 1992, 190 thousand Tcal will be used for thermal power
generation (8.5%) and in 1997, 264 thousand Tcal (102). In 1988, residual
oil provided for 77Z of the total output of CFE's thermal generation, gas
152 and coal 82; for the future, CFE will consider the possibility of
expanding the use of gas as thermal fuel, a decision which will depend on
Government policies for the exploitation and uses of natural gas. CFE's
program of diversification of energy resources will be carried out through
the installation of 2,860 MW (of which 1,240 MW will be financed by the
Bank loan) in hydroplants in the period 1989-1997, 418 MW in geothermal
plants, 1,308 MW in a nuclear plant (Laguna Verde, whose first unit (654
MW) is expected to be commissioned in 1989, para. 2.25), 2,100 MW in
domestic coal plants and 4,150 MW in dual fuel (oil and coal) thermal
plants. In order to further increase diversification, the Government has
entrusted to CFE the prospection for coal, as this type of fuel will be
used mainly for power generation; coal exploitation is made by a semi-
public enterprise (Minera Carbonifera Rio Escondido SA - MICARE), of which
CFE is a shareholder.
2.17     In the period 1976-1988, gross electric energy generation
increased at an average rate of 7.1% p.a. The current demand projection
prepared by CFE forecasts an overall rate of growth for gross generation of
6.5Z p.a. for the neriod 1988-1998. It takes into account an increase in
consumption by existing consumers (approximately 4.0%) and the connection
of new services including important industrial loads already requested to

in Chile.

LFE. This projection, which is the result of aggregation of local demand
forecasts, was verified by CFE using econometric models that correlate
electricity consumption with macroeconomic indicators (GDP, gross public
investment and population). The econometric estimates show that demand is
not responsive to price changes; however, since the envisioned real erice
changes are significant, it will be necessary to monitor very closely the
evolution of demanct, to ensure that investment decisions are based on,
realistic estimates. Furthermore, in view of the many open questions
regarding Mexico's future economic growth, CFE's energy demand forecast is
subject to cot.siderable uncertainty; however, as a significant part of
CFE's generation expansion within the next few years will be based on
standardized thermal plants that would require relatively short periods of
construction, future adjustments to different demand growths could be
accomplished relatively easily. On occasion of the annual review of CFE's
Ten-year Investment Program, the adequacy of the demand projections will
also be reviewed (para. 2.20). Annex 2.3.0 presents details f Mexico's
Power Market.
Operational Performance
2.18     During its 50 years of existence, CFE has extended electricity
service across the entire country, reaching high rates of electrification.
CFE has the staff to perform efficiently the planning, design, construction
and operation of the electric power system.   The number of customers per
employee in operation is 183, about average for the larger Latin American
countries. During the last five years, because of financial constraints,
CFE was forced to limit investments and to reduce expenses in the
maintenance of power plants; as a result, the existing installations were
overworked, decreasing the availability of the thermal power plants to 65Z
in 1981. Lately, however, a rehabilitation program improved their
performance (in 1988, availability was 76Z) and the goals are to achieve
international industry levels (over 77Z) by 1994 (see Annex 2.3.4).
Power Sector Planning
2.19     The National Development Plan, approved by the Government in
August 1984 (para. 2.06) establishes global objectives, policies,
strategies and goals. Since 1962 CFE prepares and updates annually a
detailed Ten-year Investment Plan for the Power Sector (Programa de Obras e
Inversiones del Sector Electrico-POISE), which is approved by CFE's
Administrative Council (para. 2.12), getting in this way implicit approval
from the central Government. Considering macro-economic conditions, SPP
and SEMIP define investment ceilings for CFE, which in the past resulted in
investment programs that favored thermal generation (the least capital
intensive option) at the expense of hydroelectricity.
2.20     With the initial assistance of Electricite de France, CFE
developed mathematical models for the optimization of decisions on the
power system investment program. The least cost generation expansion
program established by CFE for 1989 and 1990 has been modified to corsider
an investment ceiling imposed by SPP due to financial constraints. After
1991 no financial restrictions have been considered. For that reason, not
all of the hydropower projects determined by the least cost program would
be started; instead, during 1989 and 1990 several oil fired thermal



-10 -
generation projects would be started, i.e.: Tuxpan (700 MW) and Lerdo (320
MW), which are based on a least-cost investment program subject to a
financial constraint (which is analogous to assuming a higher opportunity
cost of capital). Had the financial constraint not been introduced, the
investment program would have advanced other hydroelectric and dual fuel
(oil and coal) thermal projects, which are more capital intensive.
Considering both CFE's own financial position and the macroeconomic
situation, which in the near future calls for a continued fiscal effort to
achieve the Government stabilization targets, the investment program and
the corresponding financial requirements are reasonable. The Government
and CFE agreed during negotiations that CFE shall: (a) each year during
implementation of the Project, carry out a technical and economic analysis
in order to update the investments proposed to be made in the power sector
under the Ten-year Investment Plan and shall, when making such analysis:
(i) utilize least-cost principles; (ii) utilize export prices for oil
derivate products; (iii) consider all environmental and resettlement costs
associated with making such investments; and (iv) take into account
financial restrictions on CFE due to macroeconomic conditions. Each
updated Ten-year Investment Plan shall include an updated financial
projection to carry out the Plan, and an economic justification of, and a
viable financing plan for, major generation installations not previously
included in the Ten-year Investment Plan. CFE shall review with the Bank
each updated Plan, promptly after it has been completed; (b) execute only
the installations included in the Ten-year Investment Plan; and (c) by
September 1 of each year during implementation of the Project, and at the
request of either the Bank or the Government, review with the Bank and the
Government, the progress in carrying out the Ten-year Investment Plan
(para. 4.01 c).
The Investment Program
2.21     The proposed power sector Ten-year Investment Plan which is
discussed in detail in Annex 2.4.0, is based on a generation expansion
program which considers updated demand forecasts. A total investment
equivalent to US$29.6 billion (constant 1989 prices) is proposed for the
period 1989-1997, during which a total of 15,389 MW would be added to the
system, at an average unit cost of US$1,923 per kW installed for the entire
system; the program includes 59Z to be invested in generation, 21Z in
transmissior. and 20% in distribution (see Annex 2.4.1). Unit costs used by
CFE to prepare the investment program are in line with international costs.
It should be mentioned that durin& this period the Laguna Verde nuclear
power plant (1,308 MW), construction of which began in 1976, will be
completed at an expected unit cost of close to US$2,400 (1988 base) per KW,
excluding financial charges; no further nuclear developments would be
started in the next decade (para. 2.24).
2.22     The proposed investment program is sound, as it adequately
addresses sectoral objectives and takes into account both economic and
financial concerns. However, the allocation of 20% of the investment
program to distribution, although higher than the average 152 invested in
the past five years, is still low, particularly if CFE sets out to reduce
distribution losses, now equal to about 7% (total loss s are 13.6?, para.
2.15). Further allocations to distribution would mean higher capital
investments for CFE, which is not now possible, due to the need to keep



- 11 -
public sector investments low under the ongoing stabilization program. A
proposed future Bank operation would focus on and would help to allocate
more resources to transmission and distribution investments, and would
assist CFE in carrying out programs to improve further the efficiency and
reliability of the distribution network, to extend metering to all
customers now connected directly, and to shorten the billing period through
decentralization of the process.
2.23     At negotiations, CFE agreed to commission a study on co-generation
in Mexico (para. 4.01(b)). This study is to be carried out by SEMIP with
the assistance of CFE, and will consider the possibilities of utilizing for
public service part of the 2,290 MW privately owned in Mexico and possible
incentives for new investments in co-generation as means to reduce CFE's
investments in generation facilities (see Annex 3.1.0).
Mexico's Nuclear Power Program
2.24     The Laguna Verde nuclear power plant, with two units rated 654 MW
each, is located 70 km NNW of Veracruz, in the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
No other nuclear plant is being considered for the expansion of the power
generating system during the next 16 years. Although the construction was
decided by the Government and the site was selected in 1970 with assistance
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), its construction only
started in 1976. The first unit is now completed, nuclear fuel was loaded
in October 1988, it reached operational tests at 52 power in March 1989,
and is scheduled for commercial operation at 1002 power in August 1989.
Construction of the second unit is progressing well and is scheduled for
commercial operation in 1992. The plant has a Boiling Water Reactor with a
Mark II type containment building, engineered and constructed to meet the
American Nuclear Regulatory Commission's safety and environmental
protection standards and codes and licensing regulations - including the
backfittings recommended as a result of the analysis made of the Three Mile
Island nuclear plant accident - as well as the recommended radiation
exposure limits set by the International Commission of Radiation
Protection. CFE has submitted to the National Commission of Safety and
Safeguards (NCSS, empowered by law to exert the nuclear regulatory
functions in Mexico) the Final Safety Analysis Report, and the NCSS is in
the process of issuing the operating licence for the first unit. In the
past 20 years the CFE and NCSS (or its equivalent in the past) have been
able to develop the manpower required to regulate and implement a nuclear
power project to meet international standards of quality and safety, at
present with only essential support from consultants and manufacturers.
2.25     Three Operating Safety Analysis Review Teams-OSART, fielded by the
IAEA upon request of the Mexican Government (the latest one was held in
September 1987), have advised CFE and CNSS on additional measures to be
taken to get Laguna Verde operating without undue risks to the population
and the environment; CFE has followed the OSART recommendations. Also,
twice a year the IAEA safeguard inspectors make the material balance of the
nuclear fuel as established in the tri-lateral safeguard agreements entered
among IAEA, Mexico and nuclear suppliers, in compliance with the full scope
of nuclear safeguards required by the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation
Treaty and the Tlatelolco Treaty (Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons in Latin America), of which Mexico is a party. Nuclear fuel and



- 12 -
radioactive wastes will be stored at site during at least 10 years.
Through an environmental program comprising sixteen stations, a laboratory
and suitable equipment, CFE is doing the radiological monitoring of the
air, water, animal, vegetable and marine life since 1982 and will continue
to do it so through the nuclear power plant lifetime and beyond. Two
important emergency plans are already in place at Laguna Verde: the
Internal Emergency Plan, intended to mitigate the effects of accidents and
to protect the health and safety of the nuclear plant staff, and the
External Radiological Emergency Plan, intended to face, at regional level,
emergencies derived from accidents or incidents in the plant that may
affect the population and ecosystems, including the evacuation of about
17,000 persons in a 16 km radius around the Laguna Verde nuclear plant.
Electricity Pricing
2.26     Since the early '70s, an important issue confronting the Mexican
power sector has been the Government's policy of subsidizing electricity
rates. CFE's 1986 revenues covered operating costs and left a positive
margin of 6.2Z due to fuel costs that were subsidized by the Government
(set a level of about 65Z of international prices).  At that time it was
estimated that the fuel subsidies plus government contributions to CFE
amounted to about 1.1Z of GDP and, consequently were a significant
contributor to the total fiscal deficit, which then was 15.6Z of GDP. The
Government is now committed to a sounder policy under targets included in
the sector's Financial Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA) (para. 2.33) and by
1990 Government contributions would only be required to subsidize low-
income residential and agricultural consumers (or 2Z of total revenues).
Annexes 2.5.0 and 2.5.1 present additional information on CFE's electricity
rates.
2.27     The electricity price issue refers not only to rate levels but
also to the tariff structure, as rates are not in line with the cost of
supplying electricity to each class of consumer. Previous Bank missions
had recommended that a tariff study based on marginal cost principles be
carried out and strategies for its implementation be planned. CFE, with
IDB financing, engaged the services of the National Electric Utility of
Chile (ENDESA) to assist in the preparation of the study, which the Bank
reviewed and found satisfactory as a guideline for policy actions.
Although additional comprehensive studies would be required, CFE has
already started to apply tariffs based on marginal costs to industrial
consumers; by January 1990, 1,000 industrial customers consuming one third
of CFE's sales are expected to be billed under this program. At
negotiations, CFE agreed to: (i) carry out a Second Phase of a Tariff Study
to set up a tariff system based on marginal costs for medium voltage
consumers, under terms of reference, satisfactory to the Bank, by September
30, 1989, (ii) complete the study by June 30, 1991; (iii) exchange views
with the Bank on the conclusions and recommendations of such study and
provide to the Bank a plan of action, satisfactory to the Government and
the Bank, to implement such recommendations, including a timetable for
implementation not later than December 31, 1991; and (iv) implement such
plan of action in accordance with such timetable (para. 4.01 e).

Financial Performance
2.28     Power sector finances showed a deteriorating trend during the
1976-1985 period. Operating income which was positive until 1982, became
substantially negative in 1983. Positive results were obtained during
l984-1986 but again became slightly negative in 1987 basically because rate
increases did not keep up with inflation. During this period, heavy
interest charges on debt resulted in negative net income for every year.
This required subsidies and cash transfers from the Government as well as
large levels of borrowings, some years in excess of the investment program,
resulting in a great and increasing dependency on external funding. In
1988, CFE's finances started to rehabilitate as a result of the FRA (para.
2.33); a positive rate of return was achieved (1.4) and, for the first
time, the self financing rrt4.o was positive (1.8Z). Annex 2.6.0 contains
supplementary information oni CFE's finances together with actual and
forecast financial statements. Key financial indicators are detailed in
Annex 3.4.0.
2.29     Electricity rates fell, in real terms, about 37X between 1980 and
1983; between 1984 and 1986, rates were sharply increased in nominal terms
(136Z, 46% and 120Z respectively in 1984, 1985 and 1986) but due to higher
than expected inflation, they still failed to reach the 1980 level. In
1987, 1988, and 1989 (through April) average rates were increased 1132,
125% and 24%, respectively in nominal terms but, again, the real rates did
not yet achieve the 1980 level due to offsetting inflation.
Government Subsidies and Cash Tranfers
2.30     As compared to the GDP, total Government subsidies and cash
transfers increased from 0.72 in 1979 to 2.3% in 1983, and then declined to
0.42 in 1988, as shown in the following table:
1979    19-3    1985      1988      1989 at
a) In 1980 billion Mex$          48.4   105.9    83.4      18.3      17.4

a/ Bank forecast based on CFE's projections.
2.31     Fuel oil subsidies increased from 0.5% in 1979 to 0.9% in 1983,
and then declined to 0.1% in 1988, as a result of the Government policy of
reducing the difference between domestic and export Mexican oil prices.
Currently, the domestic fuel oil price is estimated at 88% of the export
price. The financial forecasts assume that in 1992 both prices would be
the same; this would require real increases of about 52 per year in the
domestic price between 1990 and 1992, over the international prices
increase - in real terms - of 2% per year.

Z.i2     Cash transfers increased from 0.7? in 1979 to 1.42 in 1983, to
help meet the heavy debt service burden (para. 2.28). Since then, cash
transfers have declined to 0.3Z as a result of the application of the FRA
(para. 2.26 and 2.33). The graph in Annex 2.6.6 shows the evolution of'
government subsidies and cash transfers during 1979-1989.
Financial Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA)
2.33     In view of the serious deterioration of sector finances, and
within its general policy of adjustment with growth, in August 1986 an
agreement for the financial rehabilitation of the power sector was signed
between the Government and CFE, which included as a first step the
conversion of about US$8.6 billion of CFE's debt into equity, leaving CFE
with a balance of about US$1.7 billion debt. The agreement foresees
substantial rate increases in real terms and improvement of productivity
(efficiency targets and operating costs). It also includes actions to
strengthen institutionally CFE, including improvements in organization and
accounting, and establishes a reporting scheme which would be used by
Government authorities to monitor its implementation. Annex 2.7.0 presents
a summary description of the FRA and proposed targets, some of which have
been expressed in loose terms and are difficult to monitor. During
negotiations, the Government and CFE agreed to amend the FRA by September
30, 1989, (para. 4.01 a) in order to define more precisely its terms and to
reschedule the achievement targets, to levels which while realistic, still
remain ambitious, to ensure that the momentum achieved is not lost. The
amendment would include, inter alia, the following targets:
a)   extend the period of validity of the existing financial
Rehabilitation Agreement at least until December 31, 1993;
b)   to limit CFE's short-term borrowing (less than one year) from
internal and external markets to no more than 10 percent of its
annual cash operating expenses;
c)   reformulate the criteria for establishing electricity rate
increases, to ensure that they are consistent with the agreed
financial covenants; in any case, electricity rates shall be
increased in real terms not less than 9X average in 1990 and 9?
average in 1991;
d)   by 1990 and thereafter, funding mix for new investment shall have
the following compositions 401 minimum internal funding, 1Ox
maximum Government contribution and 50? maximum borrowings;
e)   to achieve as a minimum the following performance targets by 1990:
customers/employee: 184; sales in MWhlemployee: 1,150; to annually
update and review these targets, by October 31, of every year; and
f)   include a revised definition of the pi:_.ce to cost ratio (para.
2.35) that would take into account the effects of high inflation
scenarios, or, alternatively, a financial target (i.e. rate of
return, self-financing ratio) which would reflect better the
objectives pursued than the current price to cost ratio. In
either case the revision would require mutual agreement to ensure
that the financial rehabilitation targets pursued are maintained.

Financial Forecast
2.34     CFE's financial situation is expected to substantially improve
during project implementation, provided that electricity rates are adjusted
according to the agreements reached (para. 2.33 (c)). Under these
assumptions, CFE would be ables (i) to earn a rate of return on average net
fixed assets in operation of about 3Z in 1990, 52 in 1991, 72 in 1992 and
82 in 1993 and thereafter; (ii) to generate an average of 602 of its total
financing requirements; (iii) to achieve a debt service coverage ratio
higher than 1.5 starting in 1989; and (iv) to eliminate all need for
Government equity contributions starting in 1991, except for small
subsidies for electric service to low-income residential and agricultural
consumers. The graph in Annex 2.6.5 shows how CFE's financing mix would
evolve as a result of these policies.
2.35     To assure the successful rehabilitation of CFE's finances, during
negotiations, CFE agreed to the following financial covenants, which are
consistent with those established in the FRA (para. 2.33 and Annex 2.7.0)
and w,th the ratios traditionally used for Bank power loans (para. 4.01 g)s
a)  to maintain an average ratio of total operating revenues to the
sum of total operating expenses (including charges for
depreciation) plus interest and other charges on debt and an
adequate provision of funds for CFE's capital expenditures, of not
less than 902 during 1989, of not less than 952 during 1990, and
1002 in 1991 and each year thereafter; and
b)  to seek the Bank's concurrence before incurring on any new
borrowing if the debt service coverage ratio is lower than 1.5;
It is expected that to achieve these targets CFE will have to increase real
electricity rates on average by about 9Z in 1990 and 1991, 102 in 1992 and
lower amounts thereafter (see hanex 2.6.4)
Bank and Country Goals and Sector Lending Strategy
2.36     Within the framework of its general energy policy, the Government
has established the following objectives for the electric power sectors
a)   to promote an efficient use of electricity through realistic
pricing pclicies, energy conservation, and improvement in sector
operations;
b)   to diversify the sources of power generation by supporting the
development of cost-effective alternatives to conventional oil-
fired steam plants, such as hyd_oelectric, coal fired, and
geothermal power plants;
c)   to strengthen the financial condition of the sector by
implementing the FRA, through significant conversion of debt into
equity, rate increases and reduction of operating coptst and



- 16 -
d)   to make electricity available to an increasing number of consumers
with emphasis on low-income consumers and on productive rural
consumers.
2.37     The Bank's role in the sector is to support the general energy
policy of the country and the objectives established by the Government for
the power sector by:
a) assisting the country to obtain added foreign currency for
financing, on adequate terms, the power sector investment program,
through the Bank's own lending instruments or acting as a catalyst
for other sources of financing;
b) ensuring the adequate consideration of least-cost principles in
the power sector investment program;
c) promoting financial policies that will eliminate the need for
Government subsidies, and ensuring that pricing policies lead to
an efficient allocation of resources;
d) prompting the Government to open gradually the procurement in
publii enterprises, including the power sector to international
competition;
e) helping CFE in its institution building efforts, through
implementation of streamlined norms and procedures and clear
delimitations of accountability;
f) strengthening the sector'b norms and procedures on environment and
social matters as related to construction and operation of power
projects; and
g) through adequate policies to promote co-generation and efficient
use of energy.
CFE's Procurement Practices
2.38     In accordance with Government legislation and policies, in the
past CFE restricted its sources to national -uppliers, and permitted
international competition only when no Mexican manufacturer or contractor
existed or had the capacity to do a job. However, after Mexico joined GATT
in 1986, public enterprises, including CFE, are slowly opening their market
to international competition. Under the proposed operation, all of the
contracts financed by the Bank will be procured in accordance with Bank
guidelines (civil works and hiring of consultants). One of the objectives
of the Bank's strategy towards the Mexican power sector is to support the
Government policy of a gradual opening of procurement to international
competition.
Bank Participation in the Sector
2.39     The Bank participated actively in financing development plans in
the power sector in Mexico until 1974, when the Eleventh Power Project was
completed. Until then, the Bank had made eleven loans to the power sector



- 17 -
fnr a total of about US$605 million. Du-Ing the period of Bank
i cticipation, the sector grew at a steady pace and its finances and
i.tstitutional aspects were substat;tially strengthened. Thereafter, Batik
missions visited Mexico in several occasions to consider resuming lending,
but no further loans were possible as important financial and procurement
issues remained unsolved and dialogue with the Government was difficult.
During the absence of the Bank, sector finances deteriorated substantially
as the Government let electricity rates erode, in real terms, following a
policy of subsidies financed by pptroleum revenues.  Only two project
performance audit reports have been prepared for Bank power loans to
Mexico: No. 859 and 1775 for the Third and Fourth Power Sector Programs
(loans 659-ME aud 834-ME), respectively.  Both PPARs show ths positive
contribution of Bank resources to the sector's physical development and to
the achievement of an important technical objective: frequency unification.
They also show the Bank's inability to solve CFE's institutional problems
and to reverse the deteriorating trend in sector finances which resulted in
its long absence (15 years) from sector operations.
3.   THE PROJECT
Project Origin
3.01     In August 1986, the Government and CFE signed a power sector
Financial Rehabilitation Agreement (para. 2.33), which focused on some of
the critical issues that the Bank had been raising and proposed measures to
address them; subsequently and as a response to the Government's interest
in Bank financing for a hydroelectric development project of the power
sector, three preparatory missions visited Mexico in October 1986, March
1987 and May 1987. Appraisal took place in November 1987 and negotiations
in September, 1988 and April, 1989.
Objectives and Long-Term Strategy
3.02     The proposed loan would be the first step, to be followed by
possible future Bank operations, to assist the sector in achieving its
objectives (para. 2.36).  The project  would assist in achieving the
sector's objectives of: (a) promoting an efficient use of electricity
through realistic pricing policies, energy conservation and improvement of
sector operations; (b) diversifying sources of power generation from the
now mainly oil-based generation; (c) strengthening CFE's financial
condition by increasing electricity rates and implementing a new Financial
Rehabilitation Agreement; (d) making electricity available to an increasing
number of consumers; and (e) improving CFE's capabilities to deal with
social and environmental aspects of hydroelectric power projects. The loan
would assist the Government and CFE to meet the power sector financing
needs, by providing funds to finance about 322 of the costs of the
Aguamilpa and Zimapan Hydroelectric Power Plants.
Project Description
3.03     The proposed project is part of the least cost development program
of the sector (para. 3.23). The loan would finance the components
described in detail in Annex 3.1.0 and summarized as follows:



- 18 -
The Aguamilpa Hydroelectric Project: (66.72 of the total project cost)
Construction of a 960 MW hydrcelectric power plant, with an annual
average generatior. of 2,131 GWh. The project is located about 40
km NNE of the city of Tepic. The main works include (i) a
concrete faced rock-filled dam, 187 m high, 675 m wide at the
crest, which will form a reservoir with a useful storage of 2,575
million m3; (ii) a spillway with a 13,000 m3/sec capacity; (iii)
three 215 m long pressure tunnels; (iv) an underground power house
with three generating units, each rated 320 MW; (v) an outdoor
substation; (vi) two 400 kV transmission lines, 255 km total
length, for interconnection with the national grid; and (vii)
environmental and resettlement works related with the power plant.
The Zimapan Hydroelectric Project: (32.5?) Construction of a 280 MW
hydro-electric power plant, with an annual average generation of
1,292 GWh. The project is located 250 km north of Mexico D.F.
The main works include (i) a concrete arch dam, 200 m high, 80 m
wide at Lhe crest, which will form a reservoir witn a useful
volume of 680 million m3; (ii) a spillway with a capacity of 2,960
m3lsec; (iii) a 4.5 m diameter pressure tunnel 20.2 km long; (iv)
an underground power house with two generating units, each rated
140 MW; (vi an underground substation; (vi) rne 115 kV and another
230 kV transmission lines, 150 km total length, for
interconnection to the national grid; and (vii) environmental and
resettlement works related with the power plant.
Social and Environmental Program: (0.3Z) Execution of a program which
w '  include measures to prepare policy statements and field
manuals, to strengthen the central, regional and project social
and environmental units, to salvage archeological treasures, to
develop resettlement and rehabilitation plans, and to train staff
and provide specialized equipment as required, for the execution
of the Aguamilpa and Zimapan Projects in particular, and for the
execution and operation of other hydro projects in general (see
Annex 3.2.0).
Energy Related Studies: (0.4Z) Execution of (a) a Program to Promote
Energy Conservation and Efficient Use of Energy in Mexico, (b) a
Co-Generation Study, and (c) an Operations Improvement Study of
CFE's Electric Power System; and
Other Studies: (0.1?) Execution of (a) a CFE's Management Study and
(b) the Second Phase of a Tariff Study.
Estimated Cost
3.04     The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies
is estimated at US$1,287 million, of which approximately 402 is the foreign
cost. Interest during construction and other financial charges on the Bank
loan and other loans amount to about US$153 million. Local cost estimates
include approximatelv US$135 million of identifiable taxes and duties.
Above estimate includes the costs of the environmental and resettlement
works related directly with the Aguamilpa and Zimapan Projects, as shown in

Annex 3.1.1, which amount to approximately US$12.5 million (current costs)
for Aguamilpa and U3$17.6 million for Zimapan a-id the costs of CFE's Social
and Environmental Program (US$4.6 million current costs) related with
training and technical assistance to improve CFE's overall capacity in that
area. Detailed cost estimates of the project are given in Annex 3.1.0 and
are summarized below:

===s=   _===   =~===a=
3.05     Project cost estimates were prepared by CFE planning and
engineering staff, based on detailed engineering design for the Aguamilpa
Project and advanced feasibility studies for the Zimapan Project, and
manpower requirements for the studies. These cost estimates were reviewed
by specialized consultants, engaged by the Bank, and found reasonable.
Physical contingencies have been added to each project component, varying
from 57 to 30% of base cost, according to the risk involved, resulting in
an average of 16x; price contingency has been added to both foreign and
local costs, expressed in US dollars, at the following escalation rates:
1989-90, SZ; 1991-95, 4Z. It is assumed that in the medium term, the
exchange rate will be periodically adjusted to reflect the difference
between the internal inflation rate and the evolution of external prices.

3.07     The total financial requirements for the project, including
interest during construction and duties and taxes are estimiated at
US$1,440.0 million, of which US$668.0 million or 46? of the total
requirement would be foreign currency.  A Bank loan of US$460.0 million is
proposed to finance 32? of the project financing requirements. Bilateral
and/or suppliers credits for a total of US$147.0 million would finance 102;
the remaining 58? would be financed from internally generated funds (51?)
and Government contributions (7Z).
Legal Arrangements
3.08     The Borrower of the loan will be Nacional Financiera, S.N.C.
(NAFIN), a Government-owned national development agency, which will act as
the administrator of the loan; the Beneficiary of the loan will be CFE,
which will be responsible for the execution of the project. The total
amount of the loan, US$460.0 million will be on-lent by NAFIN to CFE, under
terms &nd conditions which would include inte alia, (i) the sub-loan will
be denominated in US dollars, (ii) the onlendi.g terms and conditions would
be the same as the Bank loan, and (iii) NAFIN will charge a fee amount'ng
to 1OZ of the interest charged by the Bank. CFE will assume the exchange
of US dollar to Mexican peso and interest risks; NAFIN will bear the US
dollar to basket of currencies exchange risk. A condition of loan
effectiveness is the signature of a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement
between NAFIN and CFE (para. 4.02 a). CFE will transfer to SEMIP, as a
contribution, part of the loan (US$2.5 million) to finance part of the
energy related studies (Annex 3.1.0).
Project Implementation and Status of Project Preparation
3.09     CFE, the Beneficiary of the loan, will be in charge of the
execution of the project. It has the organization, expertise and staff
required for its successful implementation. The Aguamilpa Project is at a
level of detailed engineering design, while the Zimapan Project has reached
an advanced level of feasibility at pre-design level and engineering design
is underway (engineering design to bid the river diversion and auxiliary
roads is ready). Although CFE has a long and successful record of
executing hydroelectric power projects without major delays or cost



- 21 -
overruns, and in order to assure that the execution of the Zimapan Project
proceeds as scheduled, at negotiations, CFE agreed to complete the final
engineering for the project by September 30, 1989. No disbursements for
Bank financed contracts related with this project component will take place
until this condition is met (para. 4.01 i). Design and studies were
prepared by CFE's staff and reviewed by the Bank and by an independent
consulting firm hired by the Bank under a Consultant's Trust Fund, who
confirmed the technical viability and cost estimates of the two power
plants.   Supervision of construction of the Aguamilpa and Zimapan Projects
will be done by CFE; consultants and specialists will be engaged only if
required to solve unusual situations. During negotiations, CFE agreed to
hire an independent Board of Consultants, to be composed of
internationally-known experts in hydro plant design, geology, foundations
and seismology, to review the design of both power plants, and periodically
supervise their construction (para. 4.01 J). Most of the construction will
be done employing contractors; however, CFE will also use its important
construction force to carry out preparatory or auxiliary works for the two
projects. Although in the past some projects have had delays beyond
average construction periods (some of which were due to financial
constraints), in general, CFE has a good record in executing projects on
time and within budget. The construction of both projects will be
coordinated by the Hydroelectric Projects Department from CFE's central
offices in Mexico City; local project offices will be fully responsible for
the execution of each project. It is expected that the proposed project
can be successfully implemented by CFE; however, Bank supervision is
expected to be intensive, especially in the first years of project
execution, to assist CFE in the execution of the resettlement programs and
in solving procurement problems in the period of transition from mostly
local procurement to international competitive bidding. Agreement on
satisfactory bidding documents were reached prior to negotiations (para.
?.12). Construction wark for river di-ersion for the Aguamilpa project
started ot April 1, 1989, with CFE's own resources; construction for the
Zimapan project is planned to start in November, 1989, and commercial
operation in July and November 1995, respectively; the official project
completion date for both projects is June 1996, to allow time for site
clean-up and closing of all contracts.
3.10     CFE's Social and Environmental Program will be coordinated by
CFE's Director of Construction and will involve the Hydroelectric Projects
Management Unit, with the assistance of consultants as required. The
environmental works related with the Aguamilpa and Zimapan Projects, and
resettlement of about 3,500 persons in both proiects will be carried out by
the local offices in charge of the construction of the projects. During
negotiations, CFE agreed to 'lire experts in environment and resettlement
issues, to assist ir the execuUion of the program (para. 4.01 j). The
environment and resettlement plans for Aguamilpa and Zimapan were reviewed
by the Bank and found acceptable; a condition of loan effectiveness is that
CFE has made progress satisfactory to the Bank in the implementation of the
resettlement and environmental plans (para. 4.02 b).
3.11     The energy related studies (Promotion of Energy Conservation and
Efficient Use of Energy in Mexico and Co-Generation) will be executed by
SEMIP (para. 2.10). It is anticipated that CFE and PEMEX will actively
participate in the execution of the studies. CFE will be in charge of the
execution of the Operations Improvement Study of CFE's Electric Power



- 22 -
System (para. 2.16), of the Second Phase of the Tariff Study (para. 2.27),
and of the Management Study (para. 2.13); ad-hoc task groups will be
formed.
Procurement
3.12     Funds from the Bank loan would finance the following: (a) for the
Aguamilpa Froject, civil works contracts covering the river diversion and
main infrastructure works, the dam construction and the spillway and power
house construction; (b) for the Zimapan Project, civil works contracts
covering the river diversion, the intake works and pressure tunnel, and the
dam and spillway; (c) consultants for the execution of energy related and
management studies; and (d) staff training and specialized training and
environmental equipment. Procurement of civil works will be carried out
under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank
Procurement Guidelines, and consultants will be hired following Bank
guidelines (para. 4.01 h). Bidders for the civil works included in the
Project shall be prequalified. Due to the limited number of suppliers, the
equipment related with the environment and resettlement program and the
energy conservation study would be purchased under Limited International
Bidding (LIB), with a limit of US$2.0 million total cost and US$500,000 per
contract. Procurement documents for contracts over US$500,000 equivalent,
which represent over 98Z of the total loan, will be subject to prior review
by the Bank. Agreement on standardized procurement documents for the
procurement of civil works was reached prior to negotiations.
3.13     About IOZ of the cost of the Aguamilpa and Zimapan Projects
(US$129 million) is considered reserved procurement and its cost was
deducted from the total cost in order to determine the amount of the
proposed loan; its foreign component will not be financed by the proceeds
of the proposed Bank loan. Such reserved procurement corresponds to some
civil works contracts and minor mechanical and electrical equipment which

procurement. However, the principles of economy and efficiency shall be
preserved as total costs are not expected to be affected in any significant
way.

Disbursements
3.15     Proceeds of the loan would finance the following: (a) 85X of the
cost of civil works for the river diversion and main infrastructure works
and the construction of the dam, spillway and power house of the Aguamilpa
Hydroelectric Project, up to US$320.0 million; (b) 85Z of the cost of civil
works contracts for the construction of the river diversion intake works,
pressure tunnel, dam and spillway of the Zimapan Hydroelectric Project, up
to US$135.0 million; (c) 1002 of the foreign cost related with staff
training and purchase of equipment for the Social and Environmental
Program; and (d) 1002 of the cost of consultants required for the execution
of energy, management and tariff studies, including the cost of the Board
of Consultants.



- 24 -
3.16     The loan is expected to be disbursed over a period of seven years
(Annex 3.1.3), in accordance with the Bank's standard disbursement
profiles; retroactive financing in an aggregate amount of up to US$20.0
million is proposed, for any of the civil works contracts described in
para. 3.12, awarded under ICB after August 31. 1988. All disbursements
will be made through a Special Account, to be established with a limit of
US$35.0 million, equivalent to about four months of estimated peak
disbursements. Documentation would be retained by NAFIN and would be made
available for periodic inspection by Bank staff. Statements of Expenditure
would be used for all eligible expenditures made. At negotiations, NAFIN
agreed to establish the Special Account, its terms and conditions, and to
open separate accounting for all the components of the project (para. 4.01
(k)).
Auditing
3.17     As required by Mexican legislation for all state companies, CFE
has its financial statements audited by a firm of qualified independent
auditors approved by the General Comptroller's Office. At present such
firm is Despacho Roberto Casas Alatriste, Contadores Publicos, which acts
as correspondent of Coopers & Lybrand, an international independent audit
firm. They are acceptable. During project execution, CFE shall continue
to engage the services of independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and
shall present in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank
duly audited financial statements and project accounts within six months of
the close of the fiscal year (para. 4.01 h). During negotiations, NAFIN
agreed to implement controls for the management of the Special Account, and
to engage independent and qualified auditors, to audit the accounting of
the project, including the Special Account (para. 4.01 k).
Environmental and Social Aspects
3.18     Mexico has legislation that sets regulations and policies for the
protection of the environment, but has no specific law for protecting
rights of resettled people affected by new power projects; the "Ley de
Reforma Agraria" (Agrarian Reform Law) regulates the indemnization due to
peasants in the rural communities (Oejidos' and ncomunas') for their lands
in cases of resettlements. For the execution of any project that may alter
the physical conditions of the environment, CFE has to file a petition and
present satisfactory evidence that regulations are being observed, both to
diminish the negative effects to the environment and to compensate and care
for the people displaced or affected by the project.  The Ministry of Urban
Development and Ecology (SEDUE) is concerned with the effects to the
environment by the construction of thermal, geothermal, hydro and nuclear
power plants. The Ministries of Fisheries (SDP), of Agriculture and Hydro
Resources (SARH), and of Agrarian Reform (.'RA) are the governing entities
that evaluate and provide information to SEDUE, so that the latter can
decide on the approval of new hydroelectric projects based on their effect
on the environment as well as on resettled people. SEDUE requirements are
suitable for environmental evaluation of new projects.
3.19     The construction of the Aguamilpa Project will affect about 2,000
mestizo and Huichol indian people, of which about 1,000 will have to be



- 25 -
resettled; the Zimapan Project will affect about 3,500 people of which
about 2,500 will have to be resettled (see Annex 3.1.0). In the past, CFE
has successfully taken care of the social and environmental problems
derived from the construction of power projects; however, in view of the
large expansion of activities presented by the hydroelectric development
program, CFE will have to expand the capability of their staff in this area
(see details in Annex 3.2.0). In order to assist CFE to strengthen their
practices in the execution and operation of hydroelectric projects in
general, and of the Aguamilpa and Zimapan in specific, during negotiations,
agreements were reached with CFE for the execution of a Social and
Environmental Program (para. 4.01 d) which will entail, as explained in
Annex 3.1.0: (a) strengthening of CFE's Central Unit for Socioeconomic and
Environmental Affairs and the four Regional Units; (b) execution of
resettlement plans for the Aguamilpa and Zimapan Projects, and creation of
local resettlement and environmental teams for both projects; (c) a program
to survey and salvage any archeological treasures in both projects; (d)
execution of studies on the effects of impounding the waters of the rivers
on which the two projects are located; (e) development of a set of
environmental and resettlement guidelines; and (f) training of CFE staff.
Loan effectiveness is conditioned to satisfactory progress in the
implementation of the program (para. 4.02 b); failure to continue its
implementation would be a condition for suspension of disbursements.
Dam Safety and Inspection
3.20     The proposed project will include the construction of two dams: a
rock-filled dam, 187 meters high for the Aguamilpa Hydroelectric Power
Project, and a concrete arch dam, 200 meters high for the Zimapan Project.
As is usual in Mexico, both dams, and in general all the structures for
power plants, are designed considering seismic risks. During negotiations,
agreements were reached that CFE shall propose to the Bank appLopriate
arrangements for the Bank's review not laer than one year before the
expected completion of each dam and related infrastructure works, with
respect to post-construction inspection and operation.
Performance Indicators
3.21     The Financial Rehabilitation Agreement includes a reasonable
number of indicators, which represent an improvement of CFE's technical and
financial performance. Annex 3.4.0 shows a set of performance indicators
derived from the FRA and the financial targets agreed with CFE. The Bank
would monitor CFE's performance achievements through supervision missions
and semiannual project progress reports to be prepared by CFE.
Risks
3.22     Despite the seismic conditions in Mexico, physical risks are
expected to be less than average in this type of work, as extensive
geological exploration has been conducted and additional preparation
studies are being carried out before proceeding with construction of both
projects and the Mexicans have successfully implemented similar projects in
the past. Independent experts hired by the Bank under a Consultant's Trust
Fund, have confirmed the technical viability and reviewed the design and
cost estimates of the two power plants, including geological conditions.



- 26 -
The resettlement risks are expected to be minimal as adequate measures will
be implemented before and during project execution. Failure to implement
adequately the FRA would adversely affect sector finances and could result
itl delays of the execution of the CFE's investment program.
Economic Justification
3.23     The proposed Aguamilpa and Zimapan Hydroelectric Projects are part
of CFE's Ten-year Investment Program. A least-cost analysis shows that the
two projects represent the most economical solution to satisfy CFE's
generation expansion requirements. Had CFE chosen to build thermal plants
with approximately equivalent energy generation capacity, the incremental
cost to the economy in present value terms is estimated to amount to
US$348.0 million (at a discount rate of 11Z) or 41? higher than the
hydroelectric alternative. Annex 3.3.? shows the result of the comparison.
3.24     It is not feasible to calculate a rate of return for an individual
generation project, as benefits are contingent upon complementary
investments in transmission and distribution and upon the coordinated
operation of the two projects within CFE's power generation system. Hence,
the internal rate of return (IRR) of the total 1989-1997 CFE's investment
program was computed as the discount rate equa'izing the present values of
the stream of costs and benefits associated with it. The cost stream,
expressed in 1989 constant prices, includes: (i) the overall investment
program, including environmental and resettlement costs; and (ii)
incremental operation and maintenance costs. All inputs, including fuel,
are priced at their opportunity cost. Taxes and inte.nal transfers are
excluded. As a proxy for benefits, the revenues derived from incremental
energy sales were applied, at the retail rates considered to reach the
goals of the FRA which entail reaching long-run marginal costs by the year
1996. The economic evaluation is conservative, since no attempt was made
to reflect other benefits to the economy of the country: the dam to be
constructed at the Aguamilpa Project would regulate the river flow and
would provide the possibilities for irrigation of an area of 70,000
hectares suitable for agriculture, and would provide for improved flood
control; neither of these benefits have been quantifted. Consumer surplus
would be a significant benefit which has not been quantified either (data
from other countries shows that the cost of energy not supplied to industry
may be 10 to 30 times the prevailing electricity rate). Annex 3.3.0
presents details of the economic analysis and sensitivity tests. Based on
the above assumptions, the internal rate of return for the proposed
investment program is 13Z. Sensitivity analyses show the rate of return to
be very sensitive to changes in electricity rates (IRR is about 112 if
rates are 102 lower) and to energy sales (IRR is 112 if sales grow at 1I
p.a. lower than forecast), relatively sensitive to capital cost increases,
and to fuel cost increases (IRR is about 12? if these costs are 10? higher)
and, moderately sensitive to change in operation and maintenance costs.
3.25     The analysis confirms the economic merits of the proposed
investment; if rates are set at levels in accordance with the requirements
of the FRA, the rate of return on the investment program would be above the
estimated cost of capital in Mexico (approximately 11Z).

CFE: Institutional Aspects
Background and Ownership
1.       CFE is a decentralized entity of the Mexican Government,
originallv established by Presidential Decree in ,933; it started
operations in 1937. Although it was created with the objective of meeting
electricity demand in those areas that were not attractive for private
owned utilities, the creation of CFE meant the initiation of a process of
total Government ownership of electric utilities which culminated in 1960.
2.       Article 27 of the Mexican Constit'stion, as amended in 1960, grants
to the Government the exclusive right to provide electric power services to
the public. As part of this program, CFE acquired the assets of American
Foreign Power Company, including the generatihn and distribution facilities
of the most important cities outside of Mexico City, including ten state
capitals, and some agricultural and industrial areas. CFE also acquired
majority ownership of the Mexican Light and Power Company (Mexlight), a
Canadian electric utility established in the 1800s. Mexlight installations
were transferred co a separate legal entity, Compafila de Luz y Fuerza del
Centro (CLFC). CLFC exists as a separate public entity controlled by CFE
and supplies electric power purch.,sed from CFE to Mexico City. CLFC is
under a liquidation process which is being carried out slowly, largely due
to the labor problems which might be caused by the integration of CLFC's
organization into CFE, as the workers have different unions and their
contracts provide for different benefits.
Relationship with the Government
3.       As a decentralized public agency, CFE is subject to the control of
the Federal Government through the Ministry of Energy, Mines and State
Enterprises (SEMIP). The annual budget of CFE is submitted to the Ministry
of Planning and Budget (SPP) for its review and inclusion in the Federal
Budget which is subject to approval by the House of Representatives.
Electricity tariffs, as most public sector prices, are determined by a unit
under the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) based on requests
presented by CFE and taking macroeconomic conditions into account.
Organization
4.       As established by the Electric Energy Public Service Law, amended
in December 1983, CFE has an Administrative Council (Junta de Gobierno) as
the governing unit in its organizational structure, with overall corporate
responsibility for company policy and supervision of its overall corporate
affairs. Its Chairman is the Minister of SEMIP and its other members are



- 33 -
ANNEX 2.2.0
Page 2 of 6
the Ministers of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP); Agriculture ard Hydro
Resources (SARH); and Planning and Budget (SPP); the General Director of
the State Oil Company (PEMEX); and three labor delegates. A Supervisory
Council has three members representing the Federal Comptroller, SEMIP and
the Administrative Council. The General Director is the Chief Executive
Officer of the company. The Directors of Construction, Operations and
Administratior. report directly to him as well as the Comptroller and the
heads of Finance, Legal Department and Social Communications. The company
is divided for each one of its functional areas in different geographical
regions which have limited autonomy as most of the major decisions are
taken at headquarters. CFE's organization is adequate for a company with
its characteristics but a system of decentralized authority, giving the
regional offices a greater degree of autonomy, needs to be established.
Management
5.       CFE is well managed, considering its size and the market it
serves.  It has qualified and competent managers and an adequate management
information system.  The particular conditions created by Meir4can culture
and economy, characterized by a significant concentration of power in the
Federal Goveriment and by using the state owned companies to foster the
macroeconomic and social objectives of the Government (such as employment
targets and promotion of local industry), have placed some constraints on
management which, however, have not resulted in costs which are out of line
with international standards. A feature common to Mexican state-owned
companies is the significant participation of labor representatives in the
decision making process; at CFE they are members of the Administrative
Council and other collegiate bodies in the organization. Their
participation has allowed smooth labor relations within the company as the
union has taken the company's objectives as their own.
Information Systems
6.       The data processing unit of CFE, located in the Mexico City
headquarters, operates the information systems related to the national
offices and assists and monitors the regional offices in the creation and
implementation of the norms and procedures of the company regarding data
processing. The system has the following objectives: (a) to establish an
interconnected net of local and regional computer systems; (b) a system
master plan with operational and strategic components; and (c) a quality
control program. During the next five years, it plans to implement the
following projects: (i) complete tho computerized billing arld collection
system by including small isolated localities and by consolidating the
information on a regional basis; (ii) set up an inventories system, under
national norms and procedures, which would allow a better administration
and control of stocks; (iii) the integration of the accounting and budget
information of the company; and (iv) administration and control of human
resources. Parallel to these projects, there is a plan for the acquisition
of the equipment required for their adequate implementation.

Staffing and Training
7.       CFE's personnel policy is to promote the integral development of
its human resources in line with the development of the company. For this
purpose and within the general tradition established for Government-owned
entities in Mexico, labor relations are managed in close coordination
between the company and the labor union reflected in a labor contract which
is renegotiated every two years. The one presently in force constitutes,
in fact, the personnel manual of the company as it sets the policies and
procedures for human resources administration.
8.       The sector is tbe second major employer in the country, after the
state oil company (PEMEX). At the end of 1988, it had a total of 123,000
employees of which 92,000 belonged to CFE and 31,000 to CLFC. Out of the
total sector employees, 78,000 operate the power system, 29,000 are
temporary workers in the construction force and 16,000 are contingent
workers for major maintenance of power plants and transmission and
distribution installations. The evolution of the sector operational staff
is shown in Annex 3.4.0 (Performance and Financial Indicators).
9.       CFE has a comprehensive training program and adequate facilities
to implement it. A Central Unit for Training and Development establishes
the basic norms, plans, organization, evaluation and coordination of the
program to be applied at a national level and it implements the training
activities for the headquarters personnel. The regional distribution
offices are in charge of regional training centers and the implementation
of their corresponding activities. The training activities cover all
aspects of CFE's operations, including engineering and design, operation
and maintenance, safety, public and community relations, finances and
administration and general education. In 1987, about 48,000 employees
participated in 5,300 courses and seminars, with an average attendance of
about six hours per participant.
Accounting and Auditing
10.      CFE's accounting unit is under the Deputy Comptroller who reports
to the Comptroller. The company's accounting system reflects the
institutional objective of delegation of functions to the regional offices.
This objective is in the process of being achieved by delegating more
functions to the regional offices and leaving for the central unit at
headquarters the consolidation of the accounting information, the
registration of entries for the national offices and the establishment of
norms and procedures for functions in general. Many of the new systems are
being incorporated under the data processing projects now under execution
(para 6).
II.      CFE has a system of accounts that consists of a computer listing
with a detailed description of each account. The external auditors report
for the 1987 financial statements show that some deficiencies exist both in
the accounting system and in the internal control system. These



- 35 -
ANNEX 2.2.0
Page 4 of 6
deficiencies notwithstanding, the company issues reliable monthly financial
statements within thirty days. One matter which needs assessment is the
valuation of CFE's assets, as (i) CFE's assets may be overvalued as the
revaluation index that has been used has exceeded the consumer price index
for several years, (ii) the depreciation quota (2.9Z) seems to be low for a
power utility with 76% of thermal generation, and (iii) all intereet is
charged to income, and no charge for interest during construction is made.
12.      The internal audit unit of CFE also reports to the Comptroller.
It has regional un'ts assigned to the operations divisions and to the
construction coordinating units. The central unit establishes the norms
and procedures for auditing within the company and monitors their adequate
implementation. CFE, by law, has to engage the ervices of external
auditors registered under the country's General omptroller Office. At
present such firm is Despacho Roberto Casas Alat-iste, Contadores Publicos,
which acts as correspondent of Coopers & Lybrand, an international
independent audit firm. Both firms are acceptable to the Bank. During
project execution, CFE will engage the services of independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and will present in accordance with terms &e
reference acceptable to the Bank duly audited financial statem: :.s, project
accounts and statements of expenditures related to the project within six
months after the end of each year. In addition, the Special Account to be
opened under the Bank loan will also be audited in accordance with terms of
reference and by an auditing firm, both acceptable to the Bank.
Budgeting and Planning
13.      As a Government-owned entity, CFE follows the general principles
of fiscal budgeting established by the Mexican Government which is
basically a cash budget. The unit in charge of budget preparation is under
the Finance Department while the unit in charge of budget control is under
the Comptroller. The company has a coherent management information and
control system. Besides budget preparation, the Budget Department is
basically in charge of the accounts payable system. Financial projections
are prepared by the Economic and Planning Studies Lnit under the
Construction Directorate, which is in charge of the medium and long-term
planning of the company. This unit also prepares the sales forecast and
the long-term investment program of the company, based on least cost
principles (The main text, para 2.19 and 2.20, provides an explanation of
the planning scheme used by the company).
Procurement and Inventories
14.      CFE is subject to national legislation dealing wIth procurement of
goods and services following Government directives.  In the past, CFE
restricted its sources to national suppliers, and permitted international
competition only when no Mexican manufacturers existed.  However, after
Mexico joined GATT in 1986, public entittes, including CFE, are slowly
opening their market to international. competition. Under Bank's present
and possible future operations, all troeurement shall be made under
international competitive bidding.



- 36 -
ANNEX 2.2.0
Page 5 of 6
15.      CFE's purchases are made by the Technical Services Unit (civil
works) and the Supplies Unit (goods) and the regional offices which are
authorized to make small and medium purchases.  The size and complexity of
the enterprise have resulted in a list of about 400,000 items purchased by
CFE.  To safeguard and handle these items, CFE has 421 warehouses which at
the end of 1986 had a stock of about US$390 million, of which about 23Z
were for operation and maintenance and 77Z for construction. As opposed to
the general philosophy of concentration that existed in the company until
1985, the warehouses seem to have had excessive autonomy. There are no
coordinated systems of inventory management and clearly defined policies
regarding obsolescence. The company also lacks a clearly defined
nomenclature of goods which would suprort a well managed inventory system
and avoid unnecessary duplication of names. Preliminary efforts are being
made by CFE to implement a data processing system which would-provide the
necessary information for management decision. The problems outlined above
shall be reviewed under the management study financed by the Bank loan.
Billing and Collection
16.      Billing and collection at CFE are successfully carried out by the
regional offices, with a good degree of coordination at the national level.
CFE is divided in 14 regional distribution divisions, each division is
divided ir, zones for a total of 100 and each zone in agenciec for a total
of 850. The computerized billing system is centralized in the regional
divisions while bill collection is made at each zone and agency. As a next
step in the deconcentration process, and with the intention of accelerating
the collection process, CFE intends to move the billing process to the
zones. The collection system of CFE is reasonably efficient as the
collection period is about 60 days and the uncollectable accounts represent
only 0.1Z of total billing. An important factor for this achievement, rare
for Latin-American utilities, is a compensation mechanism operating under
the federal budget system for collecting from other public enterprises and
from Government agencies. However, the collection record of CFE seems to
be under an initial process of deterioration as many districts are falling
behind, basically because of the significant nominal tariff increases of
the last year, especially in those states where opposition parties have
become stronger and represent an important challenge to the Government
party. Major problem related to consumer billing is the lack of meters
(about one million at present) due to the financial constraints facing CFE.
The Bank has initiated the preparation of a follow up project which would
focus on CFE's distribution needs, under which these problems would be
addressed.
General Services
17.      The General Services Unit of CFE has, among other functions, the
responsibility for the air and land transportation systems of CFE. At
present, CFE has a fleet of ten airplanes which, in 1986, were 802 of the
time available for service, flew 1,633 hours and carried 6,678 passengers.
The helicopter fleet flew 5,262 hours transporting about 4,000 tons and
19,772 passengers.

This service warrants an in-depth assessment regarding its economic
convenience as compared with procuring it from private companies. The
financial constraints encounter-d by the company have resulted in the aging
of the existing fleet which has reached an average of eight years. This
and the normative matters regarding land transportation shall be reviewed
under the management study to be carried out under the present operation.
Insurance
18.      The Insurance Unit of CFE is in charge of contracting, processing,
statistical control, signature and general administration of the insurance
policies of the company. The coverage of these policies include
transportation, fire and vehicles. but does not include plant breakdown and
damage to third parties. These aspects shall be analyzed under the
management study.

HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Electric Power Market
Description of the Electric Power System
1.       CFE is in charge of the planning, development and operation of
installations for the entire country; as the geographical area is extense
(approximately 2.0 million km2) and the power system large (23,900 MW
installed capacity), CFE has divided its activities by geographical
regions. Corporate planning and the engineering and design activities of
larger projects are carried out centrally at CFE's headquarters in Mexico
City.  For the construction and operation of other power system components,
the country has been divided in the following regions, which operate with a
limited degree of autonomy from the central offices:
Hydroelectric power plants                 5 regions
Thermoelectric power plants                5 regions
Transmission lines                         7 regions
Distribution networks                     14 regions
2.       The Central distribution region, where Mexico City iz ;ocated,
accounts for 25? of all energy consumption. Except for the Yucatan and
Baja California areas, most of the country is interconnected through high
voltage (400 kV and 230 kV) transmission lines. There are, however, power
transmission limitations in the interconnection among regions that do not
permit the full exchange of power plant reserve; in some cases CFE has
decided to reinforce the interconnection, but in others, because of the
large distances involved, it has been determined that it is more economical
to add more generating capacity than to invest in transmission facilities.
3.       At the end of 1988, CFE had a total installed capacity of 23,921
MW, 56,000 Km of high voltage (115 kV, 230 kV and 400 kV) interconnecting
transmission lines, 255,000 Km of distribution lines and 16,500 MVA of
distribution transformers through which about 502 of electric energy is
sold, the rest is sold at high voltages. Annex 2.3.1 shows the evolution
of CFE's system in the past, and Annex 2.3.2 the existing power plants as
of December 31, 1988.
Operation of CFE's Power System
4.       The National Center for Energy Control (Centro Nacional de Control
de Energia, CENACE), which operates under CFE's Director of Operations, is
in charge of the control of the operations of the power system in the
entire country, including the control of fuel supply for the thermal plants
and water reservoir level for hydroplants.  The system is operated



- 40 -
ANNEX 2.3.0
Page 2 of 3
considering service reliability, economy of operation and quality (voltage
level) of service. The structure of CENACE includes a Central Control
Group (Centro Nacional de Control, CNC), which counts with modern
facilities such as a real-time computerized central load dispatch center
and off-line programming facilities to determine short-term (daily and
weekly) planning or medium- and long-term analysis for the operation of the
system under normal and emergency conditions. There are also six regional
control centers (Centros de Control de Area, CCA), in charge of the
operation f their respective areas; they also count with modern
facilities, including computer installations, remote terminals at main
power plants and substations, etc.
Demand Forecast
5.       CFE has developed an econometric model to study the evolution of
electricity demand; thE' model has shown a good correlation with statistical
data and good forecasting qualities; it is based on correlations of
electricity consumption with population, gross public investment and
internal gross production. The demand forecast on which the Investment
Program is based, was determined by CFE (Annexes 2.3.5 and 2.3.6) based on
aggregation of short- and medium-term demand forecasts made by the
distribution regions and an analysis made with the help of the above
aggregate model; for the decade 1988-98, demand (gross generation) is
forecasted to grow at 6.5% as compared to 7.1X of the previous period
(1976-88). This scenario assumes that population will grow at an average
of 2.161 during the period, public investment at 8.7% in real terms and GDP
at 5.12. Despite many attempts, CFE has not been able to establish a
statistically significant correlation between electricity demand and
tariffs with long lasting effects. This will continue to be studied, as
the real electricity rate increases required over the next few years are
substantial.
6.       Several other scenarios were analyzed by CFE: the low growth
scenario shown in Annex 2.3.6 assumes a GDP growth of 3.8Z and 7.OZ for
public investment for the period, and results in an electricity demand
growth of 5.62; another scenario considered zero growth for public
investment and GDP, and resulted in a 4.02 electricity demand growth for
the 1987-92 period. These results lead to conclude that at least in the
short run, the growth of electricity demanded by existing consumers and
population is not heavily influenced by economic development. The
influence of the increase in activity of the parallel or secondary economy,
not accounted for in official figures, is also a definite factor of demand
of electricity services. Based on the assumption that the Mexican economy
will grow to accomodate at least the growth of active population (about
3.5Z per year), CFE has decided to use the first growth scenario for
planning purposes. Any deviations in the short- and medium-term will be
corrected by advancing or delaying the construction of thermal power
plants.

ANNEX 2.3.0

Energy and Capacity Balances
7.       The generation expansion program for the period 1989-97 includes
the conetruction of a total of 15.590 MW in new power plants, of which
2,860 MW (182) are hydro (see Annex 2.3.3). Energy and capacity balances
(Annexes 2.3.7 and 2.3.8) prepared for the CFE's global system, consider
the above program, and take into account existing restrictions to energy
transfer among regions because of limitations in the transmission systems
or the lack of interconnection (para 2 above), and restrictions during the
testing period of new generating plants or restrictions in hydro plants
during dry hydrological years. It is considered that the availability of
thermal plants, which was very low in the past, will gradually improve to
industry levels (Annex 2.3.4).

COMISION FEDERAL DE ELECTRICIDAD
Power Sector Investment Program
Investments in the Power Sector: a Retrospective View
1.       In the past, investments in the power sector were sizable as
compared to gross public investment (GPI): in the decade of the oil boom of
the 70's, CFE's investment were an average of 132 of GPI; in 1982, CFE's
investments reached about US$2.1 billion (1989 constant currency) or 9.5X
of GPI, but then they declined to about US$1.2 billion in 1986, 1987 and
1988, reflecting restrictions imposed by the Government because of
macroeconomic conditiors (see Annex 2.4.1). The investment restrictions of
the last five years did not permit CFE to carry out a least cost investment
program, but rather a program in which hydroelectric and other non oil-
based projects were postponed and investments in power plant maintenance
and upgrading and transmission and distribution networks were restricted to
minimum levels; these restrictions have not yet caused measurable negative
effects to the quality of service, but if not corrected through adequate
investment, may 'bring serious problems to the power sector, among others:
decrease of power plant reserves, increase of energy losses, decrease of
thermal power plant availability and efficiency, etc. This, in turn, would
affect the reliability of service, which is of particular importance to
industry.
Future Investments
2.       CFE has developed computer models to analyze the expansion
programs for generation and transmission facilities and determine a least
cost investment program. Based on yearly reviews of the power market
projections and considering border prices, CFE determines a Ten-year
Investment Plan for the Power Sector (Programa de Obras e Inversiones del
Sector Electrico, POISE). The models reflect the state of the art in
planning methodology. The investment program presented in Annex 2.4.1 is
not a true least cost program, as it was modified to consider an investment
ceiling imposed by SPP for 1989, and probable restrictions expected for
1990. However, it is the intention of CFE to gradually shift the
investment decisions to least cost principles; after 1991 no financial
restrictions have been considered. As shown in the annex, the proposed
investment program considers a gradual recuperation of the investment in
the power sector as compared to the GPI, surpassing past relative levels
after 1991. If appropriate tariff policies are pursued, the financial
projections developed show that CFE would be able to finance its investment
requirements without financial assistance from the Government. Any
deviations from the least cost program required because of macroeconomic

reasons, would be discussed with the Bank at the time of the annual review
of the investment plan (para. 2.20). Annex 2.4.2 presents graphically the
evolution of CFE's annual investments and the growth of the pnwer market.
Optimization of CFE's Investments
3.       In discussions with the Bank, CFE agreed to carry out studies
which will define required actions to improve the overall power system
efficiency and the optimization of investments. The first study will
consider the Optimization of the Operation of CFE's Electric Power System,
and determine recommendations regarding efficiency, reduction and control
of electric energy losses, etc. The second study, Co-Generation in Mexico,
to be carried out by SEMIP with the assistance of CFE, will consider the
possibilities of utilizing for public service part of the 2,290 MW
privately owned in Mexico and possible incentives for new investments in
co-generation (see Annex 3.1.0).

Electricity Pricing
Approval Process
1.       The General Law of Electricity Service establishes the procedure
for approving electricity tariffs. The Ministry of Finance (SHCP), taking
into consideration the opinions of the Ministries of Commerce and
Industrial Development (SECOFIN) and of Energy, Mines and State Enterprises
(SEMIP) and based on the proposal submitted by CFE, sets electricity
tariffs, their adjustment or restructuring.
Present Situation
2.       During the recent past, decrees were issued by SHCP at the end of
each year, for tariff level adjustment during the following year, which
included a substantial increase in January and smaller fixed increases
every month, in order to keep up with the expected rate of inflation.
However, since often the rate of inflation was greater than expected,
electricy rate levels have deteriorated in real terms; average rates (in
1989 US cents per kWh), were as follows: 1980: 4.4; 1983: 2.8; 1986: 4.3;
1987: 4.0; and 1988: 4.1.  (See evolution of electricity rates in Annex
2.6.4.) On December 1988 rates were increased by 24Z in nominal terms.
Until July 1989 both electricity rates and the prices of CFE's main inputs
(wages, fuel prices) are frozen as part of the Government's short-term
stabilization strategy ("Pacto de Solidaridad").
Forecast
3.       Electricty rates have been projected to reach the long-run
marginal cost level by 1996. In 1989, because of the stabilization
program, rates would not increase significantly over the real levels of
1988; rate increase of about 9? are expected in 1990 and 1991, and 10? in
1992 with a decreasing trend down to 1? in 1995. These rate increases take
into account the measures stated in the FRA (see Annex 2.7.0), resulting in
the elimination of a subsidized tariff system, except for some low income
residential and agricultural consumers.
Tariff Study
4.       During 1986, CFE carried out the first phase of a tariff study
based on marginal costs for high voltage consumers (69 kV and higher
voltage). This work, performed with the technical assistance of the
national electric utility of Chile (ENDESA) and with IDB financing, has
been adjusted and updated in a continuous process by CFE staff. At



- 55 -
ANNEX 2.5.0
Page 1 of 2
present, CFE is in the process of implementing the reconmendations of the
study, for example, hourly metering equipment for most of the existing high
voltage clients (type 8 and 12 of consumers) has been installed. A pilot
plan of time-of-day tariffs with 50 of the major costumers was started
early in 1988.   It is expected that by January 1990, most of the
industrial customers with demands higher than 1,000 kW (about 1,000
customers), consuming about 392 of CFE's energy sales, would be
incorporated to the program. CFE has started a public relations campaign
to convince major consumers about the advantages of the tariff scheme based
on marginal costs.
5.       The second phase of the tariff study, to be carried out under the
present operation, will cover the medium voltage tariffs for the remaining
main consumers; it will also include some analysis and follow-up of the
first phase, and the purchase of metering and data processing equipment
required for the execution of the studies.

Sector Finarces
Income Statements
1.       During the last ten years, the Mexican power sector has been
experiencing financial difficulties. The rate of return decreased steadily
from 1977 (4.7Z) until 1983 (-4.1X), at which time the Government's fiscal
problems induced it to increase the level of electricity rates, eroded in
the past in real terms because of inflation. In spite of a significant
rate increase of about 1202 in nominal terms, the 1983 rate of return
reached such a low level because of increases in other costs. particularly
fuel oil which increased by about 300Z. During 1984-1986, the
deteriorating trend in the sectbr's finances reversed and positive rates of
return were achieved; however, in 1987 the rate of return became negative
once again, basically because higher-than-expected inflation eroded the
electricity rate increases. Furthermore, the interest charges resulting
from CFE's heavy debt burden resulted in permanent losses for every single
year since 1976.
2.       In December 1987, the Government, in line with the provisions of
the FRA, authorized a hike of 852 average to electricity rates; this
increase allowed CFE to start to rehabilitate its finances. A positive
rate of return of 1.4? was achieved in 1988 and a rate of return of 1.92 is
expected for 1989 as a result of a 37Z nominal tariff increase to
industrial consumers authorized in December, 1988. Starting in 1990, CFE
will continue improving the rate of return reaching 82 in 1993. Net income
is also expected to be positive starting in 1989 and to continue improving
in subsequent years. To reach these results, electricity rates would have
to be increased in real terms on an average of 5.52 p.a., reaching the
level of long-run marginal cost by 1996. Expected rate levels for the
period (excluding 152 sales taxes), expressed in 1989 constant Mexican
pesos and equivalent US currency converted at the average exchange rate of
2,484 Mexican pesos per one US dollar, are as follows:

3.       During the projection period, the most important component of the
operating costs would continue to be fuel costs which on average would
account for about 33Z of the revenues. The financial projections are based
on fuel prices projected by CFE assuming price hikes in real terms.
Residual oil (Bunker C) accounts for about 632 of CFE's fuel bill; the
price subsidies that still remain would be eliminated by 1992. Diesel oil
accounts for 72 of CFE's fuel bill, and has a price of about 40Z over
border prices. The remaining 302 of CFE's fuel bill is composed by gas and
coal, which are priced at or over border prices. The following table
presents the fuel prices assumed for financial projections:

4.       For the ten-year historical period, a heavy debt service resulted
in a low level of internal funding, which even with Government
contributions was insufficient to cove. the debt service, requiring
borrowings higher than the investment irogram, and an increasing dependency
on external funding. This situation w-.f alleviated in 1986, with the
conversion of about US$8.6 billion of debt into equity (see Annex 2.7.0),
that resulted in a funding mix with 412 of borrowings.
5.       CFEs financing plan for the 1989-1996 period is summarized below:
Current
US$ million       2
Requirements                           26,713.4       100.0
Investment Program                     24,413.7        91.4
Interest during construction            1,278.0         4.8
Increase in working capital & other   1,021.7           3.8

ANNEX 2.6.0
Page 3 of 3
Financing                              26,713.4      100.0
Gross internal cash generation         21,105.5       79.0
Less: Debt Service                      4,692.3       17.6
Net internal cash generation           16,613.2       61.4
Capital contributions                   1,801.5        6.7
Borrowings:                             8,498.8       31.8
Proposed loan                         460.0         1.7
Existing loans                          44.6        0.2
Future loans                        7,994.2        29.9
6.       Assuming that the financial objectives are achieved, CFE would
continue to improve its funding mix and its debt coverage ratio would
improve from 1.0 times in 1988 to over 4.0 times in 1991. CFE would be
able to generate 612 of its total financial requirements between 1989-1996,
allowing to reduce the need for Government's equity contributions to 72 and
borrowings to 32Z. Government cash transfers in form of equity
contributions of US$502 million and US$210 million would be required only
in 1989 and 1990 respectively. Starting in 1991 Government contributions
would be required to subsidize energy consumed by low-income residential
and agricultural customers (about 22 of the total revenues).
Balance Sheets
7.       The poor financial performance of the period 1976-1986 resulted in
a low degree of liquidity (current ratio lower than 1.0), and a high,
albeit fluctuating, degree of indebtedness (debt/equity ratio of 78/32 in
1976 and 60/40 in 1985) which was substantially changed in 1986 (10/90)
thanks to the first set of measures included in the FRA.
8.       The projected balance sheets for the 1989-1996 period show that
the debt/equity ratio will increase but it will be maintained strong and
end up in 1996 as 17/83. Liquidity is expected to be adequnte as the
current ratio would be higher than 1.0 every year. The collection period
is expected to be about 60 days, which is reasonable.

COMISION FEDERAL DE ELECTRICIDAD
HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Financial Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA)
Introduction
1.       In August 1986, the Government and CFE signed a Financial
Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA) which included several measures intended to
reverse the deteriorating trend in sector finances. The following is a
summary of the FRA.
Background
2.       The 1983-1988 National Development Plan and the National Energy
Program establish the following objectives for the power sector: (i)
rational use of energy; (ii) increasing efficiency; (iii) promotion of
local industry; (iv) diversification of energy sources; and (v)
technological development. Public enterprises were required to modernize
and restructure so as to increase their productivity, reduce their
dependency on foreign resources and make the best use of their installed
capacity. The Plan assumes the financial rehabilitation of the state
enterprises through rationalization of expenses and increasing their
internal funding. For the latter purpose, the Plan forsees rate
adjustments, rationalization of existing subsidies, restructuring of local
and foreign debt and Government equity contributions.
3.       Because of a low electricity rates that resulted in inadequate
internal fund generation, CFE had to rely heavily on Government equity
contributions and borrowings to implement an expansion program, in order to
increase installed capacity by three times during the 1970-1982 period as
required by the internal market. Starting in 1983, the Government took
measures to improve the finances of CFE by increasing rates, which
unfortunately were offset by rising inflation. The Government also
provided support throukh fiscal contributions and in 1985 by a conversion
of debt into Government equity (about US$1.1 billion).
Measures and Targets
Realizing that the measures taken until then were not sufficient
to solve the financial weaknesses of CFE, the following, more radical,
measures and targets were established in the FRA:
a)   conversion of about US$8.6 billion of CFE's debt into Government
equity at CFE;
b)   CFE to pay to the Government the amounts of savings in interest
payments resulting from the above conversion of debt into equity,
presumably as dividends, although this is not spelled-out in the FRA;



ANNEX 2.7.0
Page 2 of 4
c)   CFE to start a Ieserve to fund its investment needs;
d)   in 1988 the price of electricity to be equal to the cost of
electricity (including the provision of funds for investment and the
interest charged on debt);
e)   by 1988, the funding mix of CFE to be as follows: 40? internal
generation, 10% Government contributions, and 50? borrowings;
f)   CFE to improve its operational productivity according to the
performance targets shown in para 5; and
g)   CFE to implement an institution building program aimed at
improving the following areas:
i.  accounting: establish an adequate system of cost valuation for
each of its activities, i.e., generation, transmission,
transformation, distribution and customers;
ii.  tariffs: update and complete the study based on marginal costs,
and continue implementing its recommendations;
iii.  organization: define the actions to be taken in the on-going
process of regionalization and decentralization started by the
company; and
iv.  Liventories: continue with the implementation of better management
procedures.
h)   CFE will furnish the Government with periodic reports to monitor
the implementation of the FRA.
1986-1988 Results
5.       The following table presents a comparison between FRA's targets
and values achieved in 1986 and 1987, and estimated for 1988:

c)   Institution building program (current status):
-   Accounting:     establishment of a cost valuation system not
yet started.
-   Tariffs:         implementation of recommendations under way.
-   Organization:   definition of actions in the on-going process
of regionalization and decentralization not
yet finished.
-   Inventories:    improvement of management procedures not yet
started.
6.       The disappointing financial performance of 1986 and 1987 and
estimated for 1988 is explained by the erosion of electricity rates due to
inflation. The lower performance on targets based on electricity sales and
customers per employee are partly explained by the deterioration of the
Mexican economy in 1986 and 1987. On the other hand, the operational
targets established in the FRA were achieved or exceeded by CFE.
Conclusions and Recommendations
7.       The FRA is an instrument that, if adequately implemented, can help
transform CFE into a more efficient and financially s-und utility. During
negotiations, the Government and CFE agreed to amend the FRA on the
following:
i)   extend the period of validity of the existing Financial
Rehabilitation Agreement at least until December 31, 1993;
ii)   to limit CFE's short-term borrowing (less than one year) from
internal and external markets to no more than 10 percent of its
annual cash operating expenses;
iii)   reformulate the criteria for establishing electricity rate
increases, to ensure that they are consistent with the agreed
financial covenants;
iv)   by 1990 and thereafter, funding mix for new investment shall have
the following composition: 40X minimum internal funding, 10?
maximum Government contribution and 502 maximum borrowings;
v)   to achieve as a minimum the following performance targets by 1990;
customers/employee: 184; sales in GWh/employee: 1,150; to annually
upd6te and review these targets, by October 31, of every year; and
vi)   include a revised definition of the price to cost ratio that would
take into account the effects of high inflation scenarios, or,
alternatively, a financial target (i.e. rate of return, self-
financing ratio) which would reflect better the objectives pursued
than the price to cost ratio. In either case the revision would
require mutual agreement to ensure that the financial
rehabilitation targets pursued are maintained.

8.       For above conditions the term "cash operating expenses" means the
sum of all expenses related to the operation of the company, including
administration, adequate maintenance, taxes and payments in lieu of taxes,
but excluding provision for depreciation and other non-cash operating
expenses; and the term "internal funding" means the total operating
revenues from all sources related to operations, less cash operating
expenses, less amortization and interest and other charges on debt.

Proiect Description and Cost
General
1.       In the period 1989-1997, CFE will carry out an investment program
estimated at US$29.6 billion (constant 1989 prices), of which US$13.0
billion are estimated to be foreign costs (see Annex 2.4.1). Within this
program, the loan would finance the development of two hydroelectric
projects, with a total capacity of 1,240 MM; specifically, the loan would
finance: (a) civil works contracts for the Aguamilpa Hydroelectric Project;
(b) civil works contracts for the Zimapan Project; (c) consulting services,
training and equipment for the execution of an environmental and
resettlement program; and (d) consulting services and equipment for the
execution of management and energy related studies.
2.       The project components to be financed are dL-cribed in the
following paragraphs, and cost, financing and procurement details in
Annexes 3.1.1 and 3.1.2.
The Aguamilpa Hydroelectric Project
3.       The installed capacity of the Aguamilpa Hydroelectric Project is
960 MW, and the annual average generation 2131 GWh; the plant will be
operated at an average plant factor of 252 as a peaking plant. It is
located in the State of Nayarit, at about 40 Km NNE of the City of Tepic,
and will use the waters of the Santiago River. The main works include (i)
a concrete faced rock-filled dam, 187 m high, 675 m wide at the crest,
which will form a reservoir with a useful storage of 2,575 million m3; (ii)
a spillway with 13,000 m3/sec capacity; (iii) three 215 m long pressure
tunnels; (iv) an underground power house with three 320 MW generating
units; (v) an outdoor substation; (vi) two 400 kV transmission lines, 255
Km total length for interconnection with the national grid; and (vii)
environmental and resettlement works.
4.       Preliminary studies for the dam were made in 1972 by the Ministry
of Agriculture and Hydro Resources (SAHR), with the intention of deviating
the river to the State of Sonora for irrigation purposes; later, when SAHR
decided not to continue with this project, CFE prepared feasibilities
studies in 1984 and detailed engineering studies in 1985, for the
installation of a power plant. A field review of the project design and
cost estimates was conducted by an independent consultant firm, hired by
the Bank under the Austrian Trust Fund. Hydrology records exist since
1942. Detailed geological studies have determined good rock conditions,
the power house will be excavated in extrusive volcanic rock (ignimbrita
riodacitica); CFE has made approximately 4,500 m of test drilling and
excavated tunnels up to the location of the power house itself.

Resettlement and Environmental Issues
5.       The reservoir will inundate an area of about 13,000 hectares, of
which approximately 270 hectares are used for agricultural purposes; up to
2,000 mestizo and Huichol indian people will be affected by the project of
which about 1,000 will have to be resettled. CFE has prepared a
resettlement program which assures a well organized and fair compensation,
mobilization, resettlement and socio-economic rehabilitation of the
affected population. For the purpose, a Local Resettlement Team has been
formed, composed by CFE staff and with the active participation of the
affected communities, local, state and Federal Government agencies. The
National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) will be in charge of
a survey and any necessary salvage operation of archaeological sites or
objects. CFE will conduct studies and take required measures to prevent
spread of diseases, growth of tropical plants in the reservoir (see Annex
3.2.0), etc., a measure recommended by the Bank considering the
contamination of the Santiago River. Prior to the initiation of the civil
works, CFE will obtain the permits from SEDUE required by law to assure
that adequate measures will be taken to protect the environment and care
for and compensate the affected population.
The Zimapan Hydroelectric Project
6.       Total installed capacity of the project is 280 MW, annual average
generation 1,292 GWh, plant factor 53Z.  It is located in the States of
Hidalgo and Queretaro, at about 250 Km north of Mexico D.F., and will use
the waters of the Moctezuma River in the confluence of the Tula and San
Juan Rivers. The main works include (i) a concrete arch dam, 200 m high,
80 m wide at the crest, which will form a reservoir with a useful volume of
680 million m3; (ii) a spillway with a capacity of 2,960 m31sec; (iii) a
4.5 m diameter pressure tunnel 20.2 Km long; (iv) an underground power
house with two 140 MW generating units; (v) an underground substation; (vi)
one 115 kV and another 230 kV transmission lines, 150 km total length, for
interconnection to the national grid; and (vii) environmental and
resettlement works.
7.       Pre-feasibility studies for the project were prepared by CFE
between 1980 and 1985, and advanced feasibility studies at pre-design level
were completed in 1986; detailed engineering to bid the first two contracts
(river diversion and auxiliary roads) has been completed; engineering for
other contracts is under way and will be completed by September 1989,
staggered as needed for bidding and contract execution. A field review of
the project design and cost estimate was also conducted by a consultant
firm hired by the Bank. Hydrology studies have been based on records
existing from 1960, and in projections of the increase of the flow of the
Tula River expected in the future as a function of the increase of
population in Mexico City, as the river is fed mainly by the city black
waters. Detailed geological studies have been conducted by CFE, based on
field surveys, excavation of 480 m of galleries, 4,000 m of test drillings
and in field observations of an extensive grid of tunnels excavated in the
tunnel and power house areas by mining companies. Most of the project
areas are composed by massive rock formations of the sedimentary and
volcanic type, and no geological problems are expected.

8.       Approximately 23,000 hectares will be innundated by the reservoir.
of vhich approximately 300 hectares are fertile river valley lands used for
commercial vegetable and fruit production, and 2.000 hectares are used for
subsistence crops. Approximately 3,500 persons will be affected, of which
about 2,500 will have to be resettled; a special program has been developed
to compensate the displaced population for loss of valuable agriculture
lands. CFE has also prepared a resettlement program for the Zimapan
Project aimed at minimizing any detrimental effects caused by the project.
As a condition of loan effectiveness, the Bank will assess the
implementation of the resettlement and rehabilitation plans for both the
Aguamilpa and Zimapan sites. SEDUE requirements will also be fulfilled
prior to initiation of civil works.
Social and Environmental Program
9.       In order to address the problems faced with protection of the
environment and forced resettlements, as described in Annex 3.2.0, CFE
agreed to carry out a Social and Environmental Program, which will include
the components stated below.
a.  Strengthening of the Central Unit of Socio-Economic and
Environmental Affairs. now operating under the tydroelectric Projects
Department. The Unit will be headed by a high level Administrator with an
appropriate degree, and will contain an inter-disciplinary team of
biologists, agronomists and social scientists. The Unit will coordinate
and provide assistance in policy matters, execution of studies, supervision
of construction and training activities, associated with hydroelectric
projects.
b.  Strengthening of CFE's Four Regional Planning Units, through the
provision of personnel, equipment, training and assistance from the Central
Unit.
c. Creation of Local Resettlement and Environmental Teams for the
Aguamilpa and Zimapan Projects, to be fully operative before construction
activities begin. The teams will be in charge of completing studies and
cost estimates and developing all activities related with resettlement and
environment aspects of the projects.
d. Execution of a Study for the Salvaging of Archeological Treasures
in both projects; the study will be contracted with the National Institute
of Anthropology and History (INAH).
e. Execution of a Study on the Effects of Impounding the Waters of
the Santiago River (for the Aguamilpa Project) and the Tula and the San
Juan Rivers (for the Zimapan Project), focusing on the effects of water
contamination, control of diseases and aquatic vegetation.
f. Development of a Set of Guidelines for directing the process of
mobilization, resettlement, rehabilitation and environment protection
related with the construction of hydroelectric power plants.
g. Training of CFE staff through courses overseas and in local
universities or in-house seminars, and acquisition of equipment required
for the activities described above.

Execution of Energy Related Studies and a Management Study
10.      The present operation will be the vehicle for CFE and the
Government to analyze subjects related with the operation and efficiency of
the energy sector in general and the power sector in particular. The
following studies will be executed under the present operation, under terms
of reference to be agreed with the Bank.
11.      Program to Promote Energy Conservation and Efficient Use of Ener8y
in Mexico. The ongoing Energy Savings National Program, started in 1984 as
part of the National Energy Program (see para. 2.06) has far reaching
implications, covering all sectors of the economy and the entire territory.
As part of such a program SEMIP will continue the execution, under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank, of the Program to Promote Energy
Conservation and Efficient Use of Energy in Mexico; it will (i) support the
internal regionalization of the National Energy Program; (ii) create
regional infrastructure to promote and monitor the program; (iii) complete
sectoral and regional studies in the use of energy in industry and
services, with special emphasis on standardization of industrial and
domestic electrical devices, the use of energy in water pumping and
household energy savings in warm climates; and (iv) analyze the
establishment of energy saving standards and incentives for industry and
commerce. The program also includes a Co-Generation Study that will
analyze co-generation possibilities in Mexico and incentives required.
12.      The Operations Improvement Study of CFE's Electric Power Syst
with the assistance of consultants, wuder terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank, CFE will prepare a detailed study considering design criteria,
operating practices and efficiency of the transmission and distribution
installations. The study will analyze the possibilities of reducing energy
losses through operating practices andlor new investments in the
distribution system.
13.      The Management Study will be carried out by CFE's staff with the
assistance of qualified external consultants. The objective is to analyze
the organization of CFE and prepare an organizational development program
that will give particular emphasis at delegation of responsibilities
through a process of deconcentration. The study will review the company's
management systems in the areas of human resources, planning, information,
control and coordination, and the in-line functions of construction,
operation, administration and finances. The scope of the study would
include the identification of specific areas where performance improvements
can be attained. A preliminary list of areas identified during project
preparation are: staffing, inventory control, asset valuation, data
processing, specialized training, internal auditing, air and land
transportation and insurance coverage. The implementation of
recommendations will be carried out under a plan of action acceptable to
the Bank.
14.      The Second Phase of the Tariff Study will complement the First
Phase already carried out by CFE for high voltage consumers. It would
review medium voltage tariffs and would make recommendations to set up a
tariff system based on marginal costs for medium voltage consumers.

Environmental and Social Considerations
Resettlement and Environmental Planning at CFE
1.       Although a large body of national legislation exists in the
environmental and social fields (air and water pollution control, agrarian
reform, the protection of cultural property, etc.), and while CFE has
maintained sm7', environmental units within its Planning Departments for
several years, it is not fully equipped to deal with the serious human
displacement and environmental problems posed by the expansion of its
hydroelectric development program. To the contrary, as the economic crisis
has worsened in Mexico over the past several years, CFE has closed two of
its regional environmental planning units (in the Gulf and Southeast
Regions) and reduced its environmental staff in its two remaining units
(the Pacific North and Pacific South Regions).
2.       The following problems inhibit a more coherent approach to social
and environmental planning on the part of CFE:
a) a lack of enough professionally trained staff in the biological,
physical, and social sciences;
b) a failure to consider at early stages all social and environmental
factors from the beginning and across all stages of the project cycle, from
identification through feasibility to construction and operation;
c)  a paucity of scientific exchange and cooperation between the
environmental units in the planning departments of the hydroelectric,
thermal, and geothermal sections of CFE; and
d) a general lack of coordination, until the construction stage of
projects, between CFE and other governmental agencies responsible for
environmental and social planning.
3.       Currently, there are no guidelines, field manluals or policy
statements for directing CFE personnel in the areas of property evaluation,
population mobilization, public information and social communication,
resettlement, and economic rehabilitation; nor has CFE done any systematic
research on the social and economic outcomes of previous resettlement
experiences, such as those at the El Caracol site in Guerrero or the
Peftltas site in Chiapas.
4.       Finally, CFE lacks a long-term vision of its financial needs in
> e areas of resettlement and environmental planning. Usually, budgets for
specific resettlement programs are worked out in the later stages of the
design of particular projects. There are no standard formulae for
calculating resettlement costs based upon proper assessment of the



- 81 -
ANNEX 3.2.0
Page 2 of 3
demographic, social and economic structures of displaced communities; nor
is adequate attention given to the costs of environmental protection
measures such as those relating to water-quality control and reservoir and
river basin management.
5.       What is said above should be interpreted more as a lack of a
coordinated and well planned approach to environmental and resettlement
issues, rather than a lack of interest and experience of CFE; to the
contrary, it is worthwhile mentioning that in the last 15 years, CFE has
built successfully five hydroelectric power plants, which demanded the
resettlement of about 20,000 inhabitants, without major problems. The most
recent hydroplant, Peftitas, rated 426 MW, construction of which started in
1979 and was completed in 1986, included the successful resettlement of
2,420 persons in 6 new towns and villages.
The Aguamilpa and Zimapan Resetclement Plans
6.       The institutional problems t!tlined above were reflected in the
slow pace of resettlement planning at the Aguamilpa and Zimapan
hydroelectric sites. However, with taie assistance of the Bank, CFE has
developed an adequate demographic, socio-economic and cultural profile of
the communities to be displaced; an adequate plan for their mobilization,
resettlement, and economic rehabilitation; and, a set of inter-
institutional arrangements to assure the providing of adequate public
services and technical assistance to these communities during the critical
transition period between when the reservoirs are filled and the displaced
populations are established on their new lands.  At negotiations,
agreements were reached on the formation of the local resettlement units
and satisfactory resettlement plans for the projects (para 3.19).  The
current cost (including contingencies) of the environmental and
resettlement works related with the Aguamilpa and Zimapan Projects is
US$12.5 million and US$17.6 million respectively (Annex 3.1.1, page 2), and
will be financed with CFE's funds.
7.       In order to assure an adequate resettlement process, CFE agreed to
conduct further demographic and socio-economic studies; elaborate further
publicly acceptable and workable resettlement and rehabilitation plans; and
fully coordinate its efforts with the regional offices of the National
Indian Institute (INI), the National Institute of Anthropology and History
(INAH), and the Ministries of Agrarian Reform (SRA), Urban Development and
Ecology (SEDUE), Agriculture and Hydro Resources (SARH), and Fisheries
(SDP).
Impounding of Contaminated Waters
8.       The Santiago River where the Aguamilpa Project will be located, is
contaminated with the black waters from the city of Guadalajara; the Tula
River, tributary of the Moctezuma River where the Zimapan Project will be
constructed is also contaminated with the black waters from Mexico City.
Although experience in existing dams along the Tula River shows that no
uncontrollable problems 'rould be present in new, larger reservoirs, CFE has
agreed to conduct studies as part of the environmental and resettlement
plans, with the assistance of specialists, on possible negative effects

ANNEX 3.2.0
Page 3 of 3
caused by the Aguamilpa and Zimapan reservoirs. The studies will review,
among the other subjects: control of tropical diseases, control of aquatic
vegetation, effects on fish species, etc.
The Social and Environmental Component
9.       In order to address the problems described above, CFE has agreed
with the Bank on the execution of a Social and Environmental Program, which
will include measures to enact policy statements and field manuals, to
strengthen the central, regional and project social and environmental
units, to salvage archeological treasures, to carry out resettlement and
rehabilitation plans, and to train staff and provide specialized equipment.
The program will have a cost of approximately US$4.40 million (current
prices, Annex 3.1.1, page 1) during the project execution period
(1989-1996) of which approximately 23Z will be financed by the Bank loan.
Annex 3.1.0, Project Description, provides details of the Social and
Environmental Program.

Economic Analysis
Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of CFE's Investment Program
1.       The following assumptions were made to calculate the IRR of CFE's
1989-1997 Investment Program (Annex 3.3.1).
2.       Capital Costs:  Includes the entire CFE's Investment Program
(Annex 2.4.1), corrected to take into account the following factors:
a)   Labor shadow prices:  based on the mix of skilled and unskilled
labor necessary to implement the investment program and in regional
patterns of unemployment, the shadow price of labor was estimated to be 85Z
of nominal wages.
b)   Taxes and internal transfers.  Capital costs were reduced by 10.5Z
to account for (i) value added taxes (IVA) charged on local goods which
represent approximately 302 of the investment program and (ii) import
duties charged on goods imported directly and indirectly which also
represent 30% of the investment program.
3.       Operation and Maintenance Costs:  These are incremental costs with
respect to the operation in 1989 required to meet the incremental sales
attributed to the Program and include labor, administrative expenses and
materials and services.
4.       Fuel Costs:  Incremental costs of fuel consumption with respect to
1989, required to meet the incremental sales attributed to the Program were
considered. Border prices of fuel have been considered.
5.       Incremental Sales are calculated on the basis of incremental
energy sales attributable to the Program with respect to the sales of 1989,
at rates assumed to increase gradually to reach levels equal to long-run
marginal costs by 1997.  It was estimated that the following percentages of
total incremental sales could be attributed to the Program:  1989, 02;
1990, 202; 1991, 40x; 1992, 60%; 1993, 802; 1994-1997, 10OZ; 1998, 97X;
1999, 912; 2000 and 2001, 87%.
Economic Comparison of Hydro vs. Thermal Plants
6.       In order to verify that the proposed hydroelectric projects
constitute the least-cost solution, the Aguamilpa and Zimapan Hydroelectric
Projects were compared with an equivalent thermal project based on oil
fired steam power plants for base load and diesel-oil fired gas turbines
for peak load. Annex 3.3.2 presents the stream of costs for the hydro



- 84 -
ANNEX 3.3.0
Page 2 of 2
projects and associated operation and maintenance costs; the capital cost
stream for the thermal projects assumes that gas turbines would be replaced
every 20 years and steam plants every 30 years, as compared to hydro, which
would have a life of 50 years; in addition, the capital cost stream of
thermal plants includes the cost of equipment to reduce contamination to
acceptable levels. Operation and maintenance costs are considerably higher
than those of hydro projects; fuel costs are calculated at border prices
(para. 4). The resulting present value, calculated at an 112 rate of
discount, is 412 higher for the thermal project, as compared to the
Aguamilpa and Zimapan. Annex 3.3.2 presents the results for other rates
of discount and fuel prices; additional analyses were made considering
other modes of operation (higher generation, or higher peaking capacity,
etc.) concluding always that the construction of the two proposed hydro
projects is the least cost solution to provi4e additional generating
capacity to CFE's system.
