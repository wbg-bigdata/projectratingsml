MfMRAWNDUM AND RZCOMMgNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.N.C. (NAPIN)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF MEXICO
FOR A HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN), for the equivalent of US$460.0 million is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be guaranteed by the Government
of Mexico and would have a term of 17 years, including five years of grace, with
interest at the standard variable rate. The loan proceeds would be relent by
NAFIN to Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE), under terms and conditions which
would include, inter alia, (i) the sub-loan would be denominated in US dollars;
(ii) the onlending terms and conditions would be the same as the Bank loan; and
(iii) NAFIN would charge a fee amounting to 10 of the interest charged by the
Bank. The US dollar to Mexican peso exchange and interest rate risks would be
borne by CFE, and NAFIN would bear the US dollat to basket of currencies exchange
risk.
2.       Background.  Mexico is endowed with substantial and diversified energy
resources, both renewable and non-renewable. Electricity service is under the
sole responsibility of CFE, the federally-owned national electric utility. The
most important problems of the power sector are: (i) pricing of electricity below
economic costs, causing a weak financial situation, which in recent years has
required large Government subsidies and sizeable external borrowings; (ii) failure
to open CFE's procurement to international competition for the supply of goods,
works and services; (iii) a relatively low level of investments in new
installations in the last four years, caused by 'inancial constraints; (iv) high
use of hydrocarbons for electricity generation, despite availability of more
economic alternatives, due to a concentration of generation investments in oil
fired thermal plants, which require lower capital costs than hydro plants; and (v)
delays in investments in the distribution network, which if not corrected could
soon cause lowering of electric system reliability, increase of energy losses, and
increase in number of customers without meters.
3.       Within the context of the National Energy Program, the Government has set
out to improve the efficiency of the power sector, expand the use of hydropower,
introduce pricing policies based on economic criteria, and reduce the power
sector's reliance on Government funding. To achieve these objectives, the
Goverment is implementing measures aimed at solving problems of the energy sector
through: (i) energy conservation, particularly in the state-owned industries and
utilities; (ii) energy diversification away from the current excessive reliance on
hydrocarbons; (iii) significant electricity rate increases, with the objective of
reaching economic costs; (iv) execution of a Financial Rehabilitation Agreement
(FRA) to allow CFE to improve its finances; (v) improved allocation of
investments, with important allocations to hydroelectric developments and
distribution networks; and (vi) gradual opening of procurement in public
enterprises, including CFE, to international suppliers.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy is to support the
early achievement of the Government's objectives for the power sector. The
proposed loan would enable the Bank to: (i) discuss with the Government the
execution of its existing National Energy Program; (ii) monitor closely the
financial rehabilitation of the power sector; (iii) review every year the sectoral
medium term investment program and financial plan; (iv) promote measures to



strengthen the sector's capacity to deal with the environmental and aoctal issues
arising from the construction and operation of power facilities; and (v) promote
the opening of CFE's procurement to internatLonal competition. It is also
expected that Bank participation in funding sector investment would help the
Government to obtain resources required by the sector from other lending agencies
and ccmnercial banks. The hydroelectric plants proposed for Bank financing,
represent an important step towards the diversification of energy sources and
selection of generation investments on the basis of economic criteria. Execution
of the proposed project would reinitiate Bank involvement in the power sector and
further l.nding is envisaged in the next five years. The Bank has been absent
from the Mexican power sector since 1974, when the Eleventh Power Project was
completed, mainly because it was not possible to reach agreement on measures to
address CFE's financial problems and on procurement.
5.       Project Objectives.  The project would assist in achieving the sector's
objectives of (a) promoting an efficient use of electricity through realistic
pricing policies, energy conservation and improvement of sector operations; (b)
diversifying sources of power generation from the now mainly oil-based generation;
tc) strengthening CFE's financial condition by implementing a Financial
Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA); (d) making electricity available to an increasing
number of consumers; ard (e) improving CFE's capabilities to deal with social and
environmental aspects of hydroelectric power projects, and ensuring that
resettlement under the project is carried out in a satisfying manner. The loan
would assist the Government and CFE to meet the power sector financing needs by
providing funds to finance 322 of the costs of the Aguamilpa and Zimapan
Hydroelectric Power Plants.
6.       Project Description.  The project, to be carried out in seven years by
CFE, consists of: (a) construction of the 960 MS Aguamilpa (66.72 of the total
cost) and the 280 MW Zimapan (32.5Z) Hydroelectric Power Plants and resettlement
of the affected population; (b) development of a social and environmental program
designed to strengthen CFE's capacity to construct and operate hydroelectric
projects with due consideration to affected people and the environment (0.32); (c)
execution of energy related studies on energy conservation and efficient use of
energy, co-generation and optimization of the operation of CFE's power system
(0.4X); and (d) management and electricity tariff studies (0.1Z). The two
hydropower plants are part of the least-cost program and their engineering designs
are at an advanced stage. The total cost of the project, excluding financial
charges, is estimated at Us$1,287 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$515 million !40Z). Financial charges are estimated at US$153.0
million, and the total financial requirements amount to US$1,440 million.   The
executing agency, CFE, has the technical and administrative capacity to carry out
the project. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, as well as disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B, a timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Mexico are given in Schedule C and D,
respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7391-ME dated May 16,
1989, are also attach3d.
7.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the following agreements were
reached: (a) updated financial goals that would permit CFE to achieve self
financing ratios of 612 in 1990; 632 in 1991; 702 in 1992, and 722 in 1993, and to
earn rates of return on average revalued net fixed assets in operation of 3? in
1990; 52 in 1991; 72 in 1992; and 82 in 1993 and thereafter; this will entail
increases of electricity rates in real terms of 92 in 1990 and 1991, 102 in 1992
and smaller percentages thereafter; (b) CFE to request Bank concurrence for new
borrowings if the debt service coverage ratio is lower than 1.5 and (c) CFE to



-3-
implement a Ten-year Investment Plan; any revisions to the Plan or inclusions of
major generation installations shall be economically justified and agreeable to
the Bank; (d) execution of studies on CFE's management practices and operational
efficiency, and a second stage of a tariff study; and put into effect their
recommendations; (e) execution of an environmental and social program including
specific plans for Aguamilpa and Zimapan projects, studies, staffing, training and
purchase of monitoring equipment; (f) execution of energy studies and purchase of
monitoring equipment related to promotion of conservation and efficient use of
energy, and cogeneration; (g) to amend the FRA, setting targets consistent with
the proposed financial covenant and to achieve performance targets related with
the growth of number of employees, customers per employee, energy losses,
efficiency and availability of thermal power plants, and to annually review the
above targets; and (h) appointment of a Board of Consultants (including social and
environmental specialists) to review the design and to supervise the construction
of the Aguamilpa and Zimapan Projects. Condition of effectiveness would be the
signature of a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement with CFE and the
satisfactory initiation of implementation of the resettlement plans for both power
plants.
8.       Benefits.  The construction of both projects follows the sequence of
least-cost expansion for the power sector. The rate of return on CFE's Ten-year
Investment Program has been conservatively estimated to be 13Z.  However, this
fails to take fully into account the benefits from the project as (a) electricity
rates are a poor proxy for benefits and consumer surplus has not been considered,
and (b) the returns on the institutional and environtental measures proposed under
the project, improved flood control, expansion of the area suitable for
agriculture and the economies arising from opening procurement to external
competition have not been quantified.
9.       Risks.  Despite seismic conditions in Mexico, physical risks are expected
to be less than average in this type of work, as extensive geological exploration
has been conducted and additional preparation studies are being carried out before
proceeding with construction of both projects and the Mexicans have successfully
implemented similar projects in the past. Independent experts hired by the Bank
under a Consultant's Trust Fund have confirmed the technical viability and
reviewed the designs and cost estimates of the two power plants, including
geological conditions. Resettlement problems involving 3500 persons would be
minimized by actions taken before Board presentation and to be taken before loan
effectiveness and we are confident of CFE's commitment in this regard. Failure to
increase electricity rates as envisioned would adversely affect sector finances
and could result in delays of the execution of the CFE's investment program; but
this risk is mitigated by the fact that up front rate increases have been
substantial (nominal rate increases of 84Z and 24? were approved in December 1987
and 1988, respectively) and inflation has been dropping significantly in the past
months.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
