I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Colombia’s First National Communication (NC1) to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) issued in 2001 provided the foundational information for this
project and it indicated the country’s high vulnerability to the expected impacts of climate change,
identifying high mountain habitats, insular and coastal areas and health, as areas of primary
concern. At the time of Appraisal of the Integrated National Adaptation Project (INAP, the
Project), studies commissioned as part of the preparation of the Second Communication had
confirmed and provided greater detail on trends and impacts in these areas. Colombia’s main
vulnerabilities to climate change were found to include the following:

       Highland Andean ecosystems were found to be vulnerable to climate change impacts.
        As elsewhere climate change impacts are particularly severe at higher altitudes. In
        particular, the fragile moorlands, unique to the Northern Andes, with endemic and
        abundantly diverse flora and fauna, as well as with storage capacity for water and carbon
        in the soil were expected to be seriously affected by increases in temperature. The
        Meteorological, Hydrological and Environmental Studies Institute (IDEAM) had
        recorded increases in temperature and decreases in rainfall from 1961-1990, and
        projections by the Meteorological Research Institute of Japan indicated that this trend
        was expected to worsen. Hydrological and temperature changes in the mountains were
        expected to result in a loss of global biodiversity (―no way up‖ for unique mountain
        species) and also in the loss of the environmental goods and services provided by these
        habitats, especially water supply, basin regulation, and the associated hydropower
        potential. With two thirds of Colombia’s power hydro-generated, any decrease in
        hydropower potential could potentially result in a shift towards thermal power capacity,
        with consequent increases in greenhouse gas emissions.

       Sea level and sea surface temperatures were expected to affect insular areas of the
        country. Several studies by global scholars as well as in the National University of
        Colombia had analyzed the possible impacts of a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO2)
        emissions between the years 2050 and 2080, and found significant potential impacts on
        sea level, sea surface temperatures in comparison to the averages for the period 1961 to
        1990 and ocean acidity. Sea level rises would likely cause saline intrusion into aquifer-
        based freshwater supplies in insular and coastal areas, affecting freshwater systems and
        their biodiversity.      Possible small island impacts identified major population
        displacement as one of the main threats of climate change. In San Andres Island, for
        example, the NC1 estimated a loss of 17 percent of land area, including most of the
        coastal zone, by 2060. Small islands with dense populations and lack of interior land on
        which to relocate coastal communities were expected to suffer socially destabilizing
        impacts. Finally, the subsidence of reefs and atolls in the western Caribbean were seen to
        have potential implications on sovereignty of the oceanic area under domain. Increases
        in sea surface temperatures had been linked to the bleaching of corals in the Caribbean
        and were expected to induce a pole-ward shift of local fisheries. Higher sea surface
        temperatures were already threatening the viability of corals in the western Caribbean,
        much of it located in the Colombian territorial sea that constituted the nursery of an
        estimated 65 percent of fish species in the area. Coral beds in the western Caribbean, in
        particular at remote atolls and reefs were seen as unique, including endemic species of


                                                 1
        global biodiversity value. Coral losses were expected to result in a loss of biodiversity,
        an increase of vulnerability of coastal areas and serious threat to food security of island
        populations.

       Climate change could cause increased exposure to tropical vector diseases. The two
        mosquito-borne diseases with the largest global impact on human health and well-being,
        dengue and malaria, had recently reemerged as significant public health burdens in
        Colombia. The incidence of malaria, during epidemic years, had increased from 1.5 per
        1,000 inhabitants in 1964 to 18.0 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1998. Colombia had its first
        case of dengue hemorrhagic fever in 1989, and there was a clear increasing trend in
        transmission, with a four-fold increase from 1997 to 2002 when over 80,000 persons
        were affected with dengue. Almost half of Colombia’s population of over 20 million
        lived in areas where the mean temperature was well within the range of dengue and
        malaria vectors. It is clearly important to understand the determinants of the incidence
        and severity of these diseases. Some models suggested at that time that an increase of two
        degrees Celsius within these areas was expected to result in an increase in the exposure to
        both diseases. Further, climate change was expected to significantly increase epidemics
        in temperate climates, including mountain areas, which had not previously experienced
        transmission. The implications for an already stressed health sector were considered
        serious.

Adaptation to these three climate related risks formed the focal themes of the Project.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project development objective was to support Colombia's efforts to define and implement
specific pilot adaptation measures and policy options to meet the anticipated impacts from
climate change. Information gathering was a priority since so little was known at that time about
what would happen and how to adapt. The efforts would be focused on high mountain ecosystems,
insular areas, coastal risks and on human health concerns related to the expansion of areas for
vectors linked to malaria and dengue, as identified in the National Communications and other
studies.

The Project’s Key Indicators included the following:

       Availability of continuous and reliable climate information of relevance to major climate
        change vulnerabilities in health, mountain ecosystems and insular areas (157 climate
        stations modernized), through data and analysis provided routinely by IDEAM.
       Six pilot adaptation activities have been implemented and monitored, addressing
        vulnerabilities to climate change in high mountain ecosystems, insular and coastal areas
        and health, including:
              Maintenance of the hydropower generation ability, measured through sustained
                 water regulation of the Las Hermosas Massif on the Amoya River watershed;
              Adaptation program designed and incorporated in regional development plans for
                 the Las Hermosas Massif; positive impacts on biodiversity and land degradation
                 documented;
              Adaptation program designed and incorporated in regional development plans for
                 the Colombian Caribbean insular areas including increased management
                 performance of key marine ecosystems and reduced vulnerability in water supply
                 to local communities; and




                                                 2
              Strengthened public health program incorporating management measures to meet
               the increased threats from dengue and malaria induced by climate change
               resulting in a 30 percent reduction of malaria and dengue morbidity within the
               pilot areas by project completion.

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The GEO and the PDO were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The Project Appraisal Document did not identify its main beneficiaries specifically. By
extrapolating from and summarizing the information presented in the PAD, using the Project’s
GEO and PDO and the specific activities it financed, its main beneficiaries could be expected to
include: (a) the global environment that would benefit from activities aimed at preventing
degradation of global commons (e.g., to conserve globally important biodiversity in marine
ecosystems, protect biodiversity, prevent land degradation and conserve environmental services
in a highly diverse mountain biotope); (b) the government and academic institutions, both those
that would benefit from both improved capacity to produce and disseminate climate information
and those that would benefit from availability of timely climate information to guide the design of
projects, resource allocation, research and operational decision making; (c) the population living
in pilot project areas that would receive social benefits from an increased adaptive capacity of
ecosystems in those areas; (d) the population living in pilot municipalities where the Integrated
Dengue and Malaria Surveillance and Control System (IDMSCS) would be implemented who
might be able to respond to the information1; and (e) other countries around the world that would
be expected to benefit from early learning on climate change adaptation programs.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The total project cost was estimated to be US$15.0 million, of which US$5.4 million was to be
financed under the GEF SPA Grant. The Project included five components, as follows:

Component (A): Making climate, climate variability, and climate change information
available for adoption of adaptation measures and policies
(Total Cost US$3.1 million; GEF funding US$1.0 million)

This component, implemented by IDEAM, sought to strengthen Colombia’s capabilities to
produce and disseminate climate information, in support of adaptation to climate change
measures and programs. The component would strengthen IDEAM’s capabilities to provide: (i)
forecasts to improve resource management and biodiversity conservation decisions in high
mountain ecosystems; (ii) climate scenarios to develop ecosystem management plans, land
conservation and adaptation options in Páramo, insular and coastal areas; and (iii) warnings for
malaria and dengue and possibly how the disease might migrate. The following activities were to
be supported: (i) improvements in technical and scientific capabilities at IDEAM to produce

  The PAD mentions that the Project was expected to reduce malaria and dengue incidence by 30 percent
within pilot areas. This expectation was later curtailed when it became clear that it would not be possible
to achieve this impact with only the activities included under the Project.



                                                    3
information relevant to climate change; (ii) development of local climate change scenarios in
support of selection of adaptation measures; (iii) strengthening the existing climate data network
of relevance to climate change by supporting equipment renovation of 157 key climate stations
(out of 3100 operated by IDEAM) with at least 20 years of high quality data (for 1961 to 1990),
including quality control and assurance; and (iv) strengthening scientific and technical personnel
to ensure long term sustainability of the project activities.

Component (B): Design and implementation of an adaptation program that supports
maintenance of environmental service (including hydropower potential) in the Las
Hermosas Massif in the central range of the Andes
(Total Cost US$3.47 million; GEF funding US$1.57 million)

The Massif is the most humid high altitude moorland in the planet. Hence, it is considered a
highly diverse biotope of particular concern for climate change impacts. It is also important for
potential hydropower generation. The selection of Massif was made on the basis of the
significant biodiversity in the ecosystem, including endangered or threatened species. The
selection of Las Hermosas would provide synergies between the Project and the Amoya River
Project, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector. This
component, implemented by IDEAM, was to support the following activities: (i) ecosystem
planning and management in Las Hermosas Massif, to maintain its high biodiversity assets; (ii)
maintenance of potential for hydropower generation through adoption of measures to protect the
Amoya watershed; (iii) adaptive land-use planning model that sought to reduce impacts from
climate change on land degradation; (iv) improvement of productive agro-ecosystems and
reduction of their socioeconomic vulnerability to climate change impacts. The Project sought to
maintain the existing level of access to environmental services.

Component (C): Adaptation measures in Caribbean Insular areas
(Total Cost US$2.9 million; GEF funding US$1.3 million)

The objective of this component, implemented by the Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas y
Costeras (INVEMAR) and the Corporación para el Desarrollo Sostenible del Archipiélago de San
Andrés, Old Providence y Santa Catalina (Coralina), was to support the implementation of
physical adaptation measures in order to reduce the vulnerability of the Caribbean Insular area,
especially with regard to changes in rainfall, temperature and sea-level rise. The activities under
the component were to include: (i) implementation of Global Ocean Observatory System-based
monitoring stations in the Western Caribbean (complementing the regional network under
CPACC); (ii) integrated water resources management to enhance the availability of fresh water in
the Caribbean Insular areas (San Andrés Island); (iii) implementation of the marine-protected
areas system in the Seaflower Reserve and the Corales del Rosario, San Bernardo e Isla Fuerte
(CRSBeIF) to improve the climate resilience of the habitat; and (iv) select aspects of Integrated
Coastal Management to reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems, infrastructure and populations
living near the coast.

Component (D): Responses to the increased exposure to tropical vector-borne diseases
(malaria and dengue) induced by climate change
(Total Cost US$4.7 million; GEF funding US$1.0 million)

The objective of this component, implemented by the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS), was to
address the increased exposure to tropical vector-borne diseases (malaria and dengue) induced by
climate change through the implementation of an Integrated Dengue and Malaria Surveillance
and Control System (IDMSCS), including an Early Warning System for Malaria and Dengue


                                                4
Surveillance and Control (DMEWS). The Project was ambitious and sought a 30 percent
reduction in both malaria and dengue morbidities in pilot areas as a result of improvements in
health management and prevention of additional exposure caused by climate change. Under the
Project, the IDMSCS was to be implemented in approximately 12 pilot municipalities for both
malaria and dengue, selected on the basis of perceived climate threats. The Project was to
support the design, implementation and operation of the IDMSCS by developing a framework
that permits the continuous evaluation of the local risks of dengue and malaria transmission and
the determination of actions to prevent epidemics before they began. The Project sought to
contribute to the strengthening of the institutional capabilities through the evaluation and
strengthening of local (municipal) health agencies and through the National Health Surveillance
System. The Project aimed to change the existing reactive institutional organization into a
proactive public health system for addressing malaria and dengue.

Component (E): Project Management
(Total Cost US$0.73 million; GEF funding US$0.53 million)

This component, implemented by IDEAM and Conservation International Colombia (CI-
Colombia)2, was to support the overall technical coordination of the Project’s activities (including
the implementation of a technical monitoring system), as well as the administrative and financial
management of the Project. It was to include goods, consultants’ services, travel and operational
and incremental costs of the Project, including staffing (the Project Coordinator, a Procurement
Specialist and others, and the Project’s external audits).

1.6 Revised Components

The Project’s components were not revised. However, the location of the activities under
Component B, were not implemented in Las Hermosas Massif, as originally planned, but in the
Chingaza Páramo and the National Natural Park Los Nevados due to security concerns. This
modification was provided through a project restructuring approved by the Board on May 11,
2010.

1.7 Other significant changes

The May 2010 project restructuring also triggered two additional safeguard policies: Indigenous
Peoples (OP 4.10) and Pest Management (OP 4.09). The Indigenous Peoples policy was
triggered when the Bank learned that the Government had started a process to include as
beneficiaries of the health activities under Component D an Indigenous group of the Guayaberos,
located in San José del Guaviare. This group represented a new and previously uncontemplated
beneficiary of the activities under this Component. The Pest Management policy was triggered
proactively and conservatively even though the Project under Component D did not contemplate
either any increase in the use or purchase and use of pesticides since activities under the Project
were limited to the implementation of early warning systems and improved surveillance and
control of vector borne diseases, as opposed to implementation of activities to mitigate eventual

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Project Appraisal Document reports that the Project was among the first submitted to the
GEF Council under the Strategic Priority on Adaptation (SPA). The SPA was established by
GEF in 2004, in response to UNFCCC guidance, as a $50 million allocation inside of the GEF
Trust Funds. The SPA was a groundbreaking initiative designed to support pilot and
demonstration projects that were expected to provide real benefits and could be integrated into
national policies and sustainable development planning.

Pioneering Project. INAP was a pioneering adaptation project and without the benefit of much
experience, it needed to be designed as a series of pilots in an effort to ―road-test‖ different
approaches across different landscapes. Colombia was seen as an appropriate choice for several
reasons. First, the country had played a leading role in the region and worldwide in the field of
climate change. It was also considered a fitting choice given the well-documented vulnerability
and potentially large impacts that climate change would impose on the country’s development
prospects and process. Impacts were anticipated to have significant and long-term effects on
fragile and unique ecosystems, accelerate the pace of land degradation, contribute to the
impoverishment of biodiversity of species of global importance, increase the exposure of
Colombians to tropical vector diseases, and generally affect the quality of life for its citizens.
Also environmental institutions in Colombia are stronger than in many other countries especially
outside LAC and the country’s environmental agencies are staffed with cadres of well trained
scientists.

Preparation did not benefit from the vast learning that has now resulted from adaptation to
climate change projects financed by the Bank and others worldwide since the Project was
approved. Still, it was path breaking in securing rapid approval for a program of activities that
responded to the adaptation priorities and concerns that the Government had identified in NC1
and in the preparation of NC2. These included the need for information on climate, climate
variability and climate change that would provide policy makers with timely information needed
to reduce the country’s vulnerability, including through the adoption of adaptation measures. The
Project’s cutting-edge nature included at that time the diversity of the different ecosystems in
which it supported pilot projects, and some of the activities pioneered with potential multiple
applications in the region. But as with any adaptation project, success can only be judged ex-post
– after climate impacts have occurred and hence appropriate measures of success remained
elusive in this early effort.

Rationale for Involvement. The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy dated December 24, 2002
included as a strategic focus the protection and conservation of strategic ecosystems, increasing
their adaptive capacity with regard to global climate change impacts. The Project also responded
to the guidelines of the SPA, which required the establishment of ―pilot or demonstration projects
to show how adaptation planning and assessment can be practically translated into national policy
and sustainable development planning‖. The Bank’s extensive previous involvement in
supporting Colombia in its efforts to ensure environmental management and climate change
mitigation made support for jump-starting adaptation efforts, as included under the Project, the
next logical step in a successful program of assistance.

Lessons of Experience. Project design incorporated lessons learned from the Bank’s work on
environmental issues in Colombia, mostly related to environmental management and climate



                                                6
change mitigation initiatives. It was expected to benefit from the capacity of environmental
institutions that had been strengthened under earlier projects, and through the Steering Committee,
sought to complement the activities under those initiatives by mainstreaming the climate change
challenge into the decision making processes of participating agencies. While there had been
very limited experience with adaptation programs when the Project was prepared, its design
benefited from experience in the implementation of some of the earliest adaptation programs in
the Caribbean. That experience highlighted the paucity of information, the need to ensure
sustainability and local ownership of monitoring and data collection, and for reliable methods to
secure and compile data collected. Climate data collection was seen as a long-term activity that
demanded long term commitments. Also, the experience in the Caribbean had illustrated that
years of continuous work would be required to establish the basis for successful adaptation
programs. It was clear this was in fact the first tentative step in a long haul process for which
long-term commitments would be needed to meet growing adaptation to climate change
challenges.

Project Design. With few models from which to learn, the preparation team considered different
project design alternatives. One model considered would involve a project focused on
institutional strengthening and building enabling environments. Experience suggests capacity
building without actual projects to anchor new learning are seldom effective. The other model
would involve addressing only one adaptation measure, in one geographic area and implemented
by one single institution. The team made a conscious decision to proceed with a multi-faceted
focus as expressed in NC1. This involved engagement in different vulnerable geographies (coasts
and mountains) as well as across sectors (health, agriculture, water). It also highlighted what has
now become a common challenge in adaptation projects – the need for cross-sectoral activities
and coordination.

The Project’s Results Framework was designed to respond to the factors described above: the
limited lessons and experience from adaptation projects, the Government’s expressed interest in
adopting a multi-faceted approach aimed at improving climate change monitoring and
implementing pilot approaches in different ecosystems, and the Bank’s and Government’s
determination to act quickly and seize the opportunity offered by the SPA. The Project’s
Development Objectives and the Key Indicators selected to measure progress towards them were
defined cautiously mostly as outputs. While today this Results Framework may appear under-
ambitious, in retrospect, it was judged reasonable at preparation given the absence of experience
in the design and implementation of adaptation projects at the time. The Project counted on very
limited funding, and it was clear from the outset that sustainability of pilot investments, which by
definition are gradual and long-term in nature, would require continued funding beyond that
available under the Grant. The Project was not designed to be a research project, comparing the
results of activities in pilot areas against a base case, nor was it designed to result in a measurable,
increased capacity of pilot areas to adapt to climate change during its short implementation period.
It was designed to jump-start a Government effort and a process to internalize climate change
adaptation in Government policy, based on continuous efforts that would utilize improved
information and data and the experience gained in the implementation of diverse pilot activities
under the Project. This would allow for a learning process in climate change and adaptation
issues that would ultimately strengthen institutional capacity. As a result, the Key Indicators by
which the Project’s achievement of its Development Objectives were to be judged were basically
output, as opposed to outcome or intermediate outcome indicators.

Stakeholder and Partner Involvement. During preparation, local institutions worked closely in
developing the pilot adaptation measures under the pilots, and stakeholders were consulted. The
Project took into account community perceptions to social well-being and threats to their


                                                  7
economic development. Pilots were selected with consideration to community participation in
implementation and, in some cases, on potential for beneficiary co-financing. Partnership
arrangements (Section 2.2), which were in place at the time of preparation and throughout
implementation, served to provide a constant source of advice from renowned international and
national institutions.

2.2 Implementation

The US$5.4 million grant for the Project was approved, signed and declared effective on July 13,
2006. A Mid-Term Review was held, as scheduled, on June 23-27, 2009 to evaluate progress
achieved in the Project’s implementation3. The Grant closed as scheduled (without extension) on
December 31, 2011. The Project’s Implementation Status and Results Reports rated its
implementation performance as Satisfactory throughout implementation. The following factors,
described below, impacted its implementation and initial design: Government commitment,
implementation arrangements, the security situation in Colombia, and a Quality of Lending
Portfolio Review.

Government Commitment. Throughout implementation, the Government at the highest levels
confirmed ownership and leadership of the Project. It became the Government’s flagship
adaptation program, and its implementation experience and findings were internalized to inform
national efforts at formulating adaptation policy. The Government routinely highlighted the
Project in high-level seminars and discussions on climate change, where the challenges of climate
impacts were presented and discussed in an effort to support a process of internalizing climate
concerns in sector policies. The Project’s design and implementation guided the development of
the CONPES note on climate change in its section on adaptation, and was the backbone of
Colombia’s Second National Communication to the UNFCCC (NC2). The Project’s results are
now being used routinely in the development of Colombia’s national sector policies, some
examples include: the National Development Plan 2010-2014 (Act 1450 of 2011), Policy for
Integrated Water Resources (2010), the National Strategy for the Coordination of Policies and
Actions in the Field of Climate Change - National Council Document on Economic and Social
Policy (CONPES 3700-2011) and the National Public Health Plan. In addition, on a Regional and
Local level, measures for adaptation to climate change have been incorporated in the management
and formulation of Development and land management Plans in many municipalities. The results
have also been incorporated in the IPCC most recent Assessment and the approach to glacier
monitoring has been shared in exchanges with other developing countries (notably Nepal at a
SAR climate change conference and an exchange and throughout Latin America).

Implementation Arrangements. The Project’s implementation arrangements were complex, but
necessarily so, given the cross-sectoral nature of adaptation. They comprised four executing
agencies (IDEAM, INVEMAR, Coralina and INS), and an agency that was charged with
managing the Project’s administrative and financial management processes (CI-Colombia).
Executing agencies implemented activities under their respective components with the support of
national, regional and local government entities (Ministry of Social Protection, Ministry of
Agriculture, National Park Unit, autonomous regional authorities, state and municipal health
authorities), local and regional organizations (CI-Colombia, other NGOs, universities and
associations), and beneficiaries of pilot activities. A Steering Committee constituted by



3
    The PAD stated that the MTR would be carried out no later than June 30, 2009.



                                                      8
representatives of the Ministries of Environment, Social Protection and Energy, of the Executing
Agencies and other public entities, approved the Project’s Annual Operating Plans, provided
guidance on implementation, and aimed to ensure the achievement of its objectives in a
coordinated manner. Partnership arrangements with international and local institutions were
secured to provide Executing Agencies with best-practice guidance and assistance in
implementation of activities for which they were responsible4.

While obviously complex, any simplification or streamlining of these arrangements for purposes
of the Project would invariably have detracted from the Project’s impact on the Government’s
ability to internalize adaptation to climate change in its development programs. The Steering
Committee served to elevate the Project’s programs and experience, thereby providing a platform,
which the Government used, for expanding its benefits beyond the few pilot and other activities it
financed to impact sector policies and programs.

Project Restructuring. A delicate public security situation made it impossible for any of the
Project’s key partners to work in the area of Las Hermosas (Component B). The situation of
social unease was expected to prevail throughout the implementation period. As a result, the
Government and Bank teams identified alternative project sites with similar ecosystems (high
mountain moorlands of high importance for water regulation and rich in biodiversity) that would
address security concerns and provide geographic conditions that were technically suitable for
project purposes. Both Chingaza Massif Páramo and the National Natural Park of Los Nevados
met these criteria, and were substituted for the pilot activities in Las Hermosas through a project
restructuring (Section 1.6). On-the-ground activities and interventions would be carried out in
Chingaza Páramo, while only modeling efforts would be developed in Los Nevados. The
Chingaza Páramo was considered a very important strategic area. Within its environmental
services, it supplied fresh water to almost 20 percent of Colombians, principally in Bogotá.
Given its key importance to the country, a significant number of public and private institutions
were implementing activities in the area that would be complimentary to the adaptation measures
to be supported under the Project. The Parque Nacional de Los Nevados is a protected area, in
which many scientific studies had been conducted, facilitating the access to data and resources.
The Las Hermosas Massif site was still expected to benefit from the Project since the guidelines
to incorporate global climate change issues on land use planning that would be developed for the
Chingaza Páramos, as well as the experience to be obtained from the implementation of the
adaptation measures in the new pilot, were expected to be directly applicable to Las Hermosas
and would eventually be used as an input for the development of the Hermosas Massif
management plans. The project restructuring also triggered two additional safeguard policies
(Section 1.7).

  Partnership arrangements were secured with the Meterorological Research Institute (MRI) of Japan, to
provide support to IDEAM under Component A, specifically to provide data from the Earth Simulator for
use in the development of local climate scenarios and selection of adaptation measures, training and
scientific exchanges; the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction (IRI) to provide assistance
in making climate, climate variability and climate change information available for day to day operations in
selected sectors, as well as scientific expertise and training; the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to assist
INS under Component D by sharing information on experiences and data scientific exchanges; with the
National Parks Unit to assist with the monitoring of the Sea Flower Marine Reserve, supporting on site
vigilance and data collection; the Netherlands Climate Change Program (NCAP) to assist INVEMAR in
conducting pilot projects of adaptation measures to sea level rise in coastal areas; and the Universidad
Nacional de Colombia, as IDEAM’s main scientific partner, participating in training, technical capacity
building and leading the definition of climate change scenarios.

Quality of Lending Portfolio Review. The project was subject to a Quality Assessment of
Lending Portfolio Review (QALP) in 2008. The preliminary assessment by QALP expressed
anxiety over the complex nature of the Project and the Bank’s supervision team provided a
detailed response highlighting many factual errors in and disagreements with the review’s
findings. The main areas of difference concerned the design of the Project’s results framework
and arrangements for monitoring, the role of the Government and its ownership of the Project, the
fact that the Project was processed under the SPA and was not a traditional investment project 5,
and mechanisms for supervision and incorporating best practice. The Bank’s supervision team
felt that the QALP review team had not understood the context in which the project was designed
and its focus, specifically the definition of its PDO. It clarified that the Project’s PDO was to be
measured by the definition and implementation at the end of the Project of these pilot adaptation
measures and that the Project was not concerned with producing outcomes related to climate
mitigation or to changed environmental conditions as implied by QALP. QALP’s final
assessment assigned a rating of ―3‖ (i.e., Moderately Likely) for Likelihood of Achieving DOs,
provided several suggestions on how to improve the Project and commented ―The team is to be
congratulated on assisting Colombia in designing and implementing an innovative and pioneering
operation – the first of its kind to support national efforts to adapt to climate change. This is
likely to be a very important area of international assistance for the global community for the
coming decades. A ―learning by doing‖ approach is quite appropriate at this early stage, though it
will be important to use evaluations like this QALP and the upcoming MTR to review earlier
decisions, question assumptions and find more efficient solutions, where needed‖.

A key concern was the disparate and seemingly unrelated project components. It is arguable that
it is not essential, even if desirable, to integrate all elements of a project. After all adaptation
responses on the coast have little to do with those needed to respond to climate change in
páramos. Nevertheless, despite differences of opinion, the Project’s Implementation Status and
Results Reports highlight that the Bank’s supervision team benefited from the QALP review and
addressed some important findings. A panel of external peer review experts was established, and
served to provide guidance on implementation. While the panel did not have specific funding
allocations, three experts selected to provide input on Components A, B and C voluntarily read
output documents, and provided comments in an informal manner. A scientific panel was put in
place to provide input on the technical concept for Component D. All of these experts were
invited to meetings of the Steering Committee. IDEAM also counted on expert input when it
presented the Project’s results at the First National Climate Change Congress where the academy
and scientists were present and discussed the main findings for each of the Project’s components.
The team reviewed and calibrated the Project’s PDO Indicators, especially the indicator related to
the design and implementation of the Integrated Malaria and Dengue Surveillance and Control
System, to more adequately reflect the Project’s pilot nature and short implementation period
(although this change was not reflected in a project restructuring). A dedicated program was

 The supervision team’s response highlighted that: ―…..the project was funded through the SPA. The
SPA was created by the UNFCCC to be managed by the GEF with the specific purpose of ―establishing
pilot or demonstration projects to show how adaptation planning….can be practically translated into
projects that will provide real benefits‖ (SPA Guidelines, GEF Council Document C.27, October 2005).
Although for archiving purposes the project is a SIL, it is not a conventional investment loan.‖




                                                10
developed and used by IDEAM as a project control and monitoring tool. Finally a health expert
was incorporated in the Bank’s supervision team.

The project was also scrutinized by an IEG policy review team that submitted a draft report that
has been commented upon by the Government of Colombia. At the time of writing there is no
further information about this review.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Monitoring activities included not only those to monitor the Project’s progress, but also, perhaps
more importantly, activities under all of the Project’s components aimed at providing timely and
reliable information aimed at focusing adaptation to climate change. This section describes
project monitoring; other monitoring results are described in Section 3.2 below.

Design. As described in Section 2.1, the Project’s Results Framework included outcome and
monitoring indicators (Section 1.2, Annex 2 and PAD Annex 3) that were basically output
indicators. IDEAM was responsible for the development of the Project’s technical monitoring
and evaluation system, and for submitting annual project progress reports integrating the results
of the monitoring and evaluation activities and setting out measures recommended to ensure the
efficient implementation of the Project. (CI-Colombia was responsible for the Project’s financial
and administrative monitoring reports). IDEAM was to have a functioning monitoring system in
place six months after effectiveness, and CI provided technical advice to IDEAM for this purpose.

Implementation and Utilization. By the time of the MTR, IDEAM had established a web-based
monitoring system for project management. The system allows different executing agencies (and
others) to assess information and include comments and information on progress, thereby making
information on adaptation programs accessible to multiple users that are implementing,
supervising or designing similar activities. It is possible to obtain information on individual
components/sub-components, and view progress by different time periods and percentage
advances by component. It is also a repository of information on implementation: minutes of
meetings, documentation on processes, pictures and other relevant information. The system
automatically produces monthly reports that monitor progress, and that were used to update
progress in the Project’s Implementation Status and Results Reports. Nevertheless, concerns
were highlighted in those ISRs that more quantifiable data would have been useful to monitor
progress on the basis of a clearer indication of quantitative achievements. Also, results, when
they became available were posted on the web page of each executing agency, and available for
downloading. Progress reports were also provided on CI’s web page will all of their annexes.
INVEMAR created a newsletter to inform specific results; IDEAM included all results on their
web page, and Coralina and INS used their web pages for dissemination of man results.
INVEMAR still posts regular newsletters on their website, www.invemar.org.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance. The Project was expected to be entirely positive from an environmental
perspective, particularly by protecting vulnerable ecosystems from the impact of global climate
change. Nevertheless, the Project triggered the Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) safeguard policies. An Environmental Assessment was prepared
during preparation since minor environmental impacts could be expected from some investments
under pilot projects, and an environmental management plan, requiring detailed assessments as
part of the preparation of adaptation measures, was agreed and followed. The May 2010 project
restructuring triggered two additional safeguard policies: Pest Management (OP 4.09) and


                                               11
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) (Section 1.7). An Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) was prepared
in the context of the restructuring. The Project’s Implementation Status and Results Reports
report no issues with compliance with safeguard policies, and records visits by social scientists to
monitor especially implementation of the IPP. The Reports noted only guidance by the social
scientist on how to improve documentation of the participatory processes followed and a
verification of compliance with earlier recommendations.

Fiduciary Compliance. CI-Colombia was responsible for financial management, including
disbursements, and procurement under the Project. CI-Colombia had limited previous experience
with the Bank’s fiduciary requirements, but handled the Project’s fiduciary aspects proficiently.
The PAD noted that other executing agencies could execute their own procurement processes
under CI-Colombia’s supervision, and recommended the hiring of a full-time procurement
consultant, which it did. CI-Colombia experienced some initial difficulties with procurement
staff and procedures, after which a detailed Action Plan was agreed that provided for intensive
procurement review during the following year, assignment of additional full-time procurement
staff, semi-annual auditing, continuous training, and semi-annual ex-post reviews. Subsequent
independent reviews rated procurement processes and management as satisfactory, and no further
issues surfaced. Similarly, the only time financial management surfaced as an issue was in mid-
2009 when a mission agreed upon a corrective action plan to address moderate shortcomings—
recommendations to better record quality control processes. Audits were submitted in a timely
fashion, and contained unqualified opinions. Also to maintain fiscal prudence a buffer was
maintained to guard against exchange rate risk and hence there is a small amount undisbursed at
project closure from this buffer.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase/ and Other Relevant Partners

The GOC has internalized the products, intermediate outcomes, and activities financed by the
Project. Several project-financed activities have already been incorporated under Implementing
Agencies’ routine responsibilities, and will no doubt count on continued financing through the
Government’s normal budgetary channels (e.g., activities under Component A implemented by
IDEAM). Nevertheless, the Government has continuously sought external financing, both for the
technical and financial assistance that it brings, for implementation of specific adaptation
programs in different ecosystems, and for furthering its institutionalization of climate change
adaptation in its institutional framework and programs. The Government has so far been able to
secure steady funding from a variety of sources. Though the Government has expressed a desire
for a follow up project there is no specific Bank operation that will provide continued financial
and technical assistance for the activities the Project put in place. Colombia continues to receive
strong support for its efforts to both mitigate and adapt to climate change from other donors.
Related activities such as a recently approved US$10 million Additional Financing for the
Sustainable Development Investment Project, will support broad improvements to promote
environmental sustainability. The Inter-American Development Bank is providing a strong
program of assistance in support of Colombia’s climate change adaptation efforts. This program
includes a series of policy-based loans in support of a Programa de Reformas de la Gestión del
Riesgo de Desastres y Adaptación al Cambio Climático, and several smaller grants, studies and
agreements for technical cooperation for: Sustainability of Marine Ecosystems in San Andrés
Archipelago (US$3 million grant, ongoing); Adaptation to Climate Impacts in Water Regulation
and Supply Area of Chingaza (US$0.9 million grant, that will provide continuity to activities
financed under Component B of the Project, under preparation); Pacific Coast Sustainable
Development Program (US$40.0 million loan, ongoing, co financed by US$7.0 million from the
Nordic Development Bank and US$10.0 million from the Nordic Investment Fund);
Environmental Conservation Based on Pira-Parana’s Traditional Knowledge (Technical


                                                12
Cooperation, financed by the Finnish Technical Assistance Program); Support to the Institutional
Strengthening of the MAVDT in Climate Change (Technical Cooperation); Support to the
Colombian Adaptation Agenda, through IDEAM (Technical Cooperation); Integrated and
Adaptive Management of Water Resources in Colombia (Technical Cooperation); Design of the
new Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (Technical Cooperation). Several
other donors, including bilateral have also committed to supporting Colombia’s adaptation
agenda. In addition, the GOC recently allocated $29 million to strengthen the hydro
meteorological network and early warning system in the country, based on the successful results
gained from IDEAM. During implementation, the Government began discussing with the Swiss
Government an additional financing in the amount of US$5 million to expand the identified
adaptation measures in high mountain ecosystems given their importance in terms of water
regulation and biodiversity.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Project and its objectives, its design and the implementation arrangements that it put in place
remain relevant to the Government’s, the Bank’s and GEF’s assistance strategies and priorities.

The Government’s NC2 provides greater details on Colombia’s vulnerabilities to climate change
and potential impacts for the period 2011-2040, based on a detailed vulnerability assessment
made possible, in part, by the Project. In Section 5, of its NC2, the Government states: ―Given
the progress that Colombia has made in its environmental and sector policies and regulation, the
actions for adaptation proposed are largely addressed to the strengthening of actions already taken,
but which require consideration of climatic variable in planning and execution‖. NC2 highlights
the Project, among two others, as one of the Government’s initial pilot activities in the area of
adaptation to climate change6. The Project and its outputs and its implementation experience
have also contributed to the Government’s adaptation approach in national, regional and local
programs and projects in several policy documents, including the Plan Nacional de Desarrollo
2010-2014, the Plan de Acción Ambiental 2010-2014, the Política Hídrica Nacional (2010), the
Política Nacional de Cambio Climático, under preparation, among others.

The Project is also consistent with the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for Colombia 2011-
2016, which continues to embrace Colombia’s environmental agenda as central to its assistance
priorities. The second of three strategic priority focuses on promoting sustainable growth with
greater climate change resilience, through improvements in urban development, enhanced disaster
risk management, and improved environmental management. Finally, the Project is consistent
with GEF’s Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change. The goal of GEF’s Adaptation Strategy
in 2010-2014 is to support developing countries to increase resilience to climate change through
both immediate and longer-term adaptation measures in development policies, plans, programs,
project and actions. Among the expected outcomes of GEF’s strategy, the following are
particularly relevant to those of the Project: (a) adaptation objectives and budget allocations


6
  The other projects are: Definition of Vulnerability in the Bio-Geophysical and Socio-Economic Systems
due to a Change in Sea Levels in the Coastal Areas of Colombia, financed by the Dutch Assistance
Program for Studies on Climate Change, and Integration of Ecosystems and Adaptation to Climate Change
in the Colombian Massif, financed by the UNDP and IDEAM.



                                                  13
incorporated in broader development frameworks; (b) risk analysis and vulnerability assessment
incorporated as part of development programs and project planning; (c) adaptation practices
developed and implemented to respond to climate change-induced stresses in development
sectors and vulnerable ecosystems; (d) climate change and variability-induced disaster planning
mechanisms developed and applied; (e) awareness raised and communities involved in disaster
planning, preparedness and prevention; and (f) strengthened institutional adaptive capacity to
implement adaptation measures.

The Project’s design, and its implementation arrangements were at the time of Appraisal and
continue to be highly relevant to the Government. Although it’s scope was wide and complex,
and it may be argued that it contained an excessive number of small components, it responded
and continues to respond to the Government’s stated adaptation priorities and continuing
adaptation challenges, and, most importantly, to the Government’s existing institutional
framework and realities through which it will continue to embrace adaptation in the design and
implementation of development programs. Moreover it helped bring several agencies around the
same table to tackle a common problem.

3.2 Achievement of Project and Global Environmental Objectives

The Project met its Development Objective that was to support Colombia’s efforts to define and
implement specific pilot adaptation measures and policy options to meet the anticipated impacts
to climate change. In several cases, the Project exceeded the targets established for each of the
Key Indicators used to measure progress. The Project also made progress towards its implicit
Global Environmental Objectives7. Although in retrospect those Key Indicators may not have
been the most appropriate (see Section 2.1), they were the indicators defined in the PAD and the
evaluation of achievement of PDOs and GEOs follows progress towards targets for those
indicators presented in the PAD. The Project outputs, by component, are presented in the Annex.
The contribution of these outputs, towards the achievement of the Project and Global
Environmental Objectives are described below.

The Project succeeded in providing continuous, reliable climate information to monitor major
climate change vulnerabilities in health, mountain ecosystems and insular areas. IDEAM’s
capabilities for climate modeling and forecasting, and weather forecasting were upgraded, with
information widely disseminated to interested parties. Weather data and climate change
projections are published as a matter of routine on IDEAM’s website. The information from
IDEAM’s 157 stations produces are currently used to generate forecasts and alerts for the
National System for Disaster Prevention, the Office of the President, and other Governmental
Departments and Municipalities, in charge of power and water generation. In addition, the
detailed scenarios produced by IDEAM on climate change are frequently requested by the
National Planning Department, Ministries research centers such as CIAT, and National

  The PAD did not include explicit Global Environment Objectives. It mentioned that the Project would
include (i) activities within natural resources management context that generate global environmental
benefits, and (ii) adaptation measures that provide other major development benefits (e.g., WEHAB, i.e.
water, energy, health, agriculture, biodiversity). It further stated that project activities aim at preventing
degradation of global commons, and that the health component protects the global commons by addressing
the increase in exposure to tropical vector diseases associated with a warming climate, and therefore
mitigates the social and economic consequences of climate change.

The Project also succeeded in implementing and monitoring multiple pilot activities in a high
mountain ecosystem and in Caribbean insular areas, in incorporating adaptation programs in the
design of land-use plans in two municipalities, and in strengthening performance, monitoring and
protecting of key marine ecosystems. Guidelines on land-use planning in high mountain
ecosystems were prepared. The Project was less successful in incorporating management
measures to meet increased threats from dengue and malaria induced by climate change in the
public health programs, although significant progress was made in identifying the factors that
lead to increases in transmission of malaria and dengue, defining priorities for action, and in
bringing the INS on board to begin merging epidemiological and climate data together for
purposes of early warning of possible outbreaks. Instead of creating a new SIVCMD, the Project
supported a further strengthening of the Government’s Sistema de Vigilancia en Salud Pública
(SIVIGILA) by incorporating climate as a determining factor, both directly and indirectly in the
transmission of malaria and dengue, at the central (INS) and local levels (through the secretarias
locales de salud). The results have been included in regional health plans, which include a
strategy for prevention and control of these diseases.

What the Project’s PDO did not capture, was the positive institutional impact that it would have
in bringing the Government together towards embracing the challenge of climate change by
introducing adaptation as an almost cross-cutting theme across government programs (Section 3.5
(b)). The Project became the Government’s flagship adaptation program and was used to inform
a wider effort at formulating adaptation policy and was highlighted in global forum. The
Project’s preliminary results were the basis of the section on adaptation in the Government’s NC2.
Results and experience obtained in project implementation have been used for the drafting of the
CONPES note on climate change policy, and the Government’s National Development Plan
2010-2014 embraces adaptation as a central theme. In this sense, this first, cross-sectoral and
broad adaptation project went far beyond what were defined as its PDOs. As one example, the
experiences generated from INAP have been incorporated in a current project by the UNDP
entitled: "Strengthening of institutional capacities for integrated risk management in the
Caribbean", which looks to generate similar initiatives.

3.3 Efficiency

The PAD presented a preliminary economic analysis of selected adaptation measures in each
component that was carried out during preparation to illustrate the economic efficiency of the
type of adaptation measures covered by the Project. The analysis assessed direct economic
benefits and costs associated with the adaptation measures applying standard economic
methodology. Through this analysis, the cost-benefit ratio was calculated for each adaptation
measure resulting in higher economic benefits than cost in all cases: 1.93 for measures in the
High Mountain Ecosystems (Component B); 2.44 for measures in the Caribbean Insular Area
(Component C);; and 3.7 for measures under the Health Component (Component D).

During implementation, CI updated this cost-benefit analysis of the various adaptation measures
(by Component) supported by the Project using more reliable data generated based on
implementation experience. This was one of the first cost-benefit analyses of adaptation measures
carried out in the country. The analysis categorized adaptation measures as those that have a
direct impact on the areas affected by climate change, and those that ensure the sustainability of
the former. To estimate the economic benefits of adaptation measures under Components A, B
and C, the analysis estimated the loss in economic benefits expected to result from climate change
in the regions where the pilots were implemented, and the reduction in this loss that could be
expected to result with the implementation of the pilots. These were estimated for agricultural


                                               15
markets, energy, tourism, fisheries, and water supply over the 2011-2050 period for the following
departments in Colombia: Cundinamarca, Bolivar, San Andrés, and Bogotá D.C. The analysis
confirmed the positive impact of the adaptation measures carried out under the Project, in terms
of the net present value of their costs and benefits. Although the results differ by sector and
department, the results vary from 0.5 to 3.4 percent for the period 2010-2050. These updated
results were very similar to those that had been calculated during project preparation.

A similar exercise carried out for estimating the cost-benefit of health-related activities under
Component D. The exercise estimated, by municipality, the number of cases of malaria and
dengue that would be avoided, under various climate change scenarios, and the treatment and
other indirect costs, such as lost productivity, which would be avoided. The results revealed that
the cost-benefit varied by municipality, mostly as a function of the number of cases of malaria
and dengue that could be avoided. A large portion of the costs needed to treat malaria and
dengue in view of climate change, varied greatly in each of the municipalities, but the costs
associated with treating malaria showed significant reductions in some municipalities. On the
basis of the municipal-level findings, the exercise then estimated potential cost-benefit of
implementing health activities at the national level. In the pessimistic climate scenarios (A2), the
costs associated with mitigation of malaria are extremely high given the marked impact of an
increase in precipitation on the number of malaria cases. Under scenario B2, the costs to contain
transmission of malaria and dengue are still significant, but lower ranging from 0.1 to 1.7 percent
of GDP (in 2010), depending on the strain of each disease.

Based on these findings, the analysis then estimated the cost of a national climate change
adaptation strategy focused on ecosystems, analyzing several scenarios in which a portion of the
social costs would be reduced. The general finding is one of positive net benefits, but there are
caveats discussed below that need to be considered in interpreting these results. These exercises
are illuminating but the results should be treated as tentative since the economic analysis of future
outcomes that are uncertain is complex and difficult. Uncertainties abound not only in terms of
the future climate impacts but also the type endogenous adaptation that might occur, as well as
the evolution of the future economy. If there is diversification away from climate sensitive
sectors, then impacts would diminish and vice-versa. In sum these estimates are to be viewed as
contingent upon implicit and explicit future scenarios.

Project costs, by component, are presented in Annex 1. With limited resources, the Project
succeeded in putting in motion a process, that has been embraced by the Government at all levels.
While one could argue that the Project does not have resources to sustain the implementation of
the various individual pilots it put in practice, the use of those resources across diverse activities
and ecosystems served to promote broader recognition of the challenges and urgency for
internalizing climate change in development programs, and to mobilize and secure continued
funding for project-implemented initiatives from diverse sources of funding, including the
Government.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The Project’s Overall Outcome Rating for its Development Objectives is Satisfactory. The
Project continues to be relevant to the Government, to the country, and to the broader
international community, despite the plethora of new adaptation projects that have emerged and
benefited from the pioneers. The Project has largely met its Key Performance Indicators, which
as formulated represented outputs that could be used to inform policy makers or provide models
that could be implemented, adjusted and replicated in similar ecosystems. More importantly, the


                                                 16
Project had an important impact over and above original expectations in that it provided a
catalytic force to inform Government policy on adaptation, on the definition and strengthening of
institutional responsibilities at all levels of Government, and on definition and modeling of
successful working arrangements with external stakeholders and beneficiaries of adaptation
initiatives, on a subject that by definition requires successful, long-term and fluid engagement
among multiple actors. Initial estimates point to positive net benefits, and a leveraging of limited
Grant resources through broader international and Government financial support for the
initiatives the Project implemented. On a broader level, Colombia has shared its experience
under the Project in several fora throughout the region, and elsewhere and the Project helped
reinforce the country’s reputation.

At the time of finalizing this Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR), the
Independent Evaluation Group had prepared a draft assessment of the Project, as part of a broader
review that the group is conducting of climate change adaptation projects financed by the GEF
and the Bank. The findings of the assessment have not been incorporated or cited directly in this
ICR since the assessment has been sent to the Government for comment and the Government has
provided extensive and important comments on its findings. The assessment is still in draft as a
result.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

There were no explicit poverty related objectives though it is anticipated that by reducing
vulnerability the project might have improved resilience of climate sensitive livelihoods where
pilots were undertaken. The pilots in high mountain ecosystems benefited more than 90 families
directly; water supply pilots under Component C benefitted around 230 persons. However, the
Project did not collect data on net assets, income or consumption patterns before and after
interventions, which would provide the most robust evidence of resilience to diverse shocks.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Project’s greatest, perhaps unexpected, impact was institutional in creating a new framework
for embracing adaptation to climate change in Government. (Institutions were strengthened
through the process of implementing the activities for which they were responsible under the
Project, as opposed to through the allocation of technical assistance or other direct funding aimed
at their strengthening.) The Project also provided a new model of working together
synergistically across institutions at all levels, and with stakeholders and beneficiaries. More than
the specific pilots that it financed, it developed a working model for incorporating adaptation as a
central element of sustainable development throughout the country, the implementation of which
is now being financed by other sources (Section 2.5). By promoting this institutional capacity and
testing these working arrangements the pilot activities should not be considered one-off models
that financed only discrete activities in diverse ecosystems, but rather as a process that served as a
catalyst for a new way of embracing adaptation to climate change in Government policies and
programs.

Several factors led to this impact. This was the first strict adaptation to climate change project in
a country that is seen as extremely vulnerable to climate change, with a Government committed
to the need for embracing adaptation. IDEAM, the Government’s interlocutor on topics relating
to climate change, is part of the national government and its relations with other departments and


                                                 17
ministries in Government are fluid. Not only was its capacity to provide critical information
strengthened, but it played a central role in disseminating this information and the Project’s
experience, promoting greater focus to adaptation in projects, in diverse seminars, locally and
abroad, and in government policy documents. It has provided input to NC2 and to the CONPES
document that incorporates experience under the Project. The Project’s Steering Committee that
included representation of ministries not directly implementing activities under the Project was
also influential. IDEAM, INVEMAR and Coralina’s work on pilots, disseminating information
on potential impacts of climate change to and directly engaging beneficiaries in the definition and
implementation of adaptation pilots, has brought about a new consciousness among communities
to the possible threats they face and the need to be proactive. Finally, the INS has embraced
climate change as an important determinant of health surveillance, especially insofar as
transmission of malaria and dengue are concerned. The incorporation of climate data in the
SIGIVILA has been very successful in helping the Government address outbreaks of diseases as a
consequence of the la Niña phenomena in 2010/11.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The Risk to Development Outcome for this Project involves three considerations. The first, is the
risk that the Government will not give continuity to the process that the Project assisted in putting
in place, whereby adaptation has become an integral aspect of the country’s development
programs and projects, and that needed, reliable information provided by responsible Government
agencies (e.g., IDEAM are provided in a timely fashion) will continue to be available as and
when needed. This risk is considered small since the Government is aware of the risks of climate
change. There is also the risk that initial results of processes put in place in the pilot projects
included under the Project, could not be continued due to lack of funding, at least in the short-run.
This risk is greater and high, although to-date continued funding has been made available
(Section 2.5). Finally, there is the risk that individual implementing agencies under the Project,
now that it is completed, may not continue to adopt adaptation as part of their normal work. This
risk is small, especially since climate change concerns have now been fully incorporated in major
policies in climate sensitive sectors such as water and agriculture. The Risk to Development
Outcome is considered Moderate overall.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated Satisfactory. The Bank seized the
opportunity to mobilize a new source of funding (SPA) to respond to a priority (adaptation to
climate change) that had been identified by an engaged client that could provide to the broader


                                                 18
international community needed lessons in the implementation of innovative adaptation projects.
In doing so, the Bank had few, if any, examples to follow with lessons from which to help frame
a pioneering project, and there were very few staff in the Bank—and indeed worldwide--working
on climate change (both mitigation and, especially adaptation), at the time. The Project, as
designed, responded to the clients’ priorities as had been set forth in NC1. The Results
Framework, as designed, was cautious, and limited to what a project that addressed a long-term
challenge could reasonably accomplish in the near term with the exception of the framing of
Component D that ambitiously targeted a 30 percent reduction in Malaria and Dengue Morbidity.
However, in hindsight, when the Project was designed there was little information about the
relationship between climate change and the outbreaks of tropical vectors. The Bank assisted in
bringing consultants and external reviewers whose input was extremely productive in filling the
information void that existed, and incorporating climate change in health monitoring systems.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank’s supervision was timely, proactive and engaged throughout implementation. In all,
during implementation, the Bank mounted ten missions, in which all of the Project’s components
were supervised, including in most cases at the local levels. It addressed the few implementation
issues that arose proactively, in a manner that resulted in their rapid resolution. The Bank’s
Project preparation team was extremely engaged, and anxious to show case the Project, its
implementation and results in international events through seminars and other meetings that it
organized, and to bring representatives from other countries to Colombia to learn about its
experience and implementation first hand. There was undoubtedly Government ownership of the
Project (see Section 5.2 (a) below). The Mid-Term Review, carried out on schedule, was
structured as an opportunity for engagement, and for disseminating and engaging Government
officials not directly involved in project implementation. The Project’s Implementation Status
and Results Reports report that ―early preparation for the MTR has proven very productive as all
task teams are conducting a detailed review of their commitments, resources, execution times,
coordination needs and potential synergies with other groups. During the MTR visit in June 23-
27 2009, meetings with most line ministries (environment, energy, social affairs, agricultures,
finance) are scheduled in order to explore further the synergies of the climate change adaptation
activities supported by the project with sector policies.‖

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall Bank Performance is rated Satisfactory, based on the ratings for Bank Performance for
Ensuring Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government’s Performance is rated Satisfactory. The Government demonstrated unwavering
commitment to the Project, and to adaptation to climate change in general. It internalized the
Project’s outputs and results, and used and applied them eagerly in the preparation of not only
official communications to the UNFCCC, but also in the Government’s policies, procedures and
general modus operandi, as reflected in numerous policy documents, including its National
Development Plan 2010-2014. It promoted two high-level national seminars on climate change;
the focus of the second seminar in September 2011 was on adaptation to climate change. It


                                               19
shared the findings of implementation experience with the broader international community
through seminars, at the COPs, and by disseminating these in official Government
communications.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Implementing Agencies Performance is also rated Satisfactory. IDEAM readily assumed its
role as overall coordinator of project implementation, and showed continued commitment to its
objectives, implementation and dissemination of results, including incorporating its findings in
relevant Government documents. Coralina, INVEMAR and INS carried out their activities in a
timely and quality fashion, realizing that they needed to engage communities in their efforts to
develop a mind-set geared towards viewing climate change as a reality, and adaptation as a
mechanism to address for their sustainable development. CI-Colombia provided consistent,
proficient support for the Project’s administrative and technical processes, addressing the few
emerging issues without hesitation, and as a result provided invaluable support to the Project’s
implementing agencies, that were able to concentrate efforts on implementation and not mostly
administrative management. CI was also proficient in facilitating dialog among agencies and
between the agencies and the Bank, and did an excellent job in coordination and project
management. Finally, the role of the Steering Committee, through consultation with IDEAM
ensure the coordination required (at the highest levels) for this institutionally complex project to
meet its expected outcomes effectively and expeditiously, and for its accomplishments and
institutional strengthening and coordination arrangements to be internalized.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall Borrower Performance is rated Satisfactory based on the ratings for Borrower
Performance and Implementing Agencies Performance.

6. Lessons Learned

The Project was prepared with the benefit of very few lessons, in a rapid manner to respond to the
client’s request. In hindsight, it might have been possible to formulate a more detailed, refined
project, but it is not clear that the delay in preparation that this would have entailed would justify
the more precise definition of components, research studies, and focus. While not necessarily in
the research sense, the project provided on the ground, real life experiences that are of
unquestionable value in the design of new programs. When moving into unknown territory, with
innovative projects, it is probably best to accept taking measured risks and to spread these risks;
hence, the approach of supporting disparate activities in an effort to promote understanding across
a broad adaptation front. The Project’s broad focus, spanning diverse adaptation challenges (as
opposed to focusing on one only) had the benefit of acting as a catalyst for mobilizing multiple
sources of funding for providing continuity to and expansion of the activities it piloted. But of
course this comes at a cost of being too diverse and loss of focus.

The value of including pilot projects, or experiments, in a project that focuses on a new theme,
lies not only in the value of the pilot projects themselves, or their sustainability. The value of
including pilot projects, even if their outcome is not entirely positive, lies in their becoming
catalysts or experiments to test new models of government cooperation, at all levels, with local
organizations and beneficiaries. This type of project can provide a catalytic force in bringing



                                                 20
institutions that would ordinarily not coordinate routinely to work cooperatively on a topic that by
definition requires cross-sectoral cooperation. While the pilots may not always be the best
choices or entirely successful, the fact that their design and implementation require definition of
new approaches and models of engagement among various actors, that can be replicated, adjusted
and perfected with experience, in itself justifies the use of a variety of pilots.

Adaptation is at the center of sustainable development. For adaptation programs to be successful,
information and inputs need to be top-down, bottom-up and sideways. The benefit of this Project,
that incorporated all of these modalities, lie in the experience that it generated for internalizing
adaptation in the Government’s programs at all levels.

Communities that have been made aware of potential consequences of climate change have
become totally receptive to adaptation programs, and have become proactive in changing and
adapting their systems in order to improve their livelihoods and reduce their vulnerabilities.

Communities that perceive that Government institutions address their concerns and suggestions
become motivated and participate in the development and design of projects that produce
sustainable initiatives. For projects to be successful, community involvement from the outset is
important.

By definition, adaptation to climate change is a medium- to long-term commitment. In this sense,
teams should be careful in defining projects’ results framework to avoid including, as indicators
to measure progress, those that represent outcomes (e.g., 30 percent reduction in incidence of
malaria and dengue), for which it would be unreasonable to expect noticeable impact during five
years of project implementation. The ultimate measure is resilience to shocks and this calls for
incorporation of climate-sensitive assets, or income as indicators of immunity to climate shocks
and variations.

Project outputs, by component, were as follows:


Component (A): Making climate, climate variability, and climate change information
available for adoption of adaptation measures and policies

This objective of this component, implemented by IDEAM, was to strengthen Colombia’s
capabilities to produce and disseminate climate information (useful for resource allocation and
operational decision making), in support of adaptation to climate change measures and programs.
This component had four sub-components that would strengthen IDEAM’s capabilities to
provide: (i) forecasts to improve resource management and biodiversity conservation decisions in
high mountain ecosystems; (ii) climate scenarios to develop ecosystem management plans, land
conservation and adaptation options in Páramo, insular and coastal areas; and (iii) warnings for
malaria and dengue. Outputs for each of the sub-components were as follows: (i) improvements
in technical and scientific capabilities at IDEAM to produce information relevant to climate
change; (ii) development of local climate change scenarios in support of selection of adaptation
measures; (iii) strengthening the existing climate data network of relevance to climate change by
supporting equipment renovation of 157 key climate stations (out of 3100 operated by IDEAM)
with at least 20 years of high quality data (for 1961 to 1990), including quality control and
assurance; and (iv) strengthening scientific and technical personnel to ensure long term
sustainability of the project activities.

Component A (i): Improvements in technical and scientific capabilities at IDEAM to produce
information relevant to climate change

Under this subcomponent, IDEAM upgraded its computer facilities by upgrading to high capacity
processers capable of handling climate modeling using CAM (Community Atmosphere Model)
and climate forecasting using WRF (Weather Research and Forecast Model). The improved
capability, offered by these systems, has allowed IDEAM to reduce simulation times from seven
to nine hours to less than one hour. Through partnerships with MRI (Meteorological Institute of
Japan), the Hadley Center (UK) and the Community Climate System Model (US), IDEAM was
able to recreate and record more detailed historic climate change data. Climate change data by
month was compiled for the period 1971-2000 for rain, temperature and relative humidity.

Component A (ii): Development of local climate change scenarios in support of selection of
adaptation measures

Using the improvements under subcomponent A (i), IDEAM produced climate models and made
climate predictions that generated a series of maps at the national level, with several resolutions
and time frames. Using the PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impact Studies) and
ERA40 of the ECMWF (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts), IDEAM
generated 25km/25km models for the 1971-2000 period, and using MRI’s GSM (Global Forecast
System) generated 20km/20km models for the 1979-1998 period, with rain, temperature and
relative humidity data.




                                                29
IDEAM produced six climate change projections under four scenarios at a resolution of 4km/4km
for the period 2011-2100 using the WRF model and the results of the global CAM.9 The results
of this modeling revealed that against an average increase in temperature of 0.13º C/decade from
1971-2000, the average temperature is expected to increase by 1.4º C from 2011-2040, by 2.4º C
from 2041-2070 and by 3.2º C from 2071-2100; these increase would cause reduced rainfall in
large areas of the Caribbean and Andean regions, and increased rainfall in the Pacific region,
together with reduced relative humidity in certain areas of the country.

Using PRECIS, IDEAM also produced models for scenarios A2 and B2, and the produced and
analyzed information for Colombia’s 24 regions with respect to changes in temperature and
precipitation. These models show that for the A2 (pessimistic) scenario, average temperatures
could increase between 2º C and 4º C, in relation to average temperatures between 1961 and 1990.

IDEAM’s climate modeling has produced different scenarios for regional and more localized
areas, all of which are available on its website. Also available are the following studies prepared
to document its findings:

       Evidencias de Cambio Climático en Colombia (2007) that presents the analysis of 1800
        historical series of precipitation, and extreme high and low temperatures from 1970 to
        2008;

        para Colombia usando Modelos Meteorológicos de Alta Resolución (Panorama 2011-
        2100) (2010)

Component A (iii): Strengthening the existing climate data network of relevance to climate
change by supporting equipment renovation of 157 key climate stations (out of 3100 operated
by IDEAM) with at least 20 years of high quality data (for 1961 to 1990), including quality
control and assurance

IDEAM upgraded it climate data network, including 157 climate stations (11 of which are new),
102 higrothermographs, 28 raingauges, 12 heliographs, 12 anemometers and 12 psicrometers, all
of which were integrated in the climate stations. All of the stations have been incorporated in
IDEAM’s network and count on continued maintenance in accordance with the institution’s
maintenance program. This has produced a significant improvement in providing higher
precision, longer forecast periods, and real time weather forecasts.

Component A (iv): Strengthening scientific and technical personnel to ensure long-term
sustainability of the project activities

IDEAM staff, through implementation of the Project that involved partnerships with international
partners (MRI, IRI, and others), had numerous occasions to benefit from their experience and the
assistance they provided as input to the implementation of subcomponent A(i), A(ii) and A(iii).

  These scenarios included A1B, A2, B2, A1B with sulfates, A2 with sulfates and B2 with sulfates. The
scenarios with sulfates consider the presence of aerosols (SO2, SO4) that imply less warming of the land
mass.

In addition, 10 persons obtained their Masters’ Degrees in Meteorology at the Universidad
Nacional de Colombia. Of these, nine have been incorporated at IDEAM assigned to monitoring,
processing information and analysis and interpretation of climate change in Colombia, for work
on different projects.

Component (B): Design and implementation of an adaptation program that supports
maintenance of environmental service (including hydropower potential) in the Las
Hermosas Massif in the central range of the Andes

The objective of this component was to implement, monitor and address vulnerabilities to climate
change in a high mountain ecosystem. Massif is the most humid high altitude moorland in the
planet. Hence, it is considered a highly diverse biotope of particular concern for climate change
impacts. It is also important for potential hydropower generation. The selection of Massif was
made on the basis of the significant biodiversity in the ecosystem, including endangered or
threatened species. The selection of Las Hermosas would provide synergies between the Project
and the Amoya River Project, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power
sector. This component, implemented by IDEAM, was to support the following activities: (i)
ecosystem planning and management in Las Hermosas Massif, to maintain its high biodiversity
assets; (ii) maintenance of potential for hydropower generation through adoption of measures to
protect the Amoya watershed; (iii) adaptive land-use planning model that sought to reduce
impacts from climate change on land degradation; (iv) improvement of productive agro-
ecosystems and reduction of their socioeconomic vulnerability to GCC impacts. The Project
sought to maintain the existing level of access to environmental services. For practical reasons
responding to security concerns in accessing the Las Hermosas area, activities under this
component were implemented in the Chingaza area, following a project restructuring (Section
1.7).

Component B (i): Ecosystem planning and management in Chingaza, to maintain its high
biodiversity assets

IDEAM identified, early on, a need for greater information on and modeling of water and carbon
cycling to understand the potential impacts of climate change in a high mountain ecosystem.
IDEAM established eight watershed monitoring stations to record flows in the Rio Claro basin in
the Parque Nacional Natural los Nevados and in the Chingaza Massif, and eight carbon
monitoring stations in the same areas. The Government of Japan provided support for the
implementation, validation and modeling of this water and carbon cycling.

For water cycling, IDEAM adopted the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool of USDA,
2002), that monitors water storage, streamflows, drainage, etc. The results conclude that flows are
influenced directly by the conditions of the ecosystems in which the rivers are located, which
corroborates the need to conserve and manage high mountain ecosystems to guarantee water
levels. IDEAM also monitored glaciers to determine their potential effect on the hydrological
cycle in high mountain ecosystems. Following work it had begun in 2005, IDEAM established a
monitoring station in the area of the Glaciar Conejeras to research the effects in changes. The
research revealed that in glacial areas there is an inverse relationship between precipitation and an
increase in water levels.

For carbon cycling, IDEAM developed a protocol for monitoring in association with the
International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), on the basis of which it selected locations
for monitoring, determined methodology and analyzed data. Several documents were prepared to
record this initiative, including: (a) Instructivo para el monitoreo e evaluación del ciclo del


                                                 31
carbono en la vegetación y suelos de ecosistemas de alta montaña (IDEAM, 2009); (b)
Caracterización preliminary del ciclo del carbono (IDEAM, 2009); and (c) Metodologia para la
captura de información de carbono en los sistemas productivos ky su integración en el monitoreo
del ciclo ce carbono (IDEAM, 2009). The carbon modeling included the construction of a
database of the information monitored over the three year period, including: species growth,
biomass, decomposition, etc., in each of the sites. Preliminary results show that the greatest
concentrations of carbon are found in densely forested ecosystems, due principally to the slow
and continuous decomposition in those systems.

Component B (ii): Maintenance of potential for hydropower generation through adoption of
measures to protect the Rio Claro watershed10

Under this subcomponent, IDEAM worked with local communities to implement activities aimed
at restoring degraded areas and adopting sustainable production systems. The activities
implemented benefitted about 850 people in different rural communities that were directly
involved, and indirectly about 15,000 people that reside in the river basin. Following a detailed
study to understand land use that included mapping of land cover, that was provided in a detailed
study, Formulación e Implementación de una Estrategia de Restauración Ecológica del Paisaje,
IDEAM prepared a detailed proposal on how to structure this activity: Memoria técnica y
cartográfica y documento de criterios para la formulación del plan de restauración,
conservación y manejo de las coberturas de la tierra. The proposal prioritized different areas for
ecological restoration, based on existing practices and perceived threats. The areas selected
included: (a) páramo areas that have been threatened or lost natural cover due to fires, cattle
raising or agriculture; (b) forest areas not appropriate for agriculture that have been threatened by
fires or other unsuitable practices; (c) forests and river banks that have been threatened by
deforestation; (d) river banks that have lost vegetal cover; (e) forest reserves or national parks that
show signs of deterioration in cover; and (f) areas that have suffered from superficial water
erosion.

IDEAM worked with local communities, involving them through learning sessions aimed at
exchanging ideas and proposals. The communities provided input with respect to plant species
that should be used for restoration and definition and input of traditional their traditional practices,
thereby securing their involvement and commitment. The communities were responsible for 198
individual proposals in areas that were considered of importance to maintain water levels, and for
establishing 24.8 kilometers of living fences. In order to promote sustainability, an experimental
center for germination and propagation of species native to the high mountain ecosystems in the
Andes was constructed.

Component B (iii): Adaptive land-use planning model that sought to reduce impacts from
climate change on land degradation

IDEAM worked with two municipalities, La Calera and Choachi, in adapting their land use plans
in a manner that would reduce the impacts from climate change. Providing technical assistance

     The area was changed to Chingaza and Río Blanco Watershed.




                                                   32
directly to the municipal governments, IDEAM provided training to the Juntas de Acción
Comunal, and other local actors involved in territorial planning. To support this process, IDEAM
defined the Estructura Ecológica Territorial Adaptativa (ETTA), which includes mapping of land
use and productive systems, vulnerability and threats by activities such as mining and fires,
among others. The initiative was prepared at a scale of 1:25,000 which was considered sufficient
for decision-making. The ETTA was used as the principal instrument through which these
municipalities could incorporate climate change and protection of ecosystems in land-use
planning decisions. IDEAM also worked with eight communities in developing Planes de Vida
de Adaptación, a process for disseminating to and involving local communities in adaptation to
climate change through explicit agreements with the communities.


Component B (iv): Improvement of productive agro-ecosystems and reduction of their
socioeconomic vulnerability to GCC impacts

Under this subcomponent, IDEAM promoted agro-forestry systems to build resilience and reduce
vulnerability of high mountain productive systems to the effects of climate change. Following a
detailed analysis of land-use and of the local communities, IDEAM classified different areas
according different environmental, socio-cultural and economic categories, and established four
production systems for the area of the Rio Blanco basin, in Chingaza. Over 200 farms have been
categorized, and 90 productive units have land management plans formulated, based on
sustainable and economically viable activities, benefitting about 280 persons. Several other
activities were implemented including, 74 organic orchards, 10 stables, and other initiatives that
will reduce the socio economic vulnerability of beneficiary families.


Component (C): Adaptation measures in Caribbean Insular areas
(Total Cost US$2.9 million; GEF funding US$1.3 million)

The objective of this component, implemented by the Instituto de Investigaciones Marinas y
Costeras (INVEMAR) and the Corporación para el Desarrollo Sostenible del Archipiélago de San
Andrés, Old Providence y Santa Catalina (Coralina), was to support the implementation of
physical adaptation measures in order to reduce the vulnerability of the Caribbean Insular area,
especially with regard to changes in rainfall and temperature and sea-level rise. The activities
under the component were to include: (i) implementation of Global Ocean Observing System-
based monitoring stations in the Western Caribbean (complementing the regional network under
CPACC); (ii) integrated water resources management to enhance the availability of fresh water in
the Caribbean Insular areas (San Andrés Island); (iii) implementation of the marine-protected
areas system in the Seaflower Reserve and the Corales del Rosario, San Bernardo e Isla Fuerte
(CRSBeIF) in order to contribute to the conservation of marine ecosystems in the face of climate
impacts; and (iv) Integrated Coastal Management to reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems,
infrastructure and populations living near the coast. The Project sought to maintain resilience of
insular areas to climate impacts.

Component C (i): Implementation of Global Ocean Observing System-based monitoring
stations in the Western Caribbean (complementing the regional network under CPACC)

INVEMAR established two additional water and atmospheric stations near Parque Nacional
Nuestra Senora del Rosario y San Bernardo and in Johnny Cay in San Andrés Island. These
meteooceanographic stations provide data that is stored and analyzed in a central database, CAD
(Centro Administrador de Datos), developed by the Project and established in Santa Marta. Each


                                               33
station provides real time updates of fifteen land and water parameters, via satellite on an hourly
basis. The parameters include: wind velocity and direction, solar radiation, air temperature and
humidity, atmospheric pressure and precipitation, as well as chlorophyll, salinity, conductivity,
free oxygen, pH, TSM, turbidity and water level. The information is automatically connected to a
Caribbean wide database. This subcomponent has also provided capacity strengthening to
INVEMAR in analyzing oceanographic and marine meteorological data through formal and on-
the-job training, and well as on maintenance of equipment at the water and atmospheric stations.
INVEMAR has used the data generated from these and other stations to analyze the effects of
climate change on marine corals.

Component C (ii): Integrated water resources management to enhance the availability of fresh
water in the Caribbean Insular areas (San Andrés Island)

The Project worked with local communities on the island San Andrés in the design and
development of management tools that respond to local conditions, and that will permit regulating
the use of the limited resources to which they have access. This effort was especially important
since it brought attention to these communities regarding the need to put in place measures geared
towards adaptation to climate change. One of the adaptation strategies involves programs
designed to make efficient the use of water (rain and residual). The Project designed pilot
projects in marginal areas of the San Andrés Island where provision of water is an issue. From
among eleven prescreened investments, the Project financed the implementation of three: Ciudad
Paraíso, Tom Hooker and Schooner Bigth where ―integrated water management systems‖ were
constructed. These three systems benefitted around 228 persons (48 families). The infrastructure
involved the construction of canals to capture rainwater, tanks for storage and piping for
distribution; for sewage the systems rely on channeling residual water to a simple treatment
facility. These works were complemented with training for the beneficiaries in operating,
maintaining and monitoring these simple systems, and distribution of water filters.

The Project financed a simulation model of the San Andrés acquifer. The model permits
analyzing the behavior of the acquifer under different climate change scenarios. This is an
important tool for decision-making regarding the management of water resources. As part of this,
the Project financed the construction of nine observation wells, which brought the number of total
piezometers to 32, as part of the management plan of underground water resources.


Component C (iii): Implementation of the marine-protected areas system in the Seaflower
Reserve and the Corales del Rosario, San Bernardo e Isla Fuerte (CRSBeIF) in order to
contribute to the conservation of marine ecosystems in the face of climate impacts

Coralina and INVEMAR established and marked Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in two
locations: Corales del Rosario, San Bernardo e Isla del Fuerte (CRSBeIF) (INVEMAR
implemented) and in the Archipiélago de San Andrés, Providencia y Santa Catalina in the
SEAFLOWER biosphere reserve (Coralina implemented).

In CRSBeIF, INVEMAR implemented a No Take entry strategy, through the physical
demarcation of the area. In the SEAFLOWER reserve, Coralina implemented three No Take
zones and five No Entry zones. For both of these areas, the Project financed control and
protection strategy to enforce the No Take/No Entry areas.

The Project financed a management plan for the Cayo Bolivar and Cayo Albuquerque that
contemplates five strategies: (a) productivity; (b) biodiversity; (c) studies of natural habitats and


                                                 34
responses to natural phenomena; (d) a communication program and (e) administration and
participatory evaluation.

INVEMAR and Coralina also carried out research under this subcomponent, including on: the
tolerance of coral to the increase temperatures and light intensity, research on different coral
species, understanding the connectivity between coral ecosystems in the Caribbean in Colombia
to identify resilient reefs as a climate change adaptation strategy. The results of these research
and findings of the following studies re published in the Climate Change portal and web-page of
INVEMAR. The studies include: Siguiendo la dinámica de los arrecifes coralinos en los mares
colombianos; Resultados del taller sobre monitoreo de arrecifes coralinos en áreas marinas
protegidas; Resultados del primer curso sobre genética de poblaciones y los resúmenes:
“Instrumentos par la formulación e implementación de medidas de adaptación de arrecifes
coralinos ante el cambio climático en el AMP-Corales del Rosario, San Bernardo e Isla Fuerte,
Caribe Colombiano? y “Dinámica de arrecifes coralinos de dos niveles de prodfundidad en
areas marinas protegidas el caribe colombiano: San Andrés, Tayrona, Rosario y San Bernardo?.


Component C (iv): Integrated Coastal Management to reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems,
infrastructure and populations living near the coast

Complementing the water and atmospheric stations under subcomponent (i) above, INVEMAR
strengthened its network that monitors marine biology for the coral ecosystem, by adding three
additional monitoring stations in San Bernardo (Mangie, Ceycen, Minalta and Tiosolda) to the
Sistema Nacional de Monitoreo de Arrecifes Coralinos en Colombia (SIMAC). These will allow
the institution to monitor with greater resolution the health and dynamics of the coral ecosystem
in the Archipiæelago del Rosario, San Bernardo e Isla Fuerte (CRSBeIF). The information
generated by this monitoring has been used to work with local communities, for decision-making
by those responsible for the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and the design and implementation
of strategies that will promote ecosystem adaptation to the effects of climate change. All of the
information generated from this monitoring has been published in bulletins on climate change,
and scientific articles both of which are posted on INVEMAR’s webpage. Studies posted
include: Parámetros Precipitación, salinidad y pH en la estación Tesoro, Los efectos del
huracán Tomas en el nivel del mar, and Respuesta del ambiente marino a algunos eventos
meteorológicos sinópticos medidos sobre los arrecifes de San Andrés y de las islas del Rosario,
Caribe Colombiano. Under the Project, INVEMAR recognized the need to formulate and
implement integrated management plans that promote sensitive ecosystems’ adaptive capacity to
climate change. The management plans for the coral reefs in CRSBeIF respond to a series of
proposed actions defined on the basis of detailed environmental diagnostics, and aimed at
preventing, mitigating, correcting, compensating or adapting to the negative environmental
impacts that climate change causes.

The Project financed a management plan for the Cayo Bolivar and Cayo Albuquerque that
contemplates five strategies: (a) productivity; (b) biodiversity; (c) studies of natural habitats and
responses to natural phenomena; (d) a communication program and (e) administration and
participatory evaluation.

The Project also financed initiatives aimed at improving agriculture and livestock production.
This activity included carrying out a diagnosis of these activities in Providencia, identify priority
areas for action, the carrying out of the first phase of three pilot projects on sustainable
agricultural production, and implementing a demonstrative pig housing study in San Andrés



                                                 35
Island. The purpose of this activity is to address pollution caused by drainage of pig waste and
related odors.

The Project financed the preparation of a document on population policy and the formulation of
an action plan and guidance in response to expected climate changes in the coastal zones. This
policy was prepared with active participation of about 200 people representing local communities
and public and private institutions and organizations, in about 40 workshops.

The Project developed guidelines to incorporate alternatives responsive to climate change in
housing design in potentially affected coastal areas. The housing model proposed, that includes
architectural blueprints and designs--addresses the possibility of alternative energy sources,
recommendations of appropriate building materials, and instruments for land-use planning.

The Project also financed a study of beach and coastal erosion. The study carried out a censes of
coastal infrastructure in Sound Bay, Punta Hansa and Jenny Bay; a diagnostic of erosion on the
west coast of San Andrés Island, a monitoring and training plan for beach monitoring and the
reforestation of the Spratt Bight Beach.

Component (D): Responses to the increased exposure to tropical vector-borne diseases
(malaria and dengue) induced by climate change
(Total Cost US$4.7 million; GEF funding US$1.0 million)

The objective of this component, implemented by the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS), was to
address the increase exposure to tropical vector-borne diseases (malaria and dengue) induced by
climate change through the implementation of an Integrated Dengue and Malaria Surveillance
and Control System (IDMSCS), including an Early Warning System for Malaria and Dengue
Surveillance and Control (DMEWS). The Project sought a 30 percent reduction in both malaria
and dengue morbidities in pilot areas as a result of improvements in health management and
prevention of additional exposure caused by climate change. Under the Project, the IDMSCS was
to be implemented in approximately 12 pilot municipalities for both malaria and dengue, selected
on the basis of perceived climate threats. The Project was to support the design, implementation
and operation of the IDMSCS by developing a framework that permits the continuous evaluation
of the local risk of dengue and malaria transmission in the face of GCC and the determination of
the most appropriated actions to prevent epidemics before they began. The Project sought to
contribute to the strengthening of the institutional capabilities through the evaluation and
strengthening of local (municipal) health agencies and through the strengthening the National
Health Surveillance System. The Project aimed to change the existing reactive institutional
organization into a proactive public health system for addressing malaria and dengue.

The design of the IDMSCS took into consideration health determinants such as climatic variables,
demographics and socio-economic indicators. The Project financed an epidemiological analysis
of transmission of malaria and dengue in six pilot areas of four municipalities.11

The findings found that four factors determine the geographic impact of climate change on
dengue: (a) lack of security in access to water (that lead people to store water); (b) population



11
  For malaria, the municipalities were Montelibano, Puertilibertador, Buenaventura, and San José del
Guaviare. For dengue, the municipalities were Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Floridablanca and Armenia.



                                                36
density and movements (higher incidence in areas with greater population and movements); (c)
size of housing and rainfall (smaller housing results in greater incidence and less seasonal
variations); and (d) variations in altitude and temperature (temperature and altitude at certain
ranges promotes the growth of larvae). Based on these findings, the Project prepared a action
plan for prioritizing the Government’s efforts, including those of the municipal governments that
are responsible for prevention program, to guide its efforts to reduce the incidence of dengue.

The findings resulted in the following for malaria: (a) the effects of rainfall and temperature on
the transmission of malaria vary depending on the geographic location of the municipality, and do
not offer generalizations that apply to the entire country; (b) it is necessary to improve the quality
control of diagnostic instruments in order to ensure that the reality in the field is reflected in
diagnostic reporting; (c) entomological surveillance should focus mainly on factors that will
produce reliable information for decision making and planning, including a reliable assessment of
the presence or lack thereof of vectors and their resistance to insecticides; and (d) the projections
of malaria cases were carried out on the basis of short-, medium- and long-term forecasts of
temperature and precipitation. In the medium-term, the model forecast an increase of 6 to 15
malaria cases per thousand population assuming similar socioeconomic and entomological factors
as is the base case.

The Project financed the development of an early warning system, DMEWS, based on nine
platforms that permit continuous simulation of transmission dynamics based on epidemiological
and climatic information. This system was designed to eventually be monitored by health
authorities at the central, departmental and local levels. Epidemiological information is provided
by the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS), and climatic information by IDEAM on a daily basis.

Component (E): Project Management
(Total Cost US$0.73 million; GEF funding US$0.53 million)

This component, implemented by IDEAM and Conservation International Colombia (CI-
Colombia)12, supported the overall technical coordination of the Project’s activities (including the
implementation of a technical monitoring system), as well as the administrative and financial
management of the Project. It financed goods, consultants’ services, travel and operational and
incremental costs of the Project, including staffing (the Project Coordinator, a Procurement
Specialist and others, and the Project’s external audits).

  CI-Colombia is a recognized NGO with broad environmental experience in high mountains and insular
ecosystems. CI-Colombia did not implement the Project, per se, but rather acted as a coordinator for its
required administrative and financial management processes.
