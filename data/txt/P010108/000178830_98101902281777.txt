REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A SECOND WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for the equivalent of US$8.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for improving and
extending water supply and sewerage facilities in Kathmandu, Kathmandu Valley,
Pokhara, Biratnagar, and Birganj. The proceeds of the credit would be relent
to the Water Supply and Sewerage Board (WSSB) with interest at 9% per annum
for a term of 25 years, including a five-year grace period on the payment of
principal and interest.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Review of the Economic
Situation of Nepal" (Report No. 1180-NEP) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on July 30, 1976. The principal findings of the report and the
developments since then are described below. Country data are shown in
Annex I.
3.        Nepal has been classified by the United Nations as one of the
least-developed countries in the world. Its per capita income in 1975 was
estimated at $110. It has a population of 12.6 million, estimated to be
growing at around 2% per year. A large proportion, nearly 96% of the popula-
tion, live in rural areas. Health and education facilities are below the
standards achieved in the rest of South Asia. Nepal has an infant mortality
rate of 200 per thousand live births, an adult literacy rate of 14%, and a
life expectancy at birth under 45 years.
4.        The country has a difficult topography which severely limits the
area of arable land. Yet population density is now 450 per square kilometer
of land for all of Nepal and 930 persons in the Hill areas where 59% of the
people live. Already the results of pushing the area of cultivated land
beyond economically feasible and ecologically safe limits are being felt
in the Hill areas. Agricultural yields have declined, and soil erosion and
landslides have resulted in these areas.   In the Terai plains where foodgrains,
sugar and jute are cultivated, little room is left for extending the cultivated
areas. The traditional grain surpluses produced in the Terai are declining as
population has grown.
5.        The landlocked position of the country imposes an additional con-
straint. Far removed from sources of supplies of development goods and
access to export markets, development is more costly in Nepal than in many
other countries. Moreover, uncertainties of trade and transit over the sub-
continent complicates all economic decision-making, necessitates the holding
of relatively large foreign exchange reserves, and reduces the country's
attraction to private investors.

- 2 -
6.        The economy is predominantly agricultural.    About 67% of total
value added originates in agriculture, and over 90% of the labor force is
engaged in this activity. Agricultural products constitute more than 80% of
Nepal's exports. Ninety percent of these exports go to India. Rice, the main
export, accounts for about 60% of the total export value, while jute is the
second most important. Industrial value added amounts to only 4% of GDP and
Nepal, therefore, has to import almost all of its capital goods and a large
part of manufactured consumer goods.
7.        In the past decade, Nepal's GDP growth rate averaged 2.4% per year,
marginally above the rate of population growth. Thus far, development efforts
have been mostly directed towards building an economic and administrative in-
frastructure. This was necessary since it was only in the early fifties that
the Government adopted economic and social development as major objectives.
The investments in infrastructure made since then were the country's first
steps toward modernization. They have not yet paid off, however, in terms of
accelerated economic growth.
8.        There have been no significant changes in the trend of economic
growth in 1975/76. The weather continues to be the main factor which deter-
mines yearly fluctuations in growth. Last year, weather conditions were very
favorable, the grain crop was large, and GDP grew by about 4%, well above
the average 2.4% of the past decade. The balance of payments benefited from
temporarily larger rice exports, improved administrative control of rice
exports, increased incomes from tourism and increased inflow of remittances.
At the same time, imports of petroleum products, fertilizer, cement, and iron
and steel declined, because these items had been overstocked in the previous
year. Foreign exchange reserves rose by 6% to $119.7 million, the equivalent
of about nine months of imports. Last year's higher GDP growth rate and the
improvement in the balance of payments were chiefly due to fortuitous factors
rather than to an improvement in the longer term growth trend of the economy.
9.        After substantial efforts in the last two decades to build up the
country's infrastructure, Nepal's planners believe that the time has come for
a shift in the development strategy. The leading principle of the current
five-year plan (1976-80) is that Nepal should aim its development efforts at
deriving increased production benefits from its past efforts to establish and
expand the infrastructure. The allocation of investment funds under the plan
shows a drop in the share of transport and communications (from 41% to 23% of
the total) and corresponding increases in the share of agriculture, industry
and the social sectors. Attention is to be concentrated on quick-yielding
projects, mostly in agriculture but with an appropriate component of viable
import substitution in industry.
10.       The most important opportunity to reap production gains lies in
agriculture. Present yields in the Terai, where most of the foodgrains are
cultivated, average only 1-1.3 tons per hectare. These yieldscan be increased
substantially by improvements in agricultural extension, by increased appli-
cation of inputs, and by minor irrigation. Similar improvements could also
be extended to sugar and jute cultivation which also have very low yields.
The wide difference between growing conditions in the Hills and in the Terai



- 3 -
offers scope for increased specialization and exchange of products. For the
time being, the Hills must continue to emphasize food production in view of
the serious food deficits in the area. Hlowever, in the long run, the Hills
area is comparatively well suited to produce cash crops -- fruits, spices,
vegetables, potatoes, natural silk, etc. On a limited scale these items are
already being produced. Achievement of production gains will also require
the strengthening of marketing and credit institutions. Some progress in
institution-building has already been made in recent years, as evidenced by
the establishment of the Agricultural Development Bank and the Agricultural
Productivity and Service Center.
11.       Although agriculture must occupy a predominant position in Nepal's
development strategy, opportunities also exist in other directly productive
sectors, mainly industry and tourism, and these should be vigorously pursued.
The contribution of modern industry to GDP is still small, about 4%, but it
has been growing. Most of the sector consists of the processing of agricul-
tural products such as rice, wheat, vegetable oil, sugar and jute. The re-
mainder is made up of factories producing simple consumer goods, wood pro-
ducts, bricks, tiles and cement. The small size of the market, lack of raw
materials, competition from Indian products, and the shortage of domestic
entrepreneurs and trained workers will continue to be limiting factors for
some time. Modern industry, nevertheless, has its role in Nepal's future
development. The scope for processing of agricultural products for domestic
use and export should increase with the intended diversification of agricul-
ture. Further growth of the economy will also present scope for more import
substitution.
12.       Tourism has grown at 11.5% per year over the last five years;
tourist arrivals at present are estimated to be above 85,000. Foreign ex-
change earnings from this source are equivalent to those from merchandise
exports. In line with a master plan for the sector, prepared with German
assistance, a number of projects are to be undertaken to develop hill sta-
tions, observation points, and national parks as well as to restore ancient
temples and to strengthen the hotel school. While small in size, these
projects are important for the long-term development of tourism.
13.       On the basis of these and other considerations, it appears that
there is sufficient scope for development of the directly productive sectors
to allow a modest acceleration of GDP growth to perhaps 3.5% a year during
the last years of the decade and 4-5% in the 1980s. The proposed develop-
ment strategy appears to be appropriate to Nepal's circumstances. The past
ratio of investment (8.5-10.5% of GDP) to growth (2% of GDP) appears to be
very high and, in view of the scarcity of resources in Nepal, the planners
are right in looking for opportunities for more rapid growth without
neglecting the need for completion of the basic infrastructure.
14.       Nepal has made commendable efforts to mobilize domestic resources
for development. In the last five years, real revenue growth has averaged
over 7% a year, much higher than the growth rate of GDP, and budgetary
savings were maintained at 40% of revenue, slightly over 2% of GDP. This
result was obtained in the face of serious difficulties. On the revenue side,



- 4 -
Nepal suffers from the constraints of extreme poverty and low degree of mone-
tization of the economy. The open border with India moreover makes it diffi-
cult to control foreign trade and to levy the trade taxes which play such a
large role in the tax system of most developing countries. On the current
expenditures side, the Government has to cope with rising claims for main-
tenance of infrastructure and the need to raise government salaries from
levels which are low even by the standards of a poor country.
15.       In view of the pressures to increase current expenditures, all that
can be realistically expected in the next few years is that government main-
tains its savings rate at 2% of GDP. Only when economic growth starts to
accelerate significantly in the 1980s will there be prospects for an increase
in this rate. Given the constraints on mobilizing domestic resources, which
will prevail even with continued satisfactory fiscal management, foreign aid
will remain a decisive factor in Nepal's economic development. In fact, since
public savings are likely to increase less rapidly than public investment
during the period of the current five-year plan, aid will become, at least
temporarily, more important. In view of this scarcity of public savings, aid
will have to cover not only the foreign exchange cost of projects, but, as a
rule, also at least part of local cost. Total aid disbursements during 1971-
75 (the previous five-year plan) averaged $33 million a year in constant
(1974/75) prices and covered 45% of public investment. During 1976-80 (the
present five-year plan), this proportion would have to rise to 57% if public
investment is not to be held back by lack of financial resources. Under these
circumstances, disbursements in real terms would have to rise by around 12.5%
per year to average about $60 million in constant 1974/75 prices and about $90
million in current prices.
16.       The international community has thus far been very responsive to
these aid needs of Nepal. Shortage of finance has not yet been a bottleneck
and prospects are that aid flows of the required magnitude will continue to
be available. The real factor determining Nepal's development pace will
remain the growth of absorptive capacity, and it is this factor which will
determine the actual level of aid disbursements. The essential questions
regarding aid to Nepal are, therefore, what donors should do to attune their
aid programs to Nepal's development priorities and what they can do to raise
absorptive capacity.
17.       These questions, obviously requiring consultations between the Nepal
Government and the donors, provide the focus for the Nepal aid group which
had its first meeting in Tokyo last December. On the basis of sector and
project documentation prepared by the Government, the meeting reviewed the
type of projects needed to support the Government's development strategy
and the type of technical assistance programs needed to build up absorptive
capacity. Sustained attention to these matters in the framework of the aid
group is expected to lead to improvements in the composition of aid and to
speed up the still very slow rate of disbursement of aid funds.
18.       As of December 31, 1975, official foreign debt amounted to only
$120 million, of which 28% was to IDA. Of the $120 million, $86 million
remained undisbursed. This low utilization is largely due to the fact that
80% of foreign loans has been contracted since 1970. Debt service was about



- 5 -
$1.5 million in 1975 or equivalent to about 2% of exports of goods and ser-
vices. However, future assistance may increasingly take the form of loans.
Most of them will probably be on concessionary terms, which is highly desir-
able in view of Nepal's poverty and limited export prospects. In view of tlle
accelerated development efforts, external public debt is expected to rise and,
based on the trend in recent years, may reach about $350 million by 1980, of
which approxirnately 50% could be in IDA credits. The total debt service ratio
by 1980 is, however, projected to remain below 10%. I)ebt service to the Bank
Group alone would be less than 2% of exports of goods and services.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL
19.       The first IDA credit to Nepal in the amount of $1.7 million equiva-
lent was made in FY70 for a telecommunications project. This was followed
by credits for highways ($2.5 million), tourism ($3.2 million), irrigation
($6.0 million), a second telecommunications project ($5.5 million), a water sup-
ply and sewerage project ($7.8 million), a settlement project ($6.0 million),
a power project ($26.0 million) and a rural development project ($8.0 million).
Already approved in FY77 are a groundwater project ($9.0 million) and a techni-
cal assistance project ($3.0 million). Additional financing ($4.0 million) is
presently under consideration by the Executive Directors to assist in meeting
an anticipated cost overrun in the first Water Supply and Sewerage project.
The proposed credit would bring the total amount of IDA assistance to Nepal to
$90.7 million equivalent, net of cancellations. No Bank loans have been made
to Nepal. IFC made its first investment in Nepal ($3.2 million) in a hotel
project in Kathmandu in FY75.   Annex II contains a summary statement of
Baak Group operations as of February 28, 1977, and notes on the execution of
ongoing IDA projects. It shows that delays in the implementation of these
projects are common, particularly during the initial periods. These delays
have been largely due to Nepal's limited technical and managerial capabilities.
In order to assist Nepal in coping with this constraint, considerable technical
assistance is being given by Bank Group staff, including our Resident Mission
in Kathmandu. As a result, improvement in the rate oE disbursements is being
realized. During the first nine months of FY77, $4.2 million were disbursed
compare,l to $6.9 million disbursed during the entire previous six years. There
is, however, substantial scope for further improvement.
20.       Bank Group lending to Nepal has so far been at a modest level com-
pared to the country's need for, and total receipts of, external assistance.
The international community has persistently shown considerable interest in
Nepal's economic development and, to date, shortage of funds has not been a
bottleneck. The main constraLnt on the utilization of aid has been Nepal's
limited absorptive capacity, affecting the pace of project preparationi and
implementation. The Bank has agreed to assist the Government in project pre-
paration through the technical assistance credit and by acting as Executing
Agency for a number of technical assistance projects in the current UNDP Five-
Year Program. The Bank Group has addressed the problem of absorptive capacity
also through its role in organizing an aid group for Nepal (para 17).



- 6 -
21.       Tne Bank Group's current strategy places major emphasis upon the
directly productive sectors (particularly agriculture) and the development of
complementary infrastructure, including feeder roads (particularly roads
connecting the Hills to the Terai), communications and hydroelectric power. A
Nepal Industrial Development Corporation project is scheduled for presentation
to the Board in May 1977. A feeder road project has been appraised and is
expected to be negotiated before the end of the current fiscal year. Prepara-
tion of projects in irrigation, telecommunications, rural development and
horticulture is underway.
PART III - VWATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE IN NEPAL
22.       The water supply and sewerage sector in Nepal is still in a very
early stage of development. Only about 750,000 inhabitants (6% of the popula-
tion) living mostly in urban areas have access to water supply systems. About
20,000 house connections, including 5,000 metered connections, serve a popula-
tion of about 160,000. The balance of the population served uses standpipes.
The population that is not served (nearly 12 million) use the traditional
sources of water (private tubewells, dugwells, rivers, and other sources),
which are often of doubtful quality, with the threat of health hazards. As
for sewerage, only the center of Kathmandu is served by a small system. In
other towns and in the villages water borne sewerage is restricted to hos-
pitals, government buildings, and new houses with septic tanks. Drainage
systems, much needed in view of heavy rain during the monsoon, exist only
in a few towns.
23.       Due to insufficient sources, inadequate storage and distribution
capacity, and extensive leakage and wastage, the piped systems are only able
to provide water intermittently and service is generally restricted to a few
hours a day (4-6 hours in Kathmandu). Approximately 50% of the water produced
is lost through leakage and wastage. Quality control is generally inadequate.
Only the Kathmandu water supply system is subject to chemical quality testing
and occasionally to bacteriological tests. In addition, the Department of
Health carries out some surveillance when cholera or typhoid cases are reported
or suspected.
24.       There are three main Government agencies operating in the sector:
(a) The Water Supply and Sewerage Board (WSSB), which was formed
in 1973 under the Ministry of Water and Power (MWP) as the
Government's executing agency for the first IDA financed
Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit No. 470-NEP of
May 8, 1974), is responsible for the construction and
operation of the facilities in Kathmandu, Kathmandu Valley
and Pokhara. WSSB's present service area has about
470,000 inhabitants.
(b)  The Water Supply and Sewerage Department (WSSD), also
under MWP, is responsible for the construction and ope-
ration of water supply and sewerage schemes in all urban



-7-
areas not served by WSSB, regional and district head-
quarters, rural communities with more than 3,000 in-
habitants and certain urban and rural water supply
schemes not taken over by the panchayats (town coun-
cils). It is charged with the responsibility of ser-
ving a population of about 6.4 million.
(c)  The Local Development Department was created in 1971
under the Ministry of Panchayat to serve communities
of less than 3,000. It has responsibility for public
works, including water supply and sewerage. Its service
area has a population of about 5.7 million.
Among these agencies, WSSB is the best organized and operates on a commercial
basis. It is the Government's intention that, ultimately, WSSB will take
responsibility for the whole sector throughout Nepal. A sector report being
prepared under the IBRD/WHO Cooperative Program will, inter alia, focus on
the long-term organizational aspects of the sector. It is scheduled for com-
pletion in mid-1977.
25.       Government expenditures for new construction in the sector have
risen from approximately $150,000 in FY1971 to approximately $1.0 million in
FY1976 (including the first Water Supply and Sewerage Project), and are pro-
jected to reach an average of close to $8.0 million in the following five
years. More than two thirds of these investments would be carried out by
WSSB.
26.       The concept of paying adequate rates for water service was, until
recently, unknown in Nepal. This has contributed to substantial wastage of
water. Though st*ill at inadequate levels, water charges are being increasingly
introduced. As WSSB extends its area of activities and improves its service,
water charges will have to be increased if the supply of water is to remain
self supporting financially.
27.       In recent years a number of donors have been assisting Nepal in the
development of the sector and its agencies. Germany is providing assistance
to WSSD for the construction of a water supply system in central Bhaktapur,
an attractive tourist center in the Kathmandu Valley, while India has provided
similar assistance to WSSD and the Local Development Department. The UN Inter-
national Children's Emergency Fund has assisted the latter with the construc-
tion of small schemes in rural areas. The United Kingdom is providing WSSB
with a team of experts for technical assistance in engineering and financial
administration. UNDP provided financing for a Master Plan for the development
of water supply and sewerage facilities in Kathmandu Valley which was completed
in 1973. Despite this support, a considerable amount of work remains to be
done.
28.       IDA's first Water Supply and Sewerage Project (largely based on the
Master Plan referred to in the previous paragraph) provides for the improvement
and extension of water supply facilities in Kathmandu Valley and in Pokhara, a



- 8 -
major center for tourism, and sewerage facilities in Kathmandu and Lalitpur, a
suburb of Kathmandu. Implementation of the project is about a year behind
schedule mainly due to WSSB's inexperience at the beginning in dealing with
relatively complex contracts. However, major contracts (amounting to a total
of US$10.8 million equivalent) have been let. All remaining contracts are
expected to be let by June 1977, and construction to be completed by end-1978.
Due to worldwide inflation since the 1973 appraisal of the project, a cost
overrun of approximately US$6.0 million is expected. Additional financing
(US$4.0) to assist in meeting this cost overrun is currently under consider-
ation by the Executive Directors. In implementing the first project, the
Government has obtained technical assistance from the United Kingdom in the
fields of engineering, finance, leak detection, metering and quality control.
There has been substantial improvement as a result and arrangements are being
made for such assistance to continue. WSSB's need for technical assistance
will continue for the next few years in view of the shortage of qualified
Nepalese personnel and the planned extension of its service area.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       The proposed project is based on the Master Plan studies for Kath-
mandu Valley financed by UNDP, and studies for Pokhara, Biratnagar and Birganj
financed by the Government, all carried out by UK consultants. The studies,
completed in 1973, were reviewed in 1976 by WSSB assisted by U.S. consultants,
and the cost estimates were updated during project preparation. The project
was appraised in October, 1976. The appraisal report entitled "Nepal -
Appraisal of the Second Water Supply and Sewerage Project" (No. 1420b-NEP)
dated April 11, 1977 is being circulated separately. Negotiations were held
in Washington during March 9-17, 1977. The Government was represented by
Mr. K.D. Adhikari, Secretary, Miinistry of Water and Power. A Credit and
Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
Description of the Project
30.       The project is largely a continuation of the first IDA-financed
Water Supply and Sewerage Project. It consists of additional works in Kath-
mandu, Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara.     It also includes works in the towns of
Biratnagar, and Birganj. Biratnagar is a regional center in the Eastern Terai
and Birganj, a town astride the main access route from India to Kathmandu, is
an important regional center for trade in agricultural products. The works in
Biratnagar and Birganj were originally proposed as components in the first
project, but had to be excluded because the requisite funds could not be
found.
31.       The project includes construction of reservoirs and secondary water
supply distribution mains in Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara, and extensions to
the sewage collection systems in Kathmandu and Lalitpur. In Biratnagar and
Birganj, the project would be a first step towards improving and extending



- 9 -
the existing water supply systems. The project also includes studies for the
preparation of water supply schemes for six other towns; updating of water
supply and sewerage master plans; and a tariff study. The appointment of
consultants to assist WSSB in engineering and project implementation would
be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit (Section 7.01(a) of
the Development Credit Agreement). WSSB staff would continue to be trained
by the UK technical assistance team in the fields of engineering, adminis-
tration, finance, metering and laboratory work. Adequate facilities, equipment
and vehicles are included in the project for this purpose. The project is
expected to be completed by mid-1981.
Project Cost and Financing
32.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$11.0 million equi-
valent (excluding duties and taxes of approximately US$0.3 million equivalent).
This consists of US$5.1 million equivalent for water supply, US$0.8 million
equivalent for sewerage, US$1.5 million equivalent for engineering, technical
assistance in project implementation and studies, US$0.1 million equivalent
for project administration, and US$3.5 million equivalent for physical and
price contingencies. Details of project cost are included in Annex III. The
foreign exchange component is estimated at US$5.6 million equivalent. The
proposed credit of US$8.0 million equivalent would cover the foreign exchange
cost and US$2.4 million equivalent of the local cost (see para 15 above).
The Government would finance the remaining US$3.3 million equivalent (includ-
ing duties and taxes) as equity contribution to WSSB. The proceeds of the
credit would be relent to WSSB with interest at 9 percent per annum, for a
term of 25 years, including a five year grace period on the payment of prin-
cipal; interest during the grace period would be waived. The execution of a
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and WSSB would be a condi-
tion of effectiveness (Section 7.01(b) of the Development Credit Agreement).
Project Organization
33.       The proposed project would be carried out by WSSB.    WSSB's Board of
Directors consists of seven members under the chairmanship of the Secretary,
MWP. The other six members are the chief executive (the Project-in-Charge)
of WSSB, who serves as the Board's Secretary, the Chief Engineer of WSSD, and
representatives of the National Planning Commission and of the Mtinistries of
Finance, Health, and Panchayat. The present Project-in-Charge is well quali-
fied and experienced. The Government has agreed that at all times it would
fill the position of the Project-in-Charge with a person with qualifications
and experience acceptable to the Association (Section 4.02 (b)(i) of the
Development Credit Agreement).
34.       Whereas the consultants who prepared the first project had recom-
mended the creation of a water supply and sewerage corporation to operate as
a completely independent agency, the Government elected, with IDA's concurrence,
to establish WSSB within MWP as an interim agency until sufficient experience
had been gained. The creation of a Corporation will be considered in the
light of the recommendations of the sector report being prepared under the
IBRD/WHO Cooperative Program (para 24). WSSB's performance has improved



- 10 -
appreciably in recent months and it is considered capable of carrying out the
proposed project. The Government has agreed to extend the responsibilities of
WSSB to include Biratnagar and Birganj Water Supply systems (Section 4.05(ii)
of the Development Credit Agreement). In addition to technical assistance from
the UK, the Government would institute a program of training acceptable to the
Association (Sections 4.02(b)(ii) and 3.08 of Development Credit Agreement).
Financial Aspects
35.       Under the Development Credit Agreement for the first Project, WSSB
is required to achieve a rate of return of at least 1% on average net fixed
assets in operation for the fiscal years 1976-78. A water tariff increase of
60% in FY1975 enabled WSSB to realize a revenue surplus and almost fulfill
this requirement in FY1976. Credit 470-NEP also requires WSSB to achieve rates
of return in subsequent fiscal years rising gradually to 8% in FY1987 and
thereafter. It is proposed, however, that the rate covenant be modified to
require WSSB to achieve a rate of return in FY1979 of at least 2% rising
gradually to at least 6% in FY1987 and thereafter (Section 4.06 of the Devel-
opment Credit Agreement). In order to fulfill these rates of return, it is
estimated that WSSB will have to increase its tariffs by approximately 100%
in FY1979, with further substantial increases in following years, and a new
charge for sewerage. While the 6% rate of return is modest, it is considered
realistic in view of the substantial tariff increase required. Moreover, it
would be sufficient to enable WSSB to contribute increasingly to the financing
of its investment plans. This contribution is estimated to reach 20% in
FY1984. A study covering all aspects of demand and tariffs was to be carried
out by consultants under Credit 470-NEP in FY1977. Because of the delay in
implementation of the first project this study is now included in the proposed
project and to be carried out in 1978.
36.       During negotiations, it was also agreed that WSSB would not incur
any debt which would result in a revenue/debt service ratio below 1.5 with-
out the Association's approval (Section 4.07 of the Development Credit Agree-
ment). This is the same ratio as agreed under Credit 470-NEP.
Procurement and Disbursement
37.       Contracts would be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines, except for minor contracts for
equipment (each item below US$50,000) and civil works (each contract below
US$100,000), which would be let under local procurement procedures which
are satisfactory to IDA. The total of these minor contracts would not exceed
US$500,000 equivalent, including minor works done by force account. Although
there is no manufacturer of pipes in Nepal at present, such a factory could
be established within the project implementation period. A margin of prefer-
ence up to 15%, or customs duties if lower, is proposed for local manufac-
turers. A margin of preference of 7.5% would also be granted to local civil
works contractors.

38.       Disbursements would be made against:   (i)  100% of foreign expen-
ditures for directly imported equipment; (ii) 100% of local expenditures (ex-
factory) for locally manufactured equipment; (iii) 60% of local expenditures
for other goods procured locally; (iv) 100% of foreign expenditures and 30% of
local expenditures for civil works (including force account); and (v) 100% of
total expenditures for consulting services. A disbursement schedule is in-
cluded in Annex III.
Benefits and Risks
39.       Water supply of doubtful quality and inadequate quantity reached
only about 400,000 inhabitants in the present WSSB service area in July 1976
and sewerage facilities served only about 27,000 people. Upon its completion
in 1981, the proposed project would provide an adequate supply of safe water
to about 590,000 people (over 80% of the inhabitants of the project area)
and sewerage facilities for over 85,000. By 1985 the beneficiaries of the
water supply systems would be approximately 710,000 people, representing 96%
of the total population of the project area. The population thus served would
include a large majority of the urban poor in these areas. Further extension
of the services would require increased capital outlays. The health benefits
to the inhabitants of the project area and the reduction of pollution in the
Bagmati River would be the main benefits of the proposed project. Improvement
of sanitary conditions in Kathmandu Valley and in Pokhara would also benefit
the tourist industry which is an important foreign exchange earner for Nepal.
Another important benefit is the strengthening of WSSB as an institution
capable of improving and extending its services in the project area and ul-
timately over the whole country. The proposed project is the least cost
solution for providing these services, and future water charges would exceed
the average incremental cost of water by FY1981. While this would maintain
charges at levels affordable to the great majority, WSSB would continue to
be self supporting and financially viable.
40.       Project risks may arise from delays in project implementation and
from political and social pressure to avoid tariff increases as needed in
future to achieve the rates of return required for the financial viability
of WSSB. Technical assistance and increased supervision effort would help
meet the former, while the proposed tariff study would recommend tariffs which
maximize revenues within the consumers' ability to pay and ensure that the
urban poor can afford to obtain the minimum amount of water required by an
average family to maintain a healthy and productive life.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of lNepal
and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors separately.



- 12 -
42.        Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex IV. Additional conditions of effectiveness would be (i) effectiveness
of the agreement amending Development Credit Agreement 470-NEP to finance the
cost overrun on the first project; (ii) the appointment of consultants to
assist WSSB in engineering design and project supervision; and (iii) the
execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and WSSB
for relending the proceeds of the proposed credit.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   Projects in Execution I/
Credit No. 223 - Highway Project US$2.5 million Credit of December 21,
1970; Effective Date: February 3, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1975 - Revised Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Initially, project implementation was delayed mainly due to land
acquisition difficulties and a national shortage of cement and fuel. With
a delay of about eighteen months, the last of the five project road bridges
and the remaining two of the five porter suspension bridges were opened in
1976. All project road maintenance equipment has been received and is now
part of the Road Department fleet. Equipment workshop construction was
slowed due to contractual difficulties stemming from price escalation,
but the workshop construction is now almost completed. Although the total
project cost is approximately 11% above appraisal estimate the economic rate
of return is not affected due to the effect of general inflation on the
benefits. The project is virtually complete, with remaining disbursements to
be made by the closing date.
Credit No. 291 - Tourism Project US$3.2 million Credit (Net of Cancellation)
of March 22, 1972; Effective Date: November 9, 1972;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975; Revised Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
Due to delays in appointing qualified architectural, engi-
neering and project management consultants, and repeated changes in scope
proposed by the sponsors of the sub-projects, the project is two years behind
schedule. Construction of the Yak and Yeti sub-project is under way and
is expected to be completed by May 1977. On the other hand, it was not
possible to reach a firm agreement with the sponsors on an appropriate revi-
sion of the Annapurna sub-project, and $1.0 million of the Credit was cancelled
from the original allocation ($2.88 million) for that sub-project. The remaining
$1.88 million will meet increased costs of the Yak and Yeti sub-project and
finance feasibility studies for further tourism facilities outside the Kath-
mandu Valley. Consultants have been engaged and the feasibility studies are
under way.
Credit No. 373 - Birgani Irrigation Project US$6.0 million Credit of
April 18, 1973; Effective Date: July 9, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
Implementation of the project is progressing satisfactorily after
initial delays in appointing engineering consultants, field surveys and pro-
curement. About a third of the credit amount has been disbursed. Civil works

projects, in execution and in particular to report any problems which are
being encountered, and the action being taken. They should be read in

are being completed in one irrigation block, and are in progress in two further
blocks and contracts have been awarded for civil works in another two (out of
the or[ginal total of twelve). Construction of tubewells is 70 percent com-
pleted in the groundwater areas. Due to 50% cost overrun, a reduction of the
project area is being constdered. The project remains viable as a result of
increases in agricultural product prices, and higher-than-expected intensity
of cultivation.  The project should be completed by mid-1978.
Credit No. 397 - Telecommunications Project II US$5.5 million Credit of
June 20, 1973; Effective Date: September 11, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1980
Due to organizational problems, lack of continuity in senior manage-
ment, and delay in obtaining expert assistance, there have been delays in the
procurement process and the project is about two years behind schedule.    Good
progress is now being made with the assistance of experts and consultants pro-
vided by the UK and a. new manager has been appointed. The project is now
expected to proceed satisEactorily and present estimates are for completion
by early 1980, six to twelve months behind schedule.
Credit No. 470 - Water Supply and Sewerage Project US$7.8 million Credit of
May 8, 1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978
Design work is complete and most of the major contracts have now
been let.  Project implementation is about one year behind schedule, because
of delays in letting the contracts. A management team of four expects provided
by the UK has been assisting the Water Supply and Sewerage Board. The total
project cost is likely to exceed the appraised total by US$6.0 million and the
Government has requested that IDA assist in financing this cost overrun.
Credit No. 505 - Settlement Project US$6.0 million Credit of August 14, 1974;
Effective Date: February 20, 1975; Closing Date: July 15,
1982
Project implementation is two years behind the original schedule
but indications are that it is being accelerated. Twenty-three winch lorries
have been procured and operators are being trained in their use. Work has
also begun on clearing the timber fromn projected settlement areas. However,
the project is not yet free of problems, particularly in management and plan-
ning by concerned agencies, and intensive supervision of the project is con-
tinuing.   In addition, changes in the Government's land use policy have led
to requests, which are now under consideration, to restructure the project by
reducing its size by about 40%.

Credit No. 600 - Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project US$26.0 million Credit of
January 9, 1976; Effective Date: May 18, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1981
Bids for the major civil works have been received and are being
evaluated. Bid documents for plant and equipment are expected to be issued
around the end of April and contracts to be awarded around the end of
August 1977. Preliminary estimates indicate that cost overruns of probably
60% may materialize and sources of supplementary funds are being explored.
A supervision mission visited Nepal in March 1977 to assist the Government
in reviewing the civil works bid evaluation report.
Credit No. 617 - Rural Development Project US$8.0 million Credit of
April 30, 1976; Effective Date: July 16, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Progress to date continues to be generally satisfactory, with
almost all planned project actions being implemented ahead of schedule. Inter-
ministerial cooperation is good and at district level sound, and practical
development plans have been produced which are fully supported and understood
by project farmers. Adequate financing to carry out project proposals has
been made available in the budget by the Government; sites and plans for most
district construction projects have been completed and construction is expected
to begin in April; the seed exchange program has begun a year early and five
water supply schemes are expected to be completed by end-July. Shortage of
middle level staff in the project area for construction supervision and agri-
cultural extension may hinder project implementation in the coming year.
However, arrangements have been made for more efficient deployment of exist-
ing staff and for special training of Agricultural Assistants resident in
the project area to meet project needs. Under the associated Bank executed
UNDP technical assistance project, the assistant to the Project Coordinator,
the Irrigation Advisor, and the advisor to the Project Evaluation Unit have
been appointed.
Credit No. 654 - Bhairawa - Lumbini Groundwater Project US$9.0 million
Credit of July 9, 1976; Effective Date: November 9, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The project authorities have been established, the main consulting
firm has been appointed and has recently started its work, and arrangements
for procurement have been instituted. Drilling of tubewells is expected to
start in May 1977.
Credit No. 659 - Technical Assistance Project US$3.0 million Credit of
September 16, 1976; Effective Date: November 16, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
A list of six priority projects to be financed under the Credit has
been agreed with the Government, and arrangements for initiating studies are
being made.

Procurement
Arrangements:     All equipment and civil works contracts would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with IDA's Guidelines, except for minor con-
tracts for (a) civil works for water supply and sewerage
extensions, repairs, improvements, house connections
and metering, minor buildings and providing electricity
supplies, each individually below US$100,000; and (b)
equipment supplies each below US$50,000; which would be
let under local procurement procedures which are satis-
factory. The total of these contracts would not exceed
US$500,000, and may include works by force account. A
margin of preference of up to 15% or customs duty, which-
ever is lower, would be granted to local manufacturers
of equipment, and of 7.5% for local civil works con-
tractors.
Consultants:        1.    For updating of water supply and sewerage master
plans.
2.   For detailed design, preparation of tender documents,
evaluation of bids, and supervision of construction.
3.   For a tariff study, and
4.   For feasibility studies for six towns.

Technical
Assistance:       A management team including engineering, finance,
water treatment and laboratory experts and a trainer
in water system operations and maintenance (provided
by the UK).
Rate of Return:     A meaningful internal financial rate of return cannot
be calculated. However, projected future water charges
will be close to or exceed the average incremental
cost of water.
Appraisal Report:    No. 1420b-NEP dated April 11, 1977.
