INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXBCUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
AUTORIDAD PORTUARIA NACIONAL
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA
FOR A FISHING PORT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Autoridad Portuaria Nacional (APN) with the guarantee of the
Republic of Panama for the equivalent of US$2L million to help finance a
fishing port project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including
a 4-year grace period, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Led by manufacturing, by internationally-oriented service in-
dustries, and by a rapidly expanding financial sector, Panama's economy
grew rapidly in the 1959-1971 period at an average annual rate of 8
percent. In 1972-73 the GDP growth rate declined to 6.4 percent per annum
and in 1974 to 3.4 percent. The major causes of the recent slackening
of growth were the exhaustion of efficient import-substitution opportu-
nities in manufacturing, a reduction in private residential construction
reflecting a saturation of ttle market for upper and middle income groups
and deteriorating world-wide economic ccnditions to which an open economy
such as that of Panama is particularly sensitive, The last comprehensive
Bank economic report on Panama (275-PAN) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in November 1973.
3.        The implementation of the Government's ambitious capital invest-
ment and social programs takes on added importance in the light of the
slowdown in economic activity. The Government's development strategy is
aimed at providing the country with the economic infrastructure required
to maintain the dynamism of the urban, service-oriented sector which
capitalizes on Panama's tinique geographic location; at diversifying the
economy primarily by improving agricultural productivity and by exploit-
ing the country's mineral resources and at providing adequate social
services to the bulk of the population. Given the fact that the level
of public investment prior to 1968 was very low and that traditionally
social services were largely limited to the Panama-Colon metropolitan
areas, the attainment of the Government's objectives has required a
sharp rise in public current and capital outlays.
4.        Fixed investments by the public sector rose from B/36 million
in 1968 to B/100 million in 1973, or from 4.2 percent to 6.8 percent of



- 2 -
GDP, reflecting the execution of major programs in transportation, power,
agriculture as well as in health, education and housing. Public finan-
cial investment rose even faster, from under B/3 million in 1968 to
B/50 million in 1973, as the public sector provided increasing amounts
of credit for agriculture, industry and housing, and as it acquired
ownership of basic economic sectors, such as power, which were previ-
ously operated by private fcre_gn intere.-ts.
5.        Parallel with the increase in public investment, the Government
has expanded public services. In 1972, forty-three percent of the Govern-
ment's current outlays were for education and health. The number of
teachers in public schools and universities increased from 11,500 in 1968
to 17,700 in 1973, and the medical and paramedical personnel in official
health care centers rose from 2,300 to some 3,000 in the same period,
The effect of central government current outlays -- which increased from
13.3 percent of GDP in 1968 to 15.L percent in 1974 -- has been positive,
as it helped reduce the disparity in incomes between the metropolitan
area and the rest of the country.   However, this ecpansion has often been
costly and the authorities are currently strengthening mechanisms for
public budgeting and financial control, so as to enable them to continue
the expansion of social s ,rvices at a reduced fiscal cost,
6.        The growth of public revenues has been insufficient to finance
the expansion in public outlays.  Despite significant tax efforts which
raised government revenues from 14 percent of GDP in 1968 to 15;4 percent
in 1974, public investment has been almost three times as high as public
savings. This led to heavy Government borrowing from official and private
internal and external sources. Total Central Government debt outstanding
rose from B/170 million at the end of 1968 to B/612 million at the end of
197Th The large size of Panama's government debt and its unfav-rable
term structure -- over 52 percent of the Central Government's external
debt will have to berepaid by 1980 -- have led to mounting debt service
obligations. The ratio of Central Government debt service to current
revenues reached a high of 28.8 percent in 1972.1/ A $115 million re-
financing operation in 1973 lessened the immediate burden, but debt
servicing requirements will again rise after 1977.
70         The Government recognizes the need to increase the contribution
of public savings to the financing of public investment and to restrain
the growth of commercial borrowing. It has introduced a budget for 1975
that calls for keeping current outlays at B/294 million, a 10 percent
nominal increase over 1974, compared to a 31 percent increase in 1974
over 1973. Since this objective implies a decrease in-real terms, its
attainment will require continuing a number of strong controls on current
expenditures that were introduced in late 1974. The Government has taken
1/ Since the U.S. dollar is used as currency in Panama, the external
debt service ratio is less relevant than the ratio of debt service
to fiscal revenues.



effective measures to improve tax enforcement. Several new taxes were
enacted in 1974 and assuming the timely adoption of a tax package in-
cluded in the 1975 budget, current revenues could reach B/337 million
in 1975, a 25 percent increase over 1974. If these budget targets are
met, it would be possible to bring the Central Government overall
deficit down from B/85 million in 1974 to B/68 million in 1975 in spite
of the programmed B/23 million increase in capital outlays (to B/ill
million).
8.        Barring a severe economic recession, the B/43 million savings
target for 1975 should be attainable and could be maintained in succeed-
ing years. This would require only modest new cornmercial borrowing on
the assumption that the Government will coi!tinue to improve project
preparation and to submit for financing by development agencies a hi-gh
proportion of total public investment. guch a course would enable Panama
to improve its debt profile since it is expected that the development
agencies would take the lead in offering extended grace periods and cor-
respondingly long maturities on their loans to Panama. On these assump-
tions, the ratio of the Central Government's debt service to its current
revenues should not exceed 25 percent in 1978 when debt service on
existing debt will reach its hi-hest level.
9.        The Government is currently preparing a Five-Year Development
Plan which should be completed before the end of CY1975. It is expected
that the Plan will seek to rationalize and more clearly define the role
of the public sector by an analysis of three important policy areas. The
first is a definition of the respective roles of the public sector and
fOr private enterprise particularly with respect to mining and industry,
sectors in which some major investment projects are under consideration.
The second area relates to measures to increase the buoyancy of public
revenues so as to obviate the need for the enactrment of new taxes every
time that public expenditures increase as a result of inflation. The
third area is the financing of public investment and the establishment
of targets for central government savings, public domestic and external
borrowing and the contribution or the revenue-earning autonomous public
agencies.
10.      IWle conclude that Panama is creditworthy for some further Bank
lending. This assessment is based on the fiscal effort that the Government
is making in the face of relatively unfavorable economip conditions; on the
likelihood that economic growth will be sustained with the stimulus of a
continued high level of public investment and on the judgment that Panama's
comparative advantage as a center for international trade and finance pro-
vides a solid basis for long-term growth.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
ll        The Bank has to date made ten loans to Panama totalling
$118.1 million. Of these, two loans (totalling $13.1 million) for
road construction, two loans (totalling $0.9 million) for agricul-
ture and a $4.0 million loan for power were made prior to 1963 and
have been fully disbursed. On-going projects include a power
generation project for which the Bank lent $42.0 million in 1970;
an airport project (Tocumen International Airport) for which the Bank
lent $20.0 million and a fisheries credit project for which the Bank
lent $3.4 million, both in 1971; a livestock credit project for which
the Bank made a $L.7 million loan and a power transmission project
for which the Bank made a $30.0 million loan, both in 1973.   Imple-
mentation of the two power projects and of the airport projects has
suffered considerable delays and substantial cost overruns. Steps
are being taken to overcome the causes of the delays and implementa-
tion is now improving. Implementation of the fisheries project has
been satisfactory although the scope of the project was reduced
because of higher than originally estimated trawler prices. Execution
of the livestock project has been delayed by weaknesses in project ad-
ministration. IFC has made one investment in Panama: a commitment in
1971 to acquire $0.3 million of equity in the Corporacion de Desarrollo
Hotelero S.A. and to lend to the Corporacion $1.2 million to build a
new international hotel. IFC is not presently considering any further
operations in Panama. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and IFC investments as of February 28, 1975 and notes on the
execution of on-going projects.
12.        Bank lending to Panama has been in support of the Govern-
ment's ambitious investment program which is designed to capitalize
on Panama's strategic geographic location as a crossroads of hemispheric
and world trade and to progressively integrate the previously neglected
rural population into the mainstream of Panama's development. To these
ends, the Government is investing extensively in the country's infra-
structure facilities while, at the same time, improving and expanding
the social services and credit facilities available to the agricultural
sector.
13e        The proposed Fishing Port project would assist the Govern-
ment's program of fully exploiting Panama's considerable fisheries re-
sources with the twin objectives of increasing exports and of improving
the diet of the Panamanian population. The Government has also asked
the Bank to continue its support of the country's power expansion pro-
gram with special emphasis on the development of its hydro potential;
to assist in the rehabilitation and modernization of the road network
in the context of the recently prepared National Transport Survey
(for which the Bank was executing agency) and to consider providing
assistance to the Government's program for the settlement of the eastern
parts of the country which are now being opened up by the construction



of the sections of the Pan-American Highway linking Panama City to
Cclombia.
14.        The principal sources of external financing to Panama in the
past are summarized below:

j Including a $60 million grant from the U.S. Government,for
completion of the Darien Gap portion of the Pan-American Highway.
Both AID and IDB have lent heavily for agriculture and for social services.
This pattern is likely to persist although IDB is expected to continue
lending for the transportation sector and may also provide assistance for
the power expansion program. To a large degree, AID and IDB concentra-
tion on agriculture and the social sectors reflects the Government's
policy of directing borrowing on highly concessionary terms to those sectors
while utilizing assistance received on harder terms for projects which are
expected to result in more immediate economic benefits,
15.        The Bank's share in Panama's publicly-guaranteed external debt
outstanding and disbursed was 6.8 percent at the end of 1973 and the Bankts
share of public external debt service was 3.4 percent. Its share in
Panama's external debt is likely to rise to 12 percent by the end of the
1970's and its share of external public debt service would be no more
than 10 percent.
PART III - The Fishing Sector
16.        Panama's location on the isthmus separating the Caribbean from
the Pacific provides decided advantages in developing a domestic fishing



-6 -
industry and in servicing the international tuna Ileets operating off
the Pacific coast.  On the Pacif'ic side, the waters are rich in fish
resources, especially in the _ulf of Panama which supports sizeable
stocks of commercially valuable species such as shrimp. The tuna
fleets which, in accordance with the regulations of the Inter-American
Tropical Tuna Commission can only fish in the eastern Pacific tuna
grounds during the first quarter of the year, are increasingly trans-
shipping their catch in Panama Bay in order to avoid time-consuming
trips to their home ports.
17.        The main fishing activities in Panama are shrimp trawling
and processing, reduction to fishmeal of anchovy and herring, inshore
fishing for food fish, and servicing of the international tuna fleets,
The industry enploys about hL,600 people or about one percent of the
economically active population and its shrimp exports rank second
(after bananas) among Panama's merchandise exports. Although the
fishing industry has grown vigorously over the last two decades, it is
still far from having reached its potential both as an earner of foreign
exchange and as a source of food for domestic consumption. The main ob-
stacles to further development have been (a) obsolescence of the local
fishing fleet; (b) lack of adequate port facilities; (c) lack of know-
ledge on fish resources; and (d) inadequate local distribution and
marlketing facilities which contribute to a relatively low per capita
consumption of fish.
18.        The Panamanian Government, which attaches high priority to
the fishing industry, has taken a number of important measures to deal
with the above-mentioned constraints.  It has, with the assistance of a
Bank loan (78L-PAN), provided credit facilities for the modernization
of the shrimp fleet and has obtained financing from the IDB for a, proJec-t
to develop inshore fishing.  Panama, which participates in the UNDP/FAO
Regional Project for Central American 'ishery Development, has obtained
UNDP/FAO assistance for resource surveys and for strengthening the dis-
tribution and marketing of' food fish. The resource surveys have already
led to the discovery of promising new deepwater shrimp grounds.
1 9       The Government has also taken measures to protect the fishing
resources from over-fishing and depletion, 'Phe Directorate for Mlarine
Resources, under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, is responsible
for the administration and development of the fishlng industry.  As such,
it formulates and enforces fishing regulations which in6lude restrictions
on the number and horsepower of shrimp trawlers in operation. Thc
Directorate also conducts biological investigation, exploratory fishing,
collects and publishes fishing statistics and assists in fish marketing
efforts, It receives guidance from the National Fisheries Commission
comprising representatives of the fishing industry and seamen's trade unions.
20.       It was originally envisaged that the Bank-financed fisheries
project would lead to the replacement of about 40 wooden shrimp boats



by modern steel trawlers. Due to the sharp world-wide increase in the price
of trawlers, the available funds will be sufficient to procure only about
23 trawlers (all of which have been ordered). Despite the rise in trawler
prices, demand for credit by the industry remains strong and the Government
may consider providing additional credit facilities as soon as there is
sufficient experience with the new trawlers. Another factor to be taken into
account i!i the recent discovery of deepwater shrimp which may require bigger
boats with more powerful engines and winches.
21.       The modernization of the Panamanian shrimp and inshore fishing
fleets now needs to be complemented by the provision of adequate port facili-
ties. In the Gulf of Panama, where the most important fish resources are
concentrated, all the shrimp landing wharves dry out at low tide thereby
severely restricting the time available for the approach and departure of
vessels. Three of the five wharves, as well as several shrimp processing
plants, are located along the waterfront in the heart of Panama City.   The
facilities are cramped for space and their presence has prevented the develop-
ment o, the commercially valuable downtown area of the city. Coastal fisher-
men who supply about 50 percent of the production of food fish (the remainder
comes from the incidental catch of shrimp trawlers and fishmeal boats) use the
Panama City sea wall and other accessible landing places.   Such arrangements
will no longer be satisfactory as inshore fishing is developed.
22.       The Government's objectives of increasing foreign exchange earnings
from servicing the international tuna fleet and of developing a domestic tuna
fleet likewise require the construction of specialized port facilities.   Tuna
transshipment is presently carried out mainly in sheltered waters off Taboga
Island and the lack of adequate facilities is inhibiting the growth of this
operation whiclh could offer considerable economic benefits to Panama.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       It was concluded, at the time the on-going Fisheries Credit Project
was appraised by the Bank, that the long-term development of the fisheries
indusktry required the construction of a fishing port as a matter of hig_h
priority. Because there is no port in Panama for sheltering or berthing
fishing vessels, damage to vessels is frequent and operating costs are high.
Consequently, provision was made under Loan 784-PAN for financing of a port
feaslibility study.  The feasibility study which was prepared by consultants
ser-ied as the basis for the fishing port project appraised by the Bank in
August 1974. Negotiations were held in Washington on February 24-25, 1975.
The Pan-iamanian delegation was headed by Mr. Arnoldo Cano, Director-General of
the Autoridad Portuaria Nacional. Annex III of this report sumnarizes the
project and loan.  An Appraisal Report (No. 629a-PAN) is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors.
,tDescrition
24.       The proposed project would be the first Bank-financed port
project in Panama. The main objectives of the project are to promote



- 8 -
efficient operations and growth of the fisheries industry by providing
adec-tate port Cacilities and other infrastructure needed for f'ish pro-
cessing and tuna transshipment; assist in developing 'he management
capab.il.ity o.f the newL,y created National Port Authority (APN) and faci-
litate the implementation cf urban renewal in Panama City by removing
fish landin.irg anld processing facilities from the city,
25.        The project cornsists of:  (a) construction at Punia Vacamonte,
about 30 kms, to the west oiP Panama Ci-ty, of a fishing port with a pro-
tective breakwater, dre(iged access channel, 10 berths for shrimp trawlers,
la 'erths for tuna boats, quays for berthing inshore fishing vessels and
for ser-v-icing trawlers, a ship-repair berth and yard, buildings for shrimp
processing, a tuna cold storage plant, a fish market, administrative and
other offices, storage areas, roads and utility service<s; (b) provision
of consultant services for dcsign, supervision of construction and tech-
nical assistance in port operation and nanagement; and (c) a program for
training AP1P's staff,
26.       The Government, would construct a :10 kin. road coninectirng the
po-.t site to the Pan-American i-Iighway and assure extension of power and
tetephone services ald water supply to serve the port. Assurances
were received that these faci.lities would be completed as required for
the development of the fishing port and that the road would be adequately
maiLnt.ai4ned thereafter (Sectiions 3.02 and 3.03 of the draft Guarantee Agree-
ment). The power, telephon;e and water supply connections would be financed
by the utili ty co!rpanies which would recover their cost from service sales
to the fishing- port.  The hiousing facilities for port personnel, near the
new port site, wou:ld be prov ded by the Government as and when needed
(Section 3 05 of the draft Guarantee Agreement)0
Project Cost and Financing
27.        Total project costs are estimated at $3L.0 million. Allowances
of, 7percent on the average for physical contingencies and 22 percent f'or
price contingencies have been included in project cost estimates and are in
line with recent trends, The foreign exchange cost is estimated at
$2065 million, including cont.ingencies. A summary of project cost is
found in Annex III. A. Banl loan of $20O0 mrillion is recommended to finance
the foreign exchange cost of the project and interest during construction
on the proposed Bank loan, which is estimated at $3.5 million. It is
recommended that the loan finarnce interest during construction because the
newly created APN does not have at present any significant sources of revenue
and it would be undersirable, given the Government's tight fiscal situation,
to seek an increased budgetary contribution to APN.  Local currency costs
estimated at $13.5 million would be covered by the Government in the form
of a contribution to APN (Section ?.02 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).



9-
Project Execution and Operation
2&.        The APN would be responsible for project execution.  APN was
established in May 1974 to plan, design, build, operate and improve all
national ports. These now comprise an oil refinery terminal, two
banana ports,and lighterage facilities in Panama City, Colon and other
locations.
29.        The Basic Law of APN, which was drawn up with the advice of
an UNCTAD expert on port administration, is acceptable to the Bankc0 It
authorizes APN to set and collect tariffs as well as to contract loans,
Agreement was reached with the Government and APN that APH's tariffs
would be revised from time to time to ensure that APN's revenues at ports
other than the fishing port would be sufficient to cover the full coSt of
its services and to earn a reasonable return on the net fixed assets of
each port (Section 5.05 of the draft Loan Agreement)..  Assurances were
also obtained that APII will engage independent auditors .atisfacltory to
the Bank (Section 5eO2 of the draft Loan Agreement). Because APN!'s
administrative, technical and financial capacity is still limited,
assurances were received that APN will not, without the Bank's prior
agreement, (a) carry out any capital investment in excess of $10   14]lion
per year befTre December 31, 1985 (Section 5.07 of the draft TLoan Arree-
ment) nor (b) incur any long-term debt which would result in APN having
debt service covered less than 1,4 times by net revenues (Section 5,06
of the draft Loan Agreement).
30.        APN is managed by an Executive Committee composed of the
Minister of Commerce and Industry (Chairman), the Ministers of Planning
and Economic Policy, of Finance and Treasury and of Public Works and one
representative, respectively, of port users and of port workers. The
Director-General of APN, appointed by the Executive Committee, is res-
ponsible for day to day adninistration. The incumbent Director-General
is a well qualified engineer who has served with the Panama Canal Company.
The Government would undertake to maintain an experienced a(hninistrator
in the position of Director General of APN (Section 3.06 of the draft
Guarantee Agreement), who would be assisted by a qualified and experienced
staff (Section 4.02 of the draft Loan Agreement)0
31.        APN is in the process of expanding and training its staff with
the assistance of the UNDP/UNCTADo Its comprehensive training program
and the technical assistance component of the proposed project should
provide APN with adequate management capability.
32.        APN would engage consulting engineers to prepare detailed
engineering and would retain project supervision consultants acceptable
to the Bank. A project team acceptable to the Bank is to be established



- 10 -
within APN to supervise and coordinate project execution (Section 3.04 of
the draft Loan Agreement).  Appointment of the project team manager would
be a condition for loan effectiveness (Section 7.01 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
33.       The fishing port would be directly run by an Administrator
appointed by APN. A Fishing Port Committee, chaired by the Director-
General of APN, would consist of the Administrator and representatives
of the Directorate of Marine Resources and of the fishing industry, and
would advise the Director-General on the policies to be implemented by the
Administrator. The Borrower would establish the Comiruittee by December 31,
1975 (Section 4.O04 of the draft Loan Agreement).  Assurances were received
that the appointment of the Fishing Port Administrator, with qualifications
and experience satisfactory to the Bank, would take place not later than
July 1, 1976 (Section 4.03 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Financial Aspects
34.       User charges would be set by APIN yielding annual rates of return
on the fishing port's net fixed assets of not less than 7 percent in the
second full year of operation and rising progressively to 9 percent by the
sixth and following years (Section 5.04 of the draft Loan Agreement).
35.       These charges would recover 70-80 percent of estimated economic
benefits to the fishing industry, the difference to be an incentive for
the fishing industry to transfers its operations to the new site.   In addi-
tion, shrimp processors would realize increased value of their in-town
properties after moving their plants to the new port. In order to ensure
full use of the new port the Government has enacted legislation to the
effect that the shrimp processors and ship repair yards in the Province of
Panama will relocate to Punta Vacamonte, as soon as the new port is ready,
according to a timetable to be agreed upon with the Bank (Section 3.07 of
the dra't Guarantee Agreement).   The Government has obtained letters from
a substantial number of tuna boat operators declaring their intention to
use the port's tuna transshipment facilities.
36.       The major part of the difference between the 15 percent estimated
economic rate of return (see below) and the 9 percent estimated financial
rate of return is explained by the exclusion from financial benefits of
(a) increases in land value in Panama City, and (b) the setting of port
charges at a level which would not fully recover estimated economic benefits
(see preceding paragraph) so as to provide an incentive for the fishing indus-
try to use the new port. If the increases in land values and real estate
taxes accruing to the Government were added to the financial benefits, the
financial rate of return would be 11 percent.
Procurement and Disbursements
37.       Contracts for civil works and equipment would be awarded under
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines.   Bid
documents for civil works would permit bidding either for the entire work



or for separate groups of items such as harbor works, buildings and
utilities.  Local contractors may perform part o. the civil works either
as direct contractors for smaller items or as sub-contractors or Dartners
in major contracts.   Retroactive financing up to $300,000 is recommended
for consulting services expenditures incurred after January 1, 1975.   No
equipment for the project is expected to be manufactured in Panama.
38.       Disbursements would cover 56 percent of the total cost of civil
works which corresponds to the estimated foreign exchange cost of civil
works; 100 percent of the c.i.f. price of equipment; and 60 percent o. the
total cost of consultants' services.   The training program, though part of
the project,will be financed by the Government and UNDP and implemented
by UNCTAD.
Economnic Justification
39.       Quantifiable benefits from the project are expected to accnre
to shrimp and food fish vessel owners and operators, shrimp processors,
and to the Government as a landowner.   The economic benefits include savings
in repair maintenance and waiting time for shrimp   trawlers; removal of
capacity constraints at present food fish landing facilities; net value added
in processing as a result of the reduction in damaged shrimp and of the
availability of the new deep sea shrimp species; value of the land released
for urban renewal in Panama City as well as the enhancement in value of the
released land and of adjacent property.   Th_ economic benefits also include
net value added in Panama by the expected increase of tuna transshipmenlt
ooerations. A calculation of the present valule of project benefits indicates
that thev would be distributed as follows: shrimp vessel owners and operators,
22.3 percent; shrimp processors, 25.9 percen-t; coastal fishermen, 14.0 percent;
value added in Panama from tuna services, 27.7 percent; the Government as
landowner, 10.1 percent.
40.       On the basis of an economic life of 25 yearF, the project is
expected to yieid an economic rate of return of about 15 percent. The
eccnornic rate of return would not fall below 12 percent even if (a) project
costs were to increase by 30 percent, or (b) tuna transshipment traffic were
reducecd by 30 percent, or (c) the deepwater shrimp resources prove not to
be corimercia]ly exploitable, or (d) expected increases in land values in
Panama City were not to materialize.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and APII, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Panama and the Bank, the report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of the Resolution approving the proposed Lcan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Besides the
specific features mentioned elsewhere in the report, the draft Guarantee
and Loan Agreements conform to the usual pattern of loans for ports.



- 12 -
i2.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXUUTICIUY
TLOC.N A 661                   SECOLJ PO1ER PROJECT  US$42 MnnLIOa LOAP
OF MARCH 16, 1970; CLOSiNG DATE: APY1L i07 1976
Bayano hydrodevelopment with transmission is about half completed with
f'inal completion expected about 18 months later than anticipated during appraisal.
Other components - including the Las Minas 40 MW thermal unit - have been com-
pleted with a delay of up to 9 months. As a result of measures initiated early
in 19714 the major Bayano contractor has more than doubled production rave.
Installation of power plant equipment is to begin in April 1975, with the f'irst
generator to be on-line in April 1976. Project cost is now estimpted at $88.7
million, about 52% above estimates at time of appraisal. In spite of the
cost-overruns, the project remains the least cost alternative because of
increases of fuel costs for thermal plants.
LOAN 783           TOCUMNE  INTERRNATIONAL AIRPORT PROJECT; US$20 MILLION LOAN
OF AUGUST 2, 1971: CLOSING DATE: DECEMBER 31, 1975
Implementation of civil works is slow. Though earthworks on the new
runway are almost completed, paving of the runway will not be completed before
end of 1975. The first rounds of tendering on the terminal building were
cancelled when bids were exceptionally high0 Revised standards and minor
modification of design have now attracted bids nearer to revised cost estimates
and are being reviewed by the airport authority0 Project completion is now
estimated for September 1977.
LOAN 784            FISHERIES PROJECT; US$3.14 MILLION LOAN OF AUGUST 2, 1971;
CLOSING DATE: SEPTa3EBR 30, 1976
The project, which is designed to increase efficiency of the Pan2m2nian
shrimp industry,consists of (1) construction of shrimp trawlers; (2) a trawler
captainst training program; and (3) a fishing port feasibility study0 The
captains' training program is proceeding with the assistance of the UNIDP and
FAO. The fishing port feasibility study was completed in February 19714 and led
to the preparation of the project under consideration in this report. Constructior
of trawlers is underway with the first trawlersalready in service. How-
ever, the scope of the project had to be reduced from the originally intended
40 trawlers to 23 trawlers due to escalation of' costs0
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executivre Pi.rectors regarding
the progress of projects/investments in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being takPen to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.
