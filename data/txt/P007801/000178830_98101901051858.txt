GLOSSARY
seiner     -      a fishing vessel that captures pelagic fish by
surrounding a school with a large cylindrical net.
A cable then draws the bottom of the net together
(pursing) after which the captured fish can be
brought aboard with a smaller dip net called a
brail.
trawler    -      a fishing vessel that captures demersal fish by
dragging or trawling a scoop shaped net along a
sandy sea bottom. The shape of the net and its
associated hardware force the fish into a net bag
called the cod end which is used to bring the
captured fish aboard the vessel.
long liner -      a fishing vessel which is used primarily to capture
large pelagic fish by means of baited hooks on
branch lines attached to a main long line that may
be several miles in length. As the long line is
hauled aboard, the captured fish are removed from
the hooks manually.
pelagic    -      fish that live and are caught at or near the
surface of the sea.
demersal   -      fish that live and are caught at or near the
sea bottom.
cephalopod -      a class of mollusks that includes octopus,
squid and cuttlefish.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
PANAMA FISHING PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 1114-PAN)
PREFACE
This report represents a performance audit of the Panama Fishing
Port Project, for which Loan 1114-PAN for US$24 million equivalent was
approved on April 22, 1975.    The loan was fully disbursed on March 18, 1980.
The report consists of a Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared
by the Latin American and Caribbean Regional Office and a Project Performance
Audit Memorandum prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
OED has reviewed the PCR against the Appraisal and President's
Reports, the legal documents and the transcripts of the Executive Directors'
meeting which considered the project.    Project files and documents have also
been reviewed and discussions held with Bank operational staff. An OED
mission visited Panama in August 1982 and discussed the project with the
Panamanian authorities whose cooperation is gratefully acknowledged.        The
report was sent to these authorities for comments but none were received.
The audit finds that the PCR provides a comprehensive review of most
aspects of project experience.     The audit supplements the PCR on certain
points, particularly regarding operations of the fishing industry.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT' REPORT
PANAMA FISHING PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 1114-PAN)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project proposed removal of shrimp landing and associated
processing facilities from the central area of Panama City to a new location
about 30 km away. It also intended to provide other fisheries related instal-
lations, including berthing and storage facilities for tuna vessels, berthing,
storage and marketing facilities for artesanal and larger scale fisheries to
supply the local market and ship servicing facilities for all these vessels
and for seiners which supply several Panamanian fish meal plants. The project
was built quite expeditiously and included all the foregoing facilities.
However, it was somewhat redesigned and there were significant cost overruns.
The project also resulted in the establishment of an effective port authority
and the Bank made significant contributions when that authority was greatly
expanded to assume enlarged responsibilities after the Panama Canal Treaty.
While the Panamanian shrimp fleet is using the harbor and associated
facilities as anticipated, other uses have not developed in accordance with
projections. Most importantly, use by tuna vessels is very low and the
fishery for the local market has not developed.    However, some international
trawlers (notably from Cuba and East European countries) are calling at
Vacamonte, a use that was not foreseen at appraisal.   The net effect of these
developments is a substantial reduction in benefits and a reduction of the ERR
to about 7% and poor financial performance. The economic and financial
performance of the project will continue to be poor unless the international
trawler fleet increases its use of Vacamonte to replace the major shortfalls
in use by the international tuna fleet and by domestic fishermen (other than
shrimpers).
The overestimate in potential use of the harbor resulted from
weaknesses in the economic analysis of the identification report which were
carried over into the appraisal. The analysis overestimated potential
fisheries resources and gave inadequate appreciation to the factors in-
fluencing the choice of fishing harbors by fisheries operators.
Points of special interest and lessons learned include the fol-
lowing:
(a)  the need for definite commitments by potential users to utilize
facilities constructed for their use (PPAM, para. 15);
(b)  the need for appropriate evaluation of benefits from improved
land use to account for uncertainties regarding redevelopment (PPAM,
para. 17);












(c) the desirability of evaluating realistically the prospects of
products to be newly introduced to a market (PPAM, para. 19);
(d) the need to coordinate concurrent investments which make essential
contributions to the success of a project (PPAM, para. 20);
(e) the desirability on the part of Bank staff of expertise specially
suited to the content of a project (PPAM, para. 22);
(f) the need for project design to take full account of prospective
technological change (PPAM, para. 28);
(g) the importance of constructing analysis and sensitivity tests on
relevant critical variables (PPAM, paras. 35-40);
(h) the limited influence of a country's regulations in affecting the
decisions on port usage of international fisheries operators (PPAM,
para. 43);
(i) the need to assess operations in detail in order to design improve-
ments (PPAM, para. 44);and
(j) the need for coordination in the case of fisheries projects both
within the Bank and between the Bank and other financing agencies
(PPAM, para. 60).












PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
PANAMA - VACAMONTE FISHING PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 1114-PAN)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The Bank Group has financed fisheries related projects in the two
broad categories of aquaculture, in which fish or shellfish are raised and
harvested in proprietary enclosed ponds, and offshore fishing, in which
fish or shellfish are captured in their natural habitat in the sea or in lakes
or rivers.   The Bank'Group has assisted offshore fisheries projects in three
ways:
(a) financing of investment by 'Government or parastatal entities in
vessels, shore facilities, training, and technical assistance;
(b) financing of private investment in vessels through onlending
by development institutions; and
(c) financing construction of fishing ports.
Thus far, projects under (a) have been handled by agricultural units in the
Bank Group, projects under (b) have been handled by IDF or agricultural units,
and projects under (c) have been handled by transportation units. The
recently issued fisheries policy paper ("Fisheries Development: Sector Policy
Paper", Report No. 3915 of May 1982) addresses policy issues surrounding
fisheries projects of the type usually' associated with agricultural units,
though it makes no mention of fisheries projects of the type usually associ-
ated with transportation units of the Bank'Group.   Thus far, only projects of
type (a) have been audited.11    This audit and another being issued shortly
(Nouadhibou Fishing Port Project, Credit 588-MAU) are the first audits of
projects devoted exclusively to fishing ports.
2.        The audit considers that all offshore fisheries projects, whether
they emanate from a transportation unit or an agricultural unit, should
address, at a minimum, five related issues:
(a) The resource - is there a body of fish of one or more species
of sufficient abundance to support the proposed development?
(b)  The market - is there a local or world market for the resource
with a price structure and demand function consistent with the
cost of catching the fish and processing and transporting it?
1/   An emergency rehabilitation project for fisheries harbors also was
audited (Iceland Fishing Harbors Rehabilitation, Loan 941-IC, Report No.
1960 of March 10, 1978, SecM78-211).



(c) The fleet - does there exist or will there be provided a domestic or
international fleet of vessels able to catch and, if needed, process
the fish in an economic manner?
(d) The port - does there exist or will there be provided a port suit-
able to the needs of the fleet and related processing, service, and
transport vessels?
(e) The other infrastructure - does there exist or will there be
provided other infrastructure necessary to support the fleet
and its personnel?
(f) Goverment policy - does the 'Government have in place or under
development a realistic marine resources development policy and the
institutional framework to administer that policy.
3.        In general, Bank Group financed fisheries projects that have per-
formed below expectation have done so because one or more of the above five
issues was inadequately addressed or not addressed at all at the time of
appraisal.   The reasons for the deficiency vary from one project to the next
but there appears to be a tendency to concentrate on those issues which
correspond most closely to the other major skills of the unit handling the
project.   Thus, an agricultural unit may tend to concentrate more on the
resource and the market while a transportation unit may tend to concentrate
more on the port and physical facilities. In either case, there is a tendency
to overlook important questions dealing with other issues and to fail to gain
the knowledge and understanding necessary to deal with all five issues ade-
quately.
4.        The project being audited here and the Mauritania project have many
parallels as well as some contrasts which serve to underscore the main issues
of each project and the conclusions to be drawn from them about future Bank
Group activities in the fisheries sector.    These parallels are the basis for
joint issuance of the two audit reports. Among the areas of closest parallel
are:
(a) Fleet
Both projects were directed in a major way at international fleets
of fishing vessels. In the Panama project, it was the international
tuna fleet consisting primarily of American tuna seiners and
Japanese longliners, though other project elements addressed purely
domestic operations, particularly the successful consolidation of
domestic shrimp operators in a protected and tide independent harbor
away from the urban area of Panama City. In the Mauritania project,
the historically most important fleets are the Spanish, Portuguese,
and Japanese trawler fleets, fishing mainly for cephalopods and
other premium demersal species as well as several European fleets
rigged for midwater trawling or seining of pelagic species.

-3-
(b) Competition
Because of the physical mobility and freedom of operation of
international fishing fleets, both ports are subject to competition
from other nearby ports.     The port of Vacamonte in Panama faces
internal competition from the Taboga anchorage for transshipment
operations and from the port of Balboa for bunkering and other
shoreside services. In addition Panama as a whole faces competition
from Mexico, Costa Rica, and other tropical Eastern Pacific coun-
tries, though none yet offers the breadth of, services available in
Panama.   The port of Nouadhibou in Mauritania faces direct com-
petition from Las Palmas and Dakar, both of which are substantially
more developed and offer many more attractions both in the ports and
in the surrounding infrastructure.
(c) Transshipment Role of Port
Both ports were intended primarily as transshipment ports in
which the majority of fish landed would move on to the world
market rather than being consumed locally.      In Panama, the tuna
were to be reexported after on shore storage but with no on shore
processing and the shrimps were to be reexported after minimal
processing such as heading,    peeling,  packing and freezing.     In
Mauritania, the demersal fish and the pelagic food fish were to
undergo only minimal processing, gutting and freezing, before being
reexported and the balance of the pelagic fish were to be processed
into meal and oil for reexport. Domestic consumption in both cases
was expected to be minimal.
(d) Port as Necessary but not Sufficient Condition
The appraisal for each of the two projects correctly recognized that
a new or expanded port was necessary to further expansion in the
fisheries sector, but both projects did not fully consider what
other investments or actions would be sufficient to assure further
development of the sector.
(e) Emphasis on Port Facilities and Administration
Both projects were handled by transportation units and both empha-
sized the design and construction of the physical facilities, port
tariffs and finances, and technical assistance and institution
building efforts in the area of port administration.
(f) Lack or Weakness of Sensitivity Analysis
In both projects, sensitivity analysis was not done or failed to
focus on the variables which would affect the decision of potential
port users to put into the port.

(g)  Limited Number of Fisheries Personnel
At the time of appraisal of both projects the Bank 'Group had
only limited personnel resources in the fisheries area and thus
the other staff associated with appraisal and supervision were
unable to develop a full understanding of the fisheries issues that
surrounded each project.      Even the limited fisheries expertise
within the Bank'Group was not used sufficiently.
5.        Among the areas where the two projects were in relatively sharp
contrast are the following:
(a)  Fisheries Policy
At the time of appraisal, Panama had a well defined fishery policy
and regulations covering the catching of the main domestic species
of shrimp.   There was no policy with regard to tuna, but none was
necessary since tuna are a highly migratory species and very few
were or are caught in Panamanian waters.     By contrast, Mauritania
had essentially no fisheries policy or regulations dealing with the
catching of the species indigenous     to Mauritanian waters.     The
country collected license fees but these were based only on gross
tonnage of the vessels and did not address catch levels.
(b)  Changes in Fisheries Policy
The Panama loan agreement contained a covenant requiring consul-
tation with the Bank prior to any significant policy changes that
might affect the viability of the project.     The Mauritania credit
agreement contained no such covenant.    There have been no signifi-
cant changes in policy in Panama, while in Mauritania the opposite
is the case.
(c)  Suitability of Physical Facilities
The physical facilities at Panama which were redesigned after final
engineering revealed that costs would be so high as to compromise
the economic viability of the project are not completely suitable
for one of the major intended purposes, docking of tuna seiners and
transporters. The facilities at Nouadhibou, as designed and built,
are fundamentally suitable for the intended uses.
(d)  Infrastructure
Panama provides all of the physical and institutional infrastructure
needed to service an international fleet.    By contrast, Mauritania
has very limited infrastructure, supplies and attractions.

II. IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND SUPERVISION
Identification and Preparation
6.        The Panama Fishing Port Project (Loan 1114-PAN)!! was originally
identified and prepared by an FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program mission which
visited the country in July and August of 1969.        At that time the mission
proposed construction of a new port with three broad objectives:         (a) the
regrouping at a new location away from central Panama City of the then
existing fisheries activities in the interests of environmental improvement
and of economy and efficiency; (b) the further development of Panamanian
fisheries activities (beyond the then existing shrimp fishery which was
already being exploited at or in excess of maximum sustainable yield); and (c)
the servicing of foreign fleets, and its diversion from existing transfer and
servicing operations from an anchorage near Taboga Island.
7.        In  pursuit   of  these  objectives,   the  identification/preparation
report envisaged a port that would provide shelter and service facilities for
240 shrimp trawlers, 25 large purse seiners, 10 small seiners, and 60 inshore
boats all based in Panama and for a number of international tuna vessels
operating in Eastern Pacific tropical water.       The facilities would include
unloading and service berths, freezing and cold storage plants, and a ship-
yard.
8.        While   the  identification/preparation   report  did  not  attempt  to
quantify the overall economic benefit or rate of return for the proposed
project, the annexes to the report contain estimates of savings in specific
areas.   For the then existing fleet, the report estimated savings in turn-
around time for shrimpers (which would be freed from their extreme dependence
on the tides in the Bay of Panama); in the shrimp processing plant operations
due to less tide dependence and less damaged shrimp; in fish reduction plants
due to improved quality of input; and in operating and maintenance costs of
the fleet.  Overall savings for the local fleet were estimated at $845,000 per
annum.
9.        In the area of production diversification and increase, the report
foresaw benefits from the partial change from headed shrimp frozen in boxes or
bags to the more valuable IQF (individually quick frozen) shrimp, from the
initiation of a scallop fishery (though only experimental fishing had been
done and the extent of the resource was not known); from canning of pelagic
1/   There have been two other audits relating to fisheries in Panama:
The Panama (First) Fisheries Project (Loan 784-PAN), Report No. 2578
of June 29, 1979 and Panama (Second) Fisheries Project (Loan 1398-PAN),
Report No. 4597 of 1983. The former project provided funds for 40
shrimp trawlers while the latter financed ten purse seiners for the
fishmeal industry, five new shrimp trawlers, rehabilitation of ten wooden
shrimp trawlers, relocation of shrimp processing plants to Vacamonte, and
certain other component.

fish (anchovy and thread herring); and from increased yield of the fish
reduction plants due to improved quality of input. The report made no overall
estimate of benefits for production diversification and increase.
10.       For the international tuna fleet, the report attempted to estimate
the rate of return on the proposed cold storage, but in doing so combined the
projected gross income of the cold store with revenues from the sale of fuel,
water and food and from loading and unloading, and maintenance and repair to
arrive at a total gross income to the port and/or concessionaire of $565,000
per annum.   Except for the cold store, no attempt was made to differentiate
among gross income, operating costs, cost of goods sold, income to the port as
opposed to concessionaires, and fees.
11.       Even though identification and preparation do not ordinarily include
detailed analysis or state of knowledge comparable to that which is included
in an appraisal, the deficiencies in the identification of the project and of
its potential benefits had significant effects on the evolution of the proj-
ect, on the analysis of the feasibility study and of the appraisal and on the
ultimate outcome of the project.     These deficiencies had particular impact
because fisheries systems and operations were not given detailed and equal
consideration after the initial stage of the project.        Several important
confusions occurred in these early stages.      Costs and expenses were inter-
changed as were benefits and gross income, and, with the exception of a brief
mention of the fixed and variable expenses of shrimp boat operation, the cost
structure and cash flow needs of the vessels that were to use the port were
virtually ignored.
Appraisal
12.       The appraisal report was prepared in March of 1975 without a formal
appaisal mission to Panama, but the audit concurs that the formal appraisal
mission should have been unnecessary, given the two preappraisal missions in
April and August of 1974 and the availability of the extensive consultants
feasibility study which had been prepared on the basis of the identification
report. In addition, a Bank staff member visited San Diego, California, for
discussions with representatives of the tuna fishery industry to solicit views
of this important group of potential users of the new port.
13.       Though the decision not to send a formal appraisal mission was
based to a large degree on the availability of the consultants' feasibility
study, the appraisal report makes significant departures from the estimates of
the study, particularly in the case of the traffic forecasts for the inter-
national tuna fleet.   These increases in the traffic forecast have proved to
be critical and the audit mission has found no substantiating documentation
for them in the project files. (The appraisal did, however, have a basis for
increasing the servicing calls estimate for the Japanese longline fleet, if
they could be induced to move from Balboa to Vacamonte for servicing.)      The
decision to substantially increase the traffic estimates appears to have been
based primarily on discussions with industry representatives without benefit
of documentary support.    The audit supports the view that industry input is

reduction plants due to improved quality of input. The report made no overall
estimate of benefits for production diversification and increase.
10.       For Lne international tuna fleet, the report attempted to estimate
the rate of return on the proposed cold storage, but in doing so combined the
projected gross income of the cold store with revenues from the sale of fuel,

- 7 -
important to the appraisal of a project such as this, but notes that prac-
tice ordinarily requires that careful analyses such as those used in this
feasibility study not be changed without hard evidence and further detailed
reviews.  The changes in projections, according to the Bank's regional staff,
were made only after consultation with various fisheries experts of the
Bank, of industry and of FAO and resulted in both reductions and increases
of traffic forecasts and that this conforms to standard Bank practice. It was
also assumed at appraisal that the tuna transshipment facilities at Taboga
would be closed and thereby forcing some or all of this business to transfer
to Vacamonte. The regional staff thus consider that transshipments which are
now occurring at Taboga should be included with those at Vacamonte to arrive
at an appropriate total for comparison with the appraisal forecast.     On that
basis the forecast at appraisal for Vacamonte when compared with the combined
actual operations at Taboga and Vacamonte is seen to be of the same general
magnitude.   The assumption with regard to the closure of Taboga was not,
however, reflected in any of the agreements related to the project, although
it was mentioned in the appraisal report (para. 5.05) that the Government
planned to discontinue the transshipment operations at Taboga when Vacamonte
was finished. When the Government tried to implement this intention, the tuna
industry protested and threatened to stop operations in Panama entirely and
the Government thereupon reconsidered its stand.   It is also possible that if
Taboga had been closed only some of its traffic would have moved to Vacamonte.
The relative attractiveness of Vacamonte vis-a-vis its competitors remains a
current issue and needs to be studied in detail.
14.       The feasibility study had estimated that no California based tuna
seiners would use Vacamonte, while the appraisal allowed for 20 calls per
year.  The feasibility study estimated a high of 51 calls per year for trans-
shipment by purse seiners, while the appraisal estimated 122 calls per year.
The feasibility study estimated 100 calls per year for servicing of Japanese
longline vessels, and the appraisal trebled this to 300 calls per year based
on the 242 calls at Balboa reported by an industry group for 1973 and the 300
estimated by the same group for 1974.      The feasibility study used a total
transshipment tonnage of 44,390 tons per year (40,300 metric tons) by 1987 for
the benefit calculations, while the appraisal increased the annual tonnage to
64,500 tons per year for years 1987 and beyond.       All of these changes are
substantial and they had a significant impact on the apparent economic via-
bility of the project at the time of appraisal.     They do not appear to have
been based on additional data or detailed analysis.
15.       The appraisal report refers    to letters   from tuna vessel owners
declaring their intention to use the new port (appraisal para. 4.15).
References to such letters were also found in the project files, but the audit
has been unable to find copies of the letters themselves in Bank files, nor
has APN been able to locate copies.    Discussions with people who saw one or
more of the letters indicate that they were definitely not commitments and one
person described the letters as little more than vague expressions of in-
terest.   The project files show that there was consideration of the desira-
bility and feasibility of obtaining some degree of equity participation in the



- 8 -
port facilities, such as the cold storage, by one or more international
fishing  companies.    Such participation would have substantially increased
the prospects for success of the Vacamonte project and the lack of such
participation and the corresponding commitment to use the port has been a
major factor in the relatively poor performance of the port with regard to the
tuna fleet.
16.       Aside from the benefits to the Panamanian economy that the appraisal
estimated for the port and its potential users, the appraisal also allowed
benefits for changes in land values due to removal of the port and processing
plants from Panama City.    The land value benefits were in three categories:
the then current market value of the land that would be freed by the re-
location of shrimp processing plants and a boat repair yard to Vacamonte; the
presumed increase in value of the same land by virtue of the land being
available for a higher and better use; and the presumed enhancement in value
of surrounding land by virtue of the removal of the unaesthetic activities of
shrimp processing and boat repair.     The feasiblity study mentions the same
three categories of land value benefits, though at a lower level than the
appraisal, but includes only the market value and enhanced value of the freed
land as economic benefits of the project.
17.       The audit agrees that the current market value of the freed land
is a legitimate economic benefit of the project but questions the principle of
using a presumed enhanced value in the absence of both plans and funds to put
the land to a higher and better use.    The feasibility study raises a similar
question (para. 4.45 Vol. 4):    "... the value of the land released, provided
it is to be put to constructive use, may be considered as a benefit ..
(emphasis added). At the time of the appraisal in 1975, there were redevelop-
ment plans for the Maranon section of Panama City, as there are in 1982, but
there were no funds available then for the implementation of those plans and
there are none now.    The land and buildings formerly occupied by the shrimp
plants remain unused and the surrounding area remains essentially unchanged
and badly in need of redevelopment.      The use of enhanced land value as a
benefit would be appropriate when the higher value can be established by an
existing market or by imminent changes in the market, but not when the only
basis for the higher value is unfunded redevelopment plans with a low proba-
bility of implementation.     At the very least, the enhanced value benefits
should have been heavily discounted in the appraisal. These arguments are not
applicable in the same measure with regard to land released from use by the
shrimp industry outside the Maranon section.     This land, representing 90% of
the land and 75% of the land benefits, is located in areas where private
development had been occurring already and where it was reasonable to expect
to result in redevelopment without specific action by the public authorities.
However, development has not yet, in fact, occurred in these other areas.

port facilities, such as the cold storage, by one or more international
fishing companies.     Such participation would have substantially increased
the prospects for success of the Vacamonte project and the lack of such
participation and the corresponding commitment to use the port has been a
major factor in the relatively poor performance of the port with regard to the
tuna fleet.
16.       Aside from the benefits to the Panamanian economy that the appraisal
estimated for the port and its potential users, the appraisal also allowed
benefits for changes in land values due to removal of the port and processing
plants from Panama City.    The land value benefits were in three categories:
the then current market value of the land that would be freed by the re-
location of shrimp processing plants and a boat repair yard to Vacamonte; the
presumed increase in value of the same land by virtue of the land being

However, development has not yet, in fact, occurred in these other areas.

18.       A similar question arises in the case of the benefits from the
projected availability as a result of the project of deepwater shrimp species
of cabezon, fidel, and other new unnamed species.        Ihe appraisal and the
consultants' feasibility study include benefits for the production of 2,000
tons per year of the deepwater species while, at the same time, pointing out
that exploitation of these new species would require investment in specialized
processing equipment, investment in specialized fishing gear, investment in
larger and more powerful fishing boats, and Government of Panama action to
increase the number of shrimp fishing licenses and to increase the limitation
on vessel horsepower. The project files do not indicate that any such invest-
ment was imminent, nor is it provided in the instant project or the prede-
cessor Loan 784-PAN which was aimed at fleet replacement, not augmentation.
Not only were there no anticipated changes in Government regulation of fleet
size but the appraisal was based on maintenance of the status quo in these
regulations and even stated (para. 5.02) that a change would be considered a
basis for default of the proposed loan.
19.       Aside for the apparent absence of the necessary investment in
new facilities and equipment to exploit the new species and the apparent
absence of imminent change in Government policy and recommendations, the
forecasted increase in shrimp landings would also have required fundamental
adjustments in the market structure.    The new species were either unknown in
the United States or were known only through test marketing of similar spe-
cies.   The United States represents 97% of the Panamanian export market for
shrimp and the proposed production of the new species would have represented
only 1/2 to 1% of U.S. consumption.    The difficulties associated with market-
ing a new product were not fully considered and the perceived benefits were
not adjusted accordingly. A similar critique is applicable to the projection
made at appraisal that unheaded cabezon and fidel could be sold in Spain as a
substitute for more traditional shellfish in paella.
20.       At the time of appraisal the food fish catch was primarily (80% of
total landings) an incidental by catch of the shrimp vessels and fishmeal
vessels and totalled about 3,600 tons per annum in Panama Bay. The appraisal
estimated that, although landings by the shrimp and fishmeal vessels would
decline, some 26 new and larger food fish vessels would be built and would
catch fish at a rate sufficient to maintain a growth in landings of 5.5% per
annum.   Although the appraisal did not identify the financing source for
the new vessels, IDB was making a loan at approximately the same time as the
appraisal to finance expansion of the domestic Panamanian non-shrimp fishery
and that had this IDB project not fallen short of its objectives the use of
Vacamonte by Panamanian fishing vessels would have been more in accordance
with appraisal projections.    If IDB's financing was indeed to have been an
important element in the Bank's project, closer collaboration with IDB would
have been desirable. The resulting benefit stream in Annex 6 of the Appraisal
Report is based on the net value added per additional ton landed as estimated
by the feasibility study.     This benefit stream appears to be overstated in
that the net value added figure in the feasiblity study is stated in 1978
dollars and should have been deflated to 1975 dollars to be consistent with



- 10 -
the rest of Annex 6.    More importantly, however, the net value added appears
to be net of some, but not all, fishing costs.     Crew costs are not deducted
from the gross nor are capital costs, which are especially important in view
of the stated need for 26 new and larger vessels for which funding is not
provided in the project.
Supervision
21.       The project was supervised in nine supervision missions of which
6 were one person missions and 3 were two-person missions, and the average
duration of the missions was 4 days.      The amount of supervision appears to
have been adequate and appropriate to assure timely implementation of the
project with only minor delays.     All indications are that an atmosphere of
cooperation and mutual respect among Bank staff, APN, the consultants, and the
contractors was developed and helped to solve problems as they arose.
22.       The project was initiated, appraised,     and supervised in a ports
division of the Bank, a fact which probably explains that, with the exception
of the FAO staff involved in the identification and preparation, fisheries
expertise was absent from all but one of the Bank missions (a fisheries expert
was present on one of the preappraisal missions).        The lack of fisheries
expertise may explain the fact that during appraisal, implementation and
operation of the project there was inadequate attention to the organization,
operations and finances of the fishing enterprises and their effect on port
operations. Particularly in the case of the international tuna fleet, a more
extensive knowledge of fisheries economics and operations would have assisted
the economic analysis of the project, the evaluation of the feasibility study,
preparation of detailed design, and the interpretation of the information
obtained from the tuna industry. The mobility and freedom of action of
international fishing fleets, as contrasted with national domestic fleets,
means that the decision to use or not use a given port is based almost en-
tirely on economic and operational considerations, with the emphasis on the
former. Governmental policy can have little impact on such decisions and then
only when the policy is generally consistent with the economics.         In this
regard, international fishing ports also differ from most general cargo ports
where port activities are closely tied to the import and export needs of the
country or hinterland of the port, though a port with a high percentage of
transshipment cargo, such as Singapore, is quite analogous to an international
fishing port.
23.       Early in the supervision process, the detailed design indicated that
the actual cost of the port would substantially exceed appraisal estimates and
attempts were made to find economies.      (It should be pointed out that the
current procedure of having detailed design precede Board presentation reduces
the probabilty of this problem in current and future Bank projects).       Among
the economies selected was a realignment of the southwest corner of the
breakwater to save 90-100 m of length and a shortening of the eastern end of
the breakwater to save an additional 50-60 m in length.

former. Governmental policy can have little impact on such decisions and then
only when the policy is generally consistent with the economics.        In this
regard, international fishing ports also differ from most general cargo ports
where port activities are closely tied to the import and export needs of the
country or hinterland of the port, though a port with a high percentage of
transshipment cargo, such as Singapore, is quite analogous to an international
fishing port.
23.       Early in the supervision process, the detailed design indicated that
the actual cost of the port would substantially exceed appraisal estimates and
attempts were made to find economies.      (It should be pointed out that the
current procedure of having detailed design precede Board presentation reduces
the probabilty of this problem in current and future Bank projects).       Among
the economies selected was a realignment of the southwest corner of the
breakwater to save 90-100 m of length and a shortening of the eastern end of
the breakwater to save an additional 50-60 m in length.

24.       This decision may have, left the tuna berths exposed to swell and
wave action more than the original design contemplated and has added to the
unattractiveness of the port to the tuna industry.     It appears that when the
recommendation to shorten the eastern end of the breakwater was formulated,
the consultant reanaized the effect of swell and wave on the tuna berths and
concluded that vessel motion though increased would be within acceptable
limits.   However, there have been problems with vessel motion in the port as
observed by the audit mission and as reported by users (para. 29). The Bank's
regional staff believe, nevertheless, that suitability of Vacamonte for tuna
operations remains unaffected by the change in the breakwater.
III. PHYSICAL DESIGN OF PROJECT
25.       Discussions with persons in the tuna industry reveal a generally
negative view of the physical and operational characteristics of the Port of
Vacamonte.    The majority of those interviewed, when asked for an overall
impression of the port, described it as "a very nice shrimp boat port." While
further discussions generally revealed a slightly less critical view of the
port than is implied by this comment, it is, nonetheless, true that there is a
broad perception in the international tuna fishing community that Vacamonte
has serious shortcomings as a tuna fishing port. Discussions with persons in
the domestic shrimp industry reveal a very positive view of the physical and
operational characteristics of the port of Vacamonte. The port is well suited
to the needs of the shrimp fleet both in an absolute sense and especially in
contrast to the very unsatisfactory conditions that the fleet faced in Maranon
and Paitilla.
26.       The access channel to the port was originally dredged to a depth of
5.5 meters below mean low water, with maintenance dredging scheduled every
five years. Port users indicate that siltation may have reduced current (Fall
1982) channel depth to 5 meters below mean low water or less. A typical 1,200
tons tuna purse seiner has a loaded draft of 6.1 meters, and most of the tuna
carriers that call in Panama have drafts in the range of 6.8 meters to 7.1
meters.   The result is that both tuna seiners and tuna carriers can safely
enter or leave the port in the loaded condition only within two hours on
either side of high tide or roughly one-third of the time.     With the further
restriction that both captains and pilots prefer to avoid entering or leaving
port in darkness, the usable time for the channel drops to only about four
hours per day and presents a severe operational constraint to potential
users. When compared to the time and cost savings the port was intended to
offer the tuna fleet, as estimated in the appraisal, this constraint alone
makes the port unattractive. The audit concludes that the appraisal and the
feasibility study should not have selected a limited access channel without
adequately considering the operational and economic effects on the user fleet
and the resulting decline-in port, traffic.
27.       In addition to the fact that the design depth of the access channel
limited the operation of the port to a few hours a day for one of the most
important user groups, there also are indications either that siltation is



- 12 -
occurring at a greater rate than anticipated or that the hydrodynamics of the
port entrance are causing the dredged channel to "move."      The audit mission
heard of at least two instances where loaded tuna vessels touched bottom even
though they were in the marked channel at a time when the tide should have
allowed adequate clearance under the keel.     The knowledge of these incidents
in the industry is widespread and has served to further limit the accept-
ability of the port to the tuna fleet.
28.       At the closest point, the breakwater and the end of the tuna jetty
are less than 200 meters apart and the turning basin has an effective radius
of approximately 150 meters.    Tuna carriers have overall lengths of 120 m to
130 m and a 1,200 ton tuna seiner has an overall length of 68 meters.        The
turning basin is adequate to turn either a tuna carrier or a tuna seiner,
though barely so.   Both types of ships are usually equipped with bow thrust-
ers, which gives them the high maneuvarability needed in such a constrained
channel and turning basin, but difficulties still persist, especially in high
wind conditions. There have been reports of instances when tuna carriers have
had to back out of Vacamonte rather than attempt a turnaround.       The design
depth of the turning basin is 5.0 meters at mean low water, so the basin is
more tide restricted than the access channel. The audit concurs with the PCR
(para. 5.11) that the port design may be inappropriate for the vessels
that are the present users.     The audit also concurs that the size of tuna
vessels of both types has risen sharply, but notes that industry data and data
from the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission that were available at the
time of the feasibility study and the appraisal showed that the trend to
larger vessels was clearly established.
29.       As indicated in para. 24, the decision to shorten the eastern end of
the breakwater design has left the tuna berths nearly fully exposed to wind,
waves, and swell from the southeast quadrant.     According to some port users,
wave action at the tuna berths can be unacceptable even on calm days due to
the effects of tidal surge.     The audit mission received several reports of
extreme motions at the dock resulting, on various occasions, in a parted
mooring line, a ruptured pneumatic fender, and minor hull damage due to dock
impact and bow to stern collisions.      Observations during the audit mission
were limited and qualitative but tended to lend credence to such reports. The
mission noted, for example, that on a day when sea conditions were nearly
calm, a 1,200 ton tuna seiner at the dock was pitching with a two-foot half
amplitude at the forward marks.      However, the Bank's regional staff notes
that, based on the consultant's analysis, the amount of vessel motion was
considered to be within acceptable limits.
30.       Discussions with tuna industry personnel and APN personnel indicate
that pilotage was a problem during the early years of port operation.        The
problems centered on the time spent waiting for pilots, which sometimes
resulted in entry or departure delays of a day or more when combined with the
tidal restrictions noted above, and questions regarding the qualifications of
the pilots provided by the port.     Fleet port captains or captains who have
used the port several times in the past prefer to act as their own pilot, but
the poor pilotage reputation of the port has spread and has been one more

- 13 -
factor in limiting the use of the port by the majority of the international
tuna fleet.   Tug service is also a complaint in terms of the availability of
the one port tug and its adequacy.    It should be pointed out, however, that a
tug is not always required since nearly all of the tuna carriers and large
seiners are equipped with bow thrusters.
31.       There is a widespread belief that berth space in Vacamonte is
not readily available and that waits of one to a few days for berth space are
common.   In part, this belief is based on the fact that there are usually two
to six Cuban trawlers tied up at the tuna pier, but it is the opinion of the
audit mission that the perception of the importance of the Cuban fleet in
causing port delays is substantially greater than the reality.        This per-
ception is affected by the political views of the predominantely American ship
captains and tuna industry management.     Nonetheless, the trawler fleet does
contribute to port congestion and does limit to a small degree the availa-
bility of tuna berths. The question also remains whether the four berths that
were intended for the tuna trade were sufficient for the amount of traffic
foreseen in the appraisal.    For example, the data in Table 9 and Annex 7 of
the appraisal report indicate a year-round demand for 876 berthing days for
the four berths or an occupancy rate in 1987 of 60%.        As Table 3 Annex 1
shows, however, 80% of the tuna activity occurs in the first half of the year
so the occupancy rate would rise to 96% during this period.     The point to be
made here is not that a specific occupancy rate was built into the project,
but rather that the facilities provided were only marginally sufficient for
the traffic forecast.   Either the traffic forecasts or the facilities design
had to be suspect and time has shown that the traffic forecast was overly
optimistic.
32.       Some of those interviewed suggested that fish handling operations
at Vacamonte are actually slower than at Taboga, an island near Vacamonte
where tuna boats sometimes anchor to transfer their catch. Among other
reasons, this is caused by the fact that handling equipment at Vacamonte,
such as forklift trucks and cranes, is not dedicated to the tuna business.
The majority opinion, and the one endorsed by the audit, is that the time
required to transship a given quantity of fish is about the same at Taboga and
Vacamonte.    The 25% reduction in transshipment     foreseen by the appraisal
(Annex 7) thus has not been achieved and probably could not have been achieved
in view of the nature of the operation in which the         bottlenecks are the
movement of fish from the brine tanks to the deck of the seiner and from the
deck to the holds of the tuna carrier.
33.       The  facilities  provided  for unloading and servicing the shrimp
fleet as well as the shipyard appear to be well suited for their intended
purposes and efficiently operated.     The only congestion problems appear to
occur during the two month closure of the shrimp fishery when the anchorage
inside the breakwater is barely adequate to-accommodate the entire fleet. The
main problem here is not so much the ability to accommodate the shrimp fleet
but the task of placing the anchored vessels in such a way that they do not
encroach on the already limited turning basin for the tuna vessels.        Other
than this minor problem, which is more closely related to the tuna operations
than the shrimp fleet, the new port of Vacamonte has met all of the physical



- 14 -
needs of the shrimp fleet outlined in the appraisal report.       It is a well
sheltered, all tide port with adequate facilities and equipment for serving
the fleet.   Handling operations for shrimp are much improved over the situ-
ation that prevailed before the new port was constructed.
IV. POTENTIAL MARKET AND PROJECT BENEFITS
34.       The identification/preparation report, the consultants' feasibility
studies, and the project appraisal report for the Port of Vacamonte all
divided the intended or expected users of Vacamonte into four main groups:
(a) the shrimp fleet;
(b) the domestic purse seine fleet (for industrial fish);
(c) the artesanal fleet; and
(d) the international tuna fleet.
The last group can be further subdivided into two main subgroups:       (i) the
purse seine fleet and the reefers that carry seine caught tuna; and (ii) the
longline fleet and the reefers that carry longlined tuna.     While all of the
analyses of the proposed port project included consideration of the costs and
benefits associated with each user group or market segment, the international
tuna fleet had special significance.    The main port design alternatives that
were subjected to engineering and economic analysis were the development
options "with tuna" and "without tuna."    Indeed, the ultimate physical design
of the port and the estimated financial, feasibility of the project were both
heavily dependent on the planned usage of the port by the international tuna
fleet. As the PCR points out, the tuna related benefits of the project at
appraisal amounted to 31% of total benefits (present value at 10% discount
factor).
35.       Because of the recognized importance of the tuna related aspects of
the port, the preappraisal process included discussions with the tuna industry
in Panama and southern California. The appraisal itself contained a detailed
analysis of the economic incentive that a tuna operator would perceive when
comparing the new port of Vacamonte to the existing alternative of Taboga.
The audit strongly endorses this concept, since a port intended for the use of
an international fishing fleet can only succeed if the economics are such that
the port will attract the fleet in a free market environment. It is likewise
necessary to investigate and understand the operational needs of the fleet to
assure that the port design and operational plan are responsive to those
needs. While this procedure was followed in principle in the Vacamonte
project, the practical application of the principles appears to have been
inadequate and to have led to erroneous conclusions. In part, the problem may
have been due to incomplete knowledge of fisheries operations on the part of
the Bank and this may have prevented the Bank staff involved in the project
from gaining as full an understanding of the intended port uses as was neces-
sary. In any event, a sensitivity analysis of some of the assumptions about

needs of the shrimp fleet outlined in the appraisal report.       It is a well
sheltered, all tide port with adequate facilities and equipment for serving
the fleet.   Handling operations for shrimp are much improved over the situ-
ation that prevailed before the new port was constructed.
IV. POTENTIAL MARKET AND PROJECT BENEFITS
34.       The identification/preparation report, the consultants' feasibility
studies, and the project appraisal report for the Port of Vacamonte all
divided the intended or expected users of Vacamonte into four main groups:
(a) the shrimp fleet;
(b) the domestic purse seine fleet (for industrial fish);
(:c) the artesanal fleet; and

The last group can be further subdivided into two main subgroups:       (i) the

of the port and the estimated financiaL feasibility of the project were both
heavily dependent on the planned usage of the port by the internat'onal tuna
fleet.   As the PCR points out, the tuna related benefits of the project at

the Bank and this may have prevented the Bank staff involved in the project
from gaining as full an understanding of the intended port uses as was neces-
sary.   In any event, a sensitivity analysis of some of the assumptions about






- 15 -
the tuna fleet would have revealed that the economic viability of the port was
heavily dependent on a few important assumptions.     A more thorough investi-
gation of those assumptions might well have caused fundamental changes in the
tuna facilities if not the entire project.
36.       Annex 7 of the appraisal report compared the transshipment of tuna
via the new cold store at Vacamonte with the existing operations at Taboga.
This difference in costs of the users is not only a proxy of the benefits of
the project to the general economy., but the basis for gauging the attractive-
ness of the new facility to the potential users.      The role this difference
plays in the decision of operators to use the port can be measured by the
total expenditures a tuna ship makes during a typical port call, about
$250,000 or, based on a average load of 700 tons, about $360 per ton of fish
aboard.
37.       The quantified benefits to the tuna seiners using Vacamonte would be
as follows:
Benefit Category             Benefit in Dollars
Vacamonte vs. Taboga           per Ton Transshipped
Unloading time                     $10.68/ton
Time waiting for reefer             21.36
Servicing time                      16.00
Fuel costs                           2.00
Gross Benefit                   $50.04/ton
The costs of using the new port per ton transshipped were estimated
as:
Cold storage fee                   $26.50/ton
Extra handling charges              10.00
Port dues                            3.00
Transshipment fee                    7.50
Total Costs                     $47.00/ton
The resulting net economic benefit to be perceived by the owner of a tuna
seiner would be approximately $3.00 per ton of tuna transshipped. The corre-
sponding benefits to the tuna carriers were estimated at $2.00 per ton savings
due to faster turnaround time less $1.50 per ton in port charges for a net
economic benefit of $0.50 per ton of tuna transshipped. Thus, Annex 7 of the
appraisal report appears to demonstrate that the tuna industry would have an
economic incentive to use the new port versus the Taboga anchorage in the
amount of $3.50 per ton of tuna transhipped.    However, this apparent economic
incentive was based on extremely optimistic assumptions that should have been
suspect even at the time 'of appraisal and sensitivity analyses of some of the
assumptions would have revealed that relatively minor differences between the
assumptions and actual practice could seriously affect the prospects of the
new port for attracting the international tuna fleet.



- 16 -
38.       The $3.00 to $3.50 saving per ton in using Vacamonte was achieved
by a combination of savings and increased expenses most of which individually
were much larger than the net saving of $3.     A miscalculation in any one of
these areas was likely to affect the net savings in a major way.        Thus the
estimated savings on unloading time were based on the assumption that special
handling equipment (undefined in the appraisal report or the consultant's
report) and a cold storage would decrease unloading time by 25%.        Based on
discussions with sources in the industry and direct observations of transship-
ment operations at the Taboga anchorage, the audit mission is unable to
establish a real basis for this assumption since the critical path in the
transshipment operation is usually the movement of fish from the brine wells
to the deck of the tuna seiner and this would be unaffected by the new port.
In fact, current users of both the Taboga anchorage and the Vacamonte facili-
ties report no significant difference between the two in the time to unload a
seiner. Some operators even contend that the operation is slower at Vacamonte
because of the dependence on port equipment which has some competing uses and
other delays associated with port administrative practices.     A consideration
of the sensitivity of the total economic incentive to the seiner operators of
this one item in the calculation would have revealed that the savings at-
tributed to this item were three and one-half times greater than the total
estimated economic incentive. A perceived reduction in time savings of only 7
hours per voyage would negate the economic incentive to use Vacamonte (all
other things being equal) in the eyes of a tuna seiner operator.
39.       Similarly, the estimated cost saving associated with reducing the
time that a seiner would be waiting for a reefer was seven times greater than
the total projected net benefit to a ship for use of the port.          The cost
saving was based on an assumption of a reduction of two days in waiting time.
In discussions with ships' agents, fleet managers, tuna cannery representa-
tives, and ship captains, the audit mission found no individuals who could
recall when waiting for reefers at Taboga was a serious or significant prob-
lem.   On the contrary, most of the tuna industry representatives interviewed
cited waiting time for berth space at Vacamonte as one of several reasons for
their continued preference to use Taboga.     It is not unlikely that the con-
sultants and Bank staff received more optimistic estimates from the industry
during the preappraisal and appraisal period, but the audit mission feels that
the very large difference between this one item of estimated savings and the
total economic incentive should have indicated considerably greater caution in
the benefit estimates than is evident in the project files.
40.       Further, the projected cost savings due to reduction in servicing
time is five times greater than the total net benefit to a ship (the algebraic
sum of various costs and cost savings due to using the port), so a relatively
modest overestimate in reducing the service time could negate the overall
incentive for use of the port.     Moreover, the audit mission feels that this
estimated saving was not realistic in that most, if not all, of the assumed
servicing activities (fuelling, provisioning, and minor repairs) could be
accomplished during the time spent waiting for a reefer (repairs to the ship's
brine system being an obvious exception).      Accordingly, it is conceptually
incorrect to credit the new port for savings both in waiting time and in

servicing time. There may thus have been some overlap of benefits and,
because of the relatively small amount of the total economic benefit, the
assumed overlap need not have been very substantial to call the tuna portion
of the project into question.
41.       The estimated reductions in fuel costs were based on the assumption
that fuel would be sold at Vacamonte at a lower price than at Balboa or
Taboga.   While the audit agrees that such a discount would have been a real
incentive for tuna vessels to fuel at Vacamonte, there appears to be no basis
for assuming that such a discount would actually occur.     At the time of the
appraisal, the 'Government of Panama did not have control over fuel sales in
Balboa and could not have forced an increase in prices in Balboa via preferen-
tial tax or otherwise. The new port plan did not include a pipeline from the
refinery or provisions for receiving fuel by sea so it was clear that fuel
would move to Vacamonte by truck, with a higher delivered cost than in Panama
or Balboa. The only way that fuel could be sold at a discount in Vacamonte
would be via some form of subsidy from the'Government or APN, and there is no
provision for such a subsidy in the project plan.       In fact, fuel costs in
Vacamonte consistently have been 1      - 1-1/2g per gallon higher than in
Balboa since the opening of the port, reflecting the higher costs of getting
the fuel to Vacamonte.
42.       With regard to the reefer vessels, Annex 7 of the appraisal report
estimates a cost reduction (before port charges) of $2.00 per ton of fish
transshipped due to faster turnaround time.     The audit mission can find no
basis for this assumed saving.    Waiting time savings arising from mismatched
arrival times of seiners and reefers have already been credited to the seiner,
so it is inappropriate to count those savings again here.       The only other
possible savings in time would be loading time for the cargo, but the new port
could only effect changes in the time to place the fish on board the reefer
while the time and effort involved in stowing it in the cargo holds, which is
the bottleneck, would remain unchanged.     Containerization of the fish would
result in faster turnaround time for the cargo vessels but this would have
involved substantial institutional changes in the tuna industry that were not
evident at the time of appraisal and have not occurred since.      Furthermore,
the port as designed was not large enough for most standard container vessels.
43.       It is clear that either substantial economic benefits or compelling
operational reasons were essential if the international tuna fleet were to be
induced to use Vacamonte. Inducements were the only means available to
promote use of Vacamonte as neither APN nor the'Government of Panama had any
means to force or coerce the fleet to move its operations from Taboga to
Vacamonte unless Panama was willing to risk driving this business to another
country.   The international tuna fleet is a wide ranging fleet and a given
vessel may operate anywhere from Indonesia to the West Coast of Africa over
the course of a year.    Panama offered and offers many advantages in location
and infrastructure for servicing and transshipment, but it is not the only
country that the fleet can use when it is fishing in the eastern tropical
Pacific. Because of this, it would have been risky in the extreme to shut the
fleet out of Taboga as a means of moving the business to Vacamonte. The fleet
thus would only move for substantial economic or operational reasons and the
preceding paragraphs demonstrate that the operational or economic advantages
to the fishing operators were, at best, slight and, more likely, negative.

44.       The audit recognizes that many facts surrounding the operational
conditions at Tabogo and Vacamonte are unclear.       Based on observations at
both sites as well as interviews with users, the audit bases its analysis on
the following facts which are deemed true today and probably applied equally
at appraisal:
(a)  Taboga is a well sheltered and secure anchorage that is usable
for transshipment at essentially any time during the year;
(b) Ship-to-ship transfer of frozen tuna using ships gear is a rela-
tively simple, efficient, and economical operation with no unusual
hazards to the ships, the cargo, or the personnel involved.
(c) The limiting factors in the transfer operation are the movement
of fish from the brine wells to the deck of the seiner and the later
movement of fish from the deck of the reefer to the holds.         The
ship-to-ship transfer itself is not critical.
(d) The arrangement of deck machinery and equipment on most tuna seiners
is such that fish should, and in some cases must, be unloaded over
the port side of the vessel.     When the reefer is on anchor, the
seiner can easily maneuver to tie up bow-to-bow on the starboard
side or bow-to-stern on the port side to align any hatch on one ship
with any other on the other ship.
(e) None of the operations or maneuvers at Taboga are tide-dependent.
(f) Experienced transshipment personnel are readily available at Taboga.
(g) Travel to and from Taboga from the mainland is an inconvenience
but not a serious problem.      There is commercial service between
Panama and Taboga.
(h) There is enough flexibility inherent in the operations of both
reefers and seiners that unusable dead time while one vessel waits
for the other is rare.
(i) A vessel calling at Panama to transship tuna normally will also
want provisions, fuel, and minor repairs, and the crew will take a
few days of shore leave.    All of the in port operations, including
maneuvering, can be done with a skeleton crew (in some cases a shore
based crew), so the order in which these tasks are accomplished can
be varied.
These facts and the foregoing analyses suggest that the operational disad-
vantages of Taboga versus a new port at Vacamonte appear in hindsight to have
been greatly overstated. It is possible that the consultants, the Bank and
the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program too easily accepted the statements and

opinions of industry sources and did not scrutinize those opinions and state-
ments carefully enough in the light of hard data and statistics.     It is also
likely that industry sources, innocently or otherwise, exaggerated the need
for a tuna po;t at Vacamonte and the problems at Taboga. Likewise, the audit
mission recognizes that the opinions and statements it has received from the
tuna industry regarding Vacamonte and Taboga also must be treated with cau-
tion. Nevertheless, the conclusion seems reasonably established that benefits
were projected which were unlikely to occur or which were likely to be sig-
nificantly less than estimated.
V. USE OF PROJECT FACILITIES
45.       The overall port activities associated with the domestic shrimp
fishery are at or near the levels projected by the appraisal, according to
data supplied by APN and others.      This information appears to differ from
information available at the time of the PCR, which found a 19% reduction in
the anticipated catch of traditional species and a 60% reduction in the catch
of cabezon and fidel.    Current (Fall 1982) records of APN show 4,679 shrimp
vessel calls in Vacamonte in 1981 (Table 1) and total shrimp landings in
1981 of 7,650 metric tons with no breakdown by species available. The Direc-
torate of Marine Resources of the Ministry of Commerce and Industries shows a
total of 6,850 metric tons of shrimp landed in 1981 and, because of errors and
inconsistencies the audit mission has found in APN data, the audit finds the
Marine Resources data to be more credible.
46.       This total of 6,850 tons of shrimp is 93% of the total projected
by the appraisal.    Traditional species are at 97% of the level projected by
the appraisal while cabezon and fidel -landings in 1981 were at 90% of the
levels. Moreover, 1981 landings of traditional species of shrimp are somewhat
below the levels achieved in past years.     The deepwater fishery for new and
unnamed species has not materialized and there are no indications that it
will.   Likewise, discussions with persons in the industry tend to indicate
that future growth in landings of fidel and cabezon is unlikely and that some
contraction may occur due to the withdrawal from the fishery of a major
operator.   The traditional species remain at or beyond maximum sustainable
yield levels, so the overall prospects for the shrimp fishery and its activi-
ties in the port of Vacamonte are for a continuation at about current levels
at best, with the possibility of a near term decline of 5% to 15% in the worst
case.
47.       All of the shrimp processing plants that were to be relocated to the
port have completed their move and, with the addition of some new equipment
and the consolidation of the industry into a smaller number of more efficient
operators, the industry appears to have benefited from the project.         The
nature of the processing and the products has not changed significantly since
appraisal.   The primary products are still peeled and unpeeled tails and the
main operations are still grading, washing, hand peeling, hand packing, and
freezing.  Machine peeling, breading, and individual quick freezing have not



- 20 -
developed. Shrimp processing workers are still drawn mainly from Panama City
and are transported to and from Vacamonte in company buses. The audit mission
could not obtain firm employmenmt statistics, but industry discussions indi-
cate that labor costs are up, partially because of the transport costs and
incidental lost time, and overall employment in the industry is down, par-
tially because of the higher efficiency of the new plants at relatively
unchanged production levels.
48.       The coastal fishery foreseen by the appraisal did not materialize.
Information supplied by APN indicates a total landing of incidental catch by
the shrimp fleet in Vacamonte of only 150 metric tons in 1981, less than 5% of
the amount foreseen by the appraisal.       The data indicate no ship calls
generated by the coastal fishery and the fish market in the port area has not
developed.   The appraisal projected that the new coastal fishery would be
generated by a project which was concurrently going forward with finance from
the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) for the addition of some 90 vessels
to the local fishing fleet.   A final report for this project will be prepared
in several months but it appears that only some of the new vessels were
actually built. While it was always understood that most of the new vessels
would not be based in Vacamonte, a few would have been using this port but
were diverted to Balboa once that harbor became available after the Panama
Canal Treaty.    The appraisal estimated that 26% of the discounted present
value (at 10%) of the benefits of the port project would flow from this
fishery and estimated an average annual growth rate in this sector of 14.6%
over the 25-year economic life of the project as contrasted to the estimated
benefit growth rates of 1.4% in the shrimp sector and 2.2% in the tuna sector.
(In fact, the benefit streams of Annex 6 of the appraisal report are assumed
constant after 15 years so the corresponding average annual growth rates
during the years of assumed growth are even more disparate: 2.4% for shrimp;
3.6% for tuna; and 25.5% for coastal fisheries.) Because of the high growth
rate of coastal fishery benefits, the appraisal showed coastal fishery bene-
fits exceeding shrimp fleet benefits by 1988, shrimp processing benefits by
1991, and tuna industry benefits by 1993. These benefits were also overstated
because they were not reduced by the costs of the vessels or by full produc-
tion costs.   It is concluded that possible benefits from the coastal fishery
were seriously overestimated and that the project failed and will continue to
fail to meet projection levels. More detailed examination of the requirements
of a coastal fishery would have been helpful as well as closer coordination
with IDB to ensure that the coastal fishery would grow as projected.
49.       The actual level of port activity due to the international tuna
fleet is difficult to determine with certainty because the data supplied by
APN are not internally self consistent.    In part this may be due to errors in
compiling the data, but the larger and more fundamental problem for APN is the
apparent lack of a data gathering and reporting system sufficient to the
operational and investment planning needs of the port.      As an example, the
records of ship calls at Vacamonte and Taboga are frequently commingled since
both the port and the anchorage are under the same administration. The
inability to accurately separate ship calls in the port from ship calls in
Taboga anchorage causes obvious problems in assessing the level of port
activity and the need, if any, for further expansion of the port.

Taboga anchorage causes obvious problems in assessing the level of port
activity and the need, if any, for further expansion of the port.

50.       Table 2 indicates that 40 tuna seiners called at the Vacamonte tuna
berths in 1981 and 27 in the first eight months of 1982.     APN records also
show only 6,857 tons of tuna unloaded or transshipped in Vacamonte in 1981 and
7,123 tons in the first eight months of 1982 for an implied average catch of
only 209 tons per vessel, a figure that is extremely and uncommonly low
for the international seiner fleet.    The data for the cold storage activity
(Table 3) show only ten parcels of fish placed in storage in the first eight
months of 1982, so it is likely that the majority of tuna vessel calls to
Vacamonte were for service or fuel only and not for unloading of fish (though
Table 4 shows that even fuel sales were light because of the high cost). This
conclusion is consistent with reports from the industry and observations of
the audit mission which indicate that most of the seiners which call at
Vacamonte have already unloaded their catch at Taboga.
51.       Table 5 shows the vessel calls and transshipment tonnages for
Taboga over the period 1968-82 as reported by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission and APN.    It is significant that the level of transshipment in
Panama (Taboga and Vacamonte) is at or near the levels projected by the
appraisal, an indication that the basic economics of transshipment have not
changed. Equally clear, however, is that the economics of using Taboga remain
far more attractive than using Vacamonte.
52.       The indication that overall tuna activity in Panama is following
projection must be treated with caution in future planning. The tuna industry
is in the midst of some fundamental readjustments that could bode ill for
Panama in the future. The changes are in the three areas of economics,
politics, and the resource.  The fleet has overbuilt and overcapitalized and,
in combination with fuel price escalations and the resource problems, the cost
of catching fish and the resulting consumer price have risen to the point that
consumer demand in the major U.S. market has levelled off and started to
decline. The political problems of jurisdiction over fishing grounds within
200 miles of coastlines has caused the virtual collapse of the Inter-American
Tropical Tuna Commission as a regulatory and conservation body and has led to
the so-called "tuna war" between the United States and Mexico in which U.S.
flag boats are regularly seized by Mexico and the U.S. has placed an embargo
on all Mexican caught or processed tuna.    The eastern Pacific stock of the
most valuable species, yellowfin, shows signs of overfishing and depletion in
a steadily declining catch per unit of fishing effort.   The overall result of
all of these related factors has been a trend towards the western and southern
Pacific fishing grounds. Should the trend continue, it is possible that tuna
activity in both Taboga and Vacamonte could decline significantly.
53.       As shown in Table 1, the number of calls to Vacamonte by trawlers,
primarily Cuban flag, has exceeded the number of calls by tuna vessels in 1981
and 1982. Though a breakdown of port revenues from the two types of business
is not available from APN, the qualitative indications are that the port
income from a trawler call is substantially less than from a seiner call.
Nonetheless, the higher number of calls by trawlers and the longer stay per
call make the trawler fleet an important port user group.        The relative
importance of this group to the port may increase in the future as tuna
activities move westward and as more large trawler fleets move into the



- 22 -
southeast Pacific. In particular, the audit mission received reports that the
Cuban fleet may increase its east Pacific activities and several east European
countries such as Poland, Bulgaria, and Russia have plans for major fishing
efforts off the west coast of South America in coming years.     It is important
to recognize that the fishing fleets of these nations are traditionally nearly
self sufficient and make few port calls away from home and then for only
limited periods and limited purposes such as crew rotation.       Fuel and pro-
visions purchases and repairs and maintenance in foreign ports are kept to an
absolute minimum and the amount of money spent in port by any one ship is
usually relatively small, but the potential number of vessels could make
trawler servicing an increasingly important source of revenue.
54.       There has been essentially no port activity due to Japanese longline
vessels. The appraisal did not project any transshipment calls by Japanese
vessels and this is consistent with the reported traditions and practices of
the industry. Nonetheless, the cold store as constructed has one of the three
1,000 ton chambers for the much lower temperature required only by longline
fish intended for the Japanese domestic market. (Seine caught fish are
intended for canning and have less stringent quality standards.)      The lower
temperature capability of the central chamber raised the capital costs of the
cold storage for no apparent purpose.     Japanese vessels that call in Panama
continue to use Balboa for fuel, provisions and crew shore leave in part
because the type of fuel they use is not currently offered at Vacamonte. Even
if it were, however, the transportation cost would make it more expensive from
Balboa, and lower service costs would be the only inducement for the Japanese
fleet to use Vacamonte rather than Balboa.
VI. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF PROJECT
55.       The financial performance of the port of Vacamonte for 1979 through
June of 1982 is summarized in Tables 6 and 7 which correspond to Tables 4 and
5 of the PCR. There are major differences between the data presented here and
the data of the PCR, some of these differences and the consequent variations
in analyses simply are due to the fact that the audit is based on later data
than the PCR.    It is also clear that the income statements of the PCR are
for all of APN, including Cristobal and Balboa, and the Trans-Isthmus Railway
and not just for Vacamonte and thus are not a realistic representation of the
performance of this project.     The balance sheets in the PCR probably also
include carryover from the ports of Cristobal and Balboa and the railway (e.g.
how could accounts receivable rise $1.3 million in 1979 and another $5.4
million in 1980 when the port did not open until late 1979 and gross revenues
in 1980 were only $2.2 million?). Tables 6 and 7 contain data supplied by APN
for the Vacamonte cost/revenue center only and are considered to be a better
basis for assessing the financial performance of the project even though they
still include costs and revenues for Taboga as well.
56.       Inauguration of the port was in August of 1979 with limited use
of the tuna facilities. The shrimp processing facilities became available in
mid-1980 and 1981 was the first full year of operations.      As Tables 6 and 7
show, the financial performance in 1981 and the first half of 1982 has been
poor. Operating losses have been $1.1 million and $0.3 million respectively

Cuban fleet may increase its east Pacific activities and several east European
countries such as Poland, Bulgaria, and Russia have plans for major fishing

to recognize that the fishing fleets of these nations are traditionally nearly

VI. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF PROJECT
55.       The financial performance of the port of Vacamonte for 1979 through
June of 1982 is summarized in Tables 6 and 7 which correspond to Tables 4 and
5 of the PCR. There are major differences between the data presented here and
the data of the PCR, some of these differences and the consequent variations
in analyses simply are due to the fact that the audit is based on later data
than the PCR.    It is also clear that the income statements of the PCR are

and not just for Vacamonte and thus are not a realistic representation of the

how could accounts receivable rise $1.3 million in 1979 and another $5.4
million in 1980 when the port did not open until late 1979 and gross revenues
in 1980 were only $2.2 million?). Tables 6 and 7 contain data supplied by APN
for the Vacamonte cost/revenue center only and are considered to be a better
basis for assessing the financial performance of the project even though they
still include costs and revenues for Taboga as well.
56.       Inauguration of the port was in August of 1979 with limited use
of the tuna facilities. The shrimp processing facilities became available in
mid-1980 and 1981 was the first full year of operations.      As Tables 6 and 7
show, the financial performance in 1981 and the first half of 1982 has been
poor. Operating losses have been $1.1 million and $0.3 million respectively






- 23 -
while net losses are $2.6 million and $1.1 million.       The working ratio of
expenses as a percentage of income is well over 100 and shows no signs of
substantially improving.    The balance sheet shows extreme weaknesses, with
current liabilities at three times current assets and current accounts payable
over 50 times greater than cash.
57.       Because of the performance indicated by Tables 6 and 7 for Vaca-
monte, the audit disagrees with the financial performance conclusions of the
PCR (PCR Paras. 4.07 and 4.08).     The audit finds that the port is not now
profitable and is not likely to become profitable in the foreseeable future,
particularly given the current and projected situation in the international
tuna market. The audit agrees that the higher depreciation charges have had a
negative impact, but the port would not meet appraisal cash flow estimates in
any case since it shows, and will probably continue to show, an operating loss

58.       Because of the poor financial performance of the port and the
likelihood that it will continue, the borrower will be in technical violation
of two covenants of the Loan and 'Guarantee Agreements.    It must be stressed,
however, that these technical violations do not arise from a lack of per-
formance by the Borrower or its personnel but rather from the fact that the
level of port activities is significantly below the expectations at the time
of appraisai of all parties to the project.     The audit agrees with the PCR
that most covenants requiring action by the Borrower have been met. The
covenants which will not be met are primarily financial performance covenants
which the audit mission feels were predestined to difficulty if not failure at
the time of appraisal. They are:
(a) 5.04 of the Loan Agreement
The June 1982 income statement makes it clear that the port will
not achieve a 7% annual rate of return in the second full fiscal
year of operation and is unlikely to achieve a positive rate of
return in the near future. Likewise, it is unlikely that the
Borrower will be able to pay a 3% return to the Guarantor. Section
5.04 requires the Borrower to set port tariffs at levels sufficient
to meet the above objectives, but no realistic tariffs could accom-
plish that at current and projected traffic levels.
(b)  5.05 of the Loan Agreement
For the same reason, no reasonable tariff level would permit
full cost recovery and reasonable returns on net fixed assets.
The audit notes that APN has undergone a fundamental transformation since
appraisal of the project with the assumption of many new duties as a result of
the Panama Canal Treaty and with an increase of staff from several hundred to
several thousand persons.    The Bank has made significant contributions in
helping APN take on its enlarged role.

59.       The PCR recalculates the ERR for the Vacamonte project at 7%; the
shrimp facilities show an ERR of 8% and the tuna facilities of 2%.       The PCR
notes that had the costs remained at their original level, the ERR would have
risen to 10%.   On the other hand, the ERR would have been significantly lower
than 7% had shrimp prices not gone up, had ancillary facilities near Vacamonte
not grown and had Cuban trawlers not made use of the port, all events which
were unforeseen at appraisal.     The ERR may also be somewhat reduced because
some of the cost of relocating the shrimp plants (some part of about US$3
million equivalent total cost, partly financed by the Panama Second Fisheries
Project, Loan 1398-PAN) has not been included in the cost stream of the
Vacamonte project and because the costs of the vessels for the coastal fishery
(partly financed from an IDB loan) have not been included either.
60.       The project represented a complex of several elements and partici-
pants and it required the establishment of new markets and new production
systems. It also depended on interacting business and investment decisions by
a number of private, public and international agencies and individuals.       The
project made only limited attempts to ensure that the parallel action on which
it depended would actually be undertaken and more active intervention in this
regard would probably have been useful.        This is particularly applicable
in regard to the coordination between the various fisheries projects made by
the Bank in Panama two of which were the concern of the Bank's agricultural
group while the third (the project under audit) was under the Bank's trans-
portation group. It also applied to the activities of the World Bank Group as
a whole and the IDB in the Panama fisheries sector.        However, the inherent
complexity of this scheme may have limited the scope for this sort of action
and under these circumstances the investment analysis would better have used a
very conservative valuation of benefits to protect the project outcome against
the inherent risks of the project's design.     Had this been done, the project
might well have been redesigned so as to keep its total costs within much
lower bounds.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
61.       The project proposed removal of shrimp landing and associated
processing facilities from the central area of Panama City to a new location
about 30 km away. It also intended to provide other fisheries related instal-
lations,including berthing and storage facilities for tuna vessels, berthing,
storage and marketing facilities for artesanal and larger scale fisheries to
supply the local market and ship servicing facilities for all these vessels
and for seiners which supply several Panamanian fish meal plants. The project
was built quite expeditiously and included all the foregoing facilities.
However, it was somewhat redesigned and there were significant cost overruns.
The project also resulted in the establishment of an effective port authority
and the Bank made significant contributions when that authority was greatly
expanded to assume enlarged responsiblities after the Panama Canal Treaty.

62.       While the Panamanian shrimp fleet is using the harbor and associated
facilities as anticipated, other uses have not developed in accordance with
projections. Most importantly, use by tuna vessels is very low and the
fishery for the local market has not developed.     however, some international
trawlers (notably from Cuba and East European countries) are calling at
Vacamonte, a use that was not foreseen at appraisal. The net effect of these
developments is a substantial reduction in benefits and a reduction of the ERR
to about 7% and poor financial performance. The economic and financial
performance of the project will continue to be poor unless the international
trawler fleet increases its use of Vacamonte to replace the major shortfalls
in use by the international tuna fleet and by domestic fishermen (other than
shrimpers).
63.       The overestimate in potential use of the harbor resulted from
weaknesses in the economic analysis of the identification report which were
carried over into the appraisal. The analysis overestimated potential
fisheries resources and gave inadequate appreciation to the factors influ-
encing the choice of fishing harbors by fisheries operators.         Particular
failings included:
(a) Shortening the eastern end of the breakwater as a cost saving design
change; this problem, coupled with other unfavorable aspects of
Vacamonte for tuna vessels has helped to compromise the suitability
of the port for the tuna industry even though the Bank's regional
staff believe that the suitability of Vacamonte for tuna operations
remains unaffected by the change in the breakwater.
(b) The depth and dimensions of both the access channel and the turning
basin; as built, they are ample for the shrimp fleet but barely
adequate for the tuna fleet, because of the resulting operational
constraints on the tuna fleet and the economic disincentive, the
port design is inappropriate for this user group.
(c) The acceptance by the Bank and APN of informal verbal assurances of
the tuna industry concerning the need for Vacamonte, its probable
utilization and the problems of using Taboga; the project design and
projection of benefits depended heavily on verbal reports that
should have been more carefully scrutinized and supported by docu-
mentary evidence.
(d) The analysis of the economic incentive for users of Taboga to switch
to Vacamonte, including the omission of a sensitivity analysis of
the most important variables; such a sensitivity analysis would have
cast severe doubt on the economic viability of the entire project
and, at the least, would have significantly altered the design.
(e) Too optimistic estimates of growth potential in the coastal fishery
and overestimate of resulting benefits; these benefits were a major
part of total projected benefits and were based on anticipating



- 26 -
substantial changes in Panamanian domestic fish consumption patterns
accompanied by rapid and sustained growth in catch.     The growth in
catch was predicated on a concurrent project for fishing vessels by
IDB, a project which might have made a greater contribution to the
Vacamonte scheme had the two projects been more closely coordinated
but which in any event attained only half its objectives and had
only minor effects on Vacamonte.
(f) The calculations of the economic incentive for tuna boats to
use Vacamonte; tuna vessel calls therefore are substantially below
appraisal estimates, as vessels continue to use the Taboga anchorage
in preference to Vacamonte.     Overall tuna activity in Panama is
following projections, but shifts in the international market and
fishing patterns suggest that this pattern may not continue.
64.       An important factor in the insufficiency of analysis at appraisal
and in inadequacies in supervision was the limited experience with fisheries
matters of the Bank unit handling the project.     This raises the issue as to
how fisheries projects can most suitably be handled by the Bank Group, how
such operations are best staffed and how various units in the Bank Group can
best collaborate on such projects.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PANAMA - VACAMONTE FISHING PORT PROJECT (LOAN 1114-PAN)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Panama, located at the crossroads of the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans, and of the North and South American continents, has an open economy
characterized by a sophisticated local and international business community
specializing in communications, banking and financial services. With a
population of about 1.8 million, growing at 3% per year, Panama had a per
capita GNP of some US$1,350 in 1979. Geographically, development has been
concentrated in the Pacific coastal region, which has many fertile valleys
providing excellent conditions for agriculture and cattle raising.
1.02       The agriculture, fishing and forestry sector accounts for about 16%
of GDP, and about one quarter of the value of the sector's output is derived
from the fishing industry. While, in terms of volume, the fishing catch is
dominated by anchovy, much of which is used in the production of fishmeal, the
greater part of the industry's value is provided by shrimp. The bulk of the
Panamanian shrimp catch is processed and exported, yielding a foreign exchange
income in 1979 of about US$44 million. Fisheries are an important source of
foreign exchange for the Republic of Panama. In 1979, shrimp exports accounted
for 16% of total FOB export revenues, while other fish products provided a
further 4%. Before the construction of the new fishing port at Vacamonte,
which is the subject of this Project Completion Report, the industry was
mostly located in the downtown area of Panama City where the scope for expan-
sion and improved levels of efficiency were severely limited and where the
facilities had a negative impact on the urban area.
1.03      This was the first port project to be financed by the Bank in
Panama and the second project related to' the fisheries industry. Under the
first fisheries project (Loan 784-PAN), 23 old wooden shrimp trawlers were
placed by standard steel trawlers. To date the Bank has made 22 loans to
Panama totaling US$339.7 million (net of cancellations). Of these, 10 loans
for US$137.4 million, are fully disbursed (two for roads totalling US$13 mil-
lion; one for an airport project for US$20 million; three for agriculture
totalling US$4.4 million, three for power for US$76 million and one for ports
for US$24 million). Ongoing operations include two projects for livestock
credit, one for fisheries; 1/- one for development of tropical trees; two for
development banking; three in the power sectors (for generation, transmission
and distribution); a project to support energy planning and petroleum explo-
ration; one to help develop the water supply and sewerage sector, one for
highway maintenance, and a loan for the Colon Urban Development Project. The
most recent loan, for development banking, was approved by the Executive
Directors in March 1981.
1.04      This Completion Report on the project supported by Loan 1114-PAN
of 1975 is based on information obtained from the (i) LAC Information Center,
(ii) the Appraisal Report (Report No. 629a-PAN), (iii) Supervision Reports,
(iv) Quarterly Progress Reports, (v) the Draft PCR prepared by the National
Port Authority (APN), and (vi) information collected during a mission to
Panama in March 1981.

II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01      The initial identification of the project occurred as a direct
result of the work of a FAO/World Bank cooperative program which prepared
a fishing project for Panama in 1969. This program recognized the potential
for the development of the fishing industry in Panama but concluded that
its expansion was seriously hampered by the lack of adequate port facilities
on the Gulf of Panama. Consequently it was recommended that high priority
be given to the construction of a fishing port and US$400,000 were included
in the World Bank Loan 784-PAN (para 1.03), to finance a feasibility study of
a new fishing port. Following pre-feasibility assessments of alternative
sites, it was concluded that the most appropriate location for the proposed
port would be Punta Vacamonte, some 27 kilometers from Panama City (see
map).
2.02      The feasibility study was carried out by a consortium of Panamanian
and British consultants appointed by the Government of Panama, in accordance
with World Bank procedures. The consultants' draft report was issued in
February 1974 and indicated that the economic and financial results of the
project would be poor. The economic rate of return (ERR) was then estimated
at 9% for a port without facilities for the international tuna fleet and 8%
with such facilities. The First Year Returns (FYERR) were 6.2% and 5.6%
respectively, and it was forecast that the operation of the port would have to
be heavily subsidized. During a Bank pre-appraisal mission in April 1974, the
draft report was discussed in detail with the Government and the consultants.
The view of the Bank mission was that a substantial revision of the economic
and financial analysis was required, and this was agreed by the Government and
their consultants following discussions with the mission. The principal
recommended changes were the following:
(a) Technical: modifications in the port layout which it was
considered would lead to a 20% reduction in project
construction costs;
(b) Economic: the elimination of benefits related to the
breading 1/ of shrimp due to restrictions by the Food and Drug
Administration on the importation of breaded shrimp into the
U.S. market; and the inclusion in the quantified benefits of
the market values of land in Panama City which, it was antici-
pated, would be released for immediate development following
the relocation of shrimp processing facilities at Vacamonte;
and
(c)  Financial:  changes in the Consultants' assumptions concerning
inflation, port charges and sources of funds for project
construction to reflect Bank guidelines.
2.03      Preliminary revisions by the consultants along the lines suggested
by the mission indicated that the ERR and financial results would improve
substantially. This was confirmed when the consultants' revised report
was issued in July 1974, and indicated a considerably higher ERR of about
1/   Essentially a cooking process involving the covering of the shrimp
with fried breadcrumbs.

20%. A second pre-appraisal mission visited Panama in August 1974 to
review the consultants' report and gather material for the Staff Appraisal
Report. Further modifications along the following lines were suggested:
(a) following discussions with the local FAO representatives,
the benefits relating to the exploitation of new deep water
shrimp species were halved as new information indicated the
extent of this resource to be substantially less than was
previously thought;
(b) based on information provided by Japanese tuna boat operators
and other industry sources in Panama, the number of service
calls by Japanese tuna vessels forecast by the consultants
was trebled;
(c) while the consultants had forecast no transshipment operations
by US west coast tuna seiners at the port, the mission
predicted that at least 20 per year would do so; this
prediction was based on the expected impact of higher fuel
costs which would make transshipment more desirable than
lengthy voyages by the seiners to processing plants in
Puerto Rico or San Diego;
(d) as a result of (b) and (c) the mission's estimate of demand
for transshipment and servicing facilities for tuna vessels
was about 60% higher than that of the consultants;
(e) the consultants' estimate of the benefits to be realized
from higher land values in Panama City was considered overly
conservative and adjusted upwards in accordance with
reported current land values in the areas concerned; and
(f) the consultants' estimate of benefits related to the food
fish industry were revised downwards to take account of the
input of a Cooperative Fisheries Project to be financed by IDB.
2.04      As a result of these changes, the relative importance of tuna-related
benefits to the viability of the project was considerably enhanced. In order
to confirm this situation, a visit was made in early 1975 by a Bank official
to San Diego, California where discussions were held with representatives of
the tuna fishing industry. Assurances were received from these representatives
that the forecast demand for tuna related facilities at Vacamonte was realistic.
2.05      It was felt that sufficient information had been gathered during
the two pre-appraisal missions of April and August 1974 to prepare the
Appraisal Report without the necessity of a further formal appraisal mission.
In accordance with Bank practice at the time, appraisal report estimates of the
project cost were based on the consultants' preliminary engineering studies
updated to March 1975 prices. The Report was issued in gray cover in April
1975.

2.06      The project as appraised had the following objectives:
(a) to promote the efficient operation and growth of the shrimp
industry in Panama by providing adequate port facilities;
(b) to provide improved transshipment and other services to the
national and international tuna fleets by installing a cold
storage plant on the mainland;
(c) to provide better facilities for inshore fishermen operating
in Panama Bay;
(d) to facilitate the improvement of the Maranon section of
Panama City by the removal of the fisheries industry from the
city; and
(e) to assist in developing the management capability of APN
through technical assistance and staff training programs.
2.07      In order to meet these objectives the principal components of the
project were:
(a) construction, at Punta Vacamonte, of a fishing port with a
protective breakwater, a dredged access channel, ten berths
for shrimp trawlers, four berths for tuna clippers, adequate
quays for berthing inshore fishing vessels and for servicing
trawlers, a ship repair berth and yard, buildings for shrimp
processing and tuna cold store plants, a fish market, adminis-
trative and other offices, storage areas, roads and utility
services within the port area;
(b) provision of consultant services for design and supervision of
construction; preparation of administrative and operational
procedures and cost accounting and budget control systems
required by APN and each of its ports; and
(c) a program for training the Port Authority's staff (to be
financed by UNDP).

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
A. Project Execution
3.01      Loan negotiations took place in Washington DC on February 25 and 26,
1975. The principal points of the Loan Agreement which were discussed and
modified were:






- 39 -
(a)  Appointment of Port Administrator (Section 4.03):
It was initially r.equired that the Port Authority consult the
Bank before appointing an administrator for the fishing port.
This was modified to say that the Port Authority would appoint
an administrator whose qualifications and experience would be
satisfactory to the Bank.
(b)  Fishing PQrt Advisory Committee (Section 4.04):
The Borrower sought and obtained a clarification to the
effect that the Committee's role would be purely advisory.
(c)  External Auditing of the Port Authority (Section 5.02):
The Borrower sought to change the requirement that only private
firms would be acceptable to the Bank as external auditors so
that the Comptroller General of the Republic of Panama would
also be an acceptable independent auditor. However, the
wording of the Loan Agreement was not changed though the
Bank did agree during discussion to subject the acceptability
of the Comptroller General to later review.
(d)  Maximum Debt of the Port Authority (Section 5.06)
APN's debt service coverage was to have been 1.5. This was
changed to 1.4 1/ at the Borrowers request.
(e)  Capital Investments by the Port Authority (Section 5.07):
The Bank initially required that APN would not carry out
any capital expenditure in excess of US$1 million for any
expansion before December 31, 1985, unless the financing plan
for such expenditure had been agreed by the Bank. This clause
proved to be the most difficult point in the negotiations.
It was finally agreed that, before undertaking capital expenditures
in excess of US$1 million during the period ending December 31,
1985, the Port Authority would satisfy the Bank that such
expenditures would not have a detrimental effect on the execu-
tion of the fishing port project or on compliance with the
Borrower's other obligations as stated in the Loan Agreement.
This meant that the Borrower should not incur any debt unless its net
revenues for the preceding final year (or later 12 month period which-
ever be the greater) are at about 1.4 times the maximum future debt
servicing requirement on all debt, including the debt to be incurred.



- 40 -
(f)  Access Road and Utilities (Section 3.02 of the Guarantee
Agreement):
The Bank initially required that the access road be completed
before the start of port construction, and that the infrastruc-
ture for the supply of utilities be completed before the completion
of the port construction works. APN wished to carry out these works
in stages in accordance with the necessities of construction. The
clause as agreed after negotiations said merely that these compo-
nents of the project would be implemented diligently and efficiently.
(g)  Timetable for Transfer of Shrimp Plants and Repair Workshops
Section 3.07 of the Guarantee Agreement):
The Bank initially required that the Government propose, not later
than December 31, 1975, a timetable acceptable to the Bank, for the
transfer of these facilities to the new port. It was agreed that
the Government would present a timetable, adequate to the needs of
the project, no later than June 30, 1976.
In retrospect, it is clear that these modifications had no detrimental
effect on the development of the project.
3.02      The project was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on
April 22, 1975. The Loan Agreement was signed on May 27, and the project
was due to become effective on August 25. However, the documents required
to meet the general conditions for effectiveness 1/ were found to contain
some errors. In order to enable the Panamanian authorities to make the
necessary corrections, the Bank acceded to a request from APN postponing
the deadline for effectiveness until September 25.
3.03      The loan amounted to US$24 million, which was to cover the esti-
mated foreign exchange cost of the project (US$20.5 million out of a total
Qf US$34.0 million including contingencies) and interest during construction
(estimated at US$3.5 million).
3.04      Contracts for the project construction and engineering may be
divided into three main groups: (i) consulting services, (ii) construction
of marine and harbor works, and (iii) construction and equipment of buildings
and other civil works.
(i)  Consultancy Services
3.05      There were two contracts for consultancy services:     one for the
detailed engineering and the other for the supervision of construction. 2/
The contract for detailed engineering was awarded to a consortium of three
1/   Mainly information concerning Panama's external debt obligations.
2/   The provision of services for administrative and operational procedures,
and cost accounting and budget control systems (para 2.07(b)) were
successfully carried out under UNDP-financed technical assistance.

(f) Access Road and Utilities (Section 3.02 of the Guarantee-
Agreement):
The Bank initially required that the access road be completed
before the start of port construction, and that the infrastruc-
ture for the.supply of utilities be completed before the completion
of the port construction works. APN wished to carry out these works
in stages in accordance with the necessities of construction. The
clause as agreed after negotiations said merely that these compo-
nents of the project would be implemented diligently and efficiently.
(g) Timetable for Transfer of Shrimp Plants and Repair Workshops
Section 3.07 of the Guarantee Agreement):
The Bank initially required that the Government propose, not later
than December 31, 1975, a timetable acceptable to the Bank, for the
transfer of these facilities to the new port. It was agreed that
the Government would present a timetable, adequate to the needs of
the project, no later than June 30, 1976.
In retrospect, it is clear that these modifications had no detrimental
effect on the development of the project.
3.02      The project was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on
April 22, 1975. The Loan Agreement was signed on May 27, and the project
was due to become effective on August 25. However, the documents required
to meet the general conditions for effectiveness 1/ were found to contain
some errors. In order to enable the Panamanian authorities to make the
necessary corrections, the Bank acceded to a request from APN postponing
the deadline for effectiveness until September 25.
3.03      The loan amounted to US$24 million, which was to cover the esti-
mated foreign exchange cost of the project (US$20.5 million out of a total
of US$34.0 million including contingencies) and interest during construction
(estimated at US$3.5 million).
3.04      Contracts for the project construction and engineering may be
divided into three main groups: (i) consulting services, (ii) construction
of marine and harbor works, and (iii) construction and equipment of buildings
and other civil works.
(i) Consultancy Services
3.05      There were two contracts for consultancy services:     one for the
detailed engineering and the other for the supervision of construction. 2/
The contract for detailed engineering was awarded to a consortium of three
1/   Mainly information concerning Panama's external debt obligations.

and cost accounting and budget control systems (para 2.07(b)) were

firms, two foreign and one Panamanian, in June 1975. One of the foreign firms
had been responsible for the project feasibility study. The contract was
signed without the Bank having had the opportunity to review and comment upon
the draft. Bank expressed its regret that in the case of the first contract
relating to the project, APN had overlooked their request to be given an
opportunity to comment before the agreement was executed. The Bank's view
was, firstly, that certain services normally expected of consultants in such
an assignment were not included; and, secondly, that the fee of US$1.5 million
was too high. 1/ The fee was based on 234 man-months of technical staff time
and this was thought to be excessive. After a series of discussions
between the Bank, APN and the consortium, the consultants agreed to carry
out certain additional services as part of their assignment and also to
reduce the fee by US$50,000 to US$1.45 million. Although the Bank still
considered the fee to be high, it approved the modified contract as this
was now understood to be acceptable to APN and the Government as a whole.
The higher than expected cost of consulting services did, however, affect
the disbursement rate. The provision in the Loan Agreement for consultant
services was US$1.1 million, and it was originally proposed to disburse it
at 60% of the total cost of such services. In order to ensure availability
of sufficient funds for supervision, the disbursement rate for consulting
services was reduced to 40%.
3.06      The contract for supervision and inspection was awarded to the same
consortium in November 1976 at a cost of US$2.4 million. On this occassion
Bank approval was sought and obtained before the agreement was executed. In
view of the substantially higher-than-expected cost of consulting services 2/
(a total of US$3.9 million vs. US$1.9 million as anticipated at appraisal),
it was decided in October 1976 to reduce the disbursement rate for this
component still further to 30% of total cost.
3.07      The performance of the consultants was in general satisfactory.
There was some slippage in the completion of the detailed engineering work
which delayed bidding procedures (para. 3.08). However, during the construc-
tion period, the consultants performed well and established a relationship of
mutual trust and confidence with Borrower and Contractor alike (para 3.11).
(ii) Marine and Harbor Works
3.08      Invitations to bid for the construction of marine and harbor works
were issued in accordance with Bank procedures in April 1976. Although 10
firms purchased bidding documents, six participated in the pre-bidding con-
ferences, and only one proposal was received - that of a Japanese consortium
of three contractors, on the scheduled bid-opening day (June 23, 1976). In
accordance with Panamanian law, the reception of only one bid necessitated the

costs of detailed engineering and supervision were not separate in
the estimates provided at appraisal.

cancellation of the first invitation, and the issue of a second. The same
Japanese contractor was again the sole respondant to this second invitation,
and after negotiations with APN this firm was awarded the contract on
August 27, 1976. The contract was approved by the Bank. The lateness of the
original bid documents and the need to re-bid resulted in a delay of about
eight months compared with the originally scheduled date for contract award
(Table 1). The amount negotiated with the Japanese contractor was quoted in
Yen and was for a total contract sum of US$27.5 million equivalent. Although
higher than the appraisal estimate of US$23 million (including physical and
price contingencies) this was within the revised cost estimate resulting from
the detailed engineering (para 3.15). After the contractor had been given the
order to mobilize, work began in October 1976.
3.09      The contractor maintained reasonably good progress and the works
were finally completed in July 1979, some seven months (15%) behind schedule
as at appraisal. This is considered satisfactory in view of the delay in the
bidding procedure mentioned above and a series of difficulties which presented
themselves during construction. The most serious of these occurred during the
Spring of 1977 when considerable damage was caused by very high waves over-
topping the breakwater. The contractor worked extremely hard to repair the
damage quickly. However, had the breakwaters been constructed first as origi-
nally programmed, the port area would have been better protected and the
damage suffered would have been much less. At a later stage, problems caused
by heavy swells delayed pile driving operations for about five months. However,
the contractor was able to make up for this at a later stage with the effective
protection provided by the breakwater, so that the overall program was only
marginally affected.
3.10     Another reason for delays were problems in the supply of re-
inforced concrete. The sub-contract for this was awarded to the only
Panamanian firm able to supply the material in the quality and quantity
required. Production setbacks frequently stemmed from the firm's acceptance
of orders from other clients which stretched its facilities beyond their
capacity.
3.11      Despite the above-mentioned delays and technical difficulties the
performance, during execution, of the Borrower and his consultants, and of
the contractor (for marine and harbor works), was good. An atmosphere of
confidence and close cooperation was established and maintained between the
Borrower and his consultants and between the latter and the contractor. This
atmosphere was exemplified by the fact that the consultants were given a wide
degree of discretion for taking decisions in the field without recourse to
formal exchanges of letters. As a result, the problems encountered during the
construction of this technically difficult project were quickly solved and the
works terminated within a satisfactory period of time.

(iii) Buildings, Other Civil Works and Equipment
3.12      Five contracts for the buildings and other civil works were awarded
in accordance with the procedures of the Bank, in June 1978, about six months
later than expected at appraisal. Although there was only one foreign bidder
(the Japanese marine contractor), the relatively small size of the jobs meant
that there was significant competition from local firms. The contracts were
for:
(a) the fish market, administration building, fire station,
and ships' agents' offices which was awarded to a
Panamanian firm (US$0.85 million);
(b) the shrimp processing plant, maritime and repair
buildings which was awarded to another Panamanian firm
(US$1.63 million);
(c) the tuna cold store, which was awarded to the same Japanese
contractor who undertook the marine and harbor works
(US$1.5 million);
(d) the water tanks, internal roads and other related
infrastructure, which was awarded to the same Japanese
contractor (US$1.85 million); and
(e) the electricity and telephone infrastructure, which was
again awarded to the Japanese contractor (US$1.35 million).
3.13      The construction program under these contracts did not proceed as
smoothly as that of the harbor and marine works. Lack of experience among
some of the contractors contributed to delays as did the difficulties encount-
ered by the consultants in coordinating the work of the different firms in-
volved. Problems were particularly severe in relation to the contracts for the
shrimp building and water supply infrastructure. In the case of the former,
the works were completed substantially behind schedule. Regarding the water
supply infrastructure, although the contractor applied himself unstintingly to
his task, his lack of experience in this type of work caused not only delays,
but also poor quality workmanship which on occasion necessitated costly
repairs. The completion dates for the works covered by these contracts are
shown in Table 1.
B.   Project Costs
3.14      A comparison between actual project costs and those estimated at
appraisal and at contract award is shown in Table 2. In order to ensure
comparability with the appraisal estimates, contract amounts and final costs
have been deflated to 1975 US dollars (1975 was the year of appraisal) using
the Panamanian wholesale price index, while the appraisal estimates have been
adjusted to include physical contingencies. The total project cost expressed
in constant 1975 US dollars, was US$40.1 million compared with US$26.5 million
at appraisal, an increase of about 51%. This includes items which were not



- 44 -
taken into account in the appraisal estimate, namely the cost of exchange rate
adjustments, the cost of land purchase and capitalized administrative and
supervision costs of the APN. Of these by far the most important was the
exchange rate adjustment, arising from the weakening of the US dollar against
the Japanese Yen, which amounted to an additional cost of about US$4 million
in current prices (US$3.3 million in constant 1975 prices). If these "extra"
items are excluded, then the final project cost is US$36.1 million, which is
36% above the appraisal estimate.
3.15      This difference has arisen from an underestimate at the time
of preliminary engineering rather than from significant design changes or
extra equipment acquisition authorized after the award of the contracts.
Most of the cost increase had already been identified during the detailed
engineering which preceded the bidding formalities. The only contractor
to bid for the marine and harbor works contract offered a quotation which
was in fact slightly below the revised estimate prepared by the consultants.
The main reason given in the consultants' detailed engineering report for
the cost increase was the fact that suitable sources of rock and fill
material were not as near to the port as anticipated. Other reasons include
unexpected unusually high inflation rates, the higher than expected cost of
consulting services, and an underestimate of the cost of civil works and
equipment not directly related to the marine and harbor works. After detailed
engineering was completed, the economic rate of return was recalculated on the
basis of the revised estimates and was still considered satisfactory at 12%.
In view of the increase in the cost of the civil works, it was decided in
November 1976 to decrease the disbursement rate from 56% to 50%.
3.16      The new estimate of annual operating and maintenance costs contained
in APN's projections for the port of Vacamonte during the period 1980-1985 are
in excess of appraisal estimates; they amount to about US$990,000 per year
in constant 1975 prices, compared to an appraisal estimate of US$650,000 during
the first year of operation, rising at 2% per year in real terms until 1992.
As the appraisal report does not indicate the level of staffing assumed
in calculating its estimate of annual costs, it is difficult to be precise
about the reason for the difference. Currently, permanent employees of the
Port Authority at Vacamonte number about 140. No efficiency indicators are
available which could be used to judge whether this number of employees
is justified in relation to the operations of the port.
C.   Disbursement Schedule
3.17      The actual schedule of disbursements as compared to that estimated at
appraisal was as follows:



- 44 -
taken into account in the appraisal estimate, namely the cost of exchange rate
adjustments, the cost of land purchase and capitalized administrative and
supervision costs of the APN. Of these by far the most important was the
exchange rate adjustment, arising from the weakening of the US dollar against
the Japanese Yen, which amounted to an additional cost of about US$4 million
in current prices (US$3.3 million in constant 1975 prices). If these "extra"
items are excluded, then the final project cost is US$36.1 million, which is
36% above the appraisal estimate.
3.15      This difference has arisen from an underestimate at the time
of preliminary engineering rather than from significant design changes or
extra equipment acquisition authorized after the award of the contracts.
Most of the cost increase had already been identified during the detailed
engineering which preceded the bidding formalities. *The only contractor
to bid for the marine and harbor works contract offered a quotation which
was in fact slightly below the revised estimate prepared by the consultants.
The main reason given in the consultants' detailed engineering report for
the cost increase was the fact that suitable sources of rock and fill
material were not as near to the port as anticipated. Other reasons include
unexpected unusually high inflation rates, the higher than expected cost of
consulting services, and an underestimate of the cost of civil works and
equipment not directly related to the marine and harbor works. After detailed

November 1976 to decrease the disbursement rate from 56% to 50%.
3.16      The new estimate of annual operating and maintenance costs contained
in APN's projections for the port of Vacamonte during the period 1980-1985 are
in excess of appraisal estimates; they amount to about US$990,000 per year

available which could be used to judge whether this number of employees
is justified in relation to the operations of the port.
C.   Disbursement Schedule
3.17      The actual schedule of disbursements as compared to that estimated at
appraisal was as follows:

3.18      Most of the delay in disbursement occurred during the first two
years of project execution and stemmed from two main causes: the fact that
the bidding procedure was delayed by approximately eight months and the
slowness of the contractor in submitting his monthly bills.
D.   Reporting
3.19      The reporting requirements were understood well and were, on the
whole, met satisfactorily by the Borrower.
E.   Procurement
3.20      The Borrower experienced no difficulty in following and complying
with the Bank's procurement guidelines. Some problems were encountered in
obtaining bids for the construction and delivery of a general purpose boat.
At the Bank's suggestion, APN looked for a used tugboat and were able to

US$100,000.
IV. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
4.01      Tables 4, 5 and 6, attached to this report, summarize the financial
performance of APN during the project execution period; no financial projec-
tions were, however, made for APN at appraisal, so it is not possible to
compare these projections with figures in the Appraisal Report. This was
because, at the time of appraisal, APN was a newly established agency dealing
with the Administration and Operations of six small Panamanian ports with such
low revenues that they were not expected to contribute to the financing of the
project. The major part of maritime traffic was handled at the Canal Zone
ports of Cristobal and Balboa and the banana ports of Armuelles and Aguadulce,
all of which were outside APN's jurisdiction.

4.02       Financial records on APN's ports were not available because no com-
mercial accounts were kept; revenues were collected by the National Treasury,
and maintenance and investments funds for the ports were provided by the
Ministry of Public Works. Since the project port was expected to provide
the majority of APN's future revenue, the financial analysis rightly focused
essentially on Vacamonte port, and no quantified analysis was made for APN as a
whole. This approach led to focusing the appraisal analysis on formulating
and setting financial objectives for the institution. For Vacamonte, the
objective was defined in a covenant calling for:
(i) an annual rate of return on assets of 7% in the second and
third full fiscal years of operation after completion of the
project (1980-81), 8% for the fourth and fifth such years
(1982-83), and 9% thereafter; and
(ii) payment of a return to the Government on funds provided
by it for the financing of the project, of 3% in the third,
fourth, and fifth full fiscal years of operation (1981-83),
and 5% thereafter.
For each of APN's other ports, the objective was defined in a loan covenant
calling for:
(i) full cost recovery of facilities and services provided; and
(ii) a reasonable return on the net fixed assets of each port.
In the absence of reliable revenue and cost data, this broad unquantified
requirement basically aimed at preventing earnings from Vacamonte to be
used to compensate for deficits incurred in other ports.
4.03       In fact, whatever projections had been made at appraisal would have
been way off because the position of APN changed fundamentally in 1979; fol-
lowing the 1978 Panama Canal Treaty, the ports of Cristobal and Balboa
reverted to Panama on October 1, 1979, and their administration and operations
were given to APN. Thus, in 1980, gross revenue of APN was over 50 times
higher than it was in 1975 and the ports of Balboa, Cristobal and the Trans-
Isthmus Railway represented 90% of APN's total gross revenue, with 6% provided
by the Vacamonte port and 4% provided by all other ports. Thus, APN has
become an institution totally different in size and earning power to that
existing at appraisal time.
4.04       The main financial covenant which applied to APN during project
supervision was the profitability covenant for APN's other ports i.e.,
Section 5.05 of the Loan Agreement which required that tariffs at these
facilities should provide revenues sufficient to (i) cover the full cost of
facilities; and (ii) earn a reasonable rate of return on assets. APN com-
plied with this covenant throughout; revenues at these ports increased by
215% from 538 thousand Balboas in 1975 to 1,695.9 thousand Balboas in 1980,
while operating costs increased from 235.2 to 561.2 thousand Balboas, 130%.
Thus, the operating ratio of these ports was always good and declined from 79

Thus, the operating ratio of these ports was always good and declined from 79

in 1975 to 33 in 1980, and the rate of return on net fixed assets increased
from 3% to 12%. (These asset values were established through a study carried
out in 1974).
4.05       Financial performance during the period was dominated by the execu-
tion of the project at Vacamonte. This is shown clearly in the Balance Sheet
(Table 5) which show the Work in Progress account (i.e. Vacamonte Port
Construction) increasing from 0 in 1975 to 55.7 millioti Balboas in 1980 and,
even in 1980, this was nearly 70% of APN's total assets. At the same time,
project accounts dominated APN's Balance Sheet with construction payables
generally being much higher than trade payables (hence the poor current ratios)
and high total debt figures.
4.06       Because of the small size of the institution's operations, which
meant that APN could not be depended on to provided funds for project con-
struction, the execution of the project depended very much on the provision
of timely counterpart contributions from the Government.     As can be seen from
Table 6, the World Bank was expected to contribute 60% of the cost of the
project but, because of cost overruns, the Bank's final contribution was only
43.4%. More significantly, the Government's contribution had to be increased
from $13.5 million to $26.6 million, i.e. an increase of nearly 100%. Provi-
sion of these funds was never a problem and the Government gave full financial
support to executing the project but, in order to do so, a loan was taken out
with the Venezuelan Investment Fund. Although for administrative reasons this
money is shown as lent directly to APN, the Government has assumed responsibil-
ity for interest and principal repayment.    It is, therefore, not considered as
infringing on the debt limitation covenant (Section 5.06).
4.07       1980 results show that Vacamonte itself has been profitable since it
started operation in April 1980.    Revenue  for the year was $2.2 million
Balboas and total costs were $1.2 million, the latter figure excluded deprecia-
tion.  Both these figures are higher than the appraisal report estimates for
the first year of operation (1978) of $1.9 million revenues and $1.0 million
working costs. Furthermore, revenue projections made for Vacamonte for the
purpose of establishing tariffs indicate the following expectations for
1984:

4.08      Thus, although the project is not as profitable in an accounting
sense (because of higher depreciation charges), the cash flow from operations
will exceed the appraisal estimates. Vacamonte is still expected to generate
sufficient funds to meet its financial targets. With respect to the other
financial covenants, compliance has not been a problem, reporting has been
good and auditing was carried out as required.
V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
5.01      The appraisal report estimate of the economic rate of return (ERR)
on the project was 15%. The benefits were divided into four main catego-
ries; those applying to (i) the shrimp industry (34% of total benefits) 1/,
(ii) coastal fishing (26%), (iii) the tuna industry (30%), and (iv) increased
land values in Panama City resulting from the removal of fishing activities
to Vacamonte (10%). The average annual rates of growth of each category of
benefit over the 25 year economic life of the project were: shrimp industry
1.4%, coastal fishing 14.6%, and tuna industry 2.2%. Benefits to the shrimp
industry were subdivided into those accruing to boat owners and operators,
and those to shrimp processors. The former included savings in repair,
maintenance and waiting time for shrimp vessels, a reduction in damage to the
vessel's catch of traditional species, and the value added from the exploita-
tion of new, deeper-water varieties. For the processing sector, the net value
added on both thle reduction in damaged shrimp and the new shrimp species, was
counted as a benefit as was the net value added on the larger amounts of
individual quick frozen shrimp which could be produced at the new port.

4.08      Thus, although the project is not as profitable in an accounting

sufficient funds to meet its financial targets. With respect to the other

V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
5.01      The appraisal report estimate of the economic rate of return (ERR)
on the project was 15%. The benefits were divided into four main catego-
ries; those applying to (i) the shrimp industry (34% of total benefits) 1/,
.(ii) coastal fishing (26%), (iii) the tuna industry (30%), and (iv) increased
land values in Panama City resulting from the removal of fishing activities
to Vacamonte (10%). The average annual rates of growth of each category of
benefit over the 25 year economic life of the project were: shrimp industry
1.4%, coastal fishing 14.6%, and tuna industry 2.2%. Benefits to the shrimp
industry were subdivided into those accruing to boat owners and operators,
and those to shrimp processors. The former included savings in repair,
maintenance and waiting time for shrimp vessels, a reduction in damage to the
vessel's catch of traditional species, and the value added from the exploita-
tion of new, deeper-water varieties. For the processing sector, the net value
added on both thie reduction in damaged shrimp and the new shrimp species, was
counted as a benefit as was the net value added on the larger amounts of
individual quick frozen shrimp which could be produced at the new port.
1/   Discounted at 10%.






- 49 -
Benefits to coastal fishing arose from the value added on the additional catch
that the port would generate. Benefits from tuna operations included fees and
dues collected from foreign tuna vessels by the Port Authority, the value
added generated by the tuna cold store facility, and the net value added on
the increase in handling of tuna at the new port over the existing operations
at Taboga Island.
5.02      The economic costs of the project at appraisal included the capital
costs of construction and of moving the shrimp plants to the new port, pro-
vision and replacement of equipment and annual operating and maintenance
dredging costs. No shadow pricing was used in the calculation of economic
costs or benefits. The economic life of the project was assumed to be 25
years, with no growth in benefits or costs after year 15. A residual value
equivalent to 62.5% of the total infrastructure components 1/ of the project
cost was allowed for in the calculations.
5.03        The information available on actual benefits is limited to only the
first year after completion of the project. Some of the benefits expected at
appraisal had not yet materialized, but on the other hand, there are a number
of positive developments which were not anticipated at appraisal.
5.04        On the negative side, the main differences between the evaluation
in early 1981, and that forecast at appraisal are the following:
(a) a 19% reduction in the volume of the catch of traditional
shrimp species;
(b) a 60% reduction in the anticipated catch of cabezon and
fidel shrimp varieties;
(c) no exploitation of the unnamed deeper water variety of shrimp;
(d) no activities at the port corresponding to the coastal
fishing industry; 2/
(e) a substantially reduced number of calls by tuna vessels; and
(f) the land in Panama City where the shrimp processing and related
activities were located before their transfer to Vacamonte
has not been released by the Government for re-development.
5.05      While some of the positive developments which were not taken fully
into account in the calculation of benefits at the time of appraisal are the
following:
(a) the real value of Panamanian shrimp has increased by nearly 80%
between 1975 and 1980;
1/   Including the cold store building.
2/   Except incidental catches of food fish by shrimp boats.



- 50 -
(b) the port is earning substantial revenues from calls by
foreign fishing vessels such as trawlers which are also
making use of the cold store; and
(c) the construction of the port has generated a considerable
number of ancillary activities in the port area operated by
concessionaires who pay the Port Authority a rent; only some
of the benefits arising from the value added from such
activities were taken into account at appraisal.
5.06      The developments described in paragraphs 5.04,and 5.05 above have
necessitated a new approach to the calculation of the-economic benefits
arising from the project. The methodology of benefit calculation for the
purposes of reevaluation is set out in a separate Annex 1/. The principal
benefits included in the base case calculation of the ERR are:
(a) benefits to shrimp fishermen and processors as at appraisal,
but with a reduced volume catch and applying a higher real
unit value to the catch;
(b) benefits arising from revenue earned by the Port Authority
from calls by foreign fishing vessels, including tuna boats
and reefers;
(c) benefits arising from the net value added generated by economic
activities in the port area excluding those which would
otherwise have taken place in other areas, and those
covered elsewhere in the cost-benefit analysis; and
(d) benefits from the release of urban land in Panama City,
because even though the financial benefits for the Government
have not yet materialized, there is an economic benefit for the
country as a whole as this land is now available for other uses.
In the reevaluation, the market value of the released urban land
is included as a benefit. However, only half of the estimated
enhanced value of the freed and surrounding land is included,
as compared to 100% of this value estimated at appraisal, in
view of the fact that the anticipated land use changes have not
yet materialized.
5.07      The traffic forecasts on which the benefit calculations are based
reflect generally lower figures than were used in the appraisal. On the
cost side, in order to be consistent with the methodology of benefit calcula-
tion, shadow prices have been applied to the labor element in the construction
and operating costs. These shadow wages amount to US$3.50 per day for un-
skilled labor in 1979 prices 2/. Since there is no breakdown available
which might indicate the labor content of the project cost, it has been assumed
that the local labor content to which shadow prices are applicable amounts to
25% of the actual construction cost of the civil works and buildings, and 50%
1/   Available in LCPPR Files and LAC Central Files.
2/   This is consistent with the appraisal report for the Colon Urban Project
(Loan 1878-PAN).   Market wage rates shown in the same report were $8 per
day for unskilled labor.

of the actual annual operating cost and its projections. No adjustments are
made to maintenance costs as this activity is assumed to be carried out wholly
by skilled labor.
5.08      For purposes of the economic re-evaluation, and to enable easier
comparison with the appraisal estimates, all costs and benefits are expressed
in constant 1975 dollars. Construction costs were deflated using the Panama-
nian wholesale price index while annual costs and benefits were deflated with
that index or with the consumer price index as appropriate to each case. The
first year of operation of the port was 1980. The economic life of the pro-
ject is assumed to be 25 years. A residual value of 62.5% of the construction
cost (the same as at appraisal) has been included.
5.09      The re-evaluation analysis resulted in a base case ERR of 7% com-
pared with 15% at appraisal. The main reasons for the lower ERR are:
(a) an economic construction cost approximately 40% higher
than expected;
(b) annual operating and maintenance costs 52% higher
than expected; 1/and
(c) lower benefits than anticipated especially from tuna
operations and coastal fishing.
5.10      To determine the extent to which increased construction costs contrib-
uted to the low reestimated ERR, a sensitivity test was made using the same
benefit streams estimated for the reevaluation, but assuming capital costs at
at the 'levels estimated at appraisal. This sensitivity test showed that if
construction costs had been maintained in real terms at the appraisal estimate,
the project would have had a reestimated ERR of 10%.
5.11        At appraisal, tuna-related benefits accounted for 31% of total
benefits discounted at a rate of 10%. At re-evaluation, they account for 14%.
An analysis has, therefore, been carried out to determine the rate of return
on the extra facilities provided for tuna-related operations. According to
information provided in the consultants' report, the cost of these facilities
amount to just under 20% of the total capital cost, which is equivalent to an
economic construction cost of about US$6.4 million. Annual operating and
maintenance costs attributable to the tuna-related facilities are calculated
by applying the same proportion, while it is assumed that half the maintenance
dredging is for tuna vessels. The benefits include not only the revenues
derived from the international tuna fleet, but also those from foreign trawlers
as well as the net value added from the operation of the cold store. The
analysis results in an ERR of about 2%. In contrast, the shrimp related
facilities have an estimated ERR of 8%. This demonstrates that the provision
of tuna facilities at the pert was less justified economically than the pro-
ject as a whole. It is important, however, to stress the substantial degree
1/   According to information provided by APN, annual operating and maintenance
costs in 1980 were approximately US$1.2 million at current prices.



- 52 -
of uncertainty involved in forecasting this particular type of traffic.     At
the time of appraisal a considerable amount of research was carried out into
the attitude of the tuna industry towards the new facility and assurances
were received that tuna vessels would make use of Vacamonte on a significant
scale.
5.12      Since appraisal, however, a number of important changes have
occurred in the international tuna fishing industry which have had a negative
effect on the use of facilities at Vacamonte. There is evidence that the
stock of tuna available in the waters of the Eastern Tropical Pacific is
declining. The total catch in 1980, at 343,023 US tons, was 7.5% less than in
1979, 15.5% less than in 1978, and 20.1% less than in 1976. 1/ Data for the
first three months of 1981 show a continuing decline with a catch 23.4% less
than in the corresponding period of 1980. The Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission fears that this declining trend may well be due to consistent
overfishing. Total international fleet capacity has increased substantially
since the early 1970s. Not only is there a larger number of fleets, with new
countries entering the market every year, but the average size of the fishing
vessels (especially those of the US fleet) has risen sharply. This increase
in vessel size may have two important consequences which would reduce the
demand for the facilities at Vacamonte:
(a)  the port may be inappropriately designed for the handling of
such vessels, with the approach channel too narrow and the
space for manueverability inside the port area severely
limited; and
(b)  the larger capacity of the vessels, combined with the reduced
resource, means that the fleets make fewer trips and spend a
longer time in the fishing grounds thus reducing the number
of calls within a given period for transshipment and servicing.
5.13      These are not, however, the only reasons why Vacamonte is not being
used to the extent expected by the international tuna fleet. Principal among
the others are:
(a)  transshipment operations are still taking place off Taboga Island
where tuna vessels pay no port dues and where the operation is
apparently satisfactory; at the time of appraisal the impression
was given that tuna transshipment operations off Taboga would
discontinue once the project was completed, basically because
the benefits to the tuna industry would be substantial.
(b)  lack of certain ancillary facilities, especially recreational,
which makes Vacamonte an unattractive mooring area for tuna
fishermen; and
1/   In 1977 there was a reduced catch due to political problems concerning
national jurisdictions over the fishing grounds.

of uncertainty involved in forecasting this particular type of traffic.     At
the time of appraisal a considerable amount of research was carried out into
the attitude of the tuna industry towards the new facility and assurances
were received that tuna vessels would make use of Vacamonte on a significant
scale.
5.12      Since appraisal, however, a number of important changes have
occurred in the international tuna fishing industry which have had a negative
effect on the use of facilities at Vacamonte. There is evidence that the
stock of tuna available in the waters of the Eastern Tropical Pacific is
declining. The total catch in 1980, at 343,023 US tons, was 7.5% less than in
1979, 15.5% less than in 1978, and 20.1% less than in 1976. 1/ Data for the
first three months of 1981 show a continuing decline with a catch 23.4% less
than in the corresponding period of 1980. The Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission fears that this declining trend may well be due to consistent
overfishing. Total international fleet capacity has increased substantially
since the early 1970s. Not only is there a larger number of fleets, with new
countries entering the market every year, but the average size of the fishing
vessels (especially those of the US fleet) has risen sharply. This increase
in vessel size may have two important consequences which would reduce the
demand for the facilities at Vacamonte:
(a) the port may be inappropriately designed for the handling of
such vessels, with the approach channel too narrow and the
space for manuevera-bility inside the port area severely
limited; and
(b) the larger capacity of the vessels, combined with the reduced
resource, means that the fleets make fewer trips and spend a
longer time in the fishing grounds thus reducing the number
of calls within a given period for transshipment and servicing.
5.13      These are not, however, the only reasons why Vacamonte is not being
used to the extent expected by the international tuna fleet. Principal among
the others are:
(a) transshipment operations are still taking place off Taboga Island
where tuna vessels pay no port dues and where the operation is
apparently satisfactory; at the time of appraisal the impression
was given that tuna transshipment operations off Taboga would
discontinue once the project was completed, basically because
the benefits to the tuna industry would be substantial.
(b) lack of certain ancillary facilities, especially recreational,
which makes Vacamonte an unattractive mooring area for tuna
fishermen; and
1/   In 1977 there was a reduced catch due to political problems concerning
national jurisdictions over the fishing grounds.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
6.01      The institutional performance of the Borrower during the implementa-
tion of this project has been good. The Autoridad Portuaria Nacional (APN)
was formed, only shortly before appraisal, in May 1974. Since then it has
expanded to integrate all port related facilities in Panama under one manage-
ment, thus unifying a previously fragmented operating arrangement.
6.02      Since the end of 1979 APN has had to deal with the takeover of the
Canal Zone ports of Balboa and Cristobal. These are major ports, handling
over a million tons of dry general cargo per year, and employing more than
1,000 people. In addition to the administrative burden implied by their
takeover, the retention of the operating staff, previously working for the
Panama Canal Company at relatively high wages, is placing strains on the
salary structure of APN. The Authority has, therefore, become a totally
different institution in terms of both size and earning power, and there
is an obvious need for review of the managerial structure and financial
objectives of the organization as a whole. This will form part of the
Second Port Project Appraisal currently being prepared.
6.03      The Borrower has successfully complied with all his obligations
as set out in the specific covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements.
These are:
(a)  appointment of an Administrator for the fishing port
(Section 4.03);
(b)  establishment of a Fishing Port Advisory Committee
(Section 4.04);
(c)  appointment of independent auditors for APN (Section 5.02);
(d)  debt service coverage not allowed to fall below 1.4
(Section 5.06) 1/;
(e)  no major investments exceeding US$1 million have been made
without the Bank's approval (Section 5.07);
(f)  a tariff schedule prepared by APN which is expected to yield
sufficient revenues to comply with the Bank's financial
objectives (Section 5.04);
(g)  a qualified administrator in the position of Director
General of APN (Section 3.06 of the Guarantee Agreement);
1/   This means that the Borrower   must not incur   any debt unless its
net revenues for the preceeding fiscal year (or later 12 month period
whichever be the greater) are at least 1.4 times the maximum debt
servicing requirement on all debt, including the debt to be incurred.



- 54 -
(h) land acquired for the port and access road construction
(Sections 3.03 and 3.04 of the Guarantee Agreement); and
(i) a timetable for the transfer of shrimp processing and
boat repair facilities from the Province of Panama to the
new port, and the successful implementation of the transfer
(Section 3.07 of the Guarantee Agreement).
6.04      There is little doubt that the institutional issues identified
at appraisal and the recommendations made in order to address them were
correct and appropriate. Management of the Vacamonte Port is competent and
sound, as is that of the Port Authority as a whole, although some altera-
tions in structure will be required as a result of the takeover of the Canal
Zone ports.
6.05      As well as the technical training provided through working with
the consultants during project execution, APN benefited from the assistance
of a team of advisors financed under a UNDP program. The scope of UNDP
assistance had widened since appraisal to cover not only the general areas of
administration and port operations, but also accounting and finance, labor
questions, maritime legislation, pollution control and tariffs. The team thus
helped APN to overcome the administrative problems resulting from the takeover
of the Canal Zone ports.
6.06      In some respects action expected at the time of appraisal from the
Panamanian Authorities has not been forthcoming. In particular, it was
thought that tuna transshipment operations off Taboga Island would be prohi-
bited in order to ensure use of the new facilities at Vacamonte. This has,
apparently, proved to be impossible to do without running the risk that the
transshipment operation would be relocated completely outside Panamanian
waters. The Government's reluctance to lose the traffic completely is under-
standable. Furthermore, there has not been much success in the development
of the artesanal coastal fishing industry with the consequence that there is
no sign to date of artesanal fishermen wishing to use Vacamonte.
6.07      To date, the Panamanian authorities have not released for redevelop-
ment the land in Panama City which has become available following the transfer
of fish processing operations to Vacamonte. The Panamanian Government is
understood to be embarking on a major urban planning study for Panama, through
this, a clear schedule for the development of this area should emerge.
VII. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      There is no doubt that the Bank played an important role in the
identification, preparation and execution of this project. Relations between
the Bank and the Borrower remained good throughout, and during both prepara-
tion and implementation a series of valuable suggestions were made by Bank
staff which helped APN and its consultants to overcome a number of technical
problems and to achieve significant cost savings.

of fish processing operations to Vacamonte. The Panamanian Government is

7.01      There is no doubt that the Bank played an important role in the
identification, preparation and execution of this project. Relations between
the Bank and the Borrower remained good throughout, and during both prepara-
tion and implementation a series of valuable suggestions were made by Bank
staff which helped APN and its consultants to overcome a number of technical
problems and to achieve significant cost savings.

7.02      Nevertheless, important lessons can be learned from this project
which are of relevance to similar Bank work elsewhere. As the results of the
economic re-evaluation indicate, there is a considerable degree of uncertainty
inherent in assessing the feasibilty of fisheries projects. These uncertainties
are compounded when a substantial proportion of expected project benefits re-
lates to the operations of foreign fishing fleets which are not under the
control of the national authorities.
7.03      While there is no doubt that a substantial effort was made on the
part of Bank staff to verify the realism of the traffic forecasts, it is
equally certain that the Bank's role at the project preparation stage would
have been considerably enhanced by a greater input from fishery experts. A
fisheries specialist was not included in the first pre-appraisal mission
team 1/, and although such an expert did form part of the second mission, his
contribution was limited to a few days only.    A greater input by such a spe-
cialist might have resulted in some reorientation of the project concept, and
would have enabled more detailed advice to be given to the Borrower concerning
the development of the inshore fishing industry (para 6.05). In this respect,
a considerable amount of research needs to be directed at such matters as (i)
the cost structure of the individual fisherman's operation, (ii) his attitude
towards payment for improved infrastructure facilities, (iii) the impact of
the use of Vacamonte upon marketing arrangements for food fish, (iv) the need
for a training program for artesanal fishermen, and (v) the need for a sales
promotion campaign to increase fish consumption by the population of Panama.
7.04      The number and frequency of supervision missions was adequate,
especially in view of the relatively problem-free record during project
implementation. However, most of the supervision missions consisted of one
engineer only; as a result, the majority of the supervision reports concen-
trate almost exclusively on engineering matters with little discussion of
other aspects, particularly the evolution of potential port traffic. Again
it might have been valuable to have included an input from fisheries experts
and economists who could have monitored relevant developments in the Panama-
nian and international fishing industries more closely.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      Of the five project objectives listed in paragraph 2.06, only
three have been fully achieved in the manner foreseen at appraisal:
(a) improving the operational efficiency of the shrimp
industry;
(b) developing the management capability of APN; and
(c) release of land for urban improvements in Panama City.
1/   However, a member of staff from the Agriculture Division was in Panama
at the time and available for consultation and discussion.

On the other hand, the project has stimulated the development of a sub-
stantial amount of economic activity in the area of the new port, much of
which would not otherwise have occurred.
8.02      The economic re-evaluation shows the project has a low estimated
economic rate of return. There is little doubt that the benefits which were
achieved could have been realized at substantially lower capital cost. A less
costly port designed exclusively to serve the needs of the Panamanian fishing
industry would have been more appropriate. The provision of facilities for
transshipment and other services to the international tuna fleet shows a lower
ERR than the project as a whole. In view of the fact that the international
tuna fishing fleets expressed strong interest in Vacamonte at the time of
appraisal, it might have been appropriate to have required them to make a
contribution towards the cost of the facility.
8.03      With regard to inshore fishing, it is important to remember that the
provision of infrastructure is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition
for development. Equally, if not more important, are complementary activities,
directed at such aspects as training, credit and marketing. Advice to the
Borrower on such matters would have been more readily forthcoming had there
been a greater degree of involvement from fisheries specialists.
8.04      As far as financing is concerned, experience on this project raises
the question whether the Bank is always justified in prohibiting a Borrower
from requiring bids expressed in US Dollars. As indicated in paragraph 3.14,
the Borrower incurred an additional cost of approximately US$4 million due to
the weakening of the US$ against the Japanese Yen, the currency of the contrac-
tor. At least some of this cost might have been saved had the Borrower been
able to require the contractor to make his original quote in US Dollars.
8.05      The cost estimates at the time of the appraisal were based on pre-
liminary engineering of the project. The detailed engineering design was
carried out after approval of the loan and a substantial cost overrun compared
with appraisal estimates resulted. This experience provides further justifi-
cation for the current policy of the Bank which requires detailed engineering
studies to be carried out before Board presentation.
8.06      The performance of the principal contractor for the marine and
harbor works, and of the consultants appointed to supervise the construction
was good. The program under the smaller contracts for the construction of
buildings and other civil works proceeded less smoothly, mainly because of
lack of experience among some of the contractors (para 3.13).
8.07      The institutional performance of the Borrower during the implemen-
tation of this project was good, and the Borrower has successfully complied
with all his obligations set out in the specific covenants of the Loan and
Guarantee Agreements (para 6.03). On the other hand, some of the actions
expected (but not required under covenants) at the time of appraisal from the
Panamanian authorities has not been forthcoming and this has had a deterimental
effect on the economic viability of the project (para 6.06).

8.08      Experience on this project shows that there is a substantial
degree of uncertainty involved in the forecasting of activities in the
fishing industry. Considerable research needs to be carried out at the
appraisal stage in order to provide a firm basis for forecasts, while the
economic rate of return sought should be high enough to take account of
the substantial risk inherent in fisheries projects.
