PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
IVORY COAST TOURISM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1124-IVC)
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Tourism
Development Project in The Ivory Coast for which Loan 1124-IVC in the
amount of US$9.7 million was approved by the Executive Directors on
May 22, 1975. The Loan was closed on September 30, 1982 and the
undisbursed amount of US$36,428.52 was cancelled on October 28, 1982.
This Project Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Western
Africa Regional Office and is based on information obtained from the WA
Information Center, Appraisal Report No. 666(a) IVC of April 28, 1975,
staff supervision reports, project progress reports, a Government final
report and information gathered by a completion mission to Ivory Coast in
March, 1982.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department but the project was not audited by.OED staff. The
draft Project Completion Report was sent to the Borrower. The reply is
reproduced as Attachment.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
IVORY COAST TOURISM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1124-IVC)
HIGHLIGHTS
The Tourism Development Project successfully met its objectives
of supporting Government's policy of leaving hotel development to the
private sector, with projects sponsored predominantly by local and foreign
promotors. The critical constraint in meeting this objective was the
availability of long-term finance. The Bank loan largely removed this
obstacle by providing a portion of long-term loan requirements and
stimulating participation of other lenders in the field (para 2). However,
the appraisal underestimated the inherent difficulties of developing an
innovative financial strategy involving mobilization of private funds.
This is reflected in actual disbursements which were considerably below
appraisal forecasts during the first three years (para 69).
The appraisal did not calculate the ERR because the number,
classification, and timing of sub-projects were not then known.   Since
the sub-projects have now been in operation for less than three years and
the life of a hotel is 30 years, with substantial residual value, there is
little basis to forecast their financial rates of return and therefore
forecasting an aggregat.e economic rate of return remains equally problematic
(para 65).
The Tourism Development Project's main input was the construction
of 658 rooms for the four sub-projects and a further 248 rooms for a fifth
hotel, the latter only partially ascribable to this project (para 15).
During project execution Credit Cote D'Ivoire the executing agency has
developed a very efficient hotel unit which has been able to appraise
hotel sub-projects and attract and mobilize promoters (para 42).    An
amount of US$37.2 million was mobilized and invested from the private
sector (para 73).
The PCR concludes that the Government policy concerning its
emphasis on private sector involvement in the hotel will continue as is
demonstrated by the satisfactory dialogue and results being achieved
during the execution of the second tourism project financed by Loan 1698 IVC
(para 77).






PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
IVORY COAST
TOURISM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1124-IVC)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        In 1974 the Government of Ivory Coast requested Bank assistance
to develop its tourism industry. A project identification and preparation
mission in June 1974 formulated the Project which was appraised in November
1974 (Report No. 666a- IVC of April 28, 1975). The loan amounting to
US$9.7 million was signed on June 11, 1975 and financed a project consist-
ing of:
(i) a line of credit ($9 million) to provide long term
loans for hotel construction, located in the Credit
Ccte d'Ivoire (CCI) a multi-purpose development bank;
and
(ii) technical assistance ($0.7 million) for strengthening
the tourism sector.
2.        The main objiective of the project was to support the Government's
policy of leaving hotel development to the private sectot with projects
sponsored predominantly by local and foreign promotors. The critical con-
straint in meeting this objective was the availability of long-term finance
particularly since the Government of Ivory Coast was no longer undertaking
hotel investments directly. The Bank loan substantially removed this
obstacle by providing a portion of long-term loan requirements and stimu-
lating participation of other lenders in the field.
II. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
3.        The success in the development of the Ivory Coast economy is
reflected in the 7% growth in real GDP since independence. This growth
was unmatched elsewhere in Africa and only rarely exceeded in the rest of
the world; the main factors in the country's rapid development are the
natural resources which have sustained agriculture growth and the Govern-
ment's open-door polic:y which has attracted resources from abroad (capital,
labor and management). However, in the early 1980's the decline in coffee



- 2 -
and cocoa prices together with laxity in financial management have increased
the debt ratio and reduced considerably the rate of growth of the economy.
During this period, massive intervention by the I2F and IBRD brought only
modest results. However, with the recent start-up of oil production and
the surplus generated by these exports, it is expected that from 1983/84
the balance of payments will improve.
4.        Against a background of heavy investment and economic prosperity
Abidjan's growth has been especially rapid. By 1980 the city's population
had reached an estimated 1.7 million inhabitants. Statistics concerning
the tourism sector show a similar rapid development correlated to the fast
growth of Abidjan as a center of commerce.
III. HOTEL DEMAND AND SUPPLY
5.        Subloans from the line of credit were exclusively devoted to the
const ruction of 3-5-star hotels in Abidjan. 1   This was the sector expe-
riencing the major demand pressure. In 1976, the first year of loan effec-
tiveness, the average room occupancy rate for these hotels was 81.9%, a
very high average rate indicating a substantial frustrated demand during
peak periods (see Table 1). In 1977, there was a large increase in hotel
capacity from 492,753 available room nights the previous year to 627,172,
a growth of 27.1%; this increase in supply was virtually matched by an
increase in demand of 25.0% (from 403,368 occupied roomnights to 504,253)
so that the average occupancy rate remained high at 80.6%. In 1978, there
was very little increase in supply, but demand increased a further 7.3% so
that average occupancy reached a record high of 85.6%.
6.        In the latter half of 1979, demand pressure was relieved by the
opening in August of that year of three of the projects financed under the
loan comprising 628 rooms. 2/ Even though demand reached an all-time high
of 582,890 occupied roomnights, an increase of 7.7% over the previous year,
the average occupancy rate fell to 81.2%.
7.        In 1980, the new supply of hotel capacity was available for the
whole year for the first time and the total number of available roomnights
rose to 866,463, an increase of 20.7%. Just as supply was increasing so
substantially, total demand declined for the first time since 1974 and was
5.0% below the previous year's level. As a result, the average annual
occupancy rate fell to 63.9%, the lowest level since hotel statistics began
to be collected in 1970.
1/ The Second Tourism Loan (1698-IVC) switched concentration to 1-3-star
hotels, throughout the country.
2/ The other hotel financed under the loan opened in 1977 but comprised
only 30 rooms.



- 3 -
8.        In 1981, the number of occupied roomnights remained virtually
the same as in the previous year and therefore still about 5.0% below
1979. Because total capacity declined with the closing of two of the
smaller hotels (the Parc with 79 rooms and the Relais with 82 rooms),
average room occupancy advanced somewhat to 65.3% but was still below
the 80-85% level registered during the second half of the 1970's.
9.        The closing of the two hotels in 1981 was offset by the opening
of the Ibis I in March 1982. There may be further closings during the
1982-84 period. Some existing 3-star hotels may be reclassified as 2-star
but, as such, they would continue to compete for some segments of the
market. No other openings are expected before the end of 1983. At that
time, the Hilton with 248 rooms, and Ibis II with 192 rooms, together
providing an additional 160,600 available roomnights, are scheduled to
come into operations. Accordingly, 3-5-star available roomnights in 1984
would total 1,013,980, a capacity increase of 18.8% in three years.
10.       Thus, in order to maintain the 1981 average room occupancy of
65.3%, close to the 65% rate assumed in the appraisal as the minimum
required to justify the project, traffic would have to increase at an
annual average of just under 6.0% during the years until 1984. Such in-
creases were achieved during the 1970's. The 1980 decline in traffic was
halted in 1981, but whether the previous upward trend will be resumed is
not yet known.
11.       In any event, the major source of hotel demand has increasingly
been from international traffic.   At the time of appraisal, 76% of hotel
roomnights were occupied by international visitors, 2% by Ivorians and
22% by foreign residents of the Ivory Coast. By 1980, the share of inter-
national visitors in total roomnights had risen to 84% because, although
the Ivorian share had risen to 6.5%, roomnights occupied by foreign residents
had more than halved, as a result of a policy change eliminating the long-
term lodging of technical assistants in hotels.
12.       The appraisal forecast that international arrivals would rise from
71,000 in 1973 to 143,00)0-172,000 in 1980. Using the mid-point of 157,000
for the latter range, the appraisal forecast an average annual growth rate
of 11.5%. In the event,, traffic growth easily surpassed the appraisal
forecast (see Table 2). There were 194,101 international arrivals in 1980,
a decline of 2.4% from the previous year, but still representing an average
growth rate since 1973 of 16.0%. In 1981, international arrivals increased
by only 0.6% and were still 4.4% below the 1979 level. A renewed uptrend
will be required if, in the face of the additional capacity financed by the
Second Tourism Loan (1698-IVC) and scheduled to be installed by 1984, occu-
pancy rates in subsequent years are at least to be maintained at the 65%
level (the minimum for viability) if not improved.

IV. HOTEL PROJECTS FINANCED
13.       The first commitment from the US$9.0 million line of credit was
made in August 1976, seven months after loan effectiveness. Eighteen months
later, by February 1978, a further three commitments had been made bringing
the total commitment at that point to US$6.47 million, or 72% of the total.
The remaining US$2.53 million was committed on August 2, 1979 for the Hilton
project which was also partially financed from the Second Tourism Loan
(1698-IVC). 1/ The appraisal report foresaw commitments being completed by
the end of 1978. In fact, the first four commitments were made well ahead
of this date even though loan effectiveness was several months later than
that envisaged in the appraisal. The demand for loan funds for hotel invest-
ment was clearly substantial.
14.       The total investment cost of the four projects amounted to FCFA
8,145.4 million (US$37.5 million), or 5.8 times the amount provided from
the line of credit.
15.       The appraisal report had expected hotels with a capacity of 1,200
rooms to be financed under the project, with 1,000 in Abidjan and 200 on
the coast area of Assinie-Grand Bassam. In the event, all were built in
Abidjan and their total capacity was 658 rooms for the four projects and
a further 248 rooms for the Hilton project, the latter only partially ascri-
bable to this project. The main reason for the shortfall in the hotel capa-
city financed under the project was that average investment costs per room
were higher than envisaged at appraisal: FCFA 12.4 million (US$55,000) as
compared with FCFA 9.0 million (US$40,000), an increase of 35%. Since the
specific subprojects to be financed by the line of credit were not identi-
fiable at appraisal, an average investment cost per room was assumed in
order to calculate the total amount of hotel finance to be provided. It
is not clear from the appraisal how such a cost was derived, but it did not
include a calculation of inflation which was substantial in subsequent years.
In addition, there was a greater emphasis on higher category city hotels
than envisaged and this would also tend to raise average costs.
Novotel
16.       The four-star, 274 room Novotel, located centrally in Abidjan,
commenced construction in May 1977 and opened for operation on August 6,
1979, five months behind schedule. Delays were caused by problems in the
coordination of construction and in the acquisition of the required hotel
equipment packages. The investment amounted to FCFA 2,746 million, which
was only 1.7% above the original estimate of FCFA 2,700 million.
1/ In consequence, further discussion of this subproject will await
the PCR of the Second Tourism Loan.



- 7 -
17.       Equity amounted to FCFA 1,060 million or 38.6% of total invest-
ment. There are a large number of shareholders; Ivorian compAnies and
individuals hold about 30% of the equity. Novotel SIEH, the company
managing the hotel, holds about 15%. The CCI-IBRD loan, which was origi-
nally estimated to amount to FCFA 600 million, yielded only FCFA 550
million in the event because of the fall in the value of the US dollar in 1979
(in which the loan approval was denominated) between commitment and
disbursement. The CCI-IBRD loan represented 20.0%0 of total investment
costs. The remaining investment costs were financed by a long-term
loan from the European Investment Bank and a medium-term loan from a
group of Ivorian financial institutions.
18.       As is common in francophone countries, there are two owning
companies, the Societe Civile Immobiliere, which in effect owns the
building and immovable heavy equipment, and the Societe Anonyme HMteliere,
which owns.the movable equipment and provided preopening expenses and
working capital. The Societe HBteliere rents the hotel building and
heavy equipment from the Societe Civile and arranged for its operation.
This legal structure allows for hotel investment by insurance companies
and pension funds which are permitted to invest in fixed-return instruments
such as shares in the Societe Civile, but not in trading companies with
variable profits (or losses) such as the Societe H8teliere. The rent paid
in this case is divided into two parts, the first covering the Societe
Civile's debt service, the second a fixed return on its investment rising
from 6.5% the first year to 8.5% the fourth year, the capital value there-
after being linked to the Abidjan construction cost index. The Societe
H8teliere in its turn entered into a management contract with Novotel
SIEH which receives a remuneration of 3% of revenues after taxes and 15%
of the gross operating profit.
19.       During the first year of operations, until September 1980, the
average occupancy rate was at 79.1% with an average rental per occupied
room of FCFA 11,174 resulting in total revenues after tax of FCFA 1,612
million and a gross operating profit (after payment of the management
company's 3% fee on revenues) of FCFA 571 million, or 35.4% of such reve-
nues. The following year, ending in September 1981, the average occu-
pancy went up only slightly to 79.4% but the average room rental for
occupied rooms rose sharply by 12.6% to FCFA 12,582. (During the follow-
ing six months, October 1981-March 1982, average room rental per occupied
room rose further to FCFA 14,700, an increase of 16.8%, far in excess of
general inflation rates). Total revenues after tax in 1980-81 amounted to
FCFA 1,811 million from which a gross operating profit of FCFA 636 million
(35.1%) was obtained. There is a good prospect that the GOP will have
been substantially increased during 1981-82 and could well achieve the
management target of FCFA 745 million.
20.       After the Societe Hoteliere paid the management fee on GOP of 15% and
rent to the Societe CivLle, and allowed for depreciation, FCFA 65 million
remained as net profit .or 1980-81 of which FCFA 56 million was distributed
to shareholders representing a 23% return on equity.



- 8 -
21.       The Societe Civile received rents for 1980-81 totalling FCFA 73
million which represented debt service cover together with 7.5% of its
investment (adjusted to the construction cost index). After allowance for
depreciation, there was a net loss of FCFA 28 million. Given the structure
of the rent payments and the statutory depreciation allowances, a negative
cash flow in the early years was to be expected. However, a turnaround
for 1981-82 was forecast with prospective rents rising to FCFA 287 million
which after depreciation and taxes would leave a net profit of about
FCFA 32 million, enough to eliminate previously accumulated losses. Never-
theless, the Societe HMteliere has become more profitable than the Societe
Civile, highlighting the much greater burden of depreciation on the letter
company as defined by the fiscal authorities. The boards of the two com-
panies have considered this matter and are contemplating an eventual merger.
Sebroko
22.       The Sebroko Hotel project underwent changes in the financial pro-
moters, the design, the technical project developers and the prospective
management company prior to and during construction. Even though construc-
tion finally started January 1977, the hotel did not open for operations
until the end of August 1979, sixteen months behind schedule. The hotel
is of four-star category and comprises 270 rooms.
23.       Total investment amounted to FCFA 4,450 million, of which FCFA
121 million, the cost of the access road, was reimbursable by the State.
Equity, amounting to FCFA 1,803 million, or 40.5% of total investment,
was subscribed by a variety of individuals and institutions, 65% of which
are Ivorian of whom one individual with 21% of the equity is the largest
single shareholder.
24.       Of the loan finance, FCFA 650 million, or 14.6% of the total
investment, was provided by the CCI-IBRD line of credit. While this loan
was for 20 years including five years' grace, three other loans were for
ten years, including two years' grace and one for five years including two
years' grace. Debt service burden has consequently been very heavy both
during construction and the early years of operation.
25.       The poor operational performance has added to the project's
financial difficulties. The first year's occupancy rate was only 46.7%
and the second 50.3%. As a result, there was a net loss of FCFA 977 million
the first year followed by one of FCFA 320 million the second year. In
consequence, debt service has not been maintained. The delinquency on
interest payments due to CCI reached FCFA 298.9 million on December 31,
1981 (the grace period on principal repayment was still in force). Prin-
cipal and interest payments in arrears on other loans had reached an
additional FCFA 1,045.7 million.



- 9 -
26.       There were several reasons for the hotel's poor performance.
A major reason must be the poor access. Although on the "Plateau" (the
central area of Abidjan), the hotel can only be reached by a circuitous
road around the edge of the lagoon, a road which in any event is narrow,
poorly surfaced and heavily traficked, particularly by trucks. Road
improvements and the construction of a bridge providing direct access to
the central city have not yet taken place, even though these were planned
for completion by 1977, well in advance of the opening of the hotel.
27.       Furthermore, the eliminaticn in early 1980 of long-stay hotel
accommodations for overseas technical assistants hit the Sebroko hard
because it had encouraged this type of clientele in view of the reluc-
tance of short-stay businessmen to stay there. In an effort nevertheless
to attract such businessmen, the hotel heavily discounted its room prices,
a policy which failed to achieve acceptable occupancies while further
reducing revenues. While the Novotel was able to push its average rental
per occupied room from over FCFA 11,000 to over FCFA 12,000 to well over
FCFA 14,000 in successive years and still maintain occupancy rates of over
79%, Sebroko's average rental remained below FCFA 10,000 throughout the
period at much lower occupancy rates. Since the unit cost of investment
was much higher (FCFA 15.7 million per room at the Sebroko versus FCFA
10.2 million at the Novotel), a higher revenue (occupancy times room rentals)
would be required at the Sebroko to achieve a similar relative result.
28.       Another marketing setback, from which the Sebroko did not recover
in the subsequent two years, was opening at the same time as Novotel, rather
than a year in advance, as originally scheduled, which prevented the Sebroko
from establishing a market ahead of its competitor.
29.       Also, the delay increased interest during construction by more
than FCFA 300 million and eliminated grace periods on medium-term debt
thereby imposing a premature burden of principal repayments on a cash flow
which was severely constrained by substandard revenues and gross margins.
30.       Measures to improve the situation include a change in the manage-
ment plan, an agressive marketing campaign and a reduction in overhead
costs. In order to allow time for these measures to effect animprovement
in cash flow, which joint studies by CCI and Frantel, the management com-
pany, indicate will take place only gradually until 1987-88, a financial
reorganization plan was informally discussed by the principal shareholder,
the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP)
in December 1981. The plan would entail an immediate increase in capital
by FCFA 554 million and a supplementary increase of FCFA 150 million in
1983-84. Existing debt would be rescheduled and a new consolidation loan
of FCFA 800 million to cover settlement of arrears would be provided by
BNP and guaranteed by the Ivorian State. As of May 1982, the foregoing
financial reorganization had not yet taken place.

Hamanieh
31.       Construction of this 84 room, three-star hotel situated in
Marcory, a southern neighborhood of Abidjan, started in February 1978,
and the hotel opened for business on August 25, 1979, about six months
later than forecast.
32.       Occupancy rates have been at high levels, rising from 64.6%
for the remainder of 1979 to 72.0% in 1980 and 86.1% in 1981. Occupancy
was 90.5% in January 1982 and 97.7% in February 1982. The average rental
per occupied room rose from FCFA 7,820 in 1980 to FCFA 8.212 in 1981. As
a result of increases in both occupancy rates and average room rentals,
room revenues rose from FCFA 173.0 million in 1980 to FCFA 216.8 million
in 1981. Total revenues in 1980 were FCFA 288 million on which a gross
operating profit of FCFA 80.8 million was earned or 28.0% of total revenues,
an acceptable percentage by worldwide standards although lower than that
achieved by a number of other Abidjan hotels.
33.       The accounts for 1981 are not yet available but the gross margin
was apparently not sufficient to cover financial charges of which some
FCFA 59.9 million were outstanding to CCI as of December 31, 1981. It is
of particular concern that a hotel enterprise is apparently unable to meet
its obligations even though its trading volume, as represented by the occu-
pancy rate and the average room rental, were satisfactory.
34.       The total investment in the project was estimated at the time of
evaluation at FCFA 660 million and, in the event, cost FCFA 714.5 million,
an overrun of FCFA 54.5 million. or 8.26%. The original equity amounted
to FCFA 230.0 million, or 34.8% of estimated investment costs. The share-
holders financed FCFA 30.0 million of the overrun, while an additional
loan of FCFA 24.5 million financed the remainder. Thus, total equity
finally amounted to FCFA 260.0 million or 36.4% of actual investment costs.
The CCI loan drawn from the Bank line of credit amounted to FCFA 150.0
million or 22.7% of the estimated cost and 21.0% of the final cost.
35.       The major promoters were originally a local entrepreneur, who
already operated a small hotel, the Societe Nationale de Financement
(SONAFI), and the CCI. Then, in 1981, after the dissolution of SONAFI,
the individual entrepreneur bought out SONAFI and CCI and became the
majority shareholder with FCFA 257.96 million of the equity, the other
FCFA 2.04 million being held by other local shareholders.
36.       The hotel has been directly managed although it received tech-
nical assistance in this respect from SIETHO and a French consulting firm.
The hotel currently has a staff of 74 persons of whom four are expatriates.



Stop
37.        The three-star, 30-room Stop Hotel, located in an Abidjan indus-
trial zone, was the first hotel financed under CCI's free limit. It opened
in August 1977, after a construction period of 10 months. Some minor works
continued after the opening. The hotel is owned by an Ivorian and leased
to an individial operator.
38.        The equity funds of FCFA 97.0 million were provided by the indi-
vidual owner. Since the original investment cost estimates amounted to
FCFA 229.0 million, loans were made for FCFA 92.0 million from the CCI line
of credit with the Bank and FCFA 40.0 million from the CCI line of credit
with the regional central bank, the Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique
de l'Ouest (BCEAO). The final cost of the project in the event came to
FCFA 234.9 million and the small cost overrun of FCFA 5.9 million was
financed from CCI-IBRD line of credit. Thus, equicy represented 40.3% of
final investment costs, the CCI-IBRD loan 41.7% and the CCI-BCEAO loan 17%.
39.        Occupancy rates have been very high since the hotel opened although,
in line with the changing supply-demand relationships, occupancy rates declined
somewhat in 1980-81. In 1978, the first full year of operations, occupancy
averaged 98.6%, then dropped to 97.2%, 94.6% and 81.7% in 1979, 1980 and 1981
respectively.
40.        In 1979, gross operating profits were reported to be FCFA 51.9
million, or 63.1% of total revenues and in 1980 FCFA 40.7 million, or 53.2%
of total revenues. Although figures for 1981 are not available, the out-
standing results of the two previous years could not have been maintained
since average occupancy was sharply reduced and also average rent per occu-
pied room went down in the face of increasing competition, from FCFA 7,376
to FCFA 7,121.
41.        At the end of the grace period on June 30, 1979, principal repay-
ments to the CCI-IBRD loan were started, although not in the amounts indi-
cated in the repayment schedule. Furthermore, quarterly interest payments
have been delinquent. As a result, the amount outstanding on December 31,
1981, totalled FCFA 31.5 million.
V. PERFORMANCE OF CREDIT COTE D'IVOIRE
42.        During the project execution since 1975, Credit Cote d'Ivoire
has developed a very efficient hotel unit which has been able to appraise
hotel subprojects and attract and mobilize promoters. In its role the unit
performed well:
(a)  in discouragLng projects which were not viable on
financial and economic grounds;
(b)  in identifying feasible projects on available lots
well located in Abidjan and in giving incentive to
the owners t:o participate in hotel operation;



- 12 -
(c) in researching and negotiating with hotel groups
not only contracts for technical assistance and
management but also financial participation in
equity. In 1975 prospects were limited because
most of the international hotel groups were
reluctant to take equity participations in a
third world country. However, after the success
of the Novotel operation, conditions became more
favorable. Sheraton, Hilton, Hyatt and Sofitel
were all competing to become involved; and
(d) in identifying risk capital and loan finance on
the local and international private markets.
Status Report on CCI
43. Operations: Experiencing increasing resource constraints, resulting
from strict restrictions on rediscounting facilities from the Central Bank,
limited availability of deposits from state institutions and a steady increase
in its arrears, CCI's lending activities have significantly declined in the
recent past. Annual loan approvals, after a steady growth to a peak of
CFAF 17 billion in FY 1978, have been falling, amounting to no more than
CFAF 13.6 billion in FY 1980 and CFAF 9.2 billion in Ft 1981. Sectoral
breakdown of approvals (attachment I) shows that the decline in 1981 was
reflected in all sectors, including a sharp decrease in automobile credits,
which in 1980 amounted for almost 50% of CCI's loans.   Loans to enterprises,
particularly to state corporations also showed a significant drop although
lending of IBRD resources to the private sector PMEs and hotels was maintained.
44, Financial performance:    The decline in lending, particularly of highly
lucrative automobile credits, coupled with a substantial increase in the cost
of borrowed funds, a steady growth in operating expenses and a significant
rise in arrears had a particularly negative impact on the financial perfor-
mance of CCI. Provisional accounts indicate that for the first time in
several years CCI recorded a sizeable loss in FY81 which pushed up its total
debt equity ratio to almost 10:1, well above the 8 1/3 : 1 covenanted with
the Bank.
45. Portfolio. Reflecting the downturn in the country's economic activities
and despite accrued loan collection efforts, there has been a further deterioration
both in CCI's arrears position and the volume of doubtful loans. Reported
arrears as of August 31, 1981 represented over 8% of its portfolio, up from 7%
a year earlier while loans affected by arrears of more than six months accounted
for 15% of the portfolio as against 9.9% in 1980 and 9.5% in 1979. CCI's
provisions to cover possible losses on these loans have as a result, been increased
to 4.9% of the portfolio, up from 4.1% in the previous year.



- 13 -
46.       Diversification Program:   A gradual approach to the projected
expansion into commerciaL activities is being taken. The first phase of
the expansion, consisting of accepting savings deposits and providing
checking facilities to well established existing clientele, is expected
to be operational in March 1982. As the technical assistance for launching
this phase is being provided by two advisors from Banque Populaire, a
French bank, no major problems are anticipated at this time. Developments
would nonetheless be monitored closely.
47.       Prospects:   The strategy followed by the management to overcome
CCI's current difficulties is twofold. First, to call-in the already
approved capital increase, which would provide CCI with FCFA 2.8 billion
in liquid equity funds, (thereby satisfying the covenanted debt equity
ratio) and second, to launch an agressive savings mobilization drive in
conjunction with its planned diversification program. Apart from providing
additional lending resources, these activities are expected to lower the
aggregate cost of borrowed funds and thereby improve CCI's profitability.
While these are steps in the right direction, there was also a need for
CCI to check the growth in its operating expenses and further intensify
its loan recovery efforts.
48.       Technical assistance was provided to Credit Cote d'Ivoire to
assemble financing for the Novotel and Hilton operations by the Banque
de Paris et des Pays-Bas under a contract signed in 1974. Similar assis-
tance was given to CCI by a French promotor (COPRA) for Ibis I and II.
In turn CCI provided assistance to the corporate companies in the prepa-
ration of the technical and financial dossiers for Sebroko, Novotel,
Hilton, Ibis I and II. Eees for this assistance amounted to CFAF 136
million to cover expenditures for international travels and other expenses.
As a bank responsible for the development of the hotel sector, CCI has
performed efficiently in the framework of the general objective of the
GOIC policy.

VI. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
49.       Technical assistance consisting of three experts was included
in the loan project: a financial adviser at the Credit de la C8te d'Ivoire
(CCI), an architect/engineer consultant and a marketing consultant, both
at the Ministry of Tourism. All three experts were expeditiously recruited
and took up their positions in November 1975, two months in advance of
loan effectiveness in January 1976.
50.       The financial adviser's tasks included promotion of projects, the
search for investors anti management companies, financial analysis and evalua-
tion of projects being considered for CCI loans and follow-up on projects
under implementation and subsequent operation. Since all hotel projects
-ecuired government -.pprova; to receive incentives, the adviser sat on the
Conseil Restreint des In- .stissements Touristigues, the inter-ministerial
committee which reviews hotel projects.
51.       A measure of i:he achievements of the financial adviser was the
rapidity with which the commitment of loan funds for approved projects took
place, ten months in advance of the projected final date for commitments
foreseen in the appraisal as December 1978. 1/ Another measure of his
success was that CCI requested extensions of the financial adviser's con-
tract which ultimately carried his services over from the first loan to
the second, full time until April 1981 and part time thereafter.
52.       The adviser's other main task was to train Ivorian staff, but
some of the latter were subsequently transferred to other duties while
others remain within CCI: but not necessarily specializing in the hotel
sector. This reduction in CCI deployment of hotel expertise may well be
justified in terms of the reduction in the relative emphasis of the hotel
sector within CCI's total portfolio (5.8% of that portfolio in 1981).
53.       The architect/engineer consultant's tasks included technical
analysis of tourism and hotel projects, following up projects granted
incentives and reporting on their status, advising the Ministry of Tourism
on maintenance and control of publicly-owned tourism facilities and advising
CCI on technical matters; related to its hotel loan operations, recommending
technical changes in proposed projects and reviewing bid documents where
necessary.
54.       The consultant. was effective in establishing technical standards
for hotel construction and design as required by the Ministry of Tourism
and, to this end, prepared technical documents for hotels of different
1/ The Hilton project was financed partially under the first loan and
partially under the second loan and therefore was not finally approved
for another seven months.



- 18 -
categories.  He also reviewed the technical aspects of applicaticns for
hotel approvals. Finally, he checked hotels under construction to verify
adherence to required standards.
55.       The consultant was not able during the period of the first loan
to make a substantial input into the work of the CCI. This was probably
partly due to the inherent difficulties of coordination, since the architect/
engineer was not attached to CCI but to the Ministry of Tourism. But the
other inhibition was that, because most projects consisted of relativelv
large hotels in the higher categories, CCI was dealing primarily with
experienced hotel management companies which provided their own technical
expertise. Once the second tourism loan came into effect with its emphasis
on smaller, lower-category hotels, the architect/engineer consultant was
able to assist more in the preparation of projects for submission to CCI.
56.       No Ivorian counterpart was recruited during the first loan period.
The consultant's contract was extended, first under the first loan and
subsequently under the second. Finally, a counterpart was appointed in
1981 and accordingly the consultant's contract is being terminated at the
end of 1982.
57.       The marketing consultant's tasks were to include participation
in the market study (see below) with a view to its subsequent implementa-
tion, preparation of a marketing program, advising CCI on the marketing
aspects of projects submitted for financing under the line of credit and
training Ivorian staff. In the event, the marketing consultant was able
to assist his Ivorian counterparts in a commentary on a draft of the
marketing study, but was unable to ensure its subsequent implementation
because his own two-year contract terminated only one month after the
definitive version of the study was submitted in October 1977. During
his two years of service, the marketing consultant was able to provide
the Ministry of Tourism with a certain amount of ad hoc advice although
only intermittently both because of prolonged illness and because of changes
in Ministry .personnel, particularly counterparts.
Market Study
58.       The objectives of the marketing study were to define the tourism
potential of the Ivory Coast, thereby indicating the poles for priority
development, to review current marketing activities and develop a tourism
marketing program and recommend the administrative structure and budget
to achieve marketing goals.
59.       The call for bids was made in April 1975, one and two months
respectively ahead of Board approval and loan signature and seven months
before loan effectiveness. For this reason, the appraisal suggested retro-
active financing of up to US$100,000 of the total allocation for the study
of US$250,000.- A contract with the selected firm of consultants was signed
on September 18, 1975. The study was scheduled to extend over eight months,
with a progress report after three months, a draft final report four months
later, and a final report one month after approval of the draft.



- 19 -
60.       The progress report was delivered on time, but thereafter there
were various delays arising from comments made both by *the Ministry of
Tourism and the Bank and the consultantst reaction to them. Nevertheless,
a first draft of the f:inal report became available on June 17, 1976. But
it was not until November 16, that the Ministry of Tourism, after consulting
the Bank, was able to submit to the consultants its reactions to the draft
and to request further studies. The consultants returned to the Ivory Coast
in July 1977 and the final report was submitted in October 1977, two years
after contract signature rather than the eight months originally envisaged.
61.       One consequence of the delay was that the marketing consultant
to the Ministry had terminated his contract and was no longer available
to assist in the implernentation of the study's recommendations. In any
event, many of the recommendations were not implemented because they were
not practical in terms of existing institutional arrangements and staffing
and because. the ambitious budgets necessary for implementation were never
allocated. In general terms, it is clear that the study was regarded as
a theoretical exercise carried out by outsiders and that there was little
commitment to it by the Ivorian authorities.
VII.  FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RESULTS
62.       The line of credit amounting to $9 million, or FCFA 2,201 million
at the various exchange rates pertaining at disbursements, made possible
the mobilization of private funds for a total investment of FCFA 14,245
million or $47.5 million (with an exchange rate of $1     FCFA 300).  The
ratio of Bank funds to total investment generated has been high at between
5.28 and 6.47 according to the US$-FCFA rate of exchange. Public funds
were limited to:
(a) FCFA 273.12 million in equity for Sebroko, plus
FCFA 114 million as State guarantee;
(b) a guarantee of FCFA 635 million for Sebroko; and
(c) a guarantee of the BEI loan amounting to FCFA 471
million for Novotel,
63.       Thus one of the main objectives of the project namely to mobilize
private funds for the hotel sector, was largely achieved. 1/ Use of public
funds was limited to Sebroko, the first operation, and there is no Ivorian
participation except for guarantees in other operations. The origin of
funds of the various operations is given below.
1/ Between 1964-74, -he Government had invested more than US$60 million
in the sector.

(i) Equity funds came from:
FCFA million           %
Government (Sebroko)                     387.1               7.0
Hotel groups                              787.0             14.3
Foreign banks                            199.0               3.6
Local banks                              168.8               3.1
Insurance companies                    1,330.0              24.2
Industrial companies                     316.4               5.8
Construction and supply companies        924.0              16.8
Ivorian private investment             1,106.4              20.1
Foreign private investment                274.3              5.0
5A493.0             100.0
(ii) Loans were financed from:
CCI/IBRD                               2,201
Local banks                            2,760
(of which FCFA 1,107 million
Foreign banks                          3,380    with a GOIC guarantee)
8 341
In summary, local funds (equity and loan) represent about FCFA 6
billion, or 43% of the total investment, and foreign funds 8.2 billion, or
57%.
64.       No comparison of the financial profitability of the hotels can be
done with the appraisal report since the hotel subprojects were not iden-
tified at that time. The appraisal reports of the four subprojects were
used As references. Revised forecasts are based on: (i) the existing data
on the first years of operations; (ii) the debt service according to the
actual financing plans; and (iii) the fixed assets. For Sebroko, forecasts
show a surplus of FCFA 64 million in 1984 and a first issue of dividends
in 1987 which would represent about 20% of equity. The income statements
of Novotel show a gross operating profit of 36% of the turnover without
taxes but including management fees. In 1986, the consolidated profit of
the Novotel operations would equal the equity of the companies.
the 1983 surplus should be about 26% of the equity. Data on Stop are not



- 21 -
reliable.  However, from the forecast of income statements, it appears
that the financial situation is slightly positive from 1984 allowing some
equipment renewal. In summary, the subprojects appraisal reports esti-
mated a higher and faster return on equity (except for Novotel) than actual
financial results and revised forecasts.
65.       The appraisal did not calculate an economic rate of return because
the number, classification and timing of subprojects was not then known.
Since these subprojects have now only been in operation for less than three
years 1/ and the life of hotel subprojects is 25-30 years with substantial
residual values, there is little basis to forecast their financial rates
of return and therefore forecasting an aggregate economic rate of return
remains equally problematic at this time. The opening of th.e Hilton and
Ibis II partly financedby the second line of credit makes projection on occupancy
rates of existing hotels unpredictable. In addition, the tourism market
is rather stagnant although slightly more favorable than in 1981. Despite
the above factors, the CCI attempted to calculate an indicative ERR for
the package of investments covering the four operations. According to CCI,
the ERR would be around 11-12% based on an annual occupancy rate of 70% and
additional tourist expenditures amounting to 50% of the gross hotel turnovers.
Due to the uncertainties on the future revenues of the hotels,it appears
advisable to postpone the in depth economic analysis of the four hotels to
the PCR of the second .ine of credit.
66.       It was assumed in the appraisal report that foreign visitors to
the hotels under the project would generate an estimated $10 million in
1980, of which 80% would represent foreign exchange revenues. No actual
figures are available on the breakdown between foreign and local visitors.
However, in 1980 the global receipts of the four hotels already opened were
FCFA 3,278 million, or US$10.9 million, a figure comparable to the appraisal
forecast.
67.       It was assumed in the appraisal report that 1,400 new jobs would
be created based on a ratio of 1.2 employees per room, and 1,200 rooms.
Actually, 906 rooms were constructed and 852 new jobs created (ratio 0.93
employees/room).
1/ As noted, the Hilton, partially financed from the project, will not
start operations until late 1983.

VIII.  BANK PERFORMANCE AND LESSONS LEARNT
68.       The project supported the Government policy of leaving the further
expansion of the hotel industry to the private sector, a policy which con-
tinued under the second project. The project content was well designed in
terms of size, scheduling and subloan conditions. Even though the volume
of. rooms financed was less than envisaged at appraisal because of increases
in unit costs of investment, the total traffic accommodated was close to
projection because occupancy rates were higher than estimated at appraisal.
The elimination of the 200 rooms originally scheduled for beach development
(see para. 15), result from a perception of limited market demand and a
consequent lack of investor interest.
69. The preparation of subprojects took longer than foreseen as reflected
in actual disbursements which were considerably below appraisal forecasts
during the first three years.    Commitments  were generally ahead of sched-
ule . The appraisal underestimated the inherent difficulties of developing
an innovative financial strategy involving mobilization of private funds
for a sector considered as not attractive by private/foreign investors.
CCI implementation capacity, which did not exist at appraisal, was progres-
sively developed and is now operating very well. After initial delays,
procurement/construction were generally on schedule.
70.       Execution of the project did not require major supervision from
the Bank. Seven supervision missions visited the country between July 1975
and February 1981. Total staff weeks for supervision was about 50 staff
weeks or less than 10 sw per year, a very low figure. Despite the dis-
solution of the Tourism Projects Department in 1979 with transfer of super-
vision responsibilities to the Urban Projects Department, and the regiona-
lisation of the Urban Department in 1981, the continuity in Bank staff
supervising the project was maintained with only two project officers over
seven years.
71.       The relationships between the Bank and the various agencies con-
cerned with the project were excellent throughout the preparation, appraisal,
negotiation and execution phases of the project.    Cooperation was outstanding
between the Credit C8te d'Ivoire, the Ministry of Tourism and the Urban and
IDF Divisions, especially in regards to appraisal and approval of subprojects.
The reports prepared by the Ivorian agencies were well prepared and documented
even in the difficult case of the Hilton.
72.       The Bank's role at the beginning of project implementation was to
assist in the development of appraisal capabilities within CCI and to fami-
liarise the CCI appraisal unit with Bank procedures. Follow-up procedures
were established, quarterly reviews of financial statements were made by
CCI and key operating statistics for each of the CCI hotel borrowers. The
institutional building aspect of the project was successful as the good
pace of execution of the second line of credit subsequently showed.



- 23 -
73.       The Bank successfully supported the Government's policy on the
privatisation of the hotel sector. The mobilization of $39 million from
the private sector was forecast and in fact $37.2 million were invested.
74.       Whereas most of the subprojects were well conceived, the diffi-
culties encountered by the Sebroko (see paras. 22-30)underline the danger
of approving a subproject whose ultimate viability depends on external
investments not assured within the subproject itself. While the lack of
bridge and road access (see para. 26) was not the only factor in the hotel's
poor performance, the resultant poor location seriously compounded other
constraints. It would always be preferable to be assured of public infra-
structural support before siting a hotel enterprise.
75.       With respect to the technical assistance provided under the project,
the continued extensions of the contracts of the financial adviser (see
para. 51) and the architect/engineer (see para. 55) respectively are at once
testimony as to their operational effectiveness but an indication of a
failure to train counterparts to take over their responsibilities at a reason-
ably early date. However, under the second loan, counterpart training was
so speeded that by mid L982 all but one expatriate adviser had been replaced
by Ivorians, with the remaining adviser due to be terminated by the end of
the year.
76.       Finally, the -ailure to implement the recommendations of the
market study (see para. 61) was a result of a lack of commitment by the
Ivorian authorities to i:he objectives of the study and a consequent un-
willingness to devote the budgetary and organizational resources necessary
to carry out its major recommendations.
IX. CONCLUSION
77.       There is alwayrs a large degree of uncertainty during the initial
years of hotel operations and the economic life of a hotel is long. Of
the four hotels financed by the line of credit, Novotel, Stop and Hamanieh
are doing well, Sebroko has problems due to the structure of the financing
plan, the decline in long-term residential demand and the problems of
access to the hotel site. A continuation of the Government policy concerning
its emphasis on private sector involvement in the hotel industry is highly
probable as is demonstrated by the satisfactory dialogue and results being
achieved during the execution of the second line of credit. The Bank will
remain concerned with the sector until completion of the second loan in
December 31, 1984. At that time, it will be possible to review not only the
operation financed under Loan 1698-IVC but to proceed to an in-depth evalua-
tion of the operations which were financed by Loan 1124, for which this
report was prepared. In the meantime, overall performance of the CCI will
be regularly reviewed by IDF staff in connection with the various SSE
Projects.
