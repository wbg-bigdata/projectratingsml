REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST FOR
A TOURISM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of the Ivory Coast for the equivalent of US $9.7 million to
help finance a Tourism Development Project. The loan would bear interest at
8.5 percent per annum. US $9.0 million of the loan, would be relent at the
same interest to the Credit de la C6te d'Ivoire for onlending to hotel promo-
ters at 11.5 percent. Amortization of this part of the loan would substantially
conform to the aggregate of the amortization schedules applicable to the speci-
fic investment projects financed, none of which should exceed 20 years. US $0.7
million would finance a marketing study and technical assistance and would be
amortized during the first five years of the repayment period.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on the Ivory Coast, Report
No. 296 - IVC "Current Economic Situation and Prospects of the Ivory Coast",
April 11, 1974 which is based on an economic mission in April of 1973, con-
firmed the country's favorable growth prospects and its creditworthiness.
It concluded also that the Government's development efforts required and
deserved continued external support. While recent developments in export
and import prices led to substantial quantitative changes in the balance of
payments' estimates from those made in the report, our revised calculations
still support these conclusions. Annex 1 contains basic country data.
3.        Throughout the 1960's the Ivory Coast's economic growth was rapid.
GDP grew at an annual rate of 7.5 percent in real terms and in 1972 per
capita income reached US$340. Although this growth rate could not be fully
sustained in the early 1970's because of deteriorating terms of trade and
adverse weather conditions, growth in 1971-74 still averaged 6 percent a
year, in real terms. Factors contributing to rapid growth were the Govern-
ment's liberal and pragmatic economic policies which have made the country
attractive to foreign investors, the availability of ample land and timber
resources, the existence of a large pool of labor including immigrants from
sahelian countries and, during the late sixties, rising commodity export
prices. Recognizing the country's vulnerability in its dependence on three
export commodities (cocoa, coffee and wood constitute 80 percent of total
exports while exports are some 32 percent of GDP), the Government began after
1965 to diversify agriculture by introducing or expanding oil palm, coconut,
pineapple, rice, rubber, cotton and sugar cultivation--and by placing more
emphasis on other economic sectors such as industry, mining and tourism.
Although the full benefits of these diversification efforts are still some
years off, the prospects are that the Ivory Coast will gradually become less
dependent on its traditional exports.



4.        The Government's development objectives include, in addition to
broadening the production base, the extension of economic infrastructure in
such fields as transport and power, the improvement of urban facilities,
regional diversification, the development of secondary industrial centers,
the development cf education and the Ivorianization of the economy.     Tnese
objectives correspond well to the needs and the possibilities of the country.
Past and ongoing development has laid a solid foundation for further growth.
Moreover, Government and private investment activities indicate that the
country's growth possibilities are being recognized and exploited.
5.        The Government's awareness of social problems is reflected in the
current (1971-1975) Plan's emphasis on the income effects of development,
regional balance and education. Thus, to reduce inequalities, recent salary
raises have been graded dowrn from 26 percent for the lowest to 5 percent for
the higher paid workers. A number of projects, for instance, cocoa, rice,
oil palm, rubber, sugar and cotton are designed to narrow the gap between
urban and rural incomes and to reduce regional income disparities. In the
same vein, over the past five years, the Government has increased producer
prices for cocoa by 120 percent, for coffee by 60 percent and for cotton by
35 percent.
6.        Hlowever, the next Plan (1976-80) will need to focus more sharply
still on problems of urbanization, prospects of employment in both rural
and urban areas and income distribution. To assist the Government in these
directions a special Bank employment mission, which included ILO staff,
visited the Ivory Coast. The mission's report "Ivory Coast: Special
Report on Employment" (Report No. 279 IVC) was issued in July 1974, after
detailed discussions with the Government. The mission identified the em-
ployment problem as one of growing imbalances: while projected demand for
labor appears to be matched by manpower supply (including immigration)
shortages in rural areas and a surplus in urban labor markets will develop
in the absence of corrective action. The mission also singled out a number
of issues for further study, including the costs and benefits of creating
a better economic and social infrastructure in secondary centers combined
with a certain degree ot industrialization and suggested changes in educa-
tional and training systems.
7.        To assist the Government in the orientation of its industrial
policy, a Bank mission, including a UNIDO staff member, prepared the report,
"Current Status and Prospects of the Industrial Sector in the Ivory Coast"
(Report No. 553--IVC), which was issued in February 1975 'after detailed dis-
cussions with the Government. The mission calculated that local raw material
processing and import substitution industries contributed equally to the
impressive sectoral growth in real terms of 15 percent per year during the
1960-1973 period. As pursuing import substitution much further may be costly
to the economy, the mission supported the recent change in Government policy
encouraging industrial exports and recommended modification of the Investment
Code accordingly. The mission agreed with the Government that Ivorianization
in terms of capital and labor of the, at present, largely foreign-owned manu-
facturing sector should have high priority. Future growth prospects were
evaluated favorably by the mission.

8.        Our forecasts show that, after the recent changes in the commodity
price structure, successful implementation of the Government's development
program will more than in the past depend on the availability of foreign
funds. Until recently, most Ivorian export products have been in strong
demand. Therefore, in 1974, higher export earnings more than compensated for
higher import outlays, resulting in a US$50 million balance of payments sur-
plus after three consecutive years of deficit. However, current Bank commodity
price forecasts point to a gradual deterioration of the Ivory Coast's terms
of trade for the remainder of the 1970's, and revised growth forecasts for
Western Europe, the Ivory Coast's main export market, suggest that the decline
in economic activity may be deeper and longer lasting than anticipated earlier.
In 1974, already, timber exports dropped markedly as a direct consequence
of a slump in the European construction industry. Yet, the import bill will
continue to rise rapidly because of high inflation rates in supplier countries,
especially for investment goods, fertilizers and oil. The net oil import bill
went up from US$15 million in 1972 to US$80 million in 1974 and is expected
to reach US$90 million in 1975, an increase from 3 percent of 1972 commodity
imports to 8 percent in 1975. The Government has taken vigorous action to
limit the impact of higher imports on the country's balance of payments. For
instance retail prices of petroleum products, electricity, rice, sugar and
other consumer products have been increased sharply, while the producer price
for rice has been doubled to encourage local production. The country's first
sugar mill started operating in April 1975. Its production will replace
50,000 tons of sugar imports and meet approximately current domestic demand.
Plans for an extension are in an advanced stage of preparation. These and
similar efforts in other lines of production will permit a reduction in the
share of food imports from its present level of about 20 percent of total
commodity imports.
9.        Despite all this, the trade surplus is expected to dwindle and it
will no longer compensate for the deficit in non-factor services, as it did
in the past. Consequently, and in contrast to the 1965-1970 period when the
Ivory Coast enjoyed a resource surplus of US$35 million per year on average,
a resource gap of US$80-100 million per year in the second half of the 1970's
appears inevitable. This is equivalent to about 2.5 percent of projected GDP
or about 5.5 percent of projected exports and non-factor services in 1975. As
in the past, with interest payments, transfers of profits and workers' remit-
tances abroad, the factor services account will continue to be in deficit as
well. Therefore, to maintain balance of payments equilibrium there will have
to be a substantial compensatory inflow of capital from abroad. The Govern-
ment may have to draw on the Oil Facility again as it did in 1974 for an
amount of US$13.3 million. Indications of a possible discovery of offshore
oil are interesting in this respect, but too premature to be taker into
account at this stage. Reserves at the end of 1974 stood at about US$65
million, which is equivalent to 3.5 weeks of 1974 commodity imports.
10.       Based on past experience and assuming an adequate inflow of capital,
Ivory Coast's economy may be expected to adjust to changing world economic
conditions. Early in 1974, the Government established a task force to advise



-4-
on short term adjustments; the need for structural changes is being given
particular attention in the preparation of the new Five-Year Plan. Good
growth prospects in several sectors should facilicate the adoption of corrective
measures. For example, Ivory Coast has substantial potential to increase
electricity generation from hydro-sources. Sites in addition to the three now
in operation were already being studied before the `oil crisis" and the pro-
gram for hydro-electric development will be speeded up. According to the
Government's program, an estimated 85 percent of Ivorian demand for electri-
city would be met from hydro-electric plants by the early eighties against
40 percent at present. The possibility of increased domestic energy produc-
tion at reasonable cost may accelerate the implementation of the Government's
policy to process raw materials locally rather than exporting them in unpro-
cessed form as is generally still the case.
11.       Structural changes will take time and imply the continuation of a
sizeable investment effort. In recent years gross investment averaged about
21 percent of GDP, and the proportion of the public sector in total invest-
ments increased from an average of 50 percent in 1965-70 to 60 percent in
1970-73. Public investments for 1975 are estimated at about US$470 million.
This amount would have to double in current prices between 1975 and 1980,
in order to maintain the investment rate necessary to achieve a growth of GDP
by 6 percent per year in real terms.
12.       Domestic public savings in the future are likely to cover a smaller
part of capital outlays than they did in the past, even assuming continued
good fiscal performance. With budget revenues already exceeding 20 percent
of GDP, future Government resources cannot reasonably be expected to increase
much faster than the economy as a whole. The Government has been quite suc-
cessful in generating budgetary savings but with rapidly increasing social
expenditures, for instance for housing and education, these savings will be
under heavy pressure. To some extent savings from public enterprises will
provide some relief to the budgetary constraint. Also, higher world prices
for agricultural exports will boost revenues of the Stabilization Fund.
However, as indicated before, the Government's producer price policy is to
pass more of these benefits to farmers, and as a result this source of public
savings is unlikely to expand. Furthermore, savings after debt service,
which in the past financed4O to 50 percent of public investments, will on aver-
age represent no more than 25 to 30 percent of public investments in the next
five years. Thus at least 70 percent of public investments will have to be
financed from other sources.
13.       The chances that additional domestic private funds could be raised
to finance public investments remain low for two main reasons. First, tradi-
tionally part of the profits made by foreign investors has been transferred
abroad and this will continue in the future. Second, non-Ivorian labor--it
is estimated that between 15 and 20 percent of the Ivory Coast population is
non-Ivorian--transferred about US$100 million to their home countries as
workers' remittances in 1973. Direct controls to limit private transfers are
not permitted within the Franc zone of which the Ivory Coast is the most im-
portant member in Africa; such controls would probably be counter-productive



-5-
by deterring foreign private capital, and they would represent a serious blow
to the Ivory Coast's much poorer neighbors, especially Upper Volta, which re-
ceives 50 percent of immigrant workers' remittances. But those transfers, of
course, mean a substantial drain of domestic savings for the Ivory Coast. To
encourage keeping funds in the country the Government has proposed to the
Central Bank of the West African Monetary Union to raise the base interest
rate from the low level of 5.5 percent. However, other members of the Union
have opposed this move as they fear an adverse effect on their investments.
Steps by the Government to raise interest rates, establish a local stock
market and place more emphasis on Ivorianization of the economy are not
likely to alter these flows substantially in the medium term. Government
bonds issued with a tax free return of 7 to 10 percent have been moderately
successful so far.
14.       Absorptive capacity in terms of projects to be financed in the
public sector is substantial. The inflow of foreign loan capital into the
public sector in 1974 was about US$215 million; in 1975 it may need to be as
high as US$325 million. Assuming that 40 to 60 percent of future foreign
capital requirements will continue to be provided by international organiza-
tions and foreign governments and the rest by more expensive sources like
suppliers credit and private banks, the debt service ratio would rise from
its rather low level of 6.6 percent in 1973 to around 15 percent in the
early 1980's. We consider this level to be manageable. If the capital
required cannot be obtained on appropriate terms, the investment program
would have to be cut back and overall growth would drop below 6 percent. The
projected average contribution of net public savings to the financing of
public investments (paragraph 12), will in many cases be less than the
local cost component of projects. Therefore foreign donors should be willing
to finance not only the foreign cost component of projects but also some local
costs in those projects where the foreign exchange component is low.
15.       A basic economic mission scheduled for 1975 will evaluate the
country's long-term prospects in the context of the draft 1976 to 1980 Develop-
ment Plan, and will undertake a thorough reexamination of our projections,
the underlying assumptions and especially the consequences for Ivory Coast's
external borrowing and debt service. However, there is little reason to
believe that there will be much if any reduction in the higher level of
capital requirements now foreseen. The terms of borrowing therefore become
a more important consideration. If, for instance, the supplementary needs
of future capital were to be met on terms offered in the Eurodollar market--
to which the Ivory Coast has access--the debt service could substantially
surpass the level of 15 percent projected for the 1980's. To keep the debt
service within manageable limits and to enable the Government to implement
its development policy, it is desirable that foreign capital be made avail-
able on as concessionary terms as possible, including long repayment and
grace periods. In view of the still low debt service ratio, the good future
growth potential of the economy and the expected increase in export earnings,
the Ivory Coast remains creditworthy for substantial additional borrowing
from the Bank.

PART 11 - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE IVORY COAST
16.       Since 1968, the Bank's lending to the Ivory Coast has expanded
rapidly and now includes eighteen loans totalling US$187.4 million and an IDA
credit of USS7.5 million. Four of these nineteen operations were for roads;
six were to the member companies of the SODEPALM Group for the development of
oil palm and coconut plantations and the construction of two oil mills;    the
remaining nine loans were for education, telecommunications, rubber, cocoa
and cotton plantations and the Abidjan sewerage and drainage system.    The IFC
also has a small participation in the Banque Ivoirienne de D6veloppement
Industriel of US $204,000 which was increased in 1974 by a 50 percent stock
dividend. So far in FY 75, the Executive Directors have approved loans for
the Ivory Coast cocoa, cotton and Abidjan sanitation projects and for supple-
mentary financing to cover the increased dollar costs, due to currency realign-
ments, of the First Education Project. A fifth loanm this one for the Second
Education Project, was approved by the Executive Directors on Mlay 13,
1975. Annex 2 contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects with particular reference to those which
are encountering problems in execution anl giving rise to delays in disburse-
ments.
17.       The agricultural sector is the principal foreign exchange earner
and domestic employer. It provides close to 90 percent of exports, employs
a majority of the population, helps stabilize an increasingly mobile popula-
tion, and brings development to remote areas of the country. Our principal
efforts have therefore, been in this sector. We have just appraised together
with the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) a rice project in
the forest zone of the Ivory Coast. In addition, an agricultural development
project is under preparation for FY76 and we are considering preparing a live-
stock development project for FY78. The Government has also requested our
assistance 'Lr financing additional oil palm, coconut and rubber development
in the Ivory Coast's South-West.
18.       In order to strengtheni the country's major transport axis and link
the agricultural areas to its urban centers and ports, we have placed con-
siderable emphasis on transportation and have become the principal lender
for road construction anm' maintenance.  The Bank was closely associated, as
excuting agenicy, with the 1969 UNDP Transport Survey of the Ivory Coast.
The Government and the Bank are currently discussing the possibility of
financing the updating of the Survey as a basis for determining priority
transport investments in the 1976-1980 National Development Plan now under
preparation. A Fifth Highway Project was appraised in 1974 and includes a
second phese of the pavement strengthening program (about 200 km) initiated
under the Third Fio'hwn,1 Project, construction of the An-arna-Agboville road
and a section of the Abidjan-Adzop6 road.   The Government has requested our
assistance in financing tl- improvement of a section of the Abidjan-Ouagadougou
rail line.  Other sections of the rail line are being financed by EDF and EIB.
19.       Urban infrastructure and education are two important social sectors
in which the Bank is involved. A loan for a sewerage and drainage project cover-
ing the first phase of a ten-year Government program to improve sanitation



-7-
JnTh Abidjan was signed in January 1975.   We are also preparing a water suppSly'
p"-djcect for secondary towns.  A study of the development of a pnew. quarter
,_T,f,Abidjan is being financed with Bank funds.  With regard to education the"
-Ba4nk is closely 'associated with the Government's efforts to modernize6its
1dTiTdu'cational system principally at the secondary and vo6cational lev6eis.  A

21.       Of the total external public debt outstanding at the end of 1973,;'
30 percent was owed to Governments, 20 percent to international organiza-
tions (of which 60 percent to the Bank Group), 20 percent came from private
banks and through bond issues while 30 percent came in the form of suppliers'
credits. The capital not supplied by international organizations came mainly
from four countries, France (35 percent), USA (27 percent), Italy (15 percent)
and Germany (8 percent).   France and the European Communities remain the
principal source of development assistance in grant form, accounting for
about 15 percent of the total flow of foreign assistance to the public sector.
22.       The Bank Group's share of the Ivory Coast's external debt, which is
now approximately 12 percent (including undisbursed), is likely to increase in-.
the next five-year period to about 18 percent. The Bank Group's share of
debt service is at present 3.4 percent and is expected to go up to about 7
percent by 1980.
PART III - THE TOURISM SECTOR
23.       The Ivory Coast is emerging as a tourist destination.    Its capital,
Abidjan, has become one of the leading cities in West Africa. It is close to
ocean beaches and enjoys an attractive location on a lagoon amid a network of calm,
protected waters with a shoreline of about 100 kms. A large number of restau-
rants and night clubs offer high quality international cuisine and entertainment.
Abidjan is also a center for African art, plentiful in colorful markets through-
out the city.   Finally, the tropical vegetation of the country's interior
provides an intriguing contrast to the beach areas of Assinie and Grand Bassam
near Abidjan.
24.       Despite these attractions, pleasure tourism has been hampered by
several drawbacks. First, the Ivory Coast is relatively far from
tourism-generating countries and transportation costs to it.are hiah.    Secont



-8-
the climate in the southern half of the country is hot and humid and, although
the coastline has fine beaches, swimming in the sea can be hazardous because
of dangerous currents. In addition, efforts to promote the country's tourism
image abroad have been insufficient. On the other hand, business travel to
the Ivory Coast has increased substantially over the past few years. Mainly
as a result of the country's program to diversify its economy, Abidjan has
become one of West Africa's commercial centers. Although hotel accommodations
in Abidjan have expanded substantially, hotel occupancy has remained high.
The Market
25.       In 1970 an estimated 45,000 foreign arrivals were recorded in the
Ivory Coast. This number grew at an average 17 percent per year to reach
71,000 visitors in 1973. Business travelers dominate the market, accounting
for 85 percent of total arrivals. They spend an average of four to five
nights almost exclusively in Abidjan.. The remaining arrivals were pleasure
tourists.  About two thirds of the latter were travelling through West Africa
on circuit tours and spent one or two nights in Abidjan. The remainder came
specifically to the Ivory Coast and spent between six and eight nights at the
two beach resorts of Assinie and Assouinde.
26.        Foreign tourists are about 50 percent French, 12 percent
African, 10 percent American, 6 percent each Italian and German and 16 percent
of other nationalities. The daily expenditure per visitor fluctuates between
$35 and $45 for vacation tourists and $45 and $66 for businessmen.
27.       The convention market offers a good potential for development.
Since 1972 Abidjan has had extensive, modern facilities for groups of up to
4,000 people. The city is conveniently located to become an important meet-
ing place for African and world conventions. So far, however, promotional
activities which are a prerequisite for success in the highly competitive
conference business have been lacking.
Market Projections
28.       Assuming continuing economic growth and diversification in the Ivory
Coast, the number of businessmen visiting the country through 1980 can be
expected to continue to grow. Several factors - the high cost of transporta-
tion, the slow development of circuit travel in the region, and the intensely
competitive nature of convention tourism - will probably continue to hamper
vacation tourism during this same period. All in all, however, the growth
rate of visitor arrivals is expected to remain at a healthy 11 to 13 percent,
and total arrivals should reach 157,000 by 1980. According to these projec-
tions, by 1980 Abidjan will require an additional 800 to 1,400 rooms and
adjacent beach resorts will need about another 200.



-9-
Facilities and Incentives
29.       Hotel accommodations in the Ivory Coast have doubled since 1970.
They now comprise about 2,900 hotel rooms, of which 1,600 are located in
Abidjan, 600 in the coastal area of Assinie/Assouinde and 700 in the interior
of the country. Six of the hotels in Abidjan (1,150 rooms) are of international
standard. Despite the rapid expansion of accommodations, 1973 occupancy
levels were about 80 percent in Abidjan with turnaway demand during active
periods and 57 percent from October through April, the peak season, in the
two vacation resorts. In the interior of the country, they ranged from 30
percent to 90 percent and averaged close to 50 percent.
30.       Air routes provide the best access to the Ivory Coast from Europe,
the United States and other African countries. Air Afrique, the multinational
West African states' airline, headquartered in Abidjan, serves the country
along with 15 other international air carriers. Abidjan's international air-
port (Port Bouet) is well equipped to handle all modern commercial aircraft.
Yamoussoukro, an important inland city, has a large new airport capable of
handling international flights. Another 26 regional airports are scattered
throughout the country. They are served by Air Ivoire, the country's domestic
airline.
31.       From 1964 to 1974, the Government invested about US$60 million in
tourism (excluding operating budgets of interested ministries). These expen-
ditures included investments in infrastructure and hotel projects (47 percent),
operating subsidies (19 percent) and direct loans (34 percent). More than
half of the investment went into the construction of the large and modern
Hotel Ivoire in Abidjan. The rest of the funds were spent to build the two
vacation villages mentioned above, an average of one hotel per year in the
interior of the country, and related infrastructure.
32.       WEth the major infrastructure in place at Abidjan and the adjacent beach
areas, the Government is now seeking to attract private promoters for hotel con-
struction. The Government finances secondary infrastructure such as access
roads to hotel sites and connections for electricity, telecommunication,
water and sewerage. These expenditures, most of which are to be recovered by
regular charges for these services, are paid out of the Ministry of
Finance's Special Budget for Investment and Equipment (BSIE) once the ap-
plicant's project has received final approval. To further encourage invest-
ment, a Tourism Incentive Code was introduced in 1973. The Code exempts
investors from value-added tax and duties on imported materials and equipment
used for construction and, depending on priority of the investment, provides
additional benefits for up to seven years from the first year of operation
covering Government and local real estate taxes, sales and income taxes, and
license fees. These incentives are considered reasonable. They are negotiated
individually, based on each project's specific merits.



- 10 -
33.       To become eligible for any of the incentive benefits, an investor
must first submit an application to the Ministry of Tourism, which issues its
approval("Agrement Professionnel") after analyzing construction sites and
architectural and other technical data, and must, secondly, obtain approval
from the Ministry of Planning ("Agrement Prioritaird'), which is subject to
recommendations by a special committee representing the Ministries of Tourism,
Finance and Planning. The committee evaluates the investor, the proposed
management and staffing, the marketing strategy and the financial and economic
aspects of the project.
The Ministry of Tourism
34.       The Ministere d'Etat Charge du Tourisme (Ministry of Tourism) was
created by decree in December 1971. Its main functions are dealt with by
four departments: (i) the Regulations Department, covering classification
and inspection of hotels; (ii) the Projects Department which is responsible
for tourism studies, projects development, infrastructure, and administration
of the Agrement Professionnel; (iii) the Promotion Department, in charge of
marketing, statistics and training; and (iv) the Administration and Finance
Department. In addition, the Ministry supervises the Societe Ivorienne
d'Expansion Touristique et Hoteliere (SIETHO), the Ivory Coast Travel Agency
(ICTA), and the Office Nationale d'Artisanat et d'Art (ONAA).
35.       The Ministry's activities have been handicapped mainly by its low
operating budget (US$1.9 million in 1974) and insufficient staffing. Although
the department heads are competent, it lacks professional support personnel.
For example, marketing at present has a budgetary allocation of only US$36,000
and insufficient staff. To develop tourism in the Ivory Coast, the Promotion
Department must be strengthened with technical assistance and increased funds
which would permit it to establish and implement a more aggressive marketing
program.
Financial Environment
36.       Besides the Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest
(BCEAO), financial institutions in the Ivory Coast include four commercial
banks, three development banks, two leasing institutions, and the Caisse
Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA) which manages public debt. So far only the
Banque Ivoirienne pour le Developpement Industriel (BIDI), a privately owned
dfe, has invested long-term funds in the tourism sector. BIDI has hotel loans
with terms of 10 to 12 years at 10 to 11 percent. These already constitute
about 10 percent of its portfolio, and BIDI is, therefore, reluctant to in-
crease its exposure in the sector any further. In these circumstances, the
Government has decided that Credit de la C6te d'Ivoire (CCI), a development
finance company 75 percent owned by the Government and already active in
housing and real estate, should process long-term lending for hotels in the
future.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
37.       In 1974 the Ivorian Government requested Bank assistance to develop
its tourism industry. The proposed project was identified and prepared by the
Bank in June 1974, appraised in November 1974, and negotiated from April 7 to 11,
1975. The Ivorian delegation was led by Mr. Naka, Director, CAA, and included
Messrs. Amichia, Director General CCI; Koffi, First Secretary of the Ivory Coast
Embassy; Chambard, Technical Adviser, Ministry of Finance; Preel, Technical Adviser,
BSIE; and Glorieux, Technical Adviser, Ministry of Tourism. A loan and project
summary is included in Annex 3. The Appraisal Report No. 666a-IVC of April 28,
1975, is being distributed separately.
Project Description
38.       The proposed project would consist of:
(a)  A line of credit for CCI to provide long-term loans for the con-
struction of new hotels;
(b) Technical assistance to CCI and to the Ministry of Tourism; and
(c)  A marketing study to review the country's tourism potential and
priority areas for touristic development.
39.       The proposed loan of US $9.7 million would be made to the Government,
which would relend the hotel credit component (US $9.0 million) through the
CAA in the form of a line of credit to CCI. The technical assistance part
(US $o.45 million) would be divided, one third to CCI to pay for a technical
adviser and two thirds to the Ministry of Tourism for two consultants. The.
funds for the marketing study (US $0.25 million) would also be used by the
Ministry of Tourism.
Credit de la C6te d'Ivoire
40.       CCI is a multipurpose development bank founded in 1955. It now has
a Government shareholding of 75 percent. Caisse Centrale de Coop6ration
Economique (CCCE) holds 17 percent, and BCEAO holds 8 percent. CCI finances
mainly housing, industry, trade, artisans, small household equipment, and auto-
mobiles. It provides short-, medium- and long-term loans, equity participa-
tions and guarantees to private or public corporations and individuals. While
CCI has had no direct experience in the hotel sector, the technical assistance
provided for under this project (paragraph 51) would help it to acquire the
necessary expertise. CCI is also expected to serve as intermediary for a pro-
posed small-scale enterprise Bank project currently under preparation.



- 12 -
41.       CCI's Board of Directors comprises nine Government-appointed
officials, two representatives from CCCE and one representative from the
Central Bank (BCEAO). The Board nieets about every two months and makes
decisions on only the most important loans.   A select committee (Comite
Restreint) decides on most other loans, and those below 2.5 million francs
CFA (about US$11,000) are approved by the Director General.
42.       CCI is well managed by a Director General who is appointed by the
Board. The institution has three main departments: (i) the Financial and
Administration Department, in charge of accounting and administration; (ii)
the Operations Department, consisting of three divisions, (a) the Technical
Division which supervises construction financed by CCI, (b) the Execution
Division which handles legal documents, disbursements and guarantees, and (c)
the Credit Division which prepares appraisals of all loans; and (iii) a
department headed by the Inspector General administrating CCI's four branch
offices.
43.       Resources   On September 30, 1974, CCI's capital and reserves amounted
to 2.3 billion CFA francs (US$10.2 million). The share capital will be increas-
ed in 1975 by 0.5 billion CFA francs (US$2.2 million). Medium- and long-term
debt outstanding accounted for 11.4 billion CFA francs (US$50.7 million) and
included funds from CCCE, CAA, USAID and BCEAO. CCI's debt-equity ratio which
currently stands at 5:1 will be limited to 8.3 to 1 (Section 4.04 of the Pro-
ject Agreement), which corresponds to BCEAO's guidelines for development banks.
For the purpose of the debt-equity ratio it has been agreed that only the
debts of those subsidiaries with activities similar or complementary to CCI's
would be consolidated. Loans from CCCE are long-term, loans from
CAA are short-, medium- and long-term, and the money from USAID is a long-
term loan for Ivorian enterprises. BCEAO lends medium- and short-term redis-
countable funds, currently at an interest rate of 5.5 percent. For its oper-
ations through September 30, 1979, CCI will require borrowings, net of repay-
ments, of about 11 billion CFA francs (US $49.0 million). BCFAO will finance
about 40 percent, CAA and the proposed Bank loans about 30 percent each.
44.       Portfolio  Loans outstanding on Sep`ember 30, 1974, totaled 13.6
billion CPA francs (US $60.4 million),   Housing accounted for 56 percent, in-
dustry and commerce for 17 percent, community facilities for 9 percent and
consumer financing for 11 percent. Four percent of all loans are classified
as "doubtful" and 2 percent are in litigation. This is a reasonable perfor-
mance. Provision is made for "doubtful" loans at 50 percent of face value
and at 85 percent for loans in litigation. CCI has also a general reserve
fund of about 1.1 billion CFAF francs (US $4.9 million).
45-.      Profitability   CCI, like most development banks in Frenchi-speaking
Africa, is not profit-oriented. Net income is mostly transferred to general
reserve accounts and the remaining nominal profit allocated to retained
earnings accounts. CCI's overall margin between its yield on loans and cost
of borrowings has remained between 3.0 to 3.5 percent.



- 13 -
The Line of Credit
46.       CCI would use the line of credit made available to it under the
proposed loan to provide long-term financing for a part of the foreign exchange
costs associated with its hotel construction projects. In the 1975-80 period
the proposed loan would help build hotels ranging in size from as small as 15
to as large as 400 rooms per establishment, totaling about 1,200 rooms.
47.       Hotel projects would generally be sponsored by local and foreign
private promoters, although this would not preclude some government participa-
tion. Most hotels under the project, particularly large-scale ventures, would
probably initially be managed by foreign companies although plans to
"Ivorianize" operations would be part of any management contract. Smaller
properties are expected to be promoted and managed directly by Ivorians. The
hotels would meet international business standards and have revenue potential
to cover any management fees and acceptable returns to investors and lenders.
Managers would be experienced hoteliers and would be encouraged to take an
equity participation in the hotels they manage.
48.       It was agreed that for hotels of less than 100 rooms, a typical
financial plan would consist of 20 to LO percent eauity, hO to 60 percent long-
term loans and about 20 percent medium-term loans. For hotels of more than
100 rooms, financing plans would call for about 40 percent equity, 40 percent
long-term loans and 20 percent medium-term loans (Schedule 1, "Policies and
Procedures" of the Project Agreement).
49-.      To protect CCI's financial independence and in accordance with its
by-laws, CCI's exposure to any one client will normally be limited to 25
percent of its net worth, which is expected to be increased to 2.8 billion
CFA francs in 1975, or about US$12.5 million.   Consequently, any hotel
requiring more than US $3.1 million equivalent in long-term funds would
need long-term financing from other sources as well. IFC could be a
potential investor.   CCCE and the Eiropean Investment Bank (EIB) have
also expressed interest in participating in individual hotel projects
starting in 1976.
50.       Hotel projects would be appraised by CCI; a suitable economic appraisal`-
methodology was discussed with the Bank during negotiations. CCI could uni-
laterally approve sub-projects of up to US$500,000 equivalent, not exceeding
an aggregate amount of US$2.5 million. Projects above this limit would be
subject to Bank approval. (Section 2.04(b) of the Project Agreement). The
terms of sub-loans would vary according to the type of project. In no case,
however, would maturities exceed 20 years, including a maximum of five years
of grace. The interest to sub-borrowers would be 10.5 percent plus a 1 percent
fee which would be passed on to the Government for its assumption of the foreign
exchange risk. This interest would allow a 2 percent spread for CCI to cover
administrative expenses and risks. This interest rate is in line with the
structure of interest rates in the Went, kfrican Monetary Union, of which the
Ivory Coast is a member.



- 14 -
Technical Assistance
51.        The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange cost for up to
two years of a technical adviser's services to CCI. This adviser - whose
qualificatlons and experience would have to be acceptable to the Bank (Section
2.02(a) of the Project Agreement) - would spend about two thirds of his time
assisting in the organization and appraisal of sub-projects and introducing
follow-up procedures. He would devote the balance of his time to the Small
Scale Ehterprise Project which is currently being prepared by the Bank for
execution by CCI.
52.       In addition, the Ministry of Tourism would appoint two consultants
with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank for a period of
up to two years. Their services would strengthen the Ministry in: (i) the
technical evaluation of hotel projects submitted to the Ministry, and (ii) on
the implementation of the marketing program mentioned below. They would also
provide technical and marketing advice to CCI (Sections 3.02(a) and 3.03 of the
Loan Agreement and Section 2.02(b) of the Project Agreement). The foreign
exchange cost of the two experts would be financed under the proposed loan.
Marketing Study
53.       The marketing study (36 to 40 man-months) would review the Ivory
Coast's tourism potential and priority areas for touristic development.
The study would also review current marketing activities carried out
by the Ministry of Tourism, SIETHO and ICTA. Along with developing
the concept of a marketing program, the study would review the ade-
quiacy of the Ministry's financial situation and recommend, as appropri-
ate, increased budgetary allocations, as well as distribution of funds among
its different departments. The marketing program would aim at strengthening
the tourism sector, particularly by developing methods to attract more
vacation tourists. The study would be carried out for the Ministry of
T!urism by con5-Jtants with qualitications and experience satisfactory to the
Bank, (Section 3.&'(b) of the Loan Agreement.)    Because of the importance of
qijieklv imnrovinr the Tvorv Cnntst's mqrketing effort, it was essential that
the marketing study get under way as soon as possible.    This study, for which
US t100,000 in retroactive financing is envisaged under this project, started
in April 1975.
Financing
54        Assuming that the approximately 1,200 rooms to be built under the
project between 1975 and 1980 would cost an average of US $40,000 per room, the
total cost of sub-projects would amount to approximately US$48 million, of
which about 40 percent would be required in the form of long-term lending.
The proposed line of credit would provide about half of these long-term funds



- 15 -
which is well within the estimated 55 percent foreign exchange component of
the project.  The exact percentage of Bank participation in each sub-project
would be determined by the size and cost of the hotel, as outlined in para-
graphs 48 and 19 of this report.
Disbursements
55.       The loan would finance only foreign expenditures and would be
disbursed as follows:
- 35 percent of the total cost of construction and site development
work of each sub-project;
- 100 percent of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment and furniture
and of the cost of the marketing study;
- 40 percent of the cost of locally purchased equipment and
furniture; and
- 80 percent of the cost of other technical assistance (representing
the estimated foreign exchange component).
The loan is expected to be fully committed by September 30, 1978, and disbursed
by September 30, 1981.
Procurement
56.       Generally procurement of goods and services as well as the awarding
of individual civil works contracts would be according to CCI's procedures,
which for the most part are acceptable to the Bank. However, since CCI has
rarely lent for individual projects as large as some of those expected to be
financed under the proposed loan, its established procedures do not adequately
cover the larger contracts. Therefore, civil works contracts estimated to be
in excess of US $1 million equivalent would be subject to international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. It is expected that most
civil works and furniture contracts would be won by Ivorian firms and other
equipment contracts by foreign suppliers.
Justification
57.       At present,-room occupancy in international hotels in Abidjan varies
between 75 and 85 percent, and there is already some turnaway demand during peak
periods. Business traffic, in particular, will continue to expand as the economy
grows and diversifies. According to current projections, total international
arrivals in the Ivory Coast should be about 157,000 by 1980, most of whom will
be business travelers. To meet this demand, our best estimate is that about
1,200 rooms will be required. The Government has informed the Bank of its
intent½on to periodically exchange views with the Bank on its investment policy
in the hotcl sector of the project area in order to avoid encouragement of addi-
tional investments which might lead to overcapacity and hamper the soun(d execution
of the project. The major constraint for hotel construction is the scarcity of long



- 16 -
term loans on suitable term-s.  By providing about half of these funds, the pro-
posed loan would make a significant contribution to the development of the sec-
tor. This, in turn, would support the Government's program to diversify export
earnings.
58.       Tn 1973 gross foreign exchaange earnings attributable to tourism
amounted to US $14 million (not including revenues from Air Afrique). They
are expected to reach US $36 million by 1983. Hotels financed with the help
of the proposed loan would generate annual revenues of about U1S $10 milliurn
by 1980, when about two-thirds of the hotels would be fully operational.
About 60 percent of these revenues would be net earnings and about P0 percent
would be in foreign exchange. While not all of these revenues would be
incremental, the newer and more modern accommodations would motivate business
visitors to extend their stay, thereby increasing their expenditures. The
new facilities -w,ould also stimulate vacation travel by removing the slurplv
constrainit.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES
5°.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Ivory Coast and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and CCI, the report to
the Cormrmittee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
60.       Features of the Loan and Project Agreements of special interest are
referred to in paragraphs 43, 48, and 50 through 53 of this report. The
appointments of the technical assistants referred to in paragraphs 51 and 52
are additional conditions of effectiveness (Section 6.01(c) and (d) of the
Loan Agreement).
61.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the 3ank.
PART VI - RCONThE.NDATION
62.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Implementation of this project was slow, especially in the initi5al years.
This resulted from (i) delays in the decision making process, especiallyf .or t}lo
selection and appointment ol consulting architects; (ii) the complexity of consul-
tations betueen international and bilateral donors on the s'eecifications of the
Instructional Television Production Center; and (iii) uncert6iinties about -tbe pro-
iect de,cr` pttion which culminated in its _renc'otuiation and 5,ndment in 197,1  The
au!endnofnt cnnsis led of (a) the reduction fromr 11 to 10 of the number of cducat-bn-al
institutions t.o be constructed under the project; (b) the deletion of Barnk financliSZ

In. No. 686         Cocoa Project: US $7.5 million Loan of June 5, 1970; C osing
Date:  September 30, 1977.
The Cocoa Loan has been amended to reduce the number of hectares to be
rehabilitated.  Difficulties arose in supervising large numbers of farmers who used
project inputs to treat non-project cocoa. The Government agreed to substantially
reduce the size of the rehabilitation programii. (See 1lemorandum to the Executive
Directors R73-74 of April 13, 1973.)  The project is proceeding satisfactorily except
for administrative problems which hive delayed the submission of requests for reim-
bursement. Hiowever, administration of this and the second project (Ln. 1096-Ivc) will
be combined, and an estimated 3,200 ha of cocoa plantings will be transferred from the
first to the second project.  Savings of US $2.2 million resulting from the amendment
(R73-74) and the merging of the two projects were cancelled at- the date of signature
of the second project.
Ln. No. 761    Second Hig h  Proect:US$20.5 million Loan of June 22, 1971;
..Closing Date: November 30, 1975.
A section of the Yabayo-Man Road will be rerouted due to present uncertaiin-
ties concerning the construction of a dam in the area of the rcad. (See M4emorandumi
to the Executive Directors R73-170 of July 6, 1973.)  Construction on the Man-Diekoue
and Bouake'-Katiola Roads is making good progress.  At the Government's req-uest,  a-nk
financing of the detailed engineering of the Katiola-Ferkessedougou Road was abandoned.
The road will be constructed under Go-vernrment financi..g.
Ln. No, 837    Third Hihp,  Pro'eet:  US .$17.5 milion Lorun of J=me 23, 1972;

The road maintenmace and betterment program has started.  A second call, for
bids for the reinforcement works had to be made, however, due, to inadequate sub,iis-
sions. The project incurred substantial cost overruns due tlx currency ralignients
and abnormal price escalation.  The Government is currently considering ways to solve
these problems.
Cr. No. 1,06   Fourth Hiuhway ProJect:  US $7.5 million Credit of June 28, 1973;

Road have been received and contracts awarded. This project is experiencing cost
overrunsS similar to those of the third project.

IVORY COAST - TOURISM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Borrower:                The Republic of the Ivory Coast
Principal Beneficiary:   Credit de la Cote dtIvoire (CCI)
Amount:                  US $9.7 million
Terms:                   Amortization of the proposed loan would substantially con-
form to the aggregate of the amortization schedules ap-
plicable to the specific investment projects financed out
of the proposed loan, none of which should exceed 2n -ears.
The loan would have an interest rate of 8.5 percent.
Project Description:     The proposed project would be carried out from 1975
to 1980 and would consist of:
a) A line of credit for CCI to provide long-term
loans for the construction of new hotels;
b) Technical assistance for CCI, the executing agency
and for the Ministry of Tourism; and
c) A marketing study.
Project Execution:       The loan (US $9.7 million) would be made to the
Government which would relend the hotel credit com-
ponent (US $9.0 million) through the Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement (CAA) in the form of a line of credit
to the Credit de la C6te d'Ivoire (CCI). The tech-
nical assistance part (US $0.5 million) would be
divided, one third to CCI to pay for the technical
adviser and two thirds to the Ministry of Tourism
for the two consultants. The funds for the market-
ing study (US $0.25 million) would also be used by the
Ministry of Tourism.

1/ Based on the assumption that about 1,200 hotel rooms, costing an
average of US $40,000 per room, would be built from 1975 to 1980.
2/ Assuming an average Bank participation in hotel construction of
about 20 percent of total project cost.
3/  Potential lenders are IFC, CCCE, EIB, and private sources.
Consultant's Services:   To carry out the marketing study financed under the proposed
loan, the Government will select consultants under terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank (36 to 40 man-months).
Procurement:             Generally, procurement of goods and services, as well
as the awarding of individual civil works contracts
would be according to CCI's procedures, which for
the most part are acceptable to the Bank. However,
since CCI has rarely lent for individual projects as
large as those expected to be finaxiced under the pro-
posed loan, its established procedures do not adequately
cover the larger contracts. Therefore, civil works con-
tracts estimated to be in excess of US $1 million equival-
ent would be subject to international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank guidelines. It is expected that
most civil works and furniture contracts would be won by
Ivorian firms and other equipment contracts by foreign
suppliers.
