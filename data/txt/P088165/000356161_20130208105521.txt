A. SUMMARY
This level 2 restructuring proposes changes based on the request of the Ministry of
Public Finance (MPF) to cancel the uncommitted loan amount (US$ 19,595,436.45)
for implementation of the remaining two activities under Part A.1 and Part B.2 of
the Loan Agreement. The activities are the Extended Technical Assistance for
Communities (US$4.2 million) and the Integrated System for the Issuance of Civil
Information, CIS (US$15.1 million), respectively. The request is motivated by the
difficulties in the last couple of years to provide the adequate budget allocation for their
implementation. The request is also motivated by the advanced discussions with the
European Commission to use European Structural Funds for implementing the Integrated
System for the Issuance of the CIS. The cancellation of the uncommitted loan proceeds
requires the following additional changes: (a) revising the description of Part B.2 of the
Loan Agreement to include only the consultant services that were financed by the project
for development of the CIS; and (b) dropping the outcome indicator and intermediate
results indicators related to the CIS, as well as to introducing result indicators to measure
what was financed. Cancelling the activity related to Part A.1 does not require any legal
changes. The cancellation does not require modification of the Project Development
Objectives (PDO).

B. PROJECT STATUS
The PDO is “to accelerate the participation of knowledge disadvantaged
communities in the knowledge based society and economy in Romania. To this end,
the Project will enable the Borrower to implement the National Strategy for the New
Economy and Implementation of the Information Society and the European Union
programs related to the information society for all.? Specifically, in targeted
disadvantaged communities, Local Community electronic Networks (LCeNs) would
evolve into a daily tool for education, business and public communication with the
Government, with increasing sustainability and private participation. The Knowledge
Economy project (US$60 million) was approved by the Board on November 29, 2005
and became effective on January 25, 2006. The project closing date is February 28, 2013.

The PDO is currently rated moderately satisfactory. Two of the three PDO outcome
targets have been met and exceeded, while limited progress has been made towards
implementing the G2C e-government service for civil status data and, as result, the
corresponding PDO outcome target1.

The Implementation Progress (IP) is rated unsatisfactory because of the low level of
commitments and disbursements. To-date, US$37.54 million (or 63%) has been
disbursed and an additional US$2.87 million is expected to be disbursed by the end of the

  The outcome indicator “Stage of the available online sophistication for the civil status e-Government
services, in line with the National strategy on Information society and EU Digital Agenda? was added as
part of the level 2 project restructuring approved in August 2011.
                                                  4
grace period (increasing the total to 67.35%). The remaining amount of about US$19.6
million, proposed for cancellation, represents the project budget for two activities,
namely the Extended Technical Assistance for Communities (US$ 4.2 million) under Part
A.1 and the e-Government services for the Integrated System for the Issuance of Civil
Information (US$ 15.1 million) under Part B.2 of the Loan Agreement.

The low level of commitments and disbursements was caused by the insufficient
project budget allocated to the Ministry of Communication and Information Society
(MCSI) through the State Budget law for 2011 and 2012. Starting January 1, 2009, the
World Bank applied the mechanisms of the Public Debt Management Law to its
portfolio, including to the Knowledge Economy project2, and project Special Accounts
were closed. The loan financed eligible expenditures were to be pre-financed out of state
budget allocations to the line Ministry and later to be reimbursed from the Bank’s loan in
accordance with the internal procedures of the Government. However, the budgetary
allocations for 2011 and 2012 were sufficient only for the disbursement of the amounts
committed under the existing contracts of the Knowledge Economy project and did not
allow new commitments and disbursements to complete the above two remaining
activities, despite the readiness of the bidding documents and although, as explained
above, these activities were planned to be financed 100% from the loan. The project is in
compliance with the financial management supervision arrangements and there are no
pending audits or unsatisfactory audits.

The Ministry of Public Finance requested the World Bank to extend the loan closing
date by 22 months3 to allow the completion of the two above activities. After a careful
review, the Bank did not concur. This was based on the project status, the rationale for
the request and associated risks. Reasons for rejection of the extension include: (a) the
previous difficulties in getting the necessary budgetary allocation for financing the two
remaining activities; (b) changes in the business and technical solution envisaged for
contracting the Integrated Civil Status Information System over the last three years; and
(c) advanced discussions with the European Commission for securing funds for financing
the implementation of the respective CIS System.

The proposed restructuring would be the third project restructuring. The first
restructuring was approved in June 2010 to allow the implementation of additional
sustainability measures within the originally planned activities related to the LCeNs,
aiming at mitigating the risks identified during project midterm review. The restructuring
consisted of: (a) the reallocation of 15 % of loan funds among existing expenditure
categories, by making full use of the project savings; and (b) the extension of the closing
date by 20 months to February 28, 2013. The second project restructuring approved in
August 2011 envisaged: (i) the increase of the loan proceeds to Part B of the Loan
Agreement to allow the implementation of the CIS with an increased scope and different
technical solution; (ii) the consolidation of all loan amounts into one single disbursement
expenditure category financed 100% from the loan proceeds to ensure more flexibility in

implementing the project; and (iii) the addition of new result and intermediate indicators
to reflect the contribution of the expanded scope of the CIS to the PDO.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

o Results/indicators:
Component 2 Intermediate Result and Indicators are changed to reflect the
cancellation of the Integrated System for the Issuance of Civil Information (US$15.1
million) activity and to measure the actual overall project investments under
Component 2 (or Part B of the Loan Agreement). Cancellation of the Extended
Technical Assistance for Communities (US$4.2 million) activity does not require
changes under Component 1 in the result framework, as explained below.

       The project has financed consultant services under component B 2 in the amount
        of US$0.8 million for (a) development of an online system for registration of
        businesses through the LCeNs (under Part B.1 of the Loan Agreement) and (b) the
        design of the technical solution and the procurement documents for a nation-wide
        Integrated System for the Issuance of Civil Information Status and the electronic
        communication infrastructure between all local Civil Status Offices and the
        central CIS databases through the state’s intranet (under Part B.2. of the Loan
        Agreement). The scope of (b) had been expanded in the August 2011
        restructuring to cover nation-wide deployment of the CIS instead of implementing
        it only through the selected LCeNs in the initial phase, as envisioned in the PAD.
        With the cancellation, the project will not finance the procurement of equipment
        and training to government authorities, and provision of internet service for
        county authorities to implement and deploy the integrated nation-wide system
        (the current Intermediate Result of Component 2) for which US$15.1 million had
        been allocated under the project.4 .

       The revised Intermediate Result under Component 2 is based on the above actual
        project investments (a) and (b). It describes how the knowledge built under the
        project contributed to enabling the business and citizens to use e-government
        services for business registration and for civil status information. The PDO Level
        Result Indicator No. 3 and the Intermediate Result Indicators No. 1-6 for
        Component 2 introduced in the level 2 restructuring approved in August 2011 are
        dropped because they measure the impact of implementing and deploying the
        nation-wide CIS system. Two new Intermediate Result Indicators for Component
        two measure what the project financed: (a) development of an online system for
        registration of businesses through the LCeNs, as well as (b) the design of the
        technical solution and preparation of the procurement documents for the CIS
        System. The cancellation does not require changes in the PDO.

       Cancellation of the Extended Technical Assistance for Communities activity in
        the amount of US$ 4.2 million under Component 1 (under Part A.1 of the Loan
        Agreement) does not require changes in the result framework. This assistance

  It should be noted that discussions are at an advanced stage with the EU to finance this system with EU
funds based on the procurement documents prepared under the project.
                                                   6
        aimed to further support communities in the implementation of the LCeNs
        sustainability plans and to disseminate the key lessons learnt from the project. The
        impact of the activity was going to be captured by the PDO Level Result
        Indicators No. 1 and 2 and by the Intermediate Result Indicator No. 1 that
        measure use and sustainability of the LCeNs.

o Components
The cancellation (see Results/Indicators) affects Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement,
as amended, in the following manner5:

       Part B: Development and Promotion of e-Government Services

        Part B.2: The description of Part B.2 is revised to include what was actually
        financed by the project, namely “consulting services to government authorities for
        the development of an integrated network for citizen status information and
        documentation?. With the cancellation of the Integrated System for the Issuance
        of Civil Information activity and closure of the project, the project will not
        finance the implementation of the CIS system though “provision of equipment
        and training to government authorities and provision of internet service for county
        authorities?. The reference to equipment and training to government authorities
        and provision of internet service for county authorities will be removed from the
        description of Part B.2 in the Loan Agreement.

In addition, at the Government’s request, the definition of “Incremental Operating
Costs? in paragraph 2.g of Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement is revised by adding
“archiving of Project documents? as an eligible expenditure. The description of Part D
(Component 4 - Project Management) remains the same in the Loan Agreement.

o Financing:
  o Project Costs: The costs of Part A and Part B are reduced due to the
     cancellation and the costs of Part D are lower reflecting the final
     disbursement status and exchange rate changes. The proposed project costs are
     shown below:

 Cancellation of the Extended Technical Assistance for Communities activity under Part A.1 of the Loan
Agreement does not require any modification in the Loan Agreement. It is removed from the procurement
plan.

       consists of the loan financing of the two last activities (Extended Technical
       Assistance for Communities and the Integrated System for the Issuance of Civil
