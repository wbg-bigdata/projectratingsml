F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project was to accelerate the participation of knowledge
disadvantaged communities in the knowledge-based society and economy in Romania.


                                                ii
Specifically, in targeted disadvantaged communities, Local Community e-Networks
(LCeNs) would evolve into a daily tool for education, business and public
communications with the Government, with increasing private management and financial
self-sustainability. To this end, the Project would enable the Borrower to implement the
National Strategy for the New Economy and Implementation of the Information Society,
and the European Union programs related to the information society for all. The project
aimed to achieve this objective in a three stage approach: first, to provide access and
internet connectivity through the establishment of Local electronic Community Networks
(LCENs) with access nodes in local schools, public administration, public libraries and
public point of access points (PAPIs); second, to provide technical assistance and
matching grants to increase the digital and other competencies of beneficiaries and
support firms to adopt e-business solutions and thus increase their participation in the
information society, and third, to improve the quality of use and benefits through the
provision of value added services (including through e-government services to citizens
and businesses).

  Two outcome indicators were set to measure the PDO achievement. Thus the project
envisaged that at least 40 percent of population in targeted communities used the LCeNs
as a tool for education, business or public administration and was satisfied with the
results, and at least 20 percent of the LCeNs operate as sustainable PPP (public private
partnerships) arrangements. The PAD envisaged the project to target at least 200
communities exhibiting the greatest knowledge disadvantage.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The Project Development Objectives were not revised during project implementation.

  The original PDO indicators were complemented in the 2011 (adoptive) restructuring
by adding a new PDO indicator to reflect the scaled up and changed technical solution of
the Integrated System for Civil Information Status (CIS) under the subcomponent 2.B.
This PDO indicator ("Stage of the available online sophistication for the civil status e-
Government services, in line with the National strategy on Information Society and EU
Digital Agenda") was chosen to better reflect the availability at the highest level of
sophistication of the G2C service (full two-way interaction between citizen and public
administration) among other e-government services available through LCeNs. This PDO
indicator was dropped in the 2013 restructuring that cancelled the financing of the
Integrated Network for CIS in view of availability of European Funds and project closure
(see Sections 1.6, 1.7, 2.2 and 3).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

Romania started the negotiations process for European Union (EU) in February 2000 and
since had committed to adopt the EU directives and strategies related to the development
and use of Information Communication and Technology (ICT) as a drive for economic
modernization. The Government of Romania (GOR) established a Task Force chaired by the
Prime Minister to lead this agenda. A National Strategy for the New Economy and the
Implementation of the Information Society (2002-2010), built on the European Lisbon Strategy1
was prepared and emphasized the need to: improve and expand the ICT enabled infrastructure
(broadband), including through public interventions for addressing the digital divide2 challenges;
increase the use of e-business solutions by firms and of e-government services to increase the
competitiveness of the firms and of the Romanian business environment; the development of
human resources and in particular of digital competencies to be able to compete in the European
and global markets; and, to achieve network security. The project was expected to use as
benchmarks the objectives, indicators and targets set by the European Digital Action Plans, 3
supporting the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.

The Government’s National Computer-Based Education System program (SEI) was
introduced in support of ICT education in upper secondary schools in 2001-2003. Under SEI,
high schools were provided with: (i) computers, standard software, and connectivity equipment,
plus technical support: (ii) educational software, content and knowledge management,
administrative support software platforms; (iii) educational multimedia content; and (iv) training
of teachers and administrators. The Government’s objective was to extend the penetration of
computers to basic and lower secondary schools, building on the lessons of the SEI project, given
that at the time only 20% of these schools had the desired level of equipment and trained teachers.

Romania was ranking behind other new EU members countries in terms of e-business
adoption by firms and the availability and uptake of e-government services by citizens and
businesses. The National Electronic System (SEN), launched in 2003, was designed to increase
the efficiency in the interaction with public administration, reduce costs for both public and
private entities and citizens, limit the potential for corruption, and increase public trust in the
administration. Except for the e-government system for public procurement, other key 4 e-
government services were not available nation-wide or were available at very basic sophistication



1
  The Lisbon Strategy, also known as the Lisbon Agenda or Lisbon Process, was an action and development plan
devised in 2000, for the economy of the European Union between 2000 and 2010 and called for transforming the EU
into “the most competitive knowledge based economy by 2010, capable to sustain economic growth by creating new
jobs and by the existence of an increased economic cohesion?. It was followed by the Europe 2020 Strategy adopted in
2010.
2
   The digital divide refers to “the gap between people with effective access to information and communications
technology (ICT), and those with very limited or no access?. The gap between people with Internet access and those
without is one of many aspects of the digital divide. Whether someone has access to the Internet can depend greatly on
financial status, digital competency, geographical location as well as government policies.
3
  e Europe 2005 action plan (launched in 2002) as a pillar for Lisbon Agenda and aimed to stimulate the development
of services, applications and contents while speeding up the deployment of secure broadband Internet access. There
was also the general aim of providing access for everyone in order to combat social exclusion, whether it is due to
particular needs or geographical disparities. It was continued with the i2010 initiative (launched in 2005) that set new
targets for 2011 and by Digital Agenda for 2020 (launched in 2011) as pillar in the Europe 2010 strategy.
4
  20 key e-government services G2C and G2B were defined as priority (12 for citizens and 8 for business).


                                                           1
level. Besides the development of the key e-government services major challenges were also to
scaling-up pilots and to increase the businesses and citizen’s awareness of and uptake of such
services.

The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Romania (2001) had identified accession to the
EU as a key priority for development and the Knowledge Economy (KE) Project supported
this objective by increasing the use of ICT technology as a means for economic
development, in line with the European Digital Action Plans. Although there were few
operations preceding the KE Project that related to knowledge economy activities5, none of them
tackled information society challenges in a coherent, focused, and strategic manner. This was the
underlying basis of the proposed Project and the Bank’s comparative advantage. Foreign donor
activities were fragmented and pilot-based, and overall, lacking a systemic, cross-sector
approach. It was assessed that the Bank, with its multi-sector approach, was able to advise the
Government on balancing public goods with private initiative.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The objective of the Project was to accelerate the participation of knowledge disadvantaged
communities in the knowledge-based society and economy in Romania. Specifically, in
targeted disadvantaged communities, Local Community e-Networks (LCeNs) would evolve
into a daily tool for education, business and public communications with the Government,
with increasing private management and financial self-sustainability. To this end, the Project
would enable the Borrower to implement the National Strategy for the New Economy and
Implementation of the Information Society, and the European Union programs related to the
information society for all. The project aimed to achieve this objective in a three stage approach:
first, to provide access and internet connectivity through the establishment of Local electronic
Community Networks (LCENs) with access nodes in local schools, public administration, public
libraries and public point of access points (PAPIs); second, to provide technical assistance and
matching grants to increase the digital and other competencies of beneficiaries and support firms
to adopt e-business solutions and thus increase their participation in the information society, and
third, to improve the quality of use and benefits through the provision of value added services
(including through e-government services to citizens and businesses).

Two outcome indicators were set to measure the PDO achievement. Thus the project
envisaged that at least 40 percent of population in targeted communities used the LCeNs as a tool
for education, business or public administration and was satisfied with the results, and at least 20
percent of the LCeNs operate as sustainable PPP (public private partnerships) arrangements. The
PAD envisaged the project to target at least 200 communities exhibiting the greatest knowledge

  Knowledge typologies for communities were defined as part of the project social assessment. PAD contains an
additional reference (page 59) that about 45 percent of the communities exhibiting the greatest K-knowledge
disadvantage would be eligible for inclusion in the project. 255 communities were thus selected for initial project
interventions.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The Project Development Objectives were not revised during project implementation.

The original PDO indicators were complemented in the 2011 (adoptive) restructuring by
adding a new PDO indicator to reflect the scaled up and changed technical solution of the
Integrated System for Civil Information Status (CIS) under the subcomponent 2.B. This
PDO indicator ("Stage of the available online sophistication for the civil status e-Government
services, in line with the National strategy on Information Society and EU Digital Agenda") was
chosen to better reflect the availability at the highest level of sophistication of the G2C service
(full two-way interaction between citizen and public administration)7 among other e-government
services available through LCeNs. This PDO indicator was dropped in the 2013 restructuring that
cancelled the financing of the Integrated Network for CIS in view of availability of European
Funds and imminent project closure (see Sections 1.6, 1.7, 2.2 and 3).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The project main beneficiaries as described in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) were:
(i) the population at large in the 255 targeted knowledge disadvantaged communities beneficiaries
of the project interventions, representing about 1.09 million people; (ii) the schools and public
libraries, the teachers and students within the selected communities; and (iii) the local public
administrations of the selected communities and the LCeNs staff (managers, IT administrators);
and (iv) the self-employed, family associations, micro, small and medium enterprises. In addition
the staff of the Ministry of Communication and Information Society (MCIS), the Ministry of
Public Administration and Interior (MAI), Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport
(MERYS), the National Agency for Small and Medium Size Enterprises (NASME), the Ministry
of Culture and Religious Affairs (MCRA) and of the National Trade Registry (NTR) were
indirect beneficiaries of the knowledge created under project, but also partners in the
implementation of the project.

1.5 Original Components

Component 1: Access to ICT in knowledge disadvantaged communities and improved
digital literacy (US$ 43.1 million; loan proceeds US$ 37.0 million)

The objective of this component was to provide to the people living in the targeted
communities increased access to and meaningful use of ICT-enabled infrastructure and
services through the supply of physical equipment and internet connectivity and provision
of technical assistance. This expected to enhance the human and social capabilities of people in
these communities and would have increased the benefits from using the LCeNs enabled services.
This objective supported the National Strategy for Information Society’s objective to reduce the
digital divide between targeted rural and small urban areas and the rest of the country and thus
helped accelerate the participation of such knowledge disadvantaged communities in the
knowledge-based society and economy in Romania. These objectives were to be achieved
through three sub components:



7
  No indicator to measure the uptake by citizens was proposed given the impact that could be achieved in the limited
time until the end of the project.


                                                         3
Subcomponent 1.A: Improving access by establishing Local Community e-Networks (LCeNs). The
purpose of this component was to help establish at least 200 multi-purpose local e-networks
(LCeNs) that would serve as “knowledge-centers?, providing information, services and benefits
to citizens and small businesses in selected knowledge disadvantaged communities.

Subcomponent 1.B: Digital literacy for communities. This sub-component was to support
activities which promote increased access to ICT and e-services via LCeNs. The focus was on
how emerging ICT technologies can provide practical benefits, how to apply them to business
processes, and how to find appropriate sources of help to do so. This would be helped through
technical assistance and training programs.

Subcomponent 1.C: Digital literacy for schools. This sub-component was to focus on the
enhancement of digital competencies within primary and lower secondary education levels
through the integration of the ICT into the classroom, thereby improving teachers and students’
skills and knowledge. This was to be achieved through the provision of technical assistance at
national level for ICT in education policy formulation, and at local level, through the utilization
of LCeN nodes that are based in schools and local public libraries.

Component 2: Development and promotion of e-government services (US$ 8.8 million; loan
proceeds US$ 7.0)

The objective of this component was to enhance the accuracy and reduce the time of
interaction between citizens and business and the Government through the deployment of
two selected e-government services namely: (i) for the online business registration of family
associations and self-employed and (ii) for civil status information and documentation. This
objective was to be achieved through two sub-components:

Sub-component 2A: Online system for notifications and authorizations of local businesses. This
subcomponent was to help the development of an online system for the registration of family
associations and self-employed individuals that, according to the legislation at the time, were to
use local administrations as intermediaries in the registration process. The system would have
enabled such businesses to get information on the relevant registration legislation and forms by
accessing the sites of the public administration or of the National Trade Registry; in addition,
local authorities would have used the internet to electronically send to and receive from the
National Trade Registry the documentation and confirmation of business registration respectively,
thus would have reduced the time of business registration. LCeNs nodes (Public Administration
Points or PAPIs and local administration) were going to be used as access points.

Sub-component 2B: Integrated network civil information and documents. This subcomponent
would have allowed citizens to apply online and receive civil status certificates, such as birth and
marriage certificates, and thus to ensure more efficient interactions with the public authorities and
more accurate transactions and records of the civil status central data-basis of the Ministry of
Administration and Interior. The system was to be initially implemented in the communities
targeted by the project with the objective to scale it up to national level.

Component 3: Promotion of e-commerce and innovation support for MSMEs (US$ 11.9
million; loan proceeds US$ 11.3 million)

The objective of this component was to facilitate businesses access to knowledge through the
development of an e-Portal for e-commerce and business networking and the adoption by


                                                 4
firms of innovative business solutions, including the ICT based. This objective would be
achieved through two sub-components:

Sub-Component 3.A: Portal for promotion of e-commerce and business networking. The e-Store
portal was to provide MSMEs with relevant information, how-to tools, training, consulting,
references and other resources for developing e-business competency, to share knowledge, and to
establish contacts for commercialization of new technologies, the development of supply chains
and business solutions. In particular, the e-Store was to assist in the development of opportunities
in knowledge disadvantaged areas, by providing these communities and businesses with better
access to information, foster socio economic development and give local producers access to
market information.

Subcomponent 3.B: Grant Facility. The Facility was to provide grants to individual small and
medium enterprises, self-employed persons (SEPs) and family associations (FAs), enterprise
associations and clusters (or consortia of these clients) to facilitate e-business adoption and
improve the competitiveness of Romanian firms in domestic and foreign markets.

Component 4: Project management

This component was to finance the incremental operating costs of the Project Management
Unit (PMU) within the Ministry of Communication and Information Society (MCIS), provision
of vehicles and consultants services for audits and for the monitoring and evaluation of the
project.

1.6 Revised Components

Some components were revised through restructurings approved by Bank management, as
described below, to adjust to changed circumstances at the request of the Borrower:

1.7 Other significant changes

Extension of the closing date: The closing date was extended by 20 months from June 30,
2011 to February 28, 2013 to allow the implementation of the original project activities
while including additional sustainability measures aimed at mitigating the risks towards
achieving the original PDO, as identified by project Mid-term review (MTR). The proposed
changes fell under the original PDO. By MTR the first stage towards meeting the PDO (access)
had been successfully achieved through the establishment of the LCeNs in 255 communities and
the activities planned under the last two project stages (use – benefits) were in different stages of
implementation. Four major original activities were still in the planning stage as they were
following the general path and sequence corresponding to the staged approach envisaged under
the project. The additional sustainability measures to support the original activities included: (i)
intensified assistance to communities to reduce the large variation of ICT resource utilization and
service delivery in LCeNs and to ensure their sustainability under Component 1A; (ii) intensified
provision of technical assistance (TA) in schools for integrating the ICT in the education process,
while addressing the sustainability of such interventions by anchoring them to the national
policies and programs under subcomponent 1B; and (iii) provision of TA to businesses to
increase the quality of project proposals in the second call under the grant facility subcomponent
3.B. The extension was also requested to implement the original CIS system under subcomponent
2.B due to significant delays (about 30 months) from the original timetable because of difficulties
in agreeing on the technical and business specifications solution, mainly driven by security
concerns expressed by the Ministry of Public Administration and Interior. The extension was
approved because the subcomponent remained highly relevant for the country as its
implementation contributed to achieving the commitments made under the European Agenda
i2010 and correlated with other European projects such as the issuance and exchange of civil
status documents and information among all EU member countries in view of free circulation of
persons in the Shengen space.

Reallocations: There were two reallocations of loan funds approved by Bank management
in June 2010 and August 2011 (see Annex 1.c):

        The restructuring approved in June 2010 reallocated US$ 10.5 million of savings (or
         15% of the loan) among categories of expenditures, while maintaining the original
         allocation of the loan proceeds by components. The loan allocation for the operating
         costs was reduced from the original US$8.5 million to zero because the operational and
         maintenance costs of LCeNs under the component 1 were financed by local governments


                                                       7
        or covered under existing contracts under the project (Section 1.6). Under the grant
        facility subcomponent 3.B, the loan allocation for grants was reduced from US$9 million
        by US$1.8 million because it became essential to mitigate with TA the low capacity
        (knowledge and resources) of firms to prepare and implement projects, further aggravated
        by the current economic context. The savings were used to finance additional
        sustainability measures described in the above paragraph.

       The restructuring approved in August 2011 contained three major changes. First,
        the second call of funds under the grant facility subcomponent 3.B was cancelled because
        EU grant funds were available in an amount of about EUR 151 million to finance the
        adoption of e-business solutions by firms. The savings were reallocated to finance the
        expended scope of the subcomponent 2.B “Integrated network civil information and
        documents?. The proposed approach envisaged: (i) nation-wide implementation of the
        system in one stage (vs. gradual scaling up of the system, as envisioned in the PAD),
        implying that the project was to cover 3,210 Territorial Civil Offices compared to 255
        KE Project communities planned for the initial stage; and (ii) use of state intranet vs.
        internet as a channel of communication between local administration and the central
        Government infrastructure (Government-to-Government (G2G) (Section 1.6). The total
        costs for implementing the new Integrated System for the Issuance of Civil Information
        (CIS) subcomponent country-wide were estimated to about US$ 15 million to cover the
        hardware and software equipment for 3,210 offices and for their connectivity to the
        intranet of the state (vs. the initial budget of US$ 8.8 million). The restructuring did not
        affect the objective of this subcomponent or the PDO since: (i) the project aimed to
        “finance the full scale implementation and deployment of the G2C service being piloted
        through the use of LCeNs as the primary means of access, prior to full-scale up
        deployment on a national level? but envisaged a phased approach, and (ii) the project
        supported the implementation of the National Strategy for Information Society and the
        European Union programs related to information society and e-Government service for
        CIS as one of one of the 20 key e-government services envisaged by the strategy. The
        project continued to finance the original activities except for internet services.

Cancellation: At the request of the Ministry of Public Finance (MPF), the uncommitted
amount of US$19,595,436.45 was cancelled from the loan in the restructuring approved by
Bank management in February 2013 (see Annex 1.c). It included the amounts allocated for the
Extended TA for Communities for the sub-component 1.A included in the restructuring approved
in August 2011 (US$4.2 million, see (i)-(iii) under “Extension of the closing date?) and the
original and reallocated amounts for the Integrated System for the Issuance of Civil Information,
CIS (US$15.1 million) under the sub-component 2.B. The request was motivated by the
difficulties in 2010-2012 to provide the adequate Government budget allocation for their
implementation (see section 1.7 Project Financing). The request was also motivated by the
advanced discussions with the European Commission to use European Structural Funds for
implementing the CIS.

Project financing: With the cancellation approved by Bank management in February 2013,
the loan financing was reduced from US$60 million to US$40.4 million and the Borrower
contribution from US$10 million to US$8.9 million (see Annex 1). The main cause leading to
cancellation was the insufficient state budget allocation for 2011 and 2012 to pre-finance the loan
eligible expenditures and to allow new commitments (see Section 2.2.) in the context of financial
crisis.




                                                 8
Disbursement arrangements: The August 2011 restructuring also reallocated all the
uncommitted loan amounts from the existing expenditure categories into one new single
disbursement expenditure category financed 100% from the loan proceeds. This was
motivated by the need for an increased flexibility for implementing the project and the exhaustion
of the Government contribution. All contracts under implementation continued to be financed
under the category of expenditure valid at the time of contract signing.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background analysis. Lessons learnt from previous sector projects were
adequately reflected in project design and positively affected the implementation and
project outcomes, mainly: (i) the successful Bank experience in working with communities was
reflected in project design through demand driven process for establishing the LCeNs and the
decentralization of LCeN resources and responsibilities to the beneficiary local administration;
(ii) the path taken by many countries in their efforts to develop the information society was
reflected by the approach employed by the project to achieve the development objective in three
stages (access, use, benefits); (iii) the efficiency of balancing of needs of the communities
(bottom-up) and the objectives of the Government (top-down), while ensuring the ownership and
commitment and local level was reflected in designing the competitive selection process of the
project beneficiary communities among the target group (by including the competition) and in
involving local civil servants (teachers, librarians, LCeN managers, public administration clerks),
private sector and civil society representatives to be involved in the creation of the content and
architecture of the LCeNs; (iv) the use of Banks analytical work and best practices in
emphasizing the need for coordination in the implementation of the project on both Bank side
(different departments working together) and from the Government’s side (coordination of a
number of institutions); (v) the emphasis from the start on the need to focus on sustainability of
the LCeNs, and forging their partnerships with private sector in a way that meets the needs of
community and generate greater knowledge, technical and financial support in the long run.

Assessment of project design. The project was well designed to assist Romania to meet its
commitment under the EU programs related to information society for all and implement
its own National Strategy for New Economy and Implementation of the Information Society,
through a coherent set of interventions aiming to: (i) increase access to ICT and improve digital
literacy in knowledge disadvantage communities, (ii) promote e-government services and (iii)
promote e-commerce and innovation support for private sector (small and medium enterprises).
Alternative approaches were duly considered and clear reasons for rejection were given to both
technical solutions (such as a low technology solution with a single node versus complex multi -
purpose node LCeNs) as well as to funding and recovery models for the LCeNs (such as a wholly
private sector model, wholly public or mixed public-private with a strong public good
component). The project design was based on previous work8 on knowledge and digital divide in
Romania and on comprehensive sociological studies carried out by the Bank team during 2004-
2005 during project preparation. Knowledge-typologies (K-Typologies) of the communities in
Romania were thus defined which proved to be essential for targeting the most knowledge-
disadvantaged communities for assistance under the project. In addition, the design was tested9 in

    Financed from the WB Knowledge Innovation Fund

    Financed from the Project Advance Facility



                                                     9
nine communities and lessons learnt were incorporated in the scale up selection process. The
PDO was clear, ambitious and important for the country and the Bank (see Section 1.1) and led to
the reduction or even elimination (see Section 3.2) of the digital divide between the communities
targeted and the rest of the country, as envisaged by the Information Society Strategy. The three
stage approach (access-use-benefits) was appropriate; however the challenge was in achieving the
very ambitious targets set for the PDO indicators in the original life time of five years. The
components were relevant for achieving the PDO, and technical assistance activities were
envisaged to address the knowledge needs and coordination challenges given the technical
complexity the interventions, the high number of organizations involved at central and local level
and their geographic dispersion, the novelty of the project in Romania, and the limited capacity
for implementation, particularly at community level.

Adequacy of Government commitment and stakeholders’ involvement. Project preparation
oversight was ensured by a Steering Committee led by a strong Minister of MCIS – as
National Coordinator for the implementation of the Information Society Strategy; and
consisted of high level representatives (at Secretary State level) from relevant ministries
(MERYS, MAI, NASME and MCRA). This commitment allowed the proper anchoring and
alignment of the project objectives and interventions in the relevant country strategies and
policies. In addition, the 255 Local administrations, transparently selected as beneficiaries of the
project, demonstrated significant level of ownership (such as assumed obligations for LCeNs
governance, management, staffing and sustainability) that proved critical during implementation.

Assessment of risks. Risks were generally adequately identified and mitigated both at the
level of PDOs as well as to component results, including: (i) project’s complexity,
interdependence among components and multi-sector nature; (ii) poor understanding and lack of
support from communities and lack of stakeholders; (iii) timing of LCeNs becoming fully
operational; (iv) access to ICT and improved Digital Literacy; (v) interest of communities in
supporting LCeNs; (vi) e-government institutional capacity; (vii) promotion of e-commerce and
innovation support to MSME; and (viii) Project management. By the project’s Mid-term review,
the risks were reassessed and additional risk mitigation measures were implemented in the project
(see 1.7). An important risk factor was the impact of the Eurozone financial crisis that affected
negatively the budget of the Government of Romania (see Section 2.2). Even though this risk was
not foreseen in the projects’ design, the Bank team raised constantly the necessity of proper
budgetary allocations from the side of the MPF on project level.

No Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) of the project was carried out for this project.

2.2 Implementation

Factors outside the control of government or implementation agencies:

       The policy commitments derived from Romania’s accession to the European Union
        in 2007 have determined important modifications in the project context since
        appraisal, mainly with positive impact towards achieving the development objective
        and ensuring the sustainability of interventions. Thus, the EU’s “Renewed Lisbon
        agenda strategy for growth and jobs? followed by the EU 2020 Strategy (and related
        i2010 and Digital Agenda pillars) reinforced the relevance of the project development
        objective and increased the need for appropriating the relevant EU policy frameworks at
        national level. In addition, the availability of European Structural Funds after accession
        diversified the country’s choices to finance development priorities, with a clear option to



                                                10
         maximize the funding from EU grant sources. The project was affected in different
         ways: (i) the second call for the Grant Facility for SMEs was cancelled (as part of the
         2011 restructuring) in view of the EUR 151 million available for similar objectives.
         Savings obtained were reallocated for the scaled up CIS under subcomponent 2B; (ii) the
         technical assistance for communities included, as part of the LCeN sustainability
         interventions, value added services aiming at absorbing EU funds for local economic
         development objectives. This resulted in the attraction by project communities of about
         EUR 250 million with a positive impact on achieving the level of perceived benefits
         targeted by the PDO objective and increasing the sustainability of LCeNs; (iii) the online
         business services was implemented country wide with European Funds, and (iv) the
         implementation of the CIS, cancelled as part of the 2013 restructuring and in view of
         project closure, is financed with EU funding and procurement process is expected to be
         launched in August 2013.

        The global financial crises affected Romania and forced the authorities to embark
         on a severe austerity program, particularly after 2009. In this context the Government
         implemented drastic cost reduction measures that affected the pace of implementation
         and also led to cancellation of project activities (see section below).

Factors generally subject to Government control:

        The application, starting January 1, 2009 of the mechanisms of the Public Debt
         Management Law to the whole World Bank investment lending portfolio (including
         to the KEP) required that the loan financed eligible expenditures be pre-financed
         out of state budget allocations to the line Ministry and later to be reimbursed from the
         Bank’s loan in accordance with the internal procedures of the Government. Special
         Accounts were closed and direct payments out of the loan proceeds were no longer
         possible. While this mechanism was beneficial for moving towards country systems, it
         increased the risks for project delays in case of inappropriate levels for advanced
         financing to cover loan and counterpart funding needs.

        The budgetary constraints imposed by the Government, in response to the financial
         crisis, impacted negatively the smooth implementation of the project. The low level
         of commitments and disbursements in 2010-11 and the cancellation of loan funds in 2013
         were mainly caused by the insufficient project budget allocated to the MCSI through the
         State Budget law for 2011 and 201210. Thus, the budgetary allocations for 2011 and 2012
         were sufficient only for the disbursement of the amounts committed under the existing
         contracts of the KEP and did not allow new commitments and disbursements to complete
         the last activities, despite the readiness of the bidding documents and although these
         activities were planned to be financed 100% from the loan (see “Cancellations? in
         Section 1.7). The World Bank mission discussed with the Client the details of the
         restructuring request (that included also a different technical solution for the CIS), and
         was reassured by the Ministry of Public finance that the needed budget would be made



10
  By the time of the project second restructuring (August 2011) the Implementation Progress was downgraded to
Moderately Satisfactory given the slowdown of the project activities mainly due to insufficient budget allocation for
both loan funds withdrawal and counterpart funding (rated Unsatisfactory). The project Implementation was rated
Unsatisfactory by the time of third restructuring (February 2013), due to the same reason. The affected components
were: (1 A) the Extended Technical Assistance for Communities (US$4.2 million) and (2B) the Integrated System for
the Issuance of Civil Information, CIS (US$15.1 million).


                                                        11
           available during the September 2011 revisions and that the budget for the year 2012
           would be appropriate for the project’s needs. The budget was not provided. This affected
           negatively the project implementation and caused cancellation of the
           activity/subcomponent 2.B (CIS). In addition, as part of the cost reduction measures, the
           Government adopted in 2010 various legislative acts that affected the status and reduced
           the level of salaries of the PMU staff. As result, all core PMU staff resigned, except the
           PMU Director. This situation created a serious short term implementation capacity
           problem. This issue was resolved by the end on 2010 by filling in the core positions
           (procurement, financial management, etc.) and relying more on the consulting services
           for ensuring the facilitation at local level.

          The Steering Committee functioning was affected by the numerous changes in the
           Government and affected the pace of project implementation. Since project appraisal,
           nine Ministers of Communication and Information Society changed function and the
           numerous changes in the composition and the leadership of the Steering Committee
           affected the pace of project implementation. Delays in decision-making occurred given
           the time needed by the newly appointed persons to understand the project. However, the
           relevance of the project objective and design were not altered by these changes.

          The 2011 Decision of the Supreme Council of Defense 11 on ICT systems
           interoperatibility within the state required that all local administration offices were
           to be connected into an intranet network owned and managed by the state through
           the Special Telecommunication Service. This decision affected the approach and
           technical solution for the CIS. As result, and despite the advanced stage, the bidding
           process for procuring the CIS was stopped in February 2011. The implementation of the
           new technical solution that observed the requirements of the Supreme Council of
           Defense’s decision necessitated the project restructured in August 2011 (Sections 1.6-7).

Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

The activity of the Steering Committee and of the Project Implementation Unit was affected
by the factors beyond their reach as described above, and foremost by the insufficient
budget allocation to pre-finance project activities in 2011 and 2012 which led to delays in
implementation and cancellation of loan funds (2013 restructuring). However, the PMU, and in
spite of the temporary shortages and of cross sectorial and multi-level coordination challenges,
was effective and instrumental in the implementation of the project. The PMU management and
staff were of high professional quality and dedicated to project objectives. The technical
assistance was effectively used and monitoring and evaluation systems were put in place and
effectively used.

Mid Term Review (MTR). The MTR took place in October 2008 and provided a series of
critical actions necessary for ensuring the achievement in a sustainable way of the
development objective and the need for urgent decisions that led to project restructuring.
Such recommendations addressed issues aiming to anchor the project interventions in national
policies (national strategy for Information society, the Lifelong Learning and Education strategy,
and Policy ICT in Education) and e-government programs (Online registration of businesses), to

     Organism under Romania Presidency and accountable to Parliament




                                                       12
increase the sustainability of the LCeNs, to use M&E to benchmarks project achievements to
national and European strategic documents, to improve project coordination and management
oversight, to ensure appropriate budget allocation, etc.

Project changes/restructuring. The project was restructured three times to resolve
implementation delays or adjust to changed project circumstances: June 2010, August 2011 and
February 2013. The restructurings were necessitated by the need to support the original project
activities with additional sustainability measures as identified by Mid-term review, the need to
observe the decision of the Supreme Council of Defense that delayed the implementation and
changed technical solution regarding the CIS system under the sub-component 2.B, and the
availability of EU funding (see Sections 1.6 and 1.7). In terms of effectiveness of restructurings
on improving implementation and outcomes, the project extension and the implementation of the
additional sustainability measures as to the TA for communities and TA for schools positively
influenced the achievement of the PDO and increased the sustainability of the project. The CIS e-
government service planned under the project would have increased the availability of e-
government services, but its uptake and derived benefits at the level of population, as reduced
time and cost of interaction with the Government, would not have been observable within the
project life. Therefore, the cancellation of the CIS e-government service activity under Part B did
not impact the achievement of the PDO which relies on actual project achievements. After a
careful review, the Bank did not agree with the Government request for a second extension to
allow the implementation of the CIS given the availability of EU funds to implement it. At the
time of restructurings, the loan disbursement status was as follows: US$26.4 million (2010),
US$32.8 million (2011) and US$ 37.5 million (2013).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design: The original result framework included a fair amount of indicators: two
PDO indicators and seven component indicators. Data was obtainable partially from
planned surveys or implementation monitoring. Most component indicators were reasonable
measures of outputs (grants, MSMEs, SEPs and FAs participating in e-Store activities) or of
progress towards LCeNs sustainability objective (in line with development plans), although some
indicators measuring use of the ICT were harder to measure (number of trainees who acquired
basic literacy skills or used new skills in the classrooms, or improvement in time and accuracy for
individuals to complete their transactions through e-government service – for which no base line
was available).

The Mid-term review stressed on the need to anchor the project results framework in the
updated European frameworks and National Strategy for Information Society by using the
i2010 indicators and targets as benchmarks for the KE project, as initially envisaged by the
PAD. Thus, two PDO sub-indicators were introduced to better explicit and benchmark PDO 1
(which measured satisfaction from the utilization of LCeNs) by proving information on the
percentage of population regularly using the internet12 (measuring improved of ICT use) and
percentage population using e-government services13 (measuring improved quality of ICT use).
The benchmark allowed to better measure the project contribution to achieving the objective set



12
   Percentage of relevant population (16-74 years) who accessed internet on average at least once a week, within the
last three months before the survey
13
   Percentage of relevant population (16-74 years) using the internet for obtaining services from public authorities
websites, for downloading official forms, for sending filled in forms within the last 12 months before survey for private
purposes.


                                                          13
by the i2010 agenda of halving in 2011 the distance (as of 2005) between the average ICT use of
EU population and the average ICT use of Romania population, in addition to measuring the
achievement of the e-inclusion objective of reducing/eliminating the digital divide between
disadvantaged communities and national averages in Romania.

Originally there was no separate PDO indicator for the e-government services in the
original PAD (as a contribution of component 2); use and satisfaction of e-government
services were included as part of measuring the LCeNs and did not differentiate on the type
or coverage (local or national) of e-government service. The new PDO indicator introduced in
the August 2011 restructuring to reflect the level of sophistication and scaled up approach of the
G2C service to be implemented by the project was considered appropriate as it is used by the EC
to measure and benchmark the progress of implementing i2020 G2C/G2B services across the EU
member states. In addition, six component indicators were appropriately introduced to measure
the efficiency, accuracy and integrity of the system to be implemented under the revised
subcomponent 2B. This PDO indicator and the six subcomponent indicators were dropped in
February 2013 restructuring to reflect the cancellation the procurement of the Integrated System
for the Issuance of Civil Information Status under the subcomponent 2.B (Sections 1.6-1.7).

The project Mid-term review also stressed on the need to better capture the project
activities for the integration of the ICT in schools (under subcomponent 1C) and a new
component indicator was introduced. This was a composite indicator of ten sub-indicators that
capture the multiple dimensions/outputs of project activities at school level and at national level
(see Annex 2, SubComponent 2C). The collection of the data was conducted by the MERYS and
was based on self-assessments of the schools participating in the project.

M&E implementation: The implementation of the M&E was fully in place by 2008, after the
establishment of the 255 LCeNs. Given the large number of communities to be covered
comprehensive data was collected annually using surveys. Quarterly reports (covering 85
communities at a time) and in-depth case studies (covering 16 communities at a time) were
prepared based on field visits on a rotation basis. In 2008 the MERYS introduced the
implementation of self-assessment questionnaires to the 516 schools participating in the project.
Data was collected annually. In addition, a separate monitoring and evaluation system was
implemented to measure the progress and impact of the activities under subcomponent 3B (Grant
Facility). Finally, to measure the overall project impact, by end 2012 Household and Institutional
Surveys were implemented in a representative sample 14 of 57 communities out of the 229
communities that remained in the project. Primary data were collected both at the micro
(individual, household) level and meso (community) levels through quantitative and qualitative
research techniques. In addition, for counterfactual evidence, the household survey was applied in
a sample of 20 rural communities that were not project beneficiaries, but that displayed similar
initial conditions as the communities included in the project.

M&E utilization: The project’s implementation benefitted from the close monitoring and
evaluation, as reflected in all Aide Memoires and ISRs and project documentation. Collected data
was used to better define the interventions and allocate resources (as for example the TA for
communities and the TA for schools), to inform decisions making at both local and central level
on shortcomings and/or achievements and trigger decisions such as reallocations, cancellations,
etc. The data collected from the Household and Institutional Surveys were used to assess the
project overall impact, and in particular for the achievement of the PDO. In addition, the data was

     95% confidence level and 1.9% margin error


                                                  14
used to share good practices in Romania and to report on achievements relevant to European
agendas.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Assessment Category (EA). Not Required.

Fiduciary compliance

Procurement. Overall rating for procurement throughout the project life is Satisfactory. At
all times the project had procurement plans that were appropriately monitored and used for
decision making. This allowed proper coordination among the different activities, in particular at
local level. However, during the period 2010-2012 the overall implementation progress was
undermined mainly by the insufficient budget allocations from the MPF and in spite of the
bidding documents readiness, as no new procurement could be launched (see also Section 2.2).

Financial Management. Overall rating for financial management is Satisfactory. The rating
for FM was satisfactory throughout the project life and this included project accounting and
reporting arrangements, staffing, internal control procedures, planning budgets and internal and
external audits. The project was in compliance with its annual audits and quarterly reporting
covenants. The audits were clean, with no internal control issues, and the final audit covering the
year 2012 and the final period ended June 17, 2013 was received and accepted in early July 2013.
The assessment on “counterparts funding? was downgraded to moderately satisfactory in 2011
and to unsatisfactory in 2012 due to insufficient budget allocation to pre-finance eligible
expenditures (for both loan and counterpart contribution - see also Section 2.2). Following the
2013 restructuring and the sufficient budget allocation for covering the remaining project
payments until the closing date and subsequent four months graced period, the rating was
upgraded to satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The e-government service for Civil Information Status (CIS), dropped from the project
during February 2013 restructuring, is planned to be implemented nation-wide with EU
grants. The financing agreement was approved and the procurement (ICB) will be launched in
August 2013 through the e-procurement RO Portal. The implementation of the system is
envisaged to take two years.

The grant facility for SMEs, discontinued from the project as part of the August 2012
restructuring, continues with financing from the EU grants in total value of EUR 151
million. So far EUR 12 million has been contracted and about 650 projects are in different phases
of evaluation. A similar program is envisaged to be financed during the next EU financial
program 2014-2020.

The World Bank is further involved by providing technical assistance to MCIS for
developing the Digital Agenda strategy for the period 2014-2020. In particular, following the
experience gained during the development of the eGovernment services and the Bank’s global
knowledge assistance was requested for addressing interoperatibility issues. The assistance is
provided through Regional Technical assistance for Smart specialization.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of objectives

The PDO is highly relevant to the current country development priorities. The project is
fully supported the National Reform Strategy and the European EU 2020 Strategy (and its related
Digital Agenda flagship initiative). The project’s indicators and measurements are consistent with
key performance indicators used by the EC to benchmark the progress of each EU member states
towards the European Digital Agenda goals and targets. The PDO is also aligned to the current
Country Partnership Strategy FY09-FY13 and Progress Report that supports Romania's
convergence with the EU, in particular to increasing the participation of the disadvantage
communities in the knowledge based society and towards implementing the goals of the EU 2020
strategy.

Relevance of design and implementation

The project design is highly relevant and is rated highly satisfactory. The three stage
approach for project components’ activities (access-use-benefits) remains highly relevant for the
country’s development challenges and for achieving the PDO. Firstly, the project provided access
and connectivity through the establishment of LCeNs with access nodes in schools, public
administration, public library and public internet access points (PAPIs) in the selected
communities under Component 1. Secondly, the project provided technical assistance to increase
the skills and services for accelerated use of ICT both at local and national level - under
component 1 and 3. Thirdly, the project supported improvement of the quality of ICT use through
its integration in the education process, use of government e-services and online transactions by
businesses and citizen, while ensuring sustainability of project intervention – under Components
1, 2 and 3.

Components’ activities were logically sequenced and coordinated at central and local level.
The combination of multi-sectoral interventions envisaged by the three components was critical
for achieving the impact on the ground, as evidenced by the project impact assessment (see also
Section 3.2). In addition, the implementation of the project by a centralized PMU within the
MCIS as designed by the project, as opposed to multiple PMUs located in the different line
ministries (an alternative rejected during project preparation) was key for overcoming
coordination challenges derived from the cross sectorial and multi-level (local-central) nature of
intervention.

The availability of EU funding after Romania’s accession into EU in 2007 was used
opportunistically during project implementation and led to adaptive project restructurings
that included reallocations and cancellations. First, the second call under the Grant facility
was cancelled given the parallel financing for same objectives, and project funds were
reallocated; second, in view of the advanced discussions with the EC for securing funds for the
CIS implementation and due to the previous difficulties in getting the necessary budget
allocation, the Bank did not concur with the request of the MPF to extend the closing date by 22
months to complete this activity. The design was appropriately adjusted to reflect what the project
financed. Third, and in the context of the legislative changes that eliminated the local authorities
as intermediaries in the businesses registration process, the utilization of the system developed by
the project was stopped; however the availability and usage of the online registration by the
project target group (individuals and          family association) was ensured following the
implementation at national scale of a special module for online registration dedicated to this


                                                16
target group, based on the knowledge created under the project. The module is part of the overall
online registration system implemented by the NTR with EU funding.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project contributed to accelerating the participation of the targeted 255 (knowledge
disadvantaged communities (208 communes and 47 small cities or 44 % of the total
knowledge disadvantaged communities) in the knowledge-based society and economy in
Romania to a high extent, as demonstrated by the outcome indicators. Specifically, in the
targeted disadvantaged communities, LCeNs evolved into a daily tool for education, business and
public communications with the Government, with increasing private management and financial
self-sustainability. The two outcome indicators measuring the progress towards the PDO have
been met and exceeded, as follows:

Firstly, 43 % of relevant population (age 16-74 years), higher than the target of 40%, is
satisfied with the project results. As demonstrated by the results of the Household survey
implemented in the KEP communities, the probability of project derived benefits is increased
significantly by the value-added services provided by the PAPIs as a central node of the LCeNs,
besides the Schools, Library and Local Public Administration nodes. These value added services
included assistance for accessing on-line services in the interaction with the local and central
Government, e-commerce and marketing assistance to entrepreneurs, employment related
services, health and cultural related services. The CIS e-government service planned under the
project would have increased the availability of e-government services, but its uptake and derived
benefits at the level of population, as reduced time and cost of interaction with the Government,
would not be observable within the project life. Therefore the cancellation of the CIS e-
government service activity under the subcomponent 2.B does not impact the current PDO rating
which relies on actual project achievements.

Secondly, 30 % of the LCeNs operate in a sustainable manner having concluded
partnerships with different other public or private organizations, higher than the targeted
20%. In addition 51% of the communities have projects pending signing. As result of these
partnerships more than EUR 250 million was attracted in the communities, including for the
development of the LCeNs. In addition, the Institutional Survey with the KEP communities’
mayors elected after 2012 provide additional information about the future financial sustainability
of the LCeNs as over 89 % of them consider that LCeNs’ Internet and operational costs will be
covered and PAPI will continue operate.

The project enabled the Borrower to implement the National Strategy for the New
Economy and Implementation of the Information Society, and the European Union
programs related to the information society for all, as proved by the indicators measuring
the reduction of digital divide as the level of access and use and meaningful use of ICT
against the national and European targets. Thus, in terms of access in the targeted
communities, (i) 43% of the relevant population with no access to Internet before the project has
now access to Internet from any public point (of which 38 % of population use PAPI as access
public point), higher than 38% in the control groups (non KEP communities with similar initial
conditions) and (ii) due to project externalities 50.5% of the relevant population with no access
to Internet before the project has now access to Internet from home, higher than 38% in the
control groups (non KEP communities with similar initial conditions). In respect to regularity of
use, (i) 41 % of relevant population uses regularly the Internet (measured as percentage of
population that used every day or almost every day or at least once a week within the last 3
months before the survey), higher than the control group (35%) and almost equal with the


                                               17
national average of 43% and (ii) 12 % of relevant population uses “meaningfully the ICT
(measured as percentage of population that used e-Government services, for obtaining
information from the public authorities websites, for downloading official forms, for sending
filled in forms) higher than 3 percent in control group and 12 % the national average. These
indicators are measured at the level of relevant population, namely 16-74 years. In addition,
nearly all children (3-15 years) in KEP communities have access to ICT either at home or at
schools and other public points and 88% of them ever used a PC and 73 % ever used Internet, as
compared to 63% and 57% respectively in control non-KEP communities. The benefits are even
higher in comparison with control group in terms of regular use of Internet as 73% of children use
ICT in schools (as compared to 47%) and 71% benefit of regular ICT supported classes (as
compared to 38%).

The project contributed to achieving enhanced individual informational capabilities of
people living KEP communities realized through (i) increased availability to ICT equipment and
Internet; (ii) realized functions through increased usage of ICT; (ii) increased meaningful use of
ICT in informational, social, economic, vertical and horizontal communication and cultural areas
(equaling or outperforming national averages and targets - see Annex 5), in line with the National
strategy for information society.

The project also contributed to achieving enhanced social capabilities at community level in
terms of informational, organizational, social and economic development, political
participation and cultural identity (see Annex 5).

The Project Impact chain and linkages between outcomes, outputs and activities, used also
as conceptual framework for project evaluation, are summarized in the figure below (see
also Annex 2). The main Outputs per components are the following:

   The project delivered all the outputs under Component 1 to improve access to and use of ICT
    in the knowledge disadvantaged communities and achieved the component targets to a high
    extent. 229 LCeNs are operating satisfactorily in line with the satisfactory 3-year LCeN
    sustainability plan. The datasheet demonstrates increased integration of ICT in education,
    increased number and diversified LCeNs services and improved digital competencies above
    the targets (see Annexes 2 and 5 and datasheet). The last activity under this component, the
    Extended Technical Assistance for Communities (est. US$4.5 million), was not launched
    given the budget limitations (see Section 1.7). It would have aimed at consolidating the good
    results from the previous project interventions and disseminated the good practices in other
    communities. It did not negatively affect the achievement of the targets. It would have
    supported and exceeded the existing PDO indicators.
   Based on the approved restructuring, the project delivered the agreed outputs under
    Component 2 to develop and promote e-government services and met the revised targets
    (Sections 1.7 and 2.2). Online registration of entrepreneurs and family associations, targeted
    by the project, was implemented nation-wide as a result of the knowledge achieved under the
    project through the addition of a special software module to register these categories of
    businesses targeted by the project. The utilization of the online system developed under the
    project was stopped in 2011 following the adoption of a new legislative framework governing
    the registration of entrepreneurs and family associations that excluded the role of local
    authorities as facilitators in the registration process. Hence, the indicators that measured
    improved efficiency of local authorities as facilitators were dropped as irrelevant for the new
    registration process. The revised design excluded the implementation and deployment of the
    Integrated System for the Issuance of Civil Information (CIS) (est. US15 million) from the



                                                18
    project given the budget limitations. The bid documents prepared under the project are used
    for procuring the system with funding from EU.
   Based on the approved restructuring, the project delivered the outputs under Component 3 to
    establish the e-Portal (e-comunitate) for promotion of e-commerce, business networking and
    community development and attracted cumulative visits above the target (1104995 vs.
    500,000) and provided grants to 41 SMEs (the project cancelled the second call of grants
    because of the availability of EU funding for SMEs to adopt e-business solutions).

In recognition of its achievements the project received medals and awards from prestigious
international and national institutions, such as: Certification of Good Practice at the ?European
Public Sector Awards? (EPSA) within the European Institution of Public Administration
(Brussels 2011), Laureate of Computer World Honors Program (Washington 2011), 1st Prize at

3.3 Efficiency

The efficiency of the project in achieving the original objectives is substantial. The benefits
brought out by the project outweigh the project costs. Besides the surplus generated from the
value beneficiaries place on LCeNs basic and value added services (the project activities that are
difficult to be quantified in monetary terms), the project helped attract additional funding of more
than EUR 250 million in the project communities, increasing the sustainability of the LCeNs. In
addition, the project activities cancelled from loan financing were further financed by EU grants
funding (grant facility for SMEs and CIS implementation) or by the local budgets of the project
communities (salaries of LCeN staff).

The funding and recovery strategy implemented by the LCeNs was in line with the main
features of the “adoption? model? envisaged in the PAD, by which the Government
contribution was to decline over time till its elimination by the end of the project, while
commercial and donor funding sources were to be identified and attracted. The decline of
the project contribution was more accelerated than initially envisaged as a large part of the
LCeNs operating costs (salaries of the LCeNs staff) that was designed to be financed by the loan
for the whole duration of the project, was in fact funded from the local budgets of the targeted
communities (salaries of the LCeN staff). In addition, other funding strategies were implemented
(EU or other donors 15 funded projects, private-public partnerships, fees for business support
services and training) to increase the operating revenues of the LCeNs. The declined loan funding
mechanism implemented by the project and the stress on delivering diversified LCeNs services
helped ensuring the financial break-even and sustainability of LCeNs.

The project extension of 18 months beyond the original closing date made possible the
implementation of additional risk mitigation measures - the intensified technical assistance
to communities and to schools - which increased the impact and the sustainability of the

                                                21
project. In addition, the project externalities are significant in terms of Internet penetration in the
target communities.

The downside in terms of efficiency is related to the delays in the implementation of the
Integrated System for the Issuance of Civil Information (CIS), mostly due to the insufficient
budget allocation in 2011 and 2012, which finally led to the cancellation of the relevant
portion of the loan. However, the activities done under the project help the authorities develop
the bidding documentation for implementing the system with EU grant funding. Thus, the
cancellation of the relevant portion of the loan, as opposed to the decision to extend the project
closure to finalize the implementation of CIS with loan financing, allowed for a least cost
alternative available at present, given the availability of EU grant funding.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating is satisfactory. The project achieved its highly relevant PDO in
accelerating the participation of knowledge disadvantaged communities in the knowledge
based society and economy in Romania to a high extent. The household and Institutional
survey conducted by the World Bank 2012 in the project communities (KEP) shows important
development impact, equaling or exceeding national and rural area averages along most
dimensions of the ICT impact chain.16 Efficiency remains substantial given the benefits brought
out by the project in spite of implementation delays with the CIS system.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project included insightful needs assessments that helped selecting the project
beneficiary communities. The selection of the rural communities was based on a grid that took
into account several indicators, as follows: (i) the level of access to population to internet and
information (telephone and TV); (ii) the knowledge deprivation score 17 (KDP); (iii) the
dimension of the target groups; (iv) local institutions needs in terms of information; and (v)
community participation and sustainability plans. As a result of the selection, the KEP
beneficiaries were communes and small cities displaying the most deprived level both in
economic and knowledge terms. At the outset KEP covered over 1.09 million persons from 255
localities (2002 Census). Due to the general decline of population and the drop out of 26 localities,
KEP coverage at closure diminished to 1.05 million persons in 229 communities.

The project reached all major groups of population, irrespective of gender, age, ethnicity,
and social strata. Although vulnerable groups, such as women, Roma people or elderly were
not explicitly targeted by the project, they benefited as well from the project. The digital use
and regular use divide is present between rural and urban within the KEP area, as well as between
KEP and non-KEP rural communities and are both statistically significant. Non-KEP
communities with similar initial conditions as KEP communities have poorer levels of access and

17
  Knowledge deprivation score represents a factor score of KEDUC index, TV and phone subscriptions at 100
households, distance to the nearest city, share of commuters in active population, share of 65 and more age population;
KEDUC index is a factor score of the community stock of education, share of population of age 10+ with post-
secondary education, share of post compulsory education students in 15-29 age category and post mandatory school
unit in locality.


                                                         22
ICT skills than KEP communities. The use divide is high in KEP area, nevertheless smaller than
in the non-KEP communities. Thus, the regular use of a computer and/or Internet is correlated
with many factors, including age, gender, human capital, employment status, household's
livelihood strategies, and community capitals. In KEP communities the regular use of a computer
is significantly more frequent among: younger people compared with elderly,18 men compared
with women19 as well as Romanian and Hungarian ethnics compared with Roma people.20

A particular case is the digital divide between Roma people and the rest of the population.
KEP has not closed the gap between Roma and the Romanians regarding access to and
usage of ICT, but as result of the project Roma in KEP communities are better off than
Roma in control group communities, which means that they are better than they would be if
KEP would not have been implemented. Roma represent 3.3% of the population covered by KEP
(more precisely, 1.2% of KEP small urban population and 4.9% of KEP rural population),21 which
is about 33 thousands persons.22 Roma adults aged 16 to 74 years have an ICT usage much lower
than the other ethnic groups: (i) only 53% of Roma have ever used a mobile phone compared
with 83% of Romanians; (ii) 26% of Roma have ever used PC compared with 50% of
Romanians; (iii) only 21% of Roma use regularly a PC compared with 43% of Romanians; (iv)
12% of Roma have ever used Internet compared with 47% of Romanians; (v) only 12% of Roma
use regularly Internet compared with 42% of Romanians. The high usage gap between Roma and
the other ethnic groups is strongly associated with a lower access to ICT equipment and
infrastructure. Roma are usually grouped in poor and remote villages (or neighborhoods), hence
they are overrepresented among the population geographically disadvantaged. 23 Most Roma
households are large, with many children and little incomes and many face poverty. Consequently,
they are overrepresented among people who cannot afford equipment and, particularly, the
monthly costs for phone or Internet subscription. Thus, out of the whole Roma population (all
ages): 53% persons live in households with one (or more) mobile phones (versus 86% of
Romanians), 51% Roma persons live in households with access to PC at home (versus 55% of
Romanians), and 25% Roma live in households with access to Internet at home (versus 48%
Romanians).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project has a substantial institutional development impact in the targeted communities.
The design and implementation of the project followed the ICT impact chain approach by
providing access to ICT, use of ICT, and through value added services boosting the meaningful
use of ICT for deriving benefits in various areas of life. The project contributed to enhance the

   In KEP area, the proportion of individuals 16 to 74 years old who use regularly a computer decreases from 76% of
16-29 age category to 49% of 30-39 years, 45% of 40-49 years, 33% of 50-59 years, and only 9% of 60-74 age
category. In non-KEP area, this indicator ranges between 63% of young (16-29 years) and 4% of elderly (60-74 years).
19
   The proportion of individuals 16 to 74 years old who use regularly a computer is: 46% of men compared with 39% of
women, in KEP area; 44% of men and 36% of women, in KEP rural area; 41% of men versus 31% of women, in non-
KEP rural area; 47% of men and 43% of women, at the national level (data Eurostat for 2012).
20
   In KEP area, the proportion of individuals 16 to 74 years old who use regularly a computer is 43% of Romanians or
Hungarians, but only 21% of Roma. However, in the control rural communities virtually no Roma use a PC on a
regular basis.
21
   In 2012, after the project was adjusted, KEP covered 229 local communities with approximately 1.05 million
inhabitants.
22
   KEP Roma population is gender balanced, but is much younger compared with the Romanian population: more than
half (51%) of them are children 0-15 years, while among the Romanian ethnics this age category represents only 14%.

capabilities of individual and communities for social and economic development, local
participation and community empowerment and the capacity of local institutions to provide ICT
related value added services. The most important two benefits, as indicated by the surveyed
population, are "better schools within communities" and "enhanced level of civilization and
openness to world of citizens". In addition, the Ministries involved in the project increased their
capacity to implement large and complex project that require intra-Government coordination and
involve a large number of communities.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

None (the PDO was fairly broad and covered most of the benefits that resulted from the project
although some benefits were not quantified. For example, the project goal was to make LCeNs
sustainable and it measured it in terms of % of LCeNs sustainable, but it did not set any targets
for the amount attracted. The value of partnerships is significant, perhaps more than anticipated
(see Section 3.2), but it can't be said that the outcomes are unintended because these funds will
help LCeNs to continue to provide a daily tool for education, business and public
communications with the Government, as planned)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

According to the beneficiaries interviewed as part of the Household and Institutional
Survey, the project was largely successful, that is most stakeholder groups attained their
major goals and did not experience significant undesirable outcomes24. Actually, the project
has been awarded by prestigious national and international organizations (Section 3.2). Following
the ICT impact chain: the access to information and ICT has been significantly improved; the
basic ICT skills were ensured; the higher Internet proficiency accompanied by guidance and
support provided through PAPI services has resulted in meaningful use of Internet, which led to
enhanced informational capabilities; and thus the project has had a positive impact on well-being,
both at the individual and community level. The multiplier effect of informational capabilities
varies from one area of life to another. Positive impact has been highlighted in the informational,
social and, especially, in the cultural areas. Less extended impact was observed in the economic
(income generating) and vertical communication (eGovernment) areas, however high in relative
terms (compared to the national average), particularly taking into consideration that the impact in
these areas is limited by broader socio-economic factors found out of the scope of the project.

In view of the beneficiaries, the services provided through LCENs (at PAPI) played the
most important role in enhancing people's informational capabilities and in increasing the
odds of meaningful use of Internet in order to derive benefits in the social, economic,
political and cultural areas. PAPIs played the role of an ICT and social intermediary as a rather
successful process of technical and social appropriation took place at the local level. The
prospective for PAPIs future seems optimistic, according to the mayors of the participating
communities. Nonetheless, sustainability remains an issue to be considered.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The sustainability of the project impact is significant at the level of the communities assisted
by the project. 229 communities (or 90%) of an initial number of 255 communities initially
supported by the project, implement measures in line with their approved sustainability plans.
30% of the communities have concluded partnerships and are implementing various development
projects. Moreover, 51% of communities have projects pending signing. About 80% of the
mayors of these communities who were elected in 2012 consider the LCeNs as financially
sustainable after project closure. The interventions made at the school level are currently
anchored in national adopted policies. In addition the local authorities took over the operational
costs of the LCeNs and the cost of equipment renewal, initially envisaged to be financed by the
project.

Despite the optimistic view of the beneficiaries, there is a risk regarding the sustainability of
the LCeNs and in particular of PAPIs which have been so important in driving forward the
program. The risk is however mitigated due to (i) the externalities already created by the project
(Internet penetration and use at house level in the targeted communities), (ii) the availability of
EU funding over the next seven years (2014-2020) allowing communities to further implement
ICT driven projects and implement digital agenda’s objectives and by using PAPI as
intermediaries, and (iii) the knowledge and digital competencies built under the project that are
nor resting only with LCeN staff.

The sustainability of project interventions at central level and knowledge built are also
significant. As described in Section 2.5, (i) the Government implements the CIS nation-wide
using the European Funds and by involving the same core technical team of the MCSI and MAI;
(ii) the online registration of businesses is a core service provided by the National Trade Registry;
(iii) new e-business programs are planned for the next financial programming period 2014-2020,
built on the knowledge created under the project; and (iv) digital competency is recognized as one
of the eight core key competencies at national level and reflected in school curricula, and teaching
and learning standards, while teaching lessons developed under the project are accessible nation-
wide.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank’s performance during preparation is rated satisfactory. The project adequately
responded to the sector and to country’s demands with the objective to help Romania implement
the National Strategy for the New Economy and Information Society as well as EU programs
related to information society for all. The project design included a coherent set of interventions
to tackle market failures in a very near future. The project was designed to introduce the needed
investment, services and TA in a planned phased way and at several points, competitive
mechanisms and alternative management and financing models. The project promoted
institutional building, increase of capacities and coordination among government institutions. The
project was designed to be flexible given the innovative nature of the interventions. It included a
learning process through various pilot activities and use of alternative models for LCeNs.




                                                 25
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank’s performance during implementation is rated satisfactory. The project
supervision was adequate (approximately 12 implementation support missions with an average of
two missions yearly), and provided the necessary close support throughout implementation.
Although the project implementation was very complex and supervision was challenged on many
aspects, the Bank responded proactively and in all fronts, by taking the necessary steps to keep
the project in track. All three restructuring of the projects were conducted with great caution to
address the identified shortcomings or respond to new developments or to new difficulties created
by various factors or to strengthen the sustainability of the project results. Attention was paid to
preserving project’s consistency with PDOs and ensuring compliance without significantly
modifying project outcomes. The team timely revised project risks and introduced risk mitigation
measures to ensure project sustainability. The team focused on monitoring the progress based on
carefully chosen indicators and invested resources above the average in assessing the impact of
the project on the communities and compared to national averages.

The fact that the project had one team leader almost from its start was an important factor that
contributed to the quality of supervision, consistency of documentations, clarity of messages and
efficiency of actions and advice from the Bank’s side. Overall technical quality of the team
members was also high.

Fiduciary aspects of the project were also conducted in a satisfactory manner; procurement was
always assessed satisfactory, despite the technical complexity of the contracts and their size.
Financial management was also satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall the Bank performance is Satisfactory on both ensuring the quality at entry as well as
during supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The borrower’s performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The project was very complex
and among others presented a lot of challenges in terms of coordination amongst implementing
institutions. As evidenced by project supervision documents, there were difficulties in terms of
activating coordination, communication and strategic leadership mechanisms. However, over the
years the coordination among the institutions involved in the project, both at policy and technical
level, improved. Protocols of cooperation were concluded between MCSI and MAI and STS for
implementing the CIS project and between MCSI, MERYS and the Ministry of Culture for the
TA for ICT integration in schools. The frequent changes in the leadership of the involved
Ministries and in particular of the Ministry of Communication and Information Society
influenced negatively the path of project implementation as they delayed decisions and
challenged project ownership. In addition, the inability of the MCSI and MPF to mobilize the
necessary budgetary resources during the last two years made it impossible to complete the two
last project activities and negatively affected achievement of related outputs.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating Satisfactory

The PMU performed well during the entire project life and in spite of the temporary
shortages and of cross sectorial and multi-level coordination challenges, was effective and
instrumental in the implementation of the project. The strong PMU director and staff were of
high professional quality and dedicated to project objectives. The technical assistance was
effectively used and monitoring and evaluation systems were put in place and effectively used.
The PMU regularly monitored and evaluated the project activities including by implementing
questionnaires and case studies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall the Borrower Performance is Moderately Satisfactory. The activity of the Steering
Committee and of the Project Implementation Unit was affected mostly by the factors beyond
their reach as described above, and foremost by the insufficient budget allocation to pre-finance
project activities in 2011 and 2012 which led to delays in implementation and cancellation of loan
funds (2013 restructuring). However, the PMU, and in spite of the temporary shortages and of
cross sectorial and multi-level coordination challenges, was effective and instrumental in the
implementation of the project.

6. Lessons Learned

The staged approach (access-use–benefits), the in-built flexibility to adjust interventions to
specific needs of the communities to increase the uptake of ICT for derived benefits and the
close monitoring and adjusting of indicators as the implementation evolves are critical
success prerequisites for innovative and complex projects like this. The project provided
access and connectivity through the establishment of LCeNs with multiple nodes in schools,
public administration, local libraries and PAPIs; secondly the project provided technical
assistance to increase the basic digital competencies for using computers and Internet; lastly, the
assistance was devoted towards meeting the user needs and perspective, improving the quality of
use and reinforcing the trust and confidence to encourage the use and development of e-
government services and carry out online transactions, while becoming more aware of security
issues. The intensified TA to schools and TA to communities were essential in this respect and
the proper use of monitoring allowed for timely adjustments in project focus at local level. This
last stage was critical for achieving benefits as demonstrated by the results of the Household and
Institutional survey that showed that KEP communities are better off than non-KEP communities
from the control group that had initial similar condition, both in terms of regularity of use, but
more importantly in terms of meaningful use of ICT. Most of the non-KEP communities
benefited from interventions from other Governmental programs or EU funded programs,
however they were fragmented, and limited only to providing access to Internet and at most to
building digital competencies to allow simple use of ICT.

Multi sectorial-interventions are necessary to tackling different communities’ needs
however the project design needs be based on appropriate assessments to allow selectivity to
ensure the balance between project complexity and optimum impact. The project included
insightful needs assessments that helped select beneficiary communities, identify their needs,
design the multipurpose node business model for the LCeNs and define the scope of the technical
assistance needed to respond to the different stakeholders (teachers, students, clerks, businesses,
population at large). Thus the LCeNs’ nodes were selected to be established in schools, Mayor

Office, local library and PAPI as the most critical knowledge access points for the communities.
Technical assistance was tailored to respond to the specific needs of the stakeholders and project
results reconfirmed and reinforced the multipurpose business model for LCeNs.

PAPI role needs to be understood in the evolving community context and supported with
different instruments to be able to address increasingly more sophisticated community
needs. PAPI’s role, as envisaged by the project was of a Broadband universal service25 provider
for the selected communities, but also a catalyst for the uptake of ICT and derived benefits. While
in initial stages of the project implementation PAPI was established and mostly used for
accessing computers and Internet, the increasingly higher internet household penetration
(expected externality) and more sophisticated needs of the beneficiaries, determined PAPIs to
reconsider their role by focusing on providing value added services (business support service
provider - in particular to farmers, knowledge and training center, project management for local
economic development, information and tourism center, etc). The project supported this transition
by first providing the ICT endowment and training of LCeNs staff to ensure the simple of ICT,
and moved towards more customized assistance based on specific local needs (TA for
communities) for supporting PAPIs to provide 26 value added services. As revealed by the
Household survey, more than 70% of the PAPIs beneficiaries declared to be (very) satisfied with
regard to nearly all services provided.

Governance and ownership at local level are critical risk factors for LCeNs’ sustainability,
that are particularly high in crisis periods, and mitigating measures are needed to achieve
sustainable results on the ground. Sustainability of LCeNs was an obsessed concern of both the
PMU and Bank’s team, particularly since the project was to address most of the k-disadvantaged
communities in Romania with a very low base start-up. Mitigating risks measures were
considered from the design phase and additional ones were developed during implementation.
Given the lessons learnt from the pilot stage and the quality of the LCeNs development plans
prepared by the communities as part of the selection process, the project teams stressed on the
need for additional technical assistance to communities for increasing the sustainability of project
interventions. Sustainability plans were thus developed based specific knowledge needs and
corresponding actions identified in consultative processes with targeted beneficiaries. 90% of the
communities initially selected in the project approved the sustainability plans as part of their
Local development plans supported by the local budgets and pursuit with their implementation.
The project activities, outputs and outcomes for the community, generated strong ownership and
resulted in higher counterpart contribution27 than initially envisaged, even during a financial crisis.
The fact that most of the new mayors elected after 2012 in the KEP communities support and
commit to support financially the sustainability of the LCeNs is an additional proof of that.

The project interventions at school level need to be anchored in national policies for
sustainable results and results to be shared nation-wide. The project supported both policy

changes at the national level as well as intervention at school level. In the absence of a Policy for
ICT in Education at the beginning of the project, the interventions at school level were running
the risk to be left as pilot attempts. Much attention was given to assist MERYS to develop and
implement policies and strategies that provided a comprehensive approach to digital competence
development, encompassing national curricula reform that integrate and assess digital
competencies within and across subjects, revising teacher ICT competency standards in terms of
pedagogy practice and professional development, curriculum and assessment, school organization
and development. A multitude of Guides and Books for ICT in Education were prepared and
disseminated with other schools via Internet and in hard copy.

The difficulties in designing and implementing e-government services should not be
underestimated and need to be considered in the broader context of the public
administration reform efforts. While the project had an appropriate design by envisaging ICT
uptake from both the demand side and supply side, the implementation of the nation-wide e-
government services under Component 2 (CIS and online registration of local businesses) posed
not only technical difficulties, but also implied the review of the internal businesses processes of
the organizations involved that required time to address. The use of the ICT was not for
automating existing procedures, but rather to streamline and made more efficient the authorizing
environment. The implementation was much delayed in the case of the CIS due to concerns of
security of information, but also to changes in the legal and institutional framework. Although the
project could not implement the CIS, it built significant knowledge and strengthened the inter-
institutional cooperation. These achievements allow for a now smoother implementation with EU
funds, which otherwise would not have been possible.

The results achieved under the KEP demonstrate the comparative advantage of the Bank in
designing and implementing complex and innovative projects. Although an EU accession
country at the time of the start of the project, Rumania needed a holistic approach in development
of an information society and increasing penetration of ICT even in the most disadvantaged areas
of the country, to be able to integrate and compete within the EU. The Bank was able to deliver a
project that could serve the sustainable achievement of the country’s objectives and even when
there was not possible to complete the activities within the project, it prepared the technical
ground for follow up under EU financing.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower rated the Performance of the Borrower as Highly Satisfactory based on a Highly
Satisfactory rating for the PMU performance and Highly Satisfactory rating for the Government.
However, due to major shortcomings, in particular in terms of ensuring the necessary budget for
the smooth project implementation that further led to the cancellation of two project activities, the
Overall Rating for the Borrower is Moderately satisfactory.

Notes:

Relative to the original allocation per components, the cancellation of US$ 19.6 million reflects
the changed described below.

      1. About US$ 13.3 million of the cancelled amount represents savings generated throughout
         the project life. Thus:

               Part A: Savings of about US$ 5.5 million representing the Operational Costs for the
                functioning of the LCeNs (salaries of the LCeNs staff, LCeNs office supplies, LCeNs
                rent of office accommodations): The operating costs incurred by the LCeNs
                estimated at US$ 8.5 million and planned to be financed entirely from loan proceeds,
                were in reality covered jointly from the project funds and from the local budgets of
                the beneficiary local authorities. The loan financed the internet and telephone costs,
                depreciation, system upgrades and maintenance. The other costs, such as office
                rentals, utilities other than internet and salaries of the LCeNs staff, were taken over
                by the local authorities. This measure followed the lessons learnt from the pilot stage
                reviews to implement measures to increase the local ownership of the project. In
                addition this measure addresses other issues, such as: the consistency of the LCeN
                staff salary and the public pay levels and frameworks; sustainability of project
                interventions; and difficulties in managing a PMU with more than 500 consultants to
                cover the 255 communities. The savings were reallocated among other expenditures

        categories within the component 1 (in the 2010 restructuring) and were planned to be
        used mainly to finance risk mitigation measures identified by mid-term review, such
        as the intensified technical assistance to communities and to schools. These activities
        were to be measured under the originally PDO results indicators. New intermediate
        indicators have been added however to reflect more accurately the activities
        performed.

       Part C: Savings of about US$ 5.8 million from the cancellation of planned calls
        under the Grant facility: Given the availability of EU grant funds for the adoption of
        e-business solutions by firms in an amount of about EUR 151 million, the Project
        Steering Committee decided not to launch the second call under the grant scheme and
        to finance the program from grant sources. The resulting savings were reallocated to
        component 2 and target of the relevant intermediate indicator was reduced from 300
        grants to 41 (RP 2011).

       Part D: the loan allocation was reduced by $1.3 million. This represents the savings
        from the Project Management unit operational costs.

2. About US$ 6.3 million cancelled from Part B (component 2) represents the initial
   allocation for the CIS from Part B of the project. This activity was measured only in
   terms of intermediate results in the original results framework and was captured by the
   existing result indicators. As part of the 2011 restructuring, the size and technical
   solution of this activity was modified and loan proceeds were reallocated to this activity
   in an amount of about US$ 15 million. Two new result indicators and six intermediate
   indicators were added to accurately reflect the change and the impact in the project. The
   development objective did not change as the availability of the e-government service for
   civil status was already assumed as part of the Project Development Objective and the
   scaling up of the system was envisaged by the PAD. The later cancellation of this activity
   of this activity in 2013 involved the reduction of the loan amount and the dropping of the
   result and intermediate indicators introduced in 2011. The CIS e-government service
   planned under the project would have increased the availability of e-government services,
   but its uptake at the level of population and derived benefits would not be observable in
   the project life time-span. Therefore, the cancellation of the CIS e-government service
   activity under Part B does not impact the current PDO rating which relies on actual
   project achievements.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1. Access to ICT in Knowledge Disadvantaged Communities and Improved
Digital Literacy

Rating: Highly satisfactory (Actual costs US$ 38 million)

The objective of this component to provide access to ICT through the provision of physical
equipment and connectivity and to achieve increased benefits for the communities by
leveraging the access to information provided by the Local Community Electronic
Networks (LCeNs) through targeted technical assistance was fully achieved, as shown by the
results presented below, following the project impact chain (access-use-benefits):

The following results contributed to achieving the Improved Access to ICT outcome
through the provision of technical assistance, goods and training:

           The objective of targeting the most K-disadvantaged communities through a
            competitive and transparent selection procedure, built on community ownership
            commitments, was achieved. Thus, the selection of communities was done in two
            competitive phases: (a) Pilot-phase, by which 9 communities were selected through a
            competitive selection encompassing 80 communities; and (b) Scale-up phase, by which
            an additional 246 communities were selected, based on the lessons learnt from the pilot
            stage. As part of the local commitment 510 staff ( 255 LCeN managers and 255 IT
            administrators) were hired by the local communities and financed from local budgets as
            opposed to loan, as initially envisaged by the project.

           The objective to improve the access to ICT of approximately 45% 30 most
            disadvantaged communities in Romania, by establishing at least 20031 LCeNs was
            achieved. Thus, the project established 255 LCeNs in 208 communes and 47 small cities.
            Together they represent about 44% of the most disadvantaged communities in Romania
            and cover a population of about 1.09 million people.

           The objective of implementing a LCeN multi-purpose node business model was
            achieved in all selected communities. Thus, in each of the 255 communities the local
            electronic networks that were establish link the following institutions: (i) the basic and
            lower secondary schools; (ii) the local administration offices (Town Halls); (iii) the
            public libraries; and (iv)the Public Information Access Points (PAPIs). The model was
            adjusted to also respond to the specific needs of the 246 villages and neighborhoods
            belonging to the selected communities, by the addition of a secondary node in the lower
            secondary schools located in those areas. In this respect the project delivered the
            following outputs:

                    255 LCeNs with nodes in: (i) 502 schools; (ii) 255 Town halls; (iii) 255 public
                     libraries and (iv) 255 PAPIs were connected to broadband Internet (more than
                     100 km of fiber optic);

The major outputs were delivered efficiently. The last activity under this component, not
launched given the budget limitations (and planned to be financed from savings), the Extended
Technical Assistance for Communities (est. US$4.5 million), aimed at consolidating the good
results from the previous project interventions and disseminate the good practices in other
communities. Its cancellation did not affect the targets negatively (see Sections 1.6-1.7).

As shown below, all the targets were met with a minor shortcoming in meeting the Level of ICT
integration in schools (Result #3). Additional results for the improved use of ICT in schools are
expected from the ongoing Technical Assistance in schools.

   The impact of the TA in schools is expected to be fulfilled and can be reported at the beginning of the 2013-2014
school year. Currently in all targeted communities the main schools have Institutional Development Plans prepared
with implementation planned to start as of September 2013. In addition, there is a 90% improvement of the baseline
situation.

Firstly, under Subcomponent 2A the project originally has as output that was delivered,
namely the Online system for the registration of individual entrepreneurs and family
associations. However, the utilization of the online system developed under the project (0.8
million) was stopped in 2011 following the adoption of a new legislative framework governing
the registration of entrepreneurs and family associations that excluded the role of local authorities
as facilitators in the registration process. Hence, the registration process supported by the system
developed, as well as the indicators that measured improved efficiency of local authorities as
facilitators were dropped as irrelevant for the newly approved registration process. Furthermore,
the Online registration of entrepreneurs and family associations, targeted by the project, was
implemented nation-wide in 2012 as a result of the knowledge achieved under the project through
the addition of a special software module to register these categories of businesses targeted by the
project. In recognition to the actual output by end project the output indicator was changed (as
part of the Restructuring) to actually reflect the current situation.

Secondly, based on the restructured design, the project delivered two outputs under 2B,
namely (i) the business processes analysis and identification of technical and functional
alternatives for implementation (as result of the TA) ; and (ii) the technical specifications for the
nation-wide application of the system. The implementation of the originally designed output,
namely the implementation of the CIS e-government system was much delayed initially due to
concerns of security of information, and later due changes in technical solutions, changes in the
sequence of implementation, and of institutions involved and foremost by the insufficient budget
allocation to allow the implementation. The project was restructured three times to respond to
changed context and needs: first, the June 2010 restructuring provided a 18 months extension to
allow sufficient time for implementation; second, the August 2011 restructuring allowed for a
nation-wide implementation of the system vs. the gradual scale up as envisaged originally by the
PAD, and the utilization of the state intranet vs. the internet through reallocation of project funds
and changes of the result indicators; and third, by February 2013 when the implementation of the
system was dropped, the respective project funds were cancelled and results framework amended.
Although the project could not implement the CIS, it built significant knowledge and
strengthened the inter-institutional cooperation. These achievements allow for a now smoother
implementation with EU funds, which otherwise would not have been possible.

The component had been rated previously unsatisfactory because of the progress in implementing
e-Government services had been practically stalled since September 2011. The procurement
process for the Integrated System for the Issuance of Civil Information (CIS), estimated to about
US15 million did not start, despite the efforts made to timely restructure the project and to
finalize the bidding documents (the design was restructured in 2011).

   The utilization of the on-line registration system developed with project funds was stopped in 2011 following the
adoption of a new legislative framework governing the registration of local business that excluded local authorities
from the registration process. The National Trade Registry provides the possibility for the local business to register on-
line.
46
   Due to the budgetary constraints the implementation of the CIS with project funds was canceled, in spite of the
readiness of the bidding documents.

First, under Subcomponent 3A the portal was developed (http://www.ecomunitate.ro/business)
and has progressively developed content relevant for the stakeholders in the communities assisted
by the project. The data provided by Google Analytics show that since launching in March 2009
the portal was visited 906,520 unique visitors 1,291,178 times. The portal has sections dedicated
to business, education, public administration, etc. The business section provides a virtual space
for business networking, dedicated to rural entrepreneurs.

Second, under Subcomponent 3B 41 firms implemented e-business solutions under the
Grant facility. The initial target of 300 was revised downwards to 41 projects as part of the 2011
restructuring given the availability of EU grant funding for similar objectives and funds were
reallocated for subcomponent 2B CIS. The total value of the 41 projects implemented is of more
than 6.8 million RON, of which the project finances 4,287,185 RON or the equivalent of
US$1,095,000. All the projects were implemented on time.

Third, the Subcomponent 3.2 financed the Monitoring and evaluation of the Grant Facility
program. Findings and recommendations were used to simplify the EU funded manuals.

                                           Conceptual framework49

The ICT impact chain is modeled as a five-step process on two levels: individual/
household level and collective/ community level. The concept of capabilities is defined at
each level on six dimensions. Individual capabilities relate to informational,
psychological, social, economic, political and cultural areas, while the collective
capabilities refer to informational, organisational, social and economic development,
political participation and cultural identify. Each of these is linked to a set of outcome
indicators that could be measured according to ICT impact.

Realized functionings - Usage of mobile phones, computers and Internet

Access to ICT has significantly improved in the communities covered by the Knowledge
Economy Project (KEP), much more than in the areas were the project was not
implemented. Improved access to ICT tools, such as Internet, represents a potential for
enhancing people's capabilities but does not automatically lead to better and more
diversified livelihoods: 'having Internet access is a necessary, but insufficient, condition
for its use... Actual use of ICT, rather than access to ICT, is a critical precondition for
ICT to have an impact on well-being and the knowledge on how to use the Internet is
more important for poor peoples‘Internet uses, than having access to the technology
within their communities (Gigler, 2009). Attached tables show usage of ICT in KEP and
non-KEP areas.

Enhanced informational and human capabilities - Meaningful use of Internet

This section shifts from use to meaningful use defined in operational terms as regular use
of Internet in the last three months for deriving real benefits in informational, social,
economic, political and cultural (identity) areas. Unlike the simple use of Internet,
meaningful use captures the depth, usefulness and level of expertise in Internet use.

                                                       Informational area

The new ICT capabilities (person‘s ability to use computer hardware, software, and ICT
tools), achieved within the project, help residents of KEP communities in enhancing their
informational capital through accessing Internet for information that can play a
transformative role on existing human and social capabilities and thus can have an impact
on their livelihood and well-being. In KEP area, the Internet use for informational
purposes is as high as the national average. Searching on Internet for information about
goods and services is a behavior more spread than in the control non-KEP (31% in KEP
rural compared with 24% of individuals aged 16-74 years).

Social area

In KEP area, Internet use for communication purposes is as spread as in control non-KEP
communities and very close to the national average. Men and women, from all ethnic
groups and from all types of households, equally use Internet for communicating with
family and friends, but young people use it in a considerable higher proportion than
elderly.50 Ceteris paribus, significantly higher odds of using Internet for communication
purposes have persons who believe that Internet represents the simplest way to keep in
touch with the loved ones left abroad, with higher experience in ICT devices and tools

  91% of Internet users aged 16-29 years compared with 73% of Internet users over 60
years old, both in KEP and non-KEP areas.

and more frequent use of Internet as well as individuals who travelled or worked abroad
for a time or from households with migrants abroad. In this regard, easy access to Internet
is not a significant determinant. The location in non-KEP rural communities (as
compared to KEP communities) significantly increases the odds of using Internet for
communication purposes. An analysis limited to the communities covered by KEP shows
that provision of services of communication online through LCEN (at PAPI) has
positively contributed (but not statistically significant) to the enhancement of the
residents' communication capabilities.51 However, in interviews, the new communication
opportunities created by the project were highly valued, especially in communities with
high rates of temporary migration for work abroad.

The social dimension of well-being covers also education and health, areas in which
improved informational capabilities can play a transformative role in enhancing human
capabilities. With respect to education, the meaningful use of Internet relates to
strengthening of individual agency in terms of raising awareness on the existing
educational opportunities, enabling people to reach higher levels of education, and
providing new opportunities of adult education and vocational training. In this sense, the
KEP has not limited to improving ICT capabilities, but focused on enhancing
informational capabilities by providing through LCEN various training courses (online or
not) highly relevant for livelihood, besides digital literacy training.

we have managed to equip the room with another 16, a Smart table, and a video projector. We

intermediate urbanized area (between 100 and 499 inhabitants/Km²); Rural equivalent with sparsely populated area (less than 100
inhabitants/Km²). n.a. - Data not available. Use of Internet within the last three months before the survey.

Thus, 16% of individuals aged 16 to 74 years from KEP area use Internet for educational
purposes compared with only 10% in non-KEP rural communities, but with 25% national
average. At the level of small cities it is observed a high gap between KEP communities
with only 17% of individuals using Internet for looking for information about education,
training or course offers, compared with 37% at the national level.52

All other things being equal or kept constant, the odds of occurrence of Internet use for
educational purposes are higher in more developed rural communities. The location in
KEP communities does not influence significantly. In addition, an analysis limited to
KEP communities indicates that participants to training programs (either in digital
literacy or in other skills) delivered through LCENs (at PAPI) have a somewhat higher
probability to use Internet for educational purposes, which however is not statistically
significant.53

With regard to health, enhanced informational capabilities are linked to better access to
quality health services and improved health related knowledge. In this respect, in some
communes, the project played through PAPI an intermediation role between community
and providers of medical services (private or public) not available within community.

The proportion of individuals aged 16 to 74 years who use Internet for health related
purposes is similar to the national rural average in KEP rural communities, but much
lower in KEP small cities (16% compared with 36%).
….
Overall, 25-26% of individuals aged 16 to 74 years from KEP communities (rural and
urban) use Internet on a regular basis for educational and/or health related purposes. The
corresponding share in non-KEP rural communities is only 19%. Hence, the propensity of
using Internet for deriving benefits in social area is significantly higher in KEP
communities compared with the other rural communities. Moreover, these Internet users
make a distinctive note among the KEP residents as they assess considerably more
positive the benefits of the project in the social area, in particular in rural communities.
For example, 'KEP contributed to improvement of local school to a large or very large
extent' believe 81% of the Internet users for educational or health related purposes from
KEP rural communities compared with 45% of the other residents (users or non-users).
Or, 'KEP contributed to enhancing access to medical services of better quality' consider
44% of Internet users for educational or health related purposes compared with only 22%
of the other residents of KEP rural communities.

In conclusion, on the social dimension, the project succeeded at a large extent to close the
knowledge gap between the rural disadvantaged communities (at the project outset) and
the non-disadvantaged ones by expanding the informational capabilities of residents. By
contrast, in the small urban communities, the results are good with respect to
enhancement of communication capabilities, but limited regarding education and health
areas. The value-added services provided through LCENs (online communication,
courses and trainings, health services) have contributed in a positive manner to the ICT
multiplier effect on residents' communication and human capabilities, yet still insufficient
for making a statistically observable change. People with higher capitals benefited more
than the disadvantaged groups, but: (a) the disadvantaged groups are somewhat better
than they would have been if the project would not have been implemented (in KEP
compared with non-KEP communities);54 (b) the project has not explicitly targeted the
disadvantaged groups.
                                      Economic area

The KEP focused on capacity-building and provided a variety of employment services
and locally tailored services for businesses and farmers. Nevertheless, the use of Internet
for economic purposes is still very low, but it has almost reached the national averages.


54
   For example, among the Internet users of Roma ethnicity (16-74 years), while in KEP communities one in every two
of them use the Internet for educational or health related purposes, in non-KEP communes the proportion is virtually
zero. Similar, among the Internet users from households in relative poverty, the proportion of those using the Internet
for educational or health related purposes is 52% in KEP communities compared with 32% in non-KEP communes.

Data: KEP Survey: N=1,947 persons present in KEP communities (1,122 rural and 825 small urban) (May 2012) and for the control
non-KEP group N=590. For Romania and EU-27, Eurostat data accessed at March 16th, 2013, where: Small urban equivalent with
intermediate urbanized area (between 100 and 499 inhabitants/Km²); Rural equivalent with sparsely populated area (less than 100
inhabitants/Km²). Data for small urban area at the country level are not available. Use of Internet within the last three months before
the survey.

Using Internet for seeking a job or sending an application depends foremost on the
employment status and, to a smaller extent, on human capital and preferences. Thus
significantly higher odds of using Internet for seeking a job correspond to the
unemployed but also to any employed persons (other than white collar) of active age,
persons who travelled or worked abroad after 2000 (or belong to a household with
migrants for work abroad), particularly Romanians,55 as well as to people with medium
or advanced Internet skills, and to individuals who believe that computer knowledge is
vital for finding/ keeping a job. The location in KEP area is not a significant predictor.
However, within the KEP area, the participation in active labor market services delivered
through LCENs (at PAPI) increases significantly the odds of using Internet for seeking a
job.56

Selling goods and services over the Internet has significantly higher odds to occur among
employers and non-agricultural self-employers,57 particularly Romanians (as compared to
other ethnic groups),58 people with more advanced Internet skills, from households with
more diversified livelihoods (remittances, incomes from agriculture) and a rather solid

   In rural areas (KEP or non-KEP), virtually no Roma use Internet for seeking a job, even if they are regular Internet
users.

56
   Tested on the basis of the model showed in table A.17 to which we added a dummy variable regarding participation
at local PAPI in active labor market services (information on the available jobs, job fairs, assistance in job searching
and in cv editing etc.), applied only for Internet users from KEP area (N=841). This model adequately fits the data and
Nagelkerke R2=0.30. Participation in the relevant PAPI services obtains: Exp(B)=4.01 at Sig.=0.000.

57
  In KEP as well as in the non-KEP areas, farmers do not use Internet for selling their products even if they use
Internet regularly. This is most probably the result of the fact that people who self-declare farmers focus on subsistence
agriculture with no plans, strategies or willingness to sell the surplus, which is most often shared with the family
members moved to cities.

58
  Both in rural and urban areas, KEP or non-KEP, virtually no Roma use Internet for
selling goods and services, even if they are regular Internet users.

economic situation (accumulated wealth).59 Ceteris paribus, individuals from KEP area
have considerable lower odds to use Internet for selling goods or services as compared to
people from the non-KEP area. Nonetheless, within KEP communities (rural and urban),
the marketing services for local products (including traditions and tourism) have made a
difference by increasing significantly the odds of Internet use for this purpose.60

'We have initiated another small project, which links local culture and traditions with business.
Thus, we promote our traditional trades - weaving of rushes. On the one hand, we set at PAPI an
online shop for helping our folk craftsmen, but also to <sell> Luncavita's image. On the other
hand, the folk craftsmen started to deliver courses at the local school, in order to revive traditions
among commune's children and young. [...] Also, in our commune we have a large community of
beekeepers (self-employed), more than one hundred people. Through LCEN we helped, so now,
all of them applied for smaller or larger programmes in their field.' (Mayor, Luncaviţa commune,
Tulcea, June 2013)

'We make all kinds of canned fruits and vegetables. We prefer direct selling, by far, but the
distance to the city made everything very complicated before the project. So, as soon as Internet
became available, we set, with real success I would say, an online shop. Other thing, we are in a
village, so we don't have a bank. Here, also, the Internet solved the problem, now we have
Internet banking. Hence, the LCEN has been essential for our business and our lives.' (Local
entrepreneur in Saschiz commune, Mureş, June 2013)

Internet banking has considerably higher odds at the level of employers and non-
agricultural self-employed with better skills and more frequent use of Internet,
particularly Romanians (as compared to other ethnic groups), 61 for people from
households with accumulated wealth as well as for the residents of better developed
communes (as compared with residents of small cities or poor communes). The analysis
on KEP area shows that the online banking services provided through LCENs have
played a significant role in this area.62

E-commerce is also a rare behavior in the entire country and not only in KEP area. E-
commerce is more frequent among better-off people, Romanians, persons who travelled/
worked abroad after 2000 (or have migrants abroad within household), employed,


59
   For example, in rural areas (KEP as well as non-KEP), out of the Internet users (16-74 years) from poor households
less than 3% use Internet for selling goods or services compared with 14% in non-poor households.

  According to the KEP survey, virtually no Roma use Internet banking. The same situation is recorded for farmers
and people from poor households.

unemployed and students (as compared to pensioners and economically inactive people),
with better and deeper knowledge in Internet, from households without children, located
in rural communities. The KEP shows that the existence within community of assistance
services regarding e-commerce and of support services for farmers regarding agricultural
machinery and equipments at competitive prices increases significantly the odds of
Internet use for e-commerce purposes.63

In total, 17-19% of individuals aged 16 to 74 years from KEP communities (rural and
urban) use the Internet on a regular basis for deriving benefits in economic area. Higher
likelihood to use Internet in such a manner have entrepreneurs and non-agricultural self-
employed as well as people who travelled abroad (or from households of migrants for
work abroad), with advanced Internet skills.

The Internet use for economic purposes is still at a low level and so the multiplier effect
on KEP residents' economic well-being is limited. As Gigler (2011) emphasized, due to
the lack of competitive and transparent markets in many rural areas, ICT programs often
fail to improve the negotiating power of small-scale farmers in local and regional
markets, to significantly reduce the high transaction costs or to have any significant
positive impact on their income. This appears to be also the case of the KEP: older
farmers (who predominate) tend to limit to subsistence agriculture, while younger
farmers seek a job in a non-agricultural sector, within the country or abroad. So, farmers
from KEP communities have low likelihood to use Internet for economic purposes other
than job seeking, even when have basic skills and access to technology.

Data: KEP Survey (May 2012). Notes: In each household a single person (randomly selected) responded to
these questions and only 873 out of the 985 respondents are aged 16 to 74 years. Use of Internet within the
last three months before the survey.

Nevertheless, KEP played a significant role in enhancing meaningful use of Internet
through the provision of services targeted mainly to businesses and non-agricultural self-
employed. Table 7 provides additional evidence that individuals using Internet for
improving their livelihood strategies assess the project benefits in economic area in much
more positive terms than the other KEP residents.
                         Political area - Vertical communication

A previous section has already shown that KEP succeeded to strengthen the participants'
communication capabilities, which has resulted in enhancement of horizontal
communication with family members, friends and social networks from other
communities. This section refers to the vertical communication between KEP residents
and the local and central authorities. In this sense, ICTs frequently only play a limited
role in enhancing the transparency of government institutions due to the lack of the
required cultural and organizational change within government institutions themselves.
While ICTs can act to some degree as a catalyst for enhanced governance, a fundamental
change of behaviours and attitudes by politicians and government officials alike is
necessary to enhance the accountability and transparency of government institutions.
Central to the issue of good governance is the lack of <information accessibility> and not
the lack of access to ICTs' (Gigler, 2011, p. 20).

Some KEP communities have made significant efforts in improving information
accessibility and have developed local e-government services. However, such initiatives
of good governance have depended to a large extent on the local authorities' attitude
towards communication and ICT. Hence, the use of e-government services has
significantly increased during the project, but it is highly unevenly distributed among
communities depending on the availability of such services.

 'The citizens, all of them farmers, locals, young and old, have been able to make applications for
 farming subsidies at the Public Information Access Point (PAPI). Citizens have learned what it’s
 about: they come and find out that a measure has been passed in agriculture, tourism, or
 whatever. And they come and apply. A company obtained funding of two and a half million Euros
 for a project, and most of the application was done via Knowledge Economy. Now they’re
 building silos.' (Mayor, Luncaviţa commune, Tulcea, June 2013)

 'The biggest success of the PAPI centre is that it allows access to the national tax payments site.
 Any citizen from Luncaviţa can pay his local taxes from wherever he is in the world. So,
 Luncavita is ahead of many large cities from the country, even ahead of some sectors of
 Bucharest.' (PAPI Manager, Luncaviţa commune, Tulcea, June 2013)

 'Here we have an InfoTouch for people from the village, where they can keep a track of
 information concerning their properties (land and house). They can find their file in our archive
 and access documents such as building permits, certificates, property deeds, applications…'
 (PAPI Manager, Prundeni commune, Vâlcea, June 2013)

 'Everybody has benefitted of PAPI and that’s a very good thing, when it comes to the annual land
 register documents (for farming subsidies), which otherwise cost a lot and use up a lot of time to
 reach the city offices. Now we can do it here and PAPI people help us in using the Internet …'
 (Farmer, Saschiz commune, Mureş, June 2013)

 'Another benefit for the whole community is effective communication. [...] We use the Internet, the
 official webpage of Saschiz village, for example, to post editions of the local newspaper, to post
 news and announcements about what is happening in the community, to inform citizens about the
 Local Council decisions. Everything takes place in a transparent way.' (Mayor and PAPI
 Manager, Saschiz commune, Mureş, June 2013)

 Overall, the use of Internet for interacting with authorities is four times higher in KEP
 area compared with the non-KEP communities, yet lower than the 2012 national
 average.64

    Figure 17 shows that the national average of the use of e-government services jumped
 from 7% in 2011 to 31% in 2012. At a meeting held by the World Bank, officials from
 various ministries provided a series of possible explanations such as the online services
 for Bacalaureat (available before 2011) or those related to the European subventions for
 farmers. However, there is no clear evidence or studies to grasp this substantial growth.



                                                                            62
Data: KEP Survey: N=1,947 persons present in KEP communities (1,122 rural and 825 small urban) (May 2012) and for the control
non-KEP group N=590. For Romania and EU-27, Eurostat data accessed at March 16th, 2013, where: Small urban equivalent with
intermediate urbanized area (between 100 and 499 inhabitants/Km²); Rural equivalent with sparsely populated area (less than 100
inhabitants/Km²). Use of Internet within the last twelve months before the survey.

In the control non-KEP group, virtually no farmer, unskilled worker, unemployed,
individual with no or low formal education, Roma or person from poor households used
e-government services during the last year, even if he or she are regular users of Internet.
By contrast, within KEP communities, the participation of these disadvantaged groups
into communication with authorities via Internet exist, although it is lower compared with
the better-off social groups.65

Ceteris paribus, higher odds to use e-government services have the better educated
people, white collars, grey collars, employers and non-agricultural self-employed,
particularly from rural communities (as compared to small cities). However, the most
influent predictor is individual's preference for online rather than face to face interaction
with public administration and public services. The location in KEP communities
increases significantly the odds of using Internet for communicating with authorities
either for downloading information and official forms or for sending filled forms. Thus,
the project has been successful in strengthening the communication capabilities of
participants both regarding the horizontal and the vertical dimensions.

The project demonstrates that besides expanding the available e-governance services, the
existence within community of support services for filling in official forms and especially
of assistance services for entrepreneurs (information regarding available financing
sources, assistance for elaboration of projects to be submitted to various donors,
European in particular, and assistance for labor force recruitment) increases significantly
the odds of using the e-government services via Internet.66

These results are even more valuable considering that the dominant perception in
Romania is that the public institutions are inefficient and corrupt, which seriously
undermines empowerment (human agency). Actually, among the individuals who use e-
government services prevail the positive opinions according which the project
contributed 'to a large or very large extent' to the improvement of communication
between citizens and authorities, of the knowledge about local authorities' actions, as well


65
  In KEP area, for example, the proportion of Internet users aged 16 to 74 years that in
the last 12 months used one or more e-government services varies from 9% of Internet
users with primary education at most to 48% of University graduates.
66
  Tested on the basis of the model showed in table A.18 to which we added two dummy
variable regarding (1) participation in support services related to e-government and (2)
participation in assistance services for entrepreneurs provided through LCENs, applied
only for Internet users from KEP area (N=859). This model adequately fits the data and
Nagelkerke R2=0.71. Participation in the relevant PAPI services obtains: (1)

as to the enhancement of both access and quality of public services delivered by
mayoralty.
                             Cultural (identity) area

In the cultural area, KEP provided through LCENs (at PAPI) assistance services for web
pages. Additionally, it offered support for all communities willing to create their own
website and in the same time it created the portal www.ecomunitate which has posted
material about each of the 255 covered communities. As a result, many KEP
communities created their own website and have developed a series of cultural activities
(see chapter 4.2.1 section on cultural identity). These activities carried out at the
community level have reflected to the level of individuals. Thus, the Internet use for
cultural purposes in KEP rural communities is significantly higher than in non-KEP area,
but also above the national average. In small cities, the results are close to the national
average.

Data: KEP Survey: N=1,947 persons present in KEP communities (1,122 rural and 825 small urban) (May 2012) and for the control
non-KEP group N=590. For Romania and EU-27, Eurostat data accessed at March 16th, 2013, where: Small urban equivalent with
intermediate urbanized area (between 100 and 499 inhabitants/Km²); Rural equivalent with sparsely populated area (less than 100
inhabitants/Km²). Use of Internet within the last three months before the survey.

Higher odds of using Internet for uploading self-created content to any website to be
shared correspond to younger people, particularly pupils and students, with higher
education, from better-off households, individuals with medium or advanced Internet
skills, who use frequently Internet, from more developed rural communities. The location
in KEP area is not a significant determinant. Nevetheless, the analysis on KEP
communities shows clearly that participation in the assistance services for web pages
provided through LCENs (at PAPI) plays a significant role in increasing the odds of
using Internet for cultural purposes.67

                              Meaningful use of Internet and social structure

The previous sections has examined whether the KEP succeeded in enhancing all four
components 68 of informational capabilities and to what extent and under which
conditions the advanced informational capabilities improved people‘s human and social
capabilities as well as in which area the meaningful use of ICT has indeed played a
significant role. We have seen that the services provided within the project through
LCENs (at PAPI) has played a significant role in increasing odds of meaningful use of
Internet in the social, economic, political and cultural areas.

Taking into consideration the area of meaningful use, the population may be grouped in
four significantly different types: (1) non-users of Internet; (2) users of Internet only for
leisure purposes or not regular; (3) regular use of Internet only for informational and/or
horizontal communication purposes (including leisure activities); (4) regular use of
Internet for other meaningful purposes in order to derive benefits in social, economic,
political or cultural areas (including leisure, informational and/or horizontal
communication purposes). The distribution of population across these four types shows
that, in KEP area, the meaningful use is more extended than in the non-KEP
communities. Furthermore, while within the non-KEP communities predominate
individuals using Internet only for informational and communication purposes, in KEP
communities, the meaningful use tends to cover more areas of life.

Data: KEP Survey: N=1,947 persons present in KEP communities (1,122 rural and 825 small urban) (May 2012) and for the control
non-KEP group N=590. Use of Internet within the last three months before the survey.


Four types of Internet use reproduce at a large extent the existing social inequalities,
covering the social structure from the underprivileged to the most privileged strata. At
one extreme, the disadvantaged groups of population - over 50 years old, women, people
with no or low formal education, farmers and economically inactive people, poor,
geographically disadvantaged households, peripheral communities, underdeveloped


68
  (i) ICT capability (a person‘s ability to make efficient use of computer hardware, software, and ICT tools); (ii)
information literacy (a person‘s ability to collect, process, evaluate, use and share information with others within
her/his own socio-cultural context); (iii) communication capabilities and (iv) content capabilities.




                                                               65
communes - tend to concentrate among people who have never used the Internet. At the
other extreme, the younger people (16-39 years), men and upper social strata have
significantly higher likelihood to use the Internet in a meaningful way for deriving
benefits in various areas. The better-off used their human, economic, social and symbolic
capitals for enhancing their informational capabilities, which in turn have had a multiplier
effect on the initial capitals, whereas the worst-off have been able to extract only lower
benefits for improving their fragile well-being. Nonetheless, the comparison between
KEP and non-KEP area (presented in the previous sections) indicates that the
disadvantaged groups, in particular the poor, Roma and the low educated people, would
have been worse if the project would not have been implemented.

Meaningful use of Internet for other purposes than information and/or communication is
basically an effect of human capital, Internet access and Internet skills. Ceteris paribus,
higher odds of meaningful use of Internet have the unemployed, white collars, employers,
non-agricultural self-employed, pupils and students, grey collars, as well as people who
travelled or worked abroad after 2000, with medium or advanced Internet skills, using
Internet more frequently, in particular from rural communities. In addition, the location in
KEP area increases significantly the odds of meaningful use, specifically due to the
services delivered through the LCENs, at PAPI.69

Better access to information and enhanced informational capabilities can enable people to
make choices in their lives in various areas and so it contributes to their empowerment.
Gigler (2011, p. 19) showed that the enhanced proficiency to use ICT have significant
and direct positive impact on people‘s psychological well-being - individual agency and
self-esteem, particularly for people who belong to the most vulnerable groups, such as
women and youth. Our qualitative data fully confirm this result. Furthermore, KEP
survey shows that participants to the project perceive as benefits of KEP: a sense of
participation in modern world, a better public image of their community as well as an
improved propensity to community participation. In this sense, among the KEP residents,
the most positive assessments come from individuals who use Internet in a meaningful
way for deriving benefits in various areas of life.

stakeholders' perceptions. In this respect, the KEP survey collected opinions from
population, but also from mayors and PAPI managers, regarding the benefits for the
community.

About a half (53%) of the population aged 16 years or more from KEP area have heard
about the project running in their community, with a large discrepancy between
communes (60%) and small cities (only 44%). Most of those who have some information
about the project tend to assess that the project has brought 'medium', 'large' or 'very
large' benefits for their communities.

Data: KEP Survey (May 2012). N=985 persons (554 rural and 431 small urban). The difference between pies is significant. The
difference between bars is not.


From the population point of view, the most frequently mentioned benefits of the project
refer to improved local schools, enhanced level of civilisation and openness to the world,
as well as a better public image of the community, both in rural and urban communities.
Individuals using Internet in a meaningful way tend to assess the KEP benefits in
significantly more positive terms.

According to the mayors and PAPI managers, the project has had considerable benefits
related both to the population empowerment and the capacity of local institutions. Thus,
more than 60% of mayors and PAPI managers declare as 'large' or 'very large' benefits of
the project: improved local schools, enhanced capacity of local authorities to attract
funding, improved quality of services provided by mayoralty, better public image of the
community, enhanced access to information of local institutions and businesses on
funding opportunities, and improved level of civilization and openness to the world of the
citizens.

In most communities, KEP benefits are considered (very) high by all local stakeholders.
In about a quarter of communities, the institutional representatives assess KEP much
positively than the general population, in agreement with the users of Internet in a
meaningful manner. These communities are small cities.




                                                                             67
                                              Informational area

The dominant informational pattern in Romania, both in rural and urban area, is to inform
from mass media, more precisely from the television. The traditional way of obtaining
information through social networks is still present, but it represents the main source of
information for less than 3% of the population even in the rural areas of the country. In
the last years, however, the increase in Internet proficiency has determined a change of
this pattern, more and more people completing the information from television by using
the Internet or even changing the main source of information from television to the
Internet. This process is highly visible in the KEP area. While the non-users of Internet
rely solely on mass media or social networks, more than half of the individuals using
Internet for deriving benefits in various areas declare the Internet as their main source of
information and/or their main source of learning new things.

In parallel, a significant change in attitudes towards the Internet has been developing.
People who have never used the Internet share a dominant opinion rather negative:
'Internet is not for people like me', hence 'learning to use a PC is a waste of time', even
more so given that problems with public institutions can be solved only through
interactions face to face and 'children who use a PC ruin their eyes and become
uncontrollable'. On the contrary, most individuals using Internet in a meaningful way
believe that: 'without knowing to use a computer one has no chance today' as 'via Internet
is much easier to keep in touch with the loved ones working abroad' and the 'new ICT
technologies can improve access to public services for people like me'.

The information flows within KEP communities has improved mainly due to the PAPI
nodes of LCENs as these provided guidance and support for population not only to access
information, but also to understand, to interpret and to use it in a beneficial way. The
communication with community members left for work abroad has been significantly
eased, the interaction between citizens and local authorities has been strengthened, and
the general level of information regarding governmental programs and policies has
increased. This evolution is better perceived and more valued in the rural communities.

                                             Organizational area

By design, KEP involved a rather high participation of communities, community leaders
and institutions, since the preparation phase. The ICT infrastructure was implemented in
collaboration with the local authorities and supposed a community contribution. 70
Capacity building of the local institutions was fostered during all phases of the projects,
not only with equipments and financing, but with trainings of the local staff in various




70
  The local communities that applied for KEP had to participate with a contribution including: (a) spaces for LCEN,
(b) cover the operational and maintenance costs of LCEN as well as (c) the wages of LCEN staff (IT manager and
PAPI manager).




                                                         68
areas (besides ICT) as well as continuous support and guidance during the process.71 The
project had central and unified standards, but a flexible structure which allowed the
participating communities to develop services adjusted to the local context and needs.
Specifically for these reasons, the local stakeholders consider that KEP led to an increase
of both efficiency and transparency of the local organizations (to a smaller or larger
extent, from a community to another). In rural communities the assessments in this regard
are considerably more positive compared with the small cities.

Within KEP, local institutions expanded their capabilities to communicate and exchange
knowledge with other organizations in different communities. Firstly, KEP communities
formed a network which periodically changed informations among them, in particular at
the PAPI level (based on the portal www.ecomunitate.ro). Secondly, the community-
based organizations (formal or informal associations or NGOs) could strengthen their
capabilities. For instance, in some communities, the PAPI provided assistance to informal
community-based organizations to formalize so that to become eligible for funding
applications. Finally, through a series of community development activities, the schools
and public libraries received support in building partnerships with organizations from
other communities. The monitoring reports of the project (Kantor, 2012) show that the
number of joint initiatives, joint projects or partnerships, after significantly increased in
the first years of the project, it has a slightly downward trend in 2011-2012. Nevertheless,
in nearly all KEP communities at least a project was developed in cooperation by the
local organizations (in particular, by the LCENs nodes - PAPI, Town Hall, school and
public library) or in collaboration with LCENs nodes from other KEP communities, and
in about three quarters of KEP communities, partnerships with different non-KEP
communities (inter-school, inter-library etc.) are also functional.

'Our local network has four functioning points: the Public Information Access Point - PAPI, the
Local Administration, the Library, and the School. It works like that: the library holds digital
information, the school uses the library database, we utilise the capacities from the school, and
the PAPI centre is nothing less than the brain of this community.' (PAPI Manager, Luncaviţa
commune, Tulcea, June 2013)

'I can tell you, we are champions in attracting European funds and so there are very many
mayors from all around Romania who come to visit me or call me because they’ve read or heard
about the KEP, and I always have an advice for them. Many times I’ve even helped them draft
their funding applications.' (Mayor, Prundeni commune, Vâlcea, June 2013)




71
  At the central level, it was established a Community Support Center, call-center which provided technical assistance
and support for the whole KEP network. In the same time, a team of community facilitators provided assistance
services. A programme of technical assistance for schools was also made available.

                                                 Social development

The main outcome indicators related to the social development dimension refer to
(according Gigler, 2004) the access and the quality of basic social services, in particular
in education and health as well as the access to social programs of the government. The
previous sections have already shown that KEP has had a positive impact on all these
dimensions, especially through the services provided at PAPIs.

Within the project, a large number of training courses (e-learning or not) in various skills
(not only in ICT) were provided to communities, both for the adult population and for the
institutional representatives. Many of these courses were carried out in cooperation with
foundations and NGOs from other communities. Also, PAPIs have delivered health
related services, which have significantly contributed to improved knowledge about
health practices, but also have increased access to better quality health services (using
Internet), in their beneficiaries' opinion. In addition, within KEP, the access to e-
government services have significantly increased and the knowledge about the
governmental programs and policies have improved among local people. Nevertheless,
with respect to the access of the poor to social government programs, the results are very
limited as the available e-government services in this area are still insufficiently
developed (some selective information and/or forms on a site, at most) for improving the
efficiency, transparency and reach of these programs.

However, from the local stakeholders' point of view, improved local schools represent the
most significant benefit of the community from the project. The importance of educating
the young in the use of ICT is well recognized today. The European Commission
included the use of ICT in Education in the Digital Agenda for Europe (action area:
enhancing digital literacy, skills and inclusion) and proposed a number of actions aimed
to improve the educational outcomes.72

KEP included services as well as ICT equipment provision for the schools which are
LCEN nodes. The services provided within the project consisted of: certified courses for
using ICT for teachers and librarians; actions for the integration of ICT in education;73 e-
vacanta competition;74 technical assistance for use of ICT in schools (aimed at promoting


72
  To increase digital literacy, to mainstream eLearning in national policies, to contribute to the professional
development of teachers and trainers, and to support the students to make the best use of ICT within education.

73
  The objectives in education took into account three dimensions: curricular (innovation in school programs),
pedagogical (innovation in the learning process) and organizational (structural innovation, roles and functions
accomplished by the people involved in education). The development of public policies for ICT integration in the pre-
universitary education system was the first goal that was achieved through a joint-work between the MCSI and
Ministry of Education. http://www.mcsi.ro/Minister/Despre-MCSI/Unitatea-de-Politici-Publice/Documente-de-politici-
publice/formular_pp_TIC.

74
  The e-Holiday! (e-vacanta) competition aimed at strengthening the positive practices in extracurricular educational
activities and at attracting new users in rural areas (parents, grandparents, entrepreneurs, local citizens). In the period
2006-2012, seven editions of e-Holiday! were developed. For more details see http://ecomunitate.ro/evacanta.




                                                             70
the usage of technical and digital content resources in the learning process, but also in
community development activities by attracting funds and building inter-school
partnerships).
As a result, the schools from KEP area score well regarding the ICT infrastructure,
connectivity, teachers’ specialization in ICT and access of students to the ICT
equipments. The comparison with the non-KEP area shows a more nuanced picture. For
this comparison, we developed a typology in line with a recent European study on ICT in
education,75 which focuses not only on access to technology or simple use of ICT, but on
the instruments and methods for enhancing the children's informational capabilities so
that to make the best use of ICT within education. Thus, schools are classified into three
e-types according to 14 criteria as follows:

           An e-equipped school is a school that meets all the following criteria: (1) the
            school has maximum 15 students per computer; (2) more than 90% of the
            computers are connected to Internet; (3) the school has an online presence (i.e.
            web page); (4) the school has technical support (hardware and software).
           An ICT-oriented school is a school with ICT policies that meets at least four of
            the following six criteria: (1) the school has a development strategy based on ICT;
            (2) the school has regulation regarding the responsible use of Internet; (3) the
            school has regulation regarding the plagiarism; (4) the school has regulation
            regarding the use of social media in teaching-learning purposes; (5) the school
            uses filters to prevent access to undesirable content; (6) the school organized
            courses regarding the identification and evaluation of online information.
           An ICT-supportive school is a school that meets at least three of the following
            criteria: (1) all computers used by students are connected to Internet; (2) the
            school equipments are frequently used as teaching support; (3) the school
            equipments are frequently used for informatics lessons; (4) the students have
            access to the computers both during lessons and after the school program.

Based on the above typology becomes apparent the highly positive impact of KEP at the
level of local schools. Thus, in the KEP area, 18% of students go to an e-equipped school,
35% of students are taught in an ICT-oriented school and 39% benefit of an ICT-
supportive school. The gap between the KEP schools and the non-KEP schools is
considerable, especially with regard to orientation towards ICT policies and the support
provided to students. In the control non-KEP communities only 10% of students go to an
e-equipped school, virtually no student is protected within the school by specific ICT
related policies, and only 22% learn in an ICT-supportive school.

Data: KEP Survey (January 2013). Schools: N = 85 for KEP rural and N = 20 for control non-KEP rural; Students: N = 25,705 for
KEP rural and N = 6,801 for control non-KEP rural. The e-typology is based on 14 criteria.


The project brought substantial benefits for the children enrolled in education, both in
access and in use of ICT. The main source for the children from rural KEP area to learn
to use ICT is the school. As demonstrated in a previous section, the access to computers
and Internet in schools is the most efficient way to reduce the use divide between
children from urban and rural areas, children from households with access at home and
those geographically disadvantaged, Roma and children from other ethnic groups, poor
and better-off children. The project has not succeeded to close the gap between Roma and
Romanians regarding access to and usage of ICT, but Roma children are better than they
would be if KEP would not have been implemented. However, for the children from the
disadvantaged groups, such as Roma ethnics or poor families, the access and use of
computers and Internet at school can lead to improvements of their life chances.

Furthermore, the school-community relation has improved as result of the project
activities. Participation of both pupils and teachers in extra-curricular activities increased
in KEP localities during the years of the program implementation. In 2012, almost 43,000
pupils and almost 3,800 teachers were involved in 1,926 organized events (KANTOR,
2012). The participation of such events contributes to the development of the cultural life
and involvement of more inhabitants, which is a characteristic of community
development.

'Local people were reluctant at first, in the first few months. Luckily, young people are
more attuned to the Internet, and it is via them that we managed to introduce it to the old
folks.' (Mayor, Luncaviţa commune, Tulcea, June 2013)

'The KEP began in 2008. From the outset it has been a success thanks to the e-holiday
project, during the summer holiday. All the children from the local school took part.
There were activities in which parents took part also, and we introduced them to IT.


                                                            72
Members of the local community also took part. [...] We took part in a twinning project
with a school from Belgium, in Marche en Famenne. Our children met theirs; they took
photographs and then posted them on a blog. Via technology they also practiced their
French, because they had to communicate.' (Teacher and School Director, Teiu
commune, Dâmboviţa, June 2013)

                                          Economic development

With respect to the economic development, KEP succeeded to empower communities to
access new opportunities. Increased Internet use and proficiency have resulted in
enhanced access to remittances by improving the communication with community
members left abroad for work. The active labor market services, the marketing services
for local products (including traditions and tourism), the online banking services, the
assistance services regarding e-commerce, the support services for farmers regarding
agricultural machinery and equipments at competitive prices have all contributed to
enhancing meaningful use of Internet, which has improved significantly the access to
information and knowledge with a real potential to improve the productive activities of
the community.

The services targeted to businesses and non-agricultural self-employed (information
about funding opportunities and assistance in drafting applications) have contributed to
the development of the local businesses, but also to the significant enhancement of the
use of e-government services…For improving access to financial resources, KEP
included a grants scheme (e-growth), 76 which had limited effects: due to the
underdeveloped local businesses from KEP area, the number of application was so
limited that the scope of the scheme was extended to authorized individuals, family
associations and micro-companies from all over the country.

Access to markets and commercialization of products has not been significantly
improved, particularly for farmers, as it is limited by much broader socio-economic
factors which cannot be tackled by the project. Nonetheless, within the project a large
number of information events and business-related events were organized at PAPIs.77

According to the mayors and PAPI managers, enhanced capacity to mobilize resources
from outside donors is another important outcome of the project, not so much in relation
to entrepreneurs, but in relation to the local authorities. In most KEP communities, the
local authorities together with PAPI, and with the project assistance, have applied for


76
  The e-growth grants scheme was launched in 2009 through an extended awareness campaign.
77
  For example in 2012, 146 communities (out of 229) reported information events with more than 6,400 participants
(entrepreneurs and farmers) on the following topics: National Rural Development Program (PNDR), EU funds and
programs, source of financing for agriculture, tourism and SME’s, Measure 141 from National Rural Development
Program (PNDR) - Support for semi-subsistence farms, Meeting with Agency for Payments and Intervention in
Agriculture (APIA) – informations about APIA subsidies and identification of land areas, Measure 112 from National
Rural Development Program (PNDR) - Setting up young farmers, E-Antreprenor, Measure 121 from National Rural
Development Program (PNDR) - Modernization of agricultural exploitations, Meeting with the County Office for
Employment (AJOFM) and presentation of the EU programme for Human Resources Development (POSDRU),
“Green House? Program, others. (KANTOR, 2012, p. 55)

projects funded from various sources, in particular for the creation or improvement of the
local infrastructure (public buildings, roads, water supply, gas supply, etc.). These funds
represent in many KEP communities the key source for financing economic, social and
cultural activities, hence for community development.

Source: KANTOR (2012, p. 72). One community may have one up to more than 20 projects. 62 communities (out of 229) have no
project or no answer to their applications. In 2012 the total number of projects was smaller than in the previous years because there
were less calls for proposals for EU-funded grants in most operational programmes targeting rural communities and local authorities,
therefore there were less opportunities for project development compared with the period 2008-2010.


'We have focussed attention on one thing: European projects. We have applied for 19 projects
worth 38 million Euros. An integrated project with five parts: drains, extending the water mains,
road surfacing, an after-school project, and conserving and promoting cultural heritage.' (PAPI
Manager, Prundeni commune, Vâlcea, June 2013)

'Luncaviţa has carried out major infrastructure projects and also smaller awareness projects.
For example, access to mains water: projects worth more than 400,000 Euros. We’re one of the
few villages in Dobrudja that has round-the-clock water all year round. We achieved this thanks
to Knowledge Economy. We received funding for the majority of projects. It’s more than simple:
you apply online.' (Mayor, Luncaviţa commune, Tulcea, June 2013)

                                                  Political participation

The political participation of communities has improved within KEP mainly due to the
development of e-government services, which has resulted in enhanced and more
transparent information flow. As we have already mentioned, KEP provided support to
all communities willing to create their own website. As a result, many KEP communities
have their own website besides the information available on www.ecomunitate.ro. This is
a key outcome indicator for the community empowerment (Rogerson and Itoh, 1998 apud
Gigler, 2004).

The capacity of local authorities to organize online communication and consultations has
increased considerably during the project. In approximately two thirds of the KEP
communities, local authorities are developing and improving web sites, blogs, and
forums. In many communities, the PAPI staff is responsible for creating and updating the
websites of the communities or those of local authorities.

In addition, the enhanced informational capabilities of population resulted in increased
community participation in collective actions and also in enhanced ability to influence the
local decision making processes. Thus, the participation of citizens in consultation
processes increased in the first years of the project, after which it stabilized. The level of
participation in online communication with local authorities is rather weak (table 10), but
most KEP communities are small rural communities, territorially compact, with strong
social networks, in which direct communication is the dominant practice. Online
communication is seen as a major need in relation to the migrants abroad or to the people
moved to a city, but is not favored in relation to people 'next to your door'. Under these
circumstances, most probably the rates of online communication with the local authorities
are not going to increase significantly in the future either.

As a solution, the local authorities from some KEP communities issue a local newspaper
or a newsletter which is distributed to various institutions and to citizens and also posted
on the official website.

The project promoted knowledge sharing activities, which increased the capacity of KEP
communities to coordinate actions with other communities. In this sense, 40 exchange
visits were organized between KEP communities, in which representatives from all 255
KEP communities participated. In addition, five international study visits in Ireland,
Hungary, Lithuania, Denmark and France were realized with the participation of
representatives from 52 KEP communities.78

                                                Cultural identity

In the cultural area, KEP provided through LCENs (at PAPI) assistance services both to
individuals and to communities for creating their own website. In addition, the project
portal www.ecomunitate.ro has posted material about each of the 255 covered
communities. In this way, the knowledge-disadvantaged communities selected within the
project benefited of support in creating a space to disseminate their own content and to
share some of their experiences with other communities and the public in general. This
new opportunity fostered the development of many cultural related activities, mostly in
the area of cultural heritage and tradition revival.

'Through the activities we carry on, especially the library projects, we aim to revitalise our
traditions, to enhance the value of our local cultural heritage. In 2008, we implemented the
monograph project <Saschiz Tales>, purchasing an IT application to manage the books in the
library and creating the village library website. [...] In 2011, we created this historical guide
with volunteers from the community, a large number of them being PAPI Saschiz Volunteers. The
historical guide also includes a multimedia DVD presenting Saschiz, as well as games relating to
the information in the textbook.' (PAPI Manager, Saschiz commune, Mureş, June 2013)

'We’ve revived the tradition of craft items made from rushes and fabrics. Our local artisans
taught the children to make them, too. We take part in international fairs. This year we went to
Vienna. We revived the tradition thanks to Knowledge Economy.' (PAPI Manager, Luncaviţa
commune, Tulcea, June 2013)

Two nodes played a major role in this area, the public library and PAPI, which in many
communities functioned as 'social hub' hosting various community activities unrelated to
the actual use of ICT, from community events, trainings, fairs, medical visits to
weddings.

                                       PAPI - Role of intermediary

The KEP was designed as an ICT intermediary 79 so that to foster the local technical
appropriation and community ownership….The central management team of the project
played a much stronger role at the outset of the project and has gradually transferred the
technical and management skills to the local communities. So, the local communities
have gradually appropriated the technology and gained ownership of the project. Out of
the 255 communities selected initially in the project, 229 (or 90%) communities have
prepared a sustainability plan for the LCEN and are still functional.

PAPI is the central node of LCEN, by design, and it is the main provider of services
within community. As services have been tailored to the community needs, they differ
from one community to another. In 2012, the number of services offered per community
varied from 1 to 22, with an average number of 14 services (KANTOR, 2012).

   An ICT intermediary is defined as a person or organization providing effective support to local communities in the
use and adaptation of technology. (Gigler, 2004)

The visibility of the PAPIs within the communities is high, as half of the population
declared that they know about it. However, in the rural areas more people heard about
and went to PAPI (57% and 33%, respectively) compared with urban areas (41% and
20%). The centers have managed to answer the population’s needs through the offered
services. The majority of those who went to a PAPI with a problem declare to have
solved it (71%, with no significant differences between rural and urban localities).
Therefore the global satisfaction is very high among the people who benefited of any
services or just attended the events organized at the PAPI centers.

A basic condition for the PAPIs to respond to the beneficiaries’ needs is to be well
equipped in terms of ICT infrastructure, connectivity to the Internet, human resources and
premises….The PAPIs delivered a broad range of services to communities. Overall,
about 300 thousands persons declared to have benefited of one or more PAPI services.
About 70% of beneficiaries are from rural areas. More than 70% of beneficiaries declare
to be (very) satisfied with regard to nearly all services.

                                                          Conclusions and recommendations

Following the ICT impact chain: the access to information and ICT has been significantly
improved; the basic ICT skills were ensured; the higher Internet proficiency accompanied
by guidance and support provided through PAPI services has resulted in meaningful use
of Internet, which led to enhanced informational capabilities; and thus the project has had
a positive impact on well-being, both at the individual and community level. The
multiplier effect of informational capabilities varies from one area of life to another.
Positive impact has been highlighted in the informational, social and, especially, in the
cultural areas. Less extended impact was observed in the economic (income generating)
and vertical communication (eGovernment) areas, however high in relative terms
(compared to the national average), particularly taking into consideration that the impact
in these areas is limited by broader socio-economic factors found out of the scope of the
project.

Services provided through LCENs (at PAPI) played the most important role in enhancing
people's informational capabilities and in increasing the odds of meaningful use of
Internet in order to derive benefits in the social, economic, political and cultural areas.
The project played the role of an ICT and social intermediary. A rather successful process
of technical and social appropriation took place at the local level. The prospectives for
the future seem optimistic, according to the mayors of the participating communities.
Nonetheless, sustainability remains an issue to be considered.

ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

         The project and its activities were highly relevant not only to ‘national’ priorities, but also
to international concerns relating to sustainable development and good governance in the e-
government services relation. The consistence and coherence of the proposed objectives and
measures were logically linked to the socio-economic analysis, mutually consistent and were well
embedded in the ‘national’ MCTI targets for small communities. The expected and unexpected
utility effects were realistic and globally satisfactory in the context of wider social, environmental
and economic needs of small communities. The effects obtained in the working programmes
show sustainability, even after the end of the KEP no further public funding are allocated.
         The development of an early education system for small communities should help avoid
the socio-economic losses within services. Improved information society services, inter-ministry
coordination has socio-economic implications through improved efficiency of government.
Improved information society policy and the adoption of ICT methods would have a major socio-
economic impact for Romanian small communities.
         Relating to ‘Overall relevance’, the KBE projects are considered “Highly relevant? to be
sustainable. KBE has been very successful in achieving a measure of institutional sustainability
and a medium term financial sustainability to ensure continued development of the KEP over the
next years, fully supporting the National and European Digital Agenda.
         The principal risk to sustainability is that the recent closure of the KBE programme and
particularly closure of the PMU affect Local Centres which have been so important in driving the
programme, will result in a substantial slow-down of momentum across all outcomes. Whether
this happens will depend on the local, key government staff and the individuals selected for key
posts in the LCeNs. Another significant risk is the rapid turnover of ‘LCeNs’ personnel in private
sector employment.
         The rating of project implementation approach was “High Satisfactory? (on a scale from
unsatisfactory to highly satisfactory). While project coordination was excellent, the full
effectiveness of project implementation was a little difficult by the approach involving numerous
subprojects which were designed only after project inception, which imposed a major
responsibility on project coordination and working in a crisis time.

Efficiency

         Project management was efficient, effective and responsive. Management by the PMU
received particular praise. Financial planning and management appear to have been effective and
prudent, with no instances of serious overspend and a project that had the necessary resources for
a 4 month extension without additional cost.
         Efficiency of the resources allocated with the respect to the outputs and results show that
activities within the KEP Project on Technical Assistance, conducted jointly by schools, local
libraries, allowed the conclusions and recommendations that can be the basis of a new approach
at national level relationship between these institutions in communities. May be mentioned: (i)
Implementing a wider and more effective use of ICT; (ii) Effectiveness in organizations; (iii)
More effective exploitation of ICT in training; and (iv) Effective use of "network" already
established.



                                                  80
        In terms of Cost-Benefit the project activities helped in attracting funding for
communities’ development of more than EUR 250 million. Considering that only one part of the
255 communities accessed these funds and entire KEP used about US$41 million allocated,
resulting impact factor is bigger than 6:1.

Efficacy

         The impact assessment conducted by the World Bank between May-June 2012 in the
project communities (KEP) shows important development values, equalling or exceeding national
and rural area averages along all dimensions of the ICT impact chain.
    - The initially KEP target: 200 communities were achieved by 255 knowledge
         disadvantaged communities (208 communes and 47 small cities) from 1500 applications;
    - the percentage of individuals that use regularly the Internet is 41% in the targeted
         communities, almost equalling the national average of 43% (that includes large urban
         areas), while;
    - the percentage of individuals that used e-government services is of 12%, much higher
         than national averages of 7% (or of the control group of lower than 4%);
    - in the targeted communities with no access to Internet before the project, 46% of the
         relevant population is now connected and use Internet, as opposed to none before the
         project start;
    - 43% of relevant population are satisfied with the results brought by the project, higher
         that the target of 40%;
    - regularity of using the Internet ( percentage of population that used every day) 41%
         versus the target 28%;
    - population that used eGovernment services, 12% vs. the target 11%.
         Initial goals were met and exceeded in most of cases, often KEP communities indicators
are better than national averages since these are aspects considered along the 7 years of
implementation. Project Development Objective indicators targets were exceeded. 229
communities operate efficiently and the level of activity is sustainable in the future. 43% of the
relevant population in these communities have used LCeNs and is satisfied. Regularity of using
internet exceeded the 28% target, now to 41%. Also the quality of ICT as demonstrated by the
use of Internet for the management of official forms reached 12%. Sustainability of LCeNs
increased to 30% and so is fully supporting National and European Digital Agenda strategies. The
project has identified and developed new targets that are one of the keys to its success.
         All, exceeds national averages performance, work as driving factors and must be
mentioned that the project helped to attract other additional funding for communities’
development, of more than EUR 250 million.

Comments on Impact

        Assuming the World Bank’s “Assessment of the Outcomes?, “The project contributed to
accelerating the participation of the targeted 255 knowledge disadvantaged communities in the
knowledge-based society and economy in Romania to a satisfactory extent with substantial
efficiency?. Most of these communities operate satisfactorily towards their sustainable future in
line with their own business plans contributes to the project impact.
        Further challenges for this impact evaluation have been:
      Indicators that permits evaluation of relevance, implementation performance and success
         of the project.
      Implementation of hundreds of equipments, acquisitions, projects and related contracts,
         activities promotion, training, competitions and financing programs.

        The EPSA 2011 Awards at the „Smart Public Service in a Cold Economic Climate? Best
Practice distinction rewards certifies the outstanding results that KEP Project has had until now.

        “The capitalization of a community’s cultural memory can generate the local sustainable
development impact. e-Culture has intervened at the level of local libraries in order to support the
individual development process of children, adults and senior citizens and to offer them access to
local values by means of modern cultural services.
        The main impact of KEP was given by the developed projects in the four area of activity.
The very important impact role of KEP in KBE was played by more projects and related events,
conferences, all sustained by the Portal in area of:
    Local Administration Projects;

Promotional materials was addressed in dozens of models in thousands of copies, dozens of
conferences and events.

    Detailing the impact of the 4 areas of action can remember on:
Local Public Administration-LPA
        The Technical Assistance for the Development of the LCEN Sustainability Plans was
oriented to obtain from the start a higher impact:
     Assistance provided to the LCEN staff,
     Qualitative analysis of the information included in the sustainability plans,
             o Types of funding
             o Services regarded as a priority in ensuring sustainability
     Developing an interaction and networking program for the LCEN staff,
     The LCEN staff assessment,
     Support for sustainable development of local communities,
     Facilitating partnerships between KBE communities and private organizations.
        A very important indicator for the all around evaluation of the KEP impact in
communities is the indicator L1 – “Services provided by the different LCeN nodes?.
        The decrease with impact for some of them, example: the average monthly number of
PAPI users falling from 110 in 2011 to 96 in 2012, means that this evolution is by reason of the
spreading of internet access in communities. Less than 5 percent of KEP communities have for
the network services the sole provider of broadband internet.

eCulture and e-Education
    One of the most important impact was given by e-Culture programme. What do the
participating libraries in the projects, now offer to their community members:
     A framework for designing local groups of initiative;
     Access to information on writing educational, cultural and local development projects,
        based on the community’s tailored needs;



                                                82
       A way to identify funding sources and partners to carry out projects of any kind;
       Assistance in identifying, preserving and protecting local cultural heritage and promoting
        it at European level;
     Access to high speed Internet and different sources of information;
     Introduction to electronic books and eReaders as a modern alternative to classic lecturing;
     Digital literacy and IT skills development services;
     Access to modern digital services - eLearning, Internet banking etc.;
     Easy access to employment opportunities and professional retraining.
    In this way, “print culture? is complemented by the “digital culture?, enabling consumers of
information to simultaneously benefit by the same cultural and educational resource.?
    Of a particular importance is the large number of projects initiated and developed in schools
which reflect a clear image of the impact achieved through this programme in schools.
    List of printed publication, addressed to all units in secondary education and educational
partners in Romania with the highest impact include 15000 Manuals and Guides, Brochures and
Promotional materials.

The Manuals and Guides addressed to all Romanian secondary education units:
    Guide for Teachers “Utilizarea calculatorului personal:aplicare TIC in scoala si afaceri,

Brochures:
    DIGITAL LIBRARY eCULTURA, Programme for innovation in libraries, 28 pages,
      1000 copies.

e-Business
       The impact on companies and businesses area was done in several ways.
       Especially the component 3 “Promotion of e-commerce and innovation support for
MSMEs? with 2 subcomponents had a big impact, indicators being presented in evaluation
Chapters:
            Subcomponent 3.1 Portal for promotion of e-commerce and business networking
            Subcomponent 3.2 Grant Facility

        Grant facility for “Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises? was oriented to investment
projects that were finalised, were allocated funds through the following specifications:
     Tangible assets (technological and ICT equipments): 42%
     Intangible assets (brevets and Software and ICT applications license: 14%
     IT Services: software solutions: 16%
     Consultancy services (business plans, implementation advisory, market analysis) : 12%
     Training services: 11%
     Marketing services (Trades/fairs/ conferences attendance, Web shops, Website,
        Marketing online): 2%
     Audit services: 2%.
The impact was in multiple forms. The competition “e-business entrepreneur? - eAntreprenor ,
(July-September 2012), aimed at creating, supporting, strengthening and promoting an



                                               83
entrepreneurial culture in rural areas and small urban capable of accelerating the initiation of
successful business and increase competitiveness locally.

Qualitative perspective on KEP achievements

         KEP project implementation generated a series of changes in small communities and
these changes are well appreciated by the inhabitants. There was a unanimous opinion that the
program is beneficial to the communities and the infrastructure represents the backbone of any
future achievement based on the shared knowledge. There are features that can easily be listed as
common achievements and KANTOR evaluation reports gives us numerous and detailed results.
         In the first two years 2007 and 2008, main actions of the KEP project have been to
provide the ICT infrastructure which represents the backbone of any future achievement. The
purpose of this evaluation report was to analyze and evaluate the results obtained at the end of
project in comparison with the previous years, using qualitative perspectives.
         Qualitative perspective on KEP achievements and the Sustainability plans share many
elements reflected in the big number of positives results.

Local Public Administration-LPA
         PAPI has been the central KEP implementation point for more qualitative reasons;
addressed to all categories and ages of inhabitants, only new established centres, with
sustainability of the node ensured for many years. Today it is not now possible to imagine a town
hall, a school, a library, people not using ICT in the future. In addition to this fact, KEP is a step
in advance for national strategy for development of e-government, will further increase the
adoption of ICT and its benefits in society and governmental institutions. The impact can be
measured in many ways:
  122 communities submitted 221 projects whose direct beneficiaries are the LPAs;
  65 with 1 project;
  35 communities with 2 projects;
  12 communities with 3 projects;
  8 communities with 4 projects;
  1 community with 5 projects.
In conclusion 58 communities submitted 591 projects whose direct beneficiaries are farmers,
individuals, the number of projects varying between 5 and 125 projects/community.
         Sustainability plans have been assessed both in terms of funding and in terms of priority
of services for sustainability. Types of funding in the financial analysis has led, at a first stage,
to the following findings:
 38% of the communities (96) benefit 100% from LPA (local public administration) funding;
 33% of the communities (84) benefit between 70-90% from LPA funding;
 16% of the communities (42) benefit between 50-70% from LPA funding;
 13% of the communities (33) benefit less than 50% from LPA funding.
     The next stage in the analysis, in terms of priority, has focused on identifying other resources
which may be taken into account by communities in order to ensure co-funding for LCEN
activities.

e-Education
        From a qualitative perspective are the obtained results in ‘Training the LCEN staff’ with
a view to develop PAPI services through ITC:
 103 LCEN administrators were trained in Web Development and ITC tools applied in
    business who carried out the following:
        o 103 web sites,


                                                 84
        o 103 TA reports which will comprise:
   The identification of a software application for business development;
   Market research for services and products diversification;
   The identification of an online promotion of the services provided.
        At level of schools there were initiated 43% more projects that use external sources of
financing such as other programmes. This is a clear measure of the impact that Technical
Assistance for schools had in 2012 in KEP communities.The percentage of pupils using
computers in schools maintained a constant evolution and over 2% more teachers are using
computers in school. Very encouraging for 2012 is the percentage of teachers which are using
computers in schools for added value activities such as the teaching process, preparation of
school projects and preparation of lessons plans. For each of these examples we observed an
increase of around 5% at the level of all teachers, a development clearly supported by the
Technical Assistance for schools.

e-Culture
         The qualitative improvements in e-skills for using ICT in cultural activities meant
creating of:
 Websites and blogs to promote the cultural activities and the services provided by the library;
 Newsletters and digital magazines;
 Movies, audio recordings, photo montages, presentations, promotional materials in digital
    format;
 ICT courses on specific subjects, addressed to various categories of population;
 Library databases, digital book repositories;
 Digitization of books and photographs for the Europeana cultural heritage.
    A list of activities and projects underlines the importance to the library as public institution:
 documentaries and multimedia presentations for preserving and promoting the multicultural
    and multiethnic local values,
 reading and audio sessions were organized, during which a series of literary writers of
    different nationalities were studied,
 cultural items of local heritage were selected and recommended for exposure in the
    Europeana portal.
    A list of cultural projects underlines the large number of developed activities and the
qualitative improving of socio-economic targets:
 “Library - Centre of Information Spreading?,
 “Tradition and Art: Authentic Transylvanian Saxon Fasching?,
 “Memory, tradition, heritage — A resource for the future?,
 “Wings Rustle? Theatre Club?,
 “eReading, eTraditions — Link Between Generations?,
 “eDialogue – Culture without Barriers?,
 “Digital Cultural Bridge through eLibrary and eReaders Services?,
 “Culture by ICT Knowledge?,
 “Reading as a gift?,
 “Rural economy based on knowledge — eGospodari?,
 “Traditional, balanced and healthy nutrition?,
 “The library, promoter of the tourism development and of the crafting ntrepreneurship?,
 “eLibrary & Virtual Technology?,
 “Tradition and Innovation in Your Library? as a Book Club for Senior Citizens.




                                                 85
    e-Culture created opportunities for various categories of beneficiaries, developed the local
volunteering trend and created the qualitative context for other successful projects, to sustain
quantitative results.

e-Business
        The preponderant businesses in KEP communities are specific to the subsistence
agriculture type. Local farmers are mostly individuals and only a small number of registered
SMEs are active. As a result, the surveys had to be adapted to meet new requirements in assessing
the impact of the KEP project over the e-business component.
        In the development of the business sector a principal role was played by PAPIs. From this
perspective, the e-learning and e-business indicators can be correlated.
        In the Grant facility for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, most of the expenses were
directed to the acquisition of the tangible assets, representing technological equipment and ICT
equipment. From those, approximately 62% were ICT equipment.
        The program results analysis presents the higher impact in the communities:

        Approximately 85% of the beneficiaries activate in the service sector, from which 32% in
the commerce sector. There are several explanations that explain this situation: (i) E-business
solutions apply best to service dedicated business; (ii) As for the industry companies, IT solutions
came along with technological automation, so they will be included in the value of technological
equipment; (iii) At present, given the agriculture sector’s structure, e-business solutions, online
marketing and ICT infrastructure are not that useful; (iv) The commerce sector is not financed
through many no reimbursable programmes; and (v) The weak presence of the companies from
industry and agriculture was caused by the following the facts: the investments are oriented
through technological equipment.

Impact at the level of the local communities

         After 2 years of TA, a positive evolution has been noticed in all the communities and
especially in relation to the shift of mindset and approach in the ITC daily use. The impact
obtained by the KBE TA at the level of the local communities:
 250 communities benefitted from training courses in the field of financing request draft, of
     which;
 250 communities drafted a project related to a financing request;
 180 communities (more than 70%) managed to submit financing request declared eligible.
     The total value related to these projects is more than 240 million Euros:
 103 communities were trained to use ITC in the business development;
 50 websites were created for local traders;
 206 communities concluded at least one public-private partnership.
     Between types of financed activities we have:
 Consolidation and diversification of PAPI services (18 projects),
 The LCEN staff training (12 projects),
 -Volunteer based work (1 project).
     More than 85 communities were involved in the implementation of 31 projects financed via
the CONECT grant scheme which led to the following results:
 The organization of 31 training courses, of which, 19 received NATB certification
 More than 630 persons, both LCEN members and other persons in the KBE communities
     participated in the training courses, of which, more than 360 received NATB (CNFPA)
     certification;
     Thus, the level of satisfaction regarding the TA KBE services, registered 89% as compared to
62% level of benefits perceived by the communities in the beginning of the project. Also, the
professional satisfaction of the LCEN staff was extremely positive in 80% of the communities.
Through the numerous and complex activities planned, the PMU team played an important role in
the increase of the level of satisfaction and trust in the services provided.
         One can mention the higher interoperability between programs and activities, the strong
impact in communities, in population, in companies.

ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

         Assesses and rates of “Risk Development Outcome? of the operation presents the risks at
the time of evaluation affecting in maintaining or expected outcomes. Overall risk can be rated80
as “Moderate?. A main risk is represented by the communities’ incapacities to ensure future co-
financing or the human resources needed for future projects’ implementation. The project
extension of 18 months after the original closing date made possible the implementation of risk
mitigation measures identified by mid-term review, as the intensified to communities and schools
that increased the impact and the sustainability of the project.
         Risks are internal, in administrative area, or technical and specific to each operation. The
Rating helps to identify that requires priority or more attention. In plane of social, political and
institutional the risk are exceeded and maybe, only in some points, so that risk can be assessed as
moderate. The first risk at the final of project is to maintain the outcomes. The actual
sustainability of the project impact is significant, 90% at the level of the communities assisted
partially by the project. 229 communities from 255 communities initially supported by the
project, implement measures in line with their approved sustainability plans. 30% of the
communities have concluded partnerships and are implementing various development projects.
Moreover, 51% of communities have projects pending signing. The evaluation of sustainability
indicators demonstrated that 229 communities had the best sustainability premises and 26
communities were at risk regarding the sustainability.

         The results above risks and regarding the positive or negative evolution of the LCEN
performance lead to the following findings: (i) More than 60% of the communities have had a
steady evolution regarding the quality of their activities and services; (ii) The positive evolution
recorded by 40 communities is mainly due to the positive results recorded in terms of number of
projects declared eligible. The best recommendation that can be made in this case is for the Town
Halls to find solutions for overcoming obstacles and keeping the PAPI nodes opened as much as
possible. Perhaps more important than this, is to assure consistency by attracting and maintaining
a long time relationship with their PAPI manager. An alternative to keeping the PAPI open is to
give these responsibilities to the librarian.
         Unfortunately, this is only possible in a small number of cases, as in general the same
communities having difficulties and associated risks keeping the PAPI node functional state
similar issues for the library: personnel is hard to find, there are no available funds or there is a
lack of facilities /locations for them.

ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

Bank Performance

    Services provided by Bank ensured the capacity at entry for all operation and supported
effective implementation, ensuring quality supervision for regular operation inclusive activities
after loan closing.

    Quality at Entry. The Bank provided to KEP funds for the following nodes and supported
activities: (i) the basic and lower secondary schools; (ii) the local administration offices (Town
Halls); (iii) the public libraries; and (iv) Public Information Access Points (PIAPs). The quality at
entry, take into account all operations, the strategic relevance and approach, technical, financial,
economic aspects, also policy and institutional aspects or monitoring and evaluation
arrangements. Risk assessment being ‘Satisfactory’ and no other shortcomings can be mentioned,
so we can evaluate ‘Satisfactory’ quality at enter.

    Quality of Bank supervision. Work Bank activity, from the start of the project, was resumed
at supervision for all operations in proactive identification of opportunities for development and
resolution of appeared threats. The quality of Bank, inclusive activities after loan closing, because
were no shortcomings can be qualified Satisfactory.

    Rating of Overall Bank Performance. Taking into account Bank performance in Assuring
quality at enter and Quality of supervision, and outcomes ratings, the Bank performance was for
both dimension rated ‘Satisfactory’.

Borrower Performance

         The Government of Romania, through the Ministry of Communications and Information
Technology (MCIT) in 2005 has received the loan from the World Bank for financing the
Knowledge Economy Project. The funds were split between more distinct uses such as
Acquisition of Goods, Operational Costs, Training and Monitoring & Evaluation.
According to the Loan Agreement, the objective of the project was to support the Borrower in its
efforts to provide access to ITC services and improve efficiency of the public system to prepare
Romanian's people for the knowledge society and economy.
Overall Borrower Performance can be treated and assumed between Government and PMU
Performance. The first responsibility remain in charge of Government because the fund allocation
was a critique element than influenced the project behaviour.

        Government Performance. The Borrower, including the government (MSI), ensured
quality of preparation and implementation from appraisal towards achievement of development
outcomes for all four components. The impact assessment conducted by the World Bank in May-
June 2012 in the project communities (KEP) shows important development impact, equalling or
exceeding national and rural area averages along all dimensions of the ICT impact chain.
Mentioning minor shortcomings in government performance, the rating can be qualified Highly
Satisfactory. The response of the project to all components is considered completely satisfactory.

         PMU Performance. The PMU has adequate internal controls for the project, including
regular reconciliation of bank accounts, adequate segregation of duties and performs monthly
reconciliation of disbursement summaries of the World Bank with project accounting records.
The PMU uses a comprehensive set of accounting policies and internal control procedures in
accordance with the Romanian legislation and the project financial management practice. The
allocation of counterpart funding was timely.



                                                 89
          Rating of Overall Borrower Performance. The rating for PMU can be qualified to
Highly Satisfactory taking in account the achievements, impact and numerous awards. Taking
into account Borrower performance for both dimension (Government and PMU), and judged in
terms of outcomes ratings of the KEP project, the Borrower Overall Rating was rated ‘Highly
Satisfactory’. Finally it must be mentioned the small number of PMU staff along the project
life, an average of ten, now remaining 6 persons.
