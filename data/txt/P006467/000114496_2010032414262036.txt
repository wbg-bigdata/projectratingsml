For the purposes of this Schedule:
 
(a)
the term "Eligible Categories" means, in respect of CESA, Categories (1) 
through (5) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement and 
in respect of FESA;
(b)
the term "Eligible Expenditures" means expenditures in respect of the 
reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be financed out 
of the proceeds of the Loan
allocated from time to time to the Eligible Categories in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 2.02 and Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and
(c)
the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to two 
million dollars ($2,000,000) to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited in 
the CESA and the FESA, respectively, pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.
Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, payments out of CESA and FESA, as the 
case may be, shall be made exclusively for Eligible Expenditures in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 2.02 of this Schedule. The Account Bank shall authorize 
withdrawals from the CESA or the FESA, as the case may be, on the basis of the 
evidence that the Bank shall have reasonably determined. For each such withdrawal so 
authorized, the Account Bank shall debit or cause to be debited CESA and FESA, as the 
case may be, with the dollar equivalent of the amount of the Eligible Expenditures in 
question in Cruzados Novos, in the case of CESA, or with the actual dollar amount or 
the dollar equivalent of the Eligible Expenditures in currencies other than dollars or 
Cruzados Novos, in the case of FESA.
3.
After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that the CESA and the 
FESA have been duly opened, withdrawals of the corresponding Authorized Allocation and 
subsequent withdrawals to
replenish the CESA or the FESA, as the case may be, shall be made as follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the corresponding amount of the Authorized Allocation, 
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits 
which do not exceed the corresponding amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the 
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw 
from the Loan Account and deposit into the CESA or the FESA, as the case may be, such 
amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested; and
(b)
(i)
For replenishment of the CESA or the FESA, the Borrower shall 
furnish to the 
Bank requests for deposits into the CESA or the FESA 
at such intervals as the 
Bank shall specify.
 
(ii)
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall 
furnish to 
the Bank the documents and other evidence required pursuant

this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect 
of which replenishment is 
requested. On the basis of each such request, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the 
Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account 
and deposit into the CESA or the 
FESA, as the case may be, such 
amount as the Borrower shall have requested and 
as shall have been 
shown by said documents and other evidence to have been 
made 
out of the CESA or the FESA, as the case may be, for Eligible 
Expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan 
Page  15
Account under the respective Eligible Categories, and in the respective 
equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents 
and other

exclusively for Eligible Expenditures.
5.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Bank shall 
not be required to make further deposits into either the CESA or the FESA:
(a)
if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph 
(a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
(b)
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the aggregate 
of Eligible Categories for the Project, less the amount of any outstanding special 
commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions 
with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the 
Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the corresponding Eligible Categories of 
the Project shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the 
Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the 
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the CESA 
or the FESA, as the case may be, as of the date of such notice will be utilized in 
making payments for Eligible Expenditures.
6.
(a)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of 
either the CESA or the FESA: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not 
eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the 
evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the 
Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit 
into the CESA or the FESA, as the case may be, (or, if the Bank shall so request, 
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion 
thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no 
further deposit by the Bank into the CESA or the FESA, as the case may be, shall be 
made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as 
the case may be.

corresponding Eligible
Expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the 
Bank such outstanding amount.
(c)
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the Bank all or any 
portion of the funds on deposit in the CESA or the FESA.

Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of 
this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including 
the General Conditions.
