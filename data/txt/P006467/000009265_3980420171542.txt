MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE THIRD AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan for
agricultural research for US$47.0 million equivalent to Brazil is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years, including
5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. It would
help finance an agricultural research project.
2.       Background.  Until the 1980s, Brazil's agricultural performance
had been generally good with an average annual growth rate of about 4.42.
Almost all of the production growth was attributable to area expansion as
opposed to yield increases. Production was particularly dynamic in the
agricultural frontier areas of the Center-West, but also grew steadily in
the traditional agricultural states of the South. During the early 1980.
there was a relative stagnation in agriculture, followed by a partial
recovery during the second half of the 1980s. Traditional export crops,
and to some extent, food crop production began to increase due, in part, to
significant increases in yields, produced. in large measure, by a highly
successful agricultural research program. EMBRAPA, Brazil's agricultural
research organization, besides being the country's lerJing research
institution. is also the coordinating agency for the cooperative
agricultural research system (SCPA). Besides EMBRAPA, this system, which
is responsible for the execution of the national agricultural research
program (PRONAPA) comprises, as the major participants: (a) state-level
research companies and institutions; (b) universities; and (c) some forty
research institutions and universities throughout the world with whom
EMBRAPA maintains technical cooperation agreements.
3.       EMBRAPA's research station network comprises six regional centers,
twenty-one national centers for commodity research and eight state-level
research centers. In addition, there are seventeen state-owned research
companies. The state level research entities take the findings generated
by EMBRAPA's regional and national centers and incorporate these into
adaptive research programs at the local level. Finally, in support of all
of these research programs, EMBRAPA also operates special service centers
for genetic resources and biotechnology; soil surveys and conservation;
basic seeds production; agro-industry and food technology; plant protection
and environmental research; and irrigation and draiiage.
4.       Based on its experience over the last fifteen years, EMBRAPA
currently sees as major priorities for the national research systems
(i) the development of imp.3ved resource conservation and management
practices at the farm level based on increased kwowledge of the nature and
distribution of the country's productive resourr a, particularly those in
the semi-arid Northeast, the Amazon and the Pantanal regions; (ii) the
strengthening of the state-based agricultural research companies; and
(iii) an improved flow of information between research, extension and the
farming community.



- 2 .
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Banks strategy for Brazil is
to foster macro-economic stability and economic growth, to support
efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in the public sector,
and appropriate targeting and delivery of support services to the poor
while contributing to sound environmental management. The important role
which technology generation and dissemination have played in the growth and
increased productivity of Brazil's agricultural sector is widely
acknowledged. During the past decade the Bank has supported efforts to
strengthen agricultural research at the federal and state level. Under the
Northeast Rural Development Program the Bank is also supporting ten state
research programs. Based on lessons learned it is recognized that
increased attention needs to be focused on the Northeast and Amazon
regions. Due to their more complex agro-ecological and eocio-economic
conditions, these regions have thus far benefitted much less than other
parts of the country from newly generated technologies. Through the
proposed project, the Bank would support Brazilian efforts to develop and
disseminate environmentally sound agricultural production technology which
would contribute to sustained development in two of Brazil's ecologically
most vulnerable and economically depressed regions. The Bank would also
continue its support to EHERAPA and state research agencies in
strengthening and improving the efficiency of the country's cooperative
agricultural research system.
6.       Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project would support the
execution, dissemination and assessment of the results of research programs
designed to contribute to the formulation of sustainable agricultural
production systems in two distinct agro-ecological areas. The project
would also strengthen EMBRAPA's and the state research agencies' capacity
to generate and disseminate technology, and increase the efficiency of the
SOPA in the Northeast through the adjustment of ongoing research programs
and the definition of appropriate procedures to consolidate these programs
under the aegis of EHBRAPA.
7.       Proiect Descrintion.  The project, which would potentially benefit
some 3.5 million medium and smallholder farmers and livestock producers and
their families located in the Northeast and Amason regions, would have the
following five components: (i) development of new crop production
technology at three regional and eight national commodity research centers,
along with crop, livestock and forestry improvement research covering nine
major crops, three minor crop groups, plus beef, dairy cattle, water
buffalo, goats, and forestry, and field-tested at sixteen state-level
adaptive research centers (56S of base costs); (ii) research support
programs in the areas of biotechnology, food technology, soil biology, soil
survey and conservation, irrigation, and environment at eight research
centers (322 of base costs); (iii) technology transfer, including testing
of alternative technology transfer systems, collaborative programs with
private and public agricultural extension services, and increased use of
field tests and demonstration plots (42 of baseline costs);
(iv) institutional development and streagthening of EMBRAPA and other parts
of the SCPA, including reform and unification of management and operational
systems (US$3.6 million, 41 of baseline costs); and (v) project impact
assessment and special studies, including continued monitoring and
evaluation initiated under the second research project (Loan 2016-BR), and
expansion of socio-economic studlies on the impact of research on farm
productivity and incomes (42 of baseline costs). The research programs



would be executed at three regional research centers; thirteen special
services and national commodity research centers; six state-level EMBRAPA
units (UEPAEs); and nine state-owned research agencies under the general
coordination of EMBRAPA. Institutional strengthening would aim at
consolidating procedures for research planning and monitoring by EMBRAPA
and within the various units belonging to the SCPA. Satisfactory
coordination arrangements, including a Project Coordinator and two Regional
Coordinators, are already in place.
8.       The project, which would be carried out over five years, would
provide funds for research infrastructure; incremental machinery, furniture
and equipment needs; graduate studies and training fellowships and short-
term fellowships; consultant and specialized services; and incremental
operating costs. The total cost is estimated at US$97.8 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$47.0 million (48Z).
The Bank loan of US$47.0 million would finance all of the foreign exchange
costs, or about 502 of total project costs, excluding taxes and duties.
Retroactive financing up to a maximum of US$4.7 million equivalent would be
provided for expenditures related to consultancies and training, civil
works, furniture and equipment, and inputs from April 20, 1989 to the date
of loan signing. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements and
the disbursement schedule are in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are in
Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps and Staff Appraisal Report
No. 7991-BR. dated September 8, 1989, are also attached.
9.       Agreed Actions.  Conditions of loan effectiveness would be thats
(a) the minimum number of twenty staff required for the technology transfer
component had been assigned within the various major research units
benefitting from the project; (b) contractual arrangements between EMBRAPA
and participating state research agencies, on terms and con'.itions agreed
with the Bank, would have been signed; (c) the Subsidiary Agreement between
the Borrower and ENBRAPA by which the proceeds of the loan would be passed
to EMBRAPA, wouild have been signed; and (d) the Government would have
provided evidence to the Bank that the 1990 prpposed federal budget
provides for the funds required by EMBRAPA to implement the 1990
consolidated research program funded under the project. During
negotiations, LIBRAPA provided assurances that it would: (a) create and
maintain the positions of a Project Coordinator and two Regional Research
Coordinators in accordance with terms of reference agreed to between
EMBRAPA and the Bank, and thereafter appoint to and maintain in such
positions Coordinators with qualifications and experience satisfactory to
EMBRAPA and the Bank; (b) submit a draft consolidated Annual Operational
Plan (PAT) and budget to the Bank for review and comment by November 30 of
each year; (c) during the third year of the project and assisted by a team
of international experts, it would arrange for a mid-term review of project
activities, impact and priorities; and organizational aspects, including
research planning and coordination, monitoring and evaluation; the te .,.'s
terms of reference would be presented to the Bank for approval by March 31,
1992; the team's report would be presented no later than September 30, 1992
and program adjustments recommended in the report and agreed upon between
EMBRAPA and the Bank would be implemented thereafter; and (d) make
available to each project-executing agency funds in accordance with the
amounts and timetable specified in the approved annual plan.

10.      Benefits.  Although returns to investments in agricultural
research are generally difficult to quantify, past investments have made
significant contributions to the country's expanding agricultural
production. Moreover, returns would be expected to be relatively higher in
areas where the current level of technology ig relatively low, as Is the
case in Brazil's Northeastern and kmazon regions. The total rural
population in the project area amn nts to some 18 million people or more
than half of the country's rural population. The proposed project would
give particular attention to applied research protrams that owold benefit
medium and small-scale farmers and livestock producers in these regions.
In addition, the project would be expected to have a beneficial impact on
the environment through its emphasis on the development of sustainable
agricultural and livestock production technologies for two of Brasil's most
fragile regions. finally, by strengthening state research companies and by
improving the national research system's administration and coordination,
particularly in the Northeast, it would contribute to increased public
sector efficiency.
11.     RLiks.  Optimum returns to research depend upon the degree of
coordination between research and extension at the state and field level
and the feed-back received from farmers. The proposed project would
strengthen the technology diffusion process and the linkages between
research, extension and the farmers. Research results can also be
nullified by unfavorable policy decisions affecting returns to farming.
However, other Bank-supported lending operations in the sector, ranging
from policy-based sector lending to regional rural development (NRDP/PAPP
and Northwest Development Program) and operations in the irrigation
subsector, are designed as parts of a coherent strategy and effectively
reduce this type of risk. Finally, delays and shortfalls In counterpart
funding from the Federal Government could represent a major risk. The
support which agricultural research enjoys at the Federal and State level,
together with a sound annual planning and budgeting process should help to
mitigate this risk.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
