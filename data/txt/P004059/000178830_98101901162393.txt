KOREA
APPRAISAL OF
KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK
SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
i.        This report recommends a loan of $60 million to Korea Development
Bank (KDB). It is by far the largest institution in Korea providing medium-
and long-term capital to industry, both public and private. Directly and
indirectly, KDB was involved in close to 40% of total fixed capital forma-
tion in Korea in 1973. Its loans outstanding to the manufacturing sector
at the end of 1973 accounted for 40% of all medium- and long-term loans by
the entire banking sector. Exports by KDB's clients in 1972 accounted for
41% of Korea's total exports of manufactures, and in the same year companies
assisted by KDB provided a quarter of total industrial employment and out-
put in the country. KDB's guarantee portfolio accounts for about 45% of
Korea's total foreign term debt.
ii.       KDB is 100% Government owned, and its management is also appointed
by the Government. The present Governor, who has held office since August
1972, is a former Vice-Minister of Finance. The Deputy-Governor and all
the 7 members of the Board of Executive Directors have reached their present
positions after long service with KDB. Both the management of KDB and its
staff are experienced and competent.
iii.      KDB's operational procedures are well developed and clearly defined.
Its appraisal standards are generally satisfactory although the appraisal of
economic aspects of projects could be improved. However, a sample test
showed its projects generally to have satisfactory economic rates of return.
Supervision, procurement and disbursement procedures and practices are
satisfactory. Operational planning is done through an annual Operational
Program, subject to approval by the Government. KDB sets its operational
policies independently, but within the broad economic policies and priorities
of the Government. For large projects of national priority, for which the
Government provides the funds, and for guarantee operations, the basic
decisions are essentially taken by the Government although KDB does influence
the project formulation and retains the right to refuse financing projects
which in its judgement do not meet its standards and criteria. KDB has full
autonomy for all projects which it finances from funds raised by itself
independently of the Government, including those from international institu-
tions. It is estimated that in the 18-months period ended June 30, 1974
projects referred to it by the Government accounted for somewhat less than
40% of total operations. There is no doubt that KDB will have complete
independence and autonomy in making decisions regarding projects to be
financed from the proceeds of the proposed loan.



- ii -
iv.       During its 20 years of operations, KDB's loan commitments have
amounted to W 659 billion ($1.4 billion equivalent) of which about 85% were
committed during the past 6 years. KDB's foreign loan operations have in-
creased since 1971, when it obtained its first loan from the Asian Develop-
ment Bank. Foreign currency loans outstanding now amount to W 32.0 billion
and account for 8% of total loans outstanding as of December 31, 1974. The
average size of project loans to the public sector (which account for about
two-thirds of total loans) is W 514.7 million ($1.1 million equivalent),
compared with W 67.4 million ($139,000 equivalent) for loans to projects
in the private sector. By sector, KDB's portfolio covers a broad spectrum.
Geographically, KDB's portfolio follows the pattern of industrial dis-
tribution in Korea.
v.        KDB's equity investments amount to W 65.9 billion ($136 million
equivalent) in 26 companies. Only one company is in the private sector;
25 companies accounting for about 85% of total investments are in the public
sector. In some companies KDB's present holding amounts to more than 50% of
the share capital. Except in two companies, KDB's holdings are intended to
be temporary, to be sold as soon as KDB prudently can; KDB's policy in this
respect is clearly stated and the performance matches the declared intentions
(in 1974, KDB sold its holdings in 3 companies). KDB's investments are
predominantly in the manufacturing sector.
vi.       KDB's total outstanding guarantees amounted to W 1,311 billion
($2.7 billion equivalent) as of December 31, 1974, of which 95% were external
repayment guarantees. Decisions concerning external repayment guarantees
are taken by a ministerial-level Government committee; KDB's input comes at
an early stage in the form of a report to that Committee. In view of the
extent of the potential risk to KDB arising out of its guarantee operations,
an arrangement satisfactory to the Bank, has been worked out between the
Government and KDB which provides, in brief, that if and when a default shall
occur under any guarantee covered by the arrangement, the Government shall
take the necessary steps in order to enable KDB to meet all obligations
falling due under the default. The arrangement provides further that in
case a defaulting client becomes bankrupt, the Government shall assume all
obligations under the guarantee contract. A similar arrangement has also
been worked out in respect of KDB's loans to Korea Electric Company.
vii.      Before the Bank undertook its appraisal, KDB engaged Arthur Young
& Company, a firm acceptable to the Bank, to audit its 1973 accounts. The
auditors have given an unqualified report. KDB has a strong equity base
with long-term debt to equity ratio of 3.0:1 without including guarantees
in debt, and 11.7:1 if guarantees are included (December 31, 1974). Its
liquidity position is also satisfactory. KDB's profitability has been low
mainly because the Government does not intend it to be a profit-making
institution, and its 'spread' on borrowed funds has been thin. KDB's loan
portfolio is sound, with low arrears. Its equity investment portfolio is
also maturing and has started producing a reasonable yield.  Defaults by
guarantee clients have been negligible.



- iii -
viii.     KDB has estimated that its commitments in the future will increase
at an annual rate of 7%, and for 1975-76 will amount to W 385.7 billion
(795 million equivalent). Considering the Government's overall growth rate
targets and estimates of investment demand, KDB's business forecast is
probably too conservative. KDB estimates that for the year 1975 and 1976,
it would need to raise W 420.7 billion to meet the projected commitments
and maintain a satisfactory liquidity position. Its plan to raise the needed
resources, discussed in Chapter V, includes a loan of W 29 billion ($60 mil-
lion) from the Bank. KDB's financial position in the future should remain
satisfactory.
ix.       A loan of $60 million to KDB is recommended.  It would meet a
part of KDB's capital needs. The Bank by lending to KDB could hope to
achieve two objectives:  (a) to provide finance for the manufacturing sector,
which sector is expected to remain the principal engine of growth in the
economy; and (b) to have a constructive influence on KDB as an institution.
Although both public and private sector projects will be eligible, KDB
proposes to use the Bank loan proceeds principally for projects in the
private manufacturing sector, giving preference to export-oriented projects.
KDB has given the Bank to understand that it would not use the proceeds of
the proposed loan on just a few large projects; the amount of individual
subloans will not normally exceed $4 million each. A maximum debt/equity
ratio of 5:1 is proposed with debt defined as all borrowings with a maturity
of more than one year. A free limit of US$750,000 is recommended, with an
aggregate free limit of $18 million. The minimum interest rate on subloans
charged by KDB will be the Bank's rate plus 2%, with the exchange risk being
borne by the sub-borrower.
x.        During negotiations for the proposed loan, understandings were
reached with KDB (recorded in agreed minutes) on the following:
(a) amendments to the Policy Statement, to be adopted
by the Executive Directors of KDB before the
effectiveness of the proposed Loan (paragraph 2.03);
(b) KDB's economic appraisal of projects and, more
specifically, that it would introduce economic rate
of return analysis for all sub-projects involving
loans of US$750,000 or more and to be financed from
the proposed loan. The applicability of the economic
rate of return analysis to projects to be financed
from KDB's other resources will be discussed by the
Bank's first Supervision Mission (paragraph 2.11);
(c) arrangements between the Government and KDB regarding
KDB's guarantee portfolio and its loans to Korea
Electric Company (paragraph 3.17 and 4.12);



- iv-
(d) the loan proceeds will be used mainly to finance
projects in the private manufacturing sector and
the entire amount of the proposed loan will not be
used to finance just a few large projects (the amount
of individual sub-loans will not normally exceed
US$4 million each) (paragraph 5.13); and
(e) in order to improve its debt service coverage, KDB will
issue more long term debentures than short term
issues as has been the case in the past, and the
Government will assist KDB in this regard by being
prepared to guarantee such issues (paragraph 5.10).



KOREA
APPRAISAL OF
KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Korea and Korea DeVelopment Bank (KDB) approached
the Bank early in 1972 for financial assistance to KDB. An exploratory
mission visited KDB in October 1972 and concluded that there were some
problems which precluded an immediate loan. Throughout 1973 and the first
half of 1974 discussions took place between the Government, KDB and the Bank
to resolve these problems. By July 1974, sufficient progress had been made
(including completion of a satisfactory audit of KDB's accounts by in-
dependent auditors acceptable to the Bank) to warrant an appraisal of KDB,
which took place in August 1974. This report is based on that appraisal
and recommends a loan of US$60 million to KDB. The report deals with all
aspects of KDB as an institution, its past operations and their impact on
Korea's economy, its financial condition and prospects, and makes recom-
mendations concerning the terms of the proposed loan. The Bank's latest
report on the Korean economy is "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
the Republic of Korea" (332-KO) dated February 20, 1974. An Economic
Mission returned in February 1975 after completing field work in Korea; its
report is under preparation. Those aspects of the economic situation which
have direct relevance to KDB's operations are summarized in Annex I.
II.  INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Functions and Policies
2.01      Broad functions.  KDB was established in 1954 after the Korean
War as a wholly-owned Government Bank, under the Korea Development Bank Act,
succeeding the Industrial Bank of Korea which had existed since 1918. KDB's
primary purpose, as described in the Act (Article 1), is "to supply and
administer funds, in conformity with Government policies, for financing
necessary industrial projects with a view to expediting the industrial
rehabilitation and economic development of the nation." It finances such
sectors as electric power, coal mining, shipbuilding, iron and steel manu-
facture, (defined as "priority" industries by Presidential decree), and
other industries to the extent that they are not adequately financed by
other institutions. Over the years, KDB has shifted its focus from post-
war rehabilitation to development projects. At the same time, it has widened
the scope of its assistance from Won lending only to investment in equities,
foreign currency loans and guarantees. In the late sixties and very
early seventies, the Government transferred to KDB the shares it held in
many industrial enterprises, and KDB began acting as a holding company.



- 2 -
These holdings have declined in the recent past, and will continue to decline,
as KDB liquidates its majority holdings in line with the Government's
policy of a gradual transfer of ownership to the private sector.
2.02      The KDB Act allows KDB to (i) extend long-term loans (in both
local and foreign currency) to public and private industrial firms; (ii) make
working capital loans (in Won) to enterprises that have obtained long-term
loans from KDB or in the equity capital of which the Government or KDB has
invested; (iii) subscribe, underwrite and/or guarantee debentures issued
by public and private enterprises; (iv) make equity investments and under-
write share issues; (v) extend guarantees both in Won and foreign currencies;
and (vi) provide foreign exchange banking services (since 1968) for its
clients and Government enterprises. In addition KDB undertakes many non-
financial activities which are described in paragraph 3.23.
2.03      Policies.  KDB's operations are governed by the KDB Act, KDB's By-
Laws, Operating manuals and a Policy Statement adopted by its Board in 1970
when ADB made its first loan to KDB. The Policy Statement summarized prin-
ciples defined in the other documents and added a few new ones. It con-
tained the usual "financial prudence" limits on its operations (e.g.
limits on its total equity investments and equity investment in a single
enterprise, limit on total assistance to any single enterprise, etc.). The
Policy Statement, however, allowed KDB to exempt from the various limits all
transactions relating to public sector and KDB invested projects. The
Policy Statement also defined some of the limits in terms of KDB's net
worth and "quasi-equity" 1/ whereas, in fact, KDB had no "quasi-equity". As
of June 30, 1974, 64% of KDB's total portfolio was accounted for by the
"exceptional" projects.  Because of the exceptions allowed, the Policy State-
ment was an ineffectual instrument of policy guidance and control. The
Policy Statement has been revised to provide for a uniform financial
discipline for all projects for which KDB assumes the risk; the revised
Policy Statement is given in Annex 2. Exceptions to the various limits
would still be permitted on the basis of the merits of individual cases.
KDB understands that the "exceptions" will have to be very few indeed and
to be fully justified in each case. The revised Policy Statement also contains
a new clause emphasizing that KDB shall follow sound financial policies,
levy financial charges to cover not only all expenses but also to build
adequate reserves, etc. The adoption of the Statement by KDB's Board is a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan.
Organization
2.04      Management.  KDB is administered by a full-time Board of Executive
Directors composed of the Governor, the Deputy Governor, both appointed by
1/   ADB and KDB understand this to mean those portions of Government loans
which are repayable after 15 years. The loans are not subordinated,
however.

the President of the Republic upon recommendation by the Minister of Finance,
and seven directors appointed by the Minister of Finance upon recommendation
by the Governor. The present members of the Board are listed in Annex 3.
There is also an Auditor appointed by the Minister of Finance.  The terms
of office of Board members and the auditors are three years but they can be
reappointed.
2.05      The present Governor Mr. Woun Gie Kim, who is 50, was appointed in
August 1972. Most of his career has been spent in the various Government
Departments dealing with fiscal and monetary matters. Just before his appoint-
ment as the head of KDB, he was the Vice-Minister in the Ministry of Finance.
The Deputy Governor and all of the present Executive Directors have spent
their entire career in KDB and its predecessor, the Industrial Bank of Korea.
The Board is a competent and efficient body; all members are well qualified
and experienced. The Governor is well-respected within KDB, in private
financial and business circles, and in the Government. He provides effective
leadership to KDB.
2.06      Staff.  KDB has more than 1,700 staff members of whom about a
third can be considered as professionals. About a fifth of the total staff
is located in Branches or Representative Offices. About 200 of the profes-
sional staff have been trained in Japan or the USA. Most of the Department
Directors have served KDB for many years. Seniority is the main considera-
tion in staff promotion. Professional staff are recruited just after
finishing school through open competitive examination and they usually spend
their entire career with KDB. It has a systematic training and career
development program for all staff.
2.07      Departmental and Branch Structure,  KDB's organization is shown
in Chart 1. The Head Office has twenty departments, and KDB has 9 Branches
and 2 Representative Offices in New York and Tokyo. The departments can be
grouped according to their functions as follows: (i) Line Operations: Loan
Departments I and II, Foreign Loan Department, Foreign Guarantee Departmentt
Share Holding Department, and Special Loan Department; (ii) Supporting:
Technical Services Department, Business Analysis Department, Foreign Capital
Department, Research Department, and International Department; (iii) Plannirg
and Control: Planning Department, Business Control Department, Special CredLit
Control Department, Securities Department and Audit Department; (iv) General
Administration: Personnel Department, General Services Department and
Securities Control Department; and (v) Secretariat.
2.08      The first group of Departments is responsible for the main functions
of processing all loan, investment and guarantee applications and for all
follow-up work. The second group of Departments performs support functions
such as surveying the financial condition of industrial enterprises in Korea
and keeping a central credit file on all clients with loans in excess of
Won 50 milliotn, handling the management consultancy function of KDB, compila-
tion of statistics and economic reports on domestic and international



- 4 -
developments and on any other subject proposed by management or other depart-
ments. The functions of the other three groups are implicit in the names
of the Departments.
2.09      Branches.  KDB has nine Branches, one in each of the eight mainland
provinces, and a ninth branch recently opened in Ulsan. The Branches have
responsibilities similar to those of the Loan Departments at Head Office for
loans under their jurisdiction. The jurisdiction is determined, in general,
according to the location of projects. Large, Government directed projects
and foreign loans, however, are always handled at Head Office. Branches
can approve loans at their own discretion up to a certain amount. (Normally
they can approve loans to a total of Won 60 million within six months, but
not more than Won 20 million per loan; these loans are mostly for short-term
working capital requirements.) The two representative offices in Tokyo
and New York were set up mainly for investment promotion and fund raising
purposes. Two more representative offices are planned to be opened in
Europe in the near future.
Procedures
2.10      Appraisal.  Loan applications are submitted either through Branches
or directly to Head Office; larger loans and foreign currency loans, however,
are always processed at Head Office. Full appraisal is undertaken after
"pre-screening" which includes a personal talk by the Department Director
with the customer. In case imports of equipment and machinery are required,
approval is also sought from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry which
mainly reviews the need for imports. For guarantees, clients apply to
KEB and the Foreign Capital Inducement Deliberations Committee. The FCIDC
sends the application to KDB for analysis by its Technical Services Depart-
ment. On the basis of the resultant assessment, the FCIDC takes a decision
and conveys it to KDB. If the decision is favorable, KDB gives the guarantee
after obtaining a counter guarantee from KDB.
2.11      Except as noted later in this paragraph, KDB's appraisals are
usually thorough and systematic, and cover all major aspects of the project
concerned. Technical and financial appraisals are usually quite satisfactory.
Appraisal of economic aspects at the prescreening stage consists of a test
for eligibility according to priorities listed in the KDB Act; at the detailed
appraisal stage it consists of an analysis of partial indicators such as value
added, foreign exchange savings or earnings and employment creation. At
present KDB does not undertake the calculations of effective rate of protec-
tion or economic rate of return. (For a commentary on the impact of past
operations, see Annex 10). The staff does have the professional competence
to undertake fairly sophisticated economic analysis, and KDB has undertaken
to start doing economic rate of return analysis for all subprojects requiring
a loan of US$750,000 or more and to be financed from the proposed loan. The
question of expanding the applicability of the economic rate of return



- 5 -
analysis to other projects (whether or not financed by the proceeds of the
proposed Bank loan) will be decided during the visit of the first Bank
Supervision Mission after reviewing the experience gained by KDB in using
the economic rate of return analysis for all Bank subprojects involving
financing of US$750,000 or more.
2.12      For the projects for which the Government rather than KDB takes
the basic decisions (Government-directed projects), KDB's appraisals largely
consist of checking and supplementing the evaluation work done by the minis-
tries concerned. For very large projects such as loans to Korea Electric
Company and Pohang Steel Company, KDB does not prepare an appraisal report
but is consulted by the Government at the time of project formulation.
(see also paragraph 2.18).
2.13      Follow-up.  KDB's follow-up procedures are thorough and well
organized.   Specific guidelines have been established to handle supervision
which is undertaken by the operational departments at Head Office or the
Branches, depending on the location of projects (see paragraph 2.10). Ap-
praisal officers normally are also responsible for the follow-up. During
the construction stage the Technical Services Department conducts spot checks
and upon completion prepares a completion report. Field visits are conducted
systematically for completed projects, including occasional field audits.
Clients have to submit periodic reports and the KDB management is kept
informed of the progress of projects. Projects in arrears for more than six
months are transferred to the Special Loan Department for assistance which
may include the deputation of specialists to the troubled project for
several months. If the condition of the enterprise does not improve and
there is no hope of progress or if the client is in default on four
consecutive instalments due, then the project is transferred to the Read-
Justment Corporation (See Annex 8) which takes the necessary legal action
for recovery of amounts due.
2.14      Procurement and Disbursement.  Procurement and Disbursement pro-
cedures are well designed, are strictly enforced and are satisfactory. Pro-
curement in the case of foreign loans is done in three ways: (1) through
OSROK (Office of Supply, Republic of Korea), (2) by the sub-borrower through
formal competitive bidding and (3) by the sub-borrower without competitive
bidding. 1/ If the third method is used, KDB checks whether the clients'
selections were appropriate and reasonably priced.
2.15      In the case of a domestic currency loan, KDB opens a credit control
account to which the full loan amount is credited as soon as the loan is
formally committed; amounts are considered as fully disbursed at this stage.
Actual payments are then made from that account as expenditures are certified
and reimbursed, usually after plant visits and checking of documents. The
established disbursement procedures are effective in making sure that with-
drawals from the credit control account are made only for the purposes of
the loan. For foreign currency loans, KDB follows the procedures laid down
by the lending institutions. KDB should face no particular problem in
1/   Projects accounting for 10% of foreign loans have used this method.



-6-
observing the Bank procedures as it is already familiar with similar procedure
prescribed by ADB.
2.16      Operational planning.  Within the framework of its long-term plans,
KDB does its detailed operational planning on an annual basis by preparing
an Operational Program (OP) which is a requirement under the KDB Act, and
which has to be approved by the Government. The Operational Program is
essentially a statement of projected sources and uses of funds in the following
year. On the "uses" side, the input comes from the operating departments and
branches which project demand from existing or new clients, and from various
Government ministries which propose specific projects for financing by KDB.
The sources section details how KDB expects to raise resources to meet the
projected uses, what KDB expects to receive from the national budget, (which
becomes a commitment by the Government when it approves the Operational
Program), how much it plans to raise by issuing IFDs, how much from the
various funds (e.g. National Investment Fund, Rationalization Fund, etc.),
how much by borrowing from foreign sources, etc. The Operational Program
for 1974 is given in Annex 4.
Relations with Government
2.17      As the sole shareholder of KDB, the Government appoints the Board
of Executive Directors, including the Governor. However, all the Executive
Directors, except the Governor, have always been appointed by promotion from
within KDB, ensuring that the Board is composed of experienced professionals.
KDB's policies are set by its Board independently within the framework of
overall economic policies and priorities set by the Government as expressed
through such instruments as the Five-Year Plans. The Government exercises
overall control of KDB through the mechanism of annual Operational Programs
(paragraph 2,16). Changes in KDB's Operating Manual, By-laws and annual
budget are also subject to Government's approval. The Government may also
effect basic changes in KDB's functions by amending the KDB Act, as it did
to enable KDB to give guarantees (paragraph 3.14).
2.18      In its decision making process, KDE is not entirely independent.
For very large projects of national priority for which the Government also
provides the needed resources, the basic decision is taken by the Government.
However KDB retains the right to refuse to finance any project which it
does not judge to conform to its standards and criteria. KDB has full
autonomy in investment decisions on all projects which it finances from funds
which it raises independently of the Government (including those from
international institutions with Government guarantees). As for guarantee
operations, KDBts input comes at an early stage when it examines the proposals
at the request of the Economic Planning Board (paragraph 2.10), and a
separate arrangement has been made in respect of these operations (paragraph
3.17).  It is estimated that in the 18 month period ended June 30, 1974,
projects referred to KDB by the Government accounted for 39% of total opera-
tions. On the basis of KDB's experience in the use of funds from inter-
national institutions (ADB, KFW, AID), there is no doubt that KDB will have
complete independence and autonomy in making decisions about projects to be
financed from the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan.



'2.19      Working relations between KDB and the Gcvernment are close and
cordial. The Governor of KDB sits on various ministerial level committees;
other staff represent KDB on lower level committees. KDBts professionalism
is respected by the Government and it is not infrequent for KDB to receive
requests for advice on specific subjects.
III. OPERATIONS AND RESOURCES
Summary of Operations
3.01      KDB's financial assistance may be classified in three major
categories: (a) loans in domestic and foreign currencies for equipment
financing and working capital; (b) investments in equity shares, corporate
and municipal bonds and debentures; and (c) guarantees in domestic and
foreign currencies. KDB finances projects in both the private and public
sectors. The following summary indicates the magnitude and composition
of KDB's operations in the past six years (billion Won):
1969    1970    1971    1972    1973        1974

In addition to its financial activities, KDB also renders various non-
financial services which are described in paragraph 3.23.

Lending Operations
3.02      Trend of commitments.  KDB's loan commitments, disbursements,
repayments and amounts outstanding are summarized in Annex 5.  During its
twenty years of operations, KDB's total loan commitments have amounted to
W 659 billion ($1.4 billion equivalent), of which over 85% were committed
during the six years ended December 31, 1974, reflecting a significant
acceleration in KDB's lending in recent years. During this six year period,
loan commitments have shown a steadily rising trend. However, loan commit-
ments in 1972 were exceptionally large because of the direct impact on
KDB's operations of the economic, fiscal and monetary measures taken by the
Government in that year (Emergency Decree of August 3, 1972) as a result of
which there was a sudden jump of W 42.31 billion in KDB's loan commitments.
3.03      Foreign currency loans.  As of December 31, 1974, total outstanding
loans amounted to W 425.69 billion ($878 million equivalent) relating to
2,070 projects.  Domestic currency loans (W 393.67 billion or $ 812 million
equivalent for 1,773 projects) accounted for 92% of total outstanding loans,
while foreign currency loans (W 32.0 billion or $ 66 million equivalent for
297 projects) accounted for the remaining 8%. KDB started its foreign
currency lending operations in 1960 when the Government allocated to it an
AID loan. KDB's foreign currency loans have increased significantly since
KDB obtained its first loan directly from ADB in 1970; outstanding foreign
currency loans increased by about five times from W 4.9 billion equivalent
as of December 31, 1970 to W 32.0 billion as of December 31, 1974. Despite
this rapid increase, the proportion of foreign currency loans in KDB's total
loan portfolio did not rise much because domestic currency loan commitments
were also increasing rapidly during the period. All foreign currency sub-loans
are for equipment purchases and most of them are made from credits obtained
from international institutions; loans obtained from foreign commercial
banks are mostly used in making domestic currency loans, with the exchange
risk borne by the sub-borrower.
3.04      Short-term loans.  Of the outstanding amount of domestic currency
loans, W 53.21 billion (1,250 projects) were working capital loans (for up to
one year) and W 340.46 billion (523 projects) for capital goods or equipment
loans. KDB makes working capital loans only to its long-term borrowers,
Government projects, or projects which KDB itself controls or manages. The
objective behind providing working capital (operating) loans is to ensure that
KDB-financed projects and Government projects do not run into operating
difficulties due to paucity of short-term funds. KDB does not compete with
commercial banks.
3.05      Features of loan commitments.  Annex 6 gives an analysis of loan
commitments as at December 31, 1973.1/ About 33% of outstanding loans by
amount related to private sector projects and 67% to public sector projects.
1/   Analysis of loan commitments is for the year ended December 31, 1973
as detailed data for 1974 is not yet available.



-9
In terms of number of projects, the picture is quite different: 80% of
loans have gone to the private sector and 20% to the public sector. This
is explained by the fact that Government promotes and operates only large
industrial projects which are judged to be beyond the financial capacity of
the private sector. Consequently, the average size of loans made to the
public sector (W 514.7 million or $1.1 million equivalent) is much higher
than the average size of loans to the private sector (W 67.4 million or
$139,000 equivalent). Large Government projects have heavily influenced
the size distribution of KDB loans, e.g. only 15% of its loans exceeded
W 200 million each by number but such loans account for 78.5% of the total
outstanding loans by amount.
3.06      About two-thirds of the outstanding loan amount relates to new pro-
jects. By sector, KDB's loan portfolio covers a broad spectrum. The two
largest recipient sectors are power generation (38.5%) and manufacturing
(38.2%) followed by transportation (7.8%), banking and insurance (5.9%),
mining and quarrying (4.9%), construction (3.4X) and miscellaneous industries
(2.3%).   If KDB's loans to Korea Electric Company are excluded (see para-
graph 4.12), manufacturing would account for 61.3% of the total loan portfolio.
Within the manufacturing sector, the portfolio appears well diversified with
fabricated metal products and machinery manufacturing taking the largest
share (27%) followed by basic metals (22%), chemicals and petroleum (16%)
and others (20%). Geographically, KDB's loan commitments have followed the
pattern of industrial location in Korea. The Seoul and Busan cities have
accounted for about 53% of total IDB loan commitments. With increasing
Government emphasis on wider geographic dispersal of new industrial invest-
ment, KDB should achieve a better regional spread in the future; no quick
change in regional distribution of its overall portfolio can be expected,
however.
3.07      KDB's interest rates.  As discussed in Annex 1, interest rates in
Korea are controlled by the Government. Prevailing interest rates in Korea
and those charged by KDB are given in Annex 1B and 1C. The general interest
rates on equipment loans in domestic currency is 15.5% and that on foreign
currency loans is 9-10.5% with the exchange risk assumed by the subborrower.
Considering the present and estimated rate of inflation for the foreseeable
future and currently estimated opportunity cost of capital in Korea, the
Bank has informed the Government that the current rates are low. A dialogue
on this matter involving KDB, the Government and the Bank will be resumed
in the light of the findings and conclusions of the Basic Economic Mission
which has just returned from Korea.  In the meantime, KDB will on-lend the
proceeds of the proposed Bank loan at a rate two percentage points above the
Bank's lending rate.
Investment Operations
3.08      A summary of KDB's investment operations during the last six years
is given in Annex 7. KDB's total investment portfolio as of December 31,



- 10 --
1974 stood at W 76.0 billion ($157 million equivalent) of which about 87% was
in the form of equity shares (W 65.9 billion) and 13% in bonds and debentures
(W 10.1 billion). During this period, equity investments increased at an
annual rate of 49%. The importance of bonds and debentures in KDB's total
investments has steadily declined. Most of the bonds and debentures held
by KDB were issued by various municipalities.
3.09      Mode of acquisition.  KDB has acquired its equity investments
through (a) direct cash subscriptions, (b) conversion of loans into shares,
and (c) transfers of shares in industrial companies from the Government as
contributions to paid-in capital. Total equity investment of W 65.9 billion
as of December 31, 1974, was acquired as follows:
Billion Won       %
Direct cash subscriptions                43.1         65.4
Conversions of loans                      5.4         8.2
Transfers from Government                17.4         26.4
65.9       100.0
It is significant that during the three vears ended December 31, 1974, net
outstanding investment in shares acquired through direct cash subscriptions
and conversions of loans increased by 158% and 56% respectively while there
was a net decline of 74% in the total amount of shares transferred from the
Government. This trend is likely to continue in the future.
3.10      Extent ofonrship.  Out of the total of 26 companies in which
KDB has an equity investment, its shareholding in 7 companies amounts to
more than 50% of their respective paid-in capital. Such companies account
for 35% (W 23.3 billion) of KDB's total equity investments. In 6 of these
7 companies, KDB has invested either directly or through conversion of loans
and in one company investment was acquired partly through direct investment
and loan conversion and partly through share transfers from the Government.
Five companies accounting for 91% of total investment in thos 7 companies, are
in the manufacturing sector, including a steel mill, an electric machinery
making project and a fertilizer project. All these projects fall within the
category of high priority projects. The two non-manufacturing companies -
Korea Industrial Leasing Company (KIL) and Readjustment Corporation (RC) -
both 100% owned are in effect corporate extensions of KDB operations. KIL
is engaged in the business of leasl.g industrial machinery and equipment,
while RC acts as a collection agent for KDB as well as other financial
institutions in the country. Some aspects of the constitution and operations
of these two companies are described in Annex 8. Except for KDB's invest-
ments in KIL and RC, investments in all other companies are of a temporary
nature to be sold as soon as KDB prudently can, and most of them were made
to safeguard its existing investments (including loans) by taking over
majority ownership to control their management. During 1969-1974, KDB sold
its holdings in 10 companies for a total amount of W 4.9 billion.



- 11 -
3,11      KDB Shareholding Act and Shareholding Administration Fund.  The KDB
Shareholding Act which also created the Shareholding Administration Fund (SAF),
was approved and promulgated in August 1969. Its purpose was to give KDB
closer and more effective control over the management and finances of companies
in which KDB had majority holding (excluding KIL and RC) with a view to
ensuring their sound growth. Under the provisions of this Act, a Shareholding
Administration Committee (SAC) was set up comprising nine members including
the Ministers of Economic Planning Board (also Chairman of SAC), Finance,
Agriculture and Forestry, Commerce and Industry, Construction and Trans-
portation, the Governor of KDB and two independent persons from the public
with knowledge of and background in business administration. The SAF,
maintained within KDB, represents a separate accounting of all investments
in KDB-controlled enterprises, funds generated by their sales and dividend
collections. The innovative mechanism set up by the Shareholding Act has
given an opportunity to KDB, on the one hand to keep a close watch on the
management and operations of the companies brought within its ambit and,
on the other hand, effectively to influence the various Government policies
directly affecting the operation of such companies. This unusual arrangement
has produced good results; most of these companies have shown considerable
improvements in their operational performance (see paragraph 4.11) enabling
SAC so far to liquidate KDB's shareholding in 10 companies of the 17 companies
brought within its purview.
3.12      Exposure in subsidiaries.  KDB's investment in 7 companies exceeds
50% of their respective paid-in capital. Two of these, KIL and RC, are in
effect corporate extensions of KDB operations. The investment in the other
5 companies does not constitute unduly high risk to KDB's portfolio. This
assessment is based on more factors than one: the investments are temporary
and KDB has a firm policy of selling its shareholdings as soon as it pru-
dently can (it sold three subsidiaries in 1974); the invested companies
are effectively supervised both by KDB and the Government through SAC; com-
mercially the investment portfolio has started yielding reasonable returns
(in 1974, the yield was 7.6%), and the total investment in the subsidiaries
(other than KIL and RC) has been reduced over the years to less than 5% of
KDB's total assets (excluding guarantees). It is expected that KDB's ex-
posure in these 5 companies will be gradually reduced as KDB sells its
shareholdings. The revised Policy Statement guards against new acquisitions
in excess of 50% of the total share capital of the invested companies.
3.13      Features of equity investments.  An analysis of KDB's equity invest-
ments is given in Annex 6. All companies in which KDB has invested, except
one, belong to the public sector. In terms of amount, 85% of total invest-
ment has been made in Government projects and the remaining 15% in the
private sector. The preponderance of public sector projects in its equity
investment portfolio reflects KDBts policy of investing in large and complex
projects of national importance generally beyond the capacity of the private
sector and the fact that part of the portfolio has been transferred by the
Government to KDB. Manufacturing is the predominant sector in KDB's equity
investment portfolio, accounting for about 88% of the total. Within the



- 12 -
manufacturing sector, 52% has gone to basic metals projects such as steel
and aluminum, 39% to fertilizer and other chemical projects, 8% to machinery
manufacturing projects and the balance of 1% to miscellaneous industries.
About 80% of total equity investment is represented by four transactions of
which three were transfers from the Government. The average size of each
individual investment transaction is W 1.33 billion while average size of
total investment in each company is W 2.0 billion.
Guarantee Operations
3.14      KDB started its guarantee operations after an amendment to the KDB
Act in December 1961 which enabled it to issue repayment guarantees in domestic
currency only. In July 1968 KDB was authorized to issue repayment guarantees
to Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) against foreign currency loans. Finally, in
September 1972 KDB was authorized to issue foreign exchange guarantees
directly to foreign creditors. The risks involved in guarantees issued
directly to the foreign creditor or to KEB are identical.
3.15      KDB's guarantee operations during the 1969-1974 period are sum-
marized in Annex 9.  In the past six years ended December 31, 1974, total
guarantees issued by KDB amotuted to W 1,616.1 billion or $3.3 billion
equivalent (W 1,424.9 billion in foreign currency and W 191.2 billion in
domestic currency), while guarantees totalling W 480.4 billion ($1.0 bil-
lion equivalent) were redeemed. On the whole, total outstanding guarantees
increased by almost 650% - from W 175.4 billion as of January 1, 1969 to
W 1,311.1 billion as at December 31, 1974 of which 95% were external
repayment guarantees (those issued against foreign suppliers' credit arranged
by Korean entrepreneurs). Most of these guarantees were issued to KEB which
in turn issued its repayment guarantees to the foreign creditor (paragraph
2.10). KDB's external repayment guarantees account for about 45% of Korea's
total foreign term liabilities.
3.16      Features of outstanding guarantees.  The main features of KDB's
outstanding guarantees as of December 31, 1973 are given in Annex 6. The
major part (53.8%) of guarantees has been issued for private sector projects.
This is in contrast to KDB's other forms of assistance such as loans and
investments, of which only 33% and 14.6% respectively have gone to the
private sector. In terms of the number of guarantees, the share of the
private sector is even higher (70%). Another feature is that a major part
(61.3%) of guarantees has been issued to existing companies, whereas the major
part of loans (64.2%) has gone to new projects. This reflects KDB's policy
of giving preference to established companies in considering requests for
guarantees. Over 92% of KDB guarantees have gone to the electricity (32.3%)
and manufacturing (60.2%) sectors. In the electricity sector almost all
guarantees have been issued on behalf of one client, Korea Electric Company
(KECO), which is Korea's national power generating and distribution company,
controlled by the Government (paragraph 4.12). Within the manufacturing
sector, chemicals and petroleum (30%), fabricated metal products (22.4%),
textiles (15.3Z), basic metals (14.1%) and non-metallic mineral products (14%)
are important sub-sectors. The geographical distribution of KDB guarantees



_ 13 3
is almost identical to that of loans. Average size of guarantees issued is
W 1.0 billion. There are 147 guarantees issued in excess of W 2.0 billion
each (18.7% of total) but these represent 84.5% of the total amount guaranteed;
public sector projects (steel mills, KECO, oil refinery, fertilizer plants)
account for most of the largest guarantees,
3.17      Guarantee operations and KDB's creditworthiness.  KDB's guarantee
operations are over two and half times the size of its loan and investment
operations combined, and outstanding guarantees more than nine times its
net worth. If guarantees are included in its debt, KDB's long term debt/
equity ratio would be 11.7. Moreover, some of the guarantees issued by KDB
are very large indeed, e.g., as of June 30, 1974, the fourteen largest
guarantees represented almost 70% of total outstanding guarantees as of that
date and the range was W 11.2 billion to W 201 billion ($28 million to $500
million). Although the delinquency rate so far has been negligible, the
existing potential risk to KDB is considerable and seriously affects the
judgement of KDB's long-term creditworthiness. (Moreover, the guarantee fee
of 0.4 to 0.6% on outstanding guarantees common to all banking institutions
in Korea, appears to be unduly low.) Yet a complete elimination of KDB's
guarantee function, or even a severe curtailment of it, would not be in
the larger interests of the country. Korea needs and will long continue
to need large inflows of foreign capital and KDB is in a good position to
encourage such inflows by its guarantee function. An arrangement, satisfactory
to the Bank, has now been worked out between the Government and KDB, covering
more than 80% of total oustanding guarantee portfolio, which provides, in
brief, that if and when a default shall occur under any guarantee covered
by the arrangement, the Government shall take the necessary steps in order
to enable KDB to meet all obligations falling due under the default. The
arrangement provides further that if and when the Government and KDB reach
the conclusion that the defaulting party has become bankrupt, the Government
shall assume all future obligations of KDB under the guarantee contract.
In view of this Guarantee Release Arrangement, it is appropriate, for the
purpose of limiting KDB's borrowing powers (see paragraph 4.07), to exclude
the guarantees from the definition of debt which are covered under the
Arrangement.
Economic Impact of KDB's Operations
3.18      The economic impact of KDB's operations is examined in Annex 10,
"KDB's Role in the Economy"', and summarized in the following paragraphs.
3.19      KDB in peropective.  KDB is by far the largest long-term lending
institution in Korea accounting for 46% of all medium- and long-term loans
by the banking sector outstanding at the end of 1973. It directly financed
8% of total fixed capital formation, and 16% of total fixed investment in
the manufacturing sector, in 1973. As KDB on an average finances about 30%
- of total project cost, and if guarantees are included, KDB was involved in
close to 40% of total fixed investment in the country in 1973. Its guarantee



- 14 -
portfolio at the end of 1973 (US$1.5 billion equivalent) accounted for 38%
of Korea's total foreign medium- and long-term debt and in 1973 its clients
accounted for 41% of Korea's total exports of manufactures.
3.20      Employment and output.  In 1972, enterprises assisted by KDB
accounted for about one fourth of total industrial employment and output in
the country. As some of KDB-assisted projects are very capital-intensive
(steel mills, petrochemical plants), the average cost per job for 109 projects
completed between 1970 and 1973 was US$14,000 compared to a national average
of US$4,200 equivalent in 1972; excluding the two steel plants and three
petrochemical plants from the sample, the average cost per job would decrease
to US$4,100 equivalent. By the end of 1972, projects assisted by KDB had
created 250,000 new jobs and, in 1972, their output was valued at US$1.2
billion equivalent (25% of total industrial output in that year).
3.21      Resource mobilization.  KDB's resource mobilization effort from
sources other than the Government has been impressive. Of its total re-
sources as of December 31, 1974, almost 37% (US$479 million equivalent) were
raised independently. Funds raised independently 1/ include those raised
in the domestic capital market (51.8%), borrowings from international
institutions (12.5%) and borrowings from international capital markets (25.9%).
Early in 1974, KDB borrowed US$80 million from a consortium of foreign banks
without Government guarantee. In October 1974, KDB borrowed US$19 million
equivalent from Abu Dhabi and expects to tap the Middle East capital market
again in 1975. At the project level, KDB has been instrumental in raising
resources indirectly by persuading some of its clients to meet a higher
proportion of total project costs from their own resources than they envisaged
initially.
3.22      Economic rates of return of KDB projects.  KDB does not routinely
calculate the economic rates of return (ERR) of the projects it finances.
However, the ERRs of a sample of 28 projects were found to be very satis-
factory, averaging 30% with only four below 17%. The average ERR was higher
than the average financial rate of return (FRR) although in 3 cases the FRR
was higher than the ERR. In all cases the ERR was higher than the current
estimate of the opportunity cost of capital in Korea. The satisfactory
ERRs are not surprising because Korea's industrial development policies and
priorities have been highly successful, and by adhering to them closely
KDB has been able to finance economically good projects.
3.23      Other contributions.  KDB has been performing an important func-
tion by temporarily holding a majority interest in Government sponsored
projects, and subsequently selling the shares to private investors after
improving project performance. It has helped broaden the enterpreneurial
base in Korea by financing projects proposed by persons without previous
industrial experience. KDB also carries out, on a regular basis, statistical
surveys, conducts economic and industrial research, undertakes engineering
surveys and business analyses and provides managerial assistance to its pro-
jects. In addition, KDB has often been called upon by the Government to
1/   Funds provided by retained earnings accounted for 12.9%.



- 15 -
give its opinion on major policy issues, and it has assisted in many Govern-
ment projects and programs. KDB's management is regularly represented on
many important Government committees such as the Economic Cabinet Meeting,
the FCIDC, the Industrial Rationalization Council, the Advisory Committee
for Economic Planning and the NIF-Management Council.
Resources
3.24      As of December 31, 1974, KDB's total resources amounted to W 628.7
billion ($1.31 billion equivalent) of which W 527.4 billion ($1.1 billion
equivalent) or 83.9% were raised in domestic currency and W 101.3 billion
($208 million) or 16.1% in foreign currency. A detailed description of
KDB's resources and the main terms and conditions of borrowed funds are
given in Annexes 11, 12 and 13.
3.25      KDB's equity is its single largest source of funds.  The authorized
capital is W 300 billion. The Government's initial subscription to KDB's
paid-in capital made in 1954 was W 10 million; the present paid-in amount
is W 119.7 billion (December 31, 1974). Increases in paid-in capital since
the beginning of 1969 have been much larger (W 99.8 billion) than in the
earlier 15-year period (1954-1968). Reserves and retained earnings
amounted to W 22.9 billion as of December 31, 1974.
3.26      KDB's domestic currency borrowings can be divided into three
categories: (a) direct borrowings from the Government, (b) borrowings
from Government institutions or funds (such as NIF and IRF) and (c)
borrowings from the general public. Direct borrowings from the Government
(W 136.6 billion as of December 31, 1974 representing 26% of total domestic
resources) mainly come in the form of budgetary allocations made on the
basis of KDB's resource requirements set forth in its yearly OP (paragraph
2.17). A part of the funds lent by the Government is for specified
projects and/or sectors, while the rest is available to KDB for its normal
operational purposes. Borrowings from Government institutions and funds
(SFDs, NIF, IRF and TDF) amounted to W 118.9 billion (23% of total domestic
currency resources) as of December 31, 1974. These funds have been provided
to KDB under the Government's various plans to provide funds to specific
sectors of the economy. Borrowings from the public include IFDs and deposits
(W 120.2 billion or 23% of total domestic currency resources as of December
31, 1974) raised independently by KDB.
3.27      Until 1969 KDB was completely dependent on the Government for
its foreign currency resources. In 1970 KDB obtained its first direct
foreign currency loan ($10 million from ADB). Since then over 95% of
foreign currency resources have been obtained directly by KDB and 5%
were obtained through the Government. As a result, the proportion of
resources - in foreign as well as domestic currencies - received from the
Government declined from 71% in 1969 to 63% in 1974. The change in the
source of funds was much more pronounced during the latest 2 years period
ended December 31, 1974 when only 54% of total new resources came from the
Government and 46% were independently obtained by KDB. A statement of



- 76 -
resources received annually from the Government and raised independently
by KDB since January 1, 1969 is given in Annex 13.
3.28      In lending its foreign exchange funds, KDB does not assume foreign
exchange risk. Even when it uses its foreign exchange resources to make
loans in domestic currency and when it makes loans from "revolving funds",
KDB protects itself against the exchange risk through a "maintenance of
value" clause in its loan agreements with sub-borrowers. On loans received
from OECF and Ex-Im Bank, Japan, amounting to W 21.6 billion, KDB makes a
provision amounting to 1.5% of interest income from sub-loans to cover the
exchange risk; excess of actual losses, if any, is to be met by the Govern-
ment.
3.29      Out of total resources of W 628.7 billion, KDB's disbursements
up to December 31, 1974 had amounted to W 569.2 billion giving a net resource
availability of W 59.5 billion for further disbursements. After accounting
for KDB's undisbursed commitments (W 14.3 billion) the net resources avail-
able for further commitments amounted to W 45.2 billion as of December 31,
1974. Details of the long-term resource position as of June 30, 1974 are
given in Annex 14.
IV. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PORTFOLIO EVALUATION
Basis of Accounting
4.01      As is conventional in most other financial institutions in Korea,
KDB states income on an actual receipts basis and expenses on an accrual
basis in its annual accounts. However, financial statements for 1972 and
1973 were prepared by independent external auditors, Arthur Young & Co. (AY)
(paragraph 4.08), and are based on an accrual basis for both expenses and
income. Consequently, KDB's financial position and performance shown in
respect of 1972 and 1973 are better than was originally displayed by the
financial statements prepared by KDB itself. 1/
Financial Performance
4.02      KDB's income statements for six years ended December 31, 1974 are
summarized in Annex 15. Some highlights are given below (billion Won): 1/
1/   On the accrual basis, net income is higher by W 1.0 billion and W 0.2
billion for 1972 and 1973 respectively. Income for 1969, 1970, 1971
and 1974 is on an actual receipts basis and expenses on an accrual
basis.

4.03      In absolute terms KDB's profitability rose sharply in 1972 as a
result of record business operations in that year.  KDB's "spread" also
improved in that year as a result of a restructuring of KDB's financial
expenses and income after the promulgation of the Emergency Presidential
Decree of August 1972. The slight fall in KDB's net income in 1973
(W 3.6 billion as compared to W 3.9 billion in 1972) was caused by a negative
spread on KDB's lending operations and an increase in administrative costs
(from W 2.8 billion in 1972 to W 4.1 billion in 1973). During the past six
years, total administrative expenses increased by about 109%. Related to
total assets, however, administrative expenses declined from 2.0% in 1969
to 1% in 1974, since KDB's total assets increased by 309%.
4.04      KDB's overall profitability is low mainly because the sole
shareholder, the Government of Korea, does not regard it as primarily a
profit making institution, but as a development agency.  KDB's "spread" 1/
has always been small, ranging between a maximum of 2.8% to a minimum of
- 0.5% during the last six years. If equity funds are included, the overall
spread would be, on average, 3.5% annually for the last 6 years. KDB's
profitability has also been adversely affected in the past by a marginal
yield on its equity investments (paragraph 4.11) and the rather meager
income from its guarantee operations (paragraph 3.17).
4.05      KDB does not make provisions for bad and doubtful accounts; instead
it recognizes actual bad debts as and when they arise. During the past six
1/   Income on loan portfolio as Z of average loan portfolio minus cost

- 18 -
years, KDB wrote off debts only twice; W 1.63 million and W 64 million in
1973, and 1974 respectively. However, the external auditors, while auditing
the accounts for 1972 and 1973 independently estimated and proposed pro-
visions for doubtful debts. These provisions amounting to W 1.26 billion
for 1972 and W 1.27 billion for 1973 represented 0.53% and 0.40% of out-
standing loan portfolio as at the end of each of those years.
Financial Position
4.06      KDB's balance sheets as of December 31, 1969 through 1974 are
summarized in Annex 16, and some indicators of financial position and
operational performance are given in Annex 17. Total assets increased by
309% (51% per annum) from W 142.9 billion as of December 31, 1969 to
W 584,4 billion as of December 31, 1974. Loan portfolio (W 425.7 billion)
accounted for 73% of total assets as of December 31, 1974, while its cor-
responding share six years ago was 67%. Simultaneously, investment port-
folio as a percentage of total assets declined from 24.1% to 13.0%,
despite a 120% increase in the absolute amount of the investment portfolio.
On the resources side of the balance sheet, long-term debts increased by
348% from W 94.2 billion in 1969 to W 422.0 billion in 1974. Foreign
currency borrowings increased from W 3.4 billion to W 64.0 billion, while
their share in total long-term debts increased from 3.6% to 15%. KDB's
equity increased by 284% of which 87% was in the form of contributions
to paid-in capital and 13% in the form of increase in retained earnings.
KDB's current position is highly satisfactory with a current ratio of 3.9.
Debt/Equity Ratio
4.07      There is no statutory limit on KDB's overall debt/equity ratio,
nor does KDB's Policy Statement place any restriction on its borrowings.
The KDB Act, however, stipulates that at any time the aggregate of out-
standing amounts of IFDs and KDB guarantees shall not exceed ten times
its net worth. KDB is within this limit, the actual ratio being 9.8 as of
December 31, 1974. As of December 31, 1974 KDB's long-term debt/equity
ratio was 3.0:1. After consolidating its accounts with those of its two
permanent subsidiaries (Readjustment Corporation and Korea Industrial
Leasing Company) KDB's debt/equity ratio becomes 3.3:1. Guarantees have
been excluded from the foregoing computations of debt/equity ratio for the
reason given in paragraph 3.17. If guarantees were to be included, the
debt/equity ratio would become 11.7:1.
Audit
4.08      KDB's accounts are audited by its Government appointed internal
auditor who is a permanent member of KDB's Board of Directors, but having no
vote. KDB engaged the services of Arthur Young & Company (AY) of the United
States to audit KDB's accounts for 1973.  While preparing audited accounts
for 1973, AY also prepared for comparison purposes audited accounts for
1972. AY has given an unqualified report for both years. KDB has no



- 19 -
objection to having its accounts audited by independent qualified external
auditors satisfactory to the Bank. AY has already been appointed to audit
the accounts for 1974.
Evaluation of KDB's Portfolio
4.09      Loan portfolio.  On the whole KDB's loan portfolio is sound.  An
analysis of KDB's clients as of December 31, 1973, showed that of the 452
companies in operation (93% of total clients) 282 companies representing
63% of the loan portfolio had profitable operations in each of the past three
years, 52 companies (4.3% of the loan amount) had two profitable years in
the past three, while 80 companies (12.2% of the loan amount) had profitable
operations in at least one of the three years. Only 38 companies (8% of
total by amount) had losses in each of the past three years. The default
rate has been low and has declined further in the recent past. Total
arrears of principal and interest stood at W 18.4 billion (5.5% of total loan
portfolio) as of December 31, 1973, and have declined to W 17.1 billion 1/
(4.6% of total loan portfolio) as of June 30, 1974. The percentage of the
portfolio affected by defaults also declined from 7.6% to 4.8% during the
same period. Since January 1, 1971 there has been a noticeable improvement
in KDB's loan collections as indicated by the improvement in total collec-
tions as a percentage of total amount due in that year from 72.5% in 1971
to 91.3%, 94.6% and 97.2% in 1972, 1973 and 1974 (to June 30) respectively.
4.10      In terms of the provisions of its Operating Manual and the
"Policy Statement" KDB is required to obtain at least 125% collateral
against its loans and 120% collateral against its guarantees. However,
there is no collateral requirement for loans to and guarantees made on
behalf of Government and KDB owned and/or controlled enterprises and public
bodies. As at December 31, 1973 total loan and guarantee assistance given
to KDB and Government-owned and/or controlled enterprises and public
bodies had amounted to W 672.6 billion (loans W 237.6 billion and guarantees
W 435.0 billion). The value of collateral held by KDB against the remaininig
loans (W 80.9 billion) and guarantees (W 352.4 billion) was W 523.4 billion
or 121% of KDB's outstanding assistance. The collateral values are con-
servatively appraised, and when the Guarantee Release Arrangement (paragraph
3.17) becomes effective, the collateral coverage for KDB loans would become
very satisfactory.
4.11      Equitv investment portfolio.  While evaluating KDB's equity
investment portfolio, it should be kept in mind that KDB makes equity
investments either to promote a project considered vital for the national
economy or to acquire sufficient control over a client in difficulties to
be able to improve its management and thereby its operating results; KDB
does not make equity investments purely for profit making purposes. Against
that background the performance of KDB's investment portfolio has been
sati3factory. Total yield on investment has improved from an average of
2% during 1969 to 1972 to 5.4% in 1973 and 7.5% in 1974.  The capital gains
reported as realized are, at least notionally, inflated as in the past KDB
1/   Including the amounts transferred to Readjustment Corporation.



- 20 -
sold some of its investments on a deferred payment basis with the interest
charged on the deferred amount invariably lower than the prevalent interest
rate affecting KDB's income in future years. Such sales have, however,
become less frequent in recent years and the amounts involved have also
become much smaller. For example, in 1971 total notional loss (spread over
12 years period) was W 1.6 billion compared to W 479 million for 1972 and
W 405 million for 1973. There were three sale transactions in 1974, all for
cash payment. The performance of companies in which KDB had invested has
considerably improved during the last two years; KDB is unlikely in future
to have to resort to sale on concessional financing terms.
4.12      Investment in KECO.  KECO is Korea's national electricity genera-
ting and distribution company and has an almost monopolistic position.
ks at June 30, 1974 KDB's total investment (excluding guarantees) in KECO
amounted to W 134.5 billion (loans W 132.7 billion and equity investment
W 1.8 billion) which accounted for 37% of KDB's total outstanding loan
portfolio and 2.9% of its total equity investment portfolio. Moreover, most
loans to KECO were made by KDB at the behest of the Government. In order
to safeguard KDB against the risks of excessive exposure, an arrangement
satisfactory to the Bank has been worked out between KDB and the Government
whereby, in effect, the risks involved have been taken over by the Govern-
ment.
V. PROSPECTS
General Outlook
5.01      Because of its export oriented development strategy, the health
of Korea's economy depends heavily on world-wide economic conditions. The
slow down in the economies of Korea's major export markets, USA and especially
Japan, has already affected Korea's economic growth. At this time the
Government has not changed its long term outlook significantly although the
short-term macro economic framework is being reviewed. The basic development
strategy of reliance on the export oriented manufacturing sector is being
maintained.
5.02      The Government's industrial strategy aims especially to deepen the
industrial structure by promoting heavy and chemical industries, a move
which started in the late sixties and has gained considerable momentum since
then. Side by side with heavy industries such as steel, shipbuilding and
chemicals, light industries are also given a significant role; they are
expected to contribute substantially to the achievement of export targets.
In view of the developments of 1974 and resultant prospects of slower growth
in exports than in the past, particular emphasis is now to be placed on
increasing the domestic value added in exports. In terms of total output,
heavy and chemical industries are to increase their share from 35% in 1972
to 51% in 1981; of the total estimated investment during 1973-1981, such
industries are expected to account for about two-thirds. The vast amounts



- 21 -
(about $12.5 billion over the period) that will be necessary to achieve the
ambitious growth are to be financed increasingly by domestic savings, though
it is likely that dependence on external resources will continue to be subs-
tantial. The financial sector of the economy will be under challenge to
organize the mobilization and allocation of those funds. KDB, because of
its large size, its competent management and staff and its development oriented
policies, will play an important role in Korea's continued development.  Its
own operational strategy is likely closely to follow the overall national
industrial strategy.
Business Forecasts
5.03      KDB's operational forecasts for the period 1975-79 are given in
Annex 18. Forecast commitments are as follows (billion Won):
Domestic Foreign
Currency  Currency                                 Total
Loans     Loans   Total Loans  Investments  Commitments

1976                  151.80     39.84       191.64         15.77        207.41
1977                  162.45     33.52       195.97         17.92        213.89
1978                  173.78     41.75       215.53         19.92        235.45
1979                  185.93     42.10       228.03         21.92        249.95
5.04      Commitments for 1975 are based on KDB's Operational Program for
the year (paragraph 2.17), applications in hand for financial assistance
and those expected to be received. From 1976 onwards domestic currency loans
have been projected assuming a 7% growth rate. The projected volume of
operations is constrained by resource expectations rather than by expected
lack of demand for KDB assistance. Considering the Government's growth
targets and estimates of overall investment demand, KDB's business forecasts
are probably too conservative and should be attained unless there is an
unexpected setback in the Government's or KDB's efforts to raise resources.
5.05      The share of foreign currency loans in the total mix of loans
increased from 10% in 1973 to 15.8% in 1974 and is projected to increase to
19.4% in 1975. This reflects the perception of a change only in the pattern
of financing of imports rather than a change in the nature and composition
of projects to be financed. In the past, on an average, 27% of KDB's
domestic currency loans were used for the procurement of imported equipment
and machinery. (Foreign exchange is made available for authorized imports
by the Korean Government against equivalent payment in domestic currency.)
In view of the large demand for its domestic currency funds, KDB proposes
to use foreign currency loans to an increasing extent to finance the
import needs of its sub-projects.



- 22 -
Resource Needs
5.06      KDB makes use of some of its foreign currency resources for
financing domestic operations, and as stated in the previous paragraph,
a part of its domestic currency loans is in fact used by the borrowers
for financing imports. KDB's resource requirements for the future should
therefore be reviewed in aggregate terms (domestic and foreign resources
together). Since demand for domestic currency funds is expected to be
larger than the availability of funds from domestic sources, KDB intends
to use only its borrowings from such international institutions as KfW,
ADB and the Bank for financing foreign currency loans; funds to be raised
through borrowings from foreign commercial banks and issuance of IFDs in
foreign currency would be converted to augment the domestic currency
resources of KDB. During the two years ending December 31, 1976, KDB's total
additional commitments (loans and investments) are projected at about
W 385.7 billion. Including an investment of about W 35 billion to maintain
satisfactory liquidity (actual investment in liquid assets as of December 31,
1974 was W 31 billion), KDB's total resource needs to the end of 1976 total
W 420.7 billion. During 1975 and 1976 KDB plans to raise total resources of
W 378.4 billion as follows (billion Won):
Sources of Funds
Increase in paid-in capital               11.5
Borrowings from
Government                           59.8
NIF                                 122.2
IRF                                  11.5
Foreign commercial banks
($80 million)                  38.8 /a
Issuance of IFD (net)                66.0 /b
KfW (DM 15 million)                   3.0 /a
ADB (US$67 million)                  32.5 Ia
IBRD (US$60 million)                 29.1 7a
Total                          374.4
/a   In foreign currencies.
/b   Partly issued in foreign currency.
5.07      To the above new resources should be added the uncommitted balance
(W 45.2 billion) of resources available as of December 31, 1974 which would
give a total of W 419.6 billion - almost equal to the net requirement of the
period. The proposed Bank loan of W 29.1 billion ($60 million equivalent)
would enable KDB to complete its financing plan for 1975 and 1976. A
schedule of projected disbursement from the proposed Bank loan is given in
Annex 23.



23 -
Financial Projections
5.08      KDB's projected balance sheets as at December 31, 1975 through
1979 are given in Annex 19. In the next five years ending December 31,
1979 total assets are projected to increase at the rate of about 28% p.a.
which is slower than the actual growth rate in the recent past (see para-
graph 4.06). A relatively smaller base helped KDB achieve a high growth
rate in the past. In the next five years, total loan portfolio (net of
provision for doubtful accounts) is projected to increase by more than two
and a half times from W 425.7 billion as at December 31, 1974 to W 1,112.0
billion as of December 31, 1979. Investments, however, are projected to
increase by only about 52% since KDB plans to roll over its investments.
Total naw investments during 1975-79 are projected at W 85.1 billion while
sales are planned at W 45.2 billion. The primary objectives of this
heavy roll over of investments are (a) to reduce KDB's investment in
companies in which its present holding is more than 50% and (b) to broaden
the base of industrial ownership in Korea. Total portfolio (loans plus
investments) is projected to increase by 145% during 1975-79 period.
Reserves and provisions are estimated to increase as a percentage of total
portfolio from 4.6% at the end of 1974 to 6.4% at the end of 1979. Total
debt to equity ratio will improve from 12.3:1 in 1974 (all guarantees
included in debt) to 4.8:1 in 1979 (all guarantees covered by the Guarantee
Release Arrangement excluded from debt). KDB's long-term debt/equity ratio
is likewise projected to improve from 11.7:1 in 1974 to 3.5:1 in 1975 thoni,h
rising gradually thereafter to 4.5:1 in 1979. These ratio take into account
the expected increase in KDB's equity by at least W 85 billion later this
year.
5.09      KDB's projected income statements through 1979 are given in
Annex 20. Based on the projected business operations, net income is
expected to increase from W 4.1 billion in 1974 to W 10.5 billion in 1979.
Consistent with its usual accounting practice, KDB has made projections
of income on an actual receipt basis and of expenses on an accrual basis,
causing projected income to be somewhat understated. Interest income is
expected to contribute 84% of gross income in 1979 (78.5% in 1974). A
relatively high share of equity funds ln KDB's total capitalization assures
profitable operations, despite negative or no margin on lending from borrowed
funds. KDB's actual experience in 1974 supports this expectation (para-
graph 4.04). Net income as a percentage of equity is projected first to
increase from 2.9 in 1974 to 4.7 in 1976 and then to fall slightly to 3.3
in 1979. Considering KDB's role in the Korean economy and the fact that
it is 100% owned by the Government, which does not expect any direct return
on its investment in KDB, the estimated returns on equity are reasonable.
5.10      KDB's projected cash flows are shown in Annex 21.  The debt service
cover in future years is apparently thin for two reasons. First, the deposits
received by KDB in foreign currency which amounted to W 34.4 billion as of
December 31, 1974 are projected to be substantially (90%) repaid before the



- 24 -
end of 1976 resulting in a heavy debt servicing burden during this period, 1/
and are therefore included in the calculation of debt service coverage.
Secondly, KDB's liability to redeem IFDs is large (on an average W 27.5
billion p.a.). A significant part of KDB's resources is raised in the form
of IFDs which are of relatively short duration (average 2 years) but the
funds are used for financing both the short-term working capital loans as
well as long-term equipment loans. Heavy recurring repayments of IFDs would
not create any debt servicing problem as these would be refinanced through
issuance of new IFDs, which exceed yearly redemptions (average new issuance
of IFDs is projected at W 56.4 billion p.a.). Moreover, KDB has taken a
policy decision, with the knowledge of the Government, to issue more of
long-term debentures in foreign capital markets, rather than short-term
debentures in the domestic market. The Government has also agreed to
guarantee KDB's debentures issued in the foreign capital markets. If the
amount of IFDs refinanced annually are excluded, the debt service cover
improves to a minimum of 1.2 times in all the projected years.
Proposed Bank Loan
5.11      As stated in paragraph 5.07, a Bank loan in the amount of US$60
million is recommended to meet a part of KDB's capital requirements to the
end of 1976. The proposed loan will account for considerably less than 10%
of KDB's resource needs for the years 1975 and 1976.
5.12      The Bank could hope to achieve two main objectives through lend-
ing to KDB: (a) financing of industrial development and influencing the
course of policies affecting such development, and (b) having a constructive
influence on KDB as an institution, the Bank's traditional role of insti-
tution building. As regards the first objective, the Bank has recog-
nized that manufacturing is expected to remain the principal engine of
economic growth and employment in Korea, and has concluded that the Bank
Group could support the development of the industrial sector most effectively
through the development finance companies. The Bank has been lending to
KDFC since 1968; with the proposed loan to KDB and another proposed loan to
MIB in FY 76, the Bank will cover the entire specialized field of long-term
industrial lending in Korea. As to the Bank's institution building role,
KDB's management strongly wishes to establish a relationship with the Bank
and is receptive to new ideas. In fact the Bank has already had significant
impact on KDB's policies (a major revision of the Policy Statement) and
financial position (Guarantee Release Arrangemenit and the arrangement in
respect of its loans to KECO). KDB's appraisal techniques are also ex-
pected to improve in the future (InLroduction of the economic rate of
return analysis). Indirectly, the Bank loan may also help KDB in its
resource raising efforts in the international capital markets.
1/   These deposits were made by KEB, which now intends to withdraw them
as KDB has started to raise foreign currency funds independently
from the international money market.



- 25 -
5.13      The proceeds of the proposed loan will be used to finance direct
imports. KDB has given the Bank to understand (agreed minutes of the
negotiation) that (i) the loan proceeds will be used principally to finance
projects in the manufacturing sector although such other sectors as shipping,
mining, service industries will also be eligible, (ii) it intends to finance
projects mainly in the private sector although public sector projects will
also be eligible, (iii) in selecting projects, KDB will abide by the Govern-
ment's overall economic policies and priorities and will give preference
to export oriented projects, heavy and chemical industries, import substitu-
tion industries and to intermediate goods producing and employment creating
projects, and (iv) it will not limit the use of the proposed Bank loan to
a few very large projects (individual sub-loan amounts will not normally
exceed US$4 million each).
5.14      KDB's capital structure is sound, and given its sound portfolio,
and the competence of its management and staff, a debt/equity ratio
limit of 5:1 is recommended with "debt" defined to cover all borrowings
having a maturity of more than one year (including Government loans) and
those guarantees which will not be covered by the Guarantee Release Arrange-
ment. An initial free limit of $750,000 is recommended; with it, the Bank
could expect to receive projects requiring prior approval aggregating about
70% of the proposed loan by amount. However, since this would be the Bank's
first loan to KDB, an aggregate free limit of US$18 million (30% of the
proposed loan amount) is also recommended as a safeguard. The minimum interest
rate on subloans charged by KDB would be 2% above the Bank's lending rate,
with the exchange risk borne by the sub-borrower. Other terms and conditions
of the proposed loan will be similar to those in recent Bank loan agreements
with DFCs, including a flexible amortization schedule.

KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK
Economic, Industrial and Financial Environment
Economic Overview
1.        For a detailed review of the recent economic situation and prospects,
reference is invited to the Bank's latest economic report on Korea: Current
Economic Position and Prospects of the Republic of Korea (In Two Volumes),
February 20, 1974, 332-KO. An Economic Mission returned in February 1975
after completing the field work in Korea; its report is under preparation.
2.        In recent years, Korea's economy has shown an impressive per-
formance with its per capita income doubling over the last 10 years (1973:
US$310) and its GNP growing at 11% p.a. since 1968. The stimulus for the
rapid growth was provided by an even faster growth in the manufacturing
sector which in 1973 contributed 28% to GNP. The manufacturing sector is
now the largest sector, since the share of agriculture decreased from 28%
in 1968 to about 23% of GNP in 1973 although the annual growth rate of
agriculture, too, has been satisfactory at 3.5% p.a. Between 1968 and 1973
investment expenditure increased by 12% p.a. The single most important
factor responsible for Korea's economic growth has been the remarkable
export performance; exports increased by 34% p.a. in constant terms and
their contribution to GNP increased from 13% in 1968 to 28% in 1973.
3.        In 1973 the Korean economy surpassed its already good performance
in the past: GNP grew by 16.5%, manufacturing output by 31%, exports by
61%, and gross domestic investment by 46%. This pace of the economy was
unsustainable and strains on the economy were already developing, including
scarcities of raw materials, shortages of operating funds and inflationary
pressures (see para 23), when the energy crisis and the recessions in Korea's
major export markets (Japan and the USA) hit the economy. During the first
half of 1974, investment remained at relatively high levels, industrial
output and exports continued to increase and GNP grew at an annual rate of
about 14%. The full impact of the world wide economic slow down was felt
in the second half of 1974 as exports dropped sharply, pulling down the
rate of growth of exports for the whole year to about 7.8% only, compared
with 61% in 1973. This led to sharp cut backs in industrial output and
fixed investment, especially in export industries, while further increasing
the build up in inventories. Imports, on the other hand, which had started
earlier as a result of domestic demand contraction grew much faster than
exports, thereby considerably weakening Korea's balance of payments position.
Due to its heavy dependence on exports, an acceleration in the growth of
Korea's economy is inevitably linked to a recovery in the economies of
Korea's major export markets.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
4.        The rapid growth of the last few years required large amounts of
investment funds, and considering Korea's rather limited resource base, led
to substantial external borrowings which tripled between 1968 and 173, al-
though the domestic savings performance by itself was quite remarkable aver-
aging 17% of GNP between 1968 and 1973 (compared with 11% in the preceding
five years). The debt service burden, temporarily at 20% in 1971, Lowever,
came down to 10% in 1973 thanks to the excellent export performance.
The Industrial Sector
5.        Recent developments.  Over the last six years, manufacturing was
the fastest growing sector in Korea's economy with an annual growth rate of
20%. Its share in GDP increased from 20% in 1968 to 28% in 1973 ann during
the same period it accounted for 42% of the growth of GNP. Investments in
manufacturing remained stable in constant terms between 1968 and 19`2 but in
1973 jumped by 85% to US$700 million equivalent, accounting for 26% of total
fixed capital formation in 1973 and for 7% of GNP. In 1974 fixed ir:vestment
in manufacturing increased in nominal terms to about US$730 million but
dropped in real terms by nearly 18% and its share in total fixed capital
formation dropped to 18%.  A feature of the development of manufacturing
industries is the fact that between 1968 and 1972 the average capitU.1
output ratio was a low 1.4 despite the investments in such large capital
intensive projects as Korea's first steel plant and a naphta crackirg
plant. It was the result of balanced growth with substantial investment in
such labor intensive sub-sectors as textiles, wearing apparel, leather and
electronics also taking place simultaneously.
6.        The rapid expansion of manufacturing output was based mair.ly on an
even faster growth of manufactured exports; these increased at a rate of
about 50% p.a. over the last five years. Exports of manufactures ar.ounted
to more than $4.0 billion and accounted for about 90% of total expolts in
1974 (1968: 74%) and about 30% of total manufacturing output in that year
(1968: 11%). The two largest markets for Korean exports of manufac;tures
are the USA and Japan, which together account for almost 75% of total
exports. The risks of high market concentration were demonstrated during
1974; Korea's Government is now making vigorous efforts to diversify- exports
to other markets, including Africa, Middle East and South America.
7.        Statistics for the first 10 months of 1974 show that growth in
manufacturing output slowed considerably after the middle of the year,
especially in Korea's traditional export sectors like textiles, wearing
apparel and wood products processing industries. This is a reflection of
the drastic drop in total exports which, in real terms, in the last quarter
of 1974, were even below the corresponding levels of 1973. Since real
domestic consumption demand also declined due to substantial price 'ncreases



ANNEX 1
Page 3
and fixed investment was down (for instance, building construction permits
in the second half of 1974 were about 50% down from levels reached in the
same period of 1973), producers' inventories increased by almost 60% during
1974.
8.        Structure of industry.  Measured in terms of value added in 1973,
light manufactures accounted for almost two thirds of total industrial value
added. The growth performance of the sub-sectors varied but was very good
throughout as the following table shows (amounts in billion Won)s

Textiles, footwear and leather is the largest sub-sector accounting for slightly
more than one fifth of total industrial output in 1973. The impetus for
growth of this sub-sector was provided by export sales. In 1968, exports



ANNEX 1
Page 4
accounted for 28% of total output of this sector; by 1973 this parcentage had
increased to 64%. Over the last five years there has been no si;nificant
shift from light to heavy manufactures though between 1972 and 1)73 heavy
manufactures increased its share in total value added from 29.8% to 33.2%.
With the recent government emphasis on promoting heavy and chemical industries
(see paragraph 13) envisaging total fixed investments in heavy manufactures
of about $6.9 billion equivalent by 1981, the share of this sector is
expected to increase to about 45% by 1981.
9.        Of a total of 23,729 industrial enterprises in Korea ii 1972, 1/
96.5% employed less than 200 workers each. However, in terms of employment
and value added, such enterprises accounted for only 45% and 28% of the
total, respectively. Despite adequate promotional policies and availability
of industrial finance, the relative importance of small- and medLum-sized
enterprises in the total industrial structure has been declining, In 1972
large enterprises accounted for 78% of total fixed investment while it was
only 69% in 1968. Large enterprises' share in total value added (from 64
to 72%) and total employment (from 46 to 55%) has also increased since 1968.
This trend will most likely continue since the Government's long-term
policies aim at deepening the industrial structure by establishilg heavy
and chemical industries with optimum capacities (see paragraph 11).
10.       Geographically, industrial enterprises are concentrated in Seoul
and Bussan provinces where 50% of all enterprises are located, a-counting
for 71%, 74% and 63% of total employment, value added and new gross fixed
investment respectively in 1972. Industrial employment in these two
provinces accounted for 85% of the additional 225,000 jobs created in
Korea's industrial sector between 1968 and 1972. However, the Government
is placing increasing emphasis on a wider geographic distributioa, has sup-
ported the establishment of growth centers in other provinces, anid as a
result greater industrial dispersion can be expected over a period of time.
11.       The financing pattern of industrial enterprises has considerably
improved in recent years. In 1971, return on total capitalizatiin of
all industrial enterprises was a low 0.5% and enterprises were ii general
undercapitalized showing an average debt equity ratio of 4.2.  The debt/
equity ratio improved considerably by 1973 (2.6) mainly because of sig-
nificantly higher profitability (6.9%). The improvement in profits in 1972
and 1973 was a result of many factors such as continuing brisk demand, a
lag in wage increases behind productivity increases, continuing improvement
in capacity utilization and also the August 3, 1972 measures,tha:, among
others, substituted high cost short-term debts by low cost long-term debt.
In 1974, however, companies again came under considerable financial strain
as demand slackened, inventories piled up and costs continued to rise.
In 1973, of the total industrial investment for fixed assets amounting to
about $700 million equivalent, about 40% was in equity funds and the balance
1/   Figures in this and the next paragraph are based on the manlIfacturing
census, 1972. The census does not define "small", medium and "large"
enterprises but the MIB Act defines "large"' enterprises as those employ-
ing 200 workers or more (see paragraph 18).

in borrowed funds. Of the equity funds, about 60% was in the form of re-
tained earnings and the balance in the form of new share capital, divided
about equally between domestic and direct foreign investment. Of the
total debt capital, external sources accounted for about 35%.
12.       Industrial strategy.  The economic slump that developed in 1974
prompted the Government to take a series of short-term measures to ease the
burden for a number of industries that faced serious liquidity problems.
The generally tight financial policies in effect in the first half of the
year were relaxed, credits for imported and domestic industrial raw
materials were increased, and programs to purchase excess inventories
and to make available special credits to small businesses were begun or
expanded. The devaluation of the Won by 17.5% in December 1974 is also
expected to help export oriented manufacturing enterprises. To stimulate
private investment, the Government has increased public sector outlays
over originally planned levels.
13.       The Government's long term industrial strategy has been based on
vigorous promotion of the export sector. The strategy has proved highly
successful and has resulted in remarkable progress of the economy as a whole.
As a logical evolution of this strategy, emphasis shifted in the late
sixties and early seventies to strengthening and deepening the industrial
structure by promoting heavy and chemical industries. In view of the devel-
opments of 1974 and resultant prospects of slower growth in exports than
in the past, particular emphasis is now to be placed on increasing the
domestic value added in exports. The investment requirements will be Large
and therefore a major effort has been luanched to increase domestic savings.
The vehicle for vastly increased domestic savings is going to be the
National Investment Fund (NIF) whichi was set up when the NIF Law was promul-
gated on December 14, 1973. The Minister of Finance is in charge of the-
Fund but in effect delegates its management and operation to the Governor
of the Bank of Korea.  Before the present economic down turn developed, the
NIF was estimated to account, by 1981, for about 75% of total investment.
needs of major industries, amounting to W 6,100 billion (US$12,600 million).
The resources of the Fund will be mobilized mainly (about three-fourth) bv
issuance of NIF--Bonds and the remainder by direct subscription by the
Government. NIF-Bonds will be bought by various savings institutions
including banks and insurance companies and by private investors. The
funds will be on-lent through the banking system for investments in fixed
assets (about two-thirds) and for working capital needs of major industries.
Banks will be charged 10.5% p.a. and allowed a spread of 1,.5% so that
borrowers will pay 12% p.a.
14.       In order to promote industrial development in general and to
direct industrial investment to particular sectors, the Government pro-
vides various incentives, the package of which includes reductions in
corporate, business and income tax rates, easy access to credit, prefer-
ential interest rates, depreciation and other allowances and protection

through tariffs. Incentives are also extended to attract foreign invest-
ment, encourage public ownership of closely held companies and to promote
decentralization of industries. Besides these incentives, a number of
other measures aim solely at the small-medium scale industrial sector. A
summary of incentives for various industrial sectors is given in Annex 1A.
Incentives for exports of manufactures are estimated to amount to about
W 87 per Dollar of exports in 1970 with an estimated effective rate of
subsidy of 9-12% on total exports of manufactures. As for tariffs, a
recent study 1/ suggests that effective protection in domestic manufacturing
sales was negative in 1968. Since 1968 the tariff structure has not changed
substantially and, therefore, it can be assumed that effective protection
has continued to be negative or, at the most, very low. Total receipts
from custom duties as a percentage of total imports amounted to a low 4.7%
in 1973.
Financial Environment
15.       Institutional arrangement.  The financial sector of Korea con-
sists of the Bank of Korea, Deposit Money Banks and non-monetary financial
institutions (see paragraph 15). The Bank of Korea performs regular cen-
tral banking functions, including the supervision of commercial banks.
Deposit Money Banks are either commercial banks or specialized banks.
Commercial banks are characterized by receiving their funds mainly through
deposits from the public. They can make all kinds of loans; however,
they have traditionally concentrated on short-term lending. Recently
they have increased long-term lending business, and roll over of short-
term loans is also common. Most commercial banks have their majority
shares held by the Government. All commercial banks are subject to con-
trol and supervision by the Bank of Korea. Specialized Banks in contrast
are directly controlled by the Ministry of Finance. They were all es-
tablished under a Special Banking Act and only a few specific Articles
of the Bank of Korea Act and General Banking Act apply. Specialized
Banks, as their names imply, were founded for particular purposes/sectors
(such as small-scale industry financing, agricultural financing) and
their major source of funds are loans, mostly from the Government.
16.       There are 5 nationwide commercial banks, ten banks with localized
operations, eight branches of foreign banks and the Korea Trust Bank, which
have all together 511 branches/offices around the country (all these fall
under the term of commercial banks). Specialized Banks include the Korea
Exchange Bank, which in 1967 was established mainly to relieve the Bank of
Korea of commercial foreign exchange business, the Medium Industry Bank
(see paragraph 18), the Citizens National Bank (mainly for mobilizing small
savings and financing household loans), the Korea Housing Bank, the National
Agricultural Cooperative Fund (NACF) and the Fisheries Cooperative.
17.       Besides the above-mentioned banking institutions (Monetary System)
there are several non-monetary financial institutions, namely KDB, trust
accounts of commercial banks, six life insurance companies and postal savings
system. Other non-banking financial institutions (not covered in Korea's
monetary and banking statistics) performing specialized functions are the

(in draft).

Korean Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) which specializes in providing
medium- and long-term capital mainly to industrial and transportation sectors
(accounts for about 7% of the banking sector's total equipment loans outstand-
ing to industry), the Korean Investment Corporation (KIC), primarily a broker
for the offering and distribution of corporate securities, the Korea Investment
and Finance Corporation (KIFC) which provides short-term finance to the private
industrial sector (in 1973 its market share in notes discounted outstanding
was 24% of the total of W 66 billion) and which also started operating in
the capital market (in 1973 KIFC underwrote three corporate debentures of
W 950 million), eight other recently established short-term finance corpora-
tions and the Korea Capital Corporation, all of whicth deal in short-term
money market instruments. In addition, there were 290 mutual savings and
finance companies at the end of 1973 and some 1300 authorized credit unions.
KDFC was established in 1968 with active support of the World Bank Group;
IFC holds 14.3% of its share capital. KIFC is a subsidiary of KDFC, and
IFC was one of its sponsors and holds 20% of its share capital.
18.       As of October 31, 1974, total loans outstanding to industry
by all banking institutions in Korea amounted to almost W 1,500 billion
($`.1 billion equivalent), three fourth of which was for operating funds,
mainly supplied by commercial banks. The largest supplier of equip-
ment fund loans was KDB which, as of October 31, 1974, had an out-
standing portfolio of W 95 billion (about $200 million) or about 40%
of total outstanding medium- and long-term credit by banking institu-
tions to industry as of that date.
19.       Financing for small-scale industrial sector.  The Medium
Industry Bank was founded in 1961 as a Government owned and controlled
institution to extend financial and technical assistance to small and
medium industries. 1/ Its lending is restricted to companies withi fixed
assets below W 600 million or those with less than 200 employees. It stops
lending to those clients that outgrow these limits. Besides its lending
operations, it is involved in export financing, credit guarantee operations,
international banking, extension services and research of small-medium
industries. As of December 31, 1974 MIB's total resources amounted to
W 189 billion including loans from AID, ADB 2/ and KfW. As of the same
date, it had total outstanding loans amounting to W 157 billion of which
W 59 billion or 38% were term loans. About 92% of total loans are to
the manufacturing sector. Small-scale industries can also, and do, obtain
funds from commercial banks. 3/
1/   A detailed study on small-scale industry financing is cantained in an
annex to Financing Small Scale Industry (RPO 277) (in draft).
2!j   A new loan of $30 million has been made by ADB in 1974.

20.       Capital Market.  The Korea Stock Market which was moribund
for many years showed signs of life in 1972. Before then the yields on
stocks were unattractive as both commercial banks and the "curb market"
paid high interest rates. The market was also thin because closely held
companies were reluctant to go public. With the economic boom that got
under way from about mid-1972 and with additional measures (see also Annex
1A), the public showed growing interest in the stock market. The curb market
was severely checked as a result of August 3, 1972 measures and with de-
creasing interest rates at commercial banks, yields on stocks became
attractive. In addition, the overall investment climate became very
favourable after August 1972 and there was a campaign for more stock listings
and for companies to go public. The result was a great increase in stock
exchange activity in the second half of 1972 and in 1973, as the following
table shows (figures are as of the end of each period):
No. of      No. of       No. of         Capital of    Market Value

21.       The capital market continued to grow and strengthen during the first
half of 1974 as a result of favourable Government policies. However,the stock
prices have dropped in recent months after record highs in 1973, following the
economic slow down and unfavourable international developments. The number
of shareholders fell considerably, mainly because of withdrawal of small
investors. Over the years the ownership structure has broadened, though
at December 31, 1973, two thirds of all shareholders still held less than
100 shares each, accounting for only 1% of all shares outstanding, while less
than 1% of all shareholders owned about 70%. The importance of the Govern-
ment as a shareholder of industrial companies also decreased. While in 1970,
the Government (including public bodies) held about 39% of all listed stocks,
its holding declined to 20% of the total by the end of 1973. Also, the pro-
portion held by banking institutions decreased from 15% to 8%.
Interest Rates. Inflation
22.       Interest rates in Korea are controlled by the Government through
the Monetary Board and apply to all banking institutions. Specialized
financial institutions such as KDFC or the short-term finance companies are
not legally bound; however, in practice they, too, have to follow government
policies. At present, deposit rates range between 1% p.a. (for demand de-
posits), and 15% p.a. (time deposits). Although not directly comparable,



ANNEX 1
Page 9
it may be mentioned that public debentures yield about 21% p.a. and the
average dividend yield on common stock was 13.6% as of June 30, 1974.
General lending rates for loans stand at 15.5% irrespective of duration. 1/
Preferential rates are granted for various sectors or types of loans such
as loans for exports (9%), equipment loans for machine industry production
(10%), loans for equipment to export industries (12%) and loans made from
proceeds of the National Investment Fund (at 12%). Rates in the curb market,
which has reportedly become alive again could be as high as 35% p.a. Rates
on foreign exchange loans made by KDB, MIB and KDFC are usually at 9-10.5%
with the exchange risk borne by the borrower.
23.       The development of Korea's interest rate structure has, since about
1968, seen a continuous reduction in both deposit and lending rates. In
prescribing preferential rates for various industrial sectors, the Govern-
ment's financial aims were to strengthen the competitive position of Korea's
export industries and to give all possible support to those industries that
figure heavily in its long range development plans. The lowering of the
rates coincided, in general, with the Government's gradual success in
bringing inflation down until late 1973 when the inflation rate jumped up
again. 2/ With the emergence of the oil crisis and the general world-wide
inflation, Korea's price structure was particularly hard-hit because of its
high foreign trade dependence. Between November 1973 and April 1974 wholesale
prices shot up by 36%. Since then domestic inflation has slowed somewhat
reflecting seasonal factors, slower increase in prices for imported goods
and the dampening effect of demand contraction and rising inventories.
For the whole year of 1974, wholesale prices rose by 44.6%. In view of the
overall weakness of the economy and its expectation to succeed in bringing
inflation under control, the Government has not changed the interest rate
structure significantly. However, on December-9, 1974, preferential rates
for loans from the NIF and the Industrial Rationalization Fund were increased
from 9% and 8% respectively to 12% for both, and the rates on time deposits
for over three months (12%) and over six months (13.2%) were temporarily3/
raised to 15%.
24.       KDB's interest rates.  KDB's interest rate structure is complex
due to its many sources of funds and is further complicated by a number of
priority industries that the Government subsidizes with lower interest rates
(see Annex 1A). The rates at present range from 7.5% for Special Fund Loans
to 15.5% for loans made from its general operating funds and 14% or 15%
(plus exchange risk) for foreign revolving loan funds. Loans at the lower
1/ The lowering of medium-term rates to the level of short-term loans in
1973 was to encourage equipment investment.
2/   Inflation rates between May 1972 and November 1973, when the impact
of the oil crisis could first be felt, grew at only 7.1% p.a. (June
1972 - July 1973: 4.9% p.a.).

end of the scale are extended for projects that are selected by the Govern-
ment as priority projects or fall within the framework of general govern-
ment policy (such as loans to heavy and chemical industry). Loans at 15%
or 15.5% are mostly for working capital loans (only 1.6% of all equipment
fund loans in KDB's portfolio pay 15% or more). Loans funded from foreign
loans carry interest rates from 9% (KfW) to 10% (AID); the exchange risk,
however, is borne by the customer. Also loans made from revolving funds (at
14% p.a. for equipment fund or 15% p.a. for working capital loans) carry the
foreign exchange risk via a value maintenance clause. Borrowers of funds
from the recent $80 million loan from an international banking consortium
are charged the Euro-Dollar rate plus 1% margin and the borrowers also assume
the exchange risk whether the loan is made in foreign currencies or in Won
(in the latter case, via a maintenance of value clause). A complete list
of interest rates charged by KDB and prevalent in the country is given in
Annexes 1B and 1C.

Government Incentives to Industry
1.        In Korea's industrial development, Government incentives have
played an important roLe. These incentives are provided in many ways
among which the most important are tax concessions, exemptions from import
duties, easy access to credit, preferential interest rates, liberal deprecia-
tion and other allowances, protection through tariffs and establishment of
industrial estates, and more generally provision of dependable infrastructure.
Below is presented a summary of incentives that are given to industrial
enterprises for various purposes.
2.        Export industries.  Since about 1964, Government has increasingly
encouraged the establishment of export industries though in the recent
past the subsidies have been reduced. Major forms of incentives are:
tax concessions:  full exemption from business and commodity
taxes; exemption from real property anuisition tax, registra-
tion tax and property tax on real estate located in the Export
Industrial Estates; special depreciation allowance for business
assets used for manufacturing export goods; granting of allow-
ances for overseas market development and for export loss (1%
of foreign exchange earnings each), granting of reserve for
overseas investment loss (10% of investment amount);
reduction or exemption from import duties:  full exemption of
import duties on imports of raw materials to be used in export
industries or industries that supply export industries; imiport
duties on machinery for export industries may be paid in install-
ments over three years (before January 14, 1974, these imports
were exemnt from duty);
preferential interest rates:  loans for equipment of export
industries: 12% p.a.; loans for exports: 9% p.a. (before
January 24, 1974: 7%);
easy access to credit:  automatic availability of loans fol
financing the production of export goods;
preferential access for successful exporters to imports financed
with long term trade credits;
lower requirements on advance import deposits for raw materials
for stockpiling and on a D/A or D/P basis used in export
production;



ANNEX 1A
Page 2
--   in certain instances, automatic access to banned imports when
used for export production; easier access to restricted imports
for general use for those with good export performance;
--   wastage allowances on imported materials for export processing
that are often liighly liberal;
3.        Key industries. 1/  --  tax concessions:  exemption from commodity
tax, electricity and gas tax, granting of 6% of investment credit,
granting of special depreciation (20% generally for equipment
used in mining and manufacturing and 60-80% for 59 qualified
industries);
--   reduction or exemption from import duties for buildings, machinery
and their parts to be used in Key industries (this tariff priv-
ilege will be phased out by 1980);
--   preferential interest rates:  loans for machine industry pro-
motion: 10% (equipment loans) and 12% (working capital loans);
for major industries: 10% (equipment loans); NIF loans: 9%.
--   easy access to credit.
4.        Direct foreign investment.  Under the Foreign Capital Inducement
Law of 1966, the Government offers generous incentives for direct foreign
equity investment. Direct foreign investment has to be approved by the
Ministry of Economic Planning Board and is usually restricted to 50% of
total capital though majority foreign shareholding is possible 2/ if
(a) production is entirely for export in industrial lines in which such
investment is generally allowed in other countries and (b) in industries
which are relatively new in Korea and which would otherwise involve con-
siderable time to find a Korean partner; in this case, however, stocks
have to be gradually transferred to Korean nationals (up to 30% within
first three years and up to 50% within first five years). Foreign invest-
ment cannot exceed 50% in purely labor intensive industries, bonded pro-
cessing industries or industries using important raw materials produced
in Korea.
1/   ship building, iron and steel, fertilizer, power generation, chemical
fibre, automobile parts, machine industry, chemical pulp, mining, marine
and agricultural products processing, national land development and
construction projects, petrochemical industries, electronics, business
utilizing a result of a technical innovation, exploration of natural
resources in sea bed ancd sub-soil.
2/   At December 31, 1972, 41% of all foreign invested enterprises had foreigrn
majority ownership.



ANNEX IA
Page 3
5.        Direct investment lhas increasinlyv been directed to export industries
and i- 1973 close to 95% of all approved projects were for total export pro-
ducticn (1971:  55%.). The following, incentives are granted to foreign
ecuit- investors:
tax concessions:  exemption for five years in proportion to
the ratio of stocks owned bv tlhe foreign investors and 50%
reduction for the following three years from corporation tax,
income tax on unincorporated enterprises, dividend income,
tax on technology income, property tax and property aquisition
tax. Full exemption is also granted for wages and salary
income tax on foreign employees;
guarantee for remittance of dividend and repatriation:
unlimitted remittance of profit dividends is guaranteed after
twqo years from start of business;
reinvestment of profits is permitted tnder law up to original
investment; amount exceedins- that limit has to be approved
byv PB;
property guarantee against requisition or expropriation:  Tihe
same riglhts, privileges andt protection enjoyed bv Korean
nationals are extended to foreign individuals or enterprises.
6.        Wider geographical distribution of industries.  The Government
has encouraged the decentralization of indtustries under the rExport Industries
Compound Law, Rural Industrial Development Law and the Law for the Establish-
ment of Free Export Zones. Under these Laws, the Ministry of Construction,
Local Government and the Free Export Zones Authorities have establislhed
Export Industries Estates, other Industrial Estates and two Free Export Zones
(1Masan and Iri, the latter one to be completed by the end of 1974). Export
Industries Estates, mostly for medium-sized firms, offer services to manu-
facturing companies that have export prospects of above US$250,000/year,
with high ratios of foreign exchange earnings, advanced manufacturing
techniques and labor intensive production methods. All relevant incentives
listed in para 2 (Export industries) apply to Export Industries Estates or
Free export Zones.  In addition tlhe following, incentives are granted:
tax Incentives:  for l.ocal indutlstriaL Fstates exemption from
corporation tax for first five vears and(I reduction to 50% for
ensuin5 three years; depreciation allowance of 20%; exemption
from property tax, aquisition tax and reg,istration tax; com-
panies that move from large cities to rural areas other than
Ln(lustrial estates receive a re(duction of 6% of corporate
income tax for the first vear;

--   suprorting and related facilities such as transportation,
-ac:ing, road network, repair and maintenance of machines
and tools, power and water; in some cases provision of port
.acilities; possibility of leasing plant buildings; communica-
tion svstems; banks; customs offices, etc.;
--   in Free Export Zones, administrative procedures concerning
foreign investment, joint ventures, approval of occupancy and
construction of plant are simplified by the Administrator of
the Zone; labor disputes occurring within the Zone are mediated
under the regulations concerning public utilities in the Labor
Dispute Mediation Law for the special protection of the occupant
enterprises.
7.        Enterprises listed on the Stock Mlarket.  Since 1968, the Govern-
ment has encouraged wider public ownership of companies.  At that time the
Corporate Income Tax Law was revised giving various incentives to public
corporations.  Investment in real estate was discouraged at that time
with the passing of the Real Estate Speculative Investment Law and with
the Capital ITarket Development Promotion Law, under which the Korean Invest-
ment Corporation was established, underwriting of securities was to be
promoted and undue fluctuations in stock prices to be prevented. Subsequently,
new metlhods of stock trading were introduced to remove speculative elements
in stock transactions. In 1970, the Registration of Public and Corporate
Bonds Law was passed to simplify procedures of issuing public and corporate
bonds.  In the same year measures were introduced to facilitate public sales
of stocks by private companies which  had received foreign loans with Govern-
ment repavment -uarantees.  In 1972, the Government introduced the Public
Corporation Inducement Law which aimed at increasing the supply of quality
stocks on the Seoul Stock Exchange. As a consequence of this Law the Govern-
ment has nlow the authority to designate enterprises wh-Iicii nust go public.
The recent IIF Law also provides this feature as companies that receive funds
from NIF ;lay be designated by the 'inister of Finance to go public.

9.         Small- and Medium-Scale Industries. 1/  Promotion of small- and
medium-scale industries 2/ for all practical purposes started in 1961 with
the establishment of the Small- and 'tedium-Scale Industry Division within
the 'linistry of Commerce and Industry which was made responsible for
formulating and coordinating development policies for small- and medium-
scale industries.  At the same time the Government set up the NIB wlhichi
it uses to channel funds to the small- and medium-scale industrial sector..
At the end of 1961, the Small ancl MIedium Industry Cooperative Act was
passed to promote joint activities of small- and medium-sized industries
and thus to help improve their competitive position vis-a-vis large enter-
prises. In 1964 the Government started to set up industrial estates to
foster small industries as export industries and to dispurse small and
medium enterprises to rural areas. M1ajor incentives for small- and medium-
scale industries are:
--   preferential interest rates on MIB lending of Government
or foreign funds (12% and 8% p.a. respectively);
--   easy access to credit:  through MIB and commercial banks
(they are required to extend at least 30% of their loans to
small and medium industries) and the Citizen's National Bank
(mainly for small clients, lending limit $25,000 equivalent);
Credit Guarantee Scheme:  credit guarantees may be issued by
banks on any loan to a small enterprise withi limits of Won 20

KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK
PLolicy Statement -
Economic Role of KDB
1.        The KDB shall assist in the economic development of Korea in con-
formity with its purposes as stated in the Korea Development Bank Act (KDB
Act) enacted 30 December 1953, as amended, its By-Laws enacted 16 February
1954, as amended, and the other regulations governing its operations.
Operations
2.        The KDB will carry out its operations in accordance with sound
management and banking principles and practices. It shall endeavour to
specialize in extending capital funds to such'industries as are designated
by the Government's economic plans or decrees as priority industries as
well as other major basic industries which form the sub-structure of the
economy. KDB may also make equity investments, provide working capital
loans and render managerial and technical assistance to its Borrowers when
the need arises. KDB will also extend guarantees on behalf of client en-
terprises. KDB, however, will not compete with other financial institutions
in lending and administering industrial funds to assist major industries.
Project Selection
3.        It will finance enterprises which are soundly managed and which
appear, on careful economic, financial and engineering investigation to be
viable. Following sound banking practices, the projects will be analyzed
taking the following factors into consideration before making a commitment
of financial assistance: (a) national economic benefits; (b) technical
feasibility; (c) financial soundness and profitability; (d) marketability;
and (e) quality of management.
Criteria for Selection of Borrowers
4.        In its operations, preference will be given to the following major
industries:
(a)  Generation, transmission and supply of
electricity;
(b)  Coal-mining;
(c)  Ship-building;
(d)  Iron and steel manufacturing;
1/   Revised; to be adopted as a condition of effectiveness.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
(e) Electronics;
(f) Export industries, designated by the Government
to produce export commodities;
(g) Import-substitution industries and industries
producing raw materials necessary for export
and import-substitution;
(h) Indigenous industries and labor intensive
industries; and
(i) Such other industries as may be designated by
the Government's economic plans or decrees as
priority industries.
Qualifications for Eligible Borrowers
5.        Eligible borrowers for KDB financing must meet the following qual-
ifications:
(a) Borrowers must be financially sound;
(b) Borrowers must possess management and technical
capacity for implementing the projects being
financed;
(c) Borrowers should not have defaulted on any of
their outstanding obligations to the KDB.
Maximum Investment and Assistance
6.   (a)  KDB shall not subscribe to and/or underwrite stocks
(including investment certificates) if the paid-up
amount of the stocks so held by KDB will exceed
KDB's own paid-up capital;
(b)  KDB shall not normally make equity investments in
any single enterprise in excess of either:
(i) fifteen percent (15%) of the total unim-
paired paid-up capital, surplus, and free

unimpaired paid-up capital, surplus and

(ii) sixty-five percent (65%) of the total
assets of the enterprise.
Foreign Exchange Risk
7.        As a general policy, KDB shall cover itself adequately against
foreign exchange risks in the conduct of its operations. However, in
using "revolving funds" generated in the case of some foreign borrowings,
KDB may assume the exchange risk temporarily. Also in using some funds
provided under the Industrial Rationalization Fund Scheme, KDB may be
exposed to the exchange risk. To cover the risk in the latter case, KDB
will make provision amounting to 1.5% of such funds outstanding from time
to time.  Exchange losses exceeding the provision made by KDB, will be re-
imbursed by the Government.
Security Arrangements
8.   (a)  In accordance with normal business practices,
KDB will obtain adequate security for its loans
and guarantees. In extending a loan to an enter-
prise, KDB shall require such enterprise to provide
security the value of which shall be not less than
125% of the amount of the loan. In the case of
guarantees covered by a Government counter-guarantee
the value of security shall be not less than the
amount guaranteed, and in all other cases of guaran-
tees, shall be not less than 120% of the principal
amount covered under such guarantees.

cases where the credit or thie guarantee is extended
in favor of those enterprises enumerated in para-
graph 2, Article 10 of the Operating Manuals of KDB
as of tne date of this Policy Statement, provided,
however, that in such cases KDB will endeavor to
secure a guarantee or counter-guarantee from the

the credit or guarantee granted.

tion of its sub-borrowers and will, whenever necessary, ,promptly make avail-
able to them constructive and remedial advice on the operation of the project.
When considered necessary, KDB will also dispatch its own staff to the proj-
ect companies.
Management and Organization
10.       To build and strengthen its own management and staff as well as
to assist clients in the formulation and execution of their projects, KDB
will maintain an effective organization and an adequate staff, including
financial and economic analysis, engineering, accountancy, marketing and
legal services.
Share-Holding Fund
11.       KDB shall administer the Share-holding Administration Fund (the
Fund) pursuant to the provisions of the KDB Share-holding Act (Act No. 2128,
enacted 4 August 1969) as a separate and distinct account in KDB's official
books, the Fund will be treated as segregated from the other transactions
and resources of KDB in accordance with the provisions of said Act.
Financial Policies
12.       KDB shall conduct its operations according to the provisions of
the KDB Act. It shall endeavor to match the maturity of its liabilities
with those of its assets. It will continually review the charges it levies
for the financial assistance it provides to ensure that it receives an ade-
quate "spread" to cover all its expenses including provisions for doubtful
loans and investments, and to enable it to build reserves as required legally
and as considered necessary by the management.

KOREA DEVELOPtENT BANK
Brief Description of Readjustment Corporation and Korea
Industrial Leasing Company, Ltd.
Readjustment Corporation (RC)
1.        Readjustment Corporation (RC) was set up in February 1962 by
a Cabinet Decree as a wholly owned subsidiary of KDB. The basic objectives
and functions of RC are (a) to protect and collect claims transferred to
it by KDB and other banking institutions in the country and (b) to manage
and dispose of properties taken over and those transferred to it by KDB,
which had been acquired by KDB as a result of foreclosures. About two-
third of the accounts handled by RC have emanated from KDB and the remaining
one-third from other banking institutions. RC collects claims through
foreclosure proceedings and disposal of debtors' properties. It invariably
participates in the biddings, and properties so acquired are subsequently
sold at an appropriate time when such sales can fetch best prices. The
amounts collected by RC through purchase of properties and this subsequent
sales are applied first towards settlement of KDB claims and the balance,
if any, is retained by RC. In case of collections directly through fore-
closures, the excess of KDB's and RC's claims is refundable to the sub-
borrower. KDB's claim consists of the capital amount plus interest accrued
up to the time the particular account was transferred to RC. Interest
accrued after the date of transfer of account to RC goes to RC and con-
stitutes its income. The same principles governs conduct of RC's business
relations with other banking institutions.
2.        RC's total paid-in capital is W 565 million, all of which was
contributed by KDB in the form of transfer of its claims (W 485 million)
and properties (W 80 million). Since its inception up to June 30, 1974),
KDB transferred its claims (including those as its contribution to RC's
paid-in capital) aggregating W 30.1 billion of which claims in an amount of
W 13.3 billion liave been settled (up to June 30, 1974). Out of the unset-
tled amount of W 16.8 billion, RC had settled/sold claims/properties
amounting to W 10.4 billion (including a write-off of W 5.7 billion) and was
in the process of collecting the proceeds. Against the balance amount
(W 6.4 billion) RC was holding 140% collateral. RC's financial performance
up to 1972 was marginal (average income during 1968 to 1972 was W 44 million
or 5.3% of average network) but it considerably improved in FY73. RC's
net income in the first nine months ended September 30, 1973 was W 400
million or 35% of average net worth. In terms of its Charter (Cabinet Decree)
entire income of RC is transferred to reserves.
3.        RC is managed by a Board of Directors comprising a President,
three Directors and two auditors including one full time auditor. The



ANNEX 8
Page 2
President as well as other members of the Board of Directors are appointed,
on the recommendation of the Governor of KDB, by the Minister of Finance
who supervises, again through the Governor of KDB, RC's overall operations.
Korea Industrial Leasing Company Limited (KIL)
4.        KIL was incorporated in December 1972 as a wholly owned sub-
sidiary of KDB. Its major functions are leasing and buying and selling of
industrial machinery and equipment and other facilities, real estates and
patents, etc. KIL is managed by a Board of Directors (one president, one
directors and one auditor) who in terms of its by-laws are elected by the
shareholders (they have all been appointed by KDB so far).
5.        KIL's original paid-in capital was W 500 million all subscribed
by KDB. In early 1974 the Government of Korea promulgated a Leasing Act
which required all leasing companies to have a minimum paid in capital of
W 1.5 billion. KDB therefore contributed an additional sum of W 1.0 bil-
lion towards KIL's paid in capital raising it to W 1.5 billion. In addition
KDB has advanced a long-term loan of W 850 million to KIL. Plans are under-
way to attract foreign participation in KIL and thereby raise its paid-
in capital to W 3.0 billion. If and when these plans are executed KDB's
share in KIL's paid-in capital would reduce from the present 100% to 40%;
it would no more remain a subsidiary of KDB.
6.        KIL started its commercial operations in March 1973.  During its
16 months operations (March 1973 to June 1974) KIL signed 30 lease contracts
for a total amount of W 4.4 billion while 20 contracts for W 2.7 billion
were actually executed (leased items delivered). It was a good beginning
in the initial period yet the overall volume of operations was too small
to be profitable. During the 16 months period ended June 30, 1974, KIL
suffered a net loss of W 62 million. It was not due to any lack of market
or business opportunities but to inadequacy of capital resources of KIL.
A positive step to correct this situation has already been taken through
raising of KIL's paid in capital by W 1.0 billion and as stated in the
previous paragraph, KDB is planning to increase the capital further to
W 3 billion by foreign investment.

KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK
KDB's Role in the Economy
KDB in Perspective
1.        KDB is the largest long-term lending institution in Korea with a
share of 46% (US$530 million) of total medium- and long-term loans outstanding
by the banking sector at the end of October 1974, and it directly financed
8% of total fixed capital formation in 1973. As KDB on the average finances
about one third of total project cost of its clients and if guarantees are
included, KDB was involved in over 40% of fixed investment in the country
in 1973. The foreign currency portion of its total guarantee portfolio
(US$1.5 billion equivalent) accounted for 38% of Korea's total foreign
medium- and long-term debt at year end 1973).
2.        KDB finances nearly all sectors in the economy except Housing,
Agriculture and Fisheries for which Korea now has specialized institutions.
Most of its lending is concentrated in manufacturing and power generation
which together accounted for 75% of KDB's portfolio as of June 30, 1974. In
1973, disbursements to Korea Electric Company (KECO), the national electri-
city company, amounted to $41 million equivalent (49% of fixed capital forma-
tion in the power sector). KDB is the major channel for the Government to
invest in KECO and to supply the electricity sector with low interest
loans. KDB therefore accounts for almost 100% of total medium- and long-term
electricity loans outstanding of all banking institutions. Disbursements
to the manufacturing sector amounted to US$95 million in 1973 (15% of fixed
capital formation) and of all lending institutions in Korea it is the largest
source for medium- and long-term funds for manufacturing (its outstanding
loans at the end of 1974 amounted to US$158 million equivalent or 40% of all
medium- and long-term advances by the banking sector, including KDFC).
Economic Impact of KDB-lending
3.        By the sheer size of its financing and guarantee business KDB has
played an important role in Korea's economic development. Early in Korea's
post-Korean War development it was selected by the Government as its major
agency for implementing industrial policies and as its prime channel for
promoting the development of large-scale priority projects. As of 1972, KDB
had assisted 325 industrial enterprises that employwed 250,000 workers (26%
of total employment in industry) and whose output, in 1972, was valued at
US$1.2 billion equivalent (25% of total industrial output). Many of KDB
assisted projects are very capital intensive (steel mills, petrochemical



ANNEX 10
Page 2
plants) and for a sample of 109 projects completed between 1970 and 1973,
the average cost per job was about US$14,000 1/ compared to a national
average in 1972 of about US$4,200. If the two steel plants and three petro-
chemical plants are excluded from the sample, the average cost per job would
decrcease to US$4,100.   In compliance with Government policy, KDB has
effectively assisted many export-oriented enterprises which, in 1972, re-
presented 41% of the country's total manufacturing exports. Though recently
the Government has declared a wider geographic distribution of manufacturing
as an objective to increase industrial job opportunities for its rural
labor force, KDB's portfolio still reflects the overall geographic distribution
of Korea's manufacturing sector: 68% of KDB's total assistance went to
Seoul and Bussan provinces. 2/
4.        KDB assists both the public and private sectors, though only 35
of the total of 544 clients of as of December 1973 belonged to the public
sector. 71% of all assisted enterprises are joint stock companies accounting
for 95% of all outstanding loans, investments and guarantees as of December
31, 1973. KDB has about 100 clients with individual partnership, 75% of
which had no previous manufacturing experience thus contributing to the en-
trepreneurial base in the country. KDB has also supported 23 joint venture
enterprises importing capital and technical/marketing know how into the
country (the foreign partners own 58% of the total share capital). KDB has
also contributed to Korea's economic growth by promoting new projects which
over the last three years accounted for about 50% of its total assistance.
5.        Economic Rates of Return.  KDB does not routinely use the Economic
Rate of Return (ERR) concept in its appraisals, but at the request of the
Appraisal Mission calculated the internal rates of return for a sample of 28
projects. 3/ The methodology suggested by the Bank to DFCs associated with
the World Bank Group was followed and the exercise was competently handled.
The results of the exercise are summarized below:
1/   For comparison, a sample of 45 projects ftnanced by the Development Bank
of the Philippines in 1972/73 showed that the average cost per job was
the same US$14,000.
2/   In 1972, 74% of the manufacturing sectors value added was produced in
these two provinces, which also located 79% of all enterprises employing
200 or more workers.
3/   The sample was selected from projects appraised by the Foreign Loan
Department that handles projects financed from foreign funds. The
sample is distributed along KDB's fields of financing in manufactujring
but does not include large priority projects such as steel mills or
petrochemical plants. It does include 6 projects costing more than
US$2 million each and 8 projects where total investment costs were below
US$500,000 each. 3 of the companies are fairly large with total assets
over $10 million each while 7 companies had total assets of less than
US$500,000 each at the time of loan application. 12 projects were not
completed while 10 had been in in operation for over one year. 16 projects
are expansion projects while 12 are new and 11 projects export 50% or
more of their output.

22.1 - more                           13        17
6.        All projects had an Economic Rate of Return higher than the present
estimate of the opportunity cost of capital (12%) in Korea. Only four
projects had ERR of 17% or less; at the other extreme, three projects had
ERR in excess of 50%. The average ERR was 30%, higher than the average FRR
of 22% and only 3 projects had an ERR that was lower than the FRR. ERR's
were higher for non-completed projects (36%) calculated on the basis of
assumed costs and prices than for projects already in operation (26%) where
actual data was used. This could be a reflection of optimistic assumptions
or it could also be the result of a lowering of effective protection rates
in the country. Surprisingly, non-export projects did better (33%) than
export projects (27%) though three of the four projects with a low ERR are
producing mainly for the domestic market. The three projects with the
highest ERR are all producing for the domestic market; two are pharmaceutical
projects with no or very low effective protection and high financial profita-
bility (one of them produces a cold remedy specific to Korea) and the third
project produces news print for which the domestic price is government
regulated.
7.        The results of the ERR exercise given in the foregoing cannot be
considered as exact because many approximations were needed. However, the
figures indicate fairly the order of magnitude. The calculations also
reflect the fact that the criteria KDB used so far in its project selection
process have proved effective (even though the ERR concept has not been used)
and its priorities have been right from an economic point of view. The
generally satisfactory ERRs are not surprising because Korea's industrial
development policies and priorities have been highly successful and by adher-
ing to them closely, KDB made right decisions in allocating resources that
it mobilized.
Resource Mobilization
8.        As at December 31, 1974, KDB had total resources of W 629 billion
(US$1.3 million) 84% of which were in domestic currency. As a wholly owned
government development bank, KDB depends to a large extent on the funds
provided by the Government. Because of KDB's special role in financing
priority projects at preferential interest rates, it relies heavily on low
cost borrowings from the Government. In addition to providing funds in the
forn of equity (24% of total resources), the government has given loans to
KDB (23%), subscribed to its industrial finance debentures under the
Industrial Rationalization Fund (8%), provided funds from the NIF (7%) and
a small amount of Tourism Development funds from the Ministry of Transport-
ation. KDB's domestic resource mobilization at market rates has been limited
to (1) the issuance of regular Industrial Finance Debentures (W 75 billion



AN'NEX I 
Page 4
to (1) the issuance of regular Industrial Finance Debentures (W 88 billioin
or 15%) that were subscribed by commercial banks (42%) and the rest by
individduals at an effective rate of 14% per annum, and (2) by acceptance
of demand deposits and time deposits from its existing clients (7% of total).
KDB has also used a considerable portion of its borrowings from foreign
commercial banks in domestic currency (7% of total domestic resources).
9.        At December 31, 1974 foreign currency resources stood at $208 mol-
lion (16% of total resources). Until 1970, when KDB received its first lirne
of credit from ADB, foreign resources were allocated by the government from
loans from USAID and KfW. Since 1970, however, KDB's own eftorts have
gained momentum and it has been able to obtain 3 lines of credit from ADB
totalling $60 million, and in 1970 and again in 1974 was able to obtain Euro-
dollar loans for $25 million and $80 million respectively, the second
without government guarantee. Raising money from commercial sources is
difficult for KDB as international interest rates are close to Korea's long-
term lending rate ceilings.  However, even at the Euro-dollar rate plus a
mark up and with the borrower having to bear the exchange risk, KDB was able
to commit the second Euro-dollar loan very quickly as credit was tight
and the demand for medium- and long-term funds was heavy. In November 1974,
KDB borrowed US$19 million equivalent from Abu Dhabi and expects to tap
the Middle East and Arab capital market again in 1975.
10.       Besides the direct resource mobilization, KDB has been instrumental
in raising resources indirectly by influencing its clients to raise their
resources over and above those suggested in their loan applications. in a
small sample of 22 projects committed out of the second ADB loan (US$20
million), 8 sub-loans were made on the condition that the sub-borrowers w5SELd
increase their capital contribution or obtain subordinated loans from ma4cor
shareholders, thus raising an additional US$2.9 million. The sample is
admittedly small and does not represent an exact measure of KDBS' inds re.:
influence on resource mobilization. It does show, however, that KDB has
had at least some positive influence on its clients' investment behavior an,d
that it has not hesitated to use it. Overall, KDB finances about 30% of
total project cost and therefore for each unit of its lending, there is
usually a total investment of 3 units.
Ocher Developmental Activities
11.       KDB performs several other unique operations in addition to indus-
trial development financing. It carries out statistical surveys, conducts
economic and industrial research, undertakes engineering surveys and b"siness
analyses and provides managerial assistance to its projects. Besides these
regular activities, KDB has often been called upon by the Government tu. give
its opinion on major policy issues and its departments have assisted in mary
government projects and programs (e.g. assisting in making the preliminary
analysis of the Second 5-year Economic Plan or compiling basic worksheezs
for input-output analysis used to forecast industrial growth in specific



ANNEX 10
Page 5
areas). KDB's management is also regularly represented in many important
Government Committees such as the Economic Cabinet Meeting, Foreign Capital
inducement Deliberation Committee, Industrial Rationalization Council,
Advisory Committee for Economic Planning and the NIF-Management Council.
12.       Economic Research in KDB is done by three departments (Research,
Business Analysis, and Technical). They provide support to management and
operational departments on specific requests and perform, on a regular
basis, studies and surveys many of which are published and receive wide
circulation. For instance, KDB publishes an annual survey of financial
condition of enterprises, a Monthly Economic Review, a half-yearly Survey on
Equipment Investment and Program, a monthly Research Report and Weekly Econo-
mic Reports which present studies on current domestic and internatonal
economic issues such as recent developments and impact of world oil price
systems, an introduction to the current revision of Japanese' Commercial law,
a review on pollution measures, problems in joint ventures or a study on the
current exchange rates. KDB has also published comprehensive industrial
surveys and was the author of the book "Industry in Korea, 1970", which is
presently being updated. In addition, in connection with KDB's own financing
activities or upon the requests of outside sources, it conducts business
analyses and provides managerial assistance. Direct consulting services are
offered to those clients confronted with managerial difficulties, often in
the form of deputation of KDB staff to the affected companies. KDB also con-
ducts seminars on general management problems and publishes instructive mate-
rials on better managerial skills. In an attempt to improve appraisal capa-
bilities of Korea's banking system, KDB keeps special credit files on all
customers that received loans of over W 50 million. Other banks have, on
request, access to these credit files. Lastly, KDB's technical department is
asked by the Foreign Capital Inducement Deliberation Committee (FCIDC) to
perform engineering surveys on all proposed projects requesting foreign loan
guarantees. These surveys are the basis for decisions both of the FCIDC and
subsequently of KDB.

ANNEX 11

Broad details of associated terms and conditions of borrowed
resources of KDB are given in Annex 12. A brief review of each source
is given below.
Domestic Currency Resources
3.        Paid-in capital.  As required by the KDB Act, its entire paid-in
capital has been subscribed by the Government of Korea. The authorized
capital of KDB is W 300 billion (US$619 million) of which W 119.71 billion
hlas been presently (December 31, 1974) paid-in in three forms -- cash,
transfer of industrial shiares, and conversion of earlier government loans
to KDB. The amount in cash (W 66.3 billion) accounts for 55%, conversion
of government loans (W 27.5 billion) for 23% and transfer of industrial
shares (W 25.9 billion) for 22% of the total. Between January 1, 1972 and
December 31, 1974, KDB's paid-in capital has increased by more than 100%
from W 54.5 billion to W 119.7 billion. Of this increase about 87% was in
the form of cash. It is expected that KDB's paid-in capital will be further
raised by at least W 85 billion before the end of 1975.
4.         Reserves and Retained Earnings.  In terms of the provisions of
its charter, KDB maintains two types of reserves - "Legal Reserve" and
"Special Reserve". Until November 1968 KDB Act had required 50% of each
year's net income to be paid to government and the remaining 50% to be
transferred to the "Legal Reserve". After an amendment to the Act in 1968,
100% of net income is now transferred to "Legal Reserve", and the Govern-
ment does not receive any dividend. The Act further provides that if in
any year KDB suffers a net loss, this is to be adjusted against "Legal
Reserve" and thiat if total amount of loss exceeds the amount of available
reserve, the deficiency slhall be covered by the Government. As per KDB's
unaudited balance sheet as of December 31, 1974 the "Legal Reserve" stood
at W 17.342 billion.
5.        In December 1961, by virtue of an amendment to KDB Act, a "Special
R\eserve" of W 1.50 billion was created by a cash subscription by the Govern-
ment. The reserve is available for absorbing any eventual losses on loans
made by KDB prior to December 1961 and on its equity investment in the
Readjustnment Corporation (a subsidiary of KD)B acting as its arrears col-
lection agent, see Annex 8). So far net loss charged to "Special Reserve"
amounts to W 6.66 million only and therefore the net balance of this reserve
as of December 31, 1974 was W 1.493 billion.
6.        As of December 31, 1974 the amount of unappropriated net income
was W 4.1 billion (unaudited and provisional) and total "Reserves and Re-
tained Earnings", W 22.9 billion, composed as follows:

Legal Reserve                                 17.342
Special Reserve                                1.493
Unappropriated Earnings                        4.095
Total                                    22.930
7.        Borrowings from tihe Government.  This represents a major source
of domestic currency resources for KDB.  KDB's reliance on this source has
in the recent past declined from about 46% of total domestic currency re-
sources as of December 31, 1969 to 27% as of December 31, 1974. The Govern-
ment has provided these funds in the form of annual budgetary allocations
and from three sources: (a) Economic Development Fund, (b) Foreign Loan
Repayment Fund and (c) Counterpart Funds.
8.        Economic Development Fund represents Government's own general
funds and are allocated to KDB for financing of pre-identified as well as
general projects. The interest rate charged by the Government on these
funds varies from 6% to 12%, with a weighted average of 6.2% as of June 30,
1974. The repayment schedules of these funds range from 5 years to 35 years.
The present borrowing (W 120.5 billion as of December 31, 1974) are repayable
in instalments spread up to year 2009; heaviest burden of repayment will be
between 1975 and 1993 when 86% of the present outstanding borrowing will
become due.
9.        Foreign Loan Repayment Fund and Counterpart Fund loans represent
government lending to KDB out of either grants received from abroad by the
Government of Korea or counterpart funds created as a result of early repay-
ments received from various agencies. These were lent to KDB for making
equipment loans to Government projects. The interest charged by the Govern-
ment on these borrowings varies between 2% to 5%; weighted average interest
rate as of June 30, 1974 was 2.4%. KDB's net outstanding borrowings from
these sources stood at W 16.1 billion as of December 31, 1974. No alloca-
tion of these funds has been made to KDB after 1971.
10.       Industrial Finance Debentures (IFD).  In terms of its Act, KDB
alone can issue the IFDs. Through the instrument of these debentures, KDB
attracts institutional as well as individual savings. Thie interest rates
on IFDs is presently 12.69%. Repayment of all IFDs is secured by a govern-
ment guarantee and therefore prior approval of the National Assembly is
required before IFDs are issued by KDB. Duration of IFDs is medium-term
(2 to 5 years) and iinterest is paid annually in advance. Considering the
discotunt factor (interest for one year is deducted from the initial issue
price of IFI) and for thie subsequent years is paid in advance) the effective
weighted average interest rate on IFDs outstanding as of December 31 , 1974
(W 78.u billion) was 14%.  About 42% of outstanding IFDs lhave been subscribed
by cosmmercial banks and financial institutions whlile 58A have been subscribed
by general public.



ANNEX 11

11.       Revolving Funds.  USAID and KflW foreign currency loans to KDB
nave fixed amortization schedules. KDB's collections over and above its
repayments are pooled in two separate revolving funds - USAID Revolving
Fund and KfW Revolving Fund - and used for the financing of domestic cur-
rency loans. In order to safeguard itself against possible loss resulting
from exchange rate fluctuations, KDB takes two precautions. Firstly, it
relends these funds with a "Dollar/Deutsche Mark value maintenance clause"
thereby passing the exchange risk on to the sub-borrowers. Secondly, it
judiciously manages these funds so as to reduce to a minimum the time gap
between their accrual and redisbursement. So far KDB appears to have been
successful in minimizing the exchange risk associated with these funds.
As of December 31, 1974 total revolving funds amounted to i; 3.9 billion
of which W 2.2 billion had been relent while the balance had also been
committed and was to be disbursed as soon as the associated formalities
were completed.
12.       Special Finance Debentures.  In terms of the August 3, 1972
Presidential Emergency Decree, KDB was required to lower its lending rates
and to provide special loans to certain specified sectors on softer terms
(8% interest rate and 5 years repayment term including 3 years of grace)
so as to enable them to repay the existing loans on relatively harder
terms. In pursuance of this Emergency Decree, KDB provided special loans
aggregating W 27.3 billion.  This in effect meant restructuring of existing
loans in the sense of a longer repayment schedule and a lower interest rate.
In order to compensate KDB, the Government of Korea introduced the scheme
of "Special Finance Debentures". Under this scheme, the Government sub-
scribed to KDB's Special Finance Debentures in an amount equal to KDB's
special financing under Emergency Decree of August 3, 1972 (W 27.3 billion).
These special debentures carry interest rate at 5.5% and are repayable in
6 to 8 years. The money received by KDB through issuance of these deben-
tures is kept in a special deposit account with Bank of Korea. This deposit
bears interest at 12.5% and therefore the mechanism of special debentures
provides an interest subsidy of 7% (the differential between rates of in-
terest income on deposit and interest payable by KDB on special debentures).
13.       Industrial Rationalization Fund (IRF).  Tihis fund was also created
under the Emergency Presidential Decree of August 3, 1972 for providing fi-
nances on relatively softer terms (presently 8% per annum interest and re-
payment term of 8 years including 3 years of grace for capital loans and
one year for operating loans) for thie rationalization and development of
highi economic priority industries.  Lndustries eligible for obtaining fi-
nances from TIRl are basic industries and thiose producing essential consumer
goods, intermediate products, machinery and exportable products.  In addi-
tion, agro-based industries such as fislieries, directly contributing to
farmers' non-farm income are also eligilie for financing under IRF.  Although
in terms of the provisions of thle Presidential Decree, IRF can be used for
making loans as well as investments, and for direct property acquisitions,
etc., so far KDB has used it for lending purposes only.



ANNEX 1 1
Page 5
14.       IRF is administered by 1BDB within the broad policy guidelines
formulated and laid-down by Industrial Rationalization Council which works
under the control of the Prince Minister. The Council itself consists of
8 members including ministers of Economic Planning (Chairman of the Council),
Finance, Agriculture and Fishery and Economic Affairs, Governors of KDB and
Bank of Korea and two representatives from public designated by the President.
(At present no private individual is on the Council.) In essence the func-
tion of the Council is to lay down and amend, whenever necessary, the cri-
teria for eligibility of specific industries for IRF financing, procedural
aspects and overall terms and conditions. Investment decisions relating to
specific projects are taken by KDB on the basis of its appraisal of each
sub-project. KDB can also lend IRF through commercial banks which would in
turn relend these funds to end users at the uniform rate of 12% per annum
(8% per annum up to December 7, 1974).
15.       In terms of the provisions of the Presidential Decree, the re-
sources of IRF could consist of: (a) subscriptions by Government, (b) bor-
rowings from Government, (c) issue of Industrial Finance Debentures, (d)
borrowings of foreign capital, (e) repayments received from sub-borrowers
and (f) short-term borrowings from Bank of Korea in case of emergency needs.
In fact only two sources have so far been tapped to raise funds for IRF -
borrowings from Government and issue of Industrial Finance Debentures.
Government has lent funds to IRF out of PL 480 funds (tallow imports),
USAID Counterpart Funds and its direct borrowings for this purpose from
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) and Export-Import Bank, both of
Japan. The OECF and Exim Bank funds carry interest rates of 2 to 5% per
annun and have long repayment periods (15 to 40 years including grace
periods ranging from 5 to 10 years). These funds carry "Dollar/Yen value
maintenance clause" and therefore entail exchange risk for KDB. KDB sets
aside 1.5% of annual interest income under IRF financing to a special
reserve to cover the potential exchange loss.  Exchange fluctuation losses
in excess of this reserve are to be met by the Government of Korea.
16.       Industrial Finance Debentures issued by KDB under IRF (W 13.3 bil-
lion up to December 31, 1974) are identical to IFDs issued by KUD3 for financ-
ing its normal operations (see para 10). Thie negative margin on IFD funds
lent under IRI arising because of higher interest cost (about 14%) than the
relending rate (12%;) Ls reimbursed to KIB by thie Government of Korea.
17.       Tourisnm Development Fund (TDF).  TDF has becn provided to KDB by
Ministry of Transportation for financing of tourism projects sucth as lhotels,
etc.  These funcds, the net outstanding amount of wlhichi was W 380 million as
of D)ecember 31, 1974, are provided to KH)B at 6% per annum and their relend-
ing rate has been fixed by thie Government at 7.5% per annum. The repayment
term is eight years.
18.       National Investment Fund (NIF).  NIF was created by the Govern-
ment of Korea on January 1, 1974 with the objective of mobilizing national
savings for the financing of heavy and chemical industries during 1974-81.
This fund derives its resources through government allocations and sale of



ANNEX 11
Page  6
Investment Fund Bonds to National Savings Associations, newly set up National
welfare Pension Fund System, Postal Insurance and trust companies and the
various public funds as may be designated by special Presidential Decree.
NIF funds are available to KDB for financing heavy and chemical sectors
only. Allocations out of NIF are made by Bank of Korea to KDB on an annual
basis, but actual disbursements are linked with individual sub-projects.
Apart for KDB, other financial institutions and commercial banks are also
entitled to use NIF.
19.       Borrowings (W 40.7 billion as of December 31, 1974) under NIF
carry interest rate at 10.5% per annum and are relent at the pre-speci-
fied rate of 12% per annum. Tihe repayment term of NIF is 8 years for
equipment loans and 3 years for operating loans.
20.       Deposits.  KDB Act authorizes it to accept time deposit in domestic
as well as foreign currencies and demand deposits only from its existing
clients. As of December 31, 1974, KDB had time deposits of W 41.5 billion
(W 7.1 billion in domestic currency and W 34.4 billion in foreign currency)
and call deposits amounting to W 2.5 billion. Most of the time deposits
in domestic currency came from financial institutions while almost all
foreign currency deposits were made by Korea Exchange Bank out of the pro-
ceeds of its own foreign currency borrowings. On its domestic currency
deposits KDB was paying interest up to January 24, 1974 at 6% for over 3
months deposits, 8.4% for over 6 months deposits, 12.0% for over 12 months
deposits and 12.6% for over 24 months deposit. With effect from January 24,
1974, these rates have been raised to 12.(%, 13.2%, 15% and 15% respectively.
On its foreign currency deposits, KDB pays interest at a floating rate which
as at June 30, 1974 was about 10%. Funds raised through deposits (in domes-
tic as well as foreign currencies) are used by KDB mainly for making working
capital (operating) loans. Exchange risk on foreign currency deposits which
are converted in domestic currency and used for financing Won currency loans
is passed on to the sub-borrowers througlh inclusion of "Dollar value main-
tenance clause" in the sub-loan agreements.
Foreign Currency Resources
21.       Foreign Currency Lines of Credit.  KDB contracted its first for-
eign currency borrowing from USAID in April 1960 in the form of a line of
credit of US$5 million equivalent. This was followed by two more lines of
credit aggregating US$22.374 million (net of cancellation) obtained in 1966
and 1968. From 1966 KDB started borrowing from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederufbau
(KfW) of West Germany, which has so far provided three lines of credit aggre-
gating DN 40 million (US$16.5 million). KDB establislhed its business rela-
tions witli Asian Development Bank (AI)B) in 1970 when it obtained a line of
crediit ol US$10 million equivalent.  In 1972 and 1974 KDiB obtained two more
lincs of credlit of US$20 million and US$30 million respectively from ADB.
22.       USA1D and KfW loans are basically borrowings of thie Government of
Korea relent to RDB. The AI)B loans are, however, direct borrowings of KDB
against Government of Korea's guarantee.

23.        Interest rates associated witih the foreign currency lines of
crecit range between 5 to 8.5%.  The first two USAID loans and first KfW
loan carry interest at 5%, the third USAID loan at 6%, second KfW. loan at
S%, third KfW loan at 7% and all ADD loans hiave variable interest rate
(presently 8-1/2%). These funds ihave been relent by KD13 witlh spreads
ranging from 2 to 4% (wieighted average 2.81%). Whereas, repayments of
all ADB and first USAID loans are linked with the repayment schedules of
sub-borrowers, the borrowings from KfW and USAID (last two loans) are
repayable according to fixed schedules extending to 15-30 years.
24.        Eurodollar Loans from Comrnercial Banks.  KDB has so far obtained
two Eurodollar loans - US$25 million in June 1970 and US$80 million in
January 1974 (both were syndicated loans). The first loan managed by
Manufacturers Hanover Ltd., London, was subscribed by 31 banks from Japan,
U.S.A., K.K., Canada, Panama, Switzerland and Hong Kong and UNDP. The
second loan was managed by a consortium of four banls (Banker's Trust Com-
panv of London, Citicorp International Bank Ltd., London, Asia Pacific
Capital Corporation, Hong Kong, and B.T. Finance Ltd., llong Kong), and was
subscribed by 38 banks from Japan, U.K., U.S.A., Hong Kong, Singapore,
Canada and Australia.
25.        The first Eurodollar loan carries interest at 1.75% plus Eurodol-
lar deposit rate prevailing in London two working days before each interest
payment with a maximum of 11.75%. (Interest is paid bi-annually.) In terms
of the original Loan Agreement, the interest rate was stipulated at 2% plus
the inter-bank Eurodollar deposit rate, but the mark up was reduced on
December 20, 1972 to 1.75% througlh an amendment of the Loan Agreement.  The
mark up over the inter-bank rate for the second Eurodollar loan is 1% but
there is no fixed maximum rate. The effective interest rate on the first
loan is currently 11.75% and that on the second loan 14.07%.  The repayment
terms of these two loans are 5 years and 10 years respectively.
26.        Issuance of Industrial Finance Debentures (IFD) in Foreign Currency.
In October 1974 KDB issued for the first time its IFDs in foreign currency
for $18.8 million to the Government of Abu Dhabi. These debentures carry
interest at 8-1/2% and are repayable over 'l years after 6 years of grace.
Issuance of IFDs in foreign currencies are expected to increase in the
tuture.

1   Income statements for fiscal  1970, 1972 and 1973 are audited by external independent auditors - Messrs.
Arthur Young & Co. - while those for fiscal  1969 and 1971 are audited only by KDB's own internal
auditor.  The results of 1974 are unaudited.
J Consistent with the general accounting practice followed by the banking and financial institutions in
Korea, KDB reports income in its financial statements on actual receipt basis and expenses on accrual
basis. The operating results summarized above are based on cash-cum-accrual basis of accounting for
fiscal 1969 through 1971   and 1974, while those of fiscal 1972 and 1973 have been adjusted
by external auditors to conform to accrual basis of accounting both for incomes and eaenses.  The net
income figures of fiscal  1969 through 1971 and 1974 if adjusted to conform to accruat basis (incomes
aa well as expenses) of accounting, would appear as follows:

1/ Balance sheets as of December 31, 1970, 1972 and 1973 are audited by external independent auditor -
Messrs. Arthur Young & Co. - while those as at December 31, 1969 and 1971 are audited by KDB's own
internal auditor. The balance sheet as at December 31, 1974 is unaudited.
2/  Consistent with general accounting practice followed by the banking and financial institutions in
Korea, KDB reports income in its financial statements only on actual receipt basis and expenses on
accrual basis. As a result income accrued and receivable is not shown in the balance sheet as an
asscit and on the other hand the retained earnings are understated.  Except for KDB's balance sheets
as it December 31, 1972 and 1973 which have been adjusted by external auditors so as to be on complete
accrual basis of accounting, all other balance sheets are based on cash-cum-accrual basis of accounting.
If appropriate adjustments are made for 1969 through 1971 and 1974 the following balance sheet items
would be amended as indicated:
As of December 31                               1969      1970       1971       1974

2/  Includes investment in equity shares, bonds and debentures.
2/ Domestic currency loans and investments are projected to get committed on an
average one month after approval and foreign currency loans 15 days after
approval. In other words 92% of domestic currency loan and investment
approvals and 96% of foreign currency loan approvals of each year are pro-
jected to be casmitted in the same year and the balance in the following year.
This represents KDB's loan commitment experience in the past.
3   In respect of its domestic currency loans,it is KDB's practice to fully credit
the sub-borrower's loan account soon after the sub-loan agreement is signed.
Therefore KDB's domestic currency loan disbursemet are projected to be equal
to yearly commitments. Foreign currency loans are projected to get disbursed
6 month after cornmitment i.e. 50% each in the year of commitment and in the
following year. 100% of yearly commitments for investments are projected to
get disbursed in the same year.
