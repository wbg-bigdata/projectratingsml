SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1828-BT)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Second
Education Project in Botswana, for which Loan 1828-BT of US$10.0 million
was approved on April 1, 1980. The Loan was closed on June 30, 1987, two
years behind schedule.    The last disbursement was made in January 1988
when a.a undisbursed balance of US$1.84 millior. was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by UNESCO (Parts I and III) and the
P ulation and Human Resources Operations Division, Southern Africa
D,artment, Africa Regional Office (Preface and Evaluation Summary). It is
based on: (i) the findings of the UNESCO project completion missio.n to
Botswana during September-October, 1988; (ii) discussions with people
knowledgeable about the project; and (iii) data from project files at Bank
headquarters in Washington.
The Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and III of the draft PCR uith a
request to prepare Part II. A reply has not been received.

SI.COND EDUCATION PROJECT
_ _ (LOAN 1828-BT)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       The Second Education rroject  (Education II) in Botswana was
identified by the Bank in January 1978 and prepared by the Government with
Bank assistance about a year later. Appraisal followed in May/June 1979;
negotiations were held in Washington in February 1980, and the project was
presented to the Board on April 1, 1980. Loan signing took place on April
16, 1980 and the Loan became effective on June 13, 1980. The project was
scheduled to be completed in December 1984 and the Closing Date was June
30, 1985.  The total estimated project cost of US$15.0 million equivalent
was to be financed by a Bank Loan of US$10.0 million equivalent and US$5.0
million of government funds.   The Loan Agreement was amended in October
1984 to accommodate some minor changes in the community junior secondary
schools component.   The Closing Date was postponed to June 1987.   The
project was practically completed by the end of 1987 and the loan account
was closed in January 1988.
Objectives and Project Content
2.       The basic goals of education in Botswana, according to the Fifth
National Development Plan, were to (a) increase educational opportunities
and reduce inequalities as far as resources permitted; (b) contribute to
the balanced development of Botswana by seeking to satisfy manpower
requirements for all sectors; and (c) promote respect for national ideals,
self reliance and concern for other people and to encourage the full
development of individual talents. In accordance with these basic goals,
Education II had three main objectives: (i) development of a network of
community junior secondary schools (CJSS) to facilitate eventual universal
access to this level of education; (ii) expansion of rural vocational
training at the Brigade Centers; and (iii) improvement of training of civil
servants and public sector personnel in management skills, accountancy,
public finance and commerce.   To achieve these objectives,  the project
comprised three main components:
(a)  A program of assistance for 11 existing and 7 new CJSS which would
be provided with classrooms, science laboratories and administra-
tive offices to increase educational opportunities for about 3,850
students in the existing schools and 1,680 students in the new
schools;



- iii -
(b)  Continuation of the assistance provided under Education I for the
Youth Brigades by expanding the existing 16 Brigade Centers with
the addition of 7 new ones, and 9 Agricultural Brigades; and
(c)  Expansion of the Institute of Development Management (IDM) and the
Botswar.a Institute of Accountancy and Commerce (BIAC).
Implementation Experience
3.       Overall implementation was satisfactory, and the physical objec-
tives were achieved, except the Agricultural Brigades were deleted from the
project and the funds originally allocated to them were applied to the
Youth Brigades. The PIU, which had been established to implement the First
Education Project, had difficulty filling the positions of project archi-
tect and quantity surveyor.   When the PIU Director's contract ended in
April 1984, a replacement was not appointed until January 1985.   Project
implementation was delayed by staffing problems in the PIU and the need to
resolve Government policy regarding the Brigades before further development
could proceed with them.  An important development during implementation
was the 127 percent appreciation of the US dollar over the Pula between
1981 and 1985.  Government request to use the surplus funds to add eight
more CJSS to the project was denied by the Bank on grounds that the addi-
tions would widen the project scope beyond the original intention. However,
the Bank had no objections to the provision of additional facilities to the
16 project CJSS to bring them up to a uniform standard. The Closing Date
was postponed twice, from June 1985 to June 1986, and subsequently to June
1987, to allow more time to implemer.t the Brigades component. The project
was practically completed by the end of 1987. Technical assistance, on the
whole, was effectively utilized. Total project costs were US$12.72 million
equivalent, 15 percent lower than the appraisal estimate of US$15.0
million, or Pula 19.05 million, 54 percent higher than the appraisal
estimate of Pula 12.31 million.
Results
4.       The project succeeded in providing eight new and 10 expanded CJSS
with the necessary facilities. These schools in 1988 enrolled a total of
about 6,840 students, compared with the appraisal projected enrollment of
6,680. Under the Youth Brigades component, the project provided 26 class-
rooms, 7 workshops, 6 construction areas, 8 administrative blocks, 8
kitchens with dining facilities, and 2 hostels, all appropriately furnished
and equipped.   The total number of trainees at the Brigade Centers in-
creased rapidly from 717 in 1985 to 978 in 1987. In the Botswana Institute
for Accounting and Commerce (formerly the Botswana Training Center), the
output varied from year to year according to the courses offered, but
ranged berween 230 and 310 during 1983-87. No information was available on
the output from the Institute of Development Management. The qualitative
impact of the project is seen in the improvement in the pass rate of
students in project CJSS taking the Junior Certificate examilation.   The
percentage of passes rose steadily from about 36 percent in 1983 to 64



- iv -
percent in 1987. Although the PIU was provided with technical assistance
and its administrative costs were funded by the project, there was no
significant institution-building through staff development.
Sustainability
5.       The project has contributed to the creation and expansion of the
CJSS through the provision of physical facilicies and equipment.   The
operation of these schools, however, is a community responsibility, while
the provision of teachers is shared by the community and the MOE.   The
sustainability of the CJSS therefore would depend on community support,
which hitherto has been strong, and the supply of teachers, which has been
somewhat problematic because of the limited output from the University
College of Botswana.   The opening of the new secondary teacher training
college in Molepolole in 1985, with a target output of 150 teachers a year
from 1987, sl'ould augment the supply of teacherq. The Government decision
in May 1983 that the Youth Brigades would be t - responsibility of the MOE
provided t:e necessary assurance of budgetary support for the Brigade
Centers whtch operate the various vocational training courses.   The
sustainability of the Brigades prograw will therefore depend to a large
extent on improved management which has been weak at the central and local
levels. The Brigade Development Center (BRIDEC), charged with the overall
supervision of the training program and its evaluation, needs to clarify
its operational direction.   The IDM and BIAC were reported as early as
December 1983 to be in full operation and appeared to be effective educa-
tional entities, properly staffed and fully utilized.
Findings and Lessons
6.       The overall physical objectives and a substantial part of the
qualitative objectives of the project have been achieved, although the full
impact of the project awaits later evaluation. Evidently a fully staffed
PIU at the start is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for
expeditious implementation.  The lack of a full-time project architect and
quantity surveyor handicapped implementation, which in this case was also
delayed by unresolved policy matters regarding the Brigades.  The fact that
the status of the Brigade Centers emerged as an issue soon after the start
of implementation suggested that appraisal of this component was inad-
equate.   The Bank's inability to accommodate the Government's request to
utilize surplus funds to increase the number of schools to be constructed
or expanded showed that the project design did not allow for such variation
during implementation.   From this experience, this project suggests the
following lessons:
(a) The staffing of key positions in the PIU should be a condition of
loan or credit effectiveness;
(b) Policy issues concerning project institutions should be resolved
before project implementation; and
(c) Flexibility should be incorporated into project design to permit
changes in project scope so long as they are consistsnt with proj-
ect objectives.

2.    Back2round
Sector Development Objectives
When the country became independant, education was not developed to a point
where it could make an adequate contribution to the national development.
Principal weaknesses were (i) insufficient participation rate in primary
i.ducAtion, (ii) inadequacy of curricula, (iii) very limited availability of
secondary education, (iv) unavailability of employment oriented/employment
generating training, and (v) institutional weaknesses. The sectoral objectives
of a series of World Bank projects in Education were the elimination of these
bottlenecks through appropriate project components.   The second education
project concentrated on nun-formal training, secondary education, staff
training for the public and private sector, and on institution building.
Linkages with other Bank Project in Education
The First Educacion Project was supporting the first phase of the
Governments educational investment plan, and aimed at increasing secondary
school enrolment as well as teacher training; similar to the second project,
Youth Brigades also were being financed.   Thus, the Second Project was a
logical extension of the first one.  It became effective before the first
project was completed, so that continuity was assured.
The Third Project largely ran parallel with rhe second one, extending
financing to the primary education sector. Since then, a fourth Bank Education
Project, again supporting the established Government policy in the field of
education, is being implemented.
Linkages between Project, Sector and Macro-economic Policy Objectives.
Policy objective of the Government is the improvement of the living
standards of the population at large. As the availability of educational
opportunities is an integral factor of the living standard, education does not
fulfill a subservient role only, in support of economic development, but
rather is an objective by itself.   Hence,  teacher education   plays an
important role, as it would facilitate generalization of educational
opportunities. In a similar way, non-formal training is important to avoid
that education become a dead end, leading nowhere. Yet, given the prevailing
weakness of formal training, youth brigade training makes an important



- 2 -
contribution to sustaining the country's economic achievements made possible
by the development of the mining sector (mainly diamonds).
3.    Project Objectives and Descri2tion
Project Objectives
(i)   Development of, and improvement in, educational opportunities for
junior secondary education;
(ii)  Strengthening  of  rural,  non  formal  training  through  Youth
Brigades;
(iii) Improving the standards of the Public Sector through the
development of the Botswana Training Center (BTC) for the civil
service, and improving the development capacity by supporting tPe
Institute of Development Management (IDM);
(iv)  Institution building through support to BEPU.
Project Description
In order to achieve these objectives, the project comprised the following
components:
(i)   Construction, furniture, and equipment for seven new, and eleven
extensions to existing, Community Junior Secondary Schools
(CJSSs);
(ii)  Civil works,  furniture and equipment  for seven new Brigade
Centers;
(iii) Support to nine Agricultural Brigades;
(iv)  Support to BTC;
(v)   Further development of IDM.
Items (iv) and (v) were relatively small, absorbing together only 8 per cent
of the credit proceeds.
Technical assistance (TA) was to be provided to BEPU, for which also part
of the operational expenses would be financed. Equipment was to comprise also
transport equipment. However, technical assistance for institutions assisted
under the project was also forthcoming from other international sources
(UNDP/UN-Executing Agencies), and from bilateral agencies.
4.    Project DesiunL an  Organization
Conceptual Framework
As the project was, in large measure, an extension of the first education
project, the conceptual framework was clear in its broad lines, *hile some
implementation details were to be worked out later. It would appear in
retrospect, however, that the project suffered from some conceptual
imbalances: financial assistance was spread to many non-homogenwous, and
sometimes small project cotiponents. As a consequence, the implementation of
the  relatively  small  extension  programmes   (BTC,   IDM)   involved  a



- 3 -
disproportionally high workload with regard to architectural design.
construction, site supervision etc.
Innovations
In a wider context, the concept of Brigade training was innovative, though
not for Botswana. This kind of training had already been assisted under the
first World Bank Education Project.   Hence,  there was no particularly
innovative feature incorporated in the Second Project. Rather, the Project
attempted ro consolidate the progress made under the first project in the
implementation of the innovative brigade training - it would thus eventually
demonstrate the validity of the concept (validity in the context of an
expanding economy which provides jobs for the trainees who can thus be
absorbed in gainful employment).
The other components of the project were, again, undertaken in continuation
of concepts already being implemented, without specific innovative features.
Project Preparation
The Project was first mentioned in Bank files in January 1977, was then
"identified" by the Bank in January 1978, and subsequently prepared by the
Covernment over a 15-month period. Tne Bank assisted in project preparation
through the missions visiting the country to supervise implementation of the
first project. Appraisal took place in April 1980, and the Loan Agreement was
signed on 16 April; the Loan became effective on 13 June 1980 - about one
month earlier than originally planned.
In terms of duration, the project formulation and preparation period was
shorter than average. This became possible through a high intensity of Bank
activities - no less than 10.1 staff-weeks of Bank missions visited the
country between identification and Board approval. These activities allowed
for the Bank to gain not only an intimate knowledge of conditions prevailing
in the country, but to also exercise a certain influence in the process of
decision making.    As thus the project was developed in tandem with the
progressive clarification of the Governments preferences and priorities, it
enjoyed subsequently the full support of the Government.
Appropriateness of Timing
The timing of the project was appropriate, as it overlapped with the first
project, thus permitting continuity of country-Bank cooperation in the field
of education. Also, it was timed so as to back up activities started under
the first project which might, without continued support, have lapsed back.
Institutional Roles and Responsibilities
These were clear as they, too, were undertaken in continuation to the first
project, the only difference being in the volume of work to be undertaken.
This subsequently led to some staffing problems.



Contributions to Project SucceFs/Failure
These are hard to pinpoint, as the project may, with some justification,
be considered either a success or a failure.  A success in so far as the
inscitucions tc be financed under the project, were, in fact, built, furnished
and equipped.   But on the other hand, it has not been possible to fully
utilize the loan proceeds - which certainly was s disappointment for the
Government, and appears to have led to some tensions.  Causal for the "under-
spending" was the development of the US$ exchange rate which increased t'e
purchasing power of the loan proceeds.
On the whole, however, one would say that the positive aspects of project
implementation prevailed as demonstrated by the subsequent agreements
concerning the third and fourth education projects.   Contributing to the
overall success was the close Government-Bank cooperation in project
formulation and implementation.
5.    Project Imolementation
Critical Variances between Project Design and Implementation
Although there were no major changes to the objectives and the general
thrust of the project, variances occurred with concerned principally:
(i)   the adjustment of project content to the increase of purchasing
power of the loan proceeds, and to local executive agencies, and
as a consequence,
(ii)  the timing of the project which was, however, also influenced by
staffing problems experienced by BEYU.
In oatail, the variances concerned the following:
(a)   the Youth Brigades: For two years after the loan effectiveness,
the Government had put a freeze on expenditures for the brigade
training component, as a controversy concerning their status had
not been resolved; at that time,the Government even asked for a
transfer of the funds earmarked for the brigade to the CJSS
component. When this was not approved, it was decided that the
concept of agricultural brigades should no longer be supported,
-is multiple activities produced better economic and training
results. As a consequetice, all funds under this heading should
be used for the establishment or extensions of an increased number
of brigade centers; adjustments in the scale of construction would
permit the 1acrease from 16 to 20 centers without additional
costs;
(b)   the physical facilities of the 16 CJSS in the project should be
brought into line with newly approved Government standards, and
to this effect a total seven science rooms, 15 library/classrooms,
9 multi-purpose blocks and five administrative blocks was approved
by the Bank, estimated costs being US$2.1 million;
(c)   the training of two auditors of the Auditor-General's office was
financed, in the interest of the project, out of the "unallocated"
category of the loan.



- 5 -
Further project modifications proposed by the Government, i.e. the
construction of 77 staff houses, and eventually the use of US$1.8 million in
savings, were not approved by the Bank.
A variation if not in project content and thrust, then in financial volume
occurred when, again as the result of the stronger US$. the Government
requested cancellation of the aforementioned US$1.8 million at the end of the
project.
Whereas the expansion of the construction programme justified an extension
of the project completion date, it was not sizeable enough to absorb the
savings made. Hence, the cancellation of the unspent amount became inevitable.
Avoidability of Variances
In the light of the changes in the USS exchange rate, adjustments to the
project were unavoidable. This being the case, it would seem that the country
might have benefitted more from the loan had the decision by the Government
to request an extension of project scope, and by the Bank to approve/
disapprove such request been taken earlier on.
Calibration of Project Risks
The appraisal report mentions as risks (i) the possible shortage of
mathematics and science teachers for the CJSSs, and (ii) the formation and
operation of the agricultural brigades. As to (i), this concerned only the
timing of an eventual full and adequate utilization of the newly constructed
facilities, but not the validity of the construction as such (even if teaching
would not initially be of the desired quality, it would yet take place, and
the facilities would be used). As to the agricultural brigades, the specific
steps mentioned in the appraisal report in order to minimize the risks have
either not been taken, or they did not have the desired effect: the
agricultural brigades were eventually discarded. Yet, one would say that the
risks were adequately calibrated, because the brigade training scheme as such
has continued with Bank support, and is proving its validity.
Unforeseen Factors affecting Project Implementation
The major unforeseen factor affecting project implementation was the
development of the US$ exchange rate. Other factors were (i) the staffing
problems of BEPU, and (ii) the unresolved question of Government policy with
regard to the (autonomous) status of the brigades.
Actions/Decisions affecting P:oject Implementation
By deciding that as far as possible project implementation should soaform
to the concept originally approved in the Loan Agreement, while accommodating
Government requests for modifications where they were inevitable, the Bank had
a major role in the implementatiotn of the project - as one in a string of
preceding and succeeding education projects. Whereas thus no particular action
/ decision can be singled out, it was probably the continuity in Bank-country
cooperation that turned out to be decisive.



On the part of the Government the staffing difficulties encountered by
BEPU had a retarding effect on project implementation. It would .eem that a
variety of factors came into play: (i) the desire on the part of the
Government to not unduly expand the role of expatriates; (ii) slowing down of
housing construction as a result of the drought; (iii) questions by the
Government as to the need for appointing one more expatriate architect. The
situation was resolved only with the appointment of a new Director for BEPU.
6.    Project Results
Physical Project Results
The most tangible project result lies in the implementation of the extended
construction programme: seven new CJSSs have been made available, and another
15 CJSSs now provide fully adequate facilities for the implementation of new
curricula, including practical subjects: CJSSs not only have classrooms but
also multi-purpose hall and science block, in addition to administrative and
library facilities; for details, see Annex 1.
Under the brigade scheme, 26 classrooms were built, 7 wood workshops (+ 4
axtensions), 6 constructions areas (+1 extension), in addition to 8
administrative blocks, 2 hostels, and 8 kitchen with dining facilities (for
details, see Annex 2).  New and extended facilities were also equipped and
furnished.
For BTC (renamed subsequently BIAC - Botswana Institute for Accountancy
and Commerce), a hostel with 60 beds for female trainees, and a classroom
block was  constructed,  while  the  extension  of  IDM  consisted  in  the
construction of administrative space, an audio-visual room, and a library
study area.
Construction work has been designed and executed satisfactorily, with some
minor inconveniences, however.
Provision of furniture and equipment allowing usage of the facilities in
line with the agreed upon educational intentions must also be mentioned
amongst the physical project results.
Qualitative Results
Paramount amongst these are the quality improvements in (junior) secondary
education and in (brigade) training. Also the quality of training in the BIAC
and the IDM has reportedly improved. No attempt has yet been made t.o quantify
the contribution of quality improvements to the national development.
Quantitative Results
The seven new CJSSs and the extended CJSSs under the project enrolled in
1988 a total of 6,839 students; this figure is somewhat distorted as the
school system is presently in the transition from a 6+3+3 instead of the
previous 7+2+3 structure. It is not possible to attribute in detail the
enrolment to previously existing, and to new educational facilities in CJSSs.
All the same, in can be said that in qualitative terms the project exceeded



-7-
its targets through the addition of the extension programme; for details, see
Annex 1.
For the other project components (BTC, IDM, and Brigades) the enrolment
increase cannot be detailed, as facilities added were so designed as to have
an impact on the quality of training rather than on the quantity.
Institution Building Results
Until the appointment of a new Director, the performance of BEPU left
something to be desired. It can only be hoped that the improvements made
since the appointment will be lasting ones.
It may be considered as another institution building aspect of the project
that GJJSs were built with community participation in the construction. The
community contribution to the capital outlay of the seven new CJSSs amounted
to 30 per cent of the total investment. Through these efforts, communities
become much more strongly attached to "t F e i ru schools than had previously
been the case.
7.    Project Sustainabilitv
Risks
The risks have been mentioned above; they concern the brigades training
scheme more than the other project components.
Sustainability
As the communities' commitment was one of the factors determining the
location of the CJSSs, it seems certain that under normal circumstances the
schools will be adequately sustained.
8.    Bank Performance
Main Strength
The main strength of the Bank's performance lay in the close working
contacts maintained throughout the project implementation period. This
continuity in cooperation permitted that minor problems could be ironed out
on the spot on the occasion of supervision missions. A certain flexibility on
the part of the Bank with regard to the re-allocation of funds should also be
considered as an asset, even if this did not go as far as the Government would
have wished.

Performance during Identification/Preparation/Appraisal
It would appear that the one weakness of the Bank relative to this project
was in the project design: the inclusion of relatively "minor" items (BTC/BIAC
and IDM) necessitated a disproportionate workload.
Performance during Supervision
Supervision missions were, of course, charged with supervising all ongoing
education projects of the Bank. Hence, it is not possible to discern exactly
the time devoted to the supervision of the Second Education Project. Never-
theless, it would seem that the supervision contributed substantially to the
successful implementation of the project.
Main Lessons
For the benefit of future Bank projects in education in Botswana, it is to
be hoped that the close and intensive working relationship between the Bank
on the one hand, and the Government on the other, could be maintained even
under the auspices of the re-organization of the Bank. The Completion mission
is not in a position to say whether this constitutes a "lesson to be learned".
9.    Borrower Performance
Main Strengths and Weaknesses
The strength of the Botswana Government relative to the project was the
determination to advance education in the country as a necessary means to
achieve progress and betterment for the people. A weakness lay possibly in
the ambiguities shrouding, for some time during project implementation, the
status of the brigade training scheme, and the policy regarding the employment
of  expatriate  staff  for  BEPU.    Weaknesses,  however,  were  relatively
unimportant compared with the major strength mentioned.
Performance during Project Preparation
In close cooperation with, and assisted by the Bank, the Government through
its various entities played a very positive role in the preparation of the
project, even if preparation did not always go into such details as would be
needed eventually for speedy project implementation.
Performance during Project Implementation
In view of staffing difficulties and other constraints imposed on BEPU as
a consequence of unforeseeable developments (e.g. modification of exchange
rates, drought with negative economic consequences, ambiguities of brigade
status), BEPU performed overall in a satisfactory manner, although project
implementation was de1.ayed.



9
Project management for the youth brigades was placed under the National
Brigades Coordination Committee (NBCC), the administration of which was weak
both centrally and individually. In addition, implementation of the brigades
component was delayed while the policy review of the brigade scheme was in
progress.
Main Lesson
The main lesson would no doubt be that a strong and efficient unit for the
implementation of externally financed project is a necessity. Unfortunately,
it does not follow from such a statement, h o w  this can be achieved.  It
might be suggested that the Government and the Bank discuss between them
possible ways to better integrate BEPU into the overall structure of the
Ministry of Education.
10.   Project Relationship
The difficult problem which had to be confronted in the frame of
Government-Bank cooperation was that of reallocating funds that remained
unspent. Of course, the Government did not agree with the arguments advanced
by the Bank to justify the refusal of the request for reallocation. But this
did not prevent a continuous cooperation that was very positive on the working
level, and eventually, a fourth education project was agreed upon between the
two partners.
11.   Consulting Services
Architects and Contractors
Overall, these were satisfactory. Future will show whether in has been
possible to unit the desired economy of construction with the equally
desirable durability of buildings, and low intensity on maintenance.
Technical Assistance
Bank-financed technical assistance was in support of BEPU. The
difficulties experienced here have been mentioned passim. While there were
tensions between expatriate staff of BEPU and the Government, this did not
prevent the experts from delivering professional services of adequate quality.
12.   Proiect Documents and Data
The legal documents pertaining to the project followed the usual pattern.
Their major strength lied in the flexibility so that there was leeway for
subsequent adjustment.
Covenants have been complied with; a detailed statement concerning
compliance will be supplied by the Bank.

Data needed for the preparation of the Project completion report were
obtained at BEPU, at other Government units in Botswana, and at the World
Bank. Changes in the format of reporting rendered the establishment of
coherant time series difficult.
