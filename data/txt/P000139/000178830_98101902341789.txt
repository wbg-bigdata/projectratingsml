LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      Republic of Botswana
Amount:        US$10.0 million
Terms:         20 years repayment including 5 years of grace, 8.25 percent
interest
Project
Description:   The project will expand and improve the network of junior
secondary schools, increase rural vocational training and
provide training for civil servants and public sector per-
sonnel. Major components include: (a) providing of class-
rooms, science facilities, offices and site work for about 11
community junior secondary schools, (b) constructing about 7
new community junior secondary schools, (c) assisting about
7 youth brigade centers and 9 agriculture brigades, (d) expand-
ing the facilities at the Botswana Training Center and the
Institute of Development Management, and (e) providing technical
assistance for specialist services in the Project Implementation
Unit. The project will help Botswana meet its future work
force requirements by expanding enrollments at the junior
secondary level and in institutions providing vocational,
civil service and management training. The project's risks
involve the adequate provision of junior secondary school
teachers, particularly in mathematics and sciences, and
possible difficulties in the formation and operation of the
agricultural brigades.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANA
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Botswana for the equivalent of US$10.0 million to help
finance a second education project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including five years of grace, with interest at 8.25 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent "Economic Memorandum on Botswana" (Report No.
1832-BT) was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 20, 1978. An
updating economic mission to Botswana is scheduled for June 1980. Country data
are given in Annex I.
3.        Botswana is a landlocked country in southern Africa sharing borders
with the Republic of South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Rhodesia. The country,
although the size of France, has only about 766,000 persons, three-quarters
of whom live in a relatively small eastern corridor. The Kalahari Desert
covers about two thirds of the country. Rainfall is highly erratic,
and Botswana is subject to frequent droughts.
4.        Historically, livestock is the country's principal resource and
cattle raising is still the dominant economic activity for almost 80 percent
of the population.  Starting in 1971, however, the exploitation of Botswana's
substantial mineral resources has spurred economic growth and has significantly
reduced the economy's formerly exclusive dependence on livestock. Fueled by
diamond, nickel, copper and beef exports, real GDP has grown at an average rate
of 10 percent annually during the 1970s and is expected to continue to grow at
a high level of seven to eight percent over the next decade. GNP per capita,
estimated at US$620 in 1978, has more than doubled in current prices since
1974. Although the economy has suffered in recent years from political
turmoil in southern Africa, the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, and below
average harvests, overall growth has remained strong due to the substantial
increases in mineral production. The value of Botswana's diamond production
alone has tripled between 1977 and 1979, and diamonds now account for over 50
percent of total exports.
5.        Since 1972/73, the Government's financial position has continued to
strengthen and the Government has managed to achieve recurrent budget sur-
pluses each year and to remain a net creditor of the banking system. These
surpluses have covered about one half of steadily growing capital expenditures,
which in earlier years had been fully financed from external sources. With



- 2 -
rising income from the Southern African Customs Union, direct taxes and
minerals, the Government's recurrent revenues rose from P 29 million in
1972/73 to an estimated P 175 million in 1979/80. Although about one-quarter
of the 1978/79 actual expenditures had to be diverted to unexpected contingency
projects (related to political events and the cattle disease) the Government's
financial position overall has not yet suffered, since revenues grew faster
than expected and additional foreign grants were provided by bilateral and
multilateral sources. Similar emergency expenditures in 1979/80 were pre-
dominantly financed from a special contingency fund to avoid further disrup-
tion of the Government's planned development budget. Since 1973, the economy
has also shown overall surpluses in its balance of payments, and in June 1979
net international reserves had reached about US$217 million, equivalent to
about seven months of estimated 1979 imports. The remarkable increase in
reserves reflects a rapid rise in exports, sharp increases in government
transfer receipts and substantial inflows of private capital related to
investment in a new diamond mine. Rising prices for oil, petroleum products
and imported food, exacerbated by a small depreciation of the Pula (which
is pegged to the US dollar), placed upward pressures on domestic prices in
1979. To moderate inflation the Government revalued the Pula in September
1979 by five percent.
6.        The country's rapid growth since independence often has diverted
attention from its vulnerability to external developments. The uncertainty
stemming from political events in southern Africa has adversely affected
not only internal and external security, but also the Government's attempts
to diversify sources of revenues, export earnings and private investment.
Moreover, Botswana has no control over an essential part of its transport
system. The rail link connecting Botswana with South Africa and Rhodesia,
which is crucial to Botswana's livestock and mining sectors, is owned by the
Rhodesian Railway Company. In addition, the dominance of livestock and mining
makes for considerable openness in the economy and subjects it to sharp swings
as prices and accessibility to export markets fluctuate. Finally, periodic
droughts and cattle diseases have created personal hardships for a significant
number of Botswana's population.
7.        Despite significant progress over the past several years, insuffi-
cient physical infrastructure and shortages of technical and professional
work force still hinder Botswana's development. During the 1970s, about
14 percent of total expenditures were spent to expand and improve the primary
and secondary school systems, higher-level education, and the vocational
and technical training programs. Although some progress has been made as
evidenced by the increase in the adult literacy rate from below 20 percent at
independence (1966) to about 35 percent in 1978, Botswana's economy remains
heavily dependent on expatriates. They account for about 70 percent of
employees with university degrees and the demand for skilled expatriates
probably will increase further with the economy's expected growth.
8.        Like other African countries dominated by livestock or mining,
Botswana also faces difficulties in reducing economic and social imbalances
that often accompany rapid growth. The traditional pattern of cattle owner-
ship, communal grazing practices and control of watering points have favored



- 3 -
a limited number of Batswana. A 1974/75 rural income distribution survey
revealed that 45 percent of rural households own no cattle at all, another 20
percent own fewer than 10 head, while five percent own about half the cattle.
This inequality in ownership has steadily widened as the size of herds expanded
and competition for grazing land and water increased (exacerbated by periodic
droughts which have eliminated some small cattle owners). The expansion of
herds also increasingly threatens to seriously damage or destroy the grazing
lands through overuse and erosion. To alleviate these ills, the Government in
July 1975 adopted a new "Tribal Grazing Land Policy" designed to reform the
prevailing land tenure system, modernize ranch management and thereby increase
productivity. Moreover, the Government recently started to implement an
Arable Land Development Program to expand employment opportunities in rural
areas, to decrease dependency on food imports and to raise farm incomes and
bring them more in line with incomes from urban employment.
9.        Botswana's development strategy aims at rapid economic growth,
more equitable income distribution, equal education and employment oppor-
tunity and diversification of external economic and trade relations. The
Fifth National Development Plan (NDP V), which covers the period 1979-85 but
has not yet been published, will be built around these goals. While focusing
on employment creation, it will give priority to increasing productivity in the
rural areas, promoting industrial activities, improving the educational system
and expanding further the country's physical infrastructure. The core public
investment program proposed for NDP V amounts to about US$425 million in 1979
prices, implying an average annual investment of 14 percent of GDP, excluding
expenditures for contingency projects (railway and airport development) and
security measures which Botswana may have to carry out over the Plan period.
Real GDP growth, projected to average seven percent annually, is likely to
remain below the target level in the plan's early years due to the achievement
of full capacity in the mining industry, the dampening effect of oil price
increases, and the uncertain prospects for the livestock industry. However,
investment for a large new diamond mine is underway, and once it is operational
in 1982, Botswana's average real growth should exceed seven percent for the
remaining plan period.
10.       Multilateral and bilateral agencies have extended substantial
assistance to Botswana on highly concessional terms. The Bank Group has been
the main multilateral source, but the European Economic Community, the African
Development Bank and OPEC sources have also been active in Botswana. Bila-
teral assistance has come from diversified sources and, in 1978, almost
two-thirds of Botswana's outstanding debt from bilateral sources was converted
into grants. At the end of that year, total external debt outstanding and
disbursed amounted to US$120.7 million. Debt service payments during 1978
were US$8.2 million implying a debt service ratio of 3.4 percent. Botswana is
expected to continue to receive most of its external assistance from bilateral
sources on grant or highly concessional terms given its vulnerability to
geopolitical developments in southern Africa. But, given Botswana's improving
creditworthiness, an increasing proportion of the country's external financing
will come from commercial sources (mainly for mining investment) and some
hardening in the overall terms of Botswana's borrowing is expected. In 1978,
Botswana negotiated its first commercial loan from a consortium of private
banks and the country is expected to remain creditworthy for substantial



external borrowing. Based on projected export growth and a moderate hardening
in the terms of its borrowing, Botswana could borrow an estimated US$80
million annually through 1985 without its debt service ratio exceeding five
percent.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOTSWANA
11.       Botswana has received 15 loans and credits totalling US$110.6
million--six credits (US$14.9 million) and nine loans (US$95.7 million),
including US$3.5 million on Third Window terms. These have financed four
road projects, two livestock projects, two urban projects, two water supply
projects, plus projects for education, a development finance company (Botswana
Development Corporation--BDC), and engineering studies and infrastructure for
the Shashe mining complex. IFC's first operation in Botswana, a US$362,500
equity participation in BDC, was approved in March 1979. Summary statements
of Bank Group Operations in Botswana are provided in Annex II.
12.       As of December 31, 1978, the Bank Group's share of Botswana's
external debt (disbursed only) was 46.4 percent (the share of IBRD alone was
33.6 percent) and accounted for 82.9 percent of its debt service payments, a
reflection of the predominance of loans on favorable terms in Botswana's
external debt. About 80 percent of debt service payments to the Bank Group,
however, are for the Shashe infrastructure loans which are guaranteed by a
consortium of international mining companies. The Bank Group's share of
external public debt (disbursed) and debt service payments in 1985 is projected
to be about 24 and 29 percent, respectively.
13.       Overall, the Botswana Government and its agencies have demon-
strated good performance in the planning and execution of development proj-
ects. Bank-assisted projects have encountered relatively few problems with
two exceptions: the Shashe copper/nickel mining project (Loans 776-BT and
776-2-BT) and the IDA-financed first livestock project (Cr. 325-BT). Although
the Bank-assisted infrastructure component of the Shashe Project was completed
on schedule, the mining operation has experienced technical and financial
problems since its inception. The company (BCL) has now resolved most of its
problems and achieved its annual rated production. In 1978, the various
parties concerned agreed to new financial arrangements to give increased
financial support to the company while ensuring the Government would continue
to receive substantial royalties, taxes and dividends. A recent strike (now
settled) at the company which processes BCL's semi-refined metal production,
plus substantial future investment requirements at the mine location, have
raised questions about BCL's future financial viability. The project's
sponsors, its major lenders and the Government have agreed on contingency
financing arrangements to sustain BCL in the short term while longer-term
restructuring proposals are reviewed. The first livestock project has experi-
enced problems with several of its cattle ranches. Fencing of large areas in
the Kalahari region has proved complicated, and the boreholes serving these
ranches have operated poorly. In addition, the project's financial objectives
were affected by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in northern Botswana in
1977. The Government has adopted some measures to resolve the project's
technical problems and has taken steps to halt the spread of foot-and-mouth
disease, but it is unlikely the project will meet its financial objectives
when completed.



-5-
14.       The Bank's future operations in Botswana include proposed projects
in the transport, industrial, and power sectors. A proposed fifth highway
project now being prepared would improve road maintenance and expand the
secondary road system. The Bank plans to continue assisting small- and
me.dium-scale enterprises by providing a second line of credit to the Botswana
Development Corporation. Finally, feasibility studies have begun for a
large, coal-fired power station to meet Botswana's future power requirements.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
The Role of Education in Botswana's Development
15.       At independence in 1966, Botswana had no public education system;
about 66,000 students were enrolled in private primary schools and another
1,300 were in classes at the secondary level. Missionary societies and
a lirmiited number of private local groups provided formal training and educa-
tion based on a curriculum emphasizing arts and literature. In the ensuing
period, the Government has placed the highest priority on improving and
expanding the education system with notable results: net enrollments now
stand at about 80 percent (146,000) of the primary school age group (6-13
years) and about 20 percent (16,000) at the secondary level (14-19 years).
Of existing enrollments in the formal education system in 1978, females
represented about 55 percent at the primary level, 56 percent at the
secondary level, and 33 percent at the university level.
16.       At present, the structure of education is similar to that of
various African countries and provides for a seven-year primary education
course, followed by a junior secondary course of three years leading to
the Junior Certificate and by a senior secondary course of two years leading
to the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate. There are also various small
post-secondary courses in institutions such as the National Center for Voca-
tional Training (recently renamed the Botswana Polytechnic), the Botswana
Agricultural College, the Botswana Training Center, the primary teacher
training colleges and the University of Botswana and Swaziland. In addition,
a number of institutions provide accelerated training and non-formal educa-
tion; of these, the most important are provided by the department of non-formal
education and the youth brigades. The growth of the education system has been
slow and uncoordinated, partly because administrative responsibility was until
recently divided among several ministries, parastatals and private agencies.
Furthermore, the legacy of the system's origins was reflected in the heavy
emphasis placed on arts and literature and the comparatively low priority
given to scientific and practical subjects.
17.       As a result, the education system fails to provide the work force
required for the expanding modern sector of the economy, causing critical
shortages in positions requiring managerial experience, scientific training
or practical skills. In the Government service alone, almost 70 percent of
the 1,220 jobs that require a degree or diploma are either held by expatriates,
or are vacant. Because shortages of local graduates have become so severe
the Government recently established a rationing system which in effect puts
a ceiling on the number of local graduates the public sector can hire. This



- 6 -
system seeks to ensure that some local graduates will be available for employ-
ment in the parastatals and the private sector.
Government Policy and Objectives
18.       In 1975, the Government, aware of the inadequacy of its educational
program, commissioned a review of the sector by a team of international
experts. Their report, completed in April 1977, was accepted by the public
following intense debate, and subsequently, its recommendations were incor-
porated in a Government "White Paper" and approved by Parliament. In January
1979, the Commission reconvened to provide further guidance on the priority
and rate of implementation of its recommendations as well as on other related
programming matters. It reaffirmed the recommendations of the earlier report,
especially the need to develop low-cost, day junior secondary schools to
realize the goal of a nine-year universal basic education course by 1990. The
Commission also restated its position that practical subjects should not be
introduced into the primary curriculum per se but rather should be integrated
into the regular basic science and mathematics courses.
19.       On the basis of the National Commission's recommendations and the
"White Paper," the Government has set the following objectives for education
in the Fifth National Development Plan (1979-85):
(a) to increase educational opportunities and reduce inequalities
as far as resources permit;
(b)  to contribute to the balanced development of the country by
seeking to satisfy work force requirements for all sectors;
and
(c) to promote personal qualities such as respect for national
ideals, self-reliance and concern for other people and to
encourage the full development of individual talents.
To achieve these objectives, at the primary level, the Government plans
to consolidate primary and junior secondary education into a nine-year program
of basic education available to all students the by 1990's. As a first stage,
seven years of universal primary education will be provided to the 6-13
age group by the early 1980s, tuition fees for primary students will be
eliminated and pre-service and in-service teacher training expanded. At the
secondary level, the Government intends to increase enrollments by 50 percent,
to localize junior secondary school examinations and to establish a training
college for junior secondary teachers. Government policy also calls for
reformulating the curriculum to enable the acquisition of basic knowledge and
skills needed in a rapidly changing society and economy, and for introducing
new education programs to emphasize part-time learning and out-of-school
education.
Sector Organization
20.       Responsibility for primary, secondary, non-formal, vocational and
higher education lies with the Ministry of Education (MOE), which overall
accounts for about 95 percent of total enrollments in education and training



- 7 -
institutions. MOE oversees education sector planning, curriculum development,
and teacher training and is responsible for supervising public school admini-
stration and applying government regulations in private schools. The Rural
Extension Coordinating Committee, an inter-ministerial body under the leader-
ship of the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, coordinates the
Government's non-formal education programs.
Issues in the Education Sector
21.       Of the major issues facing education development in Botswana, the
most significant relates to the large and widening gap between the demand
and supply of educated manpower. The country's rapid economic growth has
exceeded the capacity of the education and training system to provide educated
workers, leading to the high degree of reliance upon expatriates in the
public and private sectors, and the large numbers of unfilled posts requiring
technical experience. The shortage of trained personnel extends beyond the
degree or diploma level. Interviews with employers and other studies have
revealed that almost 75 percent of the workers in parastatal and private
organizations employed in commercial, clerical or administrative positions
required vocational training, but only 25 percent had received it. The
Government's educational programs in the Fifth National Development Plan
provide an appropriate response in quantitative terms to the country's work
force shortages. The proposed expansion in the primary system and increased
secondary school enrollments are justified by existing shortages and future
employment demands for the local labor force. Programs to increase enroll-
ments at the Botswana Training College, the Polytechnic and the youth brigades
will address growing employment needs at the crafts and technician levels.
Despite these efforts, Botswana's strong mineral-led economy should continue
to grow rapidly, thereby placing increasing demands on the school system for a
qualified local work force.
22.       A second issue, with serious implications for the Government's
expansion programs, has been the education system's inability to maintain
quality during a period of rapid growth. Quality problems have resulted
from the serious shortages of certified teachers, science classrooms, labora-
tories, and equipment that have plagued the formal education system at all
levels. As a result, academic performance at the primary level has been poor,
repetition rates high, and about one-third of the school leavers are barely
literate. Secondary school leavers fare little better; their pass rate has
shown a long-term downward trend, especially in math and the sciences. The
Government recognizes the serious decline in quality of its education system
and has adopted measures to upgrade curriculum and improve teacher supply. In
the immediate future, the Government will seek additional bilateral assistance
and will increase direct recruitment of teachers from outside Botswana.
Longer term programs include construction of a teacher training college,
expanding the enrollments at existing teacher training institutions and
increasing in-service training programs. In other areas provisions will be
made for additional science classrooms and laboratories, improvements to the
curriculum and a localized examination system.

Bank Experience and Strategy in the Sector
23.       The first Bank-assisted education project (Loans 1274-BT/1275-T-BT),
approved in May 1976, provided US$10.5 million to (a) increase the number of
secondary school places by 30 percent; (b) provide additional secondary school
teachers; (c) expand adult education programs; (d) assist the expansion of the
youth brigades program; and (e) provide a rural education development center
(Matsha Community College) to serve the needs of the western Kalahari region.
While implementation proceeds well and the project should be completed on
schedule in 1982, several lessons have been learned. Mostly these relate to
problems with staff shortages in the project implementation unit and the need
to improve the evaluation of the brigades program. These issues have been
addressed in the design of the proposed project.
24.       The Government's policies for educational development are sound and
meet Bank criteria for assistance to the sector. In the area of primary
education, the needs are mostly qualitative and are being catered to prin-
cipally under projects assisted by bilateral agencies. Given the high level
of primary enrollments (80 percent) the Government should be able to achieve
its goal of providing nine years of basic education for all Batswana children
by the 1990's. The major bottleneck in the education system exists at the
secondary level where output falls short of work force requirements, partic-
ularly in vocational areas. Building on past experience, the Bank will
continue to help Botswana strengthen and expand its system for secondary
education, and will assist certain well-defined programs in the non-formal and
technical/vocational education subsectors.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       The proposed project was identified in January 1978, and prepared
by the Government with assistance from the Bank. Appraisal followed in
May/June 1979, and negotiations were held in Washington in February 1980.
Mr. B. Caiquo, Acting Director of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance
and Development Planning, led the government delegation. A Staff Appraisal
Report is being circulated separately; Annex III provides supplementary
project data.
Project Objectives and Description
26.       The proposed project will:  (a) help to develop a network of
community junior secondary schools; (b) expand rural vocational training,
especially for primary school leavers; and (c) improve training of civil
servants and public sector personnel in management skills, accountancy,
public finance and commerce. The project will achieve these objectives
by:
providing a program of assistance for existing and new
community junior secondary schools;
continuing the assistance provided under the first education
project for youth brigades; and

Botswana Training Center.
Project Details
Community Junior Secondary Schools
27.       One of the Government's major educational objectives in the Fifth
Plan period (1979-85) is to expand junior secondary enrollments to accommodate
at least half of all primary school leavers. Botswana has two types of
junior secondary schools: (a) government and aided schools (about 67 percent
of enrollments) which receive direct government capital assistance and techni-
cal services; and (b) community junior secondary schools (about 33 percent of
enrollments) which depend largely upon the local community for capital assist-
ance, receiving only technical services from the Government. Originally small
towns and villages that had no secondary schools in their locales established
and operated their own community schools. Gradually, as its budgetary re-
sources permitted, the Government has provided more assistance to these
schools and intends eventually to absorb them within the public school system.
Given the high cost of school construction, the Government plans to emphasize
development of community junior secondary schools, as these depend upon
substantial private contributions from local citizens and cost less per
student to construct and operate than government and aided schools. At
present, there are 16 community junior secondary schools enrolling 5,150
students. The proposed project will (a) help improve about 11 existing
schools by providing science laboratories, classrooms, administrative offices
and site development; and (b) assist the construction of about seven new
schools. Improvements to the existing schools will increase educational
opportunities for about 3,850 students, while the new schools will provide
about 1,680 additional student places.
28.       The actual locations of the new community junior secondary schools
will depend on how the local communities respond to the Government's incentives,
which include professional services, provision of some teachers and general
financial support. Communities expressing interest will be required to
comply with educational regulations concerning curricula, student:teacher
ratios, fee structure, facilities design, and financial and managerial policies;
demonstrate commitment to the funding of the school and its future efficient
running as measured by the community's general financial standing and record
on local projects; and be willing to locate the school in catchment areas
sufficiently large enough to attract students from all socioeconomic strata.
The selection of the communities will be based on the above criteria which
have been discussed and are acceptable to the Bank. The major constraint on
the efficient utilization of the new community junior secondary school facil-
ities is the shortage of certified teachers, particularly in mathematics and
sciences. The Government appreciates this problem, and has presented a plan,
acceptable to the Bank, demonstrating how it expects to meet the expected
shortfall in qualified teachers. Initially it will recruit additional expa-
triate teachers and has already received new commitments from several bilateral
sources and voluntary assistance agencies. Over the longer term, Botswana's
existing teacher training facilities will be enlarged to provide a sufficient
supply of qualified Batswana teachers. The Government has also provided



- 10 -
assurances that an adequate number of suitably qualified teachers will be made
available to staff the facilities to be provided in the proposed project
(Section 4.06, draft Loan Agreement).
29.       At present, community junior secondary schools chargp fees which in
general are higher than those charged by government secondary schools.  While
this is understandable given that the community schools are presently financed
substantially by private resources, nonetheless it creates the potential
problem that qualified students could be excluded on grounds of affordability.
To ensure that this situation does not occur, the Government has provided
assurances it will, in consultation with the Bank, progressively equalize the
levels of fees charged by community junior secondary schools with the national
level of fees charged by government secondary schools, and extend its existing
bursary scheme to apply to students attending the community junior secondary
schools to be assisted under the project (Section 4.07, draft Loan Agreement).
Youth Brigades
30.       The proposed project continues the assistance to the youth brigades
similar to that provided under the First Education Project (para. 23). The
brigades were developed over the past ten years as a means of providing skill
training for primary school leavers. The system is voluntary; the trainees,
both boys and girls, undergo three years of on-the-job training, their work
and resultant products generating much of the resources needed to maintain the
brigades. The brigades originate through local initiative; each brigade
teaches a particular skill (carpentry, building, dressmaking, farming, motor
mechanics, forestry, weaving, etc.), and several brigades in a locality join
for administrative purposes into a youth brigade center. In 1978, there were
16 brigade centers housing 60 brigades with about 1,280 trainees. The brigade
centers consist of a collection of very modest buildings built by the trainees.
Each center is governed by a Board of Trustees made up of interested local
residents. Every proposal for a new brigade activity is reviewed by the Board
and, if approved, the proposal is forwarded to the National Brigade Coordinating
Committee. Government financing of a new brigade proposal is dependent upon
the Committee's approval. This method of project approval assures control
over the creation of brigade centers and additions to exsiting centers. It
also ensures that all new brigade activities are originated and approved by
the local community.
31.       The proposed project will help expand the brigade program by provid-
ing about seven brigade centers and about nine agricultural brigades. The
National Brigade Coordinating Committee will determine the locations of
the new facilities after appropriate preliminary preparation has been done by
the local communities, including formation of a Board of Trustees. To ensure
the necessary coordination between the brigades and other agricultural activ-
ities in Botswana, the Ministry of Agriculture has established a post for a
full-time agricultural specialist to act as a liaison officer between the
Ministry and the agricultural brigades. Assurances have been given that a
specialist will be recruited for the position by September 30, 1980 (Section
3.04, draft Loan Agreement).

32.       In 1976, a tracer study was made of the 1,300 brigade trainees
who had completed courses since 1965. Of the 450 who responded to the
questionnaire, 83 percent of them had found work within six months after
completion of training, and 80 percent of those employed were situated in
jobs related to the skills they had acquired. While the results of the
1976 study are sufficiently encouraging to merit continued assistance to
the brigade movement, further evaluation efforts will be undertaken by
the National Brigade Development Center to determine the long-term direction
of the Youth Brigade Program. These efforts will include strengthening and
institutionalizing the present evaluation program and submitting a report to
the Bank on the brigades' activities within three months of the end of each
fiscal year.
Botswana Training Center
33.       The Botswana Training Center (BTC) began operating in 1962, training
lower-and middle-level civil servants and public sector employees in admini-
stration, accounting, bookkeeping, shorthand and typing.  In 1978, BTC re-
ceived a UNDP technical assistance grant of about US$1.3 million to help
expand its activities over a four year period.  The UNDP project provides for
25 staff years of technical assistance, six fellowships, equipment and vehicles
monitoring and technical review. Its objectives are to introduce two new
courses, one in commerce and accounting and the other in public finance and
accounting, as well as to raise the standard of secretarial training to enable
graduates to fill secretarial positions in the private, parastatal and public
sectors. When fully operational by the end of 1980, BTC will have the staff
and educational programs to accommodate up to 120 students, compared with the
present enrollment of 75. To provide for these enrollment increases, the
proposed project includes classrooms, seminar rooms, a typewriting room and
administrative offices. For women students living outside Gaborone and
attending BTC, the proposed project includes a 40-bed hostel.
Institute of Development Management
34.       The Institute of Development Management (IDM) was established in
1974 as a largely autonomous regional institution within the University of
Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. Following the withdrawal of Lesotho from the
University in 1975, IDM, on the recommendations of its Advisory Board and with
the approval of the three governments, became a separate regional body under a
Governing Board. IDM provides courses, seminars and workshops designed to
help middle-and senior-level personnel gain a fuller understanding and com-
petence in performing their responsibilities. Over IDM's five years of
operations, about 110 courses have been conducted with nearly 2,000 partici-
pants from the public, parastatal and private sectors. The courses offered
include general administration and management, financial management, personnel
management, as well as special topics in education, health services, agriculture,
rural development, local administration and related fields. At present, the
facilities at Gaborone are inadequate to meet the expanding requests for
courses, not only from students in Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, but also
from the other African coutries. Consequently, the proposed project would
provide classrooms, seminar and library rooms, and administrative offices to
accommodate the projected expansion of courses over the next four years.

Project Cost and Financing
35.       The total project cost is estimated at US$15.0 million equivalent,
including duties and taxes amounting to about US$0.4 million equivalent.
About US$9.6 million equivalent, or 65 percent of project cost, will be for
expenditures on goods and services outside Botswana. The proposed Bank loan
of US$10.0 million equivalent will cover approximately all foreign expenditures
with the balance financed by the Government.
Project Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation
36.       The Project Implementation Unit (PIU), established at the time of
the First Education Project, will be responsible for the administrative and
financial control of the proposed project. Technical assistance provided in
the project will finance the services of a procurement manager, an assistant
architect, an assistant quantity surveyor, and two clerks of works. Each
appointment to the staff of the PIU financed out of the proceeds of the
proposed loan shall be a person whose qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank. To permit the PIU
to adequately control and monitor the implementation of the project components
dealing with brigades and community junior secondary schools, assurances were
given that the Board of Governors of the community junior secondary schools
and the Brigade Trusts, seeking assistance under the project, will prepare
project memoranda proposing in detail the facilities and services to be
constructed, installed or provided; the contributions to be made by the
community or the Brigade Trust; the site location; the capital expenditures to
be financed; the construction, installation and procurement procedures to be
followed; the proposed utilization of such facilities; the financial and
economic justification for the proposals and such other information as may be
required (Section 3.01(b) and Schedule 5, draft Loan Agreement).
37.       The Planning Section of the MOE, in cooperation with the Central
Statistics Unit, is currently planning tracer studies of primary and secondary
school leavers and brigade leavers. In addition, both the youth brigades and
the IDM are in the process of developing more comprehensive evaluation systems
for their respective programs. To ensure that the proposed project is properly
monitored and evaluated, the Government has given assurances that it will
(a) provide semi-annual reports on project implementation; and (b) not later
than three months after the loan's closing date, prepare a report evaluating
the execution and initial operations of the proposed project, its costs and
the benefits, the performance by the Government and the Bank of their respec-
tive obligations under the Loan Agreement, and significant lessons learned
during project implementation (Section 3.06, draft Loan Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursements
38.       Contracts for civil works, furniture, equipment and vehicles will be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank Group's guidelines for procurement, except as follows: (a) civil
works for the brigade centers and agricultural brigades; (b) civil works



- 13 -
contracts costing less than US$250,000 equivalent each; and (c) contracts for
furniture, equipment and vehicles costing less than US$50,000 equivalent each.
Item (a), listed above will be carried out by the departmental forces of the
brigades utilizing force account procedures. Based upon experience in the
first project, this has proven to be an economic and efficient method given
the remote rural locations of the brigades. The cost of this work is estimated
at US$3.4 million equivalent including contingencies. Items under (b),
estimated to cost US$2.1 million equivalent, and items under (c), estimated to
cost US$0.6 million equivalent, will be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures satisfactory
to the Bank. Civil works, furniture, equipment and vehicles to be awarded
under international competitive bidding are estimated at about US$6.6 million
equivalent including contingencies. Sketch designs, draft tender documents
and master lists of furniture, equipment and vehicles indicating proposed
grouping and cost estimates will be reviewed by the Bank. Items will be
grouped to the extent practical to encourage competitive bidding and permit
bulk procurement. Review of tender evaluation documents prior to award will
be required only for contracts above US$250,000 equivalent for civil works and
US$50,000 equivalent for furniture, equipment and vehicles. Domestic manufac-
turers of furniture and equipment will be allowed a preference of 15 percent
or the existing rate of import duties, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f.
price of competing foreign suppliers.
39.       The proposed Bank loan will be disbursed on the basis of:  (a)
62 percent of total expenditures for civil works (including construction
materials for the community junior secondary schools and force account work
performed by the brigades); (b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for
directly imported furniture, construction materials for the community junior
secondary schools, equipment and vehicles; (c) 90 percent of local expenditures
for locally manufactured furniture and equipment; (d) 80 percent of total
expenditures for imported but locally procured furniture, equipment and
vehicles, and for technical assistance; (e) 70 percent of total expenditures
for professional services; and (f) 30 percent of local expenditures for
operational expenses. All disbursements will be fully documented except for:
(a) work executed by the brigade departmental forces utilizing force account
procedures and (b) operational expenses for project administration for which
disbursements will be made against a certificate of expenditure, the documen-
tation for which is not submitted for review, but is retained by the Borrower
and available for inspection by the Bank during the course of a project
supervision mission. Retroactive financing of up to US$100,000 equivalent is
recommended for design work expenses incurred after January 1, 1980.
Benefits and Risks
40.       The proposed project will expand Botswana's educational system
at the junior secondary and vocational levels and will improve civil service
and managerial training in order to meet future work force requirements.
The project's support of community junior secondary schools will enable these
locally-assisted institutions to expand their enrollments and upgrade instruc-
tion in mathematics and sciences. Because of the community's financial



- 14 -
involvement in these schools, the Government's limited funds will result in
more new student places than otherwise will be possible. The proposed assist-
ance for the Botswana Training Center, the Institute of Development Management
and the youth brigades will enable these institutions to expand their operations
to meet Botswana's growing requirements for local work force w4th clerical and
administrative skills, accounting knowledge and vocational training. The
project's principal risks concern the adequate provision of junior secondary
school teachers, particularly in mathematics and the sciences, and potential
problems in forming and operating the new agricultural youth brigades. To
minimize these risks, the Government has provided assurances that the necessary
teachers will be provided to staff the project-assisted schools, and has
prepared a satisfactory plan for recruiting expatriate teachers to meet
interim shortages while local teacher training facilities are being expanded
(para 28). Regarding the agricultural brigades, adequate measures will be
taken, including recruitment of a specialist in the Ministry of Agriculture,
to ensure the smooth formation and functioning of the new brigades (para
31).

BOTSWANA
C. STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF JANUARY 31 1980
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Credit No. 325: Livestock Development Project; US$1.65 Million
Credit of June 30, 1972; Effectiveness Date: April 10, 1973;
Closing Date: April 30, 1980
The project's status deteriorated during the last 6 months. The
Nojane ranches are overstocked and mismanaged, the water facilities and fences
continue to break down and the extension service has failed to alter tradi-
tional practices. A revised cash flow projection indicates that these ranches
will have difficulty in meeting debt servicing commitments. BLDC continues to
have financial problems due largely to the foot-and-mouth induced curtailment
of trading. Government is aware of the above problems and is discussing pro-
posals to solve them. It also is considering ways to alter BLDC's financial
structure, so that it will be in a viable position to resume trading when the
restrictions are lifted.
Loan No. 1497: Second Livestock Project; US$6.5 Million Loan of
December 30, 1977; Effectiveness Date: November 27, 1978; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
The project is behind schedule mainly due to an eight month delay
in achieving effectiveness. However, sound preparation for all components
has occurred and their implementation should gather tempo for the next six
months. Lease format is finalized and ranches are being allocated prior to
their development. The National Development Bank is ready to solicit and
process loan applications. The Commissioner of Agricultural Management Asso-
ciations is in post and his organization is staffed and processing applica-
tions. The Agricultural Program Research Unit has commenced construction of
the first of its experimental units. The Ranch Management Training Center is
prepared to train its first intake; and project management is satisfactory.
Progress in remodelling the railway livestock handling facilities has been
slow, but the plans have been recently completed and approved by the Rhodesian
Railway Authority.

ANNEX II
URBAN SECTOR
Loan No. 1584: Second Urban Project; US$8.0 Million Loan of
May 10, 1978; Effectiveness Date: June 20, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
Project implementation has begun and is proceeding satisfactorily
following delays in loan effectiveness. Site improvements have begun in
Francistown and will commence shortly in Selebi-Phikwe.
DFC
Loan No. 1019: Botswana Development Corporation Project; US$4.0
Million Loan of June 27, 1974; Effectiveness Date: December 9,
1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
Medium- and large-scale industrial investment activity in Botswana
remains depressed due to political uncertainties in southern Africa and lim-
ited investment opportunities in Botswana. The small-scale enterprise program
is jointly being implemented by Barclays Bank and BDC. Due to the slow com-
mitment of the loan, the subproject submission and closing dates have recently
been extended at BDC's request to December 31, 1981 and December 31, 1983,
respectively.
TRANSPORT
Loan No. 1174: Third Road Project; US$5.8 Million Loan of
November 21, 1975; Effectiveness Date: January 12, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980
Project implementation is about 1-1/2 years behind schedule, due
to the unusually heavy demands on an understaffed Roads Department, delays
over the approval of tender documents, and contractor problems, but progress
in all components is now improving. The construction of Molepolole-Gaborone
road was completed in May 1979. The Highway Maintenance Pilot Study is now
being finalized and the implementation of the study's recommendations should
begin shortly. The Loan Agreement was amended in November 1978 to include
a feasibility study and detailed engineering for a 77 km road and purchase
of traffic counters. These additional components were financed our of
savings estimated at US$1.2 million on the road construction component of
the project.

ANNEX II
Loan No. 1408: Fourth Road Project; US$20.0 Million Loan of
April 21, 1977; Effectiveness Date: August 18, 1977; Closing
Date: December 31, 1981
Progress is satisfactory. Implementation of the Road Maintenance
Program has been delayed by about one year because of delays in finalizing
the maintenance study report and decisions on equipment procurement.  The
Loan Agreement was amended in August 1978 to include construction of 17 km
of road, a feasibility study and detailed engineering of roads in the Tuli
Block area and technical assistance for the Roads Department. The additional
components were financed out of savings estimated at US$5.5 million on the
road construction component of the project.
EDUCATION SECTOR
Loans No. 1274 and 1275T: Education Project; US$10.5 Million
(US$7.0 Million IBRD and US$3.5 Million Third Window) of May 28,
1976; Effectiveness Date: September 10, 1976; Closing Date:
March 31, 1982
Implementation is satisfactory and the project is expected to be
completed with full disbursement of the loan proceeds by March 31, 1982,
the loan Closing Date. Latest cost estimates indicate about a six percent
increase in total project cost. Disbursement is lagging due basically to
the lack of urgency in preparing the necessary documentation. This docu-
mentation is currently under preparation.
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Loan No. 1763: Second Water Supply Project; US$4.4 Million
of January 9, 1980; Estimated Effectiveness Date: May 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The loan is expected to become effective in May 1980. Initial
project implementation is satisfactory.
D. EXISTING IFC INVESTMENTS
Botswana Development Corporation, 448-BT, DFC
IFC has agreed to purchase shares in the Botswana Development Cor-
poration (BDC) and will provide technical assistance to its management by
being represented on BDC's Board of Directors.
