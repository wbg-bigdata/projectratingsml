Growth of Energy Consumption
1.14      Consumption of commercial forms of energy in Indonesia grew in the
recent past at about 13.6% p.a., doubling in about five years. For Repelita
III (FY80-84), growth is projected at 11% p.a., with the share of petroleum
products falling from 90% in 1977 to 79% in 1984. Currently, electricity
provides only 7% of the country's energy, but is projected to increase to
11.3% by 1984. The table below shows a breakdown of consumption by energy
sources:

Organization of the Energy Sector
1.15       In May 1978, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) was
established as part of a general reorganization of government departments to
coordinate all activities in the energy sector. MME has overall respon-
sibility for mining, oil, natural gas and electricty. It controls the state
enterprise b responsible for the execution of the government policies in the
energy subsectors - viz. the national oil and gas entity (PERTAMINA), the
coal agency (BATUBARA) and PLN. The Ministry has been recruiting staff over
the past three years and developing its organization to fulfill its role in
the energy sector.  NME's organization chart is shown in Annex 1.
1.16      GOI has established an interdepartmental energy policy and
planning committee at the technical level. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of
the Committee are the MME's Directors-General of Oil and Gas and of Electric
Power (DGEP), respectively. A permanent energy committee has also been
formed by the Minister and entrusted with the tasks of assessing energy
technologies, dealing with day-to-day energy problems and preparing
long-term projections for demand and supply. A ministerial level National
Energy Board has recently been formed to review proposals emerging from the



-6-
technical committee and eventually to establish a more clearly defined
energy policy with specific implementation instructions to the ministries
concerned
PrLoblems in the Energy Sector: Policy and Pricing
1017      Because of the deficiencies of available statistics on both
resources and consumption a comprehensive energy balance, indicating the
various sources of energy, patterns of transformation, transportation and
consumption has not yet been prepared for Indonesia.  The preparation of a
preliminary balance is within the brief of the Bank's energy sector mission
(para. 1.01), and the exercise is expected to highlight the areas of greatest
statistical deficiency and hence indicate the direction for urgent data
collection efforts. Thus far, therefore, the country has lacked a quantita-
tively based overall energy policy. This policy weakness is compounded by a
system of energy pricing that does not equate rational consumer choices with
the national interest.  In particular, petroleum product prices - subsidized
by Government for political and social reasons - have caused serious dis-
tortions in the economy by failing to reflect their value to the economy as
an export good.  The effect has been to favor the use of oil over other
competing fuels, promotion of domestic consumption over exports, and because
the degree of subsidy between oil products is uneven, to distort the demand
between individual petroleum products.
1.18      The elimination of these subsidies has been under serious
discussion between GOI and the Bank for some time. In the context of
negotiations of Loan 1872 (Power IX), the Government confirmed that, as a
matter of policy, it would ultimately abolish subsidies on domestic oil
consumption, subject to the ability of consumers to pay, and a further step
in this direction was taken in May 1980 when petroleum product prices were
increased 50%.  Nevertheless the prices of most petroleum products except
gasoline are still only at about one third of international levels.  The
ernergy sector mission is examining the economic consequences of these
subsidies, and the Bank has agreed to allocate about US$3.0 million under
Loan 1513 (Power VII Project) for further studies to support the formulation
and implementation of a new pricing policy.
1.19      Loan 1513 would also help to build up a management information
system (MIS) for DGEP activities and ensure that development programs in the
electricity sector are entirely consistent with national policy objectives.
A contract for this study has recently been negotiated with a consultant
selected on the basis of evaluated proposals from a number of firms, and
awaits approval by the GOI Procurement Control Team.
The Electricity Sub-Sector
1e20      The Electricity subsector is regulated by MME through DGEP.  It
comprises (i) PLN, (ii) captive plants installed by private parties for



-7-
their own use, (iii) some small municipal franchises, and (iv) a small
number of cooperatives which were set up to providet electricity in certain
rural areas remote from PLN supply systems.
1.21      Legislation was enacted in 1979 to provide for private and
cooperative franchise participation in the electricity sector with the
intention of providing electricity generation/supply in areas where PLN was
unable to develop its own supply systems fast enough. However, no new
parties have so far been licensed.
1.22      DGEP.  Since its inception in 1978 DGEP has been responsible for
electricity policy in the country. Until its establishment, PLN had been
responsible for giving advice to the Minister on sector policy and for
planning and licensing. Legislation enacted in 1979 transferred these
responsibilities, particularly in policy planning, licensing of franchises,
and general supervision of the sector from PLN to DGEP. Its organization
structure is shown in Annex 1.
1.23      PLN. PLN was first formed in 1961 when three Dutch-owned elec-
tricity utility companies were nationalized, but its growth as an effective
modern organization started around 1972, when its status was changed from
that of a department of a ministry to a public corporation, and foreign
financing became available for its urgently needed rehabilitation and
expansion programs. PLN's subsequent growth has been impressive. It now
has 2.6 million consumers and provides 70% of the total electricity
supply in the country. Further details are given in Chapter 3.
1.24      Captive Plants.  Until the mid-1970s public sector development
was severely constrained due mainly to lack of financing and PLN could not
meet the demand with any reliability. Captive plants therefore grew rapidly
and the total capacity of such plants is currently about 2000 MW compared to
2,610 MW of PLN; most of the plants are small diesel installations, with a
few larger gas turbines. During 1973-76,. the average annual growth rate of
captive plant was 15% (with a peak of 22% in 1975).  Since then the growth
has fallen off rapidly to an average of about 4% during 1976-79 (Annex 2);
it was negligible during 1979/80. This is a direct consequence of the rapid
augmentation of PLN's system supply, significant improvements in reliability
standards, and positive marketing measures. It is PLN's policy, when
connecting owners of captive plant, to allow such plant to remain in use as
reserve until the end of its economic life.  Some captive plants will
continue to be installed as PLN's investment program is not large enough to
meet the entire demand at all locations in the country, but the rate of
growth is likely to remain below 5%.
Rural Electrification
1.25      Rural electrification (RE) is being initiated by PLN with consul-
tancy assistance, among others, from the National Rural Electric Cooperative
Association (NRECA) of the US and financed by USAID, which provided a loan



- 8 -
for seven pilot projects (US$20 million). Financial assistance in the form
of a loan has also been committed by Holland (Fl 15.5 million, US$737 mil-
lion) and as a grant by Finland (FM 0.48 million, US$0412 million). Tlese
pilot projects were conceived wholly on considerations of consumDtive use of
power and did not explore productive uses. This is being rectified in the
implementation stage.
1.26      Rural electrification as defined in Indonesia covers all towns and
villages in the country except provincial capitals and second level provin-
cial towns.  During Repelita III GOI plans to electrify about 3,700 of the                    4
64,000 villages, and specific national budgetary allocations have been made
for this purpose (Rp 60 billion - US$96 million) in FY81 and 82.  indonesia
does not yet have a plan or time scale in which all villages in the country
will be provided access to electricity, but those villages and areas ir.
which electricity would have the greatest economic impact will be given
priority.  GOI policy will be to implement village schemes  Sherever possible
by extensions from the PLN system rather than through isolated diesel
generators, and Java in particular is being treated as an integrated total
network for this purpose because of the contiguity of population centers
throughout much of the island. As the growth of a system base to support RE
is a prerequisite, it will inevitably be some time before the national RE
plan can be significantly enlarged. The Bank supports the GOI approach.
The proposed project provides for the extension of supply into a number of
villages at an estimated cost of US$46 million; about 400,000 inhabitants
will be served.
2. THE POWER MARKET AND THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Status of Surveys
2.01      Several attempts were made during the 1970s to prepare a
meaningful demand forecast for the Indonesian power sector. The only
records of consumption which were available were those of PLN's sales, and
these were unsatisfactory as a basis of forecasting future demand since they
reflected the very low levels of electrification, frequent supply outages,
and extensive use of captive generators which then prevailed. Basic market
research was therefore necessary to establish potential demand, Such a
study was carried out for Java in 1974-76 by consultants financed by IDA
Credit 399, and similar studies are now in progress for the islands of Bali
and Sulawesi.  At negotiations for the Power X project (Loan 1950), PLN
agreed to equip itself to keep these studies updated, and to carry out
similar studies in other islands, with diminishing dependence on consultants,
To improve the quality of its power surveys, PLN also requires the active
association of the DGEP of MME, which should provide guidelines on national
energy policies, firm data on primary energy availability and usage and
pricing policies, as these influence the demand for electricity. The
strengthening and coordination of planning for electricity growth is one of
the principal tasks of the Power Sector MIS study (Para. 1.19),

Present Consumption and Access to Service
2.02      The per capita consumption of electricity in Indonesia is still
extremely low at about 76 kWh (FY81) compared to 570 kWh in Malaysia, 250
kWh in the Philippines and 250 kWh in Thailand. Indonesia's population has
low access to electricity; only about 10% of the households are connected.
The degree of electrification in different regions varies, being about
12.3% of households in Java, 8.6% in Sumatra, 12.0% in Kalimantan, 10.3%
in Sulawesi and 2% to 3% in the other islands.
Demand Projections
2.03      The initial results of the Java study suggested that the magnitude
of the underlying demand was so large that annual growth rates of public
electricity supply would have to be on the order of 30-35% during FY76-85,
compared with historic rates of 10-12%. It was recognized, however, that
PLN's sales in Java could not quickly rise to such levels and that, in the
short and medium term, their growth would depend on the rate at which PLN
could build up its facilities and meet an increasing proportion of the
existing demand. In the longer term, PLN sales would reflect more closely
the growth of the power market itself. Extensive discussion of these
forecasts and their assumptions and methodology took place during the period
1977-79 and eventually agreement was reached between GOI and the Bank on a
series of sales forecasts to be adopted for planning purposes up to 1990.
The development program for electric power incorporated in Repelita III is
based on them. It follows from the foregoing, however, that they are in the
nature of feasible targets for expansion of supply rather than objective
estimates of underlying demand, at least through FY86.
2.04        The energy sales forecasts are summarized below:

Connection Program
2.05      As a necessary instrument of meeting its sales targets, PLN agreed
with the Bank in 1978 that it would prepare and actively implement a
consumer connection program consistent with its improving capabilities. The
results are summarized in Table 2.2 below. Figures in parentheses indicate
the growth over the previous year:

(15.3%)           (17.1%)               (20.5%)
2.06      PLN exceeded its customer connection targets each year from FY78
through FY80, but energy sales grew rather less rapidly.  In FY81 energy
sales growth overtook that of both connections and connnected load, ref lect-
ing mainly the diminishing use of captive plant by PLN's industrial con-
sumers. The result was also influenced by PLN's ongoing loss reduction
program although the effect of this was relatively small.
2.07       In some of the Wilayahs, notably East Java (XII) and North Sumatra
(II), the results of PLN's efforts at expediting consumer connections have
been impressive.  For example, in East Java the growth rates in FY79
through FY81 were 30%, 36% and 33% respectively. These growth rates give
some indications of the extent to which potential demand - at least in
some areas - exceeds PLN's near-term sales targets.  Of more immediate                         #
concern is the fact that such growth rates were ahead of the growth of PLN's
capacity to supply. In particular, the sitution highlights the urgency of
accelerating completion of the EHV (500 kV) Central - East Java link. These
needs are addressed in the formulation of the proposed project (para. 4.07).
The situation in North Sumatra is similar. There is an urgent need for PLN



- 11-
to update its market surveys both in Java and other islands in order to
properly plan the scale and pace of its immediate expansion program. To
sustain the momentum built up during the past 3 years, special efforts
should be made by PLN and GOI to ensure that the targets of expansion of
power supply facilities in Repelita III are achieved by improved monitoring
of construction, and provision of adequate financial resources. At
negotiations for the Power X project (Loan 1950), PLN undertook to improve
its system planning capabilities, to identify emerging system bottlenecks in
advance and to ensure that its power systems continue to be adequate as the
demand escalates.
Development Program
2.08      On the basis of its forecast of power sales, PLN follows the
practice of preparing annually a 10-year development plan to cover the
projected requirements of generation, transmission, distribution and other
facilities. The latest plan finalized in October 1980, covers the develop-
ment period FY81 to FY89. A time slice of the program for the period up to
FY84 has been incorporated in Repelita III. In the past, least cost invest-
ment programs for generation, transmission and distribution were planned
with the help of consultants. PLN has recently developed in-house capa-
bility for carrying out least cost generation planning studies with computer
modelling which is utilized to review and update the Java generation plan.
Java accounts for 59% of Indonesia's population (1980 census) and 80% of
PLN's sales. The development plan has been formulated to achieve the
following objectives: (a) optimize resource utilization by substituting oil
by using coal, by greater exploitation of hydro and geothermal resources for
power generation and by reducing the use of fuel inefficient installations;
(b) realize economies of scale by larger sized installations; (c) achieve
operational economy by coordinating the utilization of plants through inter-
connected operations; and (d) provide acceptable standards of reliability of
supply. The planning process represents a significant improvement over
previous versions, but requires further refinement. In particular, it needs
to be subjected to tests of financial feasibility; this is discussed further
at paras. 5.10-5.12.
2.09      Thus far, planning for the other islands has been done by less
sophisticated methods, and, with the exception of major generation projects,
has tended to take the form of global projections in mainly financial terms.
However, in FY80 the regional offices of PLN were given a significantly
greater role in the development of their plans and a considerable amount
of detailed planning data was assembled. The task of collating this data
in manageable form for computer processing is now in progress, and a signif-
icant improvement in the quality of planning for the other islands is
expected over the next two years or so.

2.10       In terms of growth of generating capacity, PLN's development plan
may be summarized as follows:

/a  Including Jatiluhur.
/b  Including plants to be built and operated by agencies other than PLN.
Within a total generating capacity three and one-half times its present size,
steam plants will show the greatest growth, and will constitute 53% of total
generating capacity compared with 29% now. All new steam plants will be
designed for the possibility of coal-fired operation.  Hydroelectric
capacity will show important growth, and geothermal plants will appear
although on a modest scale.  Diesel generation will be eliminated in Java
but will show some growth in the other islands, chiefly in connection with
RE schemes.
2.11      The cost of this investment program together with associated
transmission, distribution and other facilities is estimated at US$7.4
billion at 1980 prices (non-PLN geothermal stations excluded), with a
foreign exchange component of US$4.5 billion: further details are at
para. 4.03. These totals ignore expenditures to be incurred in the later
years on projects to be commissioned in the 1990s; even so, the program
represents average annual investments of US$900 million.  PLN's recent rate
of capital expenditure was US$530 million in FY80 and just over $800 million                   a
(provisional) in FY81, so the investment program seems realistic in terms of
PLN's capacity to implement it.

3.01      The beneficiary of the propsed loan would be PLN, the
Government-owned national power utility.

Legal Status and Responsibilities
3.02      By Presidential Decree No. 18 of 1972, PLN was constituted a
public corporation (Perum), with responsibility for the generation, trans-
mission and distribution of electricity and the planning, construction and
operation of electricity supply facilities. Until 1979 these responsibili-
ties were exclusive to PLN, but in that year, with the objective of
facilitating the exploitation of electric power to the greatest degree
possible, GOI enacted legislation allowing the intervention of private
entities and cooperatives in the sector under license of MME.
3.03      PLN is required to participate in the national economic planning
process and in the formulation of national power policies.  Financially, PLN
is expected to cover all operatino and raintenance costs (including
depreciation and financing costs) from current revenues, and to generate a
contribution to the financing of its expansion program; the amount of this
contribution has been the subject of a continuing dialogue with the Bank
(para. 5.07).  PLN-s major policies -- including in particular its invest-
ment plans, budgets and tariffs -- are subject to review by a Supervisory
Board chaired by the DGE, and ultimately to approval by GOI. Generally
these supervisory arrangements appear to work smoothly, apart from an
undesirable constraint which is imposed on PLN-s financial management by the
GOI capital budget system: this problem is addressed in para. 5.11.
However, PLN is also bound by a number of procedures affecting all public
sector enterprises; of particular importance are those relating to the award
of procurement contracts set out in Presidential Decrees 10 and 14A of 1980.
There is some evidence that the application of these procedures has caused
delay in the execution of recent Bank power projects. Remedies should be
devised between the Bank and GOI as a country matter through on-going
discussions on project implementation of which the next round is scheduled
for January 1982. At negotiations of this project assurances were received
that GOI will take all necessary steps to ensure adherence to the project
construction schedule agreed with the Bank.
Organization and Management
3.04      PLN's operations are managed by a board of directors headed by a
president director, who is appointed by the President and is accountable to
the Minister of Mines and Energy. The board currently comprises five other
directors with functional responsibility respectively for planning, con-
struction, operations, finance and administration. These directors operate
more in a staff than a line role, since line responsibility strictly
devolves from the board as a whole (following the principle of collective
responsibility) to 16 regional operating managers on the one hand and 12
construction project managers on the other. Regions are responsible for
minor construction work, whereas all major construction work is handled by
construction project managers. PLN-s organization chart is at Annex 2.



- 14 -
3.05      The lines of authority are in practice not as clear as might appear
from the organization chart, and there is some overlapping of responsibility
both amongst the central departments and between the central departments and
the regions/construction projects. For example, construction project
managers are not in a position to take full responsibility for the progress
of their projects since all tendering and contracting is handled by the
Planning department. On the other hand, construction project managers and
the Construction department prepare the capital budgets, manage disburse-
ments and maintain all accounting records relating to individual projects,
so that the Finance department is to that extent unable to exercise full
financial control of PLN's operations. The process of management is also
characterized by the tendency which has developed over past years for Head
Office to exercise control of regions by intervention in their operations in
a degree of detail which causes delay and risks becoming a hindrance to
future growth.
3.06      It is evident that if PLN's growth is not to be hindered by such
organizational constraints, the thrust of institutional development in the
immediate future must be direced towards the rationalization of central
department functions and the concomitant delegation of greater executive
authority to the regions and projects.  To this end, the Minister recently
required PLN to re-examine its structure of responsibility and prepare
revised job descriptions for all senior and middle-level management
positions to eliminate anomalies and in particular to unify responsibility
for all aspects of financial control. This task was be completed by mid-
1981, and is now awaiting Ministerial approval. Beginning in FY83, it is
intended that head office control of regional operations will focus
increasingly on performance as measured by certain key physical and
financial performance indicators, with a consequential relaxation of
detailed supervision. In preparation for a greater decentralization of
management, all first and second level regional managers have attended
management development courses. However, it is recognized that the speed
with which operational responsibility can be fully delegated with safety may
vary from one region to another.
3.07      The Bank has been involved in the formulation of these plans for
institutional development both by consultation and by the provision of
appropriate consultant inputs in various Bank-assisted projects. Those
currently in progress or planned are:
(a) on the recommendation of the Bank, a management audit was
commissioned by PLN and carried out by a local firm working in
association with international management consultants. Their
report contained a large number of recommendations for improve-
ment, and PLN-s president director has set up a working party to
progress consideration of them.  A number of them have already
been implemented, including in particular a decentralization of
the facilities planning functions from Head Office to the regions;



- 15 -
(b)  through the Power VIII project (Loan 1708) the Bank provided
US$2.5 million for the foreign costs of consulting assistance to
improve PLN's construction management systems. This work suffered
considerable delay in abortive contract negotiations and is now to
be treated as an extension of the Power Sector management informa-
tion systems study contract (para. 1.19) to avoid loss of time in
retendering; and
(c)  the proposed project would provide US$0.6 million for the foreign
costs of further management consultancy, which would assist in the
development of performance indicators (para. 3.06) and in setting
up the accounting and financial control systems necessary to
support a more decentralized form of management. Draft Terms of
Reference for this assignment have already been substantially
agreed between PLN and the Bank and appear at Annex 3. The
assignment is estimated to involve about 45 man-months of
expatriate services at an average rate of $11,200. Other measures
necessary to strengthen PLN's system of financial planning are the
subject of assurances obtained at negotiations and are described in
more detail at paras. 5.12-5.14.
By these means the Bank-s continued involvement iin PLN's institutional
development is assured, and supervision missions will monitor the timely
introduction of the organizational changes and their effectiveness in
operation.
Present Facilities
3.08      Until the early 1970s, PLN's expansion was severely restricted
because of the lack of foreign exchange in the country. A crash program
resulted in gas turbines being preferred; currently they comprise about 30%
of the total capacity. The imbalance in plant is being corrected with the
commissioning of 1,000 MW of new steam capacity by 1982 and PLN's planning
is now based on the least cost program of system development for Java.
Similar programs are being developed for the grids located in the other
islands.
3.09      PLN operates over 6,000 km of transmission lines at 70 and 150 kV
and about 47,000 km of distribution lines, the bulk of which are in Java.
About 2,000 km of 150 kV transmission under construction are scheduled for
completion by 1982. Java will have a fully interconnected grid at 150 kV by
1983. By 1984, a 500 kV system linking West and Central Java will be
commissioned. PLN intends to extend the 500 kV system to East Java by 1985.
Manpower and Training
3.10      PLN now has a total staff of about 32,000 of which about 21,000
are on the permanent payroll. The rate of growth has averaged 10% in recent
years. PLN experiences no difficulty in recruiting at levels up to technical



- 16 -
high school, but difficulty is encountered in recruiting graduates; PLN
sponsors 30-40 scholarships annually to help assure a supply of such
graduates. Currently PLN plans its staffing only on a year-to-year basis,
but it has recently requested Electricite de France, who acted as training
consultant to PLN during the early 1970s, to review manpower planning and
personnel development arrangements. Its report is expected in November
1981. If appropriate, the Bank's twelfth power project in FY83 will include
a suitable training component.
3.11      Six training schools are run by PLN throughout the country to
provide vocational courses for the staff; about 1,100 attend the various
courses each year. Staff members are sent abroad for advanced and other
training not available in Indonesia. Project oriented training,
particularly in foreign financed projects, is also provided.
3.12      PLN does not have adequate training facilities for the operation
and maintenance staff for steam power stations. About 40 people have been
trained in the USA with the assistance of Black and Veatch International
(BVI), the Project Consultants for the Muara Karang and Semarang steam
stations.  A similar training program is also being arranged for the
operation and maintenance staff for the Suralaya project. To provide more
advanced training needed, Power IX Project (Loan 1872) contains a provision
for the establishment of a thermal station training school including a
simulator replacing the existing facility at Tanjung Priok. It will be in
operation by mid-1983.
Research
3.13      PLN has established a power research institute which includes a
high voltage testing laboratory. The institute, which conducts applied
research in power associated areas, has a staff of 278, including 87
graduates.
Accounting and Audit
3.14      PLN prepares its financial statements according to generally
accepted accounting principles and normal utility practice. Assets in use
are revalued from time to time according to indices published by the Minis-
try of Finance, and annual depreciation charges are revised accordingly.
The last revaluation was carried out in FY80. PLN's accounting system was
installed by consultants in the early 1970s and, while it has generally
served the company's aeeds well, there is increasing evidence that it is due
for overhaul. With the expansion of PLN's operations and the proliferation
of accounting units, preparation of financial statements is increasingly
delayed by cumbersome and time-consuming procedures. Furthermore, the trend
towards increased decentralization of management functions will call for
some restructuring of the system so that adequate financial information is



- 17 -
available to local managers in a timely manner.  These problems will be
addressed in the management consulting assistance to be provided under the
proposed loan (para. 3.07).  The same assignment will also review the
desirability of extending the use of computer facilities in accounting and
financial control systems.
3.15      Audit of PLN-s accounts by the Directorate General of State
Financial Control is prescribed by PLN's charter. The Directorate General
follows the standards of the International Accounting Standards Committee
and the International Auditing Guidelines of the International Federation of
Accountants and their audit reports are acceptable to the Bank. In the
1981 audit they plan to introduce a management audit component into their
program which will examine the efficiency of PLN's operations and systems as
well as the accuracy of its accounting.  PLN also has an effective internal
audit group reporting to the president director which carries out various
special investigations in addition to keeping general accounting matters
under review.
Insurance
3.16      PLN carries motor vehicle insurance, and transit and marine
insurance on equipment and materials in transit.  Fire and other hazards are
self-insured. In view of the geographical spread of PLN's assets, any
single loss would be relatively small by comparison with total assets and
operations, and this policy is therefore considered satisfactory.
Performance Under Earlier Bank Operations
3.17      The Bank has provided US$1,139 million for power generation/distri-
bution facilities in and around Jakarta and in West and Central Java. Three
distribution projects (Credits 165 and 334, and Loan 1259) rehabilitated and
expanded the distribution facilities in the greater Jakarta area. They also
enabled some major institutional, organizational and financial reforms to be
carried out in the electricity subsector, including providing PLN with a new
charter giving it substantial autonomy. Seven power generation projects
(Credit 399, and Loans 1127, 1365, 1513, 1708, 1872 and 1950) in West and
Central Java were undertaken to help PLN expand electricity generation
capacity in Java and to optimize its utilization by constructing a 500 kV
transmission link from West to Central, and eventually to East, Java. Past
loans and credits have also provided funds for various consulting services
such as the large management consulting effort of SOFRELEC, the Java System
Development Study undertaken by PCR, and feasibility studies for thermal,
hydroelectric, transmission and distribution projects.
3.18      A completion report on the first two projects (Credits 165 and 334)
was issued in November 1979. It describes how, after an initial period of
difficulty and delay (the two projects were completed some three and a half



- 18 -
years behind schedule) many institutional and operational improvements were
effected, greater reliability of supply was achieved, and PLN's sales began
to increase rapidly. Lessons learned from these operations were applied to
subsequent operations. A specific program for financial recovery, designed
to improve PLN's management capabilities and to overcome its financial
weaknesses over time was incorporated in Credit 399 and was accomplished
ahead of target during FY76.
3.19      PLN's performance in implementing the 10 Bank-assisted power
projects was uneven at first, but there was significant improvement until
the introduction of new GOI procurement procedures during 1979/80 (para.
3.03). The earliest generation project (Credit 399) covering the first and
second 100 MW units at Muara Karang thermal station was completed about two
years behind schedule; the next (Loan 1127) for the third 100 MW unit, had a
delay of less than one year. Subsequent generation projects at Muara Karang
(Loan 1365) and Semarang (Loan 1513) are about 4-6 months behind appraisal
schedule; two projects at Suralaya (Loans 1708 and 1872) are also a few
months in arrears. Loan 1950 for the Saguling hydropower plant has only
recently become effective. The record of implementation of agreements
reached in connection with these operations has been satisfatory
3.20      There are quantitative indications of PLN's steady improvement in
performance in other areas. Its system losses, as high as 27% in FY75, were
down to 25% during FY79 and less than 22% in FY80.  The generation per
employee increased from 240 in FY75 to about 340 during FY80. There is
still scope for considerable improvement.
4. THE PROJECT
Objectives
4.01      The main objectives of the project are to:
(a) increase PLN's transmission and distribution capacities;
(b) enable grid extensions to be made to rural areas; and
(c) provide consultancy services for schemes which will enhance
the use of coal, develop an effective grid system and continue
PLN's institutional growth.
Project Description                                                                         '
4.02      The project comprises:
(a) a distribution system for Jakarta and the regencies of Bogor,
Tangerang and Bekasi (Jabotabek) in West Java involving
construction of about 450 km of 20 kV cables, 760 km of 20 kV



- 19 -
overhead lines, 1,336 sub-stations and 800 pole-mounted trans-
formers, about 5,300 km of new low voltage lines and some
320,000 service connections;
(b)  a high-voltage (HV) system, complementary to (i) above,
involving five new sub-stations in Jakarta, 46 km of double-
circuit 150 kV cables and 980 MVA of transformers;
(c)  engineering of the next base-load coal or multiple fired thermal
power units in Java;
(d)  engineering of the Extra High Voltage (EHV) Central-East
Java transmission line; and
(e)  management consultancy for further improvements in PLN's
financial planning and control systems.
PLN-s Transmission and Distribution Program
4.03       The project forms part of PLN's development program (paras. 2.08-
2.13) for the period 1982-1989, of which 37% (US$2.7 billion at 1980 prices)
is for Transmission and Distribution. Of this about $1.4 billion is
required for the short term (1982 to 1985) to meet the most urgent needs.
The project is a part of this immediate program.  PLN is also preparing a
detailed transmission and distribution scheme for Java and major demand
centers in Sumatra and Sulawesi to meet longer term needs up to 1990. The
study financed by loan 1365 (the Bank's sixth lending operation to the
electricity sector) will be completed by the end of 1981.  These schemes are
essential for achieving GOI's energy policy objectives of shifting to coal
and hydro-electric resources for electricity generation (para. 1.02) and
rapid electrification.
Evolution of the Project
4.04       Reinforcement and expansion of the distribution system of the City
of Jakarta - a densely populated (5 million) urban center covering 200 sq km
- was carried out under the Bank's first two lending operations. Its
completion was followed by the fifth operation (Loan 1259 of 1976) for
extension of the distribution system to about 2,800 sq km of Jabotabek,
which will be completed in 1981. Part (a) of the proposed project is
intended to extend electricity supply to both urban and rural areas of
Jabotebek's 5,700 sq km (with a population of 10 million) and represents a
continuation of the Bank's development efforts in an important area of PLN's
operations which accounts for about 40% of its electricity sales. In 1979
SOFRELEC of France, the engineer associated since 1970 with the
rehabilitation and expansion programs mentioned above, carried out a



- 20 -
feasibility study of the requirements of the region during the period
1982-1990. The distribution expansion component of this project (Part (a))
is based on the SOFRELEC report prepared early in 1980.
4.05      SOFRELEC also pointed out the need for reinforcement of the 150 kV
high voltage system in the Jabotabek region to meet the growth of demand.
PLN has in the past been primarily responsible for planning and implementing
schemes of high voltage system expansion and it has done this successfully
using consultants only in some areas of specialization. The project compon-
ent described in para. 4.02(b) is based on detailed system studies carried
out by PLN and covered in its March 1981 "Report on reinforcement of the
Jabotabek H.V. system during 1982-85."
4.06      Part (c) of the Project is a further step in implementing the
country's energy policy of utilizing coal instead of oil for electricity
(para. 1.02) which began with the Suralaya Thermal Power Station project
(ultimately 3,100 MW) under implementation in West Java with Bank assistance
through loans 1708 and 1872. Two units, each of 400 MW, are currently under
construction at Suralaya. PLN is studying the feasibility of installing a
third unit of 400MW at this site by 1987. A feasibility study to establish
a similar (ultimate 4000 MW capacity) site in East Java was initiated as
part of the Bank-s seventh operation in the electricity sector (Loan 1513)
and is now nearing completion. A site near Tuban has been chosen. The
first generating set at Tuban (400 MW) is required to be commissioned in
1987. To achieve this detailed engineering has to commence early in 1982.
GOI has requested Bank financing for the purpose. During negotiations an
assurance was obtained from the Government that sources of coal for the
next base-load coal, or multiple-fired thermal power units in Java will be
identified by mid-1982, and that arrangements for mining and transport of
coal required will be implemented in time for their commissioning in 1987.
4.07      The first steps towards development of an effective grid system
in Java at 500 kV were taken during the Bank's eighth and ninth operation.
An 800 km line extending from West to Central Java is under construction,
scheduled for completion during 1983-84. The 300 km extension to East Java
is required by 1985. GOI has decided to use bilateral financing sources for
construction but has requested that the Bank finance the engineering
primarily to ensure uniformity in approach on the features of the EHV grid.
Part (d) of the project provides for this. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that GOI and PLN will take all necessary steps to construct the
Central-East Java EHV line by 1985.
Cost Estimate
4.08      The project cost estimate is detailed in Annex 4 and summarized
below. The cost estimate has been prepared by PLN, and is considered
reasonable:

from material and construction costs for ongoing transmission and distri-
bution projects at levels prevailing in November [980. Physical contingencies
of 5% have been allowed for. Price contingencies were estimated as follows:
on foreign costs at 9% for FY82, 8.5% for FY83, and 7.5% for FY84 and 85;
and on local cost at 18% for FY82, 14% for FY83 and 10% for FY84 and 85.
Financing Plan
4.10      The financing plan for the project will be as follows:
US$ million
Bank                                 170.0
Government sources and PLN           149.4
Total                           319.4



- 22 -
As in previous operations the Bank loan would be made to GOI which would
relend the proceeds to PLN on similar terms. Signature of a subsidiary loan
agreement to this effect would be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan.
Engineering and Construction
4.11       The detailed engineering of Part (a) of the project (the distri-
bution component) covering preparation of bid documents, evalation of bids
and supervision of construction will be carried out entirely by PLN which has
now acquired the necessary experience. The construction organization built
up during the past few years will be adequate for this project. The mile-
stone schedule is at Annex 5. Bid documents for the first lot of equipment
have been prepared by PLN and reviewed by the Bank. No major problems are
foreseen in the construction of this part of the project but progress will
have to be monitored by the Bank, particularly on procurement, as PLN will
be undertaking work entirely on its own for the first time.
4e12       The 150 kV high-voltage component (part (b) of the project) will
be implemented by PLN with the assistance of consultants in some specialized
areas as in the past (para. 4.05). The West Java Transmission Project unit
was set up for PLN's ongoing construction program of 150 kV transmission
lines, cables, and sub-stations (including the first two gas-insulated sub-
stations). It will be responsible for construction of Part (b) of the
proiect. The unit has a dynamic experienced manager, and a nucleus of
supporting staff. Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR) of the UK now acts as the
consultant to this unit. PCR started this role in 1976, when PLN drew on
funds under the Bank's credit TA 451 for assistance in planning for procure-
ment through bilateral sources, using export credits. Later, PCR's assis-
tance was arranged through British Technical Cooperation and for supervision
of construction up to end 1981. PLN has established a joint project team
with PCR, including six specialists with counterpart staff and it is working
satisfactorily. The same organization pattern will be used to execute the
new project.  PLN proposes to use PCRs services on the same lines.  The Bank
had no objection to this arrangement and PLN has started to mobilize the
required consulting services immediately to meet the construction schedule.
4.13      The cost estimate for PCR-s engineering services (para. 4.12)
covers 360 man-months at an average man-month cost, including basic salary,
overheads and fee, international travel and overseas allowance for resident
field engineers of US$10,000. It is based on rates and costs prevailing at
present.
4a.4       Land is required for construction of the five new substation sites
at Kebonjeruk, Karet, Senoya, Mampang and Kemang (all in Jakarta) and right
of way for the cable routes. In view of its importance for timely com-
pletion of the project, acquisition of land and obtaining necessary right
of way were made conditions of Board presentation.



- 23 -
In September 1981 DKI gave PLN the right of way for the cable routes and PLN
acquired the new substation sites.
4.15       Under this project, it is proposed to carry out the work of the
detailed engineering of the next base-load coal or multiple fired thermal
units up to the stage of preparation of bid documents.  This is estimated to
require about 400 man-months of expatriate effort at a man-month cost of
about US$8,000. The estimate also provides for about 128 man-months of
local consultants at an average cost of about $1,500.
4.16       PLN proposes to use consultants primarily for construction super-
vision of the EHV extension project. About 70 manr-months of expatriate
effort will be required at a cost, inclusive of international travel and
mobilization, of US$820,000. The average man-month cost is about $7,000.
The local cost, including use of local consultants, is expected to be about
US$200,000.
Procurement
4.17      All equipment and materials to be financed from the proposed
loan (other than poles for the distribution expansion project) will be
procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
guidelines. As some participation by Indonesian manufacturers is likely a
15% preference on the c.i.f. price, or prevailing duties, if lower, will be
applicable. For economy it has been proposed that the procurement of con-
crete poles be arranged through local competitive bidding in accordance with
GOI procedures. Adequate competition is expected from recently established
and growing local industries to obtain prices which are expected to be
significantly lower than the alternative of importing either steel or
concrete poles under ICB.
Disbursement
4.18       The Bank loan will be disbursed as follows:
(a) equipment (except poles) - 100% of foreign expenditures
for directly imported goods, 100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory) for locally manufactured goods and 65% of the
total expenditures for imported goods procured locally;
(b) concrete poles - 80% of the expenditures, representing the
estimated indirect foreign cost; and
(c) consultants services - 100% of expenditures.
The schedule of disbursement of the Bank loan is at Annex 6. It is based on
the recent experience under the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1259) - a similar
project.



- 24 -
4.19      The project is expected to be completed by December 1985 and the
closing date for the loan would be June 1986.
Ecology
4.20      No environmental problems arise in connection with the project.
In congested areas the 150 kV system and the medium voltage system will be
underground. The 150 kV substations will be of the compact gas-insulated
type appropriate in such locations and medium-voltage transformers will be
located in kiosks. In less congested areas both the medium-voltage and low
voltage systems will be overground.

5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Results
5.01       PLN's operations have expanded rapidly throughout the last decade,
and energy sales tripled between 1971 and 1980. During the last five years
the rate of growth accelerated; energy sales increased from 3,100 GWh in
FY76 to over 6,400 GWh in FY81, and for the last three years the rate of
growth has exceeded 20% per year.
5.02       From FY76 through FY80 PLN's tariff was held constant and its
revenue grew proportionately to the growth in energy sales. In net income
terms, the corporation averaged a breakeven result over this period./l A
new rate schedule was introduced effective May 1, 1980 (para. 5.06) which
has had the effect of lifting average revenue per kWh sold from Rp 27 to
about Rp 42.  On this basis net earnings of Rp 10 billion are estimated for
FY81, and the interim results at midyear (available at appraisal) suggest
that the estimate for the year will be achieved safely.
5.03       Around FY75, PLN's investment program began to accelerate rapidly
from its previous low level, and since FY78 capital expenditure has been
running at about twice sales revenue. With negligible net income, PLN's
only sources of internal funds have been depreciation retentions and
customers connection fees, which amounted to 21% of capital expenditures
over the last five years. GOI provided the rest of the funds required,
mainly in the form of equity capital, though since 1978 the onlending of
finance from international lenders has formed an increasing proportion of
GOI funding to PLN.
5.04       Income statements, funds flow statements and balance sheets for
the last five years are at Annex 7.
Present Financial Position
5.05       PLN-s estimated balance sheet at March 31, 1981 may be summarized
as follows:
/1 FY80 results subject to audit.

Long-term debt                                 346
2,192
Since loan financing is a relatively recent innovation for PLN, the debt:
equity ratio stands only at 17:83, which leaves the company conservatively
leveraged to sustain a high level of borrowing for capital expenditure. The
current ratio is 4.7, and with current assets including Rp 100 billion in
cash the company's liquid position is satisfactory. The level of receiva-
bles has given some cause for concern in the past, but as a result of the
adoption in 1980 of a more rigorous policy towards delinquent debtors the
average length of credit has been reduced from 94 to 68 days. While still
too high, this measure reflects mainly the long delay in settlement of
certain public accounts; discussions are presently in progress between PLN
and the concerned authorities to try to improve payment procedures. At
negotiation of the Power IX Project (Loan 1872), it was agreed that GOI
outstanding accounts will be reduced to two months' billing by March 31,
1982; the covenant is be repeated in the proposed loan.



27
Tariff
5.06      PLN's tariff comprises about 20 consumer classes.  For all except
the smallest domestic class, two-part charges are applied, and for
industrial and the largest commercial consumers time-of-day pricing is in
effect. Provision is made for a cost surcharge, variation of which requires
the Minister's approval; alteration of the basic rate requires Presidential
approval. When the present rate schedule was introduced in May 1980 it
represented the first deliberate step towards marginal cost pricing, and
the Bank was extensively consulted in its preparation. Further refinement
will be necessary before this objective is fully achieved, in particular as
regards the relative weighting of the demand and energy charges, which in
the present structure tends to understate the effect of fixed costs on power
pricing. Such adjustments will be incorporated in the next review of
tariffs, expected to be called for in FY83 (para. 5.08).  The power tariff
is also economically inefficient insofar as it reflects the subsidized
prices at which PLN buys its fuel oil (para. 1.17); this issue must be
addressed in the context of GOI's overall energy pricing policy (para. 1.18).
Future Financial Performance
5.07      In 1977 PLN and the Bank agreed that a level of contribution to
capital expenditures from internally generated funds was suitable as a
measure of financial performance. At negotiations for the Power VIII
Project (Loan 1708) this was set at 30% (on a 3-year moving total basis)
which was to be achieved by FY86; this agreement was repeated in the loan
documents for the Power IX Project (Loan 1872) and Power X (Loan 1950).
Indicative targets for the intervening years have also been the subject of
discussion and revision from time to time between PLN and the Bank; the
latest ones are:
FY80 through 82              12%
FY83 through 84              20%
FY85                         25%
5.08      PLN achieved a contribution rate of 20.2% in FY80 and 18.3% in
FY81, thus exceeding its target for each of those years. Financial
projections show that the target for FY82 can also be comfortably met (a
rate of 17.9% is forecast) without any increase in average revenue per kWh
sold. A tariff change is therefore not anticipated during this year,
especially in view of GOI's declaration in its FY82 budget statement that
energy prices should be held stable for the year. However, achievement of
the indicative targets for FY83-85 and the covenanted level for FY86 will
require an increase in PLN's tariff estimated to average 20% in real terms.
In the financial forecasts, this has been assumed to become effective
towards the middle of FY83.



- 28 -
5.09      Around 1986, PLN is expected to enter a period in which its unit
costs will decline gradually (1-2% per year) in real terms. The factors
contributing to this include, in particular:
(a)  the expected impact of the loss reduction program;
(b)  increased efficiency of operation in Java on completion
of the EHV transmission line; and
(c)  increasing economy of operation in some of the systems
outside Java as a result of scale.
These considerations suggest that for the remainder of the 1980s, PLN's
requirements for increased unit revenues can be secured by use of the
surcharge, and that average revenues may therefore be allowed to advance at
rather less than the rate of cost inflation without prejudice to the
achievement of the target contributions to capital expenditure. In terms of
operating income, this would represent a rate of return (on fully revalued
net fixed assets in operation) of around 8%. Forecast financial results of
PLN for FY82 through FY87 are at Annex 8.
Financing Plan
5.10      According to its constitution, PLN is authorized to borrow from
local and foreign lenders, and to issue its own obligations. In practice,
the remainder of PLN's investment program which is not financed from
internal cash generation is presently funded exclusively by GOI. Local
currency expenditures are customarily reimbursed to PLN in the form of
equity contributions; foreign exchange expenditures have been funded partly
as equity and (increasingly) partly by the onlending on similar terms of
finance secured by GOI from overseas lenders. These arrangements have
generally worked well enough in the past, but with the increasing scale of
PLN's funding needs (para. 2.13), a number of aspects are beginning to give
cause for concern. The most important are summarized below, together with
the measures which are now proposed to address them.
5.11      The project budgeting (DIP) system through which PLN obtains its
capital funds from GOI involves approval of expenditures on a project-by-
project basis in advance of the beginning of each fiscal year. Two
important features of this system are that the insertion of new projects
during the year, and the redeployment of funds from one project to another,
while technically permissible are in practice difficult and time-consuming.
PLN's flexibility to deal with unforeseen contingencies and to accommodate
divergencies between planned and actual project progress, is to this extent
constrained. This constraint has contributed to the underspending of
capital budgets which has occurred regularly in past years. To overcome it,



- 29 -
PLN has built up a liquid position (currently about Rp 100 billion) which it
intends to use in part to cover any hiatus that might occur in project
progress as a result of DIP constraints.  PLN is considering augmenting its
available funds for this purpose through occasional bond issues on the
recently-established Indonesian capital market.
5.12       With the assistance of Bank personnel PLN has recently developed a
capability for financial forecastinig using computer models. However, this
system does not at present interface with the development program planning
system (para. 2.08), nor is the development program routinely tested for
financial feasibility. PLN's investment program is now of such a size that
its financial implications must be reviewed with equal care with the
technical and economic considerations, and a judgment made of the feasi-
bility of the proposed investment in terms of the requirement for capital
funds, and the level of revenues necessary to meet associated operating
costs.
5.13      PLN then needs to develop a financing strategy which will give it
the greatest assurance of the availability of funds for its capital program.
GOIs commitment of funds is limited to the fiscal year's budget, whereas the
lead time for many of PLN's projects is 4-6 years and its overall investment
planning period is 10 years. In consultation with the Bank, PLN is currently
engaged in an exploration of the extent to which it could prudently increase
its debt: equity ratio over the next few years.  Once this exploration is
complete, and a system of financial forecasting and evaluation is integrated
into the planning process, PLN will be in a position to draw up a financing
plan which should form the basis of agreement on medium-term financing stra-
tegy between PLN and GOI.
5.14      At negotiations, assurances were therefore obtained:
(a)  from PLN that it will:
(i)  institute as part of its annual planning procedures for FY83
and subsequent years, the preparation of a 10-year financial
forecast based on its proposed development plan;
(ii)  test each proposed development plan for financial
feasibility;
(iii)  develop a financing plan covering the first 5 years
of the forecast period which will specify the quantum
of external funding and the appropriate mix of equity
and debt, and, to the extent possible, identify
potential sources of the latter;



- 30 -
(iv)  ensure that its recommended development plan and
associated financial forecast and financing plan are
jointly reviewed and adopted by its board, and provided
to and discussed with GOI and the Bank;
(b) from GOI, that it will review with PLN its development plan and
associated financing plan, and take appropriate measures to
facilitate access by PLN to the sources of finance it requires.
6. JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The distribution system in Jabotabek presently comprises the old
12 kV system in Jakarta and the 6 kV system of Bogor, and the newer 20 kV
systems developed through the Bank-s first, second and fifth operations in
the electricity sector. The total installed capacity of these substations
early in 1980 was about 1056 MVA, which includes 230 MVA of the old system.
The peak load on the system was about 530 MVA. Assuming a diversity factor
of 1.3 and 80% loading the maximum capability of the system is estimated
at 650 MVA.
6.02      On completion of the fifth power project (Loan 1259) the total
installed capacity of the Jabotabek distribution system will be about 1640
MVA in 1982 and the corresponding system capability will be about 1010 MVA.
The review of the growth of demand carried out by SOFRELEC during its
feasibility study indicates that the peak demand on the system would be
about 1000 MVA by the end of 1983. Thus, unless additional substation
equipment is installed and energized, the Jabotabek system will be subject
to overloading in 1983, with all the consequences which have hampered growth
of public electricity supply in the past. Studies have established that
approximately 300 MVA of new capacity will have to be added in 1983 and
about 700S MVA in 1984-1985 to meet the expected growth of demand in the
area.
6.03       The system capability analysis described above includes the
capacity of the older. 12 kV and 6 kV networks.  On these, losses are heavy
and reliability is poor. SOFRELEC had recommended that these networks be
eliminated by 1985.  This project will not however attempt to do so as it
was felt that these systems could be useful at reduced loadings for a few
more years, and that extension of service to new areas deserves higher
priority in the use of restricted finances. The question would be reviewed
during the ongoing comprehensive study of overall transmission and dis-
tribution requirements of Java and main demand centers in other islands
(para. 4.03) and, if justified, adequate provisions could be made for the



- 31 -
purpose under the next Bank operation scheduled for FY83 which will also
cover PLN's transmission and distribution requirements.
6.04       Proposals for reinforcement of the 150 kV high voltage system to
meet the additional demands of the Jabotabek area have been finalized after
carrying out power flow studies and considering available alternatives
which narrowed down to two. The proposed project component was chosen
because of marginally lower costs and greater flexibility for future
expansion. The proposed sub-station capacity of about 980 MVA is consistent
with the expansion program of the distribution system.
Economic Rate of Return
6.05       In projects involving transmission and distribution networks where
it is usually difficult to assess the benefits attributable to the expansion
programs, and where the schemes represent an area and time slice of a total
development program, it is customary not to attempt a separate economic
analysis, and to utilize instead the economic rate of return of the entire
program. In the case of the Jabotabek transmission and distributiion
project, PLN and SOFRELEC have made an analysis of the supply situation with
and without the project and have established that PLN's sales would increase
by about 700 GWh in 1984 to about 3000 GWh in 1990 and beyond. On the
basis of these, and other assumptions set out in Annex 10, the economic rate
of return has been calculated as at least 18%. It is a minimum measure of
the benefits as PLN's revenues have been used as a proxy for benefits and
consumer surpluses have been ignored.
Risks
6.06       There are no risks of any significance associated with this trans-
mission and distribution project.
7. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01       Earlier covenants with GOI and PLN which were consolidated in the
loan documents of Power Ten (Loan 1950) - except those which were project-
specific - will be repeated in the documents for the proposed loan. Specific
new agreements reached during negotiations of the proposed loan are:
(a) Government agreed:
(i) to take all necessary steps to ensure adherence to
the project construction schedule (para. 3.03);



- 32 -
(ii) that sources of coal for the next base-load coal or
multiple-fired power units will be identified by mid-1982
and that arrangements for mining and transport of coal
required will be implemented in time for commissioning of
these units in 1987 (para. 4.06);
(iii) to review PLN's medium-term financing plan in
association with its development plan, and facilitate
access by PLN to appropriate sources of finance
(para. 5.14);
(b)  Government and PLN agreed that they will take all necessary
steps to construct the Central-East Java EHV line by 1985
(para. 4.07);
(c)  PLN agreed:
(i) that it will institute financial forecasting as part
of the annual planning process, and test its development
plans for financial feasibility;
(ii) that it will prepare each year a five-year financing
plan for review by GOI and the Bank (para. 5.14).
7.02      Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and PLN will
be a condition of effectiveness.
7.03      Agreement having been reached on the above, the project forms a
suitable basis for a loan of $170.0 million to GOI for a period of 20 years,
including 5 years of grace, at interest rates prevailing at Board
presentation.

PERUSAHAAN UMUM LISTRIK NEGARA
Sugested Terms of Reference for Management Consulting Assistance
1.        Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara (PLN), the state electric enterprise
of Indonesia, wishes to retain the services of a suitably qualified
consultant to assist with the development of certain aspects of its
accounting, budgeting and management information systems. The need for these
developments has arisen partly as a result of the growth in scale and
geographical distribution of the corporation's operations, which now require
the updating of certain of its systems, and partly through the evolution of
its management structure, which calls for a review of the financial reporting
and control' arrangements. A brief description of the corporation and its
operations is attached to these terms of reference;/1 a statement of the
responsibilities of the various levels and locations of management will be
provided to the consultant at the beginning of the assignment.
2.        Consultants retained by the Government of Indonesia are already
working on the design of an overall MIS for the power sector in Indonesia,
of which PLN forms an important part. The consultant appointed for the
assignment described in these terms of reference will be expected to
familiarize himself with the recommendations of this consultant to the
extent they affect his work.
Objectives of the Assignment
3.        The principal objectives of the assignment are to:
(a) speedup the preparation of annual and interim financial statements;
(b) improve financial control of certain aspects of PLN's operations,
including in particular capital project expenditures and Wilayah
operating results; and
/1 To be provided by PLN.



-36 -                             ANNEX 3
Page 2
(c) ensure that financial reports provided to managers are appropriate
to their needs and focussed on matters requiring their attention.
Preparation of Accounts
4.        Under the present arrangements, Wilayahs report their trial
balances to Pusat each month.  Corporate financial statements are prepared
from detailed consolidations performed at Pusat. This procedure has now
become too cumbersome and time consuming, and is complicated by the
difficulty of achieving a clean cutoff of data at closings and consequential
problems in reconciling inter-office current accounts. The consultant is
required to recommend a way of shortening and simplifying the task of
financial closing, with the goal that financial statements (for each Wilayah
and for PLN as a whole) should be available within [4 weeks at interim
closings and 8 weeks at the yearend]. It is recognized that staff
constraints may preclude the immediate adoption of the recommended solution
throughout all Wilayahs, but implementation should be effected in at least
[one] Wilayah and a program developed for implementation in the others.
Financial Control
5.        Currently the principal instrument of financial control is the
annual budget. However, with the growth of the corporation the maintenance
of budgetary control by Pusat in the present amount of detail has become
cumbersome, and is beset by the same kind of administrative difficulties as
accounting. In addition, PLN's management now wishes to supplement the
budgeting system with additional controls which will focus on key aspects of
financial performance. The consultant is required to assist management to
develop and refine the financial control system so that:
(a) budgets are prepared, maintained, and updated in the degree of
detail, and at the location, most appropriate to the maintenance of
effective control;
(b) performance indicators are established for each responsibility
center to measure the effectiveness of that center in achieving its
objectives under the corporate plan, and are monitored and reported
to the appropriate levels of management.
6.        The control of construction projects presents particular problems.
The present accounting system does not readily permit the allocation of
expenditures to individual projects; as a result, expenditure control,
reforecasting of cost to completion, and determination of values to be
capitalized and depreciated, have become difficult and are effected largely

ANNEX 3
Page 3
outside the accounting system. It is desired that these (and related)
functions should be integrated with the accounting system and carried out
under proper accounting controls to the extent possible.  In this connection
it should be noted that PLN has retained consultants under separate contract
to assist with the improvement of construction management in general; the
consultant appointed under these TOR will be required to maintain close
liaison with that consultant, and will be invited to participate in the
formulation of his recommendations on those aspects of his assignment which
interfce with the accounting, budgeting and management information systems.
Reporting
7.        The consultant should review the system of financial reporting in
PLN and prepare proposals for improvement. His proposals will take into
account the statements of management responsibility provided to him at the
beginning of the assignment, the structure of performance indicators
proposed, and the enhanced reporting capability of the accounting system.
The following basic principles should guide the formulation of reporting
requirements:
(a) reports should be accurte and presented in a timely manner;
(b) they should reflect a level of detail appropriate to the recipient;
(c) they should focus on matters of concern to the recipient, and
indicate clearly those on which decision or action is required;
(d) budgets, plans and forecasts should be revised when significant
events make realization of the current ones unrealistic.
8.        In the context of reviewing the accounting, budgeting and financial
reporting systems the consultant is required to comment on the adequacy of
the present arrangements for recording and transmitting data within PLN.
Detailed evaluation of computer hardware and software is not required at this
stage, but the consultant will be expected to indicate clearly the nature of
any system changes which seem to him to be necessary, and indicate order-of-
magnitude cost involved in implementing them.
Scope of Work
9.        In all the above aspects of the assignment, the consultant is
required to:
(a) investigate the existing arrangements;



- 38 -
ANNEX 3
Page 4
(b) develop proposals for improvement consistent with the objectives
described above;
(c) implement the accepted proposals, including where appropriate, the
design of forms and reports, specification of coding systems/charts
of accounts, and preparation of procedure manuals or instructions;
(d) train the concerned staff - accounting and other - in revised
procedures, and make managers fully conversant with the form,
content, purpose and use of any new reports.
10.       The implementation requirement is subject to the limitations
mentioned above for Wilayah accounting arrangements, and for computer
hardware and software.
Assignment Organization
il.       PLN will appoint [a senior financial manager] to be principally
responsible for providing a formal channel of communictions with PLN's top
management and coordination with other consultants working on related
assignments, to provide the consultant with technical briefing, to articulate
PLN's responses to the consultant's recommendations, and to provide logis-
tical support to the consultant at the working level.  Details of day-to-day
working arrangements will be worked out when the assignment commences.
Timetable and Reports
12.       It is envisaged that work on the accounting system, budeting
systems and management reporting will be carried out largely in parallel,
and on this basis an elapsed time of not more than 12 months is allowed for
the assignment.
13.       The key reporting dates envisaged during the assignment are as
follows:
end fourth month: proposed changes to
(a) accounting system
(b) budgeting system
end fifth month: proposed system of financial control and
structure of reports
end eighth month: recommendations on data storage, transmission
and processing.

Page 5
14.       A period of review and consultation will follow the submission of
each of these reports, in which PLN will decide on the recommendations to be
adopted for implementation. In the case of accounting, budgeting and
financial reporting, implementation and training will be completed within the
overall assignment time limit. Written material ancillary to implementation
(procedures, manuals, etc.) are to be completed by the consultant during that
time.

Assumptions for the Financial Forecasts
General
1.        Period of the Forecasts is through FY87.  The latest investment
program of PLN does not (as in previous years) include global estimates
of expenditures to be undertaken in the late 1980s in respect of projects
to be completed in the 1990s and which have not thus far been costed in
detail. Therefore, financial forecasts for years oeyond FY87 would be
misleading by virtue of the understatement of capital expenditures.
2.         Inflation has been taken into account at the following rates (%):
CY81   82   83    84    85    86   87
Offshore costs                9   8.5  7.5   7.5   7.5    6    6
Local costs (exc. fuel)    18  14   10    10    10          10   10
Fuel costs                    -   -   30    10    10        10   10
Income Statements
3.         Revenues assume a tariff increase of approximately 60% (20% in real
terms) in FY83. Thereafter use of the surcharge facility is assumed to
maintain a self-financing ratio above 30% for the rest of the period.
4.        Fuel/Bulk Power is derived directly from the planting schedule.
Power produced at geothermal plants is assumed to be bought by PLN from the
agency responsible for generating it.
5.        Operating Expenses have been forecast in detail taking into account
the facilities expected to be in use each year, and subject to local cost
inflation indices as at 2 above.
6.        Depreciation is based on the application of PLN's normal rates to
assets revalued annually as described at para. 9.

ANNEX 9
Page 2
Funds Flow
7.        Financing.  Borrowing has been assumed for 50% of the foreign
exchange component of capital expenditures, except where loan agreements with
international agencies require a higher proportion of foreign exchange costs
to be financed as debt.  Assumed terms on future borrowings are 9% for 19
years, including 4 years grace. Remaining foreign exchange and all local
capital expenditures (after deducting internal cash generation) are assumed
financed by equity contribution.
8.        Capital Expenditures exclude geothermal generating plants, which
are assumed to be constructed and operated by another agency.
Balance Sheet
9.        Fixed Assets are revalued annually according to the following
assumed indices:
FY 82 ........   1.09
FY 83-5 ........ 1.08
Thereafter ...... 1.07
