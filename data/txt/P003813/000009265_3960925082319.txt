ELEVENTO POWER PROJECT (LOAN 2056-ID)`
HIGHLIGHTS
The main objectives of the project were to increase PLNIs transmis-
sion and distribution capacities, to enable grid extensions to rural areas,
and to provide consultancy services for schemes to enhance the use of coal,
develop an effective grid system and continue PLNs institutional growth.
These objectives were met, although with some delay, by constructing and'
commissioning transmission facilities, substations and distribution facilities
in .the Jabotabek area in West Java.and by carrying out th.e engineering of the
Paiton coal-fired thermal power plant in West Java XI and the.500 kV
transmission system linking Central and East Java,2t and the managoment
,consultancy for further improveiisnts in PLI's financial planning. aid control
systems.
The implementation of the project took about three years longer than
envl*aged in the SAR.  The main factors that affected implementation were the
later than planned start of procurement of equipment and materials, the long
procurement cycle from the invitation of tenders to the signing of contracts,
including Government approval, the protracted perio4 for the establishment of
letters of creaits to contractors,Adelays in delivery of equipmei  and;
mate~ials, use of inexperienced an; financially unsound local contract6r for.
construction and etections of the distribution works, problems of right-of-way
and acquisition of land, and Ehe 4ddition in 1983, with Bank agreement, of-new
150 kV Jabotabek transmission works. The distribution and transmission coipao-
nents are operating satisfactorily. The training of and transfer of techno-
logy in traismission (150 kV) to PLN staff, by engineering consultants, was
acsomplished.
Apart from the delayed completion of the prpject and despite the
difficulties encountered with local contractors, the project has been t
completed in a satisfactory manner.  Through this and subsequent projects, the
Bank "as pursued with the Government of Indonesia, measures necessary to
incre*se the overall efficiency of.PLN, and to improve its projet implementa-
tion capacity.
The project cost in current prices, excluding financial charges
durivr construction, was about US$256.6 million (US$265.3 in constant 1982
pricus) as compared with the appraisa; estimate of US$319.4 million, or about
172 less.  This is attributed mainly t'b the devaluation of the local currency
and lower than forecasted price escalation rates,

v~~~~
The ex-post economic rate of return has been estimated to,be 12Z for
the Jabotabek distribution and transai"sion versus 18Z in the SAR.  The
revallated rate is lower mainly because of lower tariff levels prevailing in
Indonesia, compared to the SAR projections. Since 'the calculations exclude
the consumer surplus as in the SAR, the actual economic benefit fo the power
would be greater than that reflected by the IERR of 12 percent.  With proper
development of the distribution and transmission systems, the quality of
service-to the consumers has improved and better utilization of generation
capacity was obtained.  This project was important in contributing to the
development of the Jabotabek area.
The jproject is likely to maintain an acceptable level of benefits.
The project components have been maintained in good operating condition by PLN
since its commissioning.   PLN is expected to continue to apply appropriate
operation and mainte#ance procedures.' No adverse environmental impact took
place and the project did not involve resettlement.

ELEVENTH POWR PROJECT (LOAN 2056-IND)
I. BCKGROUND
The Bank's Earlier Oyerations
1.1      Since 1969, the Bank group has provided about US$3.0 billion for
power generation, transmission and distribution facilities through 17 separate
,projects.  Six transmission and distribution projects (Gredits 165-DND and
334-IND,, and Loans 1259-1ND, 2056-0IND, 2443-ID "ud 2778-U1D) rehabilitated
and e 4anded the distributii-n tacilities in Java.  Ten power projectb (Credit
399IND and Loans 1127-IND, - 136,-IND, 1513-DND, 1708-IND, 1872-.ND, 1950-IND,
2214-lED, 2300-I3D and 2443-IND)\'absisted PLN to expand electricity generation
capacity in Java, to provide a strong all-Java S00 kV grid, to extend distri-
butUon facilities, to re;uce system transmission and distribution losses, and
to introduce a pilot program of mini-hydro developma*t in Sumatra. In addi-
tion, three recently approved projects (Loans 3097-IND, 3098-IND and the R  ral
alectirfication Project) expect to continue to asiist in the expansion of tie
systeii tapability and institutional capacity.  Project Performance Audit
Reports and Project Completion Reports on the first ten projects (Credits
165-IND, 334-IND, 339-IND and Loans 11;7-IND, 1259-IND, 1365-IND and 1513-IND,
1708-IND. 1872-tED, 1950-IND and 1950-1-IND) have bwen issued. They conclude
that these projects achieved the objectives set out at the tin. of the
appraisal and were implemented within the budget. The relate4-iank loans to
the Eleventh Power Project are give In iAnnex 1. Taken together, these
proJects have enhanced PLNs institutional capabilities.
Sector Organization aud Objectives
1.2      The principal agency responsible for implementation of the GOI
policies in the energy sector is the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MEE). This
Ministry coordinates all activitiei in the energy sector and controls the
s-tate enterprises responsible for the execution of GOI policies in the energy
subsectors, which comprises PLN for electricity.  Other ministries and
agencies are also involved in the sector.  The electricity subsector isregu-
lated by MME through the Directotate, General of Electric tower and New Energy
(DGEP).
1.3      The general sector objectives, at the time the Eleventh-Power Project
was foimlated, may be summarized as followsi
(a) 'diversification of primary energy iorzrcs, with particular-
-   emphasis on renewable resources;
(b)  improving the efficiency of energy conversion and
'~ utilization; and                                                    -
Ic)  strengthening institutional c4pabilities in the sector.

1.2t                            -2 
1.4      Within these objectives it is essential to diversify energy usagd\, in
particular through the development of the coal, hydropower and geothermal
potential.  This will require massive investments and continued development of
institutional capabilities.
1.5      The PLN development program for 1981-90 covered the requirements for
generation, transmission, disttibution and other facilities. It was
formulated on the basis of the following objectives.
(a)  optimize domestic resource utilization by substituting use of oil by
coal, hydro and-geothermal resources for power generation and by
reducing the use of fuel-inefficient installations;
(bk  realize economies of scale through large-sized instaUlations;
tc)  ac#ieve-operatiihal economy by coordinating the utilization of plants
through intercotnected operations; and
Cd)  achieve and maintain acceptable standards of reliability of supply.
1.6      Thpl-Prc  ect formed part of the transmission and distribution compo-
nents of tha1 development program and comprised investments to meet urgent
needs.
1.7      The above objectives as well as the major priorlties associated with
them have been ;nyppor'td by the Bank through its involvement with the e ectri-
city subsector '&Ad have enabwed PLN rapidly to exoand its supply facilitles
and, coupled with efforts to qvolve integrAted grids, particularly in Java, to
exploit advanced techziologies to reduce supply cbsts.
II.  THE PROJECT
Prolect Formulation and'Preparation
2.1      The project formulated by the Bank was substantially in accordance
with the Governmente's ahd PLN*s efforts to increase PLN's transmiss*on and
distribution capacities"and electric grid extensions in the rural areas in the
regencies of Jakartt, Sogor, Tangerang and Bekasi (Jabotabek) in West Java.
The project was a patt of PLN's expansion plan.' The Bank financed the u
preparation of the project by funds provided-in previous loans.

Project Description
2.3      The project comprisedt.
(a) a distribution system for Jakarta akd the regencies of Bogor,
Tangerang and Beka6l. (Jabotabek) in West Java, involving about 450 km
of 20 kV  cables, 760 km of 20 kV overhead lines, 1,336 subatations
and 86d  pole-mounted transformers, about 5,300 km of new low voltage    «
lines and some 320,060 service conaections (See Annex 2),
(b)  a 150 kY voltage tsystem, complementary to (a) above, involving f4;¢e
new sy'-stations in Jakarta, 46 km of underground double-circuit 150
kV cables and 980 MVA of transformers (See Annex 2);-
(c)  engineering of the next ba4e-ldit coal or multiple-fired thermal
power units in Jsva;
(d)  engineerinLj of the Extra Nigh Voltage (EH) Central-East 4ava trans-
mission line; and
'e) \management consultancy for further improvements in PLN's-  inancial
planning and control systems.
-Proiect Desian and Organization                   - 
2.4      The distribution componept of the Project extended electricity supply
to both urban and&rural areas of-jabotabek and represented-a continuation of
the Bank's development efforts in-  important area.of PLN's operations,
accunting for about 30 percXxt of its electricity salesY  In 1979, SOPRELEC\'
of grance, the consulting-firm associated sinoae 1970 with the rehabilitatlon
-and epansion program of the distribution, system for Jakarta and Jabotabak.   ,
prepared the feasIbility study of the requirements of the-region during the
peilod 1982-1990.  The distribution expansion component was based on the
SOPRELEC report completed early in 1980. The detailed engineering of the
distribution, ccveriig preparat4on of bid aocuinents, evaluation of bids and
supe vision of construction was carried out by PLN., At the tine of project
appraisal, the LotI (of t*o) bid documents for equipment and materials for
this ptt of the project had been prpared by PLN and reviewed by the Bank..
\ \
2.5      The 150 kV transmission component was based dn detailed system
studies carried out by PIN and covered in its March 1981 'Report on
Reinforcement of the Jabotabek RV system during 1982-85'.  PLUNcontracted the
services of Preece Cardew & 4ider (PCR) consultants +f the UK; in association
wit PT Yodya Rarya for engi_eering design, preparation of tender documents,

East  -wCs carried out in        rey 1980. A Bank mission visited .Indoneoia in
Marc  1981 to appraise the Xleventh Power Project.' Loan negotiations took
place in Washington, I~.C, in September 1981. The\loan was approved by-the
Executive Directors on rNovember 10, 1981.', The loan anm project agreements
vere signed on tovember 16, 1981, aid the 'loan became eftict$ve In Ap2il 15,
1982.
(a)  Procurement. and Conotruction and Erection,of the Works
(i) Jabcitabek Disiribution~
The procurement for distributinn equipment and materials, which
was done by international competitive bidding (ICB), was divided
*  into two lots ae-planned.  Each lot\ended up with 25 contracts.
Thirty-seven contracts were awarded to foreign manufacturers and
suppliers and 13 to Indonesian compganies. tn addition, concrete
poles\contracts were awarded to Indonesian manufacturers and
suppll"'re selected by local competitive bidding CLCB.
Procurement of equipment and mat\erials.took longer than planned.
As shown in the\ milestone schedu'le for Jabotabek distribution,
(Annex 43.0 the migning of contracts was delayed byP three
five GIonths  for tpe first and lash t contracts ofmLot 1. However,
for Lot II the slutodstroae  to such *n extenti that the
f!a;st and last contracts that'were planned to lie signed in
August 1983 were actually signed in June 1984- and.February 1986

PLN divided into many contracts,the constru4tion and erection~ of
the distribution works In adhereoic4 to Govertment ot Indonesia"e
policy designed to promote the'development of local contracting.
capabilities. Consequently, these contracts contained-low
volume-of physical Vorlq: and value, to-attr'act small local
contractors. M4ost of those:~contractors we-re- inexperierveed. and
financially w4eak. They causbd delay in work eixecution. A'few

-for switchgear vere signed between December a982 and January
1983? with about six months delay.  Csblespnid
transformers were signed in December 1982 '-and February 19R3 with
five and seven months deL4ys as shown in mflestoge s0~eduls for
Jabotabek Transmission, (Annex 4). 'A totalof eleven- contrats

())
-It, ln spite of the assusrfice given by the Government of Indonesia
to the Bat*, rights ot way problems also arose during execution.
PLN had purchased alU  sites for the substations in 1,81/1982.
In September 1981, DKI Jakarta gave PLY the right of way for the
cable gputes-.  Although the cable routes had been agreed with
DKI Jakarta, PLN reports that one of the most serious causes of
delays was thv procedures for obtaining permits from DKI to lay,
the undergrbund;i5O kV cables.  PLN also needed a longer time
than pltiied to reach c,ompensation agreements with private land
owners along the route of the lines.  The effect of all the
T ctors mentioned'above,was to lengthen the time required for
preparing, executing ,pd,completing the project by PLN.
De ~ys in deliveries of equipmentland materials also occurred.
Fabtory reprogramming of the manufacture of the 150 kV oil-,,
filled cable as well as damage \tocables that occurred during
shipp)na and instvillatioui al8o coitributed,to further delays.
Each substation construction\was subdivided into separate
c4ntracts, and these were in turu broken down into contracts for
£ccess, dad, piling, main superstructure, air conditionAng,-
external ser*ice.,and landscaping.  The use of inexperi6aced
-qlal contractors placed the substation civil worki behind an
axte¢4y iate schedule., Some contractors defaulted and new ones
had to be hiied, essentially the same initial tendering
procedureKs.
The SAR schedule showed the transmission component to be in
commercial operation over a period from December 1983 to
February 1985 for the first and last site, esch site consisting
'of transmission link and gas insulated switchgear substation,
respectively.  All five sites included in the original scope
were.completed and energized progressively from January 1985 to
February 1987. resulting in an overall delay of two years. The
Pulogadung-Tosanprima double circuit link and gas insulated
witchgear substations which were a4ditional to the dFiginal
scope, have been completed and tested, but the connection
between existing transformers and gas insulated switchgear as
well as to customers remains to be made, outside the scope of
the project.
(iii). Operation and Maintenance of Jabotabek Projects
.o significant techni4al problems were encountered on any of the
electrical plants d4trng.installation and site tests.  PLN\Ihas
issued final acceptance certificates for all contracts in accor-
dance with contract stipulations.  All works are in.good
operating conditions.                -

(b)  Engineering and Design for Paston Thermal Power Plant *nd EHV
Transmission
(i)  Engineering of the Paiton Thermal Power Plant
'The contract between PLN and con *iltants was done under Loan
2056-IND. A part of the financing of the engineering work was
assigned to a previous Loan 1872-IND. \The construction of this
power plaEt is being financed by Loan iO98-I1ND approved in June
1989.
(ii)  Eugineering of the ;00 kV Central-East Java Transmission
This component was withdrawn from the funding from this loan and
was financed and completed through technical assistance from the
Federal Republic of Germany, which also financed the,
construction of the traismission lines and substations.
(c) Waizagent Consultnc!M
D.L. Pamintori, from Indonesia, in association vith Coopers &
Lybra,d of Australia, carried out thke management consultancy fort
the st4dy, design and implementatiop of an integrated
accountig, bu4geting and management informatAon system. This
work 1aa compluted in August 1985. The recomWendations-of the
study and their implementation are discussed in para. 6.8.
Implementation Risks
3.2      The SAR atated tiat there' wre no risks of any significance a " o-
ciated with the-,Project. However, the Bank was aware of the risks or issues
involved in the execution of'projects,izi Indonesia. and the consequent delays
in their implementation, such as protracted procurement procedur s and
problems in land and right of way acquis.tion. Consequently, the Bank held
discussion with the Government and PLN on both issues to address the
particular questions and procedures related to procurement. There were
expectations that the situlation would improve. On the matteF of land and
right-of-way, the'Bank req ired from th.e Government of Indonelia, as a
condition of the loan presentation to the Ezxecutive Directors, assursnce that
PLN woild be given approval for the acquisition of land for, substations and
right-of-way for cable routes.  Thts condition was met and, therefore, no
problems were anticipated on this tatter.  Subsequently, however, the approval
procedures of Jakarta municipal corporation (DXI) proved to be very cumbersome
and resulted in delays in the ppoject implementation.
3.3      The SM  was prepared on thi basis of and expactation that experienced
contractors would supply equipment and materials and construct s~nd erect'the
works.  This was achieved to a high degree in the procurement of equipment and
materials, although there were delays in the delivery of goods,'ibut not in the
construction'and erection of worAs because of the'high numbqr of inexperienced
local contractors hired for\that purpose, in acqordance witfi GO! procedures.
The social cons,equences of tWA. Govwrnment poliy may have been'beneficial but
the costs in terms of project delays were high.



&-
Environmental Impact of the Proilct
3.4      No environmental problems arose in connection with the project.  In
congested areas the 150 kV and the medium-voltage lines were located
underground. The 150 kV substations are tf the compact gas-insulated
switch$ear type, which is appropriate for urban locations. In less congested
areas both the medium-voltage and low-voltage systems are overground. No
res"ttlemest was required as a result of the project.
Bank Proiect Supervision
3'.5     The Bank carried out about eight supervision missions to Indonesia
fox Bank-financed power projects from 1984 to 1988. No supervision missions
deem to have taken place in 1982 and 1983. Each mission discussed the imple-
mentat,ion problems associated with the Vroject. However, the Bank seems not
to have pa14d appropriate attention to the Jabotabek distribution and tranonis-
sion compoient of the Project, especially in the earlier part of the project
implementation. A total of 23.6 staff weeks was expended for the supervision
of this project between 1982 and 1989.
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3 .6     PLN carried out the engineering and design, preparation of tenoer
documents, including teohnical specifications, bidding, preparation of
construction drawings, and supervision of construction of the distribution \
component of the project. The 150 kV Jabotabek transmission project includes
such components as oil filled transmission cables and gas insulated switchgear
which are relatively new in Tndonesia.  Therefore, PLN contracted consulting
firms t\o render the above mentioned tasks for the transmission. These consul-
tants a4so trained PLN staff and transferted technology in the required
technicsi areas.  PLN reports that the consultants rendered satisfactory
eervice.  The financial consultants completed their work $in August 1985.
__ ProjectDocumentaticn and Dati
3.7  \ ' The legal agreement between the Governmeni of Indonesi, PLN and the
Bank provided a framework for project execution such as Schedul,  I and bidding
procedures.
3.8      PLN's 9ystems of account did not provide a good base for,project
accounts in such areas as engineering and design, supervision and administra-
tion by PLN staff. Therefore, the final costs of these items for the project
wore estimated in agreement with PLN by using their percent relationship to
the construction as derived from the SAR  (Annex 4).  Otherwsse, most basic
data wete available to prepare the_roje;t completion report-
Borrower Performance
3.9      PLN hired consultants to prepare the distribution and transmission
feasibility studies an4 development plans that wezje used in the preparation
and appraisal of the ptoject by the Bank.  The Government if Indonesia as well
as PLN provided the support needed in the appraisal phase, At project
appraisal, PLI hadt already completed Lot I, tender documents for distribution
equipment and ,aterials.  This enibled PLN to call\for bids within a
reasonable time after loan approval. The bid documents for transmission were

-9-
completed at the beginning of 1982, close to schedule. This advanced prepara-
tion and early procurement action helped to speed up 'implementation.  As in
previous Bank financed Trojects, PLN fsced the same problems in project
implementation, in partydue to the regulations and.directives established by
the Government of Indonesia for public sector institutions like PLN. To
alleviate this situation, the Bank has already suggested that GOI grant more
a  toAmy to PLN.  Some progress in this regard has been made (para 6.9)
Proiect Costs and Financing
3.10     The project cost, in current prices, excluding finqncial chargei
during construction, was about US$256.6 million (Annex 5. Project Costs and
Financing) and USS265.3 in constant 1982 prices, as compared with an appraisal
estimate of US$319.4 million, or about 17 percent less. During the period of
project execution the Rupiah was devalued from Rp 625=US$1.00 in 1982 to Rp
1740=US$l.O0 at the end of 1988. This contributed to. lower local cost in USS
terms.  The lower foreign cost was largely due to lower price escalation rates
than those tsed to estimate price contingency in the SAR.
3.11     The sourqes of financing include Loan 2056-IND totalling US$167.02
m$llion, and GOI/PLN participation of US$89.6 eillion equivalent as given in
AnnexS.
k               i                                                      'C
Loan Allocationi
3.12     The allocstior  of loan proceeds as originally planned was tctually
followed and the comparison between the anticipated and final figures are
shown in Annex 6, Disbursement and Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the Loan.
Disbursements
3.13     Disbursements were'behind, the SAR estimates throughout the execution
period as shown in Annex 7, Loan 2056-IND Disbursements. This was th* result
of a slow beginning on procurement contracts for equipment `and material} and
construction and erection of works and the slower rate of implementation than
that had been assumed in the SAR. Because of this the loan closing took place
on June 30, 1988.
IV. PROJECT RESULTS
4.1 (a)  Project Obie±tives
The main objectives and the physicai' trgets of the project have been
uibstantially ach 4eved as shown in Annex 2.  Th; 150 kV Jibotabek
transmission project was augmented bT a short transmission line and a
gas-insulated switchgear substation to increase supply to industrial
consimers .                     .       |,
Even with the belated commissioning of the project, total energy
sales in tbe Jabotabek area have grown at'an average annual rate of
12 percent and the number of total consumers increased froml.0
million to 1.3 million from 1986 to 1989.  The increased sales in kWh
have contributed to improve PLN sales revenues. The training and



.,    \                 ,    - ~~~~~~~10-V 
transfer of technology in medium voltage (150 kV) transmission should
improve PLN's performance in the engineering and design of this type
of project.
(b) Physical Results
The physical targets of the Jabotabek distributioz and transmission
compon=nts were substantially achieved in most cas'es. The engineer-
in8 and design of the Paiton thermal power plant and the 500 kV
transmission system between Central qnd East Java (Annex 2) were
carried out.
(c) Economic Rate of Return
The internal economic rate of return of the Jabotabek distribution
and transmission components of the project calculated in the SAR was
about 18 percent.  It was calculated on the cost of the components
expressed in constant prices of 1981 after allowing for foreign
exchange and local currency shadow prices, and ion the cost of
operation and maintenancp and generation related to the Jabotabek
project.  The Jabot#bek 4rea incremental sales revenues were used as
a proxy for benefits and consumer surpluses were not included. The
*ex-po#t economic rate of return has been estimated to be 12 percent
for the project as-built, using the sime methodology as was used-ii
the SAR (Annex 8). The main reason why the ex-post estimate of the
-rate of return is lower, even though the cost of She project
decreased, is basically because the average revenue per kWh did not
increase as assumed for the economic analysis in the SAR. Therefore,
the nqt benefits in terms of 1981 prices are nearly 85 percent lower
than those used in the SAR, although tho incremental'sales are about
7 percent higher than those estimated fUr the first year of operation
of whole project.  It should be mentioned that the cost of the
project n'ed to calculate the rate of return 9s expressed t constant
prices oi 1981 as in the SAR. Therefore,lthe\.cost stream for the
economic analysis excludes financial charges during construction as
it is customary.  The lowrer-rate of return is an indication of the
lower than expected level of tariff which alio reflected on the
financial performance of PLN in the project *plementation period.
However, since the calculated lERR of 12 pereent excludes consumer
surplus, the actual economic benefits of the project would be much
greater than the IERR figure of 12 percent reflects. With the proper
development of the distribution and transmission systems, the quality
of service to the consumers should improve and better utilizat1on of
generation capacity will be obtained. This project contributed to the
development' of the Jabotabek area.
Project Sust4lnability        -
4.2      The Jabotabek distribution and transmission projects will most likely
maintain an acceptable level of benefits throughout its econ{mic-life.  PLN
sales in the Jabotabek area Opreseht about 30 percent of its total sales with
an average annual growth of 12 percent in the five years up to PLN's fiscal
year 1988/89.\ PLN is expected to use adequate operation and maintenance
procedures of project facilities to enstire their reliable operation.

V. FIVIAI  PERFOMNIE
Financial Objectives
5.1      Under the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1513-IND), a self-financing
ratio (SFR) covenant was adopted for the first time, with the objective of
fiiancing, out of internal cash gene'Iation, a reasonable pfoportion of PLNI's
investment program. The agreed SFR was  0 percent by 198S86, with Interim
targets for the intervening years.  The ;irst such interim target was 17
percent for the period 1976177 to 1977/79. This figure was achieved during
the three-year period ending 1977178.
5.2      The quantification of SFR interim targets had been revised in 1979
under the Eighth Power Project (Loan 1708-IND), somewhat modified in 1960
under the Ninth Power Project (Loan 187a-IND), and subsequently revised in
1982 under the Twelfth Power Project (Loan 2214-IND),.to take into account
significant\changes in PLN's capital expenditures and fuel costs,. The SPR
target for 1985/86 and onwards was reduced at the same time to adjust the
minimum Indicative targets inversely with any significant changes in PLN's
capital expev 4tures and fuel costs.

5.5  K   Actual e6ergy revenues increased over the period 1&81182 through
1986187, at 32 percent p.a., compared to the projected 35 percent p.a.--As
regards PLN sales,in GWh, the actual results were close to the projected sales
until 1982/83.  However,during the period 1983184 through 1986/87 actual
mnlual average sales growth was only about 13 percent, compared to 19.5
percent projected for the same period. -In 1983184 and 1984/85 actu41 annasl
a4es growth was only 10 percent, mainly due tot   (a) delays in some
consumers connection program due to budgetary constraints, and (b) the
economic slowdown leading to lower consumption from existing customers.
However, during l9@5/86 and 1986/87 actual sales increased at an average
.,annual rate of,about 16 percent, with industrial consumers contributing to a
Alarge part 'of t)ae increase.  The SAR provided fitancial projections for fiscal
years 1981182 to 1986187.  A comparison of the projected and actual financial
results is summarized in Annex 9, Table 1.  Detailed comparative financial
statements are given in Annex 9, Tables 2 to 4.
Tariffs
5.6      Fuel price increases following GOI's policy of removing domestic oil.
-subsidies significantly increased PLN's operating expenses.  The average fuel
price paid by PLN, which was about Rp 50 liter in 1980/81, *nWreased by 20
percent in 1982/83 and about 60 percent p.a. in 1983/84 and 1984/85. The fuel
cost as a percentage of total operating expenses rose from 35 percent in
1982183 to 54.3 percent in 1986/87.
5.7      While fuel prices increased significantly, tariff adjustments during
1980181 to 1982/83 merely offset the fuel cost increases and in addition
lagged behind the fuel price adjustments.  Consequently, PLN's tariffs were
not sufficient to cover the'full increases in its operating expenses, result-
* ng in operating losses in fiscal years 1981/82 thr4ugh 1985186.
5.8.    In May 1980, PLY introduced basic rate schedules to structure its
electricity tariff according.ta Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) principles, as
agreed with the Bank under the 'Seventh Power project (Loan 1513-IND). Bow-
ever, from 1980 to 1983, all tariff increases were effected entirely through
changes in the energy charges. The failure to adjust the demand charges thus
reintroduced distortions in the tariff structure which had been largely recti-
fied in the tariff revision of May 1980. -
5.9      In 1983, and again in 1987,' the Bank assisted PLN in its studies of
costs and tariff structure. Based on the results of these,studies, PLN rovised
its tariff structure to reflect better the LRUC of electricity supply. The
Bank's continued involvement in the powwr'ifttor and ita sWpport in tariff
stddles has been an importaix contributing factor in,motivating PLN towards
economic efficiency pricing.  In March 1984, PLN introduced at increase of
about 24 percent in the demand as well as energy charges. The next tariff:
adjustment became effective April 1,-1989,'when the demand charge was raised
by '50 percent for all citegories of consumers, and energy charges were raiseQ
significantly for both peak and,off-peak use, resulting in an average increaie
of aboutC25 percent in the electricity rates.
Financial Management

been incurring los3es indicated that  heYSfl type of measure with the covenan-
ted levels was less thala appropriate,from,the view point of financial
viability.  Under the PFurteenth Power PrOject (Loan Z443-IND, 1984), GOI/PLN
agreed to a rate of return (ROR) covenant of at least 8 perdent fro4 1986187
onwards, with a minimum target of 6 percent in 1985/86. The SFR was retained
as one of'the performance 'indicators to be monitored regularly to ensure PLN's
pelf-financing capability. While PLN was able to meet-the indicative SFR
arget for 1984/85, It fell short of both the SFR aid ROR targets for 1985/86.
In 198f, ilt became increasingly apparent that PLN will be dnable to satisfy
the requirements of the ,ROR covenant adopted under Loan 2443-IND. The
Government, PLN and the Bank then concluded that an ROR covenant for PLN's
operatipns as a whole was inappropriatekin view of the largely socially-
oriented' and fragmented nature of PLN's operations outside Java, and the
revenue covenant was modified. Under the modifl.ed-revenue covenant, PLN was
required to achieve:, (a) for its operations in Java, a ROR of not \ess than 8
percent no later than' 1988189 and to maintain it at or above that level for,
fiscal years thereafter, and (b) for its operations outside Java, a break-even
situation no later than 1990-91. A covenant,under Loan 2778-IND also required
PLN to carry out an action plan for eff4ciency improvements fot all its
operations, in a manner to ensure tht the requirements of the revenue
covenant for its operations ou-tside Java are adhieved.
5.11    'Due to several factors,,\including (a) the devaluation of the
Indonesiap currency in September 1986; (b) inflation; and (c) substantial
increaseosin the proportion of oil-based generation in 198?188 compared to
1986187, mainly due to the drought of 1987, PLNs- financial performance showed
a substantial deterioratiqn in 1987188 compared to 1986187.  This trend con-
tiniod in 1988189.  Howevek, the Government approved kn average tariff
increase of about 25 percent in the electricity rates effectire April l, 1989,
which has restored PLN's profitability. In view of the abov4ei under the-Power
Sector Efficiency -and Paiton Thermal Power projects (Loans 3097-^IN and
3098-nID, 1989), the test years for the financial performance targets An the
revenue covenant were revised, with PLI's operations in Java expected to
achieve annual ROR of not less than 8 percent in 1989190 and fiscal years
thereafter, and tht operations outside Java to achieve a break-even situation
'beginning with 1992193.  PLN's actual financial performance for 1987/88 -         _
1988189 and the estimate for 1989190, -and related incode-4atements for its
Java and non-Java operations 'are provided in Annex,10, Tables 1 to 5.
'5.12    Under the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1259-1ND), two covenants were'
intiroduced to ensure PLN's prudent debt managements (a) ajinimum future debt
service coverage of 1.0;'and (b) setilement of all its debts within one-motth_
wben due.  Tbpse covenants (which also applied for the Sixth Power Project,
Loan 1365-lID) were replaced under-the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1513-IND)
bys ,(i) minimum future debt service coverage of 1.3 times; and (ii) a debt/
equity ratio of 60140;  These -c*enants were,continued under the Eighth,
Ninth, Tenth and.V1sventh Power'Proje'cts (Loans 1708-IND, 1872-IND, 1950-_ND
and 2056-IND).  The Thirteenth Power Project (Loan 2300-INW, 1983) adopted
only one debt management covenant which required a minimum of 1,5 ti*ms
coverage of future debt service each year out of the forecast internal funds
for that year; this requirement replaced all earlier debt limitation cove-
nants. This change reflected the gr6wth of P1nM, and at the same time, made
allowance for' the added,future earning power.  PLN has been complying-with
this covea _ except in 1987/88 when the A-bt coverage had declined td 1.1
times.



; 14-
5.13     PLNVs collection performance has been generally satisfactory.  The
accounts receivable position of customers other than government users has been
improved to under t;sv months of bi'lling.  PLN's sales to government users
account-,for about' 10 percent of its total sales; but collections from some
government users have not been promptly settled when due.
5.14     The Govetnment has taken various measures to imprive the payment
performance by government users.  Outstanding government accounts receivable
werbzreduced from over one year in 1981/82 to about five months of billing in
1983/84. An action plan was agreed under the Fourte&nth Power project (Loan
2443-IND) to reduce the arTears further.  It was also agreed under the    -
Foutteenth Power Project 't modify the earlier covenant, which required each
government user to pay its bilU promptly, to a covenant that required the
amounts owed by all government users in aggregat to be kept to lees than-two
months of total billings for such users. PLU is also required under the new
covezvant to keep collection data for government users adequately disaggregated
so that the source of any overdue paymnet problemp could be identified.  As a
result of continued efforts by concerned ministriis and PLN, the overdue
government accounts receivable were redcuced considerably during 1984/85
198586.  They were equivalent to less than two months of annual killings at
the end of FY 1986 87, and currently remain so.
&uditLn 
5.15     PLN's accounts are required by its charter to be audited by
Oovernmeut auditors.  The audit ieports are apceptable to the Bank, but have
been subject to long delays. Since 1983, PLN has made special efforts to
expedite the closing of accounts and has succeeded in completing them usually
within six months after the close of the fiscal year as stipuXated by
Goverment for all public c4rporations.  This is a significant improvement.
Government audit Iormally takes two to three months.  To be more realistic and    K
aloo in line with PLN' a charter requirement nd Government's regulations, the
lankIs audit submissi n covenant was amended nder the Fourteenth Power
Project (Loan 2443-IND) to require PLN to submit tv the Bank its unaudited
accounts no later than six months, and'\the audited financial. statements ind
the report of: mAch audit zi. later than nine month&-a*te*-the clone of the
fiscal year. While the unaudited accounts have generally been received by the
Bank In time, there are still some delays in receiving the audited accounts
-=-and report.               -
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.1      it the beginnig o4  the 1980s, PLN had begun to emerge and was
continuing to develop bito a well-organized power utility.  Th  project under
review contributed to its further institutional development through cpntinuous
review of financial performance and organizationai developmenta .-PLN' 1
ihstitutional development and the Bank's-involvement in this process is
briefly narrated below.                                          --
Nana nt f ~-                                 K.
6.2     PLN's management systeme have in general been well designed; however-
there are still certain weaknesses, niotably in the division of responsibility

and accountability bet4yeen the regions on the on6 hand and the central ftpart-"
ments on the other. -The process of decentralization of responsibility to the
regions was,initiated by PLN in Decemberi 1987, as part \pf a reorganizatiof%
vithin its centrxl.departments and regional offices to' streamline planning,>
programming,- budget$ng, and operat-iona-l wad eva,4ation activities.  The,
regional managers ha've been assigned a larger rolo in the preparation of 'their
annual programs ond budget' and greater responsibllity and accountability for
carrying out their operational functions. These organizational chanAev are a
step in the right direction and are expected to help improve'the overall
effi4lency and effectiveness of P1.N. In viewi of the expected substantial'
growth in',PLN's9 operations, the need for a review of P1.3's institutional a
development was recognized. Toward this end, a review of the adVquacy of the
institutional framework in the power sector, including the 'role of P1.N aind its -v
relationship with the dovernment, was undertaken by the Bank in Pebru"ry/March
1989. The results of this roview were prrsented to the Government in December
1989 and provide a basis for future dialogue with the Governmentron the reform
of the regulatory framework-for the powef   sector in  ndonfesia.
6.3      A managementauditwas coimmissioned byy PPL   in D98Oieml and was untior-
taken by a local firiA working in 'association with internationial manatgement'
coisultants. Their recopsrnendations for establishment of a more comprehlnnive
corporate plannig process, improvement in coordination between the various
headquarters departments and between headquarters aldn the regions, adoption of
caommn  design standards and prtcurement methodology and improvements in
accounting, computing, inventory control and personnelimanagement were         a
reviewed by an In-house committee and several recomhenldations were implemen-
ted.  The  ank hae  financed four mPNagement studiesv  Project Manageimet
Advisoiy Services (under Loan 1708-tNo), Accounting, Butgeting and Management
Information System (und-r Loan 2056-IND), 'Management Information Systems for
P1LY (under Loan 2S00-I), and Improvement of Genteral Accounting (Loan
309789ID).  Sustained oftor4s  at implementatsta are expected to strengthen and.-
streamline PLova management cspabilitles.    wn
Planning, Desiga  and Research
6.4 3    PL. has acquired adequate expertise in generati*n  trandmissin aAnd
distribution planning. Steps towards greater regional involvement in plranning
were taken in 1981, and a series ofvementagemerdevelopment courses have been
instituted for regional and branct  mana es.  Several Bank-financed studies
have been devised for enhatcing Pcnts planning capabilities notably the Power
Market Study (under Loan 1950-lND) and thee ryro riotential Studies (under Loan
1365-T).h Towards strng'thening Pfaes engineering and design captbilitiesnt
in 1985, P1.N established an Engineering Services Cudter as agreed under Loan
2443-nfm.  To support the development of this center, a I rovision for consul-
taVNcy assistance was incl  and in Loan 2778- .  Witho aGll these eff(Lrta   P1*'s,
dependence on engineering consultants is expected to continue'to fastletenr the
1Trears.   Pc
6.5      With generation  nnd transmissionoplanning functions now wel  estab
lished in PlN and functieping smoothly, gthe emphasi  now rests on improving
the planning, operation, maintenance and'management \ofpdistribution fhacili-
ties, for which responsibility is largely dispersed in Pvl.s regional offices.
Technical assistance for the strengthenins g p f Pann n   distributiono mana ement
functionsiu  provided under the Power Sectohe \fficiencty ProSject (Louan
s36S-IND). AowAs, tostrengthen the corporate pianning function, Pcap has set
up, as irt of the 1988 reorganizationo planning units in then fnctionle-



dit~etoT~tes and the regional offtces, with the corporate planning division iu
the plarn4ag 'directorate hiaving the responsibility for the overall
.coordinat*on othplanning activities.* Thchnical ashistac'       poie   ne
the Ftwer 'Sactor Efficiency project (Loan 3097-IND) will help -4evelop further
rLN's corporate planning as well .as financial planning functions.
M?po,r and Training
6.6      PLN expends considerable effort in the training of staff not only
withiln the organixation,i'but also through student scholarship and foretgn
training. These efforts have been largely successful. In 1908189, abo'ut
7,000 staff received training of various durations, including about 200 staff
trained overseas. The Bank has been supporting P~.Nls training activities and
() human resources development offorts, including the establi esment of several
training c enters. The lightih and NiatI4,Power Projecta (Loans 1708-IND and
1872-InM) provide4 for training in operation of large thermal generating units
and supply of a siulator for such traininsg at the Suralaya Theral Power
Plant. The Tenth Power,Project (Loan ~950-IN) provided for on-the-job
training in the country, in selected fields such as civil works contract
administration. The Twelfth Power Project (Loan 2214-IN w) ilhlpudes a large
training conponent of US$20.0 millibp to (i) reorganize and enlarge the entire
manpower development, training and personnel management functions for middle
and lower kevel staff, lzroving job performance evaluatioln systems and intro-
duci'g in-house management training; (ii) settingrup new traoinin centers, for
theial power plants, tranasmission lines and middle-level mandgel; and (iii) a
program for the training of senior- and middle-level personoel out2side
Indonesia in toe  ical and financial areas. Progress undera\thee activities
bes been satisfactory.  In\addition, under the Paiton Themal Power and Power
Sector Efficienc Projects (Loan 3097-1N and 3098-oeD), s(pecific training is
provide4 in the areas of die el thermal plant operations, diettibution manage-
ment, corporate and fria  planning, general acc ounting and cae P
management.
Accounting an t  udtring    s         f      s
6.7     Pcopn accounting system, installed in the early 1970s, follows
geoerally accepted accounting principles , and normal utislity practices, boti
it needs upgrading to keep pace with the growing complexity and volume-of
accounting transactions, .~Ther'e is need fo"r improvement with respect to the
completeness and accuracy of fixed asset accounting, depreciwtion, inventory
accounting and accounts receivables. The accounting system neqsds to produce
more, accurate information .in a timely manmr for decision-making purposes.
Also, PLtNs internal procedures for preparing budgets and monitoring actual
expenditures need to be atrengthened through better coordination among and 
participaton by the vrrious functional directohratestand regional offices in
the proces*  to enan o e   bugen   value a aa S8ND)emen tool.' 
6.8      Under the presqnt project, funds were provided for management consul-m
tancy for developing an-integrated system for budgeting, accounting, and
financial,:reporting. The study prop;sed a now finanpial managen~ent informa-
ction systm based on a new general ledger, identified improvemen't s in PLNvs

eXnerallyre) pcep  saed modifications ic   ,udgeting control procedures, and
recouendid ccmputerizationos f the general' ledger. The recoumendations of the



-17-
study are being implemented by PLN through various activiti"s.  PLN has
engaged or is engaging consultants to,improve fixed assets accounting, cost
accounting, and inventory management.  A major constraint to PLN's accounting
has been a lack of trained senior accountants and iniformn accounting proce-
dures.  Since 1987, PLN is implementing an action plan to improve its account-
ing practices and functions by (i) establishing a uniform accounting system,
(Ui) improving related support systems, (iii) sensitizing concerned nonfinan-
cial managers and staff to the importance of timely and accurate accounting.
(iv) upgrading the skills of the accounting staff through in,house and
external training courses, and (v) computerizing the accounting prbcess.
through its recent reorganization, PLN is also gttempting to improve coordina-
tion between its departments and its regional offices in the areas of budget
preparation, and-monitoring and evaluation of performarce as discussied in
para. 6.2. The Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND) provides tech-
nical assistance to i  rove further.the accounting system.
i .
Procurement
6.9      Procurement of goods and services has a major influence on PLIN's
overall performance in project implementation.z Procedures.introduced by
Government in 1980 for external control' of pro8urem6nt of both consultants' 
services, andsof goods and services had reduced PLN's autonomy in procurement.
The gains in timely preparatory work on selection of-consultants ah# bidding
on power projects were all.but-lost, partly because of delays in approval of.
contract qwarzs by authori~ies outside PLN ado also because of delays in
openiig lekters of \redit.  In other case, PLN's internal evaluation system
c^uld also have been responsib e. The organization of procurement was
reviewed (inter alia) by consultants In the con.e*t of the project manaSement
study as a component of the Eighth tower project (Loan 1708$IND). After the
development of the Engineering Services Center (para. 6.4), the procure*ent
function for all major projects is now centralized 'in PL.  The Government
procedures for external control of ;rocurement were simplified in 1988,
resulting in expanded autonomy for PLN in the area of materials prqcurement
and contract administration. However. further stren4thening and >
simplification of these \procedures is desirable to avoid costly impIementation
K  delays.
Overall Performance
6.10     PLN's overall performance from the time of project apprais i1981-
till L988/89 has been impressive. Its sales increased annually by an average
of ab=ut 15 percent and performance indicatorl such as the number of consumers
per employee increased from 83 to 181 (i.e., by 118 percert).  Its \ambitious
Vcustomer-connection programs 'ere fulfilled year-after year.  Stendards of  N
reliability-of supply were improved.  The rate of grqwth of uneconbmic captive
plants in tIe country declined after 1977.  Improvemnuts in the speed of'
implementation of projects were.erode'd by slippages of over a year in
construction of major thermal projects like Muara Karang, Semarani ahd
Suralaya.  The main problems have now shifted to complex procurement\,
procedurzs and'resoxtrc constaints.  PLNls drive to reduce transmission and
distribution losses . which appetted to have run out-of momentum in 19821 U3.
fss revived, ;nd an intensive loss-reduct on effbrt has been initiated."<
Transmission and distribution losses, *hIch ;eawhed 20.8 percent An 1983184
were lowered to 19.6 percent in 1986187, and were 16.9 percent in 1988/89.

VIT. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1      The main-factors responsible for the delay in completing the
distribution and transmission projects weres (i) the later-than-planned start
of procurement of equipment and materials, (ii) in the long procurement cycle
from the invitation of bids to the signing of the contracts, including the
period required by Government approvals, (iii) in the protracted period for
the establishment of letters of credit, (iv) delays in delivery of equipment,
(v) a high number of contracts for construction and erection of the
distribution work, inexperidtced local contractors, lengthy right-of-way
acquisition procedures and the addition in 1983 of a new 150 kV substation.
which was completed in April 1989. Budgetary constraints, particularly in
1984/85,. Ind,l98SI86, also conttibuted to the implementjtion delays.
- 7}.2   Some of the problems mentioned were Wncountered in-earlier projects.
There is a need to reduce implementation delays by adopting speedier proce-
dures and decision-making and adequate organization and staffing and better
constructi,n planning. GOI and PLN are aware of these situations and are
addressing 'thl at the nati-nal and institutional levels. The Bank should
codtinue to support these acttons that once implemented, would minimize the
problems.-that continue to impact adversely on project\ implementstion. The
issue of increased autonomy for PLN is being discussed by the Bank with the
G9vernment of Indonesia                  .                 I
