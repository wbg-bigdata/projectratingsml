MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON THE PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA FOR
AN ANDHRA PRADESH FORESTRY PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on the proposed Development
Credit of SDR 55.6 million (US$77.4 million equivalent) to India is submitted
for approval. The IDA Credit would be on standard terms, with 35 years
maturity, to help finance the Andhra Pradesh Forestry Project.
2.    Country/Sector Background.  India's area covered by forests is about 64
million ha or 19% of the country's land area. Forest resources play an
important role in maintaining environmental stability and they are the
principal source of timber, household energl, fodder and other non-timber
forest products (NTFP). The contribution of the forestry sector to GNP has
been estimated at less than two percent, but this does not take into account
non-monetary and external benefits, unrecorded harvests of timber and
fuelwood, nor the importance of the forests to supporting the livestock
population; The productivity of India's forests is generally low and almost
half of the forest area is badly degraded. Forest degradation continues with
the pressure caused by the rising population and over-grazing. Government is
addressing the problems of the forestry sector through policy reform,
legislation and afforestation. The National Forest Policy, revised in 1988,
gives emphasis to the improvement of environmental stability, preservation of
ecological diversity, improvement of soil and water conservation, and an
increase in timber productivity and in the area under tree cover. The policy
focuses on the use of forests to meet the requirements of rural and tribal
populations for fuelwood, fodder and NTFP, whilst encouraging industries to
obtain wood raw materials mainly from. farm forestry. While focussing strongly
on social and environmental issues, the policy gives less attention to
economic considerations.
3.    The status of the forestry resources and forestry issues in Andhra
Pradesh are very similar to those of the country as a whole. The state has a
recorded forest area of 6.4 million ha or 23% of its geographical area. Almost
3 million ha of the forest area is degraded, one half of this being devoid of
tree cover. The main issue is rapid depletion of the forest resource in t1.4
face of overwhelming population and grazing pressure. The present incentives
and public institutions structure, technological support and regulating
policies are unable to resolve this problem. In terms of sustainable
production, the understocked forest resource is able to satisfy only a
fraction of the wood required in the state.
4.    India's forest administration was established more than a century ago to
protect the forest resource against people's encroachment to preserve it for
industrial use and nature conservation. However, this approach is no longer
working well and remaining forest areas and new forest plantations will need
to be protected and managed through cooperation with the local population to
stay intact. Although state forest departments have had considerable freedom
to renew themselves in order to adapt to changing needs, most have not done so
sufficiently, including the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department. As a result the



2
department cannot adequately respond to current needs of an impoverished and
growing rural population, the need for forests to meet environmental goals,
nor the increasing requirements of the industrial sector. The complementary
role in the forestry sector's development by private farmers has also not well
taken off, neither are the potential roles of commercial companies, NGOs and
local institutions sufficiently recognized by government. Felling and
transport regulations pose disincentives to private forestry which in some
locations competes with underpriced produce from public lands and often lacks
quality planting materials, technology packages, marketing support and credit.
Andhra Pradesh still has a rich and diverse flora and fauna in its forests,
but there is no well-defined con3ervation strategy. The Andhra Pradesh
government has recognized that major changes in the forestry sector are
needed; particularly its approach to forest management and protection needs to
be modified.
5.    Lesains Learned Prom Previoun Bank Operations.  Over the past 15 years
the Bank has supported ten projects in the field of forestry and resource
conservation in India with lending in the amount of about US$ 500 million
equivalent. It has assessed the experisnces gained through project
supervision, project completion reports and sector reviews (Bank-wide [1991],
Asia regional 11992], as well as India-specific [Report No. 10965-IN, 1993]).
Past forestry projects in India supported mainly social forestry and watershed
activities, which have had mixed success. The involvement of local people in
these projects was generally inadequate and they did not cover the designated
forest lands, i.e. the government's forest estate. Many of the projects
encountered implementation problems causing delay in disbursements and
completion due to slow project mobilization, institutional weaknesses and
insufficient local funding. The major lesson from the earlier generation of
projects was that the programs were inadequate in scope to address the complex
issues affecting fozests. Other important lessons include a need for:
increased forest productivity through improved plant propagation and extension
services; revitalization of production-supportive forestry research,
particularly applied research at the state level; more emphasis on the
planning, management and environmental dimensions of existing natural forests
and plantations, as well as monitoring; solutions to the problems of common
property rights through a better local participation process and well-defined
benefit sharing arrangements; inter-agency coordination in the execution of
the various project components of the more comprehensive projects; and
redefinition of the role of government and revision of the restrictive
regulatory policies to pave the way for private and public investments in the
forestry sector.
6.    Recently two statewide and sectorwide forestry projects were approved by
the Board, in which the above lessons have been taken into account and
investments are linked to reforms of the state's forestry institutions and
policies: The Maharashtra Forestry Project (Cr. 2328-IN, 1992) for an amount
of SDR 88.9 million and the West Bengal Forestry Project (CR. 2328-IN, 1992)
for SDR 24.4 million. While the Bank has no experience in forestry in Andhra
Pradesh, the proposed operation would build on the same concept while adapting
to the particular situation in Andhra Pradesh.

7.    Cougtry AssistanSe StrategY and Rationale for Bank InvolYvment.  The
Bank's overall assistance strategy to the rural sector in India is to support
policies and investments that promote economic growth and poverty alleviation
in a context of macroeconomic restructuring. The emphasis is on (a) efficient
resource allocation, (b) increased efficiency in the public sector and (c)
appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems to the rural poor. The
strategy promotes sustainable programs in agricultural production and
forestry, that will help to alleviate poverty in the most backward areas. The
Bank's current strategy to specifically support forestry in India is two-
pronged: (i) state-level forestry development in a comprehensive manner,
which would support the participation of relevant public and private 'actors'
in the forestry sector and integrate forestry more closely with agriculture
and livestock; and (ii) capacity strengthening of technical and educational
institutions of the center and in states to provide efficient forestry
research, education and training. The proposed project fits well within this
strategic framework and is in line with Bank overall policy for the forestry
sector. It would target the rural poor, i.e. predominantly fringe forest
dwellers and tribal peoples of Andhra Pradesh. The investment component would
emphasize an ongoing policy dialogue concerning key forestry issues. The
project would also promote participatory forest management as an approach to
forest management and conservation in Andhra Pradesh that is effective and
sustainable. The project design and the implementation process are also
consistent with the Bank's Operational Directive (OD 4.20) which deals with
indigenous people (tribals). The project would also parallel the state-by-
state approach followed in current Bank-supported agricultural and irrigation
development projects in India.
8.    Project Objectives.  The proposed project's main objectives are to
increase forest productivity and quality, protect the environment, and
alleviate rural poverty, as well as streamline/strengthen sector policies to
be consistent with these objectives, so that the process of continuing
degradation of the state's forests will be reversed. This would be achieved
by: (i) introducing local people participation in management and protection of
public forests; (ii) increasing productivity of designated forest lands and
other marginal lands; (iii) maintaining and improving biodiversity; (iv)
increasing private participation in sector development; and (v) improving
public forest management and development. Through these activities the project
would also increase the subsistence and incomes of fringe forest populations
many of whom are tribals or belong to the weaker sections of society.
9.    Pr6ject :gesriltinn.  The project would be implemented over a six-year
period and would cover the entire State of Andhra Pradesh. The project has two
interlinked parts: Firstly, the sector reforms that address the key sector
issues (paras 4 and 5 above) and aim to introduce viable institutional
arrangements and technology improvements, and to eliminate policy constraints
in the development of the forestry sector in the state; the first phase of the
project would concentrate on these sector reforms, including the building up
of technical support for physical project implementation. A Policy Statement,
including a Policy Reform Program for the forestry sector, agreed with IDA,
has recently been issued as a Government Order by GOAP which has confirmed its
commitment to carry out the reform program. Secondly, a set of investment



4
activities mainly related to land treatments on degraded land, which would
also start in the project's first phase, but the larger part of which would
take place in the project's second phase.
10.   The project would have three main investment components, each of them
breaking down into sub-components, as follows [estimated base costs and shares
of total project base costs are in brackets]:
(a)   Forest management investments, consisting of forestry works for
regeneration and rehabilitation development of about 355,000 ha of
degraded forest lands and other wastelands [US$ 47.6 million -
56.6% ].
(i)   Participatory rehabilitation of about 173,000 ha of forest
lands under joint forest management arrangements between
local populations and the Forest Department [US$ 18.5
million - 22.1%]:
(ii)  Production forestry, covering mainly regeneration works on
about 104,000 ha of forest lands by the Forest Department
(83% of this area) and the Forest Development Corporation
(17%) - [US$ 20.8 million - 24.6%]; and
(iii) Forestry development on about 77,000 ha of lands outside
designated forests, consisting of smallholder farm forestry
(45% of this area), and tree planting on community wasteland
(16%) and contiguous private wastelands (39%) - ET' $ 8.3
million - 9.9%].
(b)   Special action programs, including several key activities that
have been identified for strengthening under the project in
support of the above main investment components and sector reform
program [US$ 27.1 million - 32.3%].
(i)   Technological improvements in plant propagation and
associated forestry research [US$ 9.0 million - 10.7%1;
(ii)  Support to the joint forest management process through
training, planning, and funding to NGOs who would assist
with joint forest management fUS$ 5.2 million - 6.2%1;
(iii) Improvement of wildlife and Protected Areas management
[US$ 6.5 million - 7.7%];
(iv)  A collaborative fodder program, consisting of support to
adaptive fodder research and fodder development on degraded
forest land [US$ 0.4 million - 0.5%]; and
(v)   A Tribal Development Plan, under which funds would be
provided for non-forest activities, complementary to the
joint forest management program, to tribal groups in the



5
state [US$ 6.0 million - 7.2%].
(c)   Service support for the Forest Department, comprising buildings:
vehicles and equipment; training of staff; studies and technical
services for institutional development, the development of
information systems and forest surveys; and production of forestry
educational material; as well as a small support component for the
Forest Development Corporation [US$ 9.4 million - 11.1%].
11.  kPr6jgt l Anlementati6L.  The project would be under the overall control
of the Energy and Forests Department (EFD) of GOAP as the nodal executing
department. The main executing agency would be the Andhra Pradesh Forest
Department (FD) which would coordinate the project activities with fringe
forest villagers, tree farmers and NGOs (which are important partners in the
project) and other concerned governmenr.  agencies.  Significant involvement
would come from the Forest Development Corporation (FDC), the Tribal Welfare
Department, the Animal Husbandry Department and to a lesser degree from the
Department of Agriculture. The proposed project is designed to tie in with
the existing NGO networks in the state originally created for forestry
activities with people involvement in the course of bilaterally financed,
social forestry projects. Such links are one of the key factors to ensure
success of the participatory process which would be closely monitored during
project supervision. Furthermore, no field investments in joint forest
management (JFM) would be supported prior to agreement on a site-specific
forest management plan with the villagers in each particular location. Since
this component constitutes almost 40% of the field investments for forestry
treatments under the project, it is a powerful incentive for the forestry
administration to take participatory forestry seriously.
12.   The total project cost is estimated at US $ 89.1 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US $ 6.9 equivalent (8%) and taxes
estimated at about US $3.1 million equivalent. IDA would finance SDR 55.6
million (US $ 77.4 million equivalent, 90% of the total costs, net of taxes,
covering 100% of the foreign exchange and 89% of local costs, net of taxes.)
Retroactive financing is provided up to an amount of SDR 1.44 million (US $
2.0 million equivalent) for expenditures incurred after March 31, 1993 to
accelerate project implementation, particularly for support to be provided to
FD and NGOs in beneficiary group formation, early improvements of nurseries,
and initiation of several important studies and technical services. A
breakdown of the project costs and the financing plan are in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. Project Completion Date is March 31, 2000
and Closing Date is September 30, 2000. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank group operations in India are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. A map showing the forest areas in Andhra Pradesh is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 12193-IN of January 24, 1994 is
being distributed separately.
13.   Sust inability.  The project is designed to set in place a system of
managing public forests jointly with local populations, which would ensure
that forest areas regenerated under this system have a good chance of high



6
productivity and long-term survival. This process is envisaged to lead to a
reduction of forest degradation and ultimately to an improvement in the
conditions of the state's forest resources. Increases in productivity,
expected to be substantial in all components with investments in forest
management, would reduce the pressure on remaining forests and at the same
time improve the prospects for farm and plantation forestry. With a
restructured and retrained forest administration Andhra Pradesh would be
better placed to plan and manage its forests, and with an improved regulatory
framework villagers, farmers, and the private commercial sector would have
more incentives for participatl4ng in asset-building forestry activities.
14.   Agreed Actions.  The main assurances obtained from GOI and GOAP during
project negotiations relate to the proposed institutional, technical and
policy roforms, as these reforms will essentially constitute the operational
framework for the project's implementation. These actions are summarized as
follows: InatitutioAal: (a) GOAP shall carry out the Tribal Development Plan
in a manner and timetable agreed with IDA; (b) GOAP shall, not later than
March 31, 1995, complete and discuss with IDA the institutional development
study and thereafter implement the results in accordance with a time-bound
action plan agreed with IDA; (c) GOAP shall (i) select staff for overseas
training under the project in consultation with IDA, (ii) upon completion of
such training, post such staff for at least three years in areas in which such
training was received, and (iii) ensure that research staff remain in post for
at least five years; (d) GOAP shall complete, not later than December 31,
1994, in consultation with IDA (i) the transfer of the required forestry staff
to the Wildlife Wing of FD, and (ii) the staffing of the Planning Cell of the
Wildlife Wing; (e) GOAP shall make available to FDC land of adequate site
quality in blocks of suitable size, and to be selected in accordance with
criteria agreed with IDA, for implementation of the high-yield planting
program under the project; and (f) GOAP shall select NGOs in accordance with
procedures and criteria agreed with IDA to assist in carrying out the project.
Tqchnical: (g) seedlings used for the project shall be suitably culled in the
existing nurseries; (h) GOAP shall appoint consultants acceptable to IDA, not
later than June 30, 1994, to assist in the design of the research program and
in plant propagation and (i) shall discuss with IDA, not later than October
31, 1994, the resulting program and promptly thereafter implement the program;
(j) GOAP shall complete, in consultation with IDA, not later than September
30, 1994, the study for the development of the integrated protected areas
network; (k) GOAP shall, in consultation with IDA, [a] not later than December
31, 1994, complete the overview forest inventory; (b] not later than June 30,
1995; (i) complete and operate the management information system, and (ii)
install the geographical information system; and tc] not later than December
31, 1995, complete, under principles agreed with IDA, the design of new-type
working plans for managing the forest estate, and shall thereafter initiate
their implementation; and (1) GOAP shall carry out the field investments in
each location under the JFM component in accordance with a microplan for JFM
between the villagers in that location and FD; each such plan to be prepared
in accordance with a methodology agreed with IDA. Policy: (m) GOAP shall
ensure that (i) JFM benefit sharing arrangements agreed between the villagers
and FD shall be adhered to and shall not be changed without prior approval of
IDA, and (ii) joint accounts between the villagers and FD will be used for JFM



7
field investments; and (n) GOAP shall {i) ensure that seedling distribution
shall follow a policy agreed with IDA and (ii) adjust the seedling prices
every year to cover the full production costs. Other: (o) GOAP shall, by
December 31, 1996, undertake in collaboration with GOI and IDA, a mid-term
review of the project and thereafter implement its recommendations; and (p)
GOAP shall implement a system satisfactory to IDA for channelling the funds
required for the project to the entities carrying out the project.
15.   Agreement was also reached at negotiations that the appointment of
consultants, acceptable to IDA, for (i) the preparation of an institutional
development study to assist in the restructuring of the forest administration
and (ii) developing the management information system and the geographical
information system are conditions of Credit effectiveness.
16.   Environmental Impact.  The environmental classification for the project
is category "B". The project would be very beneficial for the environment. It
is heavily oriented toward environmental improvement through local community-
based protection of forest areas and vegetative soil and moisture conservation
measures. The protection of any forest land will depend much more on a
contented fringe population than on legal prescriptions. Specific proposals
for wildlife and biodiversity, as well as for fodder development are also
included. The project investments would not necessitate resettlement. An
environmental impact review was carried out and the findings and
recommendations have been taken into consideration in the project design.
Forestry activities, especially the treatment practices, have been reviewed
from all relevant standpoints: silvicultural, socio-economic, soil and
moisture conservation, livestock and fodder, and biodiversity. The Tribal
Development Plan, the formulation of which was closely linked to the
environmental impact review, would ensure that tribal populations receive
project benefits in a culturally compatible way.
17. Xnstftuti6nal IMopot. The project is expected to foster a major change
in existing 4!orest policy from enforced forest protection to cooperation with
local communities, a feature that is gaining ground both inside and outside
the State of Andhra Pradesh and to which GOAP is strongly committed. The
project would leave the state with a streamlined and modernized forest
administration, improve cooperation between the latter and other public sector
departments or agencies, and improve the role in forest development by the
private sector and NGO's.
18.   Impant on Women.  Women are the predominant collectors of fodder,
fuelwood and NTFPs and would benefit considerably from the project. The
proposed JFM forestry treatment practices would significantly enhance
availability of many forest products that are collected to provide household
subsistence and secondary income. Effective participation of women in JFN
would be critical to curb illicit removals and to secure sustained management
in the resource. To facilitate the efforts to mobilize women the project would
involve NGOs in the formation of village protection committees in which women
would be full members. Women's village sub-committees would be established for
managing NTFPs. FD staff would undergo gender sensitization training, an women
would be given empowerment and management training. The efforts to incorporate



8
women in all aspects of the project would be supported by a new FD hiring
policy to encourage recruitment of women as forest guards, foresters, and
range officers - currently staffed 100% by men.
19.   Pro2ram Objectiva CatAgorias. The project is highly relevant to the
Bank's anti-poverty strategy in India. Most of the beneficiaries live around
or within forest areas. Fringe forest dwellers, including many tribals, tend
to belong to the weakest section of Indian society. Special safeguards are put
in place so that project activities take into consideration the interests of
these groups (landless, women; scheduled casts; tribals) which would
constitute over 50% of project beneficiaries. NGO involvement in formation of
local forest protection committees and in development of forest management
microplans would ensure that the needs of these groups would be heard and
taken into account.
20.   ProjAct Bengfita.  The project would improve management and protection
of nearly 400,000 ha of land (including non-forest land based activities under
the TDP) and would directly or indirectly increase the production of wood,
NTFPs and animal products, which would benefit primarily disadvantaged
sections of the rural population. About 700,000 househoLd of fringe forest
dwellers and small farmers, including about 150,000 tribal h-ouseholds, would
receive direct benefits from the project. About 80 million work-days of
employment would be generated in forest rehabilitation works, a benefit which
would be principally captured by the poorest and landless households.
Processors and marketers of wood and NTFPs would benefit from increased supply
of raw material. Most forest treatment practices, which constitute the main
investments under the project, yield satisfactory or better financial rates of
return. Returns to villager-treefarmers from treatment practices under JFM are
for the most highly attractive. The economic rate of return for the project as
a whole has been estimated at 20% over 30 years. The ERR is only moderately
sensitive to variations in the cost or benefit streams. The project would also
generate significant non-quantifiable benefits, such as: reduction of soil
degradation water run-off both on public and private lands and associated
downstream positive effects on rural production; biodiversity conservation in
protected areas; enhanced efficiency of the forestry administration; and
elimination of sector policy distortions, leading to a more efficient
allocations of resources, thereby increasing private sector involvement in
forestry development.
21.   Riska.  The main risks facing the project are (a) the degree of
commitment within some parts of participating GOAP departments to make the
necessary institutional and policy reforms envisaged in the project; (b) the
effectiveness of people's participation in forest management and development
for the sustained management of common and public lands; and (c) parts of
northern Andhra Pradesh experience unrest from naxalite groups, which may make
project activities there more difficult and risky. The first risk is being
addressed through an agreed sector policy reform program, issued as a
Government Order by GOAP, and through assurances. The project endeavors to
minimize the second risk by including comprehensive training for FD staff and
villagers in JFM principles and practices, building links with NGOs and other
government departments involved at the village level, and by rigorous



9
monitoring of the process. As JFM takes hold local populations would be
