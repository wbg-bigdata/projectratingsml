3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

3.1.1   The overall goal of the project was to facilitate the Borrower's efforts to implement the
development provisions of the Peace Agreement signed on September 2, 1996 between the Government of
the Philippines (GOP) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) through the speedy financing of
local development initiatives in the Special Zone for Peace and Development (SZOPAD). The specific
project development objective was to increase the access of the population in the poor and most
conflict-affected areas of SZOPAD to basic economic and social infrastructure, services and employment
opportunities. (The SZOPAD is composed of fifteen provinces and eleven cities in Mindanao and Palawan
Island.)

3.1.2   The project development objectives were clear. Apart from increasing employment opportunities,
the project aimed to provide basic community-based economic and social infrastructure. This reflected the
high priority of the GOP during the project preparation to provide immediate and visible assistance ("peace
dividends") to the SZOPAD, an area specified in the Peace Agreement as the focus of the development
effort. The priorities were also reconfirmed during the Consultative Group meeting in December 1996
where an agreement was reached between the GOP and the donor community to refocus the latter's
assistance and give priority to Mindanao in support of the Peace Agreement.

3.1.3   The objectives were consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 1996-1998
(Report No. 15362-PH, dated February 15, 1996), which gave high priority to poverty reduction through
effective policies and upgrading of social services to the poor. The long armed conflict had contributed to a
high incidence of poverty and under-development which deprived the SZOPAD of development assistance.
The project development objectives reflected the Bank's assistance strategy for Mindanao and focused on a
three-pronged approach: (a) the financing of long-term investment projects based on the priorities identified
in the GOP's Development Framework and Investment Priority Plan for Mindanao; (b) the fast-tracking of
existing Bank projects with components in Mindanao, especially in the SZOPAD area; and (c) the
financing of quick-response and effective development activities in SZOPAD. The third prong of the
Bank's strategy was addressed through the SZOPAD Social Fund Project. The choice of small-scale
infrastructure, rather than support to livelihood activities, was made in consideration of other major donors'
planned assistance that would address the needs of MNLF ex-combatants for livelihood activities. The
project objective of increasing access of the poor to basic economic and social infrastructure continues to
be relevant to the needs of the country as reflected in the current CAS (Report No. 24042-PH, dated April
30, 2002).

3.2 Revised Objective:

3.2.1   The objective of the project remained unchanged.

3.3 Original Components:

3.3.1   The project had two components, with a combined estimated cost of US$15.33 million:

(1) Financing for Subprojects (US$12.28 million - 80.1% of total projected costs). This component
provided grant financing to community groups, Peoples' Organizations (POs), Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs) and Local Government Units (LGUs) for small-scale, community-based subprojects
of social and economic infrastructure and services such as water and sanitation facilities, schools, health



                                                      - 2 -

stations/clinics, small/communal irrigation systems, post-harvest facilities and rural roads. Financing was
also made available for supplies, equipment and technical services related to the efficient operation and
delivery of infrastructure subprojects.

(2) Institutional Support for the Social Fund (US$3.05 million - 19.9% of total projected costs). This
component financed the services of the Social Fund's contracted staff, equipment and operating costs, as
well as technical assistance and training to help improve the Social Fund's operational, managerial and
administrative capacity.

3.3.2    The choice of the Social Fund was made in recognition of the inadequate capacity of potential
Government agencies to provide speedy and high quality development assistance in SZOPAD. It also
reflected the findings of the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review of the Bank's Social Fund portfolio in
1997 which found that Social Funds had proved to be effective instruments for responding to emergency
and post-conflict situations through the provision of basic infrastructure while rapidly creating short-term
employment opportunities. The project incorporated lessons learned from international best practices
identified in the QAG Review, including the need for a project management unit staffed with qualified
personnel hired on a contractual basis and offered remuneration packages competitive with the private
sector.

3.3.3    The infrastructure subproject proposals, submitted by individuals and groups of people living in
the SZOPAD, were screened and processed according to predetermined eligibility criteria. Since the
proposed infrastructure subprojects did not require detailed feasibility studies or long construction periods,
fast implementation was considered feasible. Direct contracting, safeguarded by the project's unit cost data
base (UCDB), was another element which facilitated the speedy processing of subprojects.

3.4 Revised Components:

3.4.1         The components remained unchanged throughout the life of the project. However, some
enhancements were made in the component activities and the strategies adopted as implementation
proceeded. These changes were made to address the actual situation and needs on the ground, as well as to
improve the project's implementation strategies.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

3.5.1    The project's quality at entry is rated as having been satisfactory.        The project design was
appropriate and the means to implement it, in terms of project management, procurement arrangements,
financial management and disbursement procedures, were in place. The project's quality at entry was
particularly enhanced because of strong Borrower's ownership as exemplified by the prompt issuance of an
Executive Order (EO) by the President to establish the SZOPAD Social Fund. The Bank's safeguard
policies were also addressed.

3.5.2    With the benefit of hindsight, however, the strong emphasis in the project design on fast
implementation meant that certain compromises had to be made with regard to the design features aimed at
assuring sustainability (i.e., support for operation and maintenance (O&M) planning, as well as compliance
with some safeguard policies on land acquisition and environment). These aspects were addressed in the
subproject selection criteria (donation of land and environmental assessment), but in retrospect it was too
optimistic to believe that thorough coverage of these would be compatible with the speedy implementation
of a number of subprojects. For example, the need for a legal instrument proving the land donation slowed
the processing of subprojects in many instances. An O&M "catch-up" plan to enhance sustainability and



                                                      - 3 -

environmental management had to be prepared during project implementation when weaknesses in these
areas were recognized. Implementation of these catch-up plans consequently required the extension of the
Loan's Closing Date for one year to ensure that the plans were adopted and their implementation sustained
by subproject beneficiaries.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:


4.1.1    The project achieved its objectives. The satisfactory rating reflects: (a) the impact of construction
under the project; and (b) the effectiveness of the project in supporting the development provisions of the
Peace Agreement. Each aspect is summarized below.

4.1.2    Impacts of the Infrastructure. By the end of the project, about 344,000 people (representing
3.5% of the total population of the SZOPAD area) were provided with new and/or rehabilitated economic
and social infrastructure.     The Impact Assessment Study (IAS), conducted in late 2000 by external
consultants found that 85% of the beneficiaries reported improved access to social and economic
infrastructure vis-à-vis the appraisal target of 60%. The IAS, other studies and field observations also
found positive socio-economic impacts of the infrastructure, such as: (a) school buildings provided a new
venue for learning and increased learning capacity of students; (b) road subprojects increased off-farm
income opportunities outside communities; (c) barangay or village health stations (BHSs) improved the
quality of health services; (d) domestic water-supply schemes allowed households access to safe drinking
water; (e) warehouses reduced post-harvest losses; and (f) irrigation schemes increased crop production and
farmers' income.

4.1.3    In the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), it was estimated that the beneficiaries would have
access to about 26,000 person-months of employment opportunities.                Based on the management
information system (MIS) of the Fund Management Office (FMO), about 39,188 person-months of
employment opportunities were created by the end of the project. These include an estimated 11,000
person-months of unskilled labor recruited by contractors from the communities. Analysis of a limited
number of completed contracts suggest that most contractors provided their own labor force, mostly from
within the SZOPAD.         However, the construction methods used did not encourage the adoption of
labor-intensive methods, which substantially reduced opportunities to engage local unskilled labor.       The
involvement of the beneficiaries in the construction was also less than anticipated.

4.1.4    Effectiveness in Assisting the GOP's Efforts to Provide Assistance in SZOPAD. The project
was a key instrument of the GOP to support the socio-economic development in the SZOPAD in
accordance with the 1996 Peace Agreement. It was the means to provide essential social and economic
infrastructure in the poor and most conflict-affected areas of the SZOPAD. It must be noted that in many
of the areas served, the project was the first public support provided to the communities in decades. The
project had several advantages in manifesting the Government's commitment to socio-economic
development in the SZOPAD in comparison to other interventions.               First, being a quick-response
undertaking, the project was capable of promptly demonstrating positive outcomes of the Peace Agreement
("peace dividends") on the ground. Second, its demand-driven approach enabled the establishment of
priorities in infrastructure in accordance with the needs of the communities, thus ensuring the efficient use
of limited funds.     Third, by giving priority to applications from MNLF communities, it gave them
confidence in the Government's commitment to the Peace Agreement. These key design features allowed
the project to be an effective means for the Government to provide much-needed and visible development
support in the SZOPAD.

4.2 Outputs by components:

4.2.1    (1) Financing for Subprojects (US$7.61 million actual costs).             The component is rated
satisfactory. The subprojects that were financed reflect the communities' priority needs. The FMO
developed a menu of subproject options for the communities to select the facilities they considered most
important. The menu was derived from "needs assessment" and other research work undertaken in the
targeted areas during project preparation. The table below shows the number of subprojects by type (see

4.2.2    Initial subproject implementation required the communities to provide the basic design for their
proposed subprojects. However, design of small-scale communal irrigation systems, access facilities
(roads, ports and causeways) and water supply schemes proved difficult for the communities to prepare as
they lack the technical expertise and financial resources to undertake surveys and to prepare detailed
engineering and feasibility studies. In response, the FMO later developed basic design standards and
provided the proponent-communities with technical design services for water supply and access facilities.
In addition, the Government's National Irrigation Administration assisted some proponent-communities in
the design of communal irrigation systems.

4.2.3    By the end of the project, a total of 6,820 applications for infrastructure subprojects had been
received by the FMO, reflecting the successful promotion and the need in the area for infrastructure
support. Of these initial applications, 2,784 were rejected as being ineligible. Adopting the project's
Operations Manual regarding subproject appraisal and selection criteria, 458 subprojects were funded by
the project. Another 450 subprojects were funded through the OPEC Fund for International Development's
loan. The main limiting factor dictating the small number of subprojects assisted was the limited amount of
funding available to the project (i.e., a total of only US$20 million from the Bank and OPEC).

4.2.4    During project preparation, sustainability was considered important and modalities to improve its
likelihood at subproject appraisal were proposed. These included ensuring that the beneficiaries could
afford O&M costs and that they would be involved in both design and supervision of the civil works. In
addition, due consideration was given to articulating the role of LGUs in O&M. This consideration was
generally followed up, as LGUs took up O&M responsibilities for most of the subprojects as required by
Government regulations. However, the role of the beneficiaries in the design and implementation was
reduced, mainly because of the pressure for speedy implementation. In the first year of implementation,
the FMO took on the responsibility for the subprojects' technical design following significant delays



                                                        - 5 -

because of capacity and funding constraints on the part of the beneficiaries. In this regard, there was less
involvement for the beneficiaries, which may have contributed to a lower than expected full ownership role
in some of the subprojects. The FMO and Bank Task Team recognized this concern as implementation
proceeded, and the FMO later contracted a number of NGO service providers to carry out training and
other activities for the communities to improve the prospects of adequate O&M and thereby enhance
sustainability. Unfortunately, for most of the subprojects the engagement of service providers occurred
well after completion and the results, in particular for some water supply and school subprojects, have not
been as desired.

4.2.5    (2) Institutional Support for the Social Fund (US$3.21 million actual costs). The component
was implemented satisfactorily. The rating reflects the achievements of the three key indicators identified
in the PAD: (a) operational, financing, administration systems and procedures established; (b) monitoring
and supervision procedures established; and (c) appropriate staff, equipment and facilities in place.
Operational, financial and administration systems and procedures were established and detailed in the
project's Policies and Guidelines and the Operational Manual which were completed prior to loan
effectiveness.    The Operational Manual specifically provided for subproject screening, the appraisal
process and disbursement procedures, as well as monitoring and supervision. The nomination of the
members of the Board of Directors (BOD) and the Executive Committee (EXCOM), as well as the
recruitment of core staff of the FMO, took place before the project became effective. The project's UCDB
was also developed, which guided the subproject costing. However, the development of the MIS took
longer than anticipated and it was not fully operational for almost two years. Similarly, the financial
management computer software initially had problems and its entry into full operation was made possible
only in March 2001; as a result, the project depended on its manual system. Nevertheless, the FMO
continued to improve its management in all aspects, in particular, by further upgrading the UCDB, the MIS
and the Operation Manuals as implementation progressed.

4.2.6    The PAD identified two other performance indicators to assess the implementation progress: (a) the
time elapsed between the date of receipt of proposals and the appraisal and approval of eligible subprojects;
and (b) the time elapsed between the subprojects' approval and the first disbursement of funds. Detailed
information to assess the first indicator was not available during the first year of the project. However,
data gathered in the second year indicated an average of twenty-two weeks, compared to the target of
twelve weeks. Consequently, the target for the third year was revised to fifteen rather than the original
target of eight weeks. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that these targets were not met, especially at the
beginning of the project and during peak periods (at one stage, the FMO was supervising 170 subprojects).
Overall, the average time for appraisal and approval of subprojects was nineteen weeks, with an eight-week
gap between appraisal and approval. For the second indicator, the average time for all subprojects between
approval and funds release was only eleven days, compared to the target of six to eight weeks. This is an
indication of the good quality of service provided by the FMO.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

4.3.1    No economic analyis of the project was carried out (see Annex 3 for an analysis of
cost-effectiveness).

4.4 Financial rate of return:

4.4.1    No financial analysis of the project or its components was carried out.

4.5 Institutional development impact:



                                                      - 6 -

4.5.1   The project had the following significant impacts on institutional development: (a) it has provided a
professional and competent FMO for this project and initially for the successor Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Social Fund Project (in which many of the staff have been subsequently
absorbed); (b) it showed that contracts could successfully be implemented on time, and with funds
safeguarded; (c) it allowed service providers (e.g., private contractors and NGOs) access to remote areas of
the SZOPAD which were previously inaccessible; and (d) it proved that LGU support and technical
assistance, with NGO partnerships in the strengthening of communities' ownership and management of
subprojects, are effective tools for enhancing sustainability.


5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

5.1.1   The occurrence of the climatic phenomenon La Niña in 1999 led to flooding and accessibility
problems in some parts of the project area. The Government offensive against another separatist group, the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), also delayed some contracts. Nevertheless, most of the works
were completed without significant cost overruns.         The IAS estimated that of the 368 subprojects
completed by the time of the study, 7% had been delayed because of adverse weather conditions and about
8% had been affected by armed conflict.

5.1.2   The Asian economic crisis, which started in 1997, also caused a shortage of Government
counterpart funds. As a result, the GOP requested the Bank in 1998 to increase the disbursement ratio of
subproject financing from 70% to 90% and the overall project disbursement ratio from 75% to 90%. The
required amendments of the Loan Agreement were made by the Bank.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

5.2.1   Releases of funds from the Special Account through the Department of Budget and Management
(DBM) were significantly delayed as a result of the change in Government leadership in January 2001 and
again in early 2002. This resulted in the FMO being unable to pay contractors on time which, in turn, led
to small contractors experiencing cash flow problems that delayed the works. However, the DBM did take
some remedial actions to prevent a reoccurrence of these events. The FMO also requested the Bank to
increase the project's Special Account from US$0.5 million to US$1.0 million in 1999, and the DBM
approved additional counterpart funds for the project following the one-year extension of the Closing Date
from December 2001 to December 2002.

5.2.1   Despite the provisions of the Loan Agreement and the agreed project Policies and Guidelines, the
BOD (on the recommendation of the EXCOM) approved in November 1999 a new compensation package
for FMO staff designed to convert their status from consultants to civil servants. This had demoralizing
effects on the FMO staff which contributed to the slow-down of project implementation. This was
subsequently addressed by the Bank and the National Government when the latter reinstated the original
compensation package.


5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

5.3.1   Design faults (either omissions or site-specific modifications required to standardized designs) were
reported in the IAS as responsible for some 7% of delays in implementation of subprojects. Nevertheless,


                                                     - 7 -

this did not significantly affect the overall implementation of the project.

5.3.2    The uneven capability and weak financial status of some contractors were also considered by the
FMO as major reasons behind other delays and consequent overruns in contract periods.                The IAS
estimated that almost 10% of subprojects were delayed as a result of contractor problems. The contractors,
on the other hand, felt that the FMO was underestimating expected durations and was too strict on
contractors that experienced delays by charging a penalty of one-tenth of 1% of the remaining contract
price per day's overrun, as stipulated in the contract.

5.4 Costs and financing:

5.4.1    The actual project cost was US$10.82 million. This is about 71% of the US$15.33 million
estimated at the time of appraisal. This may have resulted from lower subproject costs in dollar terms,
which arose from the devaluation of the Philippine Peso. The Bank's share of the project costs was
US$9.83 million compared with the amount of US$10.00 million estimated at appraisal.


6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

6.1.1    The standardized design adopted by the FMO for all civil works and the quality of construction of
most infrastructure favor the durability of structures and enhanced physical sustainability with minimal
O&M requirements. O&M depends to a large extent on local ownership and to the value attached by local
communities to subprojects. Most health stations and classrooms have been handed over to LGUs and the
Department of Education, with commitments made towards staffing and recurrent costs, thus increasing the
likelihood of subprojects' sustainability.      Warehouses and solar dryers add value to crops produced
(mainly maize, rice and seaweeds) and are thus likely to be well maintained by their users. Communal
irrigation systems were rehabilitated at two sites where functioning Irrigators' Associations already existed.
The rehabilitation has allowed farmers to have two cropping seasons and both schemes are reported to be
well maintained. The roads and drainage structures rehabilitated under the project were completed with
machinery to a high standard, and communities have been trained initially in preventive maintenance (with
follow-on assistance and supervision from some LGUs), and therefore these works are likely to be kept in
good condition.      According to the NGO-service provider which conducted the O&M training for
recipient-communities and facilitated the handing-over of subprojects' Books of Accounts to LGUs and
other government units, the great majority of the 388 subprojects they have worked on have established
organizational responsibilities and financing mechanisms for O&M.

6.1.2    Cause for concern remains with some school buildings and water and sanitation subprojects that
did not receive the above-mentioned capacity-building assistance. A number of school buildings were
constructed at the communities' requests, but in some areas teachers were not regularly available or it
became too expensive for the beneficiaries to subsidize the teachers' traveling and other incidental expenses.
In this regard, some buildings were not used to the optimum. For the water and sanitation subprojects,
these require a degree of organization and management that some recipient-communities still need to
establish. NGO support in the setting-up and training of water associations was not provided prior to
subproject implementation, although these were addressed as part of the catch-up plans which were mostly
prepared after the subproject completion. For these schemes, both the ownership and the efficient and cost
effective use of the subprojects have become problematic and a few schemes are currently not fully
operational or require some repair or rehabilitation. During the Bank's Implementation Completion Report



                                                     - 8 -

(ICR) mission, the Government committed to follow some of the investments located in the ARMM area
under the successor ARMM Social Fund Project (ASFP).

6.1.3    Taking the above into account, the overall rating for sustainability of the project is likely.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

6.2.1    As the FMO was created in response to the post-conflict development needs in the SZOPAD under
a specific EO, the FMO did not anticipate its continuous operation after the life of the project. The FMO
ceased to exist with effect from September 12, 2002 as per Executive Order 124. This new EO placed the
management of the remaining activities of the project, including management of the OPEC-funded schemes,
under the newly-created ASFP, also funded by the Bank. Nevertheless, to the extent that existing FMO
staff have moved and some have been considered to work for ASFP, the SZOPAD Social Fund Project has
provided a positive contribution to this follow-on project which will support broad-based institution
development objectives in ARMM, thus further enhancing prospects for sustainability.

6.2.2    Legal ownership of almost all the infrastructure subprojects has also been handed over to relevant
LGUs and government agencies. The transfer of accountability of the subprojects was accompanied by an
exercise involving key stakeholders and facilitated by an NGO service provider, whereby agreements on
O&M modalities were worked out and finalized.


7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

7.1.1    The Bank's performance is rated as satisfactory.          The Bank responded promptly to the
Government's request for donors' support in the SZOPAD that was made at the 1996 Consultative Group
meeting immediately after the signing of the Peace Agreement. Based on its experience elsewhere, the
Bank's preparation team presented the Social Fund as a possible option with the belief that it would be the
best instrument to provide support to small-scale infrastructure in a post-conflict situation.           The
implementation experience suggests that this was the right choice. The Bank team also successfully
consulted and engaged the Government counterpart in the preparation exercise and expedited it. The
preparation exercise was conducted with intensive and high quality inputs, such as in the legal
establishment of the SZOPAD Social Fund, the preparation of Policies and Guidelines and the
identification of eligible subprojects. Despite being the first Social Fund in the country, the project was
carefully prepared and well-designed, with inputs and technical assistance from Social Fund practitioners in
other countries. However, there was an oversight with regard to subproject O&M. Although the initial
project design included basic provisions for O&M, it did not elaborate detailed implementation
arrangements and specific support required. This was exacerbated by the project not engaging service
providers for community mobilization and organization at early stages of implementation.

7.2 Supervision:

7.2.1    The Bank's supervision is rated as having been satisfactory. During implementation, the Task
Team carried out supervision missions at least twice a year. Each mission was staffed with the relevant
technical experts, who looked into all key aspects of project performance and recommended necessary
actions where improvements are required. It is worth noting that each mission saw in-depth participation of
core members of the FMO that allowed for open discussions about emerging issues and agreements on



                                                    - 9 -

needed actions, which were mostly followed up immediately. The Task Team, core members of which were
based in the country and mostly remained throughout the life of the project, also provided regular follow-up
and maintained close contact and communication with Government oversight agencies and the FMO in
between regular supervision missions.

7.2.2    Critical actions taken by the Task Team included recommendations on O&M catch-up plans,
financial management improvements and requests to the Government for the fast release of counterpart
funding. Timely advice and technical and operational support to the FMO staff, and dialogue with various
Government stakeholders, significantly contributed to the fast disbursement of funds, the proactive
identification and resolution of emerging issues with regard to project implementation, and ensuring the
project's general adherence to Bank's safeguard policies and operational guidelines. It should also be noted
that the Task Team facilitated two other financing schemes that aligned their support to the project (the
OPEC Fund for International Development, with a US$10 million loan, and the Bank's Japan Social
Development Fund (JSDF) with a US$1.5 million grant). The Task Team also made an appropriate
decision of extending the Closing date of the Loan to allow the installation of adequate O&M
arrangements. Furthermore, the Task Team also provided inputs and closely coordinated with the team
responsible for processing the successor ASFP, focusing on the project's lessons and experiences, as well
as the required enhancements to increase the likelihood of sustainability and maximization of investments
and benefits.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

7.3.1    On the basis of the above, overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

7.4.1    The Borrower's performance is rated as satisfactory. Since the project's identification, there was
close cooperation between the Government and the Bank. The project was subsequently placed under the
Office of the President, and the members of the BOD and the EXCOM were designated by the President.
EO No. 445 which was signed on October 1, 1997 also allowed ample time for the project to start in 1998.
The FMO was established in early 1998 and staff were recruited immediately. A set of project Policies and
Guidelines and Operations Manual were prepared, and the Bank's approval was obtained.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

7.5.1    The Government's implementation performance is rated as having been satisfactory. The GOP
generally complied with the Loan Agreement's terms and conditions throughout the life of the project. It
obtained the Bank's approval for all amendments, including contracting modalities, before they were
adopted by the project. Counterpart funds were ensured, although delays in the release of approved Special
Account funds by the DBM impinged upon implementation and sometimes delayed payments to
contractors.   The Office of the President provided valuable support to the project, recognizing its
importance to the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement. In addition, actual disbursements
were in accordance with disbursement targets, making the project always in the top five disbursing projects
in the Philippines' portfolio.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

7.6.1    The implementing agency's performance is rated as satisfactory.          The implementation was



                                                   - 10 -

efficiently carried out by the FMO.        Rigorous supervision of subproject implementation and close
monitoring of contractors ensured that delays were kept to a minimum and that civil works were generally
completed to a high standard.      Similarly, financial management and reporting were of a high standard.
The FMO benefited from the recruitment and retention of highly qualified and experienced staff.
Continuity of employment, encouraged by a good compensation package, was an important factor in
ensuring that works were completed without interruptions. Similarly, the EXCOM provided effective
oversight for subproject processing and any subsequent contract variations. The FMO and EXCOM
strictly followed the Policies and Guidelines as well as the Operations Manual.

7.6.2    Progress reports have been submitted on time, the MIS and UCDB were developed and
continuously refined to a high standard, and the Bank's operational policies and guidelines were followed
throughout the implementation period.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

7.7.1    On the basis of the above, overall Borrower performance is rated as satisfactory.


8. Lessons Learned


§        A Social Fund is an effective tool for providing timely development assistance in post-conflict
situations. The characteristics and delivery system of a Social Fund allow for fast and direct disbursement
of funds which significantly reduce the frustration of beneficiaries who expect immediate positive results,
following the end of the conflict. Fund disbursement is relatively fast because of the following operational
and institutional arrangements: (i) minimum channels of approval; and (ii) direct contracting. Moreover,
being an autonomous entity, Social Funds can minimize political interference and allow for the objective
processing of subprojects based on agreed and transparent sets of rules.

§        Social preparation and technical capacity building activities enhance the project investments'
sustainability. The provision of organizational development and strengthening, awareness-raising and
capacity-building interventions during the early stage of subproject implementation is critical for the
effective and efficient O&M of subproject investments. NGOs and other service providers should be
contracted to provide training and technical assistance, including follow-up/regular visits to the end-users
to ensure O&M is continuing and being sustained effectively. However, this should be balanced carefully
vis-à-vis the urgency and need to have tangible investments on the ground.

§        The participation and commitment of LGUs in all stages of the subproject cycle is crucial,
however, the potential risks of such involvement also poses some challenges. The involvement of LGUs
in all stages of subproject development cycle facilitates technical and financial support to subproject
application, construction and O&M arrangements. On the other hand, there is a potential danger of
inappropriate political influence and elite capture, especially where there is still enmity between
participating groups (e.g., LGUs and the MNLF). These risks, however, can be mitigated by fully adhering
to a set of clear and transparent rules and procedures.

§        The implementation of subprojects under a community-demand driven approach requires
flexible but clearly defined parameters. The use of direct contracting is an effective tool in implementing
small but numerous packages. However, direct contracting should be supported by a regularly updated
UCDB to safeguard and to ensure consistency and transparency in the subproject quality and investment



                                                    - 11 -

costing.

§         The location or "home" of the agency implementing a quick-response and emergency
intervention is important in ensuring the desired pace, support and high quality of implementation.
The Office of the President (OP) is the right home for a project designed for post-conflict situation since it
confirms the Administration's high priority to start the first phase of rehabilitation work. Locating the
project in the OP: (a) strongly conveys the Government's commitment and support to the peace process; (b)
provides prestige and influence; and (c) facilitates immediate and full support from various Government
and private agencies.

§         Highly competitive remuneration is essential to attract and retain highly qualified staff,
especially in post-conflict and emergency work. The fast-track nature of activities and interventions in a
post-conflict environment requires highly qualified staff who have extensive experience, willing to work for
extended hours and are prepared to work in a sensitive environment. To be able to attract and retain this
kind of professional staff, a competitive compensation package should be provided.

§         A well-designed information, education and communication strategy is critical in supporting
project targeting and demand management approaches. The demand for assistance in any post-conflict
situation is always very high, usually far exceeding the available resources. It is important to have a clear
beneficiary targeting and information dissemination strategy to be able to focus and prioritize the use of the
limited resources for the target communities.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:

9.1       The project was conceived as an innovative and quick-response mechanism to address poverty at
the community level by taking people out of their passivity through a community-driven development and
participatory approach. It provided the communities the chance to decide for themselves what they
consider to be a priority intervention, instead of having their priorities decided for them by central
authorities.   This opportunity has empowered the communities to take communal responsibilities in
identifying their own problems and in finding ways to solve them. In addition, LGUs' awareness of
community-driven development has been raised. The risk of LGUs taking advantage of the opportunities
created through the subproject financing was minimized by the adoption of transparent eligibility criteria
and broad promotion campaigns.

9.2       While it is true that the project cost was a drop in the bucket in terms of satisfying the needs of
the targeted communities, the project has generated social development processes that led to significant
increases in self-esteem, trust and cooperation among benefited community groups. Communities were
able to articulate their needs and participate in the implementation of demand-driven subprojects. The
findings of the IAS showed a high degree of satisfaction among the recipient-communities which is a good
prospect for a sustainable social development process as well as the economic and social benefits of the
project.

9.3       The SZOPAD Social Fund, being an autonomous institution, provided the necessary independence
in subproject identification and financing based on transparent eligibility criteria and procedures. This
important characteristic of the project has minimized the risk of political interference which contributed to
its satisfactory implementation.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

No cost-benefit analysis methodology was used in the preparation of the PAD as the actual activities to be
financed were demand driven and hence the benefits could not be accurately quantified during appraisal.
Consequently, the ICR mission did not applied cost-benefit analysis to calculate net present value (NPV) or
economic rate of return (ERR) because data are not available and time constraints precluded the collection
of the comprehensive data required.

Although project benefits are difficult to quantify, the following should be noted:

l The project had a number of intangible benefits, notably: (a) it has provided one of the building blocks
     to the peace process between the GOP and the MNLF; (b) it has built capacity of a number of small
     private contractors; and (c) it has shown that contracts can be implemented quickly, within cost
     estimates and to a high standard.

l More tangible benefits have been provided for the beneficiaries of the subprojects, in particular: (a)
     improved access to health and education facilities; (b) an increase in crop production; (c) improved
     access to safe drinking water supplies and sanitation facilities; and (d) quicker and less difficult access
     for farmers and fisherfolk to markets.

Costs have been collected and collated on a regular basis for inclusion in the UCDB. An important role of
the UCDB was to have an objective cost basis in estimating and implementing contracts. The UCDB was
considered essential    to permit the cost effective implementation of direct contracting.          The direct
contracting is carried out on the basis of advising contractors of the contract price determined using the
UCDB plus a straight 10% profit margin. Direct contracting in the Philippines is an efficient way to fast
track the awards and implement the contracts. As contracts were relatively small and with small profit
margins, many small contractors were attracted to the project, thus building capacity for this part of the
private sector.

The cost effectiveness of the civil works' unit costs per square meter for a typical two-room school building
is illustrated below. Note that the designs used by the different agencies involved in school construction are
generally similar, with only small variations in floor sizes and corridors. Overall comparison is possible on
a unit cost basis and the table below compares five examples (data as of December 2002):

 Social Expenditure Management Program (World Bank-funded)                             PHP4,106
 Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH)                                        PHP5,607
 Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (private contractors)               PhP6,428
 Third Elementary Education Project (World Bank-funded                                 PhP8,298



The class-rooms built under the SZOPAD Social Fund and the Third Elementary Education Project are of
the highest quality with toilets and fittings as required. Those of DWPH usually were not painted or did
not have ceilings fitted and were generally considered the poorest quality. Other agencies constructed
class-rooms of varying quality.
