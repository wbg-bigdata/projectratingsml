        described in Section 3.01(a) and (b) of this Agreement based on evidence
        satisfactory to the Bank:

        (a)    with the progress achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the Program;
                                        - 10 -

     (b)     that the Guarantor is maintaining a macroeconomic policy framework
             which does not jeopardize the objectives of the Program;

     (c)     that the Borrower’s expenditure program, and fiscal arrangements with
             the Guarantor, are consistent with the objectives of the Program; and

     (d)     that the actions described in Part A of Section I of this Schedule for the
             purposes of the First Withdrawal Tranche, and in Part B of Section I of
             this Schedule for the purposes of the Second Withdrawal Tranche, have
             been taken.

     If, after this exchange of views, the Bank is not so satisfied, it may give notice to
     the Borrower to that effect and, if within ninety (90) days after the notice, the
     Borrower has not taken steps satisfactory to the Bank, with respect to paragraphs
     (a), (b), (c) and (d) above, then the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, cancel
     all or any part of the Unwithdrawn Loan Balance.

E.   Deposits of Loan Amounts. Except as the Bank may otherwise agree:

1.   all withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into
     Banco do Brasil S/A, Banco Nº 001, Agência Nº 9863-9
     (COGER/GECOE/DEBAM-DF), Conta-Corrente nº 24245-7200-8, as found
     acceptable to the Bank; and

2.   the Borrower shall ensure that upon each deposit of an amount of the Loan into
     this account, an equivalent amount is accounted for in the Borrower’s budget
     management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank.

F.   Excluded Expenditures. The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the
     Loan shall not be used to finance Excluded Expenditures. If the Bank determines
     at any time that an amount of the Loan was used to make a payment for an
     Excluded Expenditure, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank,
     refund an amount equal to the amount of such payment to the Bank. Amounts
     refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

G.   Closing Date. The Closing Date is June 30, 2013. The Bank will grant an
     extension of the Closing Date after the Guarantor’s Ministry of Finance has
     informed the Bank that it agrees with such an extension.

                            Amortization Schedule

1.   The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the
     percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal
     Payment Date (“Installment Share?). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully
     withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the
     Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be
     determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the
     first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal
     Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
     amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
     Conversion applies.

2.   If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal
     Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on
     each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

     (a)      To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of
              the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the
              Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1
              of this Schedule.

     (b)      Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be
              repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
                                      - 20 -

            withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the
            amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is
            the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this
            Schedule for said Principal Payment Date (“Original Installment Share?)
            and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
            Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such
            date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
            amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
            Conversion applies.

3.   (a)    Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar weeks prior to any
            Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the
            principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as
            withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
            following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each
            Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment
            Date following the date of withdrawal.

     (b)    Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
            at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which
            invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the
            provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any
            withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

      Bank) of the quotations. If less than two quotations are provided as
      requested, the rate for the Interest Period shall be the arithmetic mean (as
                               - 27 -

      determined by the Bank) of the rates quoted by four major banks selected
