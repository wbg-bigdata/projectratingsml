MEMORANDUM AND RECONHENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOM A FOURTH FISHEEIS DEVELOgMENT PR,JECT
1.        I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed credit to the Republic of Yemen (ROY) for SDR 9.4 million
(US$13.2 million equivalent) for approval. The proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms with 40 wears maturity and would help finance the
Fourth Fisheries Development Project, estimated to cost US$39.8 million.
Co-financing, totalling US$22.8 million equivalent, would be provided by
the Commission for European Communities (EEC) and the International Fund
for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The Government of ROY would
contribute the remaining US$3.8 million equivalent of the project cost.
2.        Economic Situation.  The recent unification of the Yemen Arab
Republic (YAR) and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) has
brought together two economies with different orientations. The new
country has modest oil and considerable gas reserves, unexploited tourism
potential, large fishery resources, a strategic location, and a larger
domestic market to achieve higher economies of scale. However, the
combined economy is also faced with serious macro-imbalances, whicit need
to be addressed urgently. Virtually all production in both parts of the
country goes to consumption, and gross domestic savings have been
negative. Consequently, investments in both parts of the country have
been financed by external resources, in the form of workers' remittances,
grants or loans; this high dependence on external borrowings has created a
precarious external debt situation. With large budget and balance of
payments deficits and increasing inflationary pressures, the country faces
serious macro-economic instability. These imbalances, already aggravated
by the difficulties inherent in unification, were further affected by the
recent crisis in the Middle East, which has resulted in reduced
remittances and further exacerbated the serious unemployment situation in
the country.  The Bank provided advice on restoring a viable balance to
both the YAR and PDRY before unification, and will continue to do so in
ongoing dialogue with the new Government.
3.        The Fisherigs Sector. The coastline of ROY extends for about
2,000 kilometers; of these 1,500 kilometers are in southern Yemen along
the Gulf of Aden (Map, IBRD 22548). The most productive fishery grounds
are considered to lie off the southeastern coast of the country. The
output of the fishing sector of the united country is roughly estimated 't
about 107,000 metric tons (mt), about 80 percent of which comes from the
south. The sector provides employment for some 16,000-18,000 people.
4.        The project was appraised prior to the unification of the two
Yemen republics and was designed specifically to assist the fishery sector
in ex-PDRY. Subsequent to unification, the project's design was reviewed
jointly by ID4 and the Government to ensure that it continued to address
the principal constraints of the sector. IDA and other foreign lenders



-2-
have already made substantial investments in the fisheries sector in
northern Yemen, and no substantial additional programs are envisaged for
the next few years. The proposed project does, however, allow for
extending to the north activities related to fish resource management and
the marine environment.
5.        In southern Yemen (ex-PDRY), the total annual catch has averaged
some 85,000 mt since 1984, with a peak of 91,000 mt in 1986. Reported
catch data indicate that the share of foreign vessels has decreased
rapidly--from 54 percent of the total catch of southern Yemen in 1986 to
41 percent in 1988; meanwhile, the share of the traditional fleet has
increased from 37 percent to 52 percent over t0e same period. Overall,
the data clearly indicates that, with a few exceptions, most of the
available fish resources in ROY waters are underexploited, and catch
levels can be significantly increased on a sustainable basis. However,
the sector's ability to do so is severely limited since virtually the
entire Yemeni industrial fleet, and a substantial portion of traditional
wooden vessels, are at the end of their useful economic life; the early
models of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) vessels also need replacement.
Small-scale fishing in the south takes place from about 50 villages along
the coast and employs about 6,400 fishermen, who are supported by 13
fisheries cooperatives. In the past these cooperatives owned fishermen's
boats and sometimes their gear. Recently introduced changes have resulted
in liberalization of fish marketing and in rationalizing the activities of
the cooperatives. Overall, the Government is in the process of
transforming a centrally planned and largely controlled fisheries sector
into one that effectively combines private, cooperative and public
activities under an economy directed by market forces.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The ROY has few alternatives for
development; fisheries and the mineral oil deposits are the only
significant resources which offer substantial potential. Recognizing that
previous fisheries sector policies did not achieve desired objectives, the
Government of the former PDRY started to adjust the policy framework in
1987, focussing on developing nonindustrial fisheries, which were more
productive.  In response to the Government's request for continued support
for the traditional fishing subsector, IDA carried out a review of the
PDRY fisheries sector, which led to considerable discussions with the
Government on sector development policies and issues.  The proposed
project would essentially be a follow-up to the prior IDA-financed
projects; it would also support the ongoing sector adjustment process and,
in particular, institutional development in the artisanal fisheries
sector. Earlier IDA-financed projects focussed on the development of
villages along the western part of the country's southern coast; the
proposed project would finance village facilities along the eastern part
of the coast.
7.        Lessons Learned.  IDA has helped the Government develop the
fisheries sector of Yemen through three credits, and a supplementary
credit for the south, and one credit for the north, totaling US$36.5
million equivalent. These credits financed boat building, engines,



.3-
fishing gear, improved fishing vessels, fish processing, storage and
marketing facilities, fishing port, and a manpower training center. The
implementation of these projects has generally been successful; however,
there have been problems in the design and management of some of the
facilities built. The experience has provided the following guidelines
for future projects: (i) agreement should be reached on implementation
schedule for key activities, procurement plans, and cost estimates prior
to Board presentation, to avoid delays in the start of implementation;
(ii) attention should be given to the actual requirements of the people
for whom the facilities are intended, and care should be taken to ensure
that the fishermen fully comprehend and agree to the facilities to be
provided; (iii) agreement should be reached, prior to implementation,
between the Government, the beneficiaries and the lenders on policy
issues, such as cost recovery, management agreements, and pricing; and
(iv) realistic projections of fish catches, species composition, prices
and markets should be used during appraisal. These lessons have been
incorporated into the design of the proposed project.
8.        Prolect Objectives.  The main objectives of the project are to:
(i) expand fish catches and improve processing, for both local consumption
and export; (ii) improve the efficiency of the domestic and export
marketing of fish, notably through investments, policy changes and
adjustments in the institutional performance of cooperatives;
(iii) improve the assessment and management of the fish resources; and
(iv) help improve the position of women in fishing communities.
9.        Proiect Description. The project would provide for:
(i) construction of primary facilities for fish handling in seven villages
and of a road between two fishing villages to improve access; (ii) import
of: intermediate technology vessels, construction material for fishing
boats, outboard engines and fishing gear, and a fleet of insulated and
refrigerated trucks and plastic boxes for fish marketing; (iii) technical
assistance for the Coastal Fisheries Corporation (CFC), the National
Corporation for Fish Marketing (NCFM), cooperatives and Ministry of
Fisheries (HF); (iv) strengthening of the Marine Science and Resources
Research Institute's (MSRRI) fish stock assessment and resource management
program and environmental research capability; and (v) services for women
in fishing communities.
10.       The project would be implemented over a period of seven years.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$39.8 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$31.8 million (79 percent). The IDA
credit of US$13.2 million equivalent would finance 33 percent of project
costs and 41 percent of foreign exchange costs; the co-financiers would
finance 57 percent of project costs, while the Government would finance 10
percent of project costs. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Procurement methods, with amounts, and disbursements
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events is given in
Schedule C, and the status of Bank Group operations in ROY is given in
Schedule D. A map (IBRD 22548), and the Staff Appraisal Report
No. 8429-YEN dated May 20, 1991 are also attached.



-4-
11.       Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, agreements were reached on
conditions necessary for successful project implementation. Prior to IDA
credit effectiveness, the following actions would be required:
(i) Government's ratification of the restructuring plan for the fisheries
cooperatives, which is aimed at reducing administrative overhead costs,
introducing an agreed fee schedule for cooperative services, and ensuring
the financial viability of the cooperatives; (ii) execution of a Special
Fund Agreement between MF and the Cooperative and Agriculture Credit Bank
for establishing a targeted credit program for poor fishermen, which would
be financed by MF; and (iii) the effectiveness of formal loan/grant
agreements for the project with other co-financing organizations. In
addition, the Government agreed to strengthen the PIU and provided
assurances that: (i) an agreement would be reached with the fisheries
cooperatives prior to the tendering of the construction contract on (a)
the final design and layout of the village facilities to be financed under
the project, and (b) their cost recovery; (ii) cooperatives would
transfer, through a hire-purchase scheme, ownership titles of boats to
fishermen, as well as related maintenance responsibilities; and (iii) the
Government would ensure compliance with measures to protect the
environment.
12.       Benefits.  The project's primary economic benefit would be the
incremental fish landings, estimated to reach some 11,000 mt/year at full
development. The increased production would lead to more abundant fish
supplies for the domestic market and some 750-1,250 mt of additional fresh
fish exports annually; this would generate foreign exchange earnings of up
to US$1 million per year at full development. Another important benefit
of the project would be the reduction in losses suffered from spoilage and
damage, as a result of better organized fish collection and delivery to
the main processing and consumer centers. Increased fish supply would
help satisfy the nutritional needs of the poorer sections of the
population, as fish is the cheapest available source of protein in the
country. The financial rates of return of the boats financed under the
project range from 24 percent to 56 percent. The economic rate of return
of the project is estimated at 31 percent.
13.       Risks. There is some risk that the recent unification of the two
Yemens, and the resulting reorganization of various institutions, could
slow down project implementation. A second concomitant risk is that
economic reform may be slowed down due to difficulties experienced during
the period of transition. However, a review of changes shows that the
post-unification structure of MF has good continuity with past operations.
Furthermore, MF has shown a clear commitment to the ongoing sector
adjustment process. A third risk is related to the likely difficulty of
restructuring the fisheries cooperatives and of addressing their
management problems. The Government has proposed a plan, acceptable to
IDA, for the financial improvement of the fisheries cooperatives;
ratification by the Government of the plan is a condition of credit
effectiveness. The Government is fully aware of these risks and has
shown, during project preparation, a strong commitment to push ahead with



.5.
the necessary policy and institutional changes. The project also provides
for an interim review to examine the need for change, if any, in the
design and scope of the project and to incorporate lessons learned in its
implementation.
14,                         1 am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
