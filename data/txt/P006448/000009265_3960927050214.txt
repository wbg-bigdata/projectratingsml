MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE STATE OF PARANA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE LAND MANAGEMENT I PROJECT - PARANA
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the State of Parana with the guarantee of the Federative Republic of Brazil
for US$63.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed
loan would be repayable in 15 years on a fixed amortization schedule,
including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
It would help finance a statewide land management and soil conservation
project.
2.       Background.  In the 1970s, agricultural growth in Brazil averaged
6Z per annum based largely o.a the expansion of export crops (soybean,
citrus, tobacco, coffee and cocoa) and sugar cane for the alcohol program.
In the early 1980s, the sector entered a period of relative stagnation,
caused in part by overall macroeconomic difficulties, limitations in the
availaibility of rural credit, consumer price controls, and falling world
commodity prices. In addition, Brazil is experiencing declining
productivity for various food crops. In large part, this is the result of
soil erosion owing to increased mechanization. Although particularly
pronounced in the older agricultural areas -- especially the South -- it is
also becoming a significant problem in the South-East and Center-West. In
addition to reducing productivity and farmer net income, soil erosion has
also been responsible for the silting of rivers and dams, flooding, water
pollution and the destruction of local ecosystems. It can be halted and
prevented through the participation of all farmers in a microcatchment area
in a program of improved land management. In the past, however,
traditional soil conservation approaches have largely depended on costly
runoff control structures which required substantial subsidies and produced
delayed benefits. More advanced techniques, which are less costly and have
a shorter payoff period, focus more on improving the vegetative cover of
the soil and improving soil structure and drainage through reduced tillage
and improved cultivation techniques. The use of these advanced techniques,
however, has not been widespread in Brazil. Constraints include the need
to: (a) improve the efficiency of incentives used to promote on-farm and
off-farm soil conservation activities; (b) increase research to adapt soil
conservation techniques to the different types of erosion within Brazil;
and (c) increase the number of extension agents and farmers trained in
conservation techniques.
3.       The State of Parana has a modern agricultural sector with well-
staffed and competent agricultural agencies and a well-organized farming
community, both eager to tackle land management issues. in 1983, the state
initiated a Soil and Water Integrated Management Program (IPMISA). This
program, in its early stages, relied mainly on traditional approaches based
on expensive mechanical structures supported by a costly incentive program.
Recently, the technical strategy has been improved to include more modern
soil conservation concepts and to attract farmers, organized into
microcatchment farmer associations, by offe-ing immediate increases in
productivity, rather the than delayed bene.its characteristic of more



traditional approaches to soil conservation. However, financial and
technical constraints have prevented a more rapid and better focused
expansion of the program.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's assistance strategy in
Brazil is to support policies and investments that will encourage economic
growth and social development in the context of macroeconomic stability.
The emphasis is on efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in
the public sector, and the appropriate targeting and delivery of support
systems to the poor. Improved resour- allocation and continued growth in
the agricultural sector are part of tais overall strategy. Increasing soil
erosion problems in the South and South-East threaten to undermine past
efficiency gains on the country's most intensely utilized and productive
farmlands. Through its support for the proposed project, the first in a
series of pioneer state projects, the Bank would help launch and establish
on a state-wide scale innovative approaches for economically viable
investment in soil conservation and overall land management. The project
would combine the existing participatory philosophy based on microcatchment
farmer associations with an integrated and well-focused technical strateg)
supported by an effective incentive program and implemented by trained
extension agents.
5.       ProJect ObJectives.  The proposed project would increase
productivity, improve the Parana farmers' net incomes and safeguard state
natural resources for the future through increased adoption of sustainable
modern forms of land management and soil and water conservation. The
results would be increased farm profitability, while soil loss, the silting
of river beds and reservoirs, floods, the destruction of rural roads,
falling water tables, pollution of water sources and depletion of natural
resources would be reduced. The project would also strengthen the State of
Parana's capacity to implement more efficiently an expanded state-wide land
management and soil conservation program.
6.       Project Description.  The proposed project would be the first
Bank-assisted land management and soil conservation project in Brazil.
Some 165,500 farmers -- most of them -mall-scale -- residing in 2,100
selected microcatchments covering 25? of the state area and distributed
among the state's 311 municipalities, would directly benefit from the
project. The project would promote actions to: increase the extent and
duration of vegetative cover of the soil, better protecting it from sealing
under intense rainfall; improve internal soil structure and drainage,
increasing water infiltration; and safely dispose of any remaining runoff,
either within or outside farm boundaries. Activities would include: (a)
adaptive research focusing on improved soil cover and soil structure (132
of total costs); (b) public and private extension services to assist in
planning and execution of microcatchment soil conservation plans (182 of
total costs); (c) financial assistance to microcatchment farmer
associations through an incentive program which would provide partial
grants for land management, soil conservation and pollution control works
which result in wider social and economic benefits (18? of total costs);
(d) erosion control works along rural roads to reduce erosion in the
microcatchments (26S of total costs); (e) rail terminal facilities to
reduce transport costs of lime, an input often crucial to achieving rapid
crop cover (52 of total costs); (f) commercial and conservation forestry
and environmental studies to develop reforestation and protect state parks
and forest reserves, including conservation activities for the Parana
section of the Serra do Mar Conservation Project (10? of total costs);



- 3 -
;gj land use monitoring and control (4Z of total costs); (h) project
administration: monitoring and evaluation (3O of total costs); and (i)
training (4Z of total costs). As a complementary activity to the project,
the official credit system and participating banks under the Bank-assisted
Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 2971-BR) would provide project
beneficiaries with on-farm investment credit. Project activities would be
executed by state agencies coordinated by the Secretariat of Agriculture
and Supply (SEAB). A Project Administrative Unit (AU) within SEAB would
monitor project planning and implementation through SEAB Regional Offices
in coordination with municipal microcatchment commissions.
7.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$138.3 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$19.7 million (14z).
The project, to be carried out over seven years, provides funds for: civil
works; equipment and furniture; an incentive program for on-farm land
management, soil conservation and pollution control works, which would be
gradually phased out during project implementation; technical assistance
and studies; training; and, on a declining basis, related incremental
administrative and operating costs. The incentive program, through the
establishment of a Soil Conservation (SC) Fund, would consolidate, and
thereby reduce, various existing state subsidies for soil conservation and
pollution control. -'he SC Fund of US$22.0 million (excluding price
contingencies) representing about 7.52 of total on-farm investments would
provide grants, on a declining basis, to partially finance soil
conservation subprojects in accozdance with procedures, criteria, grant
rates and limits as provided for in an Operational Manual which has been
agreed on with the Bank. Grants would be entirely phased out by the end of
project implementation as the benefits of the program become more visible
to the farmers. Full operation and maintenance costs for rail terminals
would be charged to lime consumers and project beneficiaries would pay,
from Year 4 onwards, the full cost of green manure seed and planting
material fcr commercial forestry. Retroactive financing of about US$2.5
million would be provided for initial project expenditures incurred during
a period of about eight months after July 7, 1988, but prior to loan
signing. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements and the
disbursement achedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank group operations in Brazil are
given in Schedule C and D, respectively. Three maps, and the Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7435-BR, dated December 8, 1988, are also attached.
8.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the State Government agreed
on the following actions: (a) as a condition of loan effectiveness: signing
of the operating agreements satisfactory to the Bank between SEAB and the
various project executing and collaborating agencies which were reviewed
and agreed upon in substance during negotiations; (b) as a condition of
disbursement for erosion control works along rural roads, receipt by the
Bank of a satisfactory draft model of a contract for typical erosion works;
and (c) as other conditions: (i) implementation of the SC Fund in
accordance with the agreed Operational Manual; presentation to the Bank of
a satisfactory Technical Manual for land management and soil conservation
not later than July 31, 1989; and a review with the Bank not later than
July 31, 1993, to examine the possibility of accelerating the phasing out
of the incentive program; (ii) satisfactory contractual arrangements with
each municipality for the maintenance of rural road sections improved under
the project; (iii) proof of land ownership and detailed engineering designs
for the five rail terminals under the project, annual review of their
financial performance, and study during the project mid-term evaluation of



- 4 -
the possibility of involving the private sector in their operation; (iv)
satisfactory terms of reference to be provided by July 31. 1989 for the
Serra do Mar firs-. series of studies and inventories; (v) maintenance of
the Project Administrative Unit with competent staff, structure and
functions, all satisfactory to the Bank; (vi) a baseline evaluation to be
provided by July 31. 1989; and (vii) satisfactory mid-term and ex-post
evaluation reports by July 31, 1993 and March 31, 199., respectively.
9.       Benefits.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from increases in agricultural production throught (a) sustainable
productivity gains; (b) a slight rise in cropping intensity; and (c) land
use improvements. At full development about 752 of the value of annual
incremental output value (US$210 million) would come from five main crops
(soybean, wheat, maize, edible beans and coffee) and 25Z from
diversification into fruit treas, commercial forestry products, and
improved pasture. The internal rate of return calculated for the directly
productive components with readily quantified economic benefits is
estimated at 242. Expanded agriculture activities would create employment
equivalent to some 15,000 man years annually. Other benefits would include
reduced road maintenance costs and water source pollution, lower risk of
flooding, reduced pressure on remaining native forests to supply fuelwood,
and improved protection of local ecosystems.
10.      Risks.  The principal risk of the project is that the interest
among the farming community in controlling soil erosion could fail to
expand as a result of: a) farmers' reluctance to use commercial investment
credit for conservation activities in the current uncertain and
inflationary economic environment; b) insufficient interinstitutional
cooperation: and c) shortfalls in counterpart funding. The project has
been designed to minimize these risks. The establishment of the Soil
Conservation Fund to assist microcatchment farmer associations in financing
soil conservation and pollution control works, the availability of green
manure crop seeds and of planting material for commercial forestry
development, the substantial reduction in transport costs of lime, and the
overall participatory philosophy of the project should encourage farmers to
invest in soil conservation activities. The integration of most project
executing agencies under the author: y of the Secretariat of Agriculture
and Supply, the setting up of a strong monitoring and evaluation system,
and intensive staff training should ensure efficient project coordination.
Finally, the state's relatively good financial status and the support the
project enjoys among state authorities should help secure adequate
counterpart funding.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and reconmend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
