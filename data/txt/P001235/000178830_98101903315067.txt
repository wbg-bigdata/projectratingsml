APPRAISAL OF THE NAIROBI AIRPORT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        With the great majority of tourists arriving in Kenya dependent
upon international air transport and 12% of all foreign exchange earned by
Kenya coming from its tourists, the Government considers the development of
Nairobi Airport to be among its highest investment priorities. Kenya, located
along the east coast of Africa, lies on the equator and variations in altitude
provide a wide range of climatic conditions and topography. Its wild game
reserves and beautiful white beaches are extremely attractive to visitors.
The city of Nairobi is not only the center for surface transportation within
the area and general aviation within East Africa but Nairobi Airport is a
major intersection and transit point for international air routes. Traffic
at the airport is expected to reach saturation levels by 1975 and the airport
needs to be expanded. The Government engaged the consulting firms Sir Alexander
Gibb and Partners (Africa) and Gibb, Petermuller and Partners to develop traf-
fic forecasts and prepare a master plan for airport development, to be follu.-
by detailed engineering for the first stage construction. Their report forms
the basis for the proposed project.
ii.       This will be the Bank Group's ninth transportation project in Kenya
and the first for aviation. It will consist of the first stage development
of the airport and the strengthening of the new Aerodromes Department of the
Ministry of Power and Communications. A new international and domestic ter-
minal building and apron will be constructed, a parallel taxiway will be
provided, a freight complex, fire and police stations, canteen, State Pavill.-
and Control Tower will be constructed, taxiway, apron and approach lighting
will be installed, and access roads and other support facilities will be
provided. Technical assistance in the form of experts and specialized consult-
ing firms will be provided to the Department along with training for selected
personnel of the Department.
iii.      The project will allow the airport to grow in orderly stages
toward its ultimate development without restraints to traffic growth and
will assist in the formation of a strong organization capable of an effi-
cient and cost-conscious operation of the airport. Execution of the projec-
would be the responsibility of the Aerodromes Department. Consultants em-
ployed to carry out the final design and supervision of construction have
almost completed the design work upon which the cost estimates are based.
Construction is expected to be carried out under five separate contracts,
to be awarded through international competitive bidding.
iv.       Of the total project cost, estimated at US$46.3 million equiva-
lent, the proposed Bank loan of US$29.0 million would finance the foreign
exchange component of approximately 63%. The loan would be to the Govern-
ment of Kenya. The local cost component would be provided by the Govern-
ment.



- ii -
v.        The airport has been financially profitable and a dependable
source of revenue to the Government. The present level of user charges
at the airport is high and reflects Nairobi's present strong competitive
position, but the charges are not directly related to the various costs
incurred. New charges based on costs of facilities and services involved
will be devised and implemented to assure the continuing profitability of
Nairobi Airport against increasing competition.
vi.       The financial forecasts through fiscal 1984 indicate that the
airport should be able to generate a net inflow of funds of over KE 10
million to the Government Treasury after completion of the project in
fiscal 1976. The annual rate of return on its net fixed assets will rise
from about 9% in fiscal 1976 to 13% in fiscal 1980 and 18% in fiscal 1984,
which is considered satisfactory.
vii.      The project will result in time savings to aircraft and passengers
through more efficient Afrcraft ground handling and shorter passenger pro-
cessing time which reduce operating costs of aircraft and avoid the poten-
tial loss of visitors to Kenya. The economic return to Kenya is estimated
at 15%.
viii.     The project is suitable for a loan to the Republic of Kenya in the
amount of US$29,000,000 for a term of 20 years including a five year grace
period.



KENYA
APPRAISAL OF THE NAIROBI AIRPORT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Kenya approached the Bank in early 1969 to
assist in financing the development of Nairobi Airport. The project which
has emerged after two years of Bank involvement (See Annex 1) is estimated
to cost KE 16.5 million (US$46.3 million equivalent), of which the Bank is
requested to finance the foreign exchange component of 63% amounting to
KL 10.4 million (US$29.0 million).
1.02      The loan would be made to the Republic of Kenya.  The project
would be administered by the Department of Aerodromes, located within the
Ministry of Power and Communications.
1.03      In 1967, the Government retained the consulting firms of Sir
Alexander Gibb and Partners (Africa) and Gibb, Petermuller and Partners -
Ai:hens to prepare a feasibility study for the expansion of the airport.
The consultants presented their final report in June 1971.
1.04      The capacities of the present terminal, apron and taxiway at
Nairobi Airport will be at their saturation points by 1975. The proposed
project which will relieve this congestion consists of the construction of
a new terminal building and all ancillary landside and airside facilities.
The project will be completed in 1975 and will provide initial capacity
sufficient to meet needs up to 1982. The new facilities will provide more
efficient service and faster turnaround times for aircraft, and faster and
more comfortable service for travelers. The benefits of the project will
directly accrue to the Kenyan economy by allowing the unrestrained growth
of tourism, maintaining and improving Nairobi's position as a major inter-
national airport and reducing the costs of Kenya's own air services.
1.05      The project is the first phase of a master plan of airport de-
velopment for Nairobi which provides for integrated future expansion of
terminal building and runway capacity when required. The second phase,
involving extension of the first phase terminal building, apron and other
facilities is planned for completion in 1982 with capacity sufficient
to meet demands until 1988. Further expansion will involve additional
terminal buildings and ultimately a second runway to the southeast of the
present runway.
1.06      Previous Bank/IDA lending for the transportation sector has in-
volved two loans and six credits to Kenya totalling approximately $87 million
for road projects. In addition, Kenya has also been a beneficiary of four
loans totalling $139 million made to the common service organizations of the
last African Community for the development of railways and ports.

1.07      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission
which visited Kenya in August 1971. The appraisal team consisted of Messrs.
W.B.R. Zetterstrom (aviation engineer and mission chief), B. Bostrom (econ-
omist), P.O. Cheryan (financial analyst), D.D. Singh (economist) and P.R.
Nichols (financial analyst) all of whom contributed to the writing of this
report.
2. BACKGROUND
A.   General
2.01      The Republic of Kenya, covering an area of 585,000 sq km, is
bounded on the south by Tanzania, on the west by Lake Victoria and Uganda,
on the north by Sudan and Ethiopia and on the east by Somalia and the
Indian Ocean. It lies a& tie equator but variations in elevation provide
a wide range of climatic conditions. More than half of the country, in
the north and east, is arid and sparsely populated. About three quarters
of Kenya's population of fl million live along the coast and in the high-
lands in the southwest between Mount Kenya and Lake Victoria and are ade-
quately served by surface transportation modes (road and rail). The wide
scattering of game reserves and lodges outside of this area has stimulated
the growth of light aircraft charter traffic.
B.   Tourism
2.02      One of the largest single sources of foreign exchange for Kenya is
tourism which brought in about 12% of all earnings from exports of goods and
services in 1970. The 1970-74 Development Plan estimates that this proportion
will rise to 19% by 1974. Such a growth rate is considered reasonable in view
of the multiple tourist attractions in Kenya.  The implied increase in traffic
will require large investments in tourism and transport infrastructure, of
which the expansion of Nairobi Airport will be an important component. Invest-
ment in hotels and game lodges has recently increased and is expected to
continue creating employment initially in construction and later in the hotel
and tourist serving industries.
C.   The Transportation Sector
2.03      Rail, air and road transport facilities in Kenya are concentrated
along the 965 km corridor from the Uganda border to the Indian Ocean port
of Mombasa which is the principal outlet to the sea for Uganda and Kenya,
as well as for Rwanda and the northeastern part of Zaire.
2.04      The roadway system in Kenya consists of about 40,230 km of trunk,
primary, secondary and minor roads and about 8,850 km of unclassified roads,
of which a total of only 2,410 km are paved. Road transport, including both
freight and passengers, accounted for 29% of Kenya's total revenues from



- 3 -
sales of transport services in 1970. About KE 41.5 million (US$116.2 mil-
lion) was spent by the central government on roads in 1959-68 and a further
expenditure of KE 43 million (US$120.4 million) is anticipated in the 1970-
74 Development Plan. This rate of expenditure is reasonable and may be ex-
pected to continue.
2.05      There are three East African Community (EAC) corporations; Rail-
ways (EARC), Harbors (EAHC) and Airways (EAA). The main railway line
through Kenya, together with the subsidiary lines feeding into it, accounts
for about 1,610 km of the 5,950 km system of EARC. Rail transport contri-
buted about 26% of the total value of sales of transport services in 1970.
Development expenditures of KE 21 million (US$58.8 million) are planned for
railways during the current Plan period. As the principal seaport under
the EAHC, Mombasa accommodates about 1,100 ocean going vessels each year
and accounted for 25% of total transport sales revenues in 1970. The
Development Plan allocates KE 11.6 million (US$32.5 million) for further
development of this sector up to 1974.
2.06      A study of the economic coordination of transport within the
community was carried out in 1969. It focused upon transport policies
which would promote the economic distribution of traffic among modes,
particularly between rail and road. These recommendations are now being
implemented in accordance with a time-phased program under the Third East
African Railway Project (Loan 674-EA).
2.07      East African Airways (EAM), which was formed in 1946, provides
services over a network of 86,900 route kms, of which 14% are domestic
routes within the three EAC countries. In addition to its domestic and
regional services to 29 points in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, the airline
provides international services to eight other countries in Africa and to
Hong Kong, Thailand, India, West Pakistan, Southern Yemen, Greece, Italy,
Switzerland, France, Germany, Denmark and the UK. In 1969 with a fleet
of eight jet, four turbo-prop and ten piston aircraft, the airline carried
294,000 passengers on domestic and EAC services and 157,000 passengers on
international services.
2.08      In addition to EAA and international charter operators, some 22
foreign airlines provide scheduled international services to Kenya. A
total of 20 foreign centers are linked directly to Nairobi by air. The
largest of these in terms of frequency of service are Johannesburg, Rome
and Addis Ababa. The heaviest travelled routes are those connecting
Nairobi to Johannesburg, Rome, Athens, Zurich and Addis Ababa.
2.09      Air transport was responsible for 20% of Kenya's total revenues
from sales of transport services in 1970. The majority of all passenger
departures from the country are made by air transport, including local
residents going to other East African countries. As an essential element



in facilitating tourism and business travel to and from Europe, Asia and
North America, for which there are no practical alternative means of trans-
portation, air transport plays a key role in Kenya's development.
2.10      Kenya has five main commercial airports.  Two of these, Nairobi
and Wilson Airports (see Map 1), are located in Nairobi; the others are in
Mombasa, Malindi and Kisumu. All of these airports receive scheduled ser-
vice except Wilson which is the hub of the general aviation charter busi-
ness. Naircbi and Mombasa Airports are the only airports authorized for
scheduled international service from points outside the East African Com-
munity and, to date, all such services have been operated only to Nairobi.
2.11      The Development Plan provides for a total expenditure of KE 13.7
million (US$38.4 million) on air transport in the five-year period 1969/70 -
1973/74. Of this KE 6.3 million (US$17.6 million) will be invested in EAA,
primarily for purchase of new aircraft and modifications to existing air-
craft. The remaining KE 74 million (US$20.7 million) is allocated for air--
ports. The latest estimates are that actual expenditures on airports will
rise substantially above the Plan target, possibly as high as KE 15 million
(US$42 million). Approximately KE 10.8 million (US$30.2 million) of this
is expected to be incurred for the Nairobi Airport project during this Plan
period. In addition to the Nairobi Airport project, the Government is plan-
ning to expand the capacity of Mombasa Airport. The terminal building at
this airport is inadequate for present passenger traffic and the runway is
too short to handle DC-8 or Boeing 707 aircraft on direct flights to Europe.
3. NAIROBI AIRPORT
A.   Existing Airport
3.01      The present airport was opened to traffic in 1958 and is now the
third busiest international airport in Africa, after Cairo and Johannesburg.
In 1970 it handled 876,000 passengers of which 464,000 were international
non-transit passengers and 184,000 were domestic or internal East African
Community passengers. In terms of international non-transit passenger
traffic, Nairobi compares to airports such as Shannon and Rotterdam. Total
aircraft movements at the airport in 1970 were 38,000 of which 21,500 were
commercial air transport movements.
3.02      The Nairobi Airport is located approximately five miles southeast
of the center of the city. The existing 4,200 m runway was built in stages
and is in very good condition. It has a magnetic alignment of 06/24 and
wind conditions are such that 95% of the total operations are on the 06
heading.



3.03      Approaches to the airport in either direction are good.  There
is an ILS (Instrument Landing System) operating on Runway 06, and VASIS
(Visual Approach Slope Indicator System) are installed at both ends of the
runway. A parallel taxiway system extends from the 06 threshold to the
passenger terminal apron located approximately halfway down the runway on
the city side. There is a turning loop at the three-quarter point of the
runway and a turning circle at the 24 end. Low intensity runway lights and
approach lights exist.
3.04      The terminal building has been expanded to its practical limit
and is expected to be saturated with traffic by 1975. This is true also
of the terminal building apron. An additional constraint to traffic is
the lack of a taxiway link between the terminal apron and the turning
circle which often causes aircraft delays because of conflicts between
arriving or departing traffic and runway traffic.
B.   Master Plan (See Map 2)
3.05      With increasing delays being experienced, the Government's Con-
sultants developed forecasts of anticipated traffic over the next ten to
twenty years and established a phased master plan for airport development
staged in economically sound construction increments.
3.06      In the evolution of the Master Plan in which the Bank has assisted
since 1969, it was determined that the existing terminal area would have to
be abandoned to permit the proper long range development of the airport be-
cause of the forecast requirement for a parallel runway to meet future traffic
demands. This conclusion was dictated by the operational requirement of
placing the new terminal area between the future parallel runways. It require.
the construction of a new parallel taxiway, a new airport access road, a new
freight facility, a new control tower, and all of their support facilities.
If the necessary development were to take place in the existing terminal area,
the future parallel runway would have to be constructed on the city side of
the terminal area. This would force the relocation of Embakasi Village (the
home of 90% of airport employees), would force the relocation of Wilson Airport
(the heaviest used general aviation airport in Africa), possibly would force
the relocation of Eastleigh Airport (the military airport), would cause dis-
turbance of game in the National Game Park and would increase noise on the out-
skirts of the city of Nairobi (see Annex 1 for additional details). In addi-
tion to these substantial revisions in the physical Master Plan, the Bank's 4--
volvement in the preparation of the Master Plan resulted in a major rephasin'
of the investment program, including the postponement by three years of the
construction of a new terminal building.
C.   Existing Organization
3.07      At present, no one single organization is fully responsible for
the management of Kenyan airports. This is especially noticeable at Nairobi
Airport. Excluding entry and exit formalities, the functions at Nairobi are



- 6 -
divided chiefly among (i) The Ministry of Power and Comnunications -- respon-
sibile for general administration and safety; (ii) The Ministry of Works --
responsible for construction and maintenance of aircraft operating areas and
terminal building; and (iii) The East African Community -- charged with op-
erating the air traffic control and and navaids systems (see Chart 1 for
details).  This division of responsibility and the accompanying lack of co-
ordination, particularly between operations and maintenance, have resulted in
operational inefficiencies, inadequate maintenance and poor levels of service.
Under present conditions, a total operational and financial review of the
airport's activities is difficult to accomplish since it involves piecing
together often incomplete information from many sources. Vital planning in-
formation such as operating results, funds flow, value of investments, etc.,
is simply not available on a current and consistent basis.
3.08      Each Ministry having responsibilities at the airport performs
its own administrative and accounting functions on the basis of its own es-
timates of annual expenses as approved by the National Assembly. Landing
fees, parking fees, passenger departure taxes and ground rent collections go
directly to the Government Treasury Department. All other airport revenues,
such as ground handling charges, concessions and building rents are netted
against the operating expenditures of the Ministry concerned.
3.09      Effective technical planning and operating standards are non-existent.
The accounting system follows the governmental practice of recording only cash
receipts and disbursements. It does not incorporate accounting of accruals
and provisions. Financial management and controls are therefore weak, and
the accounting staff is inadequately trained.
D.   Proposed Organization
3.10      To overcome existing deficiencies, the Government has established,
an Aerodromes Department (the Department) within the Ministry of Power -and
Communications to concentrate all the Government's efforts regardino airports
in one office.  The Department will be managed by a Director who wil1 report
directly to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry and will have three
division chiefs reporting to the Director: (i) Deputy Director (Ad.ninistration)
in charge of Operations and Safety, (ii) Chief Aerodromes Engineer in charge
of Engineering and Maintenance and (iii) Financial Manager in charge of
Financial Management (see Chart 2 for details). Firm plans for the staffing
at lower levels and their pay scales will be developed by the Director and
his three Division Chiefs in consultation with the Bank. The staffing plan
will be finalized by 1973 and implemented in accordance with an agreed time-
table. Agreement on these points was obtained during negotiations. In
addition, during negotiations the Government provided assurances that the
Department would be adequately staffed and that the final selection of candi-
dates for the four top positions in the new Department; namely Director39 Chief
of the Operations and Safety Division; Chief Aerodromes Engineer and Financial
Manager would be made in consultation with the Bank by September 1, 1972. The
Chief Aerodromes Engineer has been selected and has reported for duty in
Nairobi. The Financial Manager has also been selected and is expected to take
up his position in Nairobi by the end of July 1972.



3.11      One of the major tasks of the Department will be to establish a
unified conmercial accounting system, to introduce cost accounting methods
and put them in operation. A firm of accounting consultants will be hired
to assist in establishing a new system and to train accounting staff.
Agreement on the appointment of accounting consultants acceptable to the
Bank upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank and the establishment
of this system by July 1, 1973 was reached during negotiations.
3.12      As the Department begins to operate, the need for training will
become more evident in all aspects of airport financial management and air-
port engineering, maintenance and operation at various staff levels. Agree-
ment on the general nature of the training program and the timetable for
its implementation including the selection and training of counterparts
for the senior positions of Financial Manager and Chief Aerodromes Engineer,
was reached during negotiations. It was further agreed that a comprehensive
training plan would be prepared by December 31, 1972.
3.13      With the introduction of commercial and cost accounting systems, an
independent audit will be required as from July 1972. It was agreed during
negotiations that the Controller and Auditor General of Kenya would perform
this audit and that a copy of the audited financial statements would be pro-
vided to the Bank no later than five months after the end of each fiscal
year.
E.   Present Airport Traffic
3.14      During the past ten years the average annual growth in passenger
traffic has been over 13%, accelerating to 14-1/2% in the past five years.
Aircraft movements have increased at an annual average rate of 7% over the
last five years.
3.15      The majority of the 876,000 passengers in 1970 were traveling on
international scheduled services beyond the three East African countries.
They consist of 320,000 arrivals, 328,000 departures and 228,000 passengers
in transit. There is a seasonal variation with higher traffic levels in the
first and third quarters of the year. In August 1970 the number of pas-
sengers was some 15% higher than the annual monthly average and in May 1970,
14% lower. This is typical of the variations over the past five-year period.
Of the 38,000 total aircraft movements in 1970, 12,000 were international
scheduled services, 7,800 were internal services to East Africa and the rest
local, military, test or training flights. The test and training activity
for that year was abnormally large because of the introduction of new air-
craft types by East African Airways.
F.   Traffic Forecasts
3.16      Forecasts of passenger, cargo and aircraft traffic were prepared
by the Consultant based on past air traffic trends, the Government Develop-
ment Plan (1970-74) and forecasts prepared by some international air car-



- 8 -
riers and international organizations. These forecasts have been adjusted
to reflect recent developments; they cover a period from 1970 to 1985 and
are considered reasonable.
a.   Passenger Forecast
3.17      For projection purposes the passengers were divided into five
categories, with different past growth characteristics. The numbers of
foreign tourists and businessmen have grown at a yearly rate between 18
and 22% over the last ten years while the numbers of local residents
traveling outside of East Africa have increased at a yearly average of
only 2% over the same period.  Traffic within East Africa, on the other
hand, grew at a yearly average of 13% for the first part of the decade
but recently this growth rate has diminished considerably. Transit traf-
fic has been growing at a relatively constant yearly rate of 11%. These
rates will be slightly lower for the next ten years. Tourist traffic is
expected to grow at up to 15% per year, foreign business traffic at 13%,
local resident traffic at about 3%, transit traffic at 9%, while traffic
within East Africa will probably grow at 5%. For the second 10-year
period, because of the uncertainty of such long-term forecasts, an 11.5%
growth rate for the combined categories and 5% for traffic within East
Africa has been assumed. The detailed development of forecast growth
rates for each category is given in Annex 2.
b.   Cargo Forecast
3.18      The air cargo forecasts are based on the growth tendencies of
different commodity groups and their probable use of air traiwportation.
The most important of these are some types of agricultural products, in
particular horticultural exports which are expected to grow very rapidly.
Studies of general tendencies in air cargo growth worldwide and in Africa
lhave also been considered.  The rate of growth has been an overall 16% an-
nual average in most recent years while that used for the forecast is 9%
to 17% per year for inbound cargo and 13.5% to 17% per year for outbound
cargo.  The yearly rate for mail was an average of 9.5% during 1966 to 1970
and is expected to be about 7.5% per year up to 1975 and 6% thereafter.
c.   Aircraft Movements
3.19      The commercial aircraft movement forecast is based upon the pas-
senger forecasts, projections as to the seat load factors expected and
projections as to likely aircraft mixes in the future. Forecasts of test
and training, military, freight and other movements are based upon past
trends. The aircraft movements had an average annual increase of 7.5%
between 1966 and 1970. It is expected that they will increase at 1% an-
nually to 1975 and 3% to 3.5% thereafter. The introduction of larger air-
craft and fewer test and training flights are the main reason for these
lower growth rates.

4. THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
4.01      The proposed project will be the first stage development of an
airport Master Plan dictated by the environment (see para. 3.06) and the
need to protect existing resources and future development areas. (See Annex

I)      lo t ol plalllwltd I iiVesinLent iIr tthe Nairobi Airport [or thie period 1971-
1984 IIOUI1ti Lo KE 22.8 iiiillioui (US$64.0 million).  'rue proposed project will
constitute the first five years of the program. Details of the program are
given in Table 1. Investment in all other Kenyan airports during this five
year period will be KE 7.0 million (US$ 19.6 million).
A.   Description of the Project
4.02      The project consists of the construction of a new international
and domestic terminal building (See Maps 3 and 4), freight building, asso-
ciated aprons, taxiways, roads, car parks, main parallel taxiway, holding
apron, maintenance apron, combined control tower/area control center, State
Pavilion, police station, fire station, other ancillary buildings, airfield
and roadway lighting, approach lighting, fire hydrant system, water, elec-
trical and sewage systems, freight access road, a dual carriageway pas-
senger access road, and the provision of technical services and training.
B.   Special Implications of the Project
a.   Airport Access Road
4.03      A dual carriageway will be provided from its connection with the
Nairobi/Mombasa highway to the terminal building. An assurance was obtained
from the Government during negotiations that the intersection of the Nairobi/
Mombasa road and the airport access road will be constructed by December 31,
1975 and that the Nairobi/Mombasa road between London Road roundabout and the
intersection will be constructed by December 31, 1976 both as dual carriageways
and on alignments and with geometries approved by the Bank.
b.   Water Supply
4.04      An expansion of the Nairobi water system has been planned.  The
first stage of this system is being constructed under a Bank financed proj-
ect (714-KE). The connecting link to the airport was planned to be con-
structed in 1976. An assurance was obtained from the Government during
negotiations that the construction of this link will be rephased so that it
will be ready for the terminal building opening at the end of 1975.
c.   Fueling System
4.05      A consortium of fuel companies will lease land from the airport
to construct a fuel farm and underground hydrant systen to provide jet
fuel to the terminal and freight aprons. Gasoline deliveries will be made
by apron tank trucks.



- 11 -
d.   Ecology
4.06      The ecological and environmental effects of the development of the
airport were major factors influencing the decision to develop the new termi-
nal area on the far side of the existing runway, since such development would
tend to remove aircraft noise and exhaust gases further away from the city of
Nairobi. The airport sewerage system will be connected to the city system
partly to remove possible sources of odors and insect breeding grounds from
within the airport boundaries and partly to avoid the introduction of the ef-
fluent from the airport system into a normally dry stream bed. The effect of
the airport on the animals in the National Game Park was investigated and
found to be very small, since little drinking water is located in the area
near the airport and, therefore, relatively few animals are involved. In
the future, when the parallel runway is constructed, the effect will be
further reduced because the center of potentially disturbing factors will
move further away from the major concentration of game.
e.   Technical Personnel
4.07      The new Aerodromes Department (see para. 3.10) will require tech-
nical assistance in the form of two aviation experts in executive positions.
1he first year's financing for these positions has been provided by UNDP.
However, to safeguard against the possibility that the Government might be
unsuccessful in continuing to obtain financing for these positions through
either the UNDP or bilateral aid, the project includes a sum for the salary,
benefits, and support for these two men for four years. Funds to cover the
cost of hiring the accountant consultant as well as the cost of the training
recommended in paras. 3.11 and 3.12 are included in the project estimates.
C.   Design and Supervision
4.08      The Government consultants, Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners
(Africa) and Gibb, Petermuller and Partners are preparing the architectural
and engineering final design plans and specifications. This work is well
advanced and will be substantially completed by the time the loan is signed.
The consultants are competent and the quality of their work is good. There
will be a requirement for contract management and construction supervision
through mid-1976. The present project architects and engineers have been
engaged by the Government for this purpose and the costs of this service
have been included in the project.
D.   Cost Estimate
4.09      It is estimated that the total cost of the project would be K£ 16.5
million (US$46.3 million equivalent) of which KE 10.4 million (US$29.0 mil-
lion) would be the foreign exchange component forming the basis for the pro-
posed loan.

packages as proposed by the Consultant. A detailed itemization of these

4.11      The cost estimates were developed by the engineering consultants
based on civil and architectural work recently awarded in Kenya and are con-
sidered reasonable. Land required for this project is already owned by the
Government.
4.12      An item for price contingencies, based on recent historical data,
amounting to 7% per year for the civil construction contracts and 10% per
year for the architectural construction contracts for a total of 14% of the
total project construction costs (excluding physical contingencies) over the
construction period has been included to allow for anticipated increases in
labor and material costs. Since engineering is almost complete, only an ad-
ditional 5% of the total construction costs has been included to allow for
changes in design and scope of work.



- 13 -
E.   Construction Employment
4.13      It is estimated that during the construction phases of the project,
on the average approximately 500 men, ranging from common laborers to high-
ly skilled artisans will be employed. The greater proportion of these will
be engaged in the construction of the terminal, freight, etc. building por-
tions of the project because of the labor intensive character of building
construction.
F.   Procurement
4.14      The five contracts in which the project is divided will be awarded
through international competitive bidding procedures following the Bank's
"Guidelines for Procurement" after contractor prequalification.  Local con-
tractors are generally not financially able to engage in projects over KE
1,000,000. Since only two of the contracts are expected to fall in this
price range and both of these are procurement contracts for foreign made
material, it is unlikely that local contractors will win the award for any
of the contracts. It is possible, however, that a number of sub-contracts
would be carried out by local contractors. The estimated foreign exchange
component is based on this premise. The bidding processes under the procure-
ment arrangements are not affected by preferential import duties.
G.   Disbursement
4.15      Disbursement of the proposed loan would be made on the basis of:
(a) 100% of Contract No. 1
(b) 90% of Contract No. 2
(c) 60% of Contract Nos. 3 through 5
(d) 70% of the architectural and engineering consultant's fee
(e) 60% of the costs for the financial manager, airport engineer,
accounting consultant and training
These percentages are estimated to represent the foreign exchange components
of the various items.
4.16      Disbursements are expected to take place over a 5-year period from
the second quarter of 1972 to the fourth quarter of 1976. A schedule of the
disbursed quarterly payments of the proposed loan is shown in Table 2. Since
this is a self-contained project, any surplus loan amounts should be cancel-
led.
4.17      The cost estimate includes US$4,095,000 for the estimated archi-
tectural and engineering cost of the project. It is recommended that the
foreign component of the part of these services carried out prior to sign-
ing of the loan, i.e., from April 1, 1970, should be financed retroactively
from the proposed loan. It is estimated that this would amount to approxi-
mately US$1,350,000 or 70% of US$1,930,000 equivalent.

5. Economic Evaluation
A.   General
5.01      The existing functional areas at Nairobi Airport, both in the
airfield and terminal systems, are undersized for the growing demands that
are being placed upon them and hence are rapidly becoming congested. The
project is designed to expand the capacity of the airport so that it may ac-
commodate the substantial growth in demand that is predicted. The project's
most important impact on Kenyan economic development is in helping the growth
of Tourism, which is one of the country's principal sources of foreign ex-
change and which plays a large and rapidly growing role in the domestic prod-
uct of Kenya. The project will also help Nairobi to maintain its position as
an important commercial centre with good communications. Finally it will en-
courage the growth of certain types of agricultural exports, for example,
horticultural products wIhdwhE rely heavily on air transport. These exports,
although comparatively smais in relation to Kenya's total foreign trade, are
expected to grow rapidly in the future.
5.02      These consequencm, of the project occur because increasing the
capacity of the airport situitaneoulsy removes two related but separate
sources of delay which act upon each other.  First, the existing terminal
building is inadequate for the projected growth in traffic. Its use would
not only cause increasing delays to the passengers within it, but to the
ground operations of aircraft and would thus generate further delays to
passengers. Second, the ground facilities for aircraft are inadequate for
the anticipated growth of aircraft movements. The project will directly re-
duce delays to aircraft by providing more apron space an4F taxiing: facilities.
The new full length taxiway will avoid the need to use the runway itself for
taxiing which causes delays;.: it will also reduce the actual taxiIng distances
for large aircraft.
5.03      The congestion at Nairobi airport does not occur at all times but
is concentrated in certain specific peak periods of high demand. Before
measuring the benefits of the project, the scope for spreading these peaks
was examined. The peak pattern of demand at-Nairobi is determined by such
factors as restrictions at European airports, particularly the night flying
restrictions at London, and by the fact that Nairobi is an intermediate
point on the South African - European air routes; there is therefore very
little flexibility in the peaking pattern. Moreover, the peak periods at
Nairobi are made up almost exclusively of international scheduled air pas-
senger services. These services necessarily have route patterns which
are determined by a complex set of factors, including fleet-^utilization con-
siderations, and are therefore only partly determined by the cost and pricing
conditions at each point they serve. Thus, despite an existing 50% night
surcharge on landing fees at Nairobi, one of the two major peak periods at
present occurs late at night. The effective scope for peak spreading, without
incurring substantial traffic losses, by the use of differential pricing is
therefore extremely limited, and any effects of a differential pricing policy
on the peak pattern is likely to be insignificant.



- 15 -
5.04      Three types of benefit have been directly evaluated and taken into
account in calculating the return of the investment: benefits to Kenya
arising from the direct expenditure of visitors who would otherwise not visit
Kenya (about 42% of the total benefits in 1985), savings in the operating
costs of Kenyan aircraft (about 15%), and increased airport revenues gen-
erated by the project (about 43%). Benefits from increased freight traffic
were not evaluated, because of their relative unimportance.
B.   Effects on Passenger Traffic
5.05      If the project is not carried out the congestion at Nairobi will
soon reach such levels that the growth of demand for journeys, particularly
by tourists, to Kenya will be retarded. This will happen because tourism
is a highly competitive industry. Tourists themselves would seek to avoid
congested conditions, but perhaps a more important consideration is that the
long and unforeseen delays that congestion produces have very serious conse-
quences on the profitability and pricing of tour operators, who increasingly
control the flow of tourists. In addition, airport congestion has serious
effects on the cost of airline operations. The congestion at Nairobi, if
the project were not implemented, would not only mean that the airport would
be incapable of accommodating all the aircraft, particularly large aircraft,
that would wish to use it, it would also give rise to substantial increases
in the costs of aircraft operations. These factors, given the processes of
international air fare determination, are more likely to adversely affect
the frequency and quality of service of foreign airlines serving Nairobi
rather than the price of air travel to Nairobi. In either case, a dampening
of passenger demand would result.
5.06      The volume of passenger traffic arriving at Nairobi that would be
suppressed if the project were not carried out has been estimated at about
10,000 passengers per annum by 1980, rising to over 40,000 by 1985. Details
of the methods used in arriving at these estimates are given in Annex 4.
5.07      The impact on the Kenyan economy of such losses of foreign visitors
arriving at Nairobi has been assessed conservatively. It has been assumed
that half of these passengers would travel to Kenya by other routes or modes,
e.g. via Tanzania or Uganda, and that the durations of their stays and their
expenditures in Kenya would not be affected by this diversion. An estimate
was made of the direct net contribution to Kenya's GNP of an average foreign
visitor's stay in the country.  The direct gross expenditure per tourist fo
the average length of stay in Kenya was derived from the Nairobi Airport
Tourist Survey and from the Kenya Development Plan. This gross figure, after
price level adjustments, was reduced by an estimate of its import content
and by an estimate of the local resource costs involved in the average
tourist expenditure. The resulting nec contribution to GNP per visitor per
visit was assessed to be Kb80 rising to KblOO by 1985. Applying this unit
contribution to half of the tourists lost at Nairobi Airport results in pro-
ject benefits which reach a level of over KE2 million per annum by 1985.



- 16 -
C.   Aircraft Operating Cost Savings
5.08      Aircraft operating on the ground and in the air will save time as
a result of the new taxiway, the new terminal aprons and the more efficient
operations in the new terminal buildings. The operating time of aircraft
in the with-project situation was compared by simulation models to the without-
project situation, making allowances for the traffic which would be supressed
if the project was not undertaken. The hourly costs for different aircraft
types were obtained from published sources and allowances were made for the
growth of these costs until 1985 arising from the gradual introduction of
larger and more expensive aircraft. Although these delay costs would be in-
curred by all the airlines Lsing the airport, the project has only been
credited with the aircraft operating cost savings which directly accrue to
Kenya. Since Kenya does not independently run a major airline but shares
equally in the ownership of East African Airways with Tanzania and Uganda,
it has been assumed that 1/3 of the cost savings to E.A.A. aircraft would
accrue to the Kenyan econoy. These savings to Kenya amount to over
KI700,000 per annum by 1985. The project would also produce substantial
additional aircraft operating cost savings (over five times as great as
those that accrue directly to Kenya) which would in the first instance
benefit foreign aircraft operators. These savings have been estimated
but have not been credited to the project in the rate of return calculation.
D.   Project Induced Incremental Airport Revenues
5.09      The project will also provide direct benefits to the Kenyan economy
in the form of additional revenue at the airport which would be lost if the
project was not implemented. Firstly, the project by allowing the airport
to accommodate not only more but larger aircraft would enable it to earn
additional landing fee revenue from foreign airlines. The difference in
such revenues that would be obtained under the with and without project
situations were estimated and credited to the project.
5.10      Secondly, the provision of the new terminal building will signifi-
cantly reduce the processing time of passengers and will in aggregate save
a very substantial amount of passenger time. A large proportion of these
time savings would accrue to foreign passengers and thus may not directly
benefit the Kenyan economy. It has been agreed with the Kenyan Government
that a study of user charges at Nairobi airport would be undertaken to de-
velop new rates which would take effect when the new airport facilities were
available. In the absence of the results of this study, it has been assumed,
in line with the financial projections made in Chapter 6 of this report,
that an additional passenger charge equivalent to 5K. sh. per departing
passenger would be levied at the airport upon completion of the new terminal
building.  The incremental revenue generated by this charge, which amounts
to only a part of the value of the time savings to the 'normal traffic' pas-
sengers (valued on the basis of the principles outlined in Annex 2 of the
paper "Bank Lending for Aviation Projects" - R72-88), would be available
directly to Kenya as a result of the project and has therefore been treated
as an economic benefit of the project.



- 17 -
5.11      Thirdly, the project will generate incremental revenues in the
form of additional rentals (net of increased operating costs) for the in-
creased terminal space provided to airlines. This net incremental revenue
has been credited to the project.
5.12      The incremental airport revenue that the project generates in the
three ways described above amounts to over KTh2.1 million per annum by 1985.
E.   Project Return
5.13      The estimated capital costs of the project at 1971 prices have
been used in calculating the economic rate of return on the project. In
addition the costs of the second phase (see para. 1.05), which is due for
completion in 1982 and will provide sufficient capacity to meet demands
until 1988, have been treated as economic costs of the project in calculating
the project return. Since additional investment is expected to be necessary
to process the growth of traffic at the airport beyond 1988, the project
benefits have been assumed to increase only until 1988 and to maintain a
constant level over the remainder of the project period. On the basis of
these costs and the benefits described above, the economic return of the
project over the life of the investment is 15%. It should be noted that this
calculation only takes into account those benefits that accrue directly to
the Kenyan economy. If the savings on "normal traffic" to passengers and to
foreign aircraft which have not been subjected to charges are also taken
into account the rate of return would be substantially higher.
5.14      An assessment of the optimum timing for the implementation of the
project was made by means of first year return analysis. The first year
return resulting from the completion of the project as proposed compared to
completing it one year later is slightlv higher than the 10% assumed appor-
tunity cost of capital.
5.15      The sensitivity of the rate of return to possible variations in
costs and benefits has been tested with the following results. A 15% in-
crease in the estimated construction cost of the project and delaying all
benefits by one year, would reduce the economic return from 15% to about 12%.
If all benefits were decreased by 25%, either by a 25% lower traffic forecast
or by a 25% reduction in the unit benefits, the economic return would be over
12%. If the valve of benefits were increased by 25%, the economic return
would be 17.5%.
6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Existing Situation
6.01      In spite of the existing organizational and accounting shortcomings
(see paras. 3.08 and 3.09), it has been possible to assemble pertinent his-
torical financial data on Nairobi Airport for fiscal 1969 through 1971, in-
cluding items presently unaccounted for such as depreciation, pension bene-



-. 18 -
fits, etc., and the values of existing fixed assets. Estimated past operat-
ing results shoqn in Table 3, havre been satisfactory and the airport has
been a dependable source of revenues for the Government.
B.   Financial Objectives
6.02      The proposed Department will be responsible for developing and
recommending airport user charges to the Government, and for accounting of
all investment, revenues and expenditures under its own separate annual capi-
tal and operating budgets. Although all cash generated by the airport will
go into the National Treasury and the expenditures met from budget allocations,
it is the Government's intention to set up a commercial accounting system for
the Department reflecting, on an accrual basis, all transactions relating to
the investment in and operation of airports, and in particular of Nairobi
Airport, including operating revenues and expenses, current assets, fixed
assets, and related depreciation, current liabilities, long-term debt and
capital (Government inves.tint and surpluses appropriated and retained).
Agreement on the establishment of this system by July 1, 1973 was obtained
during negotiations.
6.03      The existing user charges are given in Annex 5.  They are not
related to costs and are heavily weighted against the aircraft maneuvering
areas in favor of the passenger and freight handling areas (terminals). In
order to maintain the airport's competitive position, cost controls and user
charges related to costs must be developed by identifying the cost/profit
centers and instituting appropriate allocation procedures. The Department
and its new Financial Manager and accounting consultants (see paras. 3.10
and 3.11) will study the question of user charges at Nairobi Airport and in
consultation with the Bank will develop rater related to costs to be in ef-
fect for the opening of the new terminal. Such rates should produce suffi-
cient net operating income to ensure agreed minimum rates of return. It was
agreed during negotiations that a scale of user charges would be prepared by
December 31, 1974, that the Bank would review this scale of charges by June 30,
1975 and that the new charges would be implemented before the new facilities
were opened for operation.
C.   Financing Plan
6.04      The summary given below shows the funds required and their sources
during the 5 year construction period covered by fiscal years 1972 through
1977.

6.05      The Government's contribution is shown in the proforma balance
sheets as equity (invested capital). To ensure that the execution of the
project will not be jeopardized because of shortage of funds, agreement
was reached during negotiations that the Government will make all neces-
sary funds available, and will finance all project cost overruns.
6.06      The projections assume that the proposed Bank loan would bear in-
terest at 7-1/4Z p.a., and would be repayable over 20 years including a
5-year grace period. Details of the financial assumptions are shown in
Annex 6.
D.   Future Earnings and Proforma Financial Position of Nairobi Airport
6.07      Projected operating results through 1984 are shown in Table 3.
Operating revenues are based on the forecast traffic growth and the space
occupany and related rate structure of the new terminal complex. The
critical point is the burden on airlines of the combined effect of land-
ing fees and space user charges in the building. The projections assume



- 20 -
that the landing fee rates will continue as they are and that the space
usage charges will gradually increase in relation to the numbers of pas-
sengers handled. This is considered reasonable (see projected user charges
details in Annex 5).
6.08      Operating expenses, estimated on a global basis and making ample
allowances for cost increases, include an annual outlay of 2% of the in-
vestment in the various operating areas for recurrent repair and preventive
maintenance programs. Agreement was reached during negotiations that the
Department will expend amounts sufficient for this purpose on a current and
continuous basis. Such sums will be shown in the income and expenditure
accounts of the airport.
6.09      The projected cash flow (see Table 4) prepared on a proforma basis
through fiscal 1984, shows that the airport should be able to cover its cash
operating requirements, service its debt, finance a major investment of Kt, 5
million and generate a met inflow of funds of over KE 10 million to the Na-
tional Treasury after completion of the project.
6.10      Proforma balance sheets are given in Table 5.  Except for a small
cash revolving fund (KE 30,000), all cash generated reverts to the Govern-
ment.  After completion of the project, a major investment of approximately
Kf 5 million from internally generated funds will take place in fiscal 1981
and 1982 for the construction of an additional segment to the terminal build-
ing complex.
6.11      The rate of return on net fixed assets reflects satisfactory levels
throughout. During negotiations agreement was obtained from the Government
that the Department will take all necessary measures, including adjustments
in rates, to achieve a rate of return for Nairobi Airport of at least 5%
through the 1977 fiscal year, 8.0% in the 1978 and 1979 fiscal years and 10.0%
thereafter. Since projected revenues are such that, after 1979, the rate of
return would far exceed 10X, care should be taken to keep costs under control.
To assure this, agreement was obtained during negotiations that annual oper-
ating ratios will be maintained as low as possible but at least below 72%
through 1979 and below 60% thereafter. Financial ratios are shown in Table 6.
6.12      The projections were developed by the Bank staff on the basis
of information available and reflect the financial situation of Nairobi Air-
port on a proforma basis. The Government agrees with these projections.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following
principal points:
a.   Appointment of suitably qualified and experienced persons
for the top positions in the Aerodromes Department by
September 1, 1972 (para 3.10).
b.   Implementation of an agreed staffing and training plan for
the Department (paras 3.10 and 3.12).
c.   Hiring of accounting consultants on agreed terms of
reference to assist in establishing by July 1973 a
commercial accounting system for the Department (para 3.11).
d.   Construction of a dual carriageway connecting the airport
to the main highway (para 4.03).
e.   Maintenance by the Department of complete accounting
records to reflect all transactions affecting the air-
port operation under budgetary control and commercial
accounting systems (para 6.02).
f.   Development, in consultation with the Bank, of a cost
related user charges system and its implementation no
later than the opening of the facilities (para 6.03).
g.   Setting aside of adequate funds for recurrent repair and
preventative maintenance programs and the expending of
these funds on a current and continuous basis (para 6.08).
h.   Taking all necessary measures to achieve annual rates
of return for Nairobi Airport of at least 5% through
1977 fiscal year, 8% in 1978 and 1979 fiscal years and
10% thereafter (para 6.11).
i.   Maintenance of annual operating ratios at the lowest
possible levels but of at least below 72% through 1979
fiscal year and below 60% thereafter (para 6.11).
7.02      It is recommended that the foreign exchange cost of design and
engineering services performed before the signing of the loan, i.e. from
April 1, 1970, in an amount not exceeding US$1,350,000 should be financed
retroactively (para 4.17).
7.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$29.0 million for a term of 20 years including a 5-year grace period.

KENYA
NAIROBI AIRPORT PROJECT
The Project
A.   Master Plan
The project that has now evolved after approximately four
years of study is the result of the application of accepted principles
of airport master planning. The existing airport at Nairobi consists of
a single runway on a heading of 06/24, with the terminal building, apron,
freight and maintenance facilities located on the northwest side of the
runway. This is the area that is closest to Nairobi. On a line perpendi-
cular to the runway passing through the terminal building, is the village
"Embakasi," approximately 2,000 meters from the runway. Approximately 90%
of the employees of the airport reside in this village. Almost on the same
perpendicular line but a little more to the north and about four miles from
the airport is the military airport of Eastleigh. Approximately six miles
to the southwest of Eastleigh, lies Wilson Airport and beyond it the high
area called Ngong Hills. Wilson Airport is the busiest general aviation
airport in Africa. Its major activity involves the transporting of tourists
in small aircraft -- four to six passengers -- from Nairobi to game lodges
located in East Africa, each of which has a landing strip nearby.
The center of Nairobi is to the northwest of the main runway at
the international airport ana is approximatelv five miles away. Between
the build-up section of the city and Embakasi village there is a drainage
swale or dry river also named Ngong. To the southwest of Nairobi Airport
is the National Game Park. This park has a fence around the northern
perimeter but is completely open to the south for the free passage of
game. It is a major attraction for tourists in Nairobi.
The consultants' study determined that the existing airport and
its facilities would be saturated by the traffic that was envisioned to
build up by 1975. This saturation would occur at two major points on the
airport. One point was the runway itself because of the lack of a taxiway
between the apron and the turning loop, approximately 3,000 meters from the
approach or 06, end of the runway. With 95% of operations on Runway 06,
aircraft, after landing, have to use the runway as a taxiway which severely
restricts the number of movements possible. Even now (1971) there are some-
times three aircraft held in this loop waiting for additional aircraft to
land or take off. The second point of congestion is the terminal building and
its apron. The existing terminal was originally a hangar and has been added
to repeatedly to try to cope with new traffic demands. In 1970 the latest



ANNEX 1
Page 2
expansion project was undertaken. With its completion the terminal has
reached its ultimate expansion capabilities and, as expanded, can only cope
with the traffic anticipated by 1974/75. The apron adjacent to the terminal
has thirteen positions available for aircraft to park. Even now all positions
are full at times. By 1975, after the introduction this year of two B-747
arrivals within the same hour and in 1973/74 the acquisition by East African
Airways of the first of its two anticipated wide-body transports (possibly
DC-10), the apron will be hopelessly overcrowded and will cause critical
delays.
To overcome these congestions it was decided that the terminal had
to be replaced and the taxiway expanded. The original thought was to build
a new international terminal building and apron adjacent to the existing
terminal and plan for the addition of a second runway, parallel to the first,
northwest of the existing runway, to have the terminal buildings between the
two runways. From an airport point of view this was sensible because a
terminal between two runways can serve either runway without restricting
traffic on the other. However, if the plan as presented were to be followed
there would be several extremely costly adverse affects.
(i) Embakasi village would have to be abandoned and relocated
because the runway would pass directly through it.
(ii) Wilson Airport would have to be closed and rebuilt in
another location because approaches to the future Nairobi
runway would pass within three miles of Wilson Airport
and traffic to Wilson would have to pass over the Ngong
Hills and under the instrument approach to Nairobi, a
very restrictive procedure. Upon investigation the only
site that could be found aeronautically suitable for
development as a general aviation airport was approximately
25 miles south of Nairobi beyond the Athi River plains.
Such location would tend to dampen, if not kill, the growth
of general aviation in this area.
(iii) Eastleigh Airport would similarly have to be closed.
However, in this case, its existence within the boundaries
of the City of Nairobi is questionable and it may ultimately
have to be relocated for other reasons.
(iv) The anticipated growth of the City of Nairobi toward the
airport would be greatly affected by the noise generated
by a runway located approximately 1-1/4 miles closer to
the city.
(v) The centerline of the new runway would fall directly over
the largest concentration of game in the National Game Park
and might possibly have the effect of driving that game
away.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
Because of these conditions it was decided that the existing
terminal area would be abandoned, the building itself would be used as
office space and aviation-oriented use but would no longer serve as a
terminal. The urgently required new terminal would be located on the
far, or southeast side of the existing runway, away from the city center.
The future parallel runway would be built 1-1/4 miles to the southeast of
the existing runway and farther from Nairobi. This location would still
place the terminal building between the two runways but there would be none
of the problems mentioned above. The two airports, Wilson and Eastleigh,
would be less affected than at present because it would be envisioned that
the future parallel runway would, in general, be the landing runway, thus
moving the approach or misapproach paths farther away from Wilson and
Eastleigh. The center of noise would also be further away from the city
center. The development of the city could take place to the Ngong River
as planned with no adverse effects. The urgently required enlargement of
Embakasi village to suit the needs of the airport employees could take
place as planned. By utilizing the future parallel runway as the landing
runway, the effect on the National Game Park would be lessened because the
approach path would be another 1-1/4 miles southeast of the existing path
and, therefore, farther by that amount from the center of gravity of game
concentration.
The effects of this decision on the proposed project were imme-
diate and costly. A new parallel taxiway had to be planned for installation
at the same time as the terminal building or else the capacity constraint on
the runway would not have been improved at all, in fact, would probably
have been reinforced. Since the terminal was being located in an entirely
new area, an access road had to be planned to serve it. The existing access
road could not be used for this purpose. The future location of the aircraft
operating areas and parallel runway dictated the location of the control
tower. The high percentage of freight being carried on passenger aircraft,
so-called "top up" freight, required the location of the freight terminal
to be adjacent to the passenger terminal. This meant that the existing
freight facility as expanded had to be abandoned. In addition to these
major facilities, new utilities for them had to be provided. In all, out
of a project estimated at about KE 16 million close to KE 4 million are in
this type of facility replacement required by the decision to locate the
future parallel runway away from the center of Nairobi. On the other hand,
the decision on the relocation of the terminal has also in effect resulted
in a major rephasing of the investment program and a postponement of the
planned construction date for the new terminal by 3 years.
B.   Description of the Project (First Stage)
a. Terminal Building
A combined international and domestic terminal building will be
constructed on the southeast side of the existing runway. It will consist
of two international departure units, a domestic arrival and departure unit
and one international arrivals unit. The building is designed for power-in
push-out aircraft operations and will ultimately have nine airbridges for



ANNEX 1
Page 4
transfer of passengers between the building and aircraft. In the original
stage only four bridges will be provided. Space has been provided between
the original departure units for the future addition of three more depar-
ture units. The addition of baggage conveyors and Customs inspection
counters within the framework of the first stage arrivals unit would allow
it to function satisfactorily under the increased demands of the future.
b.   Freight Building
A freight shed to provide space to make-up and break-down both
passenger aircraft top-up pallets and freight aircraft containerized ship-
ping units will be provided adjacent to the terminal building. Attached
to this general cargo shed will be a cold storage shed for agricultural,
horticultural, meat and dairy products. The livestock units will be en-
larged slightly but will remain where they are on the northwest side of
the runway.
c.   Control Tower and Area Control Center
A new control tower for airport control will be constructed at a
point nearly equidistant from the ends of the existing and future parallel
runways. Attached to the base of the control tower will be the operational
offices of the area control center. While this function does not necessarily
have to be located on an airport, in this case it will allow better utiliza-
tion of scarce operations and maintenance personnel.
d.  Ancillary Buildings
A new eight bay fire station will be constructed near the terminal
building. This station will double the equipment of the existing facilities
and raise the airport fire protection to that recommended by ICAO for an
airport serving aircraft types and fuel capacities as those at Nairobi.
A Pavilion in which political dignitaries will be greeted with
ceremonies appropriate to their rank will be constructed near the new ter-
minal building. Without this unit the airport would have to be closed for
security purposes during such arrivals or departures.
A new police station will he constructed within the new terminal
building complex. Adjacer,t to it will be facilities for telephone equipment,
water pumping equipment. electrical transformation and standby power genera-
tion equipment. Near the freight complex will be a staff canteen. This
facility will provide low cost lunches for approximately 500 airport employees
per day.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
e.   Aircraft Operating Areas
A new 2500 x 25 m parallel taxiway will be constructed to serve
the existing runway and the new freight and terminal building complex. A
holding apron near the runway threshold will be provided as well as aprons
for the freight building, terminal building, and aircraft maintenance area.
Interconnecting taxiways will be provided as necessary.
f.   A fire hydrant system will be provided for the major building
areas, the freight and terminal building aprons and at the mid-point of the
runway.
g.   Lighting
A new high intensity approach light system will be provided. This
will be controlled by a five step transformer. Only the threshold lights
and inner 170 m of approach lights will be flush mounted. New high intensity
(five step) runway edge lights will be installed along with medium intensity
(three step) taxiway and apron edge lights. Street lighting will be pro-
vided in front of the terminal building, around the parking lot and unload-
liig areas of the freight building and for short distances beyond street
intersections.
h.   Access Roads
A new dual carriageway will be provided from the Nairobi/Mombasa
highway along the spine of the new terminal complex to the terminal. A
single carriageway road from the existing airport access road to the new
freight complex will be provided to serve freight traffic from the new Nairobi
industrial area now under development and also the employee traffic from their
homes in Embakasi Village.
i.   Utilities
Engineering has been completed and a cost included in the estimates
to provide for the necessary expansion of the existing electrical supply
system to accommodate the anticipated requirements of the expanded airport.
The potable water renuirements for the airport have been estimated
and included in the demand forecasts for the present Bank financed water
project. A connecting link from this new main to the airport must be con-
structed earlier than originally planned to assure the airport of receiving
the necessary supply when the new terminal opens in mid-1975. The quantity
of water required during construction could exceed the amount available from
the Nairobi system at that time, but plans are being made to supplement the
potable supply with water from existing boreholes within the construction
area and the lack of water is not experted to be a problem.
It was originally intended to build a nev airport sewage treatment
plant on the airport property consisting of open oxidation ponds. However,



ANNEX 1
Page 6
since the city of Nairobi will have completed a new sewage treatment plant
of sufficient capacity to serve the airport by the time the airport will
require it and since the main trunk for this system will pass close by the
northern boundaries of the airport, it was decided to include a connection
to this main in the project rather than construct a separate sewage disposal
system for the airport. The results of this decision are twofold; first,
the capital costs of the project have been lowered by approximately KE 15,000,
and second, the airport environment will not be subjected to the effects of
a large sewage lagoon in the vicinity. In addition, it was estimated that
by the year 1990 the connection to the city system would be required anyway
because of increased airport population.

NAIROBI AIRPORT PROJECT
Forecasts
A.   Present Airport Traffic
Nairobi Airport is the center of commercial aviation activity in
Kenya as well as in East Africa. During the past ten years the average
annual growth in passengers has been over 13%, accelerating to about 14-1/2%
in the past five years. The growth in aircraft movements has been a 7%
annual average in the past five years. In 1970 there were 876,000 passen-
gers and 38,000 aircraft movements.
B.   Passenger Forecasts
The forecasts for passenger and cargo traffic prepared by the
Consultants have been adjusted to reflect recent developments and cover
a period from 1970 to 1990.
For projection purposes, the passengers were divided into the
following five categories: foreign tourists, foreign businessmen, local
residents, travelers within East Africa and direct transit passengers.
The numbers of holiday visitors have grown at a rate of 20% during the
past 10 years. While economic growth in the major generating countries
and the likelihood of reductions in air fares suggest a strong tendency
for this growth rate to continue well into the future, several factors are
likely to exert some downward pressure on this trend, the most important
of which are expected to be the diversionary effects of the new airport at
Kilimanjaro and the enlarged airport proposed for Mombasa. It has been
estimated that there would be a 5% diversion of traffic to Kilimanjaro in
1972 and that by 1980 both airports would divert a combined total of 20%.
On these bases an annual growth rate of 12% has been assumed for tourist
traffic at Nairobi for the period up to 1975 and 15% from 1975 to 1980.
Foreign business traffic has grown at 22% annually during the past
decade. Considering that this growth was applied to a very small base
figure (4,000 passengers in 1960) and taking into account the diversionary
effect of Kilimanjaro and Mombasa Airports, it has been assumed that this
traffic will grow at a somewhat slower 13% per year during the current
decade.
The numbers of local residents traveling outside East Africa have
increased by about 2% per annum over the last 10 years. Although this
traffic is considered fairly inelastic to changes in air transport factors,



ANNEX 2
Page 2
it is expected that the effect of Kenya's increasing rate of economic growth
in stimulating travel by Kenvan businessmen and tourists will more than off-
set the diversionary effect of Kilimanjaro and Mombasa, resulting in a
growth rate of 2.7% up to 1980.
While traffic within Kenya and between Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania,
has grown at an average of 12.9% per year between 1960-68, growth has slowed
considerably in the past few years. This decline in growth rate is probably
due to the reduced economic dependence upon Kenya of the other two East
African countries and the slow growth rate of domestic traffic. It is con-
sidered likely that both these tendencies will continue. The East African
Community traffic will probably grow very slowly or even decline in the
early years while the diversionary effect of the new Mombasa Airport upon
international traffic after its opening in 1975 will produce a low domestic
traffic growth rate.
Transit passenger traffic has been growing at a rate of 13% per
year. A lower growth rate of 9% has been assumed up to 1980, taking into
consideration the general development of traffic in Africa projected by
ICAO and also taking into account the diversion, after the upgrading of
Mombasa, of inclusive tour traffic which now transits at Nairobi.
Forecasts for the second 10-year period, 1480-90, have been
based on a qualitative consideration of the continued rapid economic
development of Kenya, the centinued imDortance of transportation and
specifically air transportation in this development, and the continued,
although perhaps less rapid, growth in tourism to Kenya. Although no
major constraints to the development of passenger traffic are foreseen,
the extreme uncertainty of such long-term forecasting has prompted the
assumption of a conservative 11.5% growth rate for the combined catego~ries,
foreign tourists, foreign businessmen and local residents, and 5% for
traffic within East Africa.

NAIROBI AIRPORT PROJECT
The Evaluation of Economic Benefits of the Project
1.        This Annex describes, in further detail some of the methods
by which the project benefits were estimated.
Aircraft Benefits
2.        In order to estimate the reduction in aircraft operating costs
that the project would produce, the ground movement of aircraft in the
with and without project situatiome were compared by the use of simulation
models. An allowance was made for the changes in the fleet size and
composition serving Nairobi in the without project situation. Forecasts
of the type of aircraft likely to use Nairobi Airport in 1975 and 1985
were made and estimates of direct full operating costs per unit of time
were obtained from the best sources available including the U.S. Civil
Aeronautics Board. These costs were adjusted to reflect the gradual
increases in aircraft size o1rer time. The resulting operating cost per
large aircraft was K1530 in 1975, rising to KF900 in 1985. A separate
estimate of cost was made for other aircraft categories. These unit
costs were then applied to the average delay per movement for the
appropriate category of aircraft and the project benefits in avoiding
delays to aircraft were thus estimated. These total aircraft benefits
amount to K1775,000 per annum in 1976 and rise to about Kk4,750,000
per annum by 1985, of which just over KE4 million relate to the movement
cr large aircraft. The aircraft benefits estimated would accrue
initially to the operators of the aircraft including foreign airlines.
It has been estimated that of these savings, one third of those accrulng
to E.A.A., amounting to K1116,000 in 1976 and KL713,000 in 1985, would
accrue directly to the Kenyan economy.
The Loss of Foreign Visitors Arriving at Nairobi Airport
3.        The project is expected to affect the growth of passenger
traffic in two separate ways. First, the congestion without the project
would reach such levels that it would adversely affect the demand of
tourists and other passengers and second, the reduced capacity and
increased costs of using a congested airport would adversely influence
the frequency and quality of service provided by foreign airlines
serving Nairobi. The estimated effects on traffic of passenger and
aircraft operator reactions to inadeouate capacity are described
separately below.
a) Passenger Reaction to Inadequate Capacity
4.        Arriving and departing passengers will directly benefit from
the project principally through the improvement in processing times and
comfort in the new terminal building. Passenger delays were measured
by the use of models developed by the consultants, which sinilated the






ANNEX 4
Page 2
processing of passengers during peak and off-peak hours in the with
and without project situations. On the basis of these simulations
it has been estimated that in the absence of the project the overall
average additional delay per passenger would be 5.4 minutes in 1975
and it would rise to over 26 minutes by 1985. The average delay per
passenger in peak hours is only marginally higher than the overall
average in 1975 but by 1985 it is nearly 10 minutes more. The estimated
delays to passengers mentioned above are average overall delays which
include a significant number of extremely long delays. The simulations
carried out show that, without the project, of all internaticnal passengers
using the airport in 1985, at least 12% would experience excess delays of
1½ hours, more than 4% would incur excess delays of 23/4 hours and over
20,000 passengers would have to endure excess delays of more than 6 hours.
5.        Congestion involving delays of the magnitudes described abovre,
the occurrences of which are unpredictable by passengers, will deter a
significant number of foreign nationals from visiting Kenya. The
dampening effect of congestion on travel demand applies particularly to
tourists, since they face an increasingly wide and varied ch.sice of
rout,.,,, to   iii" csr).titiv  dcsti2rvticns.  It is wToll 'MorrT
that tourist attractions similar to those in Kenya exist and are being
developead in neighboring countries. Although many individual tourists
will not have personal exper-ence of the recent conditions at airports,
these conditions, if bad, sooni obtain a public notoriety. Tourists
are also increasingly guided in their decisions by travel agents and
the travel services industry which are generally well informed about
current conditions at specific airports. Moreover, an increasing
proportion of tourists travel on package tours and are influenced
in their choice of destinations by tour operators, whose operations
and profitability are directly affected by congestion at airports and
the unforeseen delays that it produces.
6.        A number of attempts have been made,in the field of air
traffic forecasting, to measure the clasticityof passenger demand relative
to time in order to predict the changes in passenger volumes that could
arise from changes in total journey times. A recently concluded studyl/
has specifically examined the senstivity of passengers to changes in journey
times on one of the international air routes serving Nairobi, the London-
Nairobi route. On this route, which at present carries more passengers
than any other route serving Nairobi, the study estimated the time elasticity
of demand factor to be -0.04, i.e. a 10% change in travelling time would
result in 0.4% change in travel volume. Other studies of air travel
patterns in Europe and in the U.S., where journey times are generally
shorter and where competing modes of travel are more important than they
are for international journeys to Nairobi, have estimated time elasticities
"Air transport demand elasticities for U.K. Domestic and International
routes", A. P. Ellison, London, 1971.






ANNEX 4
Page 3
of demand which are much higher, ranging from -0.4 for leisure passengers
to -1.5 for business travellers. London-Nairobi is one of the longest
direct air routes serving Nairobi and it is very likely that on some of
the shorter Nairobi air routes the time elasticity of demand would be
much higher than the -0.04 estimated for London-Nairobi. However, in
the absence of direct estimates of time elasticities on other Nairobi
routes the low factor of -0.04 has been assumed, in this analysis, to
apply to all routes serving Nairobi and has been used to assess the
passenger losses arising from delays at the airport. As the incidence
of these delays is unknown, the time elasticity factor has been applied
to the proportionate time change of the average overall delay to the
weighted average of the total journey times to Nairobi from all destinations.
Only foreign travellers arriving at Nairobi from outside the East African
Community have been considered. This calculaticn, a recognised under-
estimate on several counts, indicates that the project would prevent a loss
of foreign passengers at Nairobi that would reach an accumulated level
of some 15,000 by 1985.
b) Aircraft Operators Reaction to Inadeauate Capacity
7.        The congestion at Nairobi, if the project were not implemented,
would. not only give rise to substantial direct costs to foreign aircraft,
it would also mean that the aiz.port would be incapable of ace -mmodating
all the aircraft movements, particularly of large aircraft, that would
wish to use it at specified times. The inability of Nairobi to accept
all the aircraft movement demand at desirable times would thus involve
the total rejection of some potential flights while a number of othc-r flights
would have to change to smaller, less economic and less attractive aircraft
if they were to continue to serve Nairobi. Such changes in the size and
ccmposition of the foreign fleet serving Nairobi would have detrimental
effects on the effective demand for passenger journeys to Nairobi.
8.        Estimates were made of the reduction in the seats available on
scheduled international flights to Nairobi that the capacity limitations
at the airport would bring about. Since scheduled passenger services
dominate the peak periods at Nairobi, it was assumed that such reductions
in available seats would only occur on these scheduled services. The use
of smaller aircraft on some flights and lower frequencies of flights
necessitated by congestion would reduce available seats on international
scheduled flights by 13% (about 170,000 seats) in 1980 and by 21% (about
500,000 seats) in 1985. It has conservatively been assumed that all the
projected business passengers, who would have travelled on these lost
seats, will, given the nature of business journeys, be accommodated on
alternative flights with low load factors serving Nairobi. Some 53,000
of the projected tourist passengers on scheduled services in 1980, and
167,000 in 1985, will also lose the seats on which they would have
travelled. There are a number of reasons why not all of these tourists
could be expected to be accommodated on other existing flights. Firstly,
the assumed accommodation of all the affected business passengers on






ANNEX 4
Page 4
other flights would raise the load factors on international scheduled
flights from all destinations to Nairobi to an anmual average approaching
65%, which in the light of the seasonal variations in demand at Nairobi
implies an average load factor in the high seasons of nearly 75%. This
is a very high overall average, which cculd only be achieved with
a large picoportion of flights from particular points of origin being
fully occupied in the high seasons: the scope for raising it further
by accormizdating additional passeligers is therefore limited.  Secondly,
much of the toarist demand for travel arises at specific times on
specific days and the timing of such demand is determined by the pattern
of holidays and the leave from work. Alternative capacity on other
existing flights will not always match demand in time, and if airline
seats to Nairobi are not available at tlese times, tornrists may well
choose alternative vacation destinations.  Thus, the demands of a large
proportion of the tourists affected by the reduction in seats would not
be met on alternative flights. Nevertheless, in this analysis, it has
been assumed, very conservatively, that only 15% of the affected tourists
would be unable to find suitable alternative seats to Nairobi and would
therefore travel to different locations. This gives rise to an annual
loss of some 26,000 arrivin- tourists at Nairobi Airport by 1985.
9.        the losses of passengers arriving at Nairobi, arising fran the
two effects described above, amount to over 40,000 per annum by 1985.
These losses will basically involve two types of passengers. Firstly,
there will be suppressed traffic,  i.e. those passengers who, givfrn the
congestion at Nairobi, will decide to make trips to alternative
destinations outside Kenya and not visit Kenya at all. As Nairobi Airport
is the principal international gateway to Kerya, most of the passengers
that the delays will deter are likely to fall in this category. Secondly,
there will be some diverted traffic, i.e. passengers who, given the
congestion at Nairobi, will switch to other modes of travel to Kenya.
This might mean that some passengers will travel by air to I4omb"sa
Airport when it is able to accept direct scheduled international services,
and then malke  journeys to Nairobi or travel to other locations in KiMnya.
It might also, and more probably would, mean that passengers would travel
to internaticnal airports in nearby adjoining countries, from where they
might make short trips into Kenya as a part of a package trip to East
Africa. As a reliable objective way of differentiating between the
suppressed and diverted traffic does not exist, it has conservatively
been assumed that the passenger traffic loss at Nairobi would be equally
distributed between these two categories. It has further been assumed
that the diverted passengers would not give rise to any losses to the
Kenyan economy despite the fact that such diversion would probably involve
shorter stays in Kenya and visits to parts of the country where consumption
expenditure opportunities are less than they are in Nairobi. Thus, only
one half of the estimated foreign passengers lost at Nairobi were taken
as causing losses to the Kenyan economy.
Loss of Airport Revenues
10.       The airport landing fee revenue earned from foreign airlines in
the with project si4uation was compared with the revenues that would be






ANMEX 4
Page 5
earned in the without project situation. The difference in revenue,
which arises from the reduced number and size of aircraft, produces
project benefits that rise to over KK1.6 million per annum by 1985.
The incremental passenger charges attributable to the project and the
incremental rentals fram airlines (net of increased operating costs)
amount to KL300,000 and KU210,000 per annum ros-ooctivel'y by 1985.

User Charges
A.   Introudction
Nairobi Airport plays a key role in Kenya's overall development
effort. It is not only an important gateway for tourism which is a major
and rapidly growing source of foreign exchange for the country; the airport
itself is also a significant contributor to the national development budget.
Estimated net income from the airport has amounted to over KE 3.3 million
(US$9.2 million) in the past three years. This is the result of a specific
objective on the part of the Government that user charges at the airport
should contribute as much as possible to the National Treasury for use in
other sectors of the economy.
a.   Historical Development
When the airport opened in 1958 user charges consisted only of
landing and parking fees, ground handling charges and terminal space rentals.
With the promulgation of the East Africa Air Navigation Regulations in 1965,
two new charges were introduced; a housing or hangar fee and a fueling service
fee. The housing fees are still in effect although they have never been
charged due to the lack of suitable hangar facilities at the airport. The
fueling service fee, which was assessed directly on the airlines, was withdrawt.
in 1966 at the insistence of ICAO which found the charges to be in violation
of Article 24 of the Chicago Convention.
In 1967 the Government increased landing fees by about 25% which
was estimated to provide about the same revenue as would have been provided
by the fueling service fee.
Terminal space rentals have been revised twice, once in 1966 with
an increase of about 45%, and again in 1969 with a further increase of about
17%. The original rentals and all revisions, as set by the Senior Valuer
of Government, have been based on the rentals charged for comparable spaces
in the central part of Nairobi.
Concession fees have also been introduced for all shops with
annual rent greater than KP 500 (US$1,400). The concession fees are
usually determined in the bid process for the particular concession and
may be either a flat fee, a percentage of gross takings, or a combination.
A number of other small charges have also been introduced for livestock
holding, the waving base, advertising, toilets, etc.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
The most recent user charge introduced has been the passenger
departure tax, passed by Parliament in November 1970. This charge had
been proposed several years earlier but had been turned aside by the ob-
jections of the Ministry of Tourism. Its final introduction was the re-
sult of a strong request by the Ministry of Finance for additional revenue
from the airport. No particular criterion was applied in determining the
level of the tax. The original proposal was 20 sh per departing passenger
but, with Uganda charging 7.50 sh and Tanzania charging 15.00 sh, the tax
wast set at 100.000 sh.
b.   User Charge Collection and Disposition
Landing fees, parking fees and the passenger departure tax are
considered as direct revenue to the Government Treasury. They are collected
by the airport, on behalf of the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of
Power and Communications.
Income from ground handling fees, concession royalties, the live-
stock holding charge, advertising charges and other miscellaneous charges
are considered as "appropriations-in-aid", and are collected by the airport
and netted from that part of aerodromes' operating expenditures controlled
by the Ministry of Power and Communications.
Terminal space rentals are collected by the Ministry of Works as
"appropriations-in-aid" netted from its expenditure on the maintenance of
aerodromes. Ground rents are collected by the Commissioner of Lands who
passes them directly to the Treasury.
C.   The Present Situation and Future Development
The main impact of user charges is on the airlines who pay the
landing fees and rentals for space at the airport. The landing fees produce
by far the largest part of the revenue.
Landing Fees
For a number of airlines the main reason for landing at Nairobi
is not its traffic generation but rather its function as a technical stop
for fueling and other en-route services on flights between Europe and
points further south, primarily Johannesburg.   Nairobi is situated on the
flight path for transcontinental services. Nairobi's runway, fueling system,
and crash, fire and rescue system are recognized as being better than those
at other airports in the region that might generate possible competition.
The presence of East African Airways' major maintenance facility is also
considered an advantage. As neighboring airports such as Kilimanjaro,
Entebbe and Mombasa, come into competition with Nairobi and as traffic and
the airlines' frequency of operations increase, the Government will have to
study the user charges system and more particularly its effect on the air-
lines.



ANNEX 5

Space Usage in the Terminal Buildings
With the low present level of operations of individual airlines,
there is no active demand from them for their own individual ticket or check-
in counters at the airport. Such services are being contracted from East
African Airways. With the projected build-up of traffic at Nairobi, it is
likely that most airlines will require their own facilities at the airport.
The project makes provision for this anticipated demand.
The financial projections envisage that the Government should be
able to institute a user charges scheme related to the operating costs of
the terminal buildings. The development of a user charges system related
to costs and geared to maintain Nairobi's pre-eminent position among the air-
ports of the region is a requirement under the proposed lending arrangements.

4.   Passenger Departure Tax:  To continue at the same rate of Ksh 10
per passenger through December, 1975.  on completion of the terminal buil-
ding this rate is assumed to increase to Ksh 15 to provide the contribution
towards annual cost recovery (see para. 5 below).  The rates are applied

Factors have been introduced for converting areas into rental units so as
to reflect not only the cost differences among various parts of the building,
but also their attractiveness. For exaiaple, baggage processing areas and
waving bay are graded with a factor of 1, whereas administration offices
and public lounges are factorized by 3.
Nonrentable Space: The passenger departure tax above provides
for the cost recovery pertainin- to this space.



ANNEX 5

Airlines Space: Directly rentable space to individual airlines
would cover 6,960 units producing an annual income of KE 60,000
to 75,000 in stepped increases. There would be a balance still
remaining to be recovered, and relating directly to general pas-
senger handling facilities. A fair division of cost among air-
lines would therefore appear to be a rental charge based on the
number of passengers carried by each airline. At the same time
it is not considered equitable to attempt a full recovery at
least while the airlines are bearing the full burden of paying
the landing fees which bring in about 2/3rds of the total re-
venue. However, until a full study of the user charges system
is undertaken by the Government and the Department (referred to
earlier in para. 6.03 of this report), the increase of Ksh 5 per
departing pasaenger discussed in para. 4 above is included as
an interim measure of contribution towards cost recovery per-
taining to this space.
Concession Space: Fully and directly rentable space covering
9,022 units (3,173 sq m) producing an annual income of KE 50,000
to 60,000 in stepped increase. The foregoing and concession
rights income for catering and shops more than cover the cost
recovery pertaining to this space.

Estimated annual cost to be recovered would be Kh 493,000 for passenger
and KE 110,000 for freight terminals. However, this is presumed to be
offset against the landing fee.
7.   Rentals - Freight Terminal:  Estimated annual cost to be recovered
would be KE 150,000 covering 11,564 sq m or 21,866 rental units, producing
an annual income of KE 120,000 to 150,000 in stepped increases.
8.   Terminals - Landside - Parking:  The annual cost to be recovered
would be Kh 67,000 and this would be collected as follows.

9.   Old Terminal Lease:  It is assumed that it would be used for
aviation-oriented activities such as training classrooms, producing an
annual income of KE 27,000.
10. Ground Leases: Based on stepped increase from the existing in-
come of KE 6,000 per annum to KE 10,000.
11. Concession Rights - Catering and Shops: Based on estimated
annual growth with an increase in fiscal 1977 as a result of newly negoti-
ated terms.
12. General: It should be understood that the above-mentioned rates
have been evolved strictly for purposes of the financial projections forming
part of this report. The ultimate responsibility for developing and nego-
tiating the level and structure of user charges policies, systems and
rates designed to increase revenues, cover costs and leave sufficient net
incomes to ensure reasonable rates of return on the net average fixed
assets in use and to justify future additional investment, would rest
with the Government and the Department and its financial management (see
para. 6.02 of this report establishing financial objectives for the air-
port).

NAIROBI AIRPORT PROJECT
Assumptions Used in Financial Projections
1.   Operating Revenues:  Calculations based on projected user charges
discussed in section C of Annex 5.
2.   Personnel Costs and Benefits:  Based on present costs of Ministry of
Power and Communications and Ministry of Works (including costs of non-
established positions, i.e., labor) plus a housing allowance of 10% and
terminal benefit of 20% on the base salary costs. Annual increase 5%.
Additional staff 5% increase in 1972 and 10% increase in 1976. Administra-
tion support costs at the rate of KE 30,000 per annum included for years
1977, 1978 and 1979.
3.   Ground Handling Services:  Increase on the same basis of growth as
ground handling services fees.
4.   Repair and Maintenance:  2% of investment costs for annual repair and
maintenance with an annual increase of 7%.
5.   Utilities:  Include electricity, water and sewage treatment system
less collections from users.
6.   Communications:  Include postage, telegrams and telephones, less col-
lection from users of telephone installations.
7.   Depreciation:  Annual depreciation of fixed assets is calculated on
the straightline basis, and the following rates apply:
Land                                            none
Runway, taxiways, and aprons                      5%
Roads and utilities                               5%
Buildings                                         5%
Equipment                                        10%
Old terminal complex                              5%
The new terminal building facilities will become operational as of January 1,
1976, i.e. mid-fiscal 1976.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
8.   Write-Offs:  The cost of current work in the amount of Kf 800,000 for
expanding the existing terminal building is written off in equal amounts
of KE 200,000 in the years 1972 through 1975.
The cost of experts, accounting consultants and training in the
amount of Kf 384,000 incurred during the construction period is written
off in equal amounts of KE 48,000 in the years 1977 through 1984.
9.   Interest:  The proposed Bank loan would bear interest at 7-1/4% p.a.
and would be repayable in approximately equal semi-annual installments over
20 years, including a 5-year grace period.
Interest and commitment charges during the construction period
and interest thereafter are treated as current non-operating expenses and
included in the projected operating results.
10. Accounts Receivable: Are calculated on the basis that approximately
one month's operating revenues of a given year would be outstanding as at
the end of the year.
11. Accounts Payable and Accruals: Are calculated on the basis that
approximately one month's cash operating expenses excluding personnel
costs and benefits of a given year would remain unsettled as at the end
of the year.
