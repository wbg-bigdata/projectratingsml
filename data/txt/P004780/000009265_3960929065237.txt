MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
KINGDOM OF THAILAND FOR A SECOND LAND TITLING PROJECT
1.    The following Memorandum and Recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Kingdom of Thailand for US$30.0 million is submitted for app;oval. The proposed
loan would be for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate and would finance a land titling proj ct. The project
would be co-financed by a US$5.2 million equivalent grant from the Australian
International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
2.    Background.   Four-fifths of Thailand's population still live in rural
areas and, for the most part, they depend directly or indirectly on the
agricultural sector. During 1960-1975, the sector performed exceptionally well,
with rapid growth achieved mostly through expansion of cultivated area.
Subsequently, growth has slowed somewhat and has come to rely increasingly on
intensification of crop production. In future, much greater investments in the
land will be needed. For the majority of farmers, this will require medium or
long-term credit, which financial institutions are generally willing to provide
only against collateral (usually in the form of land with a full title deed).
However, farmers occupying about 712 of the total cultivated -rea in the country
still have no title deeds to their land and, therefore, no access to such credit.
The limitations which this poses on potential farm inve,'.ment and productivity
improvement are significant for the national economy.
3.    Such concerns have led the Royal Thai Government to take various measures
to establish a policy and administrative framework to foster better land
utilization. A Land Code adopted in 1954 provides the basis for the current land
administration system, designed to control land use, determine ownership and
generate land revenues. The Department of Lands (DOL) was progressively expanded
and strengthened to implement the system, but by the 1970s the demand for land
titling had incr"ased sharply, exceeding DOL's capability.   As an interim
measure, DOL issued certificates of utilization, which are now being converted
to title deeds. To speed up title issuance, in 1984 the Government initiated
a 20-year Accelerated National Cadastral Mapping and Land Titling Program, the
first phase of which has been supported by the Land Titling Project (LTP) under
Ln. 2440-TH, co-financed by an AIDAB grant for technical assistance and training.
The LTP, covering Bangkok and nine of the Kingdom's 72 provinces, includes
cadastral surveying and mapping, the issuance of land titles, improvement of land
administration, strengthening of DOL and the Central Valuation Authority (CVA),
and technical assistance and training.  With the project now in the mi.dle of
its sixth and final year, implementation has been satisfactory and the loan is
expected to be fully disbursed on schedule. While it is premature to quantify
the socio-economic impact of LTP itself, ongoing surveys have shown that land
values, access to institutional credit and land productivity have all improved
as a result of titling. The efficiency of property and transfer tax collections
has also improved:  DOL revenues increased substantially during 1986-88, due
both to more frequent transactions and to higher land valuation assessments.
The proposed second-phase project would help to consolidate advances to date in
surveying and mapping methods, tested under LTP, as well as support the
introduction of several additional technological improvements designed to
increase DOL's efficiency and accuracy. The recommendations of an Organization,
Management and Operations Study carried out under LTP and aimed at improving land



administration and strengthening DOL's institutional capacity, would also be
progressively implemented. Efforts to strengthen CVA would be intensified, and
more appropriate appraisal methods would be intrcduced to supplement those tested
under LTP.
4.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank is already invnlved in the first
phase of the Accelerated National Cadastral Mapping and Land Titling Program
under LTP, and the proposed project would constitute the second phase. There
is a need to continue support for the actions introduced under LTP, in order to
consolidate the improvements in the operatlinal capacity of DOL, introduce
further technological advances in the land mapping and titling processes, and
extend the benefits of land titling to a larger area of the country.   The
project's objectives are consistent with the Bank's country assistance strategy
for Thailand, as they address the key issues of rural poverty and
underemployment, and promote the enhanced use of land resources through
productivity improvement, agricultural intensification and diversification.
5.    Project Objectives.  The project aims to extend secure, documented land
tenure to rural landholders, thereby facilitating their access to institutional
credit, encouraging greater investments in the land, and increasing agricultural
productivity and family incomes. The project would address directly the problems
of rural poverty and underemployment, and related land management issues. In
addition, the completion of an improved national cadastre would greatly assist
the Government agencies responsible for development planning and land
administration, and more accurate property valuation and tax assessments would
strengthen the fiscal system and increase Government revenues, particularly in
urban areas.
6.    Project Description.  The four-year project would support the second phase
of the Government's Accelerated National Cadastral Mapping and Land Ti -ing
Program (para. 3). It would cover the remainder of Bangkok and 30 provinces not
assisted under the first phase, including 16 provinces of mainly high value rural
land in the lower North and upper Central regions, six provinces in the less
developed Northeast region, and eight provinces with land earmarked for intensive
development on the Eastern seaboard. The project would support: (a) accelerated
rural and urban cadastral mapping; (b) issuance of land titles and improved land
administration through decentralization of the land register from provincial to
branch level and the development of a pilot land information system;
(c) strengthening of the Central Valuation Authority; (d) strengthening of the
Department of Lands; and (e) project-related training and studies. The project
would finance civil works, aerial photography, vehicles, equipment, furniture,
materials, technical assistance, training, studies and related development costs.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$73.0 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$17.0 million (23?). The latter 4ncludes US$5.2 million
equivalent for technical assistance and training, which would be co-financed with
a grant from AIDAB. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.   Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Thailand are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively.   IBRD Map No. 21956R is also attached.   The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 8538-TH, dated August 1, 1990, is being distributed
separately.

7.    Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government on the following: (a) promptly after land surveys in the project
area, title deeds would be issued to all occupants of private land in accordance
with the Land Code and all land uszd for public purposes would be covered by
appropriate State land documents; (b) DOL would submit a master plan for the
development of the  Central  Valuation  Authority to the Bank for review by
October 1, 1991; and (c) DOL would submit final reports on the Land Policy,
Management and Administration study and the Socio-Economic Impact Study to the
Bank for review by February 1, 1994.
8.    Benefits.  The benefits expected under the project do not lend themselves
to conventional rate of return (ERR) analysis. However, improved security of
tenure is expected to result in increased access to institutional credit, heavier
input use and on-farm investments; higher productivity, beneficiary incomes and
land values, reduction of land conflicts and increased Government revenues.
These impact assumptions are based on Bank-supported research findings (para. 3).
Also, while titles are not awarded for any land in the area of forest reserves,
there is a presumption that land titling will make a positive environmental
contribution by providing security and opening the way for more intensive land
use, thereby reducing encroachment into forest reserves by farmers who would
otherwise resort to shifting cultivation. An estimated 700,000 rural landholding
families would benefit directly from the project. For urban areas, a parcel-
based land information system would provide the institutional infrastructure for
site screening and enforcement of site development guidelines, and should
ultimately facilitate the Government's ability to protect ecologically vulnerable
areas and to cope with social impacts such as resettlement.
9.    Risks. The level of risk associated with this project is low. The various
participating agencies all support the project and are committed to its
objectives. Most of the technical innovations in the project have already been
tested, some on a pilot basis, and are not expected to present any significant
training or implementation problems.
10.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
