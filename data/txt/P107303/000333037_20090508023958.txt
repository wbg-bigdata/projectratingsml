Risks andRisk   The program faces three main risks. (a) Impact of the global
Mitigation       economic crisis. The global economic slowdown poses
                 significant risks to growth through reduced exports, remittances,
                 andforeign investment. While this impact may somehow be
                mitigated by declining fertilizer, food, and fuel prices, there is
                 still a risk that a protractedrecession indeveloped countries will
               putpressure on the fiscal andbalance of payments positions. In
                 this context, we are particularly concerned with its impact on
                 agricultural reforms, given that Malawi is currently implementing
                 a large fertilizer subsidy program and pursuinga heavily
                managed exchange rate. To mitigate the risk,the Bank together
                with other development partners is engaged inpolicy dialogue
                with the authorities inorder to avoid losing momentum inthe
                reform program. (b) Political risk.Malawi goes to the polls on
                May 19,2009. Follow-up to some reforms supported by the
                program will depend on the political landscape that will emerge
                 after the elections. To mitigate against this risk, the Bank will
                utilize the leverage that the common approach to budget support
                 grouping has infacing difficult policy issues with Government.
                (c) Capacity risks. The systemic problem o f capacity in
                Government continues to pose a risk for the program and may
                cause delays inimplementation of some measures, especially in
                public sector reform. To mitigate this risk, the Bank has technical
                 assistanceprograms inpublic finance management, agriculture,
               andprivate sector development, all covering reforms supported
                 by the PRSC series.

                                 I. INTRODUCTION

1.        This programdocument proposesa SecondPoverty Reduction Support
Grant (PRSC-2) to the Republic of Malawi for SDR 20.1 million (US$30million
equivalent). Itwill bethe second ina series of three annual programmatic development
policy lending (DPL) operations that are aimed at supportingthe Government's reform
program inthe implementation of the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy
(MGDS). The MGDS i s the country's second generation PRSP.

2.        As was the case with PRSC-1, the proposedPRSC-2 is being designedand
implemented within a harmonized framework for the provision of budget support in
Malawi. Such a framework exists under the leadership of the Government of Malawi
(GoM) with five participating donors, including IDA.' It comprises of a Joint
Framework, or memorandumo f understanding, a multi-year Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF), and a review process aimed at reducingtransaction costs for all
parties involved.

3.        The program document is divided intosix sections, includingthis
introduction. Section I1discusses the country context which gives an overview of
Malawi, recent economic developments including the impact of recent exogenous shocks,
macroeconomic outlook, and debt sustainability. Section I11presents the Government's
program (MGDS), section IV discusses how the Bank i s supporting the government
program, while section V describes the proposedsecond PRSC. Section VI describes
implementationissues, with a focus on risks and mitigating measures.

                               11.  COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                   A. Country Overview

4.       Malawihas recently registeredhigh growth rates, following a history of
volatile and low growth. GDP growth inthe last three years has beenhigh, averaging
8.3 percent: 6.7 percent in2006, 8.6 percent in2007, and 9.7 percent in2008. Growth for
2009 is projected at 6.9 percent (See Table 1for a summary o f key macroeconomic
indicators). This performancehas been anchored by strong growth inagriculture
(particularly smallholder agriculture), construction, finance and insurance, and in
information andtelecommunications. It has also beenhelpedby improved
macroeconomicmanagement, good weather, and a supportive donor environment. Prior
to the recent feat of relatively sustained highgrowth, macroeconomic management was
generally weak. Together with the country's over-dependence on rain-fed agriculture, and
highlyconcentrated exports, growth hadgenerally been low andvolatile. Between 1999
and 2004, average growth per annumwas only 2 percent.

          5.        While progress has been registered insome social indicators, the overall
          picture remains poor. In2005, the poverty headcount was 52.4 percent, marginally
          down from 54.2 percent in 1998 However, a 2007 welfare monitoring survey reporteda
          poverty headcount of 40 percent, indicating that poverty may have declined inthe last
          few years, inline with the highgrowth rates registered.2 Ineducation, there have been
          improvements inschool attendance levels. Duringthe last decade, the proportion of men
          who had never attended school droppedfrom 21percent to 12percent, while that of
          women dropped from 47 percent to 23 percent. On the other hand, inhealth, life
          expectancy has declined from 46 years in1987 to 37 years in2005, largely due to the
          HIV/AIDS epidemic. Childhood immunizationhas also decreased from 82 percent in
          1992to 64 percent in2004. Maternal mortality rates have increased from 620 in 1992 to
          960 in2004, although they are now on a decreasing trend. Child malnutrition has
          remained virtually unchanged since 1992, and almost half of the children under five years
          of age inMalawi are stunted, with 22 percent severely stunted. On a positive note, trends
          inunder-five mortality and infantmortality haveimproved steadilyover the pasttwo
          decades. Similarly, Malawi appears to be makingprogress incontaining the spread o f
          HIV/AIDS, as adult prevalence rates dropped from 14.4 percent in2004 to 12 percent in
          2007.

          6.        Given Malawi's high level of poverty and vulnerability to shocks, food
          security remains a critical issue. The functioning o f domestic input and output markets
          inthe agriculture sector continueto dominatethe policyagenda.Withthe majority of the
          population livingbelow the poverty line, ensuring food security has always been a major
          development objective. Inthis regard, policies governing domestic agriculture markets
          for inputs andproduce have been central to the development discourse, and politically

            Comprehensive data onpoverty are collected through the IntegratedHousehold Survey (IHS). The first
          M S was carried out in 1997/98 while the second was conducted in2004/05. The next IHS is planned for
          2009/2010.

sensitive. Inthe fertilizer market, the focus of Government has been the implementation
of a price subsidy program which i s designed to play food security and social protection
roles by enhancing productivity inmaize which i s the key staple, and tobacco, which is
the main cash crop. Although the subsidy program i s intended for poorer farmers,
targeting has been a major challenge, andprogram costs have been escalating. Regarding
the output market, policies have mainly centered on the operations o f the state marketing
board, namely, the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC),
which continues to play a predominant role inthe maize markets. Inparticular, attention
inrecent years hasbeenfocused onhow to improve the parastatal's efficiency and
provide a more stable and enhanced role for the private sector.

7.      Malawi's exports have been heavily concentrated in agriculture, with the
newly opened uraniummine being the only significant non-agriculture source of
export. As mentioned earlier, Malawi's exports have beenhighly concentrated in
agriculture. Tobacco, tea and sugar alone account for 75 percent of total export earnings
The newly opened uraniummine i s the only significant non-agriculture source of export.
Starting from 2009, uraniumexports will account for 25 percent o f Malawi's export
earnings per year. Otherwise Malawi's highdependence on agriculture exports has left
the economy vulnerable to fluctuations inagricultural commodity prices. Therefore, for
growth to be sustained there i s need for an export diversification drive inorder to reduce
inherent risks associated with agriculture. Inthis context, Malawi needs to build on recent
progress where non-traditional exports to the region grew by 14.6 percent duringthe
period 2000-2006.

                               B. RecentEconomicDevelopments

Macroeconomicperformance

8.         Malawi's macroeconomic program remains broadly on track but has been
strained by expansion of the fertilizer subsidy program. Malawi i s currently
implementinga one-year arrangementunder the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) that
was approvedby the IMFBoard onDecember 3,2008, following a successful sixth and
final review o f a three-year PRGFon July 14, 2008. An IMFmissionthat visited Malawi
inMarch2009 concludedthat the ESFprogramremainsbroadly ontrack (See
Assessment Letter inthe Annex) inspite o f being severely strained by a significant
expansion o f the fertilizer subsidy program. InDecember 2008 and early January 2009,
anadditional 72,000 metric tons of fertilizer was procuredover and above the planned
170,000 metric tons for the 2008/09 season, representing a 45 percent increase involume
terms. Since this additional fertilizer was not distributed and the season i s now over, the
purchase will be financed and suppliers paid by a combination of a short term bridge
loan from commercial banks through a buy-back arrangement, andthrough additional
domestic borrowing. Ultimately, the government i s incurring ina large loss o f roughly
US$35 million --equivalent to the difference between the price it paid and the market


 The recently finalized Country Economic Memorandum preparedby Bank staff incollaboration with
DFTD,AfDB, and the Millennium Challenge Corporationoffers usefulrecommendations onhow Malawi
can seize opportunities for growththrough trade, particularly with the region.

price of this 72,000 tons of fertili~er.~The IMFhas since reached an agreement ad
referendum with the authorities on an updated macroeconomic framework and policies
for the period aheadthat the staff plansto present to the IMFExecutive Board inJune,
2009.

9.         Similarly, overvaluation of the Malawi Kwacha againstmajor currencies
has resultedina depletion of foreign reservesand significantly reduced
competitivenessof Malawi's exports. The nominal exchange rate has remained stable
vis-&vis the US dollar since 2006, but significantly gained value against other currencies.
As a result, the IMFhas recently reclassifiedthe exchange rateregime as a defacto
conventional peg, and estimates that the Malawi Kwacha may be over-valued by 15
percent. Partly as a result of this policy, Malawihas failed to buildup its reserves which
are precariously low, at 1.1months o f prospective imports as at end-February, 2009.
Similarly, the parallel exchange rate commands a highpremiumof at least 20 percent and
there are signs of a buildup of unpaid import invoices due to shortages inforeign
exchange. Further, there has been deterioration inthe competitiveness o f Malawi's
exports, particularly inthe non-traditional sector that i s geared mostly to sub-regional
markets. The authorities planto adopt a more flexible exchange rate system soon, and
various options were discussed duringthe March 2009 IMFmission as part of the Article
IV Consultations.

10.        Inspiteof these challenges, inflationhasbeenlow, remaining within single
digits since 2007. The headline inflation rate reached single digits inJanuary 2007,
reaching as low as 7.1 percent inSeptember 2007. Although inflation has remained
below ten percent untilnow, it started rising towards the second half o f 2008 due to the
lagged impact of global fuel price increases experienced inthe first half of the year (See
Figure 1).InJune 2008, fuel pump prices were adjusted upwardsby 25 percent.
Subsequently, inflation rose from As o f February 2009, headline inflation had reached
9.7 percent, while food and non-food inflation had reached 8.8 percent and 10.8 percent,
respectively.




4Under the buy-back arrangement, SFFRFM will sell off the excess fertilizer to commercial banks at the
current market price which is 60% lower than the original purchaseprice, and thenbuy back the fertilizer
next seasonat the same lower price. The proceedsfromthe sale of the fertilizer to the commercial banks
will be usedto pay off the suppliers, but at the original highprice. Governmentwill help cover the
difference through a subventionto SFFRFMcurrently estimatedat around$35 millionthat will be reflected
as expenditureinthe 2008/09budget. The funds for this subvention will be raisedthrough domestic
borrowing.

11.       Real interest rates have been declining, which has contributed to an
increase in commercial banklendingto the private sector. Following a significant
reduction in Government borrowing through treasury bills and declining inflation, the
bankratehas beenreduced a number of times inrecent years, the latest being a reduction
from 17.5 percent to 15 percent inNovember, 2007. Commercial bank lending rates have
followed suit, with the prime lendingrate currently at an average o f 19.75 percent, down
from 21 percent inDecember 2007. As a result, credit to the private sector has been
increasing. For example, between January 2008 and January 2009, commercial bank
lendingto the private sector increased by40 percent, which is likely to have contributed
to the increase inprivate investment from 11.7 percent o f GDP in2007 to 18.2 percent in
2008.

12.       Public debt has generally declined although the fertilizer subsidy program
has recently contributed to a rise indomestic debt. Malawireached the HIPC
Completion Point inAugust 2006 and subsequently qualified for the MDRI. This
resulted ina decline of the debt-to-exports ratio from 235.3 percent in2005 to 40.9
percent in2006. Further, reducing domestic debthas been a cornerstone of the fiscal
strategy embodied inthe Government's budgets inrecent years. From 16.4 percent o f
GDPin2004, domestic debt had declinedto 11.8 percent of GDPby end 2007. This
achievement has beenpossible due to two major factors. First, the Government has used a
good portion o f increased foreign flows (from debt relief andbudget support), and
increased tax revenues, to reduce the stock of domestic debt. Second, the authorities have
adhered to strict fiscal discipline inthe execution of the budget. However, increased
expenditures on the fertilizer subsidyprogram inrecent times have led an increase in
domestic debt, which shot up to 19.0 percent of GDP in2008.

Recent movements infood, fuel, andfertilizer prices

13.        There hasbeena significant increaseinfoodpricessince the beginningof
2008 that has even surpassed the peak reachedduring the drought year of 2006.
Although Malawi has registeredgood maize harvests inthe past two years, andmore
recently imposed export restrictions, the prices o f maize have been on a risingtrend since
the beginning of the 2008, suggesting linkages to soaring world food prices during the
first half of 2008. Further, unlike inmany other years, there was no sustained drop in
prices inthe post-harvest season. Prices started risingas the market reacted to uncertainty
inworld prices, reachingalevelthat was evenhigher than at the peak ofthe 2006
drought (See Figure 2). Inresponse to the perception that the market had over-reacted,
the Government decided to intervene by introducing a ban on maize trading by the
private sector inAugust 2008, and designated ADMARC as the sole buyer and seller of
maize at set prices. The authorities had indicated that the banwas temporary, although it
remains inplace untilnow.

14.        Recordincreasesinglobalfertilizer pricesinmid-2008havehad a
significant negativeimpact on the Government's budgetand the balance of
payments.Fertilizer prices on the world market more thandoubled between2007 and
2008. For example, the world price of Urea was US$300 per ton inM a y 2007 but had
risento US$630 per ton inMay 2008. Although prices have since come down, the earlier
increase has already had a significant negative impact on the Government's budget and
the balance of payments, through the national fertilizer subsidyprogram.

15.         The Governmentis implementingafertilizer subsidy programwhose cost
hasrisensignificantly.The programwas introducedin2005/06 andhas becomethe
cornerstoneof the Government's food security program. It is intendedto target poor
smallholder farmers who would otherwise not afford fertilizers at commercialprices. In
spite of increases inprices, the Governmenttook a decisionto maintainthe size of the
program, which has come at significant fiscal cost. The cost of implementinga 170,000
metric ton programhas increasedfrom $138 million (or 3 percentof GDP) in2007/08, to
$209 million(or 4.7 percent of GDP) in2008/09.

16.         The expansionof the programhasfurther widenedthe fiscalgap.To cover
the additionalcost equivalentto 1.7 percent, the Governmentplannedto reduce
expenditure levels for some budgetitems (equivalentto 0.4 percent of GDP) while it
expectedto also closethe gap by an additional0.8 percent of GDP throughhighertax
revenues. Developmentpartnerswere also asked to assist infilling the remainderof the
financing gap, equivalent to 0.5 percentof GDP. However, the expansionof the subsidy
programlater inthe year has ledto a widening of the fiscal gap which Government plans
to fill through domestic borrowing.

17.         Malawihasalso beenadverselyaffectedby the increaseinglobalfuel
pricesthat occurredearlier in2008. Fuelconstitutes 15percent of Malawi's total
imports.The total fuel import bill in2007 was US$157 million, or 4.2 percent of GDP.
Together with increaseddemandfor fuel associatedwith high economic growth rates, the


                                                - 16-

increase inglobal fuel prices has contributed to a doubling of Malawi's fuel import bill
over the past year. According to the Reserve Bank o f Malawi, the average monthly fuel
bill rose from US$11million duringthe period January to June in2007 to US$20million
duringthe same period in2008. Inspite of recent decreases infuel prices, Malawi's
annual import bill by the end of 2008 will still be significantly higher compared to 2007.
This has put a severe strain on international reserves. Further, the earlier global fuel
increases resulted ina 25 percent increase inpump prices that was effected inJune 2008,
one of the highest inrecent years. As mentioned earlier, the increase infuel pump prices
has partly contributedto the recent rise inMalawi's inflation rate.

18.        The Government'sresponsehasbeento minimizethe impactof the global
priceincreaseson pumpprices,without providingdirect subsidies.The Government
responded by giving up two levies, the safety net levy andthe Malawi EnergyRegulatory
Authority (MERA) levy inorder to augment the price stabilization fund (PSF).' While
the MERA levy was already scheduled to be discontinued after the establishment of the
institution, the removal of the safety net levy constitutes an indirect subsidy, since the
levy used to contribute to the national budget. It i s estimated that by giving up the safety
net levy, the Government has foregone annual revenue amounting to US$15 million,
equivalent to 0.4 percent of GDP.

Impact of the internationalfinancial crisis

19.        The impactof the financialcrisis on Malawihasso far beenlimited.The
bankingsector and the stock market are small. Neither of the two dominant commercial
banks, the National Bankof Malawi(NBM) andStandard Bank (which is South African
owned) have been severely affectedby the international crisis. However, there are
indications that most commercial bankshave considerable volumes of letters o f credit
andtherefore trade finance couldbecome an issue whose magnitude we cannot now
predict.

20.        Inthe mediumto longterm, the second roundeffectsof the financialcrisis
couldhave a significantnegativeimpactonMalawithroughitsimpacton
commodityexports,remittances,and risksof lower aid. Malawi's productive sector
could be severely affected through reduced demand for the country's exports, mainly
tobacco, sugar, and tea. These exports are particularly vulnerable because the EU, South
Africa, andthe U S are the principal destinations. Further, Malawireceives around 4
percent o f GDP inunrequited private transfers from abroad, and it is estimated that
remittances account for a significant proportion o f such transfers. Therefore, a slowdown
inthe world's economy, andespecially SouthAfrica, is likelyto have significant
negative impact on Malawi's current account. Finally, there i s a risk that the economic
slowdown may reduce donors' ability to maintain current aid levels.




 The Price Stabilization Fund(PSF) is a fund that i s used to stabilize fuel pumpprices. It i s financed
through a levy on the in-bond landed cost of fuel. Itbuildsup when global prices are constant, or when they
occasionally go down. The Government then uses it to compensate importers for losses which could have
been incurred intimes o f fuel price increases. Pumpprices are only adjusted when the PSF is exhausted.

                                C. MacroeconomicOutlook

21.       Projected economic growth for 2009 and 2010 continues to be highbutis
subject to significant risks.The most recent projections from the IMFand Government
are that growth will be 6.9 percent in2009 and 6.0 percent in2010. While these
projections are lower than growth rates in2007 and 2008, they are still highbased on two
assumptions. First, there i s an expectation o f higher tobacco supply response to last
year's record prices. Second, the new uraniummine that hasjust opened i s expected to
contribute 10percent to GDP. However, these growth projections are subject to downside
risks and will continuously be reassessed as the impact of the global economic crisis
becomes clearer.

22.       Inflation is expected to ease over the medium term while the international
reserve position is uncertain. There has been a significant decline inworld fuel prices
andfertilizer prices have also beencoming down. Withthe global economy slowing
down, commodity prices are likely to continue declining. As a result, the IMFand
Government are projecting inflation to be around 7.8 percent in2009 and 6.7 percent in
2010. At the same time, the international reserve position i s uncertain. First,while the
global economic slowdown i s expected to reduce the cost of Malawi's imports, it will
also have a negative impact on exports. Second, Government policy on the exchange rate
remains uncertain.

                                    D.Debt Sustainability

23.       With prudent external borrowing, sound public debt management, and
effective use of borrowed resources, Malawi's future risk of external debt distress is
expected to be moderate. As mentioned earlier, Malawi reached completion point o f
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative inAugust 2006. As a result o f
HIPC and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), external debt declinedfrom an
average (inNPV terms) of 253.3 percent o f exports in2005 to 40.9 percent in2006. As a
share o f GDP, external debt stock decreased from 143 percent in2005 to 14.3 percent in
2006. Preliminary estimates show that as o f 2007, external debt (inNPV terms) as a share
of exports hadrisento 41.6 percent, while debt stock as a percentage of GDPhad
increased to 14.5 percent. While the sensitivity analysis shows that Malawi's NPV of
debt-to-exports profile i s going to remainbelow the HIPC threshold under a number o f
shocks, it i s only so inthe event that the authorities maintain sound macroeconomic and
external borrowing policies over the medium and long term and accelerate the
implementation o f structural reforms.

24.     The Government'sprogramis set outinthe MGDS,currentlyinitssecond
year of implementation. The strategy outlines the Government's economic growth and
development priorities for the five years between 2006/07 and 2010/11. It seeks to
achieve the aspirations of Malawi as defined inVision 2020 and the Millennium
Development Goals. Further,the strategy builds on the Malawi Poverty Reduction
Strategy (2002), and integrates a number of new sector strategies, policies and emerging
issues, such as landreform, publidprivate partnerships,nutrition andHIV/AIDS. The
MGDS is organized around five themes: Sustainable Economic Growth; Social
Protection; Social Development; Infrastructure Development; and Good Governance.
Each theme specifies medium-term outcomes and strategies to achieve them. Its result
framework, however, has not yet beenunderpinnedby a comprehensive list of indicators
for monitoring and evaluation.

25.       The MGDSrecognizesthat strongandsustainableeconomicgrowthis key
to reducingpoverty. As indicatedearlier, the long-termvision of the MGDS is to make
Malawi more production andexport oriented. The strategy seeks to achieve growth rates
of at least 6 percent a year. The MGDS emphasizes agriculture as the driver of growth
inthe mediumterm. Itfocuses on increasingagriculturalproductivity andintegrating
smallholder farmers into commercial activities. Inthe long term, the Government has also
identifiedfour sectors with potential for highgrowth: tourism, mining, manufacturing,
and agro-processing. There is also emphasis on infrastructure development andthe need
to create a conducive environment for export-led growth, buildingon sound
macroeconomic andpublic expenditure management.

26.        The first annualprogressreport(APR)of the MGDSwas finalizedin2008
while the secondAPR is to befinalizedsoon. The first APR presented good to mixed
progress insome sectors, andless than satisfactory progress inothers. For example, in
agriculture, progress was found to havebeen made inimproving agriculture productivity
as a result o f the input subsidy program. However, inhealth, the APR presents mixed
progress. For example, it reports that significant progress was made insuch areas as TB
cure rate, child immunization against measles, proportion of births attended by skilled
personnel, andthe doctor population ratio. At the same time, it i s reported that the targets
set for 2006/07 were not met inthe areas o f availability o f drugs at health facilities,
nurse-populationratio, and the Government's financial contribution to the health sector.
The APR also concludes that progress inimproving the share of the private sector
investment inGDP was less than targeted, underscoringthe need for Malawi to accelerate
reforms for improving the business climate, especially since Malawi has been slippingin
the rankings under the World Bank's Doing Business Survey. Inthe area o f
infrastructure, the targets set for improving the condition of roads and reducing the share
of transport costs ininternational trade were not met. This confirms the finding of the
2007 public expenditure review (undertaken jointly with the World Bank) that
insufficient resources are allocatedto road maintenance.

27.        A Joint-Staff AdvisoryNote(JSAN)on the first APR was preparedand
submittedto the Boardsof the World BankandIMFon September 16,2008. Inthe
JSAN, staffs welcome progress made inthe implementationof the MGDS as reportedin
the APR; they note the challenges that still remain; andmake some recommendations for
improving performance. For example, inagriculture, staffs advise the authorities to
articulate a clear strategy for implementing a financially sustainable fertilizer subsidy
program since its cost has clearly become less sustainable. Inthe area o f improving the
business climate, staffs urgethe authorities to speed up completion of the process
currently underway o f streamlining the business licensing regime and creating a one stop
investment centre inorder to improve Malawi's position inthe global doing business
surveyrankings.

IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

                         A. Linksto the CountryAssistance Strategy

28.       As indicatedinthe programdocumentfor PRSC-1,the PRSCprogramis
anintegralpart of the Bank's assistance programto Malawias outlinedinthe CAS.
The current CAS for Malawi was approved inFebruary 2007 and covers a four year
period (FY07-10). The CAS i s fully aligned to the MGDS and is designed to help the
Government achieve four key outcomes: improving smallholder agricultural productivity
and integration into agro-processing; put inplace a foundation for long- termeconomic
growth through improved infrastructure and investment climate; reducing vulnerability at
the household level to HIV/AIDS and malnutrition; and sustaining improvements in
expenditure management, transparency and accountability. Inachieving these outcomes,
the CAS provides for a programmatic development lendingoperation every year over the
CAS period.

29.       The CAS providesanindicationof the rolethat theDPLsareenvisagedto
playinsupportingthe MGDS. Interms of policy areas, the CAS envisages that the
DPLwould support policy reforms that seek to reduce keyrisks to the development of
markets.Second, the DPLwould support policyreforms that create a stable and
conducive environment for private sector growth. Third, the CAS also envisages that the
DPLwould seek to support policy implementationaimed at strengthening the institutions
of public management and improving transparency and accountability. Finally, the DPL
will also seek to ensure that the policies of the Government do notjeopardize debt
sustainability.

                                 B. Coordinationwith the IMF

30.       As was the case with PRSC-1,therewill be constantcoordinationwith the
IMFatallstagesofthesecondPRSCprocess. Maintenanceof soundmacroeconomic
management will continue to be a precondition for the implementation of the PRSC
program. Therefore, staff will work closely with the IMFteam inorder to be current on
Government performance under the ESFprogram. Duringthe identificationof prior-
actions andtriggers for the PRSC program, attentionhas also been paid to the
benchmarks under the previous PRGFandthe ESFprogram to avoid cross-conditionality.

                C. CollaborationandHarmonizationwith OtherDonors

31.       The PRSCprogramcontinuesto be implementedwithinthe frameworkof
the CABS. The CABS is a group of donors that have ajoint approach to the provisionof
budgetary support to the Government o f Malawi. InSeptember 2005, the CABS group
and GoM agreed on a Joint Framework (JF) for budget support cooperationdesigned to
formalize their relationship. The JF represents a memorandum of understanding on
principles governing budget support cooperation inMalawi. Some of the principles
governing this cooperation include alignment to the country's poverty reduction strategy,
joint reviews, and predictability o f funding. The PRSC program i s IDA'Sinstrument for
the provision of budget support under the CABS framework.

32.       The CABSJointFrameworkamongother thingsprovidesfor a
PerformanceAssessment Framework(PAF) on whichto base disbursement
decisions.The PAFconsists of ajointly approved set of indicators andtargets for
assessing Government performance and progress inthe use of budget support. Each
indicator has an annual target which the Government i s expected to meet. The CABS
undertakes two annual reviews, one duringFebruary-Marchand another duringAugust-
September. Both reviews are aligned to the budget cycle. The February-March review
takes placejust before the Government starts to prepare its budget. The review focuses on
assessingGovernment performance inachieving the targets for each indicator inthe PAF.
Decisions on whether to disburse budget support and how much are based on the
outcome o f this review. The August-September review focuses on the annual budget that
will havejust been approved by Parliament, public financial management issues, and a
preliminary assessment of the fiscal performance duringthe previous fiscal year. O n a
rotating basis, one member of the CABS acts as a secretariat for the group duringthese
 semi-annual reviews.

 33.       Inthis context,the PRSCprogramisfully alignedwith the PAF. In
 particular, the PRSC policy matrix i s a subset of indicators (andtheir respectivetargets)
 contained inthe PAF. Annex 2 contains a PAFwith these indicators andtheir targets for
 2009 and 2010.

                        D.Relationshipto otherBankOperations

 34.       The PRSCprogramwill continueto complementcurrent andplanned
 BankinvestmentoperationsinMalawi. Inthis regard, the program is particularly
 linked to three projects: the Agriculture Development Program - Support Project (ADP-
 SP) which was approvedon 25 June 2008 but which is not yet effective, the Business
 Environment Strengthening Technical Assistance Project (BESTAP) approved inM a y
 2007, andthe Financial Management andTransparency Project (FIMTAP).All the three
 enable the Bank to provide technical assistance to the Government inimplementing the
 reform program supported by the PRSC.

V. THE PROPOSEDPOVERTY REDUCTIONSUPPORT GRANT

                                   A. Overall Description

35.         The proposed SecondPoverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSC-2) is the
secondina series of three annual PRSCs whose aim is to support implementation of
the Government's poverty reduction strategy, the MGDS. Itseeksto support reforms
for deepening maize and fertilizer markets; continuing improvements in the business
environment by reducing the length o f time it takes to settle commercial disputes;
addressing the vulnerability o f poor households to shocks through improved targeting of
the fertilizer subsidy program; and continuing improvements in economic governance
with a focus on reforms to improve the budget process, debt andpayroll management,
and systems of accountability inpublic financial management.

36.         The PRSC series supports a focusedset of policy reforms which can been
categorized under four components:

(1)Improvingthefunctioning ofagricultural markets. Thepurpose ofthereforms is
to improve the efficiency o f marketsthrough greater participation o f the private sector in
input and output markets, andbybringingmarkets closer to farmers,
(2) Improvingthe business climate. The program supports measures to improve the
enforcement o f commercial contracts and reduce the lengthof time for processing
business licenses.
(3) Improvingsocial protection. The program supports improvements inthe design,
targeting, implementation, and coordination o f social protection programs.
(4) Improvingeconomic governance. The program supports measures to strengthen
public financial management through improved debt and payroll management, and
financial management accountability.

37.        The three year reform programbeing supported by thePRSC program is
contained ina policy matrix presentedinAnnex 3. The preparationof the PRSC
program has been informed by several analytical studies and reviews. These studies and
reviews were outlined indetail inthe program document for PRSC-1.More recently, a
Public Sector Reviewwas completed in2007 while a Country Economic Memorandum
i s under preparation. These will further inform the process o f sharpeningexisting reforms
and designing new ones.


                                B. Development Objectives

38.         ThePRSC programaims at contributing to the achievementof Malawi's
medium-termdevelopmentobjectivesas outlinedinthe MGDS. Inparticular, it is
designed to support the Government inpursuinga development strategy that aims at
accelerating growth while at the same time ensuring that the vulnerable are adequately
protected from shocks. I t is therefore expected that at the endof the series, the program will
have contributed towards increased economic growth andpoverty reductionby supporting
implementation of policy and institutional reforms that will leadto increased agricultural

productivity, increased private sector investment, improvedhousehold resilience to shocks,
and sustainedimprovements infiscal management.

                      C. Proposed Levelof Support under PRSC-2

39.       The proposedlevel of funding for the operation is US$30million. As will
be outlined inthe subsequent section, the PRSCprogramremains broadly on track with
Governrnent having met all the eight prior actions. It i s therefore proposedthat an amount
of US$30million be disbursed, inline with the CAS.

     D.ProgressinImplementingthe ReformProgramSupportedby the PRSC

40.       Satisfactory progresshas been made inimplementing the reform program
supported by the PRSC, although policy actions insome areas risk undermining
progressmade. As will be outlined indetail below, all the prior actions agreed under
PRSC-2have beenmet. However, some of the recent policy measures, particularly in
agriculture, have the risk of undermining progress achieved inimproving the functioning
of agriculture markets and ineconomic governance-both         of which are critical areas of
the government's reformprogram supported by the PRSC. Table 4 presents a summary
of the implementation status of all the prior actions including a comparison o f the agreed
prior actions with the original triggers for PRSC-2

Improvingthe Functioning of Agriculture Markets

41.     Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for the majority of the Malawian
population. With around 85 percent of the population based inthe rural areas, farmingis
the main occupation for most households. The majority of agriculture households are
smallholder farmers, who grow crops on less thanone hectare of land. Most households
grow maize which i s the staple food. Although the crop i s grown principally for
subsistence requirements, some proportion is sold to meet income requirements. This
applies to both surplus andfood-deficit households. It i s not uncommon for food-deficit
households to sell a proportion of their maize crop at harvest time to meet their income
needs and then buy again from the market when they runout o f their own produce. Other
food crops grown for subsistence and cash requirements are rice, cassava, sorghum, and
pulses. Tobacco i s the main cash crop. Other smallholder cash crops include cotton,
groundnuts, and more recently, soya beans and paprika. Further, smallholder farmers are
also increasingly being engaged intea and sugar productionthrough contract
arrangements. Otherwise, the bulk of tea and sugar i s produced by large scale farmers.

42.     One of the major challengesfacing the agriculture sector inMalawiis its low
productivity. There is a wide gap inMalawibetween yields observed inon-farm
experimental fields and actual yields obtained by farmers. For example, while potential
yields for hybridmaize range from 5 to 8 tons per hectare, average actual yields have
been around 1.5 tons and rarely reached beyond 2.5 tons. The major contributing factor
affecting productivity inthe smallholder sector i s the low use o f fertility enhancing
inputs.Because of small landholdings, there is virtually little or no roomto let the landlie
fallow for some years or to practice crop rotation inorder to renew the fertility o f the soil.



                                             - 23 -

As aresult, improvements inyields depend solely onuse of improved seeds and
fertilizers. Unfortunately, since the majority of the households are also poor, affordability
i s a major constraint.

43.      The problem of low productivity is exacerbated by huge variability inprices,
especially inthe maize sub-sector, making the task of achieving food security even
more difficult for the Government. Malawi experiences some o f the highest seasonal
variability ingrain prices o f any country insouthern Africa. Inyears o f favorable
harvests, farm gate prices may drop prices may drop below levels necessary to cover
production costs. Such low prices discourage investment inmaize production. O nthe
other hand, inyears of drought, consumer prices can rise significantly, undermining the
capacity of manyhouseholds to purchase food, andhence contributing to increasingrates
of malnutrition. Grain prices are highly variable across seasons inMalawi because
markets are relatively thin. Only 5 to 15 percent o f the grain annually harvested flows
through the commercial market. As a result, small changes inthe quantity of grain traded
can have a large impact on market prices. Further, price movements are also prone to
speculation about levels of grain stocks inthe country.

44.      Inthis context, well functioning agricultural markets are criticalto the
welfare of households and to the growth of the sector ingeneral. Because o f low
yields, most households are unable to produce enough food to meet their requirements for
the year. It i s estimated that more than 60 percent o f agriculture households inMalawi
rely on buyingmaize from the market to meet shortfalls intheir own farmproduction.
Therefore, ready access to food markets and low food prices during the lean season
become critical for food-deficit households to meet their food requirements. Inthis
regard, the marketingsystem must be able to move grain from surplus to deficit areas on
a timely basis and at limited cost. Further, the system must also make sure that farmers
have ready access to produce markets where crops can be sold at favourable prices. This
would ensure that farmers earn reasonable incomes to cover input costs, expand
production, and meet other non-food requirements. At the same time, well functioning
markets need to minimize price variability so that a reasonable balance i s struck between
highproducer prices and low consumer prices. Lastly, inorder to increase agriculture
productivity, there i s need for input marketsto be efficient so that inputs are readily
available and prices are affordable.

Improvedfunctioning of outputmarkets

45.          Government's policy on improving the functioning of output markets has
since the 1960s centered on the operations of the national marketing board, namely
the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC). For a long
time, the Government ensured that ADMARC had a vast network of markets inthe
country. It was the only authorized formal sector player insmallholder input and output
markets,until 1987when agricultural marketing was liberalized to allow private sector
participation. Over the years, ADMARC has become synonymous with financial and
operational mismanagement rather thanfocusing on the provision of ready markets in
rural remote areas shunned by private traders due to hightransport costs and low
volumes. Further, its subsidized operations have hindered the growth of private trading


                                             - 24 -

inurbanandsemi-urban areas. Infact, althoughADMARC's mandate was to facilitate
agricultural marketing inremote areas, ADMARC has been operating everywhere,
including inurbanareas where the private sector traders are prevalent. Inaddition,
ADMARC has also been involved inother non-core mandates. For example, through
AIHC, the institutionhad acquired shares invarious companies, some of which were not
inthe agriculturebusiness.

46.         Oneofthe keyPRSCsupportedreformprogramshasthereforebeena
strategicrefocusingof ADMARC's operations.Inthis context, ADMARC has started
streamlining its various activities, inline with the restructuring programthat was
approved by Cabinet in2006. First, ADMARC has closed departments (e.g. clinics,
tailoring workshops, e.t.c.) that have been providing ancillary services that are not core to
its operations. These services are now being contracted out to the private sector. Second,
ADMARC has sold all the shares it used to hold invarious subsidiary companies, and
closed down AIHC.

47.       Another criticalreformis the establishmentof the MalawiAgricultural
WarehousingandTradingCompany (MAWTCO)withthe objectiveof enhancing
privatesector participationinmaizemarkets.MAWTCOwasformally established on
April 9, 2009 with six warehouses initially transferred from ADMARC to MAWTCO
(PRSC-2prior action). It will operate as a warehouse leasing company to provide
reliable, efficient and well-maintained storage facilities. MAWTCO will also be usedfor
the development of a warehouse receipt system (WRS). Under a WRS, producers or
traders deposit finished agriculture products ina secure warehouse where they receive a
receipt certifying the deposit of goods o f a particular quantity, quality, and grade. By
using the stock ina WRS as collateral, private traders will be able to access financial
credit from lendinginstitutions. The establishment of MAWTCO will therefore represent
a significant milestone inthe restructuring process o f ADMARC inthat it will help
deepen markets by promoting the participation of private traders inoutput markets
through access to good storage facilities andfinancial capital from lending institutions.

48.       Goingforward,the Governmenthasprepareda policyframeworkfor
strengtheningmaizemarkets. This was inresponse to concerns raisedfollowingthe
imposition of a banon private sector maize traders inAugust 2008. The framework
document outlines the policy instruments that Government will employ intackling
various policy issues inmaize markets once the bani s lifted. The main elements o f the
policy framework have beenreflected inthe Letter of Development Policypresented in
Annex 1.

      BOX 1:COSTS AND BENEFITSOF REPOAND CALL OPTION CONTRACTS

REPO Contract

A REPO deal is a trade finance contract which helps minimize the costs and risks of holding grain stocks in the
country.Throughthis agreement, Government pays the private sector a premiumto assure the first right of repurchase
of the maize held in the country. The private sector buys the maize from farmers at a stipulated price and then takes
responsibility for storage, financing, and collateral management of stocks within the country until the lean season.
Should the country need additional grain to meet domestic requirements, the government can repurchase stocks at a
future date during the lean season. The main cost of the REPO is the premium, which is forfeited should the
Governmentnot exercisethe option to buy the back the grain. The benefits of the strategy far outweigh the costs and
andincludethe following:
    The REPO creates asecond layer of grain stocksto complement the strategic grain reserves heldby the NFRA.
    REPO stocksare managedand financedby the privatesector andassuredto be ingoodcondition..
    A REPO deal helps alleviate the Government's cash flow problems since the Government does not immediately
    needto raisehuge financial resourcesto maintaingrain stocks.
    Since aREPO deal providesadditionaldemandand stipulates an initial purchaseprice from farmers, it helpsto
    preventproducer pricesfrom droppingsignificantly at harvest time. Insteadof imposingaminimum price at atime
    when excess supplyof grainwill depressproducer prices, aREPOdeal producesanegotiatedfloor priceat which
    grainwill beboughtfrom farmers andthis pricecan bepublicized.
    Since aREPO deal stipulatesarepurchaseprice, it helpsto containthe rise inconsumerprices during the lean
    season.
    A REPOdeal also helpsto deepen marketsby promotingprivatesector investment inmaizetradingand storage.
    Ifthe countryis assuredof adequate stocksfor its own requirementsprovidedby strategic grainreserves,
    complementedby aREPOdeal, it can comfortablyencourageexports to take advantageof regionalgrain demand.
    This would contributeto foreign exchangeearnings as well as strengtheningof producer prices.
    Further,it ensures a more transparentpolicy environmentfor the privatesector becausethe Government announces
    publicly the size of the REPO deal, the price at which maize will be repurchased, and the expiry date of the
    repurchaseoption. Such information signals to private traders the parameters of the Government's food security
    policy. This transparency is useful for privatesector investment, trading, andoperationaldecisions.
    Without aREPOdeal, the Government would needto import grain should additionalstocks be requiredduring the
    lean season. This mayberisky, expensive, andlogistically not efficient if there i s aregion-wideshortage of grain.

CallOptionContract

A call optioncontract is an instrument which helps minimize thecostsandrisksof food shortages. The Government
pays apremiumto aprivatetradingcompany or abank) for the right but not the obligationto import maize at afuture
date and at apre-agreedprice.. The main ideaof acall option contract is to lock inthe import priceand supply contract
for grainwhenthere is concernthat the country mayneedto import.. Just like under aREPO contract, the maincost of
acall optioncontract is the premiumwhich is forfeited should the Government not exercisethe call option. Otherwise
there are anumberof benefitsassociatedwith acall option contract.
    Ifputinplaceprior to ashortage, acall optioncontractcanhelpensurethat thecountry is well coveredfor the lean
    season..,
    By locking inthe import price, acall option contract helps to reducethe cost of importing grain.This benefitis
    significantinayear when there are regionwide food shortages. During the draught year of 2005, Malawi
    purchasedacall optionbasedon the SouthAfrican SAFEX commodityexchangeto helpcap the cost of imports.
    Dueto rising grainprices, Malawi is estimatedto havesavedUS$70per ton of maizeimported.
    Since maize is purchasedat a stipulatedprice, like aREPOdeal, a call option contract helps to containrises in
    consumer pricesduringthe lean season.
    A call optioncontract also ensures amoretransparent policy environmentfor the privatesector since the
    Governmentcan makepublic the parametersof the contract. Information about the Government's strategy is useful
    for investment,trading, andoperationaldecisionsof the privatesector.

49.       Withinthe policyframework for maizemarkets, Governmentplansto
prioritizepricehedginginstrumentsin dealingwith pricevariabilityover direct
interventions.The first of these is the repurchase option (REPO) agreement under which
the private sector agrees to hold stocks inthe country untilthe Government i s able to
establish that they are no longer needed. The second type o f hedging instruments to be
employed i s a physical call option, which i s used to lock inthe import price of grain
when there is domestic shortage. Greater public transparency that characterizes these
contracts will help improve the policy environment within which the private sector makes
investment and operational decisions intrading activities (see Box 1).The
implementation of a REPO or call option as necessary will therefore be a trigger for
PRSC-3.

Improvedfunctioning of input markets

50.          Onthe inputmarketingside, attentionhasbeenon implementingthe
inputsubsidy programina manner that doesnot disrupt commercialmarketing
channels.The input subsidyprogram was established duringthe 2005/06 agriculture
season, andi s aimed at assisting poor households to access inputsfor increased
productivity. Inthe first year o f implementation, maize andtobacco growing
beneficiaries were guaranteed a significantly reducedprice o f K950 per 50kg bag o f
CANfertilizer, equivalent to a 70 percent subsidy at prevailing market price.6

51.     Sinceitsinception,the fertilizer subsidy programhashada significant
positiveimpactonfood security.Complemented by favorable rainfall conditions,
Malawi has registered surplus national maize production since 2006, even managing to
export some o f the surplus grain in2007. An evaluation o f the subsidy program carried
out by a consortium o f DFIDfunded consultants during2007-08 found that the program
has had a significant positive impact on food security inMalawi. For example, it found
that the proportion o f households reporting a major shock from highfood prices between
2004 and 2007 decreased from 79 percent to 20 percent, largely because of higher maize
yields on account of improved access to the subsidy program. A preliminary analysis of
the benefit-cost ratio o f the program conductedby the same consultants in2009 shows
that since its inception, the benefit-cost ratio has been greater thanone, under high as
well as medium scenarios o f maize yield response to fertilizer.

52.          However, therehave also beenconcernssurroundingthe program. First,
the cost o f the programhas been increasing every year. When it started in2005/06, the
program cost only $70 million, or 1.7 percent of GDP. However duringthe 2008/09
agricultural season, it i s estimated that the program will cost $209 million or 4.7 percent
of GDP. There i s therefore a concernthat the program i s not sustainable at the current
level, although this will partially be mitigated by the decline infertilizer prices that took
place after the global financial crisis. Second, there has been concernthat the program's
targeting systemhas faced challenges, with some relatively better off households


 0134.76 prohibits the Bank from supporting tobacco related activities except incases where the crop
accounts for more than 10percent of exports and where the beneficiaries are primarily the poor. Inthe case
of Malawi, both criteria were met and as a result an exception to OP4.76 was granted.


                                                   - 27 -

receiving coupons at the expense of poorer households. Third, while private traders were
initially included inthe redemption o f coupons, the 2008/09 program only used the two
parastatal organizations, ADMARC andthe Smallholder Farmers Fertilizer Revolving
Fundof Malawi (SFFRFM). There is concern that this will reduce commercial sales of
inputsto smallholder farmers through private sector outlets, threatening their existence.

53.          Althoughdialoguehassometimesbeendifficult,the Bankwill continueto
beengagedinorder to helpimprovethe program.Inthis context, the Bankis
currently finalizing a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) that i s re-looking at the
fertilizer subsidy program. The findings and recommendations will therefore help inform
the dialogue. Further, the PRSC program will under various pillars continue to support
actions that Government i s committed to undertaking inorder to address challenges
currently being faced.

54.          Inorder to ensurethat implementationof the subsidyprogrampromotes
the functioningofinputmarkets,Governmentplansto developa strategyfor input
marketdevelopment.The strategy will spell out aframework for ensuring cheap and
affordable inputs for farmers, and will outline the role to be playedby various players. As
part of this process, the Government has undertaken apellformance assessment to
evaluatepublic andprivate sector involvement in wholesale and retail trade of subsidized
fertilizer, based onfour indicators: quality of product sold, quality of serviceprovided,
additional sewices ofsered, and other related issues (PRSC-2prior action). The
assessment found no significant differences betweenpublic and private sector operations
inredeemingfertilizer coupons underthe inputsubsidyprogram. Itis expected that the
input development strategy will contain a detailed actionplanto bedevelopedin
consultation with various stakeholders. Therefore publication of medium-term action plan
for input market development (to be agreed with fertilizer and seed associations) will be a
trigger for PRSC-3.

Improvingthe BusinessClimate

55.          The MGDShighlightsthe importanceof the privatesector asanengine of
growthinMalawi. Inthis regard, one of the sub-themes inthe strategy is that of creating
an enabling environment for private sector-led growth. As pointed out earlier, the I C A
andDoingBusiness Surveys have highlighted the various constraints to private sector
development inMalawi, one o f which has been an unstable macroeconomic environment.
Followingprogress inrestoring macroeconomic stability, the Government i s now
focusing on a broadprogram o f `second generation' reforms inthe domestic business
environment which will seek to stimulate private sector investment and employment
creation.

Reduced timesfor settling commercialdisputes

56.          One of the keyprivatesector concernswith Malawi'sbusinessclimate
hasbeenthe lengthof time it takes to settlecommercialdisputes.The court system
has been faced with capacity challenges indealing with commercial cases, partly due to
the absence o f specialized courts. Priority inthe general courts is usually given to


                                             - 28 -

criminal andpolitical cases. In2006, it took an average o f 337 days to enforce a contract
through the court system. Some businesses have therefore beenreluctant to enter into
contract arrangements except with the most trusted clients thereby limiting the scope for
business opportunities and growth. For example, most small scale firms have generally
found it difficult to access commercial bank credit.

57.          Recently, the length of time it takesto settle commercial disputes has been
reduced (PRSC-2 prior action). InMay 2007, a Commercial Division of the HighCourt
was established. Fourjudges were appointed, and the court has been operational. As o f
March2008, it was taking on average 125 days to settle commercial disputes, which i s
significantly below the target o f 290 days for 2008. Preliminary estimates indicate that as
of January 2009, the average had gone down further to 120 days.

58.          So far, the Commercial Court has only been hearing new cases. Therefore,
the Government's focus now i s on dealing with the backlog o f commercial cases that are
still at the General Divisiono f the High Court. A case audit has been completed to
determine which cases should be transferred to the Commercial Court (PRSC-3 trigger).
The process i s being supported by the World Bank's Business Environment Support for
Technical assistance project (BESTAP).

59.          Beyond improving the length of time it takes to settle commercial
disputes, the Government also plansto reduce the time it takes to process business
licenses. Inthis regard, a revised Malawi Investment andTrade Center (MITC) bill has
been submittedto parliament and gazetted (PRSC-3 trigger). The bill provides for the
creation of a one-stop shop for processing business licenses.

ImprovingSocial Protection

60.          Most households inMalawi are vulnerable and experience various types
of shocks. Examples o f vulnerabilities include illnesses and deaths o f relations, mostly
due to HIV/AIDS, drought related crop failures, and unaffordable food and input prices.
Households are often forced to draw down on their savings or sell their assets inorder to
cope with shocks and vulnerabilities. Insome cases, households have to re-allocatetime
resources away from their traditional economic activities to either care for household
members or mobilize income and food inorder to survive. Shocks tend to drive the poor
into even deeper poverty.

61.          Inorder to help the poor cope, a number of social protection programs
are beingimplemented across the country. The programs are being runby various
institutions, including Government, development partners, and non-governmental
organizations. Some are designed to provide the vulnerable or affected households
directly with their needs while others aim at empowering them so that they are able to
undertake productive income earning activities.

62.          To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of various social protection
programs, cabinet is discussing a comprehensive social protection policy. To date,
social protection programs have been poorly coordinated, resulting inoverlapping


                                             - 29 -

geographical coverage and insome cases conflicting approaches. The mainreason for
poor coordination has been lack of leadership at Government level. First,although a
Social ProtectionUnit (SPU) was established to coordinate and oversee implementation
of social protection programs, its capacity has beenweak, mainly because of low staffing
levels. However some progress has recently beenmade, with the recruitment of
additional staff inthe unit. Second, coordination efforts have beenhampered by lack o f a
guidingpolicy. Inthis regard, a comprehensive social protection policy was developed
and is being discussed by cabinet. The policy was developed after extensive consultation
with all the relevant stakeholders.

63.         The most importantsocialprotectionprogramin Governmentis the
fertilizer subsidy program.As described earlier, the programwas established duringthe
2005/06 agricultural seasonwith the aim of improving food security for poor households
through access to fertilizer. The program targets around 1.5 million maize andabout
200,000 tobacco farmers every year. Each eligible farmer is provided with two coupons
which are used to buy fertilizer at a subsidized price.

Improved targetingof thefertilizer subsidy program

64.         A major challengeinthe implementationof the fertilizer subsidy
programhasbeenthe targeting of beneficiaries.Inits conception, the programwas
intendedfor very poor smallholder farmers to be identified by local leaders. Inpractice,
the process o f identifying the beneficiaries has proved to be a challenging one, with
concerns raisedthat some better off households have benefited at the expense o f the poor.

65.         Althoughchallengesremain,effortshavebeenmadeto ensure that only
eligiblehouseholdsbenefitfromthe program. Inaneffort to improve the effectiveness
of the program, Government has been working on improving the program's targeting
mechanism. For the 2008/09 season, improved guidelines for targeting have been
introduced and are now under implementation (PRSC-2prior action). Inparticular,
targeting this year has beenmore transparent than inprevious years. While inthe past,
identification of the beneficiaries was done by the local leaders only, this year, other
community leaders have been involved. Further, the list o f beneficiaries has had to be
confirmed by members o f the community at public meetings specifically called for this
purpose. Looking forward, Government i s committed to makingfurther improvements on
the targeting o f the program. To that end, it plansto publishrevised guidelines for
identification o f beneficiaries based on field experiences from implementing the 2008/09
program. (PRSC-3trigger).

Improving;EconomicGovernance

66.         ThePEFA assessments conductedin2005 and2006 indicatedthat despite
recentprogress,challengesstillremaininvarious areas such as budgetprocess,
payrollanddebt management,andexternalaudit. Specifically, the 2006 PEFA
highlighted concerns over the lack o f linkage between the Government's Strategic Plan
(the MGDS) and the financial planningandbudgeting systems, the need to fully integrate
the personnel andpayroll systems inIFMIS, andthe weak parliamentary oversight and



                                             - 30 -

external accountability of the Executive. Inaddition, weaknesses indebt management
systemwere also highlightedby the 2004 HIPC AAP andthe 2007 PER. Basedon the
findings of these reports, the Government has prepared a Public Finance andEconomic
Management (PFEM)Action Plan, which includes the key reforms supported by the
PRSC program. The Bank, inclose collaboration with the IMFand the other
development partners, i s strongly supporting the implementation of the PFMaction plan
through the restructured FIMTAPproject, with a focus on strengthening the IFMIS,
payroll management, procurement, accounting, and auditing (internal and external).

Improvedpayroll management

67.       Weaknessesinthe management of the payrollhave been a major
contributing factor to poor fiscal management inthe past. Difficulties have beendue
to several factors, including a complex remunerationpolicy where as much as two-thirds
of the take home pay was inthe form of allowances, the lack of a credible integrated
system of managing personnel andpayroll records, and the fact that it takes longperiods
o f time for personnel records (and hence payroll) to be updatedwhenever life events such
as deaths or resignations occur.

68.       Significant reforms have been taken by the Government to strengthen
control of the payrollinrecent years. A civil service wage reform was carried out in
late 2004, which entailed a rationalization of grades and salary levels, and a consolidation
of most non-discretionary allowances into the wage. The Government also introduced in
2006 a new systemfor managing personnel andpay roll records, the HumanResource
Management Information System (HRMIS), which ensures that payroll data is
automatically updated each time there i s a change to personnel data. A database of all
Government employees was compiled in2006 and reconciled with payrollrecords.

69.       Most recently, an HRMIS review and apersonnel audit havejust been
undertaken (PRSC-2prior action). The purpose of the HRMIS review was to test the
system's integrity for personnel and payroll data management. The expectation is that a
robust personnel and payroll management system will help improve management and
mitigate problems of ghost workers, inaccurate wage projections, unauthorized
allowances, recruitments, promotions, and wage increases. The personnel audit covered
the whole public service. Duringthe exercise, the existence o f each individual staff on the
personnel database was physically verified.

70.       For improvements inpayroll management to be realized, there is need for
the implementation of recommendations from the H R M I S review and the personnel
audit. Inthis regard, an action planwill be developedfor implementing
recommendations from the HRMIS review andthe personnel audit. A realistic list of
actions will be identified from the action plan.Therefore, having an agreed action plan
from the HRMIS review and personnel audit will be a trigger for PRSC-3.

Improved coverage and timelinessin auditing of government accounts




                                           - 31 -

71.       Improvingthe coverageandtimelinessinexternalauditinghasbeenakey
objectiveof the publicfinancemanagementreformprogram.Due to limitedhuman
capacity, very few Ministries andDepartments are audited ina year. Second, preparation
of the audit reports and their submission to Parliament has taken place with long delays,
usually up to several years. Third, there i s usually no follow up on audit
recommendations made by the Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee of
Parliament.

72.       Progresshasbeenmadeto improvecoverageandtimelinessof Audits. First,
the capacity of the National Audit Office has been strengthened by the recruitment in
2007 of 60 new assistant auditors and 20 interns. This has helped increase the coverage of
external audit. As a result, for fiscal year 2004/05 (backlog), Government entities
representing more than 50 percent o f expenditures were audited. The figure i s expected to
increase further inthe next few years. Second, delays inthe submissionto the National
Audit Office of financial statements bythe Accountant Generalhave contributedto
delays inthe preparation and submission to Parliament o f Audit Reports. However, since
the roll out of IFMIS in2005, there has been significant improvement inthe preparation
of accounts at the end of the financial year. For example, the financial statements for the
2007/08 fiscal year were submittedto the Auditor General towards the end of November,
which i s only one month after the statutory requirement of within four months from the
end of the fiscal year.

73.       With increasedstaffinglevels, andthe appointmentof an Auditor General,
the.NationalAudit Officehasbeenworkingonclearingthe backloginthe
submissionof auditreports.The delayedAudit Reports for 2004/05 and2005/06 have
been submitted to Parliament (PRSC-2prior action). The financial statements for
2006/07 are currently being audited and therefore also expected to be submitted soon.
With the financial statements for 2007/08 havingbeensubmitted ontime, the auditing
process is soon to become up to date. The long delay insubmittingthe 2004/05 and
200906 audit reports has beendue to the absence for a long time, of a substantive
Auditor General who i s the only authority mandated by law to sign off on Audit Reports
before they can be submittedto the legislature. The delay infilling this position was itself
due to political wrangles inParliament. Inthe heat o f a political impasse, the opposition
dominated parliament had rejected the first candidate that the President had nominated. In
the end, the executivehad to wait for an opportune time before an alternative candidate
was presented, who was subsequently confirmed inJuly, 2008.

74.        The focus of PRSC-3inrelationto externalaudit will be onfollow-up
actionsto issuesraisedby the PublicAccounts Committee.Apart from improvements
intimely production and submission of audit reports, another areaof concern hasbeen
follow-up actions on the reports. Inthe past, external audit reports were produced and
submittedto Parliament, but nothingwouldhappen. Inparticular, the Public Accounts
Committee of Parliament would not meet to discuss the audit reports because o f lack of
funding. However, there has beennoticeableprogress inrecent times. Fundinghas been
made available for the Public Accounts Committee to discuss audit reports, and
concerned controlling officers and other public officers have been summoned to appear
before the committee. However, there is still room for improvement with regardto


                                              - 32 -

follow-up on such hearings. Inparticular, after the public officers have appeared before
the PAC, there have been some outstanding issues requiring follow up by the executive.
Responses to such queries are contained ina report known as the Treasury Minute which
i s prepared by the Secretary to the Treasury (ST). Before preparing the report, the ST will
have written all the concerned controlling officers to provide responses on the issues
raised by the PAC. Unfortunately, these Treasury Minutes have not been issued on a
regular basis. Inthis regard, a trigger for PRSC-3 will be progress on follow-up o f audit
queries through the submission o f a Treasury Minute to the Public Accounts Committee
of Parliament containing responses to issues raisedby the committee.

75.       It is expectedthat by the end of the programperiod, significant progress
will have beenmade inthe public finance accountability cycle -financial statements
and audit reports will be prepared and submitted ina timely manner, andthere will be
follow-up on issues raisedfrom audit reports.

Improved debt management

76.       There has been noticeable progressinimproving debt management
capacity within Government. After reachingthe HIPC completion point inAugust
2006, the Government's attention shifted to undertakingmeasures that would prevent
another unsustainable buildup o f external debt. A Government Debt Management
Performance assessment was undertakenin2007. Further,the 2007 PERundertaken
jointly by the G o M andthe World Bank (and which benefited from the findings of a D S A
mission inearly 2006) also looked at Malawi's debt management policy and institutional
framework. Both assessments found that the overall framework for debt management is
sound, although some weaknesses remain. Subsequently, a Debt Management Policy was
developedand approved by Cabinet(PRSC-2prior action). Among other things, the
policy commits Government to annual borrowing limits at concessional terms. The Debt
andAid Division (DAD)inthe Ministry of Finance is now also able to undertakeits own
debt sustainability analysis, although the quality o f the analysis can be improved.

77.       Going forward, coordination between debt management institutions need
to be strengthened. Notably, there appears to be no systematic reporting of information
betweenthe agents dealing with debt and cash management. For this reason, the
Government has established a Debt Coordination Committee composed o f
representatives o f the RBM, the Treasury, and the Accountant General's Office. Having
this committee operational i s a proposed trigger for PRSC-3.

Improved budgetprocess

78.       A key element of improved economicgovernance inMalawihas been
improving the linkage betweenthe MGDS (Malawi's PRSP), and the budget. The
weak linkage between the budget and the MGDS has been due to many factors. First,
guidelines on how to actually budget according to the MGDS priorities have been
unclear. Second, there has been no comprehensive budgetclassification structure that
could facilitate the link betweenthe MGDS priorities and the budget, at least at a more
dis-aggregated sector level. Third, the MGDS annual progress review i s currently not



                                            - 33 -

properly linked to the budget process. Ideally, the MGDS annual progress reviews should
be fully integrated into the budget calendar. Further, lack of timely provision of
allocation ceilings to line ministries and departments has left little time for them to
prepare their budgets inline with MGDS priorities. Lastly, the budget vetting system
itself i s weak. The Ministry o f Economic Planningand Development (MEPD) that i s
responsible for the preparation andmonitoring o f the MGDS has not taken an active role
invetting the budget submissions.

79.        Governmenthasrecentlytaken several stepsto improvethe linkage
betweentheMGDSandthe budget,althoughchallengesstillremain.The Treasury
has prepared and issued more comprehensive guidelines for line ministries on how to
budget according to the MGDS priorities. The guidelines have been communicatedto
stakeholders through workshops andbooklets. Further, a budget calendar that
incorporatesall budget related activities has been introduced (PRSC-2prior action). As
a result, for the 2008/09 budgetprocess, allocation ceilings were determined early and
communicated ingood time to line ministries and departments. This gave line ministries
and departments enough time to prepare their budgets inline with MGDS priorities.
However, for the budget to be more aligned to the MGDS at activity level, there is need
for a revised structure o f budget classification andthe associated Chart of Accounts
(COA) to be inplace. This will therefore be a trigger for PRSC-3.

80.       Weaknessesobservedinthe procurementof additionalfertilizer duringthe
2008/09 season pointto the needfor further reformsinimprovingthe budget
process.As mentioned inanearlier sectionof this document, towards the end of 2008,
the Government decidedto expand the subsidyprogram by 45 percent involume terms
without fundingbeing assured. Under pressure to have the fertilizer delivered before the
end o f the plantingseason, the procurement o f the additional fertilizer was fast-tracked by
the line ministry, appearing to bypass the control mechanisms of the Ministry o f Finance.
This development has highlightedthe fact that beyond linkingthe MGDS to the budget,
there i s need to strengthen institutional arrangements for budget implementation. As
indicated inthe Letter o f Development Policy, Government plans to introduce
strengthened procurement procedures. The Office o f the Director of Public Procurement
will only approve large procurements unless there is confirmation from the Ministryof
Finance that funds are available. Further, inorder to ensure that all the key shortcomings
are adequately addressed, Government plans to undertake a procurement audit of the
2008/09 fertilizer subsidy program and implement its key recommendations.
Implementation of this action will therefore be another trigger for PRSC-3.

    E.AgreedListofPRSC-2Prior ActionsandProposedTriggers for PRSC-3

81.      Inlight of progressoutlined above, the following is a summary of PRSC-2
prior actionsthat have beenmet:

   a MAWTCO was incorporated as a subsidiaryo f ADMARC on April 9,2009 and
     initially six warehouses were transferred.
   a A performanceassessment of private sector involvement inwholesale andretail
     trade of subsidized fertilizer has been conducted based on agreed performance
     indicators.
   a The average number of days to settle commercial disputes was 125 days as of
     March2008 and 120 days as o f January 2009, which i s less that the target o f 290.
   a A Budget calendar incorporatingallbudget related activities has beenintroduced.
   a The HRMIS review and a Personnel Audit of the civil service were undertaken in
     2008.
   a There has been improved timeliness inthe submission o f audit reports with the
      delayed Audit report on FY 05/06 submitted to Parliament.
   a A Debt andAid Managementpolicy was approvedby Cabinet onMarch 19,2009.
   a New guidelines to improve targeting of the fertilizer subsidy program to poorer
     households were implementedduringthe 2008/09 agriculture season.

82.       The proposedtriggers for PRSC-3 are meant to consolidateprogressmade
to date as well as deal with weaknesses that still remain invarious components of
the PRSC program. Insummary, the proposed PRSC-3 triggers agreed with the
authorities are as follows:

   a  Maize grain REP0 deal or call option i s implementedto improve predictability o f
     maize markets and complement physical storage o f maize stocks
   a Medium-term action planfor input market development i s drafted inconsultation
      with fertilizer andseed associations, and published.
   a  Completion of audit of cases that are still at the General Divisiono f the HighCourt
      to determine which cases should be transferred to the Commercial Court
   a  Malawi Investment andTrade Center (MITC) Bill i s gazetted
   a The revisedstructure of the budget classification andthe associated "Chart of
     Accounts (COA)" i s completed
   a Action Plansto address weaknesses identified inthe HRMIS review andpersonnel
      audit are developed
   a  Follow-up on audit queries through the issuance o f a Treasury Minute which
      contains responses to issues raisedby the Public Accounts Committee
   a  Debt Coordination Committee i s operational
   a  Publishrevisedguidelines for identification ofbeneficiaries based onfield
      experiences from 2008/09

                         F.Progress towards end-series outcomes

83.        Progresstowards achieving end of series outcomes is mixed (See Annex 6).
Inagriculture, the programhas already surpassedthe target onincreasedmaize
productivity. Mid-way through the series, the mid-point average maize productivity has
increased from 1.45 metric tons per hectare to 1.78 metric tons against an end of series
target o f 1.6 metric tons. With regard to improving the business climate, although
progress has beenmade incarrying out reform actions, progress towards the end-program
outcomes has not yet been observed. The number o f businesses startingup per month
remains at 60, below the end o f program target o f 70. Under social protection, progress
has been made towards improving the targeting o f the fertilizer subsidyprogram to poor
households. Qualitative information from independent monitoring reports show that more
poor households are benefiting from the program. Finally, within economic governance,
progress has beenmade towards reducing the ratio o f domestic debt to GDP, although the
end-program outcome may not be achieved. The ratio of domestic debt to GDPhas
reduced from 20 percent in2005/06 to 17.1percent in2007/08.

84.        Prospectsfor achieving end of series outcomes will depend on progress in
the reform programbut could also be affected by other interveningfactors. The
PRSC supported program focuses on policy and institutional actions that are critical to
achieving the identified end of series outcomes. Efforts will therefore be focused on
supporting Government inthe implementation o f the reform program. However, even if
significant progress were to be made inthe implementation of the PRSC supported
reform program, prospects for achieving the end o f series targets that have been set
would be subject to other intervening factors that may be outside the control of the PRSC
framework.

BOX 2: THE PROPOSEDPRSCAND GOODPRACTICEPRINCIPLESONCONDITIONALITY

Principle 1:ReinforceOwnership

The proposed PRSC has beenprepared after consulting Government ministries and departments on specific
reformprograms that will be implemented inorder to achieve the medium-term goals as outlined inthe
MGDS. It is out of these reform programs that prior actions and triggers to be supportedby the PRSC have
been selected. Together with donors who belong to the CABS, the specific policy and institutional changes
have beentranslated into indicators and targets and are presented inthe PAF.

Principle2: Agree upfront with the Governmentand other financialpartnersona coordinated
accountabilityframework

The CABS donors and the Government of Malawi have signed a Joint Framework (JF)o f budget support
cooperation. One of the principles contained inthe JF i s that of carrying outjoint reviews. Every year one
of the reviews focuses on assessing Government performance inmeeting the targets contained inthe PAF.
Disbursements of budgetary support are based on a positive outcome of this review.

Principle3: Customizethe accountabilityframeworkandmodalitiesofBank supportto country
circumstances

The CABS undertakes biannual reviews, one duringFebruary-March and another during August-
September. Bothreviews are aligned to the country's budget cycle. The February-March review takes place
just before the Government starts to prepare its budget. The review focuses on assessingGovernment
performance inachieving the targets for each indicator inthe PAF. Decisions on whether to disburse
budget support andhow much are based on the outcome of this review. The August-September review
focuses on the annual budget that will havejust been approved by Parliament, public financial management
issues, and a preliminary assessmentof the fiscal performance during the previous fiscal year.

Principle4: Choose only actions criticalfor achievingresultsas conditions for disbursement

One of the principles of the Joint Framework o f budget support cooperationis to have as few indicators in
the PAFas possible. Malawi's PAFhas one of the least number o f PAF indicators inthe region. The
triggers and actions for the proposedPRSC represent only those actions that will be critical for achieving
the program's project development objectives and the various outcomes.

Principle5: Conducttransparent progressreviews conducive to predictableandperformance-based
financialsupport

Inorder to improvepredictability ofbudgetary support from donors, the JFrequires donors to indicate
levels o f budgetary support that they are planning to disburse well inadvance of the start o f the fiscal year,
such that the amounts canbe included inthe Budget submitted to Parliament. Once the main annual PAF
review inFebruary-March has been concluded, all the CABS donors inMalawi indicate to the Government
how much they're planning to disburse inthe following fiscal year. The Government uses this information
during the budget preparation process.

evaluation, fiduciary aspects, and auditing; as well as environmental, poverty and
socialaspects) are the same as describedinthe program document for PRSC-1.

PRSC fall within the framework of the CABS. On the Government side, the CABS
group i s served by a secretariat which i s situated inthe Debt and Aid Divisionof the
Ministry of Finance. The secretariat coordinates preparation of the PAF, implementation,
assessmentandrevision. For these activities, the secretariat mobilizes the relevant people
invarious ministries anddepartments. These areorganized into thematic groups basedon
the areas coveredby the PAF.

87.          The programwill be monitored and evaluated through the CABS review
cycle. As mentioned earlier, the CABS group undertakes two annual reviews, one during
February-March and another duringAugust-September. Apart from looking at the annual
budget that will havejust been approved by Parliament, the August-September review
also undertakes a preliminary assessment of the progress made and likelihood of meeting
the targets inthe PAF.The February-March review then undertakes a comprehensive
assessmento f performance against the targets, and the findings o f the assessment provide
a basis for makingdisbursement decisions.

88.          The generalM&Esystem hasimproved inrecent years although
weaknessesremain. MonitoringandEvaluationof the MGDS i s coordinatedby the
M&EDivisioninthe Ministry of Economic PlanningandDevelopment. An M&Emaster
plan and road map to its implementation were approved in2005. Implementation of the
road map i s being supported by ajoint program of support with basket funding from the
European Commission, DFID, and UNDP.Under the program, M&Eofficers have been
recruited, trained and deployed inall the district assemblies o f the country. This will
improve collection of data from the field for monitoring the MGDS. M&E divisions have
also been established inmost line ministries, andeconomists will also be deployed inall
line ministries to be responsible for monitoring implementation o f the MGDS intheir
respective ministries. The mainweakness remaining i s that the indicators currently
identifiedfor monitoring the implementationof the MGDS are not comprehensive
enough for the M&E systemto provide data that could also be used for assessingthe
indicators inthe PAF. As such, data on some of the indicators still has to be collected on
an adhoc basis. The CABS partners are working with the Government to addressthis
weakness.

89.          Progressagainst PRSC targets is being monitored using two framework
matrices. The first is Table 4 which is usedto monitor progress on the reformprogram
itself i.e. whether or not Government has met the prior actions for a particular operation


                                               40

andhow the reform program i s evolving. The second is Annex 6 which i s used for
monitoring progress against end-program outcomes. Annex 6 contains the monitoring
indicators, their baseline values, end-programtargets, and progress inthe intermediate
period.


                                    B. FiduciaryAspects

90.         While weaknesses remain, overall, the team is satisfied that the public
finance management system inMalawi is satisfactory to support this operation.

PublicFinancialManagement System

91.         Three Public Expenditure and FinancialAccountability (PEFA)
assessmentshave been conductedinrecent years, in2005,2006, and 2008. The 2008
assessment found that a number of improvements have been made since the 2006
assessment. Selected areas where improvementshave been made include transparency of
inter-governmental fiscal relations, oversight of fiscal risk from other public sector
entities, recording andmanagement of cash balances, debt and guarantees, effectiveness
of internal audit, quality and timeliness o f annual financial statements, and legislative
scrutiny of the annual budgetlaw. The assessment reported that regardless of progress
being made, weaknesses remain inexternal auditing, particularly, timely submission of
audit reports to Parliament andfollow-up, effectiveness o f payroll controls, and public
access to key fiscal information.

92.         Since the assessment was done, progresshas beenmade ina number of
areas. First, as discussed inthe section on progress under the PRSC-supportedreform
program, Government has taken steps to clear the audit backlog and i s on course to being
current soon. Second, again as reportedearlier, since the assessmentwas done (in
February), the Government undertaken an HRMIS review and a payroll audit.
Implementation o f recommendations from these exercises will help improve management
o f the payroll. Lastly, the Government i s planningto have a more organized and
coordinated approach to improving PFM.Inthis regard, a dedicated unitto coordinate
implementation o f the Public Finance and Economic Management reform agenda has
been created within the Ministry of Finance, and i s already operational. Further, with
support from development partners, particularly those that are providing budget support,
the PFEMunit is now working on a road map for developing a PFEMprogram that will
be supported ina more coordinate manner. Inthe interim, an existingPFEMaction plan
i s being updated to take into account some key findings from the 2008 PEFA.

93.         The 2004 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)found that
in2002, public procurement accountedfor 16.2 per cent of GDP,that corruptionin
procurement was widespread, capacity low and sanctionsfor corrupt practices were
not effective. The Government has, inresponse, attemptedto comprehensively address
these weaknesses. A new Public Procurement Act, based on internationalprocurement
standards became operational in2004 with the establishment of the Office o f the Director
o f Public Procurement (ODPP), headedby a Director and Deputy Director appointed by


                                               41

the President and approved by the Public Appointments Committee of parliament. ODPP
has policy, standards and monitoring functions and does not directly procure. It has
supervisory oversight of a decentralized procurement system that since 2006 has been
receiving intensive support from the World Bank, UNDPand USAID. This includes
training, by December 2007, o f almost 800 procurement staff of Internal Procurement
Committees (IPCs) and Specialized Procurement Units(SPUs) inministries and
departments; establishment of an ODPP Management Information System and website;
developing the capacity within ODPP to undertake procurement audits; establishing
ministry, department and agency prior review procurementthresholds based on capacity
as assessedby ODPP; establishment o f a referral system for mis-procurements identified
inthe ODPPprior review andprocurementmonitoringprocessesto the Ministry of
Finance and the ACB for investigation; and, facilitation of the establishment of a
professionalbody for procurementpersonnel. While challenges remain, there have been
significant advances inmovingthe public procurement systemtowards acceptable
standards.

Funds Flow Arrangements

94.     An offsite assessmentwas conducted inJuly 2001followed by update
assessments inJuly 2003 and November 2005. The 2005 update assessmentconcluded
that the RBMhad implemented many recommendations of the 2003 safeguards
assessment: (i)the external audit opinion included a second signature from anoffice ina
major financial center and the audit o f the 2004 financial statements was completed
within three months following the end of the year; (ii)task force hadbeen appointedto
                                                        a
review the implementationof InternationalFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and
(iii) capacityintheInternalAuditDepartment(IAD)hadbeenstrengthened.The
     staff
IADnow verifies programdata reportedto the IMFwith the underlyingaccounting
records. However, the assessment also concluded that the role o f the IADinreviewing
data reported to the IMFcould be enhanced by the IADreviewing procedures associated
with the data reporting process.

                             C. Disbursement andAuditing

95.         Upon effectiveness of the financing agreement, expected inJune 2009, a
single tranche of SDR 20.lmillion (USD30 million equivalent) will be made available
to the Government of Malawi. The Grant will follow the Bank's disbursement
procedures for Development Policy Lending. Inparticular, the untied balance of
paymentshudget support will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the
development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases andno procurement
requirements will be needed. It i s envisaged that there will be one more annual single-
tranche operation (PRSC-3), to support the implementation o f the ReformProgram.

96.         The proceeds of the Grant, at the request of the Government, will be
deposited by IDA into an account designatedby the Recipient and which forms part
of the country's official foreign exchange reserves. The local currency equivalent o f
the IDA Grant funds will be deposited inthe Malawi Government ConsolidatedAccount
(MG1Account) at the RBMand will go towards financing the Government budget.


                                             42

Through the Ministry o f Finance, the Recipient will provide within 30 days of receiving
the Grant proceeds, a written confirmation to the IDA when the amount has been credited
to the ForeignExchange Deposit Account andthe ConsolidatedAccount (MG1
Account). The Recipient will also ensure that all withdrawals from the Consolidated
Account (MG1Account) are for budgeted public expenditures. The recipient will also
ensure that foreign exchange reserves generated from this Grant are not used for items on
IDA'Snegativelist. Ifthe proceeds of the Grant are usedfor ineligible purposes as
defined inthe FinancingAgreement, IDA will require the Government to promptly upon
notice form IDA, refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA.
Amounts refunded to IDA upon such request shall be cancelled.

97*          The following arrangements support the requirements related to
fiduciary assurance:

        Foreignreserve account. The Government will acknowledge to IDA receipt of the
        money into the foreign reserve account and the crediting o f the amount inlocal
        currency to the ConsolidatedAccount. While no external audit will be required, it
        i s expected that the confirmation of receipt will be countersigned by the
        authorized signatories, who are the Secretary to the Treasury and the Accountant
        Genera1  .

        Public (Government) accounts. The Auditor General i s requiredby law to produce
        hisannual report to Parliament onthe public accounts within 6 months of the
        financial year-end. IDA will have access to these reports.

        Reserve Bank o f Malawi. The annual entity financial statements o f the Reserve
        Bankof Malawi, audited inaccordance with international auditing standards as
        promulgated by the International Federationo f Accountants, are publicly
        available.

                                D. Poverty andSocialImpact

98.          It is expected that the policy andinstitutional reforms being supported by
the operation will contribute towards the reduction of poverty. This section focuses
on those policies that have the potential to have the most significant positive as well as
adverse effects, andwhat the authorities are planningto enhance the positive effects and
mitigate the negative ones.

99.          Reforms being undertaken inADMARC through the setting up of
MAWTCO are intendedto help reduce poverty among ruralhouseholds. This is
because the main aim o f the reforms i s to ensure that ADMARC concentrates inareas
which are currently not being served by the private sector. As shown by the PSIA
undertaken in2004, it i s inthe rural areas that ADMARC marketing activities are needed.
Itis possible, however, that some areas may end uphavingreduced or no access to
marketing services as a result o f mistakes inthe rationalization process. As a mitigating
measure, ADMARC's monitoring and evaluation i s being strengthened to minimize the
possibility of areas which are neither served by ADMARC nor by the private sector.


                                              43

100.        The restructuring of ADMARC will inevitably leadto the retrenching of
significant numbersof staff. Careful attention has beenpaidto determining a severance
package for staff to be retrenched.

101*         The involvement of the private sector inthe fertilizer subsidy program is
also expectedto have a beneficialimpact on the poor. According to an evaluation
study of the 2006/07 fertilizer subsidyprogram, the participation of the private sector in
the sale of subsidized fertilizer improved availability of fertilizer inthe rural areas.
However, the same study also found that most private traders concentrated inareas which
were more easily accessible, and that some traders were accepting subsidy vouchers in
exchange for goods other than fertilizers and seeds. As outlined earlier, the Government
will be developing an inputmarket development strategy and actionplaninconsultation
with the private sector. It is expected that the strategy will among other things include
incentives for encouragingprivate traders to increase their network o f retail outlets.
Further, it is expected that reforms inADMARC will ultimately lead towards greater
rationalizationof ADMARC's operations such that its operations will be more
concentrated inoutlying areas.     ,


                                 E.Environmental Aspects

102.         The program ingeneral hasno direct environmental impacts. Inorder to
carefully assess environmental aspects o f the PRSC program, the team carried out a
formal environmental assessment in2007 using the DPL toolkit. The assessment
highlightedthat the PRSC supported reforms intobacco marketing could potentially put
significant pressure on the environment. It identified measures that the Government was
planningto put inplacethat could mitigate the potential negative effects, although
challenges were also highlighted. However, as indicated earlier, the PRSC program i s no
longer supporting reforms intobacco. Therefore,

103.         As part of the environmental assessment, the Bank also reviewed the
possibleimpact of PRSC-supported reforms inADMARC and agricultural
marketing, increased fertilizer use, and improvingthe cost of doing business, but
found that the negative environmental impacts of these reforms i s likely to be minimal.

                                   F.Risks andMitigation

104.       The program faces three mainrisks. The first is the macroeconomicrisk
emanating from recent events inthe world economy. The second i s a political risk,
emanating from uncertainty inthe outcome of the upcoming elections. The third i s the
implementationrisk, given the capacity constraints inGovernment.

105.       Although fertilizer, food, and fuel prices have recently been coming down,
they are still higher than normal, and have already put pressure on the fiscal and
balance of payments positions. Given that Malawi is currently implementing a large
fertilizer subsidy program and pursuinga heavily managed exchange rate, the projected
global economic slowdown and the subsequent deterioration interms o f trade are likely
to put further pressure on the fiscal and external balances. This could worsen the



                                               44

environmentfor private sector development, andhence underminePRSC supported
reformsthat aimat improving the functioning of agriculturemarketsthrough improved
participation of the private sector ininput and output markets.To mitigate the risk, the
Bankinconjunctionwith the IMFandother developmentpartners, will beengagedin
policy dialogue with the authoritiesonhow Malawi can dealwith suchrisks.

106.      Given uncertainty in the outcome of the M a y 2009 elections, the future of
some reforms supported by the program is at risk. Malawi goes to the polls on May
19,2009. Follow-up to some of the reforms inthe programwill dependon the political
landscapethat will emerge after the elections. To mitigate againstthis risk, the Bank will
utilize the leveragethat the common approachto budget support grouping has infacing
difficult policy issues with Government.

107.      The systemic problem of capacity constraints in Government continues to
be a risk to the program and is therefore likely to cause delays inthe
implementationof some of the reforms. To mitigate this risk, the Bank will provide
technical assistancewhere requiredusingresourcesfrom Bank investmentandTA
projects currently being implementedinareas also coveredby the PRSCprogram.
Furthermore, the team will work closely with other CABS donors indealingwith these
implementationrisks.

Dear Mr Baxter,

       MALAWI:LETTER OFDEVELOPMENTPOLICYFORTHE SECOND
                  POVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORT GRANT (PRSC-2)

1.        On behalf of the Government of Malawi, Iwrite to request for the second Poverty
Reduction Support Grant (PRSC:2) of US$ 30 million equivalent from the International
Development Association (IDA) in support o f a policy and institutional reform agenda
whose framework has been provided for in the Malawi Growth and Development
Strategy (MGDS), Malawi's second poverty reduction strategy paper. The requested
financing will also help the Government of Malawi fill a financing gap that has been
created by an increase inthe global prices of fertilizers earlier inthe financial year.

2.        The proposed PRSC-2 will support policy and institutional changes in the
following areas: (i) agriculture; (ii) sector development; (iii) protection; and
                                      private                          social
(iv) economic governance. In agriculture, the reforms will continue to focus on
improving the functioning of markets, particularly to deepen maize markets through
facilitating the use o f grain storage warehouses by private traders. Further, PRSC-2 will
also support the strengthening o f input markets, through a performance assessment o f
private sector involvement inthe fertilizer subsidy program. The assessment i s critical to
designing a fertilizer subsidy program that strengthens the private sector. Inprivate sector
development, the reforms supported will include improvements in the operations o f the
Commercial Court that was established in 2007, as reflected through a decline in the


                                             46

length of time it takes to settle commercial disputes. Under social protection, attention
this year has been on implementing procedures to improve targeting o f the fertilizer
subsidy program. Finally, in the area of economic governance, the measures supported
aim at improving public financial management through introduction of a budget calendar,
review o f a payroll management system and the carrying out o f a personnel audit,
submission of outstanding audit reports to Parliament, and cabinet approval of a debt
management policy. More details on the proposedreforms to be supported under PRSC-
2 are set out inPart C of this letter.

A. RecentMacroeconomicPerformance

3.      Inspite of challenging internal and external environments, Malawi continues to
make significant progress inmaintaining macroeconomic stability. For the first time in
many years, the country has completed a full IMF sponsored PRGF program without
interruptions. The 6* and final review of the program was approved by the IMFBoard on
July 14, 2008. Inlight of recent exogenous shocks, we applied for a one year Exogenous
Shocks Facility (ESF) which was approved by the IMFBoard on December 3,2008. W e
intendto request a new three-year arrangement under the PRGFwhen the ESF expires

4.      The key feature o f our macroeconomic program has been fiscal consolidation
focused on reducing domestic debt inorder to create fiscal space for pursuingour poverty
reduction agenda, and crowding in the private sector. Further, our monetary and
exchange rate policies have been geared towards reducing inflation. Complemented by
good weather and a benign donor environment, we have seen these efforts yield positive
results. In 2008, the economy grew at 8.7 percent. While inflation was under pressure
from high oil and food prices earlier in the year, it remained in single digits, ending the
year at 9.9 percent. The average inflation for 2008 was 8.7 percent.

B.ProgressinImplementingthe Malawi GrowthandDevelopmentStrategy

5.      We are now in our third year o f implementing the second poverty reduction
strategy, the MGDS, which covers the period 2006 to 2011.7 The strategy's overall
objective i s to reduce poverty through economic growth and i s organized around five
thematic areas as follows: (i)    sustainable economic growth; (ii) protection and
                                                                         social
disaster risk management; (iii) development; (iv) infrastructure development; and
                                   social
(v) good governance.

6.      Every year we undertake a review of the MGDS to assess progress in the
implementation of the strategy. The first o f such reviews was for the fiscal year 2006/07
and was completed inearly 2008. The second was for the fiscal year 2007/08 andhasjust
been completed. Both reviews show that overall, good progress i s being made in
implementing the MGDS, as reflected in the findings o f the most recent welfare
monitoring survey which suggest that poverty may have declined to 40 percent, from
52.4 percent in 2004/05. The target for the MGDS i s for the rate to reduce to 30-35
percent by 2011.

 The first was theMalawiPoverty Reduction Strategy (MPRS) which coveredthe period2002-2005.


                                                47

C. Reformprogram

7.      In our Letter of Development Policy for PRSC-1, we highlighted details of a
reform program that could be supported under the different PRSCs in line with our
MGDS and your current Country Assistance Strategy. Iwould now like to provide an
update o f the reform program, which will include an account of measures already
undertaken inorder to achieve certain policy objectives, andplans for the future.

(i)Agriculture market reforms

8.      Our main goal in agriculture i s to achieve food security and increase the sector's
contribution to economic growth in order to make a noticeable dent on poverty. In this
regard, our main policy objectives are as follows: (i)   increasing agriculture productivity
through increased and improved input use, (ii)      ensuring food deficit households have
access to grain at affordable retail prices, (iii)
                                                ensuring farmers have access to markets at
fair and remunerative producer prices, (iv) reducing extremes in price and supply
variation through risk management, and (v) ensuring adequate supply of maize for the
strategic reserves for humanitarianuse.

Outputmarkets

9.      In output markets, Government efforts are focusing on ensuring that deficit
households have access to food at affordable retail prices, ensuring that farmers have
access to markets at fair and remunerative producer prices, and reducing extremes in
price and supply variation. Inthis regard, we believe that the private sector has a critical
role to play inhelping us achieve these objectives. Therefore, the main policy thrust will
be to encourage greater participation of the private sector in output markets. Increased
private sector investment in trading will improve availability o f markets. Further, we
believe that increased competition amongst private traders should result in better prices
for farmers and lower consumer prices for food-deficit households.

10.     Given the critical importance of ensuring food security for Malawians,
Government policies on output markets have focused on maize, the staple food crop. In
this regard, the year 2008 was a particularly challenging one for us inthe maize markets.
During the first part of the year, which is also the lean period, there were reports of acute
shortages in several parts of the country, in spite of registering a good harvest the
previous year. Although every year prices tend to rise during this period, they were
unusually high for a normal year. Having already exported around 300, 000 metric tons
of maize, we decided to take a cautious approach and introduced a temporary export ban
on the export o f maize. We had hoped to lift the ban during the harvest season, but the
situation did not improve significantly. Unlike in many other years, there was no
sustained drop inprices inthe post-harvest season. Prices started rising sharply and as the
market reacted to uncertainty in world prices, it reached unprecedented levels. It was
clear in our view that the market had over-reacted, and that the price increases were
driven mostly by speculation about food scarcity following sharp rises in global food



                                             48

prices. We feared that if not contained, these prices would translate into significantly very
highconsumer prices duringthe lean season, makingthe main staple food inaccessible to
most households. We therefore decided to intervene in the market by designating
ADMARC as the sole buyer and seller o f maize at set prices. This measure i s temporary
and the restriction will be lifted once the lean season is over and the situation is back to
normal.

11.      The measures that we undertook in2008 indealing with shortages and price rises
were a second best solution for us. They were taken to correct serious failures in the
market that threatened the food security situation of our people. Otherwise we remain
committed to the promotion o f greater private sector participation in the market. In this
regard, Government has established the Malawi Agricultural Warehousing and Trading
Company (MAWTCO). MAWTCO has been established using excess warehousing
facilities that belonged to ADMARC. It was incorporated on April 9, 2009 and the
company has received six warehouses from ADMARC. In future, M A W T C O will also
be used to facilitate the establishment o f a national warehouse receipts system (WRS).
Under a WRS, producers or traders deposit agriculture produce in a secure warehouse
where they receive a receipt certifying the deposit o f goods o f a particular quantity,
quality, and grade. By using the stock in a WRS as collateral, private traders will be able
to access financial credit from lending institutions. The establishment o f M A W T C O will
therefore promote the participation of private traders in output markets by ensuring that
they have access to good storage facilities andfinancial capital from lending institutions.

12.      To complement these measures, we will also prioritize use o f price-hedging and
commodity risk management instruments in order to reduce price variability and
complement strategic reserves held by the National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA).
Examples of such instruments to be employed are weather derivative contracts,
repurchase option (REPO) contracts, and physical call option contracts. Under weather
derivative contracts, the Government will purchase a weather-based insurance contract
that would make a pay-out inthe event o f a severe draught. This would ensure timely and
reliable funds for us to import maize. Further, in order to minimize the cost o f such
imports, we will purchase a call option contract by paying a premium to lock inthe price
of anticipated grain imports. Lastly, where we anticipate a domestic maize surplus, we
will pay a premiumunder a REPO deal for the private sector to hold stocks inthe country
until we are able to establish that they are no longer needed to meet domestic
consumption requirements. Inthis way, the REPO deal will complement the maintenance
o f strategic grain reserves held by the NFRA without the cost o f holding physical grain.
Further, a REPO deal will also help to prevent producer prices from dropping
significantly at harvest time by providing additional demand and stipulating an initial
purchase price from farmers.

13.      In 2008, Government signed a weather derivatives contract, mediated through
World Bank Treasury, to assure finance in the event of severe national drought that can
be used to facilitate grain imports. We also took commercial bids from domestic banks
and traders on a REPO deal. However, this contract was not completed due to the
unexpectedly sharp rise in maize prices after the 2008 harvest that we have mentioned



                                             49

earlier. However, should there be a severe drought, we are committed to consider a
physical call option inorder to lock inprice and transport commitments underlying maize
imports to resolve national grain shortfalls. Overall, these strategies are expected to
reduce the volatility o f national grain prices. Establishment o f more of a rules based
strategy for such risk management will also clarify the timing and objectives o f
Government interventions in national maize markets, allowing the private sector greater
room for competitive investment.

14.     Institutionally, we plan to develop an operational strategy for commodity risk
management. The strategy will provide details o f circumstances and scenarios under
which the various instruments will be used. It will also define more clearly the role o f
various institutions. We also plan to strengthen our capacity to deal with risk
management issues by establishing an agriculture commodity risk management unit
(ACRMU) in the Ministry o f Agriculture. The unit will act as a technical secretariat for
the existing risk management team which consists o f representatives from Ministry o f
Agriculture, Treasury, Ministry of Justice, Ministry o f Industry and Trade, and the
Reserve Bank o f Malawi. The ACRMU will consist o f a small number o f staff but who
will be highly specialized in various risk management instruments. It will have the
responsibility o f monitoring the situation in the country and providing just in time
technical advice to the risk management team.

Inputmarkets

15.     Given that Malawi faces acute shortage of land, increased use of inputs will
continue to be critical to improving agricultural productivity. At the same time, most
Malawian farmers are poor and rely on smallholder farming. It i s in this regard that the
Government started implementing a fertilizer subsidy program in 2005 in order to
increase access to inputs by poor farmers. One o f the key principles in the
implementation o f the program i s that of ensuring that it contributes to the development
of input markets. Just like inthe output markets, we realize that the private sector has an
important role to play in making inputs readily available in markets and affordable. We
believe that encouraging the private sector to invest in input trading would improve
accessibility and help to reduce input prices through increased competition.            In this
regard, private sector participation in the subsidy program has been seen as one way o f
encouraging the private sector to invest ininputtrading.

16.     Since the introduction of the program in 2005, the bulk o f the fertilizer has been
imported by the private sector. However, at the retail stage, we have so far relied heavily
on the two state owned companies, SFFRFM and ADMARC. For example, only 28
percent o f subsidized fertilizer was sold through private sector outlets in 2006/07 and
about the same proportion in 2007/08. Our reliance on parastatal companies has been
premised on two main factors. First,by using our own companies, we have been sure o f
the availability o f retail outlets across the country, especially in the rural areas. In areas
where markets are not readily available, it has been easier for us to advise ADMARC to
open new outlets. Second, limited amounts of subsidized fertilizer has been sold through




                                               50

private outlets because we have been concerned with reports o f poor services at some o f
the private sector outlets, such as exchange o f vouchers for goods other than fertilizers.

17.     In 2008/09, the level of private sector participation in the subsidy program has
declined further. While private companies have been involved in redemption o f seed
vouchers, they have not participated inthe sale o f subsidized fertilizer. This i s because at
first they declined to participate unless they received some advance payment to help with
their cash flow needs before they could be paid for vouchers redeemed. On our part this
was not possible and unfortunatelyby the time they changed their position and decided to
participate without an advance payment, it was logistically too late. Meanwhile in 2008,
an independent performance assessment was conducted of private sector involvement in
wholesale and retail trade of subsidized fertilizer based on performance indicators agreed
in2007. This confirmed the willingness andcapacity of private wholesalers and retailers
to expand trade o f fertilizer even in outlying areas of the country. Therefore, the
Government remains committed to further strengthening private wholesale and retail
trade of agricultural inputs. In line with this, we will prepare an action plan for input
market development this year. This i s being drafted in close consultation with the
national fertilizer trade association and seed trade association.

18.     The 2008/09 agricultural season also saw a substantial increase inthe quantity o f
the fertilizer purchased for the subsidy program. In total, 72,000 MT o f additional
fertilizers were purchased over the planned 170,000 MT. The mainreasonfor this was an
estimated increase in demand due to the inclusion of new categories o f beneficiaries: tea
and coffee farmers, and victims of floods, who would use it for winter cropping. The
second reason for expansion in quantities was a lapse in coordination among
implementing agencies. It had been decided that those private dealers who were doing
well in delivering fertilizer be assigned the quantities o f others that where not delivering,
but the tenders of the latter had not been cancelled. Later on these dealers also delivered
their quantities. This accounts for an increase of 32,000 MT of the additional fertilizers.
Fertilizers had been bought by dealers at the much high prices occurring earlier in the
year. Government decided that it could not buy the additional fertilizers at lower prices
and force bankruptcies, as this would have a negative impact on the economy.
Government plans to exercise more care in awarding and monitoring tenders to avoid the
double delivery that contributed to the purchase of more fertilizer. The logistics Unit will
be strengthened to manage the process better infuture.

19.      Iwouldliketoclarifytheeffectsofthisexpansionoftheprogramonthebudget
framework. It has turned out that at the end of the agricultural season, a total o f 81,000
MT of fertilizers were not redeemedby farmers and hence undistributed.Government, in
consultation with the IMF, has decided to recoup the cost o f the extra fertilizers
purchased by asking SFFRFM to enter into a buy-back arrangement with commercial
banks. Under the buy-back arrangement, SFFRM, which is a state owned company
responsible for importation and sale o f fertilizer to smallholder farmers, will sell the
excess fertilizers to Standard Bank o f South Africa and local commercial banks at the
lower current price. However, the suppliers will be paid the original high price which
would result in a loss to the SFFRFM. W e agreed with the IMFthat the Government will



                                             51

cover this loss through a subvention that will be reflected in the 2008/09 budget. This
subvention may be as high as $35 million. To finance the subvention, Government may
resort to additional domestic borrowing. As this will be paid during the life o f the ESF
program, the Fund Staff proposed, and we agreed, to adjust the program target on
domestic borrowing. Further, the fact that the expanded subsidy program will be financed
through a buy-back arrangement implies that next season, less than 100,000 MT o f
fertilizer will be imported. The extra tonnage will be purchased locally from SFFRFM.
This will also boost our foreign reserves position.

20.     The original 2008/09 budget allocation to the whole subsidy program was K19.4
billion but was later revised to K29.4 billion due to price escalations. A number of donors
pledged to finance this cost overrun as it was caused by exogenous factors. The K29.4
billion would thus be sufficient to defray the cost o f the planned 170,000 MT.

21.     Therefore, the macroeconomic framework will be affected temporarily by the
extra borrowing the IMF and the Government have agreed to be necessary. The
procurement of excess fertilizers has also exacerbated a seasonal shortage o f foreign
exchange inthe economy. We expect to rectify these temporary setbacks very quickly.

22.     Although a thorough review o f the program has not yet been conducted,
Government has already noted a few shortcomings inthe implementation o f the expanded
subsidy program. In this regard, a full procurement audit for the 2008/09 subsidy
program will be conducted in order to inform areas that need improvement. In the
meantime, Government has already decidedto take some measures to deal with identified
weaknesses. First, as already mentioned earlier, some o f the additional fertilizers were
due to logistical problems, where contracts cancelled due to non-performance were still
delivered due to communication breakdown between implementing agencies. Inorder to
avoid this from happening again, replacement contracts will only be signed after the
original contracts are cancelled. Second, although the extra contracts were approved by
the ODPP, some steps in the awarding of the contracts were not properly followed. In
order to prevent a recurrence o f such lapses, the Ministry o f Finance has established
strengthened procurement procedures. The Director of Public Procurement will not give
a "No Objection" unless he has been satisfied that the procurement entity, inthis case the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, has adequate finances to meet the expenses
intended.Inaddition, the internal audit and control organs of that ministryas well as their
reporting to the Ministry of Finance are being activated. Thirdly, Government has noted
that the quantities o f additional fertilizers procured may have been over-estimated.
Beginning in the financial year 2009/10 the explicit consent o f the Minister o f Finance
will be requiredbefore fertilizer expenditure commitment canbe madeby the Ministry of
Agriculture.

23.      Government also recognizes that the implementation o f the program in general
has faced challenges in identification of beneficiaries, distribution, and accounting for
vouchers. Going forward Government intends to do the following to deal with these
challenges. We will continue implementation of guidelines to improve beneficiary
identification. An exercise will be done to reconcile various data sources on numbers o f



                                             52

potential beneficiaries inthe various categories. W e will limit Government's participation
in distribution of fertilizer. This would be for supply risk management. Government
would then concentrate on supplyingand distributingsecure vouchers.

24.      Government plans to address problems in distributing and accounting for
vouchers. First it will print vouchers with secure features, to reduce counterfeiting.
Second it will ensure that three quarters o f the way through the distribution period, 50%
of the redeemed vouchers are reconciled with the Logistics Unit, and 50% o f purchase
proceeds are remitted to Government. To properly implement these activities, training
and resources for data entry and reconciliation of vouchers will be made available to the
institutions participating indistribution.

(ii) Private sector developmentreforms

25.      The MGDS also emphasizes the need for Malawi to improve its business climate
in order to ensure private-sector led growth. In this regard, Government plans to
undertake several measures to improve the legal and regulatory environment for
businesses. These measures have been outlined in draft policy and strategy documents
that have been prepared by the Ministry o f Industry and Trade in consultation with
stakeholders. Let mehighlight some o f the key measures.

26.      First, we have started a process of reviewing legislation to come up with a single
business licensing law. At present, legislation requires that there are specific licenses for
various economic activities and a complicated fee structure, among other bureaucratic
inefficiencies. The new Single Business Licensing Bill will simplify these procedures,
reducing the time and cost associated with starting a business. In addition, we will also
introduce clear andtransparent criteria for determining business licensing fees.

27.      Second, we planto establish a one-stop shop for investment and exporting. It will
be known as the Malawi Investment and Trade Centre (MITC) and will be formed by
merging the Malawi Investment Promotion Agency (MIPA) and the Malawi Export
Promotion Council (MEPC). The MITC will work in collaboration with the business
licensing and registration department, and Lands Registry for data harmonization and
consistency. In addition, the M I T C will through the Ministry of Industry's Doing
Business Unit work closely with the World Bank's Doing Business Unit responsible for
collecting, managing and reporting data and information on Doing Business indicators. A
billfor the establishment of MITC has already beengazetted.

28.      Third, the ability to efficiently wind-up a business is an important consideration
for investors. It also builds confidence for lending institutions and other parties which
might have a credit claim over a firm. Currently, the process is cumbersome and the
recovery rate for creditors from a closed business is only 15 percent with the bigger
proportion of proceeds going into paying liquidators' fees. We therefore planto introduce
new and clear guidelines on how the courts should proceed inwinding-up a business, and
prescribe a cap onliquidator fees.




                                              53

29.     Finally, Malawi's business environment has also been characterized by weak
contract enforcement and limited access to commercial justice. In particular, capacity in
the court system to deal with commercial type o f cases has been weak, partly due to the
absence o f specialized courts. In 2006, it took an average o f 337 days to enforce a
contract through the court system. As a result, some businesses have been reluctant to
enter into contract arrangements except with the most trusted clients, hence limitingthe
scope for business opportunities and growth. In order to deal with this constraint to
private sector development, a Commercial Division of the HighCourt was established in
May 2007 in order to relieve the current large backlog o f commercial cases in Malawi's
court    system   and to      strengthen   contract  enforcement.   Four judges      have
beenappointed.The establishment o f a Commercial Court has already started yielding
positive results. As o f March 2008, it was taking on average 125 days to settle
commercial disputes, which i s significantly below our target of 290 days for 2008.
Indications are that as of January 2009, the average had gone down further, to 120days.

30.     In spite of a significant reduction in the number of days it takes to settle
commercial cases, the Commercial Court has so far only been hearing new cases. This i s
because there was need to undertake a case audit in the General Division o f the High
Court to identify cases that should be transferred to the Commercial Court. The case
audit has been completed. Further, necessary regulations have been amended to allow for
the transfer of cases to the Commercial Court to commence.

(iii)Social support

31.     Although poverty levels have recently been declining in Malawi, most of our
people remain poor and vulnerable to various types o f shocks, which include illnesses
and deaths (mostly due to malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis), drought related crop
failures, and unaffordable food and input prices. Without any form of support, the most
vulnerable groups which include the ultra poor, the elderly, the chronically sick, persons
with disabilities, orphans and other vulnerable children, have been unable to take
advantage o f economic opportunities or to benefit from economic growth.

32.     Government,     together with development      partners and non-governmental
organizations, has been implementing various types of social support programs to address
the various risks affecting the most vulnerable groups. These programs have included a
fertilizer subsidy program, cash transfer programs, public works programs, and school
feeding programs. However, implementation o f these programs has been beset with
problems o f coordination, targeting, and inadequate funding, among others. As a starting
point, we have developed a social support policy in consultation with all relevant
stakeholders. The policy provides a holistic framework for designing, implementing,
coordinating, monitoring and evaluating social support interventions in Malawi. The
policy has been discussed by Cabinet and a final version will be approved soon. Later,
detailed social support programs will be developed in order to guide the actual
implementation o f the policy.




                                             54

33.     Meanwhile, as we await the final approval o f the policy and development o f
detailed programs, we have already started fixing some o f the problems that have been
identified inthe implementation o f existing social support programs. For example, one of
the problems facing the fertilizer subsidy program has been targeting o f beneficiaries. T o
deal with this problem, improved procedures and guidelines for targeting poor
households under the subsidy program were introduced for the 2008/09 season. The new
guidelines bring greater transparency to the process of identifying beneficiaries, by
expanding the composition o f the identification committee from traditional leaders only
to include other community leaders, such as religious leaders. Further, once short-listed,
beneficiaries have to be confirmed by members of the community at public meetings
specifically called for this purpose. The effectiveness of the new guidelines will be
ascertained after an evaluation has been conducted. However, results o f monitoring
exercises by Government and civil society indicate that targeting was much better this
year. Looking ahead, we plan to continue improving the cost effectiveness and targeting
of the program. To that end, we will introduce more institutional changes to improve its
targeting.

(iv) Public sector andfinance management reforms

34.     Inorder to consolidate the gains achieved in restoring macroeconomic stability,
the Government has been undertaking several policy reforms in the area of budget
process, payroll management, debt management, and external auditing. With regard to
the budget process, the reforms seek to set a foundation for improved linkages between
the budget and the MGDS. In 2008, we prepared and introduced a budget calendar that
incorporates all budget related activities, including the MGDS annual progress review.
As a result, for the 2008/09 budget process, we were able to communicate budgetceilings
to line ministries and departments in good time. This gave them enough time to prepare
their budgets in line with MGDS priorities. Further, we have revised the structure o f the
budget classification and the associated chart of accounts so that the two are fully
consistent with each other. This will make it easier to monitor and report progress on the
implementation of the MGDS. In addition, Government has started implementing the
revised GFS system in order to further improve the budget structure and ensure that it
captures expenditure and revenue codes to suit international standards.

35.     Inpayroll management, we are continuing with reforms that were introduced in
2004. We started with far reaching changes to the civil service wage policy that included
rationalization of grades and salary levels, and a consolidation of most non-discretionary
allowances into the wage. The focus has recently been on strengthening the management
of the payroll itself in order to reduce wastage o f public finances through ghost workers.
Inthis regard, we introduced a new system in September 2006 for managing personnel
and payroll records, the HumanResource Management Information System (HRMIS) to
replace the then existing system, the Personnel, Payroll, Pensions and Advances
Integration (PPPAI) which among other weaknesses, could not update the payroll
whenever there was a change to some personnel records. For the system to operate with
clean data, we embarked on a data reconciliation exercise of payroll with the backlog o f
personnel data which was finalized towards the end of 2007. However, to be sure that the



                                             55

system i s robust, we commissioned an independent review o f the HRMIS, which was
completed in October 2008. Intandem, a personnel audit o f the whole public service was
undertaken. During the exercise, the existence of each individual staff on the personnel
database was physically verified. The HRMIS databasehas subsequently beenupdated.

36.     Following the HRMIS review and Personnel Audit, and action plan has been
developed that will guide Government in the implementation o f recommendations. For
example, in the coming year, we plan to produce a report on actions taken against
individuals who were responsible for introducing non-existing workers on the payroll.
Further, we will start producing monthly audit reports on the payroll. Finally, we are
developing and will implement electronic payroll data transfer between HRMIS and
IFMIS.

37.     In consolidating the macroeconomic gains made in the last few years, we also
continue to focus on reducing domestic debt. In particular, we realize that dealing with
the debt problem requires more than exercising fiscal discipline - systems of debt
management also need to be improved. In 2007, we carried out a comprehensive and
systematic debt management performance assessment with technical assistance from the
World Bank. The assessment helped identify areas o f strengths and weaknesses in our
debt management system. It also provided useful inputs into the formulation of a Debt
Management Policy which was approved by Cabinet inMarch 2009. The policy outlines
clear principles to be adhered to when contracting domestic as well as external debt.

38.     Going forward, we would like to establish mechanisms for improving
coordination between the Reserve Bank of Malawi and the Ministry of Finance in debt
management. Inthis regard, the Debt Management Policy provides for the establishment
of a Debt Management Committee (DMC) comprising o f directors from the Ministry o f
Finance, Reserve Bank of Malawi, Ministry o f Justice and Ministry o f Economic
Planningand Development. The Committee will meet quarterly to discuss developments
indebt management. Notably, additional meetings to discuss urgent issues such as loan
appraisals may be convened at any time, as determined by the committee. The Debt
Management Committee will be supported by a technical sub-committee comprising of
officials from the Ministry o f Finance and the Reserve Bank of Malawi. This sub-
committee will be responsible for analyzing developments in debt management and
preparing policy proposals for consideration by the Debt Management Committee. The
sub-committee will meet monthly to improve the coordination and information flows on
debt issues.

39.     An evaluation of how well the budget has been executed is a critical element of
sound public financial management. In this connection, the Malawi Public Audit Act
provides for internal auditing, external auditing and Parliamentary scrutiny o f the audit
reports. Although considerable progress has been made in the area of internal auditing,
there are still weaknesses in the area of external auditing. First, due to limited human
capacity, very few ministries and departments are audited in a year. Second, preparation
of the audit reports and submission to Parliament has been taking place with a few years




                                            56

of delay. Third, there has been limited follow up on audit recommendations made by the
auditor general and the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament.

40.     In order to deal with these problems, the Government has put in place several
measures. First, the capacity of the National Audit Office has beenstrengthenedwith the
recruitment of more auditors. As a result, a significantly higher number of central
Government entities are now being audited. Second, the roll out of IFMIS in 2005 has
resulted in a significant improvement in timeliness of preparing financial statements in
recent years. For example, the financial statements for the 2007/08 fiscal year were
submitted to the Auditor General towards the end of November, which was only one
month later than the statutory requirement of within four months from the end of the
fiscal year. Before IFMIS, it would take more than one year before financial statements
could be ready for auditing. Improvements intimeliness of preparing financial statements
have had a positive knock-on-effect by improving the timeliness of submitting audit
reports to Parliament. Already, the delayed audit reports for 2004/05 and 2005/06 have
now been submitted to Parliament. It is also expected that the audit reports for 2006107
and 2007/08 will be submittedto Parliament soon. Finally, with regard to follow-up on
audit reports, we will improve in responding to issues raised by the Public Accounts
Committee (PAC) whenever public officers have been summoned to appear before the
committee. Responses to issues raised by the PAC are contained ina report known as the
Treasury Minute which i s prepared by the Secretary to the Treasury (ST). We therefore
intendto prepareand issue these Treasury Minutes on a more regular basis than has been
the case inthe past.

                Malawi-Assessment Letterfor DevelopmentPartners
                           EconomicConditionsandProspects
                                         April 2009
This letter provides an assessment of Malawi's macroeconomic conditions and outlook,
based on information available through March 2009. An IMF team visited Malawi on
March 17-31, 2009for the 2009 Article IV consultation discussions and 1st review under
the Exogenous Shock Facility (ESF). Growth remains strong, infation moderate, and the
impact of the global Jinancial crisis has been limited to this point. Five out of six
performance criteriafor December 2008 were observed, but the net domestic borrowing
target was missed. On the basis of understandings ad referendum onpolicy adjustments,
staffexpects to take the review to the IMF Board in June.

The impact on Malawi of the globalfinancialcrisis has been limitedso far, and the
negative impact of the high fuel and fertilizer prices in first half of 2008 is now
receding. A closed capital account, insignificant foreign portfolio investment, and
limited integration with the world financial system have largely sheltered Malawi from
the turmoil. The financial sector is relatively small, highly solvent, liquid, and profitable.
Moreover, since their peak in mid-2008, world market fuel and fertilizer prices have
fallen by as much as 70 percent. As earlier import contracts expire, Malawi i s now
benefiting from the lower import prices. However, the slowdown in global demand i s
also lowering prices on Malawi's main exports, tobacco, cotton, sugar, and tea, and there
are indications that inflows o f remittances and NGO transfers to Malawi may be slowing
down.

Growth has been strongand inflationmoderate,and these trends are expectedto be
broadly maintainedover the medium term. The authorities estimate output growth in
2008 at 9.7 percent, boosted by good harvests o f maize and tobacco, and steep growth in
telecommunications. IMF staff projects that growth will moderate to 6.5-7.0 and 6.0
percent in 2009 and 2010, respectively, as lower-than-last-year tobacco prices contain
farmer income this year and reduce incentives for planting for 2010-the          authorities'
projections are slightly higher. Inflation declined to 9.7 percent in February 2009
following the Februaryreduction indomestic fuel prices. For 2009 as a whole, inflation is
projected at 8.9 percent, helped by the arrival in the market o f the promising 2009 maize
harvest.

The periodic foreign exchange scarcity has been particularly severe this season.
Malawi has over the last number o f years experienced chronically low and volatile
external reserves, marked by periodic troughs during the "lean season." Reserves as o f
end-February were only US$ll7 million (0.8 months o f prospective imports), partly
reflecting high prices o f key imports in 2008 as well as pressure from excess fertilizer
procurement. The start o f the 2009 tobacco auctions should help Malawi and the RBM
gain access to much needed foreign exchange.




                                             58

Though gross reserves are expected to rise with the end of the lean season, a
determinedpolicy effort is neededto bringthe average level of reserves to a more
desirablelevel. Even at their seasonal peak, Malawi's reserves have fallen short of basic
benchmarks for reserve coverage. As indicated in the ESF documents, the IMF staff has
recommended the implementation of a strategy to raise reserves to 3 months of imports
over the next few years. This includes some moderate additional fiscal effort (repayment
of government net domestic debt to help increase reserves without affecting growth or
crowding out the private sector), as well as measures to increase the efficiency and
flexibility o f the exchange rate system, which the authorities have undertakento study.

The RBM met the key monetary targets on net domestic assets (NDA) and net
foreign assets (NFA) for end-December 2008 with a margin. However, because of
reduced demand for MK cash balances and because o f the difficulties faced by formal
sector importers inusingtheir MK deposits to buy foreign exchange, market liquidity has
increased and t-bill rates declined: t-bill rates have dropped by 140 basis points since
December 2008. For this reason, the authorities and the IMFteam agreed on the need for
moderating money growth going forward.

The domestic borrowingtarget for December 2008 under the ESF was missed, but
recentmeasuresare projectedto putthe fiscalprogramback on track on a full-year
basis.The target was missed by MK 5.9 billion (0.9 percent of full-year GDP) as general
expenditure pressures more than offset strong revenues. The government has introduced
measures in the second half o f the fiscal year to counteract the deviation observed in
December 2008 -including        increases inthe taxation on petroleum products, which have
prevented a full pass-through to domestic prices o f the fall in world oil prices. The
measures adopted so far are estimated to put the fiscal program for the second half of the
fiscal year back on track on afull-year basis. However, it appears unlikely that the initial
slippage can be undone in the time left inFY2008/09. For 2008/09 as a whole, the IMF
staff projects net domestic borrowing inthe order of %i of GDP. Although higher
                                                          percent
than desired, the projected 2008/09 borrowing will still enable net domestic debt to
decline as a share of GDP. For FY2009/10, the authorities plan to submit a budget that
would result in a repayment o f net domestic debt of nearly 1percent o f GDP, inline with
the broad policy objectives established inthe ESF.

Preliminarywork on the update of the debt sustainability assessment continuesto
indicatethat Malawi's overallrisk of debt distressremainsmoderate.Inthe baseline
scenario, all external debt ratios are projected to stay below the relevant debt burden
thresholds, although standard stress tests reveal that Malawi's external debt remains
vulnerable to shocks to export growth.

The implementationof the 2008/09 fertilizer subsidy program has raised concerns
that needto be addressedgoingforward. Total procurement of fertilizers exceeded the
amounts planned in the budget by about 72 thousand metric tons. Although the
govenunent indicates that all or most of this excess will remain available for the next
growing season,l the net cost to the economy i s substantial, because the extra fertilizer
was procured at the highprices that prevailed inmid-2008, causing Malawi to forgo part

of the benefit from the substantial price reductions that occurred in late 2008. The
authorities have agreed that the FY2008/09 fiscal accounts will fully reflect the cost o f
fertilizer distributed to farmers during this fiscal year together with the financial loss
from buying expensive fertilizer that i s left in storage for distribution next growing
season-a     loss measured by the difference between the historical procurement cost o f
that fertilizer and its current collateral or market value. Fertilizer left in storage will be
subject to a buy-back agreement with a state-owned enterprise in the agricultural sector
(SFFRFM). Following the principles explained above, the buy-back will take place at
prices that reflect the collateral value o f that fertilizer, and will be supplemented with a
subsidyfrom the government to SFFRFM to allow the firmto cover the historical cost of
the fertilizer. Going forward, the authorities have expressed their intention to strengthen
the Finance Ministry's control and auditing of the fertilizer subsidy program and increase
private sector participation in retail distribution of fertilizers. Further measures may be
needed, including strengthening the control o f issuance o f vouchers and the procurement
procedures.
