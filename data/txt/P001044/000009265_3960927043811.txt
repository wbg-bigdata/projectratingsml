MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE FXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 29.3 MILLION
(US$40 MILLION EQUIVALENT)
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed develop-
ment credit to the Republic of Guinea for SDR 29.3 million (US$40 M equiva-
lent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 40 years' maturity and would help finance a Second Water Supplv
Project. US$33 M equivalent would be onlent to SONEG on terms of 30 years,
including six years of grace and a 2% interest rate and US$7 M equivalent
would be contributed by the Government to SONEG's equity. The project would
be cofinanced for US$51 M equivalent by the African Development Bank (AfDB),
the European Investment Bank (EIB), and Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Econo-
mique (CCCE) of France.
2.        Background.   Guinea has one of the least developed urban water
supply sectors in West Africa, with ten urban centers only, out of 33,
equipped with piped systems.  Less than half of the urban pordlation of about
2.3 million, of which 1.0 million live in the capital city of Conakry, have
access to piped water, while the remainder rely on unsafe sources for their
water needs.  The First Conakry Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Cred-
it 870-GUI), completed in 1985, helped increase the quantity of water supplied
to Conakry, as well as the drainage conditions through a program of selected
expansion. However, the existing facilities remain in poor condition, and
there is still a need for an extensive rehabilitation program. The political
interference and the adverse economic environment which prevailed throughout
project implementation under the previous political regime ultimately resulted
in sub-standard operations. Moreover, the progress of institutional reforms
was disappointing; the water utility (DEG), recently abolished, became bank-
rupt as a result of inadequate tariffs, billing and collection, and relied
almost exclusively on Government subsidies.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Adequate supply of safe water is a
priority social objective of the Government, which, at the same time, wants to
ensure that the urban water sector is financially self-supporting. While the
project would finance key investments to help the sector take off, it has been
designed as an integral part of the ongoing structural adjustment process and
would primarily focus on implementation of needed institutional reforms and
adequate cost recovery procedures, as well as rehabilitation of operations and
facilities. Improved donor coordination is another important feature of the
proposed project.
4.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project would aim at establishing
an autonomous and self-financing urban water sector by (a) creating an appro-
priate legal and institutional framework; (b) strengthening its planning
capability; (c) rehabilitating its technical, commercial and financial opera-
tions; (d) financing key investments; and (e) gradually raising the currently
very low water rates to meet long-term marginal costs. Assistance to imple-
mentation of appropriate policies for rural water supply is envisaged as part
of a rural infrastructure project, currently under preparation, which would
also finance part of the emergency program recently prepared by the agency
responsible for that sub-sector (SNAPE). Urgent urban sanitation and drainage
needs are being addressed by an Urban Development Project under implementation
(Credit 1466-GUI of 1984 amended in 1987).  A Second Urban Project, under



preparation, would also address the issue of appropriate technoloties and
financing mechanisms for sanitation in the poorest areas.
5.        Sector Reorganization.   The Government  Initiated a major sector
reorganization by creating, in October 1988, the National Water Authority,
SONEG.  SONEG would be the owner of the facilities, and be responsible for
sector planning, construction of new facilities and financial management of
the sector, including its debt service, thus taking over responsibilities
previously scattered among several ministry departments. SONEG would contract
out, under a ten-year lease agreement, operation and maintenance of the
facilities, as well as billing and collection, to a water management company,
SEEG, partially owned by the State, but with a majority share held by a
private professional partner, selected according to procedures acceptable to
the Bank. The legal documents related to SEEG's creation and operations are
also acceptable to the Bank. It. the long run, SEEG would get its revenues
from the rate it would collect from the customers and pay back to SONEG a
rental fee, for each cubic meter of water collected, intended to cover SONEG's
operating expenses, service the sectoral debt and finance part of the invest-
ment program. Until the 150% tariff increase of early 1989, the consumer rate
of GF 60/m' (US$0.12/m9) was not even sufficient to cover the variable cost of
water, and sectoral expenses were subsidized at least by 85%. However, the
new consumer rate of GF 150/ms (US$0.30/m9) is expected to be insufficient to
cover the full cost of distributing water and servicing the sectoral debt
during the initial years of existence of the new institutions.  Therefore,
external funding would still have to cover the foreign expenditures of the
lease contract and the National Budget would still have to service the debt,
both on a declining basis during the six years of the project implementation
period. Provisions are made in an "enterprise contract," to be entered into
by the Government and SONEG, regarding subsequent and regular tariff increas-
es. This pragmatic and entirely transparent subsidization scheme is deemed
effective and appropriate, since the subsidies would be conveyed through
budgetary channels, they would be fully financed, and the arrangement would
exist for a limited period of time on a gradually decreasing basis.
6.        ProJect Description.  To support these reforms, the project would
finance (a) a management support program to SONEG, including technical assis-
tance, consultant and legal counsel services, training activities, office
space and supply of equipment, (b) the rehabilitation of sector operations
through the lease contract between SONEG and SEEG; (c) the rehabilitation of
existing facilities; (d) the partial doubling of the 80 km transmission line
and of the Yessoulou treatment plant supplying Conakry with water from the
Grandes Chutes reservoir, as well as expansion of the distribution system;
(e) studies for water supply in secondary centers; and (f) a training program
to assist DEG's former staff who will be laid off as a result of the reorgan-
ization, and who would be willing to develop their own business in fields
related to plumbing, air conditioning and electricity, where there is a lack
of skills and a sizeable market. The latter assistance comes in addition to
the severance payments and financial assistance already available to all
redundant staff as part of the overall reorganization of the civil service.
Cofinancing is expected from AfDB,  EIB, and CCCE.   The project would be
implemented over a period of seven years. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$102.6 M with a foreign exchange component of US$87.8 M (862).
A breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amount and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement scbedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the



Status of Bank Group operations in the Republic of Guinea are given in Sched-
ules C and D, respectively.
7.        Actions to be Agreed Upon.  Effectiveness of the proposed credit
would be declared after two thirds of the initial contributions to SEEG's
equity have been paid in by the State and its private professional partner,
and after SONEG has selected its staff. Effectiveness of all other cofinanc-
ing arrangements needed for the expansion of the Conakry water supply would be
a condition for disbursement of the categories of the proposed credit allocat-
ed to this specific project element.  During negotiations, assurances were
obtained on the following: (a) all financing for the expansion of the Conakry
water supply would be effective before June 30, 1990; (b) DEG staff of about
500 would be partially split between SONEG and SEEG and a gradual phasing out
program, including training and financial assistance, would be completed by
December 31, 1989, in line with Government agreements and practices for the
entire public sector; (c) SONEG would prepare annual revisions of the enter-
prise contract including financial forecasts for the next three years; (d) SO-
NEG would, in addition to the annual audit reports on its accounts, submit
regular audit repDorts on the volume of water collected by SEEG to document the
disbursement applications for financing of the foreign exchange of the lease
contract; (e) the National Budget would support the sectoral debt service
until 1994 on a declining basis; (f) proper procedures would be implemented
for commitment and appropriation of funds for public water consumption;
(g) the water rates would be regularly aijusted to generate rates of return on
annually revalued net assets in operaticon of 1.5% from 1991 to 1993 and 2.5%
from 1994 onwards; and (h) SONEG would consult with IDA prior to any invest-
ment of more than US$1.0 M equivalent, and would not enter into any borrowing
arrangements unless its internal cash generation is at least equal to the
projected sectoral debt service not reimbursed by the National Budget.
8.        Benefits.  The primary benefits of the project would be the restora-
tion of the water supply service in urban areas, the improved use of water re-
sources, now largely wasted, and the gradual introduction of efficient pric-
ing. In addition, the proposed project would expand the availability of water
supply in Conakry, and would allow to meet demand through, at least, 1997.
9.        Risks.  Risks pertai.' to the political and social opposition to the
actual implementation of the agreed upon institutional reforms and to the
regular water tariffs adjustment required to ensure sound overall sector
development. The financial viability of the sector could also be jeopardized
by uncontrolled expansion of water operations in secondary centers. However,
the convincing commitment of the Government towards the far reaching sector
reforms, the technical assistance and training to be provided to strengthen
SONEG's planning and managerial capabilities and the recourse to a water
management company, SEEG, partially owned by an experienced private profes-
sional partner, which would actually be operational at the time the proposed
credit becomes effective, would help minimize the project risks.
10.       Recommendation.   I am satisfied  that  the proposed  credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the International Development Associ-
ation and. recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
