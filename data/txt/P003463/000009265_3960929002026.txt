MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIOXAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE LAECUTlVE DIRECTORS
ON A !2P.OPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE NATIONAL AFFORESTATION PROJECT
The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit
for SDR 230 million (US$300 million aquivalent) to the People's Republic of
China is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 35 years maturity and would help finance afforestation in fifteen
provinces.
2.          Background.  China is poor in forest resources. Its total forested
area is about 119 million hectares - 13% of its land area - or 0.12 hectares
per capita. This compar3s to a world average of 1.1 hectares per capita.
China is facing a worsening imbalance between supply and demand for wood
products.  It is estimated that the anrual consumption of wood in China is
between 300 and 340 million cubic meters for all uses. About 65 million cubic
meters is produced under the state plan, and another 75 million is officially
recorded as outside-plan production. The difference between apparent
consumption and recorded production consists of imports, unrecorded and
illegal felling and fire and pest losses. Imports o_. wood and wood products
have increased twelvefold since 1970.  Demand for wood products is strong, and
this is reflected in high free-market prices. By the year 2000, wood
consumption is expected to increase by 25 million cubic meters per year,
representing an annual growth rate of 1.6%. Even the present low level of
domestic production exceeds the annual growth increment of the forests by
about 100 million cubic meters.  Each yea-:, about 1 million hectares of
afforested land is lost, leading to increased soil erosion and-loss of plant
and wildlife habitat. Although the Government has afforested up to 5 million
hectares per year during the late 1970s and the early 1980s, the results were
mediocre because financial incentives were low or absent, and the techniques
and supervision of planting and tending were inadequate.
3.    In 1986 China launched a new initiative to develop its forest resources
by establishing more effective management systems. The main elements of the
initiative are: (a) increasing wood production from intensively managed high-
yielding plantations; (b) conservation and sustainable utilization of the
remaining natural forests; (c) farm forestry programs for establishing shelter
belts and woodlots for rural wood and energy supply; and (d) protection of
fragile ecological systems and watersheds. The high-yielding plantation
program of nearly one million hectares proposed for IDA financing has the
highest priority and is the first step in a 10-year plan to establish about 3
million hectares of intensively managed forest stands. The Government is in
the process of developing a comprehensive forest resource development
strategy. The proposed project will be a vehicle to improve, with IDA funding



-2-
and expertise, forest resource management planning and formulate a well
balanced oational forestry investment strategy.
4.          The Bank Group's strategy for lending to China's forestry sector
is to continue support for expanding China's forest resources, improve its
management, and ensure that the forestry sector contributes directly to the
protection of China's environment. IDA is already financing the Forestry
Development Project (Cr. 1605-CHA), approved in June 1985, which supports
plantation forestry in three provinces, and the Da Xing An Ling forest Fire
rehabilitation project (Cr. 1918-CHA), approved in June 1988. On the basis of
successful cooperation in these programs (total IDA credits US$96.7 million),
the Government requested Bank assistance to introduce state of the art
plantation technology, and to set up the institutional and managerial
framework required for efficient wood production on a national basis.
5.          Rationale for Bank Involvement:  Massive investment in high-
yielding commercial stands will be the only way to slow significantly both the
foreign exchange outflow for wood imports and the depletion of natural forests
within China and elsewhere in Asia. The Bank Group's involvement would
provide China with access to improved technologies and to the know-how for
strengthening management of the National Afforestation Program and the
institutional structure of the central, provincial and county levels. The
project has also helped to design the restructuring of forest research to
enable the Government to better respond to the quality and productivity
requirements of the next century. It also has introduced the principles of
economic and financial analysis in planning of forestry investments. In
addition, it has provided the opportunity for a long term dialogue on policy
and management practices in the forestry sector as a whole. Subsequent
follow-up projects would address broader forest resource management issues, in
addition to financing further afforestation activities and research.
6.          Ob1ectives and Scope.  The project has six main objectives:
(a)   to expand the forest resources and reduce the gap between timber
production and consumption;
(b)   to improve the quality and productivity of the forest plantations
through the use of superior planting stock by better seed
selection and expanding clonal production and to increase the
productivity of timber forests by introducing and disseminating
superior techniques of plantation establishment and intensive
management;
(c)   to introduce methods of sound environmental management in
plantations;
(d)   to strengthen the research and extension programs that support
plantation forestry and improve their focus on species
performance;



- 3 -
(e)   to introduce financial and economic analysis for forestry
investment so as to make more efficient use of resources; and
(f)   to create the organizational and managerial infrastructure to
plan, appraise, finance, implement and evaluate plantation
programs on a permanent basis.
7.          Project Description.   The project has four major
components:
4               (a)   Plantation Establishment:  establishment of 675,500 hectares of
coniferous and 309,500 hectares of broadleaved plantations in
fifteen provinces. The plantations would be established by state,
collective and cooperative forest farms.
(b)   Research:  assistance for setting up the institutional
arrangements, the research programs and the scientific capability
to focus on genetic improvement; fertilizer trials; mycorrhiza
inoculation; and early wood property testing.
(c)   Improvement of Planting Material:  assistance for accelerated
development of superior planting material by improving seed
production areas, setting up large scale production of clonal
planting stock and initiating a hybridization program.
(d)   Organization and Management:  development of a new organization
and management structure for the high-yielding plantation program
within the central, provincial and county forest administrations,
including the introduction of a monitoring and information system
to test the specific needs of the high-yielding plantation program
before its introduction elsewhere in MFO.
8.          In addition to these major components, the project would introduce
environmental guidelines for high-yielding plantation schemes.   MFO will also
prepare pilot forest resource management plans for several provinces. The
project, to be carried out over 6 years, provides funds for fertilizers,
pesticides, imported seeds, establishment and tending of ;'.antations, research
and computer equipment, training and technical assistance. The total project
cost is US$499.6 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$66.5 million
(13Z). Retroactive financing of up to US$20 million is being recommended for
expenditures made after March 5, 1990.  A breakdown of costs and financing is
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively, and maps are attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 8487-CHA, is being distributed separately.
9.          Actions Agreed on:  To ensure effective implementation of the
project, the national and local Governments have agreed that they will (a)
establish and maintain the project plantations in accordance with the Ministry



- 4 -
of Forestry's "Standards for Fast Growing and High Yielding Plantations' which
is acceptable to IDA; prepare progress reports on the implementation of the
afforestation program by March 31 and September 30 of each year; (b) carry out
project activities in accordance with MFO's agreed Environmental Guidelines
for Afforestation, and avoid planting on land containing natural forest whose
canopy covers more than 30% of the area or that has historical, cultural or
biological significance; (c) prepare and furnish to IDA for review draft
Forest Resource Management Plans for three provinces bv June 30, 1991; (d)
carry out the agreed research programs on high-yielding forest species and
prepare a detailed scientific report on the activities and findings of the
research program by December 31 of each year; (e) carry out the agreed
Accelerated Program for Improvement of Planting Material and prepare by
December 31 of each year a progress report on the program's activities during
the preceding year; (f) prepare a detailed plan for pilot plantations by
November 1, 1990; (g) prepare a detailed preparation plan for about 330,000
hectares of plantations by November 1, 1990; (h) recover the cost of project
investments from participating forest farms through a combination of shares of
production, interest payments and taxes; and (i) report annually about
prevailing levels of timber prices ir the project area and the methods of
setting them.
10.         Benefits and Justification:  Over a 20 year period, the project
will produce about 137 million cubic meters of timber and 25 million tons of
fuelwood, with a total value. of US$10.7 billion at current financial prices.
It will generate significant environmental benefits by increasing the overall
forest cover and rehabilitating degraded, low productivity land. The increase
in wood supply will reduce pressure on overharvesting of natural forests. The
project would also strengthen the capacity of MFO and its provincial and
county level counterparts to plan and monitor the enviro tental aspects of
afforestation projects on a permanent basis. The proj. s afforestation
activities will generate over 680,000 person-years of Ik for rural dwellers
during the project's six year period, and over 7 millioi. person-years
throughout the plantations' lifetimes. This will be w'inly seasonal and part
time work for farm families who tend to have incomes below the provincial
averages because most of the forest areas are remote and hilly or otherwise
not ideal for agriculture.
11.         Risks. The project will be implemented by the Ministry of
Forestry, which has successfully implemented two IDA-financed projects. The
risk that wood production will be less than expected is very limited. The
projected yields, while higher than the prevailing averages, have already been
achieved in China and are realistic for the sites selected. The afforestation
entities have agreed to take appropriate steps to reduce the possibility of
fire and pest losses. The main risk to project success is whether the
afforestation entities' expected returns will continue to give them enough
incentive to manage the stands properly. IDA and MFO will annually monitor
the prevailing wood prices in the project areas and their effect on the
forest farms' expected revenues.



12.         Recommendation.  I am satisiied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recormend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
