I. THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
A. The Energy Sector
Energy Resources
1.01     There are no known deposits of coal or lignite nor any proven
reserves of oil or gas in Jordan. A small hydro potential is confined to
about 2 MW (4 GWh p.a.) at the existing King Talal Dam on the River Zarqa,
a possible 20 MW (50 GWh p.a.) at the future Maqarin Dam near the Syrian
border, some micro-hydro projects using seasonal river flows, and
development of a hydro link between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea (up to 300
GWh p.a.).  Geothermal potential, which exists mostly in the north, has
been investigated under the first phase of a UNDP study. The prospects for
development do not look bright at present mainly due to the low temperature
of the water. However, the volume of water is large and further studies
may be worthwhile, e.g. additional shallow drilling to obtain further
indications of temperature gradients or the drilling of a deeper hole to
try to find hotter water. There are traces of uranium in most of the
phosphate areas, although a recent scintillometer survey has not raised
hopes very high. Any development of nuclear power is most likely to be for
an international power grid. Tar sands exist near the Dead Sea. These
might be eventually developed for use by small industries. Prospecting for
oil and gas deposits is not at present being pursued with any vigor,
following the lack of interest shown by expatriate institutions in taking
up licenses for seismic studies in particular areas.
1.02     Undoubtedly the most promising known indigenous energy resources
are oil shale and, to a lesser extent, solar energy. The present estimate
places the amount of oil shale in Jordan at 10,000 million tons. Deposits
have been examined most thoroughly in the area of Al-Lajjoun near El Hasa,
where about 1,300 million tons have been proven, with a potential oil
content of 65 to 70 liters per ton. There are two major options for using
the oil shale; (i) grind it and use it like lignite in a boiler, probably
in a power station, and (ii) extract the oil. Studies have been mounted on
each of these possibilities, and are expected to be completed in about 15
to 18 months time. A Russian team is studying the first option for a
300 MW power station, possibly at Qatrana, and a German team is studying
the second option. Major problems will be the heavy investment needed for
any commercial project, the amount of water required and the volume of
ash/slurry produced. The problem of large investment requirements will
occur also with any direct use of solar energy for producing electricity
via photovoltaic cells. Although solar energy is very plentiful in Jordan,
its future usage is likely to be limited to water heating.
Organization and Institutions
1.03     The major institutions directly involved in the energy sector are
the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company (JPRC), the Natural Resources
Authority (NRA), the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA) and the Royal



Scientific Society (RSS). JPRC, a semi-private organization in which the
Government holds a majority of the shares, deals with the importation of
crude oil, its processing, distributing and marketing. NRA is responsible
for the exploration of non-renewable energy resources, e.g. oii, gas, oil
shale and tar sancds. JEA and other organizations dealing with power
generation and supply are described below (paras. 1.14-1.24). Basic and
applied research on the existing and potential sources of renewable energy,
e.g. solar, wind and biomass, is usually carried out by RSS. These
institutions report to the Council of Ministers, which is advised by the
National Energy Council (NEC) consisting of representatives of the
institutions mentioned above and other organizations and agencies dealing
with the energy sector. NEC has not been very active; it has no permanent
professional stafE, no financial means to commission necessary studies on
important energy sector issues, and experiences difficulties in arranging
meetings of its aLready very busy members. To improve the coordination of
the activities of the energy-related institutions, the Energy Department in
the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT) was created in late 1979.  This
department, composed of a small professional staff and headed by a capable
director, has just begun to function. It needs to be strengthened to
develop adequate energy planning capabilities and to improve coordination
among energy-related institutions, particularly in connection with the
development of indigenous energy resources. The Government has agreed to
submit by June 30, 1982 to the Bank for its review and comments a plan for
(i) strengthening the planning and management of the energy sector, and
(ii) improving the coordination among the energy-related institutions in
Jordan.
Energy Supply and Demand
1.04     Jordan is at present totally dependent on imported crude oil for
meeting its energ-y sector demand. The crude oil is imported from Saudi
Arabia via Trans-Arabian pipeline which crosses Jordan. Jordan also
imports very small quantitites of petroleum products, mostly lubricants and
some LPG. Virtually all petroleum products consumed are produced
domestically at a refinery operated by JPRC. The refinery has a capacity
of 12,000 tons a day. The petroleum products are transported by road, with
the exception of the requirements of the power plant at Zarqa, which is
supplied directly from the refinery by a special pipeline. The costs of
imported crude oil in Jordan have risen from US$6 million (about 1% of
gross national income) in 1970 to an expected US$360 million in 1980, about
12% of gross national income and an intolerable 154% of country's exports.
To rectify within a reasonably short time the disadvantages of having a
single energy source, crude oil, imported and processed at only one
location, Jordan plans to examine the overall advantages and disadvantages
of importing another fuel. The studies being carried out on the proposed
large thermal power station at Aqaba cover these points and their terms of
reference include consideration of the use of coal as a fuel instead of
fuel oil.
1.05     Despite the very large increase in oil prices, energy consumption
in Jordan has increased over the last ten years from 0.45 million tons of



oil equivalent (mtoe) in 1970 to 1.6 mtoe in 1979, an average annual increase
of about 15% (Annex 1.1). The estimate for 1980 was 1.84 mtoe, an increase of
about 15% over 1979. Energy consumption per capita has increased from 286 to
730 kilograms of oil equivalent p.a. within the ten-year period (1970-79),
compared with a current overall world figure of about 2,000 kilograms of oil
equivalent per capita, and about 600 for all developing countries. In 1979
the transportation sector accounted for about 50% of the total fuel
consumption in Jordan, industry and domestic 15% each, electricity 14% and
other non-major consumers 6%. Jordanian forecasts show crude oil requirements
at about 2.75 million tons in 1985 (10% p.a. increase since 1979) and about
3.70 million tons in 1990 (6% p.a. increase after 1985). These forecasts do
not include the future requirements of the new Aqaba steam power station which
are estimated at 0.25 million tons in 1986 and 1.03 million tons in 1990. The
impact of burning fuel oil at the Aqaba steam power station could
substantially alter the projections and unbalance the presently planned
products mix at the refinery.

1.07     Jordan's energy sector suffers from the absence of an integrated plan
for the development of its energy resources. Work has been initiated in
several areas and the institutions responsible for implementing this work are,
in most cases, technically capable and administratively efficient, but
coordination among them needs improvement. The development of Jordan's energy
sector has to be viewed with respect to two time horizons; the short run
covering a period of about five years or less, and the long run involving a
period longer than five years. In the short run, the only option available to
the Government lies in improving the efficiency by which imported energy is
being utilized. In the long run, the Government would focus on the
exploration for indigenous energy resources and development of the technology
rfor the use of these resources. The short run strategy for the development of
Jordan's energy sector would include: (i) the strengthening of the
capabilities for energy planning; (ii) the improvement of the policies for the
managernent of the demand for energy; and (iii) the formulation of a long term
program aimed at the exploitation of Jordan's domestic energy resources. The
strengthening of the Energy Department at MIT would enable it to take full
responsibilities for all the aspects relating to the planning and management
of the energy sector (para. 1.03). Demand management would involve the
fornmulation of policies for the rationalization of energy prices, and programs
for energy saving consisting of energy audits, interfuel substitution,
cogeneration and waste heat recovery. The formulation of a program for the
exploitation of Jordan's domestic energy resources would involve assessing the
optimal uses for the existing resources and the exploration for new potential
sources of energy.
1.08     In order to address the above matters the Energy Department at MIT
has recently been active in drawing up terms of reference for consultants ser-
vices, the objective of which is to assist the Government in creating a
country energy policy, improving demand management and developing indigenous
energy resources. The Government is anxious that the Bank takes an active
role in technical assistance to the Jordanian energy sector. The proposed
Project provides for energy consultants services to the Government and its
Energy Department at MIT in connection with the energy sector development
strategy and pricing policy (para. 2.02). The next major power project (the
Aqaba steam power plant), which is included in the Bank's FY83 lending program
to Jordan, would enable the Bank to assist the Government in further energy
sector improvements. The Government has agreed to employ by December 31, 1981
oualified energy consultants to assist the Government in decision-making on
energy pricing, demand management, energy conservation and strategy for
indigenous resources development. Jordanian energy-related authorities and
institutions would be adequately involved in this work. The Government would
furnish to the Bank by December 31, 1982 a timetable, satisfactory to the
Bank, of actions to be undertaken to implement such recommendations of the
energy consultants as are appropriate.

Energy Pricing
1.09     The prices of petroleum products are set by the Government.  Their
level is revised periodically as the cost to the Government of importing crude
oil increases. The Government subsidizes the prices of all petroleum products
with the exception of gasoline and LPG which are taxed. The Government's
policy of subsidizing the prices of petroleum products is aimed at dampening
the effects of the increased prices of imported crude oil from being reflected
in the general price level. The subsidy for kerosene and gas oil/diesel used
by the residential consumers for household purposes such as cooking and space
heating stems from the Government's desire to provide these fuels at prices
that are affordable by the low income urban or rural consumers. The burden of
the subsidy for petroleum products has been increasing ever since 1973 when
the first significant change in the price of crude oil took place. By 1978,
the total burden of the subsidy for the domestic consumption of petroleum
products reached US$65.0 million which represented 42% of the total oil import
bill for that year. In early 1979, the Government decided to reduce the
subsidy for petroleum products, and since then, the domestic prices were
increased four times (in March and July of 1979, February 1980 and February
1981). Table 1 below summarizes the relationship of the domestic and border
prices for petroleum products after the increase of February 1980 (the prices
after the increase of February 1981 are not available).

1.10     As a result of the increases in the domestic prices of petroleum
products in 1979, the subsidy was reduced to 39% of the oil import bill for
that year (US$89 million compared to US$244 million). For 1980, the subsidy
was expected to be further reduced to about 26% of the oil import bill. For
1981, the level of the subsidy would change because of the increase in the
import price of oil since December 1980 and the increase in the domestic
prices of petroleum products in February 1981. The exact level of the subsidy
expected in 1981 is however not known.

1.11     JEA serves as a regulatory body of the Government for electricity
rates that may be set by the investor-owred power supply utilities such as the
Jordanian Electric Power Company (JEPCO) and the Irbid District Electricity
Company (IDECO) as well as for rates applied to JEA's direct cnnsumers. JEA's
tariffs for the bulk supply of electricity consist of a maximum demand charge
(JD 2.4/kW per month) and kWh charges for daytime use and off-peak
consumption. Consumers are required to maintain the power factor at their
installations at not less than 0.85. In case of any decrease in the power
factor below 0.85, the consumer has to pay, in addition to his electricity
bill, a penalty specified in the electricity tariffs. JEA has the right not
to supply any consumer if his low power factor affects the system and he takes
no action to improve the power factor.  By virtue of the General Elec-ricity
Law (1976) the retail tariffs for electricity supplied by JEA and power
companies in their concession areas consist of domestic, commercial, small and
large industries rates, together with a maximum demand charge, and daily and
nightly kWh charges. Special tariffs apply for electricity consumed in water
pumping for irrigation and drinking as well as for lighting streets and public
areas. Places of worship, schools, hospitals and charities are granted a
reduction of 25% of their electricity bills.  There is a charge of 1 fil per
kWh on all retail electricity sales by JEA and the concession companies to
finance rural electrification through a special rural electrification fund.
1.12     The exist:ing tariffs, which were introduced on March 6, 1980, are
summarized in Annex 1.2. In order to reduce subsidies and to reflect directly
the costs to the economy of meeting electricity supply requirements, the
Government increaed the rates about 70%.  The new rates are among the highest
in the region for some categories of electricity consumption; e.g., the
commercial rate for daytime use is 57 fils/kWh (US$0.19/kWh), while comparable
rates are in Israel 20 fils/kWh and Cyprus 27 fils/kWh. At the beginning many
customers objectecl or complained about the new tariff rates but now the
situation appears to be reasonably settled. The electricity tariff structure
is based on consultants' studies under the two Credits granted to the
Government of Jordan for power projects. A fuel adjustment clause is
incorporated in the tariffs. Each 100 fils increase in the cost above JD 30/t
for fuel oil and JD 42/t for diesel oil wil result in electricity rates
increase by 0.041 fils/kWh. JEA's long run average incremental cost (LRAIC)
for sales to JEPCO and IDECO is about 25.7 fils/kWh and for sale to the large
industrial consumers is about 30.9 fils/kWh. Both rates are fairly close to
JEA's average prevailing tariffs for sale to these consumers. JEA's tariff
for sale to the low voltage consumers is about 41 fils/kWh which is higher
than the average LRAIC of supply of 33.7 fils/kWh. JEPCO's and IDECO's
average tariffs for sale to their low voltage consumers are also hnigher than
the LRAIC. Theref'ore, from the resource allocation point of view, the average
electricity tariff- in Jordan is in fact conveying to consumers the proper
signals about the economic cost of the resources used in meeting their demand.
B. The Power Subsector
Organization
1.13     MIT controls the power and energy sector.  The General Electricity
Law, passed in 1976, defines the principles and basic regulations for the



-7-
power subsector in Jordan and also specifies the procedure for tariff
approval, granting licenses for power facilities, inspection of works and
collection of statistical data. The main organizations involved in power
generation, transmission and distribution are JEA, JEPCO and IDECO, Some
large enterprises (phosphate, cement and refinery) have their own captive
power plants. Several small towns and villages in the Central and Southern
regions operate mobile diesel generators to supply mainly lighting loads.
The Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA)
1.14     JEA is a Government-owned utility established by Law No. 21 1/
in 1967 to foster the coordinated development of the country's power sub-
sector. According to the General Electricity Law, the main responsibilities
of JEA are: to prepare plans and programs for the electrification of Jordan;
to construct power facilities; to carry out rural electrification; to manage
the Rural Electrification Fund; to generate, transport and distribute
electricity directly or through independent distribution companies (JEPCO and
IDECO); and to regulate power consumption in the country. JEA is also
authorized to manufacture electrical and other equipment needed for the power
system. The law provides that JEA should be both financially and administra-
tively independent. JEA has a board of eight directors appointed by the
Government. The Minister of Industry and Trade is the Chairman of the Board
and the Director General of JEA is an ex-officio member of the Board.
Although a rather new and rapidly growing institution, JEA has already proven
its competence and capabilities in carrying out its responsibilities.
1.15     While JEA is responsible for electricity generation, transmission and
distribution throughout Jordan, power operations in the cities of Amman and
Irbid are entrusted to the concessionary companies of JEPCO and IDECO. JEA's
involvement in distribution activities outside the Irbid and Amman areas and
its active role in promoting regional electrification are justified since it
would not be reasonable to have more small, separate entities involved in
electrification of small towns and villages, where the Government's financial
support is still needed. JEA has taken over several small organizations,
which had been supplying power to remote towns. The present set-up of JEPCO
and IDECO existing alongside JEA in the power subsector appears to be sensible
for the foreseeable future.
1.16     JEA is well organized and properly managed.  Its present organization
structure is based on the recommendations of the management consultants
appointed under Credit 386-JO. Details of the organization are shown in
Annex 1.3 (Chart WB 22339). JEA's Director General, a capable and experienced
engineer whose reputation is internationally known, is supported by the Chief
Engineer and departmental managers. All managerial staff have a university
education and several years of experience in power operations in Jordan and
abroad.
1/  Amended afterwards to become the General Electricity Law No. 8/1976.



1,17     The Authority has a total staff of 1,373 with 681 technical staff
of which 114 are graduate engineers. At the end of 1980, about 180
positions were vacant. These vacancies are mostly related to new projects
to be started in 1981 and reflect rapidly increasing staffing requirements
needed to meet JEA's intensive growth. JEA staff salaries are appropriate
for Jordanian circumstances.  Although there is a continuous movement of
qualified technica'L staff to oil-rich Arab Gulf countries, where salaries
are much higher, the majority of the staff does not stay more than two-
three years abroad after which they return to Jordan to join JEA or JEPC0,
Lhe major employers of the technical staff experienced in power supply
operations.
1,18     JEA pays due attention to the training of its staff.  In con-
nection with the Third Power Project (Loan 1688-JO) JEA has prepared a
detailed and satisfactory staff training program and implementation
schedule covering all JEA's training needs. This program, which would be
implemented by the end of 1983, will enable JEA to develop and improve its
technical, financial and administrative services (para. 2.03).
The Jordanian Eleciric Power Company (JEPCO)
lc19     JEPCO is an investor-owned utility which distributes electricity
to the city of Amman and its environs covering an area of about 2,000
km2. The company is owned 68% by individuals, 7% by municipalities, 4%
by companies, 14%  by JEA and the rest by various institutions. JEPCO's
M-ain generating station at Marqa was transferred to JEA in 1976 and two
other small and inefficient stations were retired causing JEPCO to cease
activities in power generation. JEPCO now purchases all power from JEA at
the 33-kV voltage Level. Since JEPCO is the major power distributor in
Jordan (about 80% of total sales in 1980), the continuation of its sound
development is very important for the entire power subsector.
1,20     The Concession Agreement (1962) between the Government and JEPCO
for the power suppLy in the Amman area for a fifty-year period specifies
JEPCO's rights and obligations and the Articles of Association (1978)
define matters concerning the company's capital, responsibility of share-
:.olders, issue and sale of shares, procedures of the General Assembly,
election and activities of the Board of Directors, distribution of profits,
auditing, etc. JEPCO's Board of Directors is composed of eleven members;
tWo of them are nominated by the Government and the other nine are elected
by the General Assembly.  To encourage JEPCO to play a more active role in
rural electrification and power supply to low cost housing estates, the
Government has arranged loans for it from international and bilateral
financial institutions, such as the European Investment Bank, USAID, etc.
1l21     JEPCO's organizational structure is shown in Annex 1.4 (Chart
X7B 22337). Basic improvements are needed in JEPCO's organization and
ainagement in order to improve the quality of the company's services and



- 9 -
its efficiency. Improvement of billing procedures and the establishment of
a satisfactory management information system are especially necessary.
JEPCO has agreed: (i) to employ by December 31, 1981 consultants with
qualifications and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank to recommend
by December 31, 1982 improvements in JEPCO's organization, billing system
and management practices; and (ii) after taking into account the Bank's
comments, to implement promptly the consultants recommendations.
1.22     At the end of 1980, JEPCO had 1,215 employees, of which 782 were
in operations. Although JEPCO's staff salaries are somewhat higher than
JEA's, JEA is more attractive for engineering staff because of its
extensive development. In addition to regular salaries and wages, JEPCO
has introduced 13th and 14th month salaries, accommodation allowances,
discount for electricity consumption and other incentives in order to
retain its professional and skilled labor staff.
1.23     JEPCO's training programs have been carried out with the assist-
ance of the Jordanian Vocational Training Corporation. About 100 students
have been selected to be trained with various technical teams in the com-
pany for a period of three years. In addition 20 students, sponsored by
JEPCO and attending courses at engineering colleges, are being trained in
the technical and administrative departments of the company. In 1979 two
engineers were sent to the UK and the USA to attend training courses.
Although the previous training of JEPCO's staff has been satisfactory,
further continuous efforts are needed to intensify JEPCO's training activi-
ties and prepare comprehensive staff training programs covering all basic
training needs (para. 2.04).
The Irbid District Electricity Company (IDECO)
1.24     IDECO, the other concessionaire company, operates a diesel power
station (9 MW) and distributes power in the Irbid area, in part of the
Jordan Valley and in some rural areas. Power consumption in the IDECO
concession area is less than 10% of the total power consumption in Jordan.
The company is owned 46.5% by JEA, 42.5% by the Municipality of Irbid and
11% by private investors. IDECO used to have major managerial and finan-
cial problems which have now been resolved. JEA seconded its managerial
staff to IDECO and the company's organization and management have been sub-
stantially improved and have now reached a satisfactory level. With the
assistance of the Government, all necessary financing has been secured for
IDECO's development program during the period 1981-1985. IDECO's rural
electrification schemes are financed by loans obtained from the USSR and
the UK.

Historical Development of the Power Subsector
1.25     National power subsector statistical data for the period 1971-1979
and details of JEPCD and IDECO data are shown in Annexes 1.5 and 1.6. From
1971 to 1979 total generation (including imports) increased from, 230.4 GWh
to 885 GWh, while consumption of electricity rose from 204 GWh to 723 GWh
(trend growth rate 18% p.a.). Electricity sales in 1979 are summarized
below by customer categories and administrative districts:

1.26     Industrial consumption has been increasing rapidly in the last
several years. The total electricity losses are in the order of 18% of
generation. This is a result of still undeveloped transmission and
distribution networks and small inefficient generating units. The maximum
demand of the interconnected system reached 153 MW in 1979. Electricity
consumption per capita amounted to 408 kWh in 1979 compared to 162 kWh in
1974.  Thus, by 1979 Jordan had achieved about the same level of per capita
consumption of electricity as Egypt had in 1977 or Portugal in 1952.  About
36% of the total population, mostly in rural areas, still has no access to
public electricity supply (details in Annex 1.7). A rapid increase in
rural electrification is expected in the next five years (para. 1.36).  The
Central and Southern regions of Jordan are relatively undeveloped and the
Government is endeavoring to accelerate their development by locating
future industrial projects there and electrifying towns and villages.
1.27     The public power system operates at present three 33-MW steam
units, four gas turbines and about twenty small diesel generating sets.
Details of generating capacities are given in Annex 1.8. The national
transmission network comprises 135 km of transmission lines and six
transformer substations with installed capacity of 285 MVA. Operation and
maintenance of power plants and the transmission network is satisfactory.
1/  Street lighting was provided free of charge at the Government's request.



- 11 -
1.28     JEA is responsible for power distribution in Aqaba, Ma'an5 Karak
and part of the Jordan Valley and its distribution network consists of 360
km of overhead lines and cables. JEPCO's distribution network comprises
about 315 km of high voltage overhead lines and 472 km of high voltage
underground cables. The low voltage distribution network (0.4 kV) in the
JEPCO concession area consists of 1,752 km of overhead lines and 111 km of
underground cables. The total installed capacity of JEPCO's distribution
substations is about 155 MVA. JEPCO's distribution facilities are very
modern, but in spite of this, the quality of service is not always satis-
factory due to the lack of skilled labor and shortage of materials. IDECO
distributes electricity to 53 towns and villages in the Irbid district.
IDECO's distribution network consists of about 960 km of overhead lines and
30 km of underground cables.
1.29     Only 115 of Jordan's  982 villages have been electrified so far.
About 45% of the population living in rural areas has access to the public
power supply. JEA, JEPCO, IDECO and the Jordan Valley Authority OJVA) have
been involved in the development of rural electrification. Financing of
rural electrification has been by Government funds and foreign borrowings.
Rural electrification networks were properly designed and constructed, and
their operation and maintenance are satisfactory. Villagers pay for
services rendered to them and electricity consumed.
Development Program
1.30     The national load forecast for the period 1980-1985 (Annex 1.9)
shows total electricity sales increasing from 796 GWh in 1980 to 2,468 GWh
in 1985, with an annual growth rate of 21% p.a. The power system is
expected to be fully interconnected in 1984. The high rate of load growth
is caused primarily by a rapid increase expected in JEA's direct sales to
large industries and other consumers. Details of the interconnected
system's development are given in Annex 1.10. The maximum demand would
increase from 187 MW in 1980 to 462 MW in 1985. The available generation
capacity is expected to grow from 259 MW in 1980 to 589 MW in 1985, Except
in 1985 when the available capacity margin appears rather low, because no
new generation will come on stream in that year, the capacity margin is
reasonable. The system's load factor is expected to improve from 49% in
1980 to 67% in 1985, which indicates the anticipated better utilization of
generating facilities. The forecast of sales by consumer categories is
given in Annex 1.11. Sales to JEPCO would represent 77% of JEA's total
sales in 1980 and 54% in 1985.    The sale to large industries will
increase from 9% of the total JEA sales in 1980 to 31% in 1985, which
reflect development of several large industries in the Central and Southern
Regions of Jordan. The load forecast implies that per capita consumption
would rise from the 1979 level of 408 kWh to some 990 kWh in 1985. The
load forecast is reasonable in relation to Jordan's present stage of
development and its general economic prospects. However, some of the new
projected industrial loads (Annex 1.11) may be delayed and deviations from
the forecasts for other consumer categories are possible. The sensitivity
analyses used in the basic forecast are judged to cover the likely range of
possibilities.



- 12 -
Planning
Power sector planning in Jordan is, in general, satisfactory.  The
load forecasts and investment programs are prepared by JEA's Planning
Department with the support of consultants. The load forecasts are also
beiing reviewed and updated in connection with the preparation of the
feasibility study for the new Aqaba steam power station. JEA still depends
largely on external consultants' services for its power system planning and
analyses. Although improvements have been made in the hiring and retaining
of engineering staff in JEA's Planning Department, continuing efforts are
necessary to further develop JEA's own capabilities in these areas. JEA
r,as agreed to take appropriate actions to strengthen its Planning
Leoartment in order to further develop power subsector planning and
analyses capabilities and inform the Bank, not later than December 31,
1981, of actions proposed to be taken to improve these capabilities. JEA
would implement the proposed actions in consultation with the Bank.
1.332    JEPCO also needs to develop its technical and financial planning
capabilities. The existing situation whereby JEPCO relies almost com-
pletely on foreign consultants for these functions is not satisfactory and
basic improvements are needed. JEPCO has agreed to submit to the Bank by
T arch 31, 1982 for its review and comments a plan to develop its technical
and financial planning capabilities, and to implement this plan in
consultation with the Bank.
Generati on
1.33     The Hussein steam power station near Amman, being extended by
three 66-MW units, is expected to be commissioned in 1981 and 1982. Three
5-MW diesel generating units for the Aqaba power station have been ordered
to be put into operation in 1983. With the fourth 66-MW unit for the
Ilussein steam power station, expected to be commissioned in 1984, the final
extension of this station would be completed.  A new steam power station
would be built near Aqaba with an initial installation of 2x120 MW steam
units to be brought into service in 1986. The possible use of residual
iuel oil and imported coal would be studied by the station's engineering
consultants. This station would be connected with the power system through
a 132-kV transmission line Aqaba-Ma'an, which is part of the Project.
Transmission Network
1.fi34   About 315 km of 132-kV transmission lines and 629 MVA in substa-
tion transformer capacities is under construction and is expected to be
completed by 1982, In the period 1983-86, about 518 km of transmission
lines and substations with a capacity of 683 MVA are planned to be con-
structed. The 132-kV transmission line from Ma'an to Aqaba will complete
the transmission link between the Northern, Central and Southern regions to
enable integrated operation of the power system in Jordan. The Jordanian
and Syrian power systems have been connected through a 66-kV transmission
.-ne and Jordan has been importing electricity from Syria. A 230-kV line
from Irbid to Damascus with a lO0-MVA transformer substation at Irbid have
been constructed, which would enable synchroneous operation of the two
power systems. This interconnection has not been brought into operation
due to the current political situation. When put in operation it would



_%,                            - 13 -
enable better utilization of power system generating facilities in both
countries through coordinated operation and maintenance. It would also
improve reliability of power supply by giving the Jordanian power system
access to the much larger generation reserve of the Syrian power system.
Reserve sharing would allow JEA to reduce its generating capacity by about
50 MW which otherwise may be viewed as an idle investment. Jordan plans to
import electricity from Syria in an amount up to 20 GWh annually. There
are no immediate plans for other interconnections between the Jordanian
power system and neighboring systems.
Distribution
1.35     JEA's distribution network expansion, to be implemented in the
period 1981-85, includes about 120 km of overhead lines and 90 MVA in sub-
station transformer capacity. In the period 1980-1984 JEPCO plans to con-
struct 24 transformer substations with an installed capacity of 121 MVA and
install 74 km of cables and 36 km of overhead lines as well as to reinforce
the existing 33-kV network by adding 130 MVA in power transformers capac-
ity, 25.5 km of 33-kV cables and 9 km of 33-kV overhead lines. Further-
more, about 350 new distribution substations will be built in JEPCO's
concession area. JEPCO has also started a program for reinforcing the
urban distribution system by changing the existing distribution system in
the city of Amman from 6.6 kV to 11 kV. IDECO's distribution plans include
reinforcement of the distribution network in the city of Irbid by closing
the 33-kV ring, construction of a new 33/6.6-kV substation and installation
of 6.6-kV underground cables. The distribution networks in Jordan are
designed by experienced foreign consultants and follow the British pattern
and standards.
Rural Electrification
1.36     JEA has prepared a national rural electrification plan covering
all villages to be electrified in the period 1981-1993. At present 261
villages, with a total population of 282,000 are being electrified, and
when completed, 376 villages will be electrified or about 38% of the total
number of villages, representing 84% of the total rural population in
Jordan. The remaining villages will be electrified in the following stages:
Stage                    Number of Villages                  Period
1                                140                     1981-1985
2                                160                     1986-1990
3                                100                     1991-1993
The Project would include about 50 of the villages in Stage 1 (para. 2.02).
With the completion of the third stage, almost all the rural population in
Jordan would have access to the public power supply. About 260 villages
included in the 1979 population census are very small, remote or temporary
settlements. Their inclusion in the rural electrification plan is not con-
sidered to be appropriate at this stage. The Government plays a very active
role in rural electrification and assists in its financing by arranging
foreign loans. It established the Rural Electrification Fund in 1980 for
purposes of providing funds for rural electrification projects (para. 1.11).



- 14 -
1.37     The Governments of Denmark, the UK, the USA and the U66R have pro-
vided financial assistance for rural electrification in Jordan. A loan
agreement was signed with Denmark for the supply of 21 small mobile diesel
generating sets to be installed in remote villages in the Southern region
of Jordan. The UK loan was used to electrify 30 villages in Irbid
District. The US (AID) loan of US$9 million was used for the supply of
materials for electrification of 37 villages and two low cost housing areas
in Amman District. The USSR loan will cover the supply of materials and
supervision of construction works for electrification of 100 villages in
Irbid District and 32 villages in Amman District. Relending of the foreign
loans from the Government to JEPCO and IDECO have been made through JEA.
Development Program Costs
1.38     JEA's total investment in the period 1980-1985 excluding interest
during construction is estimated to be about JD 159 million (US$530 mil-
lion) at late 1980 prices (Annex 1.12). The investment program is
reasonable in relation to the forecast demand to be met. In the past JEA
had no major problems in securing financing for its investment programs.
The Government's contribution and foreign borrowing used to be the main
sources of development program financing. However, the substantial tariff
increases in March 1980 should enable JEA to increase its own internal cash
generation in order to cover about 36% of the investment program. JEPCO's
total investment program in the period 1980-1984 is estimated to be about
JD 33 million (US$L10 million) (Annex 1.13). About 39% of JEPCO's invest-
ment requirements are expected to be financed by internal cash generation,
issues of shares and customers' contributions. The Government has secured
loans for JEPCO from the European Investment Bank (JD 1.7 million), the USA
(JD 2.7 million) and the USSR (JD 1.06 million).  Other foreign borrowings
and local loans, including the proposed Bank loan, are planned to complete
JEPCO's capital investment financing plan. IDECO's development program
cost in the period 1980-1984 is estimated to be about JD 10 milliort (US$33
million). Complete financing has been arranged through self-financing and
shares (33%), Government loans (22%), and loans from the UK (JD 2.3 mil-
lion) and the USSR (JD 2.4 million). The Government regularly reviews the
investment requirernents for the construction programs of entities involved
in power supply activities and undertakes various measures to secure the
necessary financing from external and internal sources.
Role of IDA/Bank
1.39     The World Bank group has made two credits and one loan to the
Government of Jordan for the development of the power subsector. IDA
Credit 386-JO (1973) for US$10.2 million together with an equal amount from
the Kuwait Fund waS used to finance two 33-MW steam power units and one
13-MW gas turbine at the Hussein thermal power station. The power facil-
ities have been corapleted and operate satisfactorily. IDA Credit 570-JO
(1975) for US$5 million with co-financing from the Arab Fund (US$13.4 mil-
lion) was used to f-inance a third 33-MW unit at the Hussein thermal power
station, reconditioning of the Marqa diesel power station and the Southern



- 15-
Jordan Power Development Study. The third unit has been put into commer-
cial operation and Marqa diesel station reconditioned to reach 40-MW
output.  The project completion report for the two credits is under
preparation. Bank Loan 1688-JO in 1979 (US$15 million) is being used to
finance the transmission network and rural electrification. This project
is progressing satisfactorily. The Bank Group lending operations have been
instrumental in establishing JEA and in creating a modern power system in
Jordan. These operations have also played a catalytic role in attracting
investments in the power subsector by both the Kuwait and Arab funds. The
proposed fourth lending operation would enable the Bank to continue and
expand its efforts toward achieving the institution-building objectives
identified in connection with the previous lending. This fourth operation
would also extend Bank's institution-building efforts to the major power
distributor in Jordan (JEPCO). Both JEA and JEPCO need to develop adequate
planning capabilities, strengthen staff training and establish appropriate
accounting systems. Furthermore, the proposed Project would enable the
Bank to assist the Government in connection with the overall energy sector
(para. 1.08). The Government fully appreciates the Bank Group's role and
expects further active Bank involvement in the country's energy sector
development.
II. THE PROJECT
Objectives
2.01     The primary objective of the Project is to provide adequate trans-
mission and distribution network facilities to meet the rapidly growing
power needs in Jordan in the most economic way. Further objectives are:
improved quality of power supply services; extension of the national trans-
mission network; acceleration of the country's rural electrification; con-
tinuation of the institution-building efforts to develop both JEA and JEPCO
as autonomous, technically competent and financially viable entities; and
assistance to the Jordanian authorities in the development of the country's
energy sector.
Description
2.02     The Project would comprise parts of the network development pro-
grams of JEA and JEPCO to be implemented during the period 1981-84. The
Project consists of the following components:
(a) JEA
(i) About 160 km of 132-kV transmission lines to connect Aqaba,
Quweira, East Ghor, Ashrafiya and Sahab with the national
transmission network;



- 16 -
(ii)  extension and reinforcement of transformer substations at
Irbid, Bayader, Hussein Power Station, Amman South and Ma'an,
and construction of transformer substations at East Ghor,
Ashr.afiya, Sahab, Quweira and Aqaba, with a total transformer
installed capacity of 619 MVA;
(iii) electrification of about 30 villages near Karak, Tafilah,
Shoubak, Ma'an and Wadi Musa;
(iv)  consultants services; and
(v) staff training.
(b) JEPCO
(i) extension of the urban distribution network, including about
13 km of 33-kV overhead lines, about 43 km of 33-kV cables,
about 140 MVA of 33/11-kV power transformers, equipment and
materials for about 120 distribution substations (11/0.4 kV),
upgrading the existing 6-kV distribution network to ll-kV
and related auxiliaries;
(ii)  electrification of about 20 villages around Amman;
(iii) power supply to three low cost housing developments;
(iv)  consultants services;
(v) organization and management review (para. 1.21); and
(vi)  staff training.
(c) Energy Department (MIT)
Consultants services in connection with the country's energy
sector development and pricing policy (para. 1.08).
A detailed description of physical components of the Project is given in
Annex 2.1.
Training Programs
2.03     JEA has prepared a staff training plan covering the authority's
needs in the period 1980-1983 (para. 1.18).  The Project includes training
of 15 of JEA's managerial, technical, financial and administrative staff.
The timely implementation of this plan is very important for continuing
improvements in JEA's services. JEA has agreed to begin implementation by
September 1, 1981 of the staff training plan agreed with the Bank in
accordance with an implementation schedule satisfactory to the Bank.



- 17 -
2.04     Over the past few years, a training program has been set up by
JEPCO in cooperation with the Ministry of Education. At present the pro-
gram is geared toward the training of skilled persons in overhead line
construction, cable laying and jointing, and the installation of switchgear
and associated equipment. The training program needs to be expanded to
include engineering, accounting and managerial staff. Under the proposed
loan foreign exchange costs for training of six of JEPCO's staff in modern
financial and managerial practices would be financed. JEPCO has agreed to
submit to the Bank not later than December 31, 1981 a detailed staff
training program and to implement the agreed program in accordance with an
implementation schedule satisfactory to the Bank.
Consultants Services
2.05     JEA has engaged the services of Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR) of
the UK as consultants to prepare the feasibility study of its part of the
Project. JEA's Planning Department has also participated actively in the
feasibility study. The document entitled "Jordan Transmission Development
Plan up to the Year 2000" demonstrates the Project's feasibility and
economic justification.  The rural electrification components, both JEA's
and JEPCO's parts, are covered in the document entitled "Amman and South
Rural Electrification 1981-1983". The consultants have investigated line
routes and substations' sites and started drafting bidding documents for
contracts to be financed by the proposed loan. JEA needs about 135
manmonths of consultants' assistance in procurement, supervision of
construction, erection and inspection of Project's works and equipment.
JEA has agreed to continue to employ consultants, whose qualifications,
experience and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank,
for engineering services, procurement and supervision of its part of the
Project.
2.06     JEPCO has contracted the services of Kennedy & Donkin (K&D) of the
UK for its part of the Project. The consultant has prepared a detailed
capital investment program covering the period 1980-1984. K&D maintains a
permanent resident engineer at JEPCO's headquarters and actively assists in
all Project-related activities. Detailed designs for urban distribution
extensions, low cost housing power supply and rural electrification have
been prepared. JEPCO plans to entrust K&D with the preparation of bidding
documents for contracts to be financed from the proposed loan.  JEPCO needs
about 100 manmonths of consultants' assistance in procurement, supervision
of construction and inspection of distribution equipment. Furthermore,
about 25 manmonths of consultants services is required for the JEPCO's
organization and management review (para. 1.21). JEPCO has agreed to
employ consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank for engineering
services, procurement and supervision of its part of the Project.
2.07     The objective of the provision of consultants services for the
energy sector is to review and analyze energy sector data and prepare the
methodology to aid, inter alia, the Government in decision-making on energy
pricing, demand management, energy conservation and indigenous energy
resources development. Appropriate technical assistance would also be



- 18 -
provided to Jordanian authorities and institutions in matters related to
energy sector development, organization and activities. About 40 manmonths
of consultants' assistance would be required for the energy sector services.
Project Cost Estimate
2.08     The estimated cost of the Project, excluding interest during con-
struction, is US$81.12 million equivalent, of which US$51.72 million would
be in foreign exchange, based on the exchange rates of U6$1 = JD 0.3.

2.09     Base costs are in mid 1981 prices.  Cost estimates were developed
by the consultants, on the basis of the cost of the recently signed
contracts for the same kind of works and equipment in Jordan. The foreign
costs quoted represent the total foreign exchange cost of works and goods
purchased both from abroad and locally. The Project goods and works are



- 19 -
exempt from import duties and taxes. Physical contingencies have been
estimated at about 7% for civil works and 5% for equipment and materials.
The rather low physical contingencies reflect the nature of the Project;
i.e. the extension and reinforcement of existing facilities, and the
advanced stage of Project preparation. The price contingencies have been
calculated at the following annual rates for both foreign and local costs,
which are considered reasonable for Jordan:
Years                                    Percentage (%)

1983-1985                                         7.5
About 300 manmonths of consultants' services for the energy sector, JEPCO's
organization and management study, engineering, procurement and supervision
are required at an estimated cost of US$11,500 per manmonth, including all
expenses.
Project Financing Plan
2.10   The Project costs and interest during construction, which is
estimated at US$5.46 million, are expected to be financed as follows:

- 20 -
2.11     Part of t:he Project financing is expected to be forthcoming from
the Kuwait Fund which has agreed, in principle, to provide a loan of about
KD 5 million (US$L8 million equivalent) to the Government earmarked for the
JEA's Project component. Two large consumers, JVA and the Sahab industrial
Estate, have agreed to contribute US$5 million and US$2 million
respectively for l:he Project, which would provide them with a bulk power
supply. The remaining foreign exchange needed to complete the Project
would be secured by the Government. The consultants services for the
energy sector would be financed out of the Government's fund specifically
established for the financing of studies. The Project financing
arrangements are satisfactory.
2.12     The proposed Bank loan of US$25 million would be made to the
Government, which coordinates all foreign financing for public sector
projects through its National Planning Council, on standard Bank terms
applicable to Jordan; 17 years, including 4 years' grace period. About
65,000 people living in 50 villages and three low cost housing estates will
benefit from the favorable Bank loan terms. The Government would onlend
USt5 million to JEA and US$20 million to JEPCO on the same terms as the
Bank loan under s.eparate subsidiary loan agreements. JEA and JEPCO would
each bear the foreign exchange risk on its portion of the loan. As a
condition of loan effectiveness, the borrower and beneficiaries shall be
required to execute subsidiary loan agreements on onlending arrangements
between Government, JEA and JEPCO. The loan is expected to become
effective within three months of signing.
Implementation
2.13     JEA and JEPCO would be responsible for implementing their portions
of the Project by contracts (except civil works of JEPCO's urban distribu-
tion, which would be undertaken by force account) and would use
consultants' services to handle the engineering, supervision, quality
control and inspection of works and equipment. Both JEA and JEPCO have the
required experience in carrying out transmission, distribution and rural
electrification projects. They are also properly staffed and equipped for
this kind of work. The Energy Department (MIT) would be responsible for
consultants activities related to the energy sector. The Department is
capable of carrying out these activities. The Project would be implemented
during the four-year period (1981-1984) according to the JEA and JEPCO's
implementation schedules given in Annexes 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. The
implementation programs and schedules are reasonable; no specific problems
are expected in acquiring rights-of-way and sites for Project's
facilities. Necessary preparations for the Project's implementation have
been already undertaken. Experience with the implementation of the
previous transmission and rural electrification projects has been found
very satisfactory.



- 21 -
Procurement
2.14     Procurement for works and goods to be financed by the proposed
Bank loan (other than consultants' services and training) would be through
international competitive bidding under the Bank Group Guidelines for Pro-
curement. Bidding documents for equipment and works are being prepared by
the consultants. The JEA's component of rural electrification would be
partially financed by the proposed loan. The transmission network would be
financed by the Kuwait Fund. JEPCO would group its purchases into the
following contracts: 33-kV overhead lines; 33-kV cables; 11-kV cables and
auxiliaries; outdoor 33-kV switchgear; power transformers; equipment
needed for upgrading the existing 6-kV distribution network to 11-kV; rural
electrification; and the distribution network for low cost housing.
Construction of urban distribution facilities will be carried out by
JEPCO's construction department, which is well organized and equipped.
Materials and erection works for rural electrification (both JEA and JEPCO)
would be contracted separately. The above grouping arrangements would
ensure effective international competition for procurement of goods and
works required for the Project. Increased local participation is expected
in contracts related to construction and erection works. Moreover,
manufacturing of some local equipment for rural electrification and
distribution networks is likely, and a preference of 15% or actual import
duties, whichever is less, would be granted to local manufacturers in order
to encourage their participation.
Disbursements
2.15     The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed to cover (i)
100% of foreign expenditures or 100% of local ex-factory costs of goods
manufactured in Jordan for rural electrification, urban distribution, and
the low cost housing power supply network; and (ii) 100% of the foreign
exchange costs of consultants services and training. The expected
disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 2.5. The loan closing date would
be December 31, 1985 to allow for payment of retention money.
2.16     In order to expedite the implementation of the Project, the
assistance of consultants in the preparation of procurement documents is
required. Consultants services for the energy sector are also expected to
start before the proposed loan is signed. Therefore, retroactive financing
would be provided for foreign expenditures required for the consultants
services incurred after January 1, 1981, but before loan signing. The
total retroactive financing would not exceed US$400,000.
Environmental Aspects and Project Risks
2.17     The Project will have no adverse effects on the environment.
The transmission lines will cross desert and mountainous areas with few
permanent inhabitants and little agricultural activity. In view of the
previous experience it is expected that fair agreements on indemnification
will be reached with all affected property owners. JEA and JEPCO are
paying appropriate attention to the aesthetic appearance of transmission



- 22 -
and distribution facilities and their compatibility with the environment.
Possible adverse visual impact will be reduced to a minimum by the careful
selection of types of transmission line poles, including an aesthetic
tubular steel pole design near cities of Amman and Aqaba, and by suitable
routing of overhead lines. The social environment will be bettered by
bringing public lighting to rural areas which have not yet had power
supply. No special Project risks are expected.

III. FINANCE
A. Jordan Electricity Authority
Accounting
3.01     As required under Loan 1688-J0, JEA has satisfactorily implemented
the accounting system recommended by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., the
consultants appointed under the first IDA Credit of 1973. It has computer-
ized its accounting work and now prepares monthly accounts usually within
15 days after the end of the month. However, it still needs to recruit
additional qualified accounting staff and to provide accounting training to
its staff to ensure that the system continues to be implemented efficiently
(see para. 2.03 on JEA's training needs).
Revaluation of Assets
3.02     Loan 1688-JO requires JEA to earn a minimum 9% rate of return on
revalued assets from 1981 onwards. Revaluation is to be carried out using
indices reflecting the changes in the prices of local and imported
equipment and materials. JEA was required to propose and reach agreement
with the Bank on indices for revaluation by March 31, 1980, to determine
the current value of the assets in service as of December 31, 1981 at the
latest using the agreed indices, and thereafter to revalue its assets as of
the end of the year in which the agreed indices increase by 15% over the
level at which the assets were last revalued. JEA has not formulated any
indices for revaluation.
3.03     JEA has argued that since the book values of many of its assets
(e.g., Marqa power station) are higher than their current costs, applica-
tion of the revaluation indices to its present asset base without an
assessment of the value of the assets would tend to inflate and distort the
asset base leading to unjustifiably high tariffs. Accordingly, JEA con-
siders that an engineering valuation of its fixed assets as of end-1980, to
start with, to determine their current costs, to be followed by subsequent
periodic revaluations also on the basis of engineering valuations at inter-
vals of say, four or five years, would be more appropriate than a revalua-
tion based on annual coefficients. Apart from this, Government and JEA
have also expressed concern that the revaluation of JEA's assets based on
annual coefficients might induce other institutions in the country to
insist on revaluing their own assets which would exacerbate inflationary
pressures in the economy. Having regard to these concerns of Government
and JEA, the Bank has reviewed with Government and JEA the question of
substituting a cash generation covenant for the rate of return covenant
that would have substantially the same objective of adequate cost recovery
and generation of internal funds for meeting a reasonable portion of the
resources needed for future investments. The matter is discussed further
in paras. 3.09 and 3.10.

Accounts Receivable
3.04     JEA's billing operations are centralized except for some rural
consumers in remote areas where the billing is the responsibility of the
local offices. Its accounts receivable for electricity supply reflect an
average of about 6 weeks' billings, which is acceptable. JEA has adequate
legal remedies to deal with defaulting customers including distribution
entities, since the law permits JEA to discontinue the supply of elec-
tricity to any defaulting consumer, or to revoke the license of a distri-
bution entity which is in breach of its charter or of the law.
Past Performance and Present Position
3.05     JEA's actual income statements, sources and applications of funds
statements, and balance sheets for the years 1977 through 1979, and the
estimates for 1980 are given in Annex 3.1. JEA's net fixed assets have
grown from a mere three quarter million JD in 1975 to about JD 42 million
in 1980. It has also improved in efficiency of operation as can be seen
from the improvement in the ratio of kWh generated/employee from 420,000
kWh/employee in 1977 to 600,000 kWh/employee in 1980.  It achieved rates of
return of 6.1% in 1977, 4.8% in 1978 and 4.6% in 1979 on unrevalued assets
as against the minimum 9% required under the existing covenant under
Credits 386-JO and 570-JO and Loan 1688-JO. However, as the internal cash
generation during the 3-year period averaged 24% of the construction
requirements, the basic objective of the covenant was met. Therefore, the
Bank has accepted this performance as satisfactory. With the significant
tariff increase of March 1980 (para. 1.12), JEA was in compliance with the
rate of return covenant in 1980.
3.06     JEA's financial condition has been satisfactory.  With a debt/
equity ratio of 44/56 for 1978, 42/58 for 1979 and 41/59 for 1980, and a
debt service coverage of 1.2 in 1978, 1.5 in 1979 and 3.0 in 1980, its cash
flow has been adequate to cover the debt service requirements. The current
ratio has been 2.0 in 1978, 4.7 in 1979 and 5.0 in 1980 reflecting a
comfortable liquidity position.

3.08     JEA's investment program for 1981-85 will require about JD 166
million (US$553 million) which is expected to be financed 26% from internal
sources, 18% from Government equity contributions, and 56% from borrow-
ings. After allow*ing for debt service but excluding a provision for
increase in working capital, the internal cash generation would be about
31% of the programr requirements, which is satisfactory. The proposed
Borrowings (56% of requirements) would consist of: (i) the loans already
committed--23%; (ii) the proposed Bank loan for the Project--l%; (iii) a
loan from the Kuwait Fund--3%; and (iv) the future loans for Aqaba Steam
Station and other future projects--29%. Since financing for about 71% of
the program has been identified and many bilateral/international agencies
including the Bank have expressed interest in participating in the future
major projects, such as the Aqaba Power Station, the financing plan should
be considered realistic.
Future Financial Performance and Proposed Financial Covenant
3.09     JEA's ability to generate funds internally for expansion during
the years beginning with 1981 is dependent on a variety of factors affect-
ing its operating costs and revenues such as wages and salaries, fuel
costs, efficiency of the use of electricity by large industrial consumers,
structure and level of tariffs, capitalization, etc., many of which are
outside JEA's control. The following past actions or likely future actions
are especially relevant in determining the appropriate levels of cash
generation by JEA:
(a)  the 50% fuel price increase approved by Government from February
1981 to raise domestic prices of petroleum products to parity with
internatiDnal prices, raising JEA's operating expenses in 1981 by
27% in one quantum jump;
(b)  possible fuel price increases in future years in line with Govern-
ment's intention to keep pace with international prices; and
(c)  Government's decision, in view of the already high level of
electricity tariffs in Jordan, not to let JEA pass on to the
consumers in 1981, through the fuel adjustment clause, the fuel
cost increase of February, resulting in a significant erosion of
JEA's earnings in 1981.
In order to improve its earnings, JEA has proposed to Government that it be
allowed to retain as its revenue the Fils 1.0 per kWh that is presently
collected by JEA for the Rural Electrification Fund and the Fils 1.0 per
kWh collected as taxes and passed on to Government, to partially offset the
Fils 5.0 per kWh in additional operating expenses that would be incurred by
JEA because of the 50% increase in fuel prices. Should the Government not
approve the above mneasures, then alternative measures would be implemented
to ensure that JEA obtains additional revenues at least equal to the amount
that would have accrued to it through the charge of Fils 2.0 per kWh. Two



- 27 -
other measures are contemplated by Government and JEA to achieve opera-
tional economies in the power subsector and to strengthen JEA and its
finances. JEA is planning a review of its tariffs by the end of July 1981
which might lead to a general restructuring of tariffs. The second measure
envisaged by Government is a study of the efficiency of use of electricity
by large industrial consumers such as cement, refineries and new incoming
industries including the possibility of co-generation so that maximum
economies in operation could be achieved.
3.10     Having regard to the foregoing and the need to avoid abrupt and
drastic price adjustments that would be disruptive socially and eco-
nomically, agreement was reached with Government and JEA on the following
financial objectives for JEA, assuming a real increase in petroleum
products prices of 3% per annum in 1982-1985:
(a) JEA would achieve cash generation levels of at least 25% in 1981,
1982 and 1983 and at least 35% in 1984 and thereafter. The level
of cash generation for a year would be computed on the average of
the construction expenditures for that year and the next preceding
year. Based on these cash generation levels, JEA's internal cash
generation in 1981-1985 is estimated to be an acceptable 31% of
investment requirements;
(b) since there is some uncertainty about the timing of various
measures planned for 1981, a shortfall in the level of cash
generation is possible and, therefore, JEA and Government have
agreed that any shortfall in cash generation in 1981 would be made
up in 1982; and
(c) the Government and JEA would review at least three months before
the end of each fiscal year the adequacy of JEA's revenues to
achieve, on the basis of a realistic forecast, the agreed cash
generation level for the following fiscal year. On the basis of
this review, the Government and JEA would determine the measures
required to achieve the agreed cash generation level, consult with
the Bank on these measures and on the implementation schedule for
these measures before the beginning of the following fiscal year.
In order to achieve the above levels of cash generation, the Government and
JEA would take appropriate measures including restructuring of tariffs to
increase the average revenue/kWh sold by 11% in 1982, 15% in 1983, 6% in
1984 and 14% in 1985.
3.11     The forecast income statements, sources and applications of funds
statements and balance sheets for the years 1981-85 at current costs are
given in Annex 3.1. The assumptions relating to the forecasts are included
in Annex 3.3. With the last tariff increase of March 1980 (para. 1.12),
JEA would be able to achieve a return of 11.6% on revalued assets in 1981.
Assuming annual tariff increases to achieve the proposed levels of cash
generation (para. 3.10) its rate of return on revalued assets is esti-
mated to be 7.6% in 1982 gradually increasing to 8.9% in 1985, which is
acceptable.



- 28 -
3.12     During the forecast period JEA's debt/equity ratic of between
37/63 and 50/50 for its direct debt and the ratio of between 41/59 and
54/46 for the total debt reflect an acceptable equity base. During this
period the current ratio would be between 3.8 and 10.6, reflecting a
comfortable liquidity position.
Debt bervice Coverage
3.13     The existing debt service covenant under Loan 1688-JO provides
that JEA shall not incur any debt without prior approval of the Bank,
unless its net revenues for the fiscal year next preceding the date of such
incurrence, or for any later twelve-month period ended prior to the date of
such incurrence, shall not be less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service
requirement in any succeeding fiscal year (including the fiscal year in
which such debt is to be incurred) on all debt including the debt to be
incurred.  Under this covenant, JEA's debt service cover-age ratio at least
in this decade would be below 1.5 since JEA is a growing organization with
ever-increasing debt and debt service requirements. This would mean that
JEA would have to seek the Bank's approval constantly before resorting to
long-term borrowing. Under this circumstance it would be more appropriate
to revise the debt; service covenant to require JEA to obtain the Bank's
prior approval for any new long-term borrowing unless the net revenue for
each year during the term of the debt (before depreciation and interest) is
at least equal to 1.5 times the projected debt service requirement for such
year, on all its debt, including the debt to be incurred. Based on the
above, JEA's debt service coverage ratio during 1981-1985 is projected to
be between 1.8 and 2.4, which is satisfactory. JEA has agreed to include
the above covenant in the proposed loan in place of the existing covenant
under Loan 1688-JO and Credits 386-JO and 570-JO.
Auditing
3.14     The accounts of JEA are audited annually by auditors appointed by
the Board in accordance with the General Electricity Law. Shair & Co., a
local firm of chartered accountants, has been appointed by the Board for
this purpose. The auditing arrangements are satisfactory. The existing
audit covenant in Loan 1688-JO would be repeated in the proposed loan.
Insurance
3.15     JEA's purchases from abroad are covered during the construction
period by insurance provided by the contractors. Insurance coverage for
its assets in operation is provided through private local insurance
companies operating under government regulations to cover the usual risks.
These arrangements for insurance are acceptable. Also under Loan 1688-JO,
JEA has covenanted to have qualified inspectors make annual inspection of
its boiler and generating equipment to comply with sound public utility
practices. This covenant would be repeated in the proposed loan.

B. Jordanian Electric Power Company
Accounting
3.16     JEPCO does not have a separate department for accounting/financial
management. It has only an accounting section responsible for keeping the
books. The chief accountant and his deputy have reached their respective
positions through long years of service in the Company. They have no
formal qualification either in accounting or in financial management. The
section, however, has five university graduates, although only two of them
have a degree in accounting. There is ample scope for improving the
quality of the financial and accounting staff and the accounting section's
operating methods to be in line with current utility practices. Its finan-
cial planning is handled by its consultants, Kennedy and Donkin of the
U.K. There is a need to start a well designed training program for the
existing staff and to review its hiring policy with a view to hiring and
retaining appropriately qualified and experienced senior level staff who
could gradually assume the planning functions now being handled by the
consultants. The terms of reference for the consultants proposed for
reviewing JEPCO's organizational structure (see para. 1.21) would also
include a review of these aspects.
Past Performance and Present Position
3.17     JEPCO's actual income statements, sources and applications of
funds statements, and balance sheets for the years 1977 through 1979, and
the estimates for 1980 are given in Annex 3.2. JEPCO's concession
agreement provides that (i) dividends shall not be less than 7 1/2% of the
nominal value of the shares (calculated on the basis of intervals of five
years, each starting from April 1, 1963); and (ii) if a tariff increase
were to be approved by the Government in order to meet the above minimum
dividend then the increase shall be such as to restrict the profit
including income tax to not more than 16% of the nominal value of the
shares. Any profit earned in excess of 16% will have to be transferred to
a voluntary reserve account. JEPCO has always set its financial goals
within the framework of the above provisions in the concession agreement.
3.18     JEPCO's past financial performance has been satisfactory.  During
1977-79, JEPCO had a sales growth of about 21% p.a. Its pretax rate of
return on assets valued at historical costs has been between 10.4% and
12.9% between 1977 and 1979 as compared to 4.6 to 6.1 achieved by JEA
during the same period. However, its return during this period after a
38.5% corporate tax has been between 5% and 7.3%. During 1977-79 its
average net internal cash generation after debt service has been sufficient
to meet about 30% of its construction requirements. Its debt/equity ratio
which has been between 22/78 and 29/71 during 1977-79 indicates a sound
equity base, particularly since the assets are being recorded at historical
costs. However, JEPCO has been carrying large accounts payables in its
books resulting in a low current ratio. JEPCO expects to improve this
situation through better working capital management.



- 30 -
Accounts Receivable
3.19     Government departments have been slack in paying JEPCO's bills for
electricity supply with the result that JEPCO's accounts receivables were
the equivalent of 78 and 58 days' supply at 1978-end and 1979-end
respectively. However, as a result of the strenuous efforts made by JEPCO
and the Government departments, the overdue payments were significantly
reduced by the end of 1980. In order to ensure that delayed payment of
bills by Government: departments may not be a continuing problem, Government
would cause all its departments and agencies to pay all outstanding
electricity bills by September 1, 1981 and thereafter to pay all current
bills within six weeks of their issuance by JEPCO. As regards domestic
customers, JEPCO has taken steps to safeguard its interests against
defaults on their part by raising the level of customer deposits for new
customers to two months' estimated consumption and already about 30% of
JEPCO's domestic customers furnish such deposits. As regards the remaining
70%, JEPCO would gradually increase their deposits also over the Project
period from the existing level of one month's estimated consumption to two
months' estimated consumption. The Government concurs with this approach.
Non-payment of electricity bills by JEPCO's customers is not expected to be
a problem in the future.

3.21     About 70% of the construction program is proposed to be financed
through borrowings of about JD 25.4 million, which includes committed loans
of about JD 4.4 million (12%), the proposed Bank loan of about JD 6 mil-
lion (17%), and unidentified loans of about JD 15 million (41%). A third
of the unidentified portion of the total borrowing assumed relates to its
1985 construction requirements. JEPCO is expected to be able to identify
these sources when it updates the current four-year financing plan.
Internal sources after providing for some working capital increase are
expected to provide a total of 25% of the requirements. To meet part of
its capital expenditure requirements, JEPCO sold to JEA in March 1981 one
million new shares at the face value of 1 JD plus a premium of 0.75 JD per
share. This equity capital of JD 1.75 million (U05.8 million) would cover
about 5% of its program requirements.
Future Performance
3.22     The forecast income statements and balance sheets for the years
1981-85 at historical costs and another set of forecasts at current costs
are given in Annex 3.2. Assumptions relating to the forecasts are included
in Annex 3.3. The 1980 tariff revision reduced JEPCO's net earnings by 5%
and increased its operating ratio slightly from 91% in 1979 to 93% in
1980. This was due to a substantial increase in the cost of purchased
energy (87%), only partly offset (51%) by increased sales revenue.
However, the tariff increases that the Government will have to approve to
enable JEPCO comply with the proposed cash generation covenant (para. 3.24)
should help to raise JEPCO's net earnings in 1982 and thereafter. With
these tariff increases it is estimated that the pretax rate of return would
be between 9.6% and 15.8% on unrevalued assets in 1981-1985 (between 6.6%
and 12.4% on revalued assets), which is acceptable.
3.23     During the forecast period, JEPCO's debt/equity ratio would be
between 39/61 and 56/44, and its earnings per share would be between 17%
and 34% of the nominal value of the shares. Assuming that the government
departments would be paying their bills promptly the accounts receivables
are projected to be not more than 30-day sales in the future. During 1981
and 1982, the current ratio is expected to be only 0.6 but with the pro-
posed increase in customer deposits (para. 3.19), the current ratio would
improve to 0.7 in 1983, 0.9 in 1984 and 1.0 in 1985 (see Annex 3.2,
page 4). Although the ratio during the early part of the Project period,
1981-83, would appear to be low, it does not reflect an unsatisfactory
condition because the current liabilities include (i) large customer
deposits which normally are not returned within a specified period and
(ii) accrued taxes which fall due for payment only a few months after the
close of the fiscal year when the tax assessment is completed. Excluding
customer deposits, the current ratio would be 0.96 in 1981 and 1.03 in
1982, 1.26 in 1983, 1.72 in 1984 and 1.85 in 1985.

3.24      In line with the Bank objective of ensuring that consumers pay a
reasonable proportion of system expansion costs, JEPCO would be required to
mobilize a reasonable part of its investment program. This is proposed to
be achieved by requiring it to generate at least 25% of construction
requirements in 1982 and 1983 and at least 35% in 1984 and thereafter. The
level of cash getneration will be computed after dividend payments, based on
the average of the construction expenditures during the next preceding and
current years. Government and JEPCO have agreed to appropriately adjust
JEPCO's tariffs, as and when necessary, to enable JEPCO to achieve the
above self-financing levels. This would require tariff increases of 10.9%
in 1982, 13.7% in 1983 and 6.5% in 1985. The Government and JEPCO have
further agreed that they will review at least three months before the end
of each fiscal year, the adequacy of JEPCO's revenues to achieve, on the
basis of a realistic forecast, the agreed self-financing ratio for the
following fiscal year. On the basis of this review, the Government and
JEPCO will determine the measures required to achieve this ratio, consult
with the Bank on these measures and on the implementation schedule for
these measures before the beginning of the following fiscal year.
Debt Service Coverage
3.25      During the forecast period the debt service coverage ratio is
projected to be between 1.8 and 2.4, which is satisfactory.  JEPCO has
agreed that it will not incur any debt without prior approval of the Bank,
unless its net revenues (before depreciation and interest) less proposed
dividend for each year during the term of the debt is at least equal to 1.5
times the projected debt service requirement for such year, on all its
debt, including the debt to be incurred.
Auditing
3.26      The accounts of JEPCO are audited annually by auditors appointed
each year by the shareholders during their annual meeting in accordance
with the Company's Articles of Association. Khadder, Ramadan & Co., a
local firm of chartered accountants, has been appointed by the Company for
this purpose. The auditing arrangements are satisfactory. JEPCO has
agreed that independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank will be appointed
to audit its acccunts, and that it will submit to the Bank audited
financial statements and the audit report for a year, not later than four
months after the end of the year.



- 33 -
Insurance
3.27     JEPCO's purchases from abroad are covered during the construction
period by insurance provided by the contractors. Insurance coverage for
its assets in operation is provided for JEPCO through private local
insurance companies operating under government regulations to cover all the
risks that are inherent in operating an electricity distribution system.
These arrangements for insurance coverage are satisfactory. JEPCO has
agreed to continue to maintain with responsible insurers, or make other
provisions satisfactory to the Bank for insurance against such risks and in
such amounts as shall be consistent with sound utility practice.
IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. The Power Market Growth
4.01     The proposed Project will form part of the power development pro-
gram which is designed to meet the continued growth of demand on the inter-
connected power system in Jordan.  The trend growth rate of electricity
consumption since 1971 has been 18% p.a., which is projected to increase to
21% p.a. in the period 1980-85 (para. 1.25).  The current projection of the
load growth to 1985 is shown in Annex 1.10.  For the period 1986-2000, the
estimated power market requirements are as follow:
1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1995   2000
Required Generation
(GWh)                 3,010  3,310  3,703  4,300  4,598  6,170  8,510
The load growth forecast, prepared by the consultants (PCR) and JEA, is
reasonable.  The high load growth rates are caused by country's rapid
electrification, and large industrial, mining, water pumping and other
developments (potash complex, fertilizers, phosphates, water pumping,
industrial estates, etc.). There are clearly many uncertainties in making
projections for long periods, and sensitivity analyses have been undertaken
to determine the impact of a slower load growth than that used for the
basic "most probable" forecast. Because of the fragmented nature of the
Project, which includes the works and equipment for seven physically
non-related items (see details in para. 2.02) individual load forecasts
which are directly applicable to each item of the Project were used for
their economic justification. Since the Project forms only a small part of
a large country's power subsector development program, an overall test has
been made by examining the "time slice" of all projects commissioned in the
Jordan power subsector in the period 1981-1985.



- 34 -
B. Comparison of Alternatives
4.02     Least-cost solutions between the different technical alternatives
have been determined by consultants for all Project items except for
reinforcing the 132-kV Amman ring and for extending the JEPCO urban distri-
bution system, for which there are no realistic technical alternatives, and
solutions proposed by JEA and JEPCO, based on consultants' studies, are
considered to be cost effective. Both JEA and JEPCO consultants have made
very detailed and well documented least-cost analyses for the Ma'an-Aqaba
132-kV transmission line, East Ghor water pumping load power supply, elec-
trification of villages and low cost housing power supply. The cost
streams associated with the different technical alternatives were derived;
the main variables being investment and fuel costs and load growth. The
least-cost solutions were tested for sensitivity to the assumed changes in
the main variables and the obtained results indicated that the choice of
the proposed solutions in not affected by these changes (details of calcu-
lations are available in the Project File).
C. Return on Investment
4.03     The Project involves two major distinct components; the expansion
and reinforcement of the transmission and distribution networks to ensure
that the electricity generated in the future would be delivered to
consumers, and a riral electrification component which would provide public
electricity service to about 50 villages. Both components are an integral
part of the least-cost program for the development of the power subsector
in Jordan. However, the calculation of the return on each component would
not be appropriate because the benefits associated with the first component
cannot be separated from the benefits of the entire program. Therefore,
two rates of return were calculated: the return on the program for the
development of Jordan's power subsector between 1981-1985 and the return on
the rural electrification component.
4.04     The return on the 1981-1985 program is about 21%.  In the
calculation of this return, the incremental revenues were assumed to be the
only benefit associated with the development program. The incremental
revenues are based on the prevailing tariffs which were taken as a proxy
for the customers' willingness to pay (Annex 1.2). The costs encompass the
capital cost for the generation, transmission and distribution facilities,
and the cost of operating and maintaining these facilities. Only the fuel
cost and the foreign part of the capital cost were expressed in terms of
their border prices, the rest of the costs and the benefits, were not
converted to their equivalent border values because conversion factors for
Jordan have not yet been derived. The relatively high return on the
investment reflects the fact that electricity tariffs exceed the long run
marginal cost, which supports the statement made earlier about the success
of the existing tariffs in conveying to consumers the economic cost of the
resources used in meeting their demand for electricity (para. 1.12).
Details of calculation are given in Annex 4.1.



- 35 -
4.05     The return on the rural electrification component of the Project,
based on the quantifiable benefits and costs, is about 9%. Sensitivity
tests have shown that the rate would be about one percentage point lower if
capital costs are valued 20% higher. The quantifiable benefits consists
of: (i) the revenues from the sale of electricity to the beneficiaries
which include the tariff revenues and the customer connection charges; (ii)
the net savings to the beneficiaries resulting from the substitution of
electricity for the other fuel presently being used. The revenues are
based on the existing tariffs which are taken as proxy for the consumers'
willingness to pay. The net savings, used as a proxy for lack of a better
measure, are estimated by taking the difference between the consumers'
average expenditure on alternative sources of energy other than electricity
and the expected average bill for electricity to be supplied by the
Project. The costs are comprised of the economic cost of electricity
delivered to the low voltage distribution network and the cost of the
distribution equipment. Although the rate of return on the rural
electrification component underestimates the real return associated with
such schemes, it is in line with the opportunity cost of capital of about
10% because the tariffs for sale to the beneficiaries are almost at parity
with the economic cost of supply. (Details of calculations are available
in the Project File).

V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     The Government has agreed:
(a)  to submit by June 30, 1982 to the Bank for its review and
comments a plan for (i) strengthening the planning and
management of the energy sector, and (ii) improving the
coordination among the energy-related institutions in Jordan
(para. 1.03);
(b)  to employ by December 31, 1981 qualified and experienced
energy consultants to assist the Government in
decision-making on energy pricing, demand management, energy
conservation and strategy for indigenous resources
development. Jordanian energy-related authorities and
institutions would be adequately involved in this work. The
Government would furnish to the Bank by December 31, 1982 a
timetable, satisfactory to the Bank, of actions to be
undertaken to implement such recommendations of the energy
consultants as are appropriate (para. 1.08); and
(c)  to cause its departments and agencies to pay their
electricity bills by September 1, 1981 and thereafter to pay
all current bills within six weeks of their issuance by JEPCO
(para.. 3.19).
5.02     The Goverrment and JEA have agreed to include the following cash
generation covenant in the proposed loan in place of the existing rate of
return covenant under Loan 1688-JO and Credits 386-JO and 570-JO. Govern-
ment and JEA will appropriately adjust JEA's tariffs, as and when
necessary, to enable JEA to maintain a self-financing ratio of at least 25%
in 1981, 1982 and 1983 and at least 35% in 1984 and thereafter, based on
its average capital expenditures for electricity operations for two years
comprising the year in question and the next preceding year. Any possible
shortfall in cash generation in 1981 would be made up in 1982. Further-
more, they will (i) review at least three months before the end of each
fiscal year, the adequacy of JEA's revenues to produce, on the basis of a
realistic forecast, the agreed self-financing ratio for the following
fiscal year, and (ii) determine measures required to achieve the agreed
ratio, consult with the Bank on these measures and on the implementation
schedule for these measures before the beginning of the following fiscal
year (para. 3.10).
5.03     The Government and JEPCO have agreed to appropriately adjust
JEPCO's tariffs, as and when necessary, to enable JEPCO to maintain a
self-financing ratio of at least 25% after dividend payments in 1982 and
1983 and at least 35% in 1984 and thereafter, based on its average capital
expenditures for electricity operations for two years comprising the
year in question and the next preceding year. Furthermore, they will
(i) review at least three months before the end of each fiscal year, the



- 37 -
adequacy of JEPCO's revenues to produce, on the basis of a realistic
forecast, the agreed self-financing ratio for the following fiscal year and
(ii) determine measures required to achieve the agreed ratio, consult with
the Bank on these measures and on the implementation schedule for these
measures before the beginning of the following fiscal year (para. 3.24).
5.04     JEA has agreed:
(a)  to take appropriate actions to strengthen its Planning Department
in order to further develop power subsector planning and analyses
capabilities and inform the Bank, not later than December 31,
1981, of actions proposed to be taken to improve these
capabilities. JEA would promptly implement the proposed actions
in consultation with the Bank (para. 1.31);
(b)  to begin implementation by September 1, 1981 of the staff training
plan agreed with the Bank in accordance with an implementation
schedule satisfactory to the Bank (para. 2.03);
(c)  to continue to employ consultants, whose qualifications,
experience and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to
the Bank, for engineering services, procurement and supervision of
its part of the Project (para. 2.05);
(d)  to include the following debt service covenant in the proposed
loan in place of the existing covenant under Loan 1688-JO. JEA
will obtain the Bank's prior approval for any new long-term
borrowing unless the net revenue for each year during the term of
the debt (before depreciation and interest) is at least equal to
1.5 times the projected debt service requirement for such year, on
all its debt, including the debt to be incurred (para. 3.13);
(e)  to the audit covenant in Section 4.02 of the Project Agreement
under Loan 1688-JO being repeated in the proposed Loan Agreement
(para. 3.14); and
(f)  to the covenant relating to insurance in Section 3.05 of the
Project Agreement under Loan 1688-JO being repeated in the
proposed agreement (para. 3.15).
5.05     JEPCO has agreed:
(a)  (i) to employ by December 31, 1981 consultants with qualifications
and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank to recommend by
December 31, 1982 improvements in JEPCO's organization, billing
system and management practices; and (ii) after taking into
account the Bank's comments, to implement promptly the consultants
recommendations (para 1.21);



- 38 -
(b)  to submit to the Bank by March 31, 1982 for its review and
comments a plan to develop its technical and financial planning
capabilities and to implement this plan in consultation with the
Bank (para. 1.32);
(c)  to submit to the Bank, not later than December 31, 1981, a
detailed staff training program and to implement the agreed
program in accordance with an implementation schedule satisfactory
to the Banlk (para. 2.04);
(d)  to employ consultants, whose qualification, experience and terms
and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank,
for engineering services, procurement and supervision of its part
of the Project (para. 2.06);
(e)  to obtain the Bank's prior approval for any new long-term
borrowing unless the net revenue less proposed dividends for each
year during the term of the debt (before depreciation and
interest) is at least equal to 1.5 times the projected debt
service requirement for such year, on all its debt, including the
debt to be incurred (para. 3.25);
(f)  to appoint independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and to
submit to the Bank audited financial statements for a year not
later than four months after the end of the year (para. 3.26); and
(g)  to take out and maintain with responsible insurers, or make other
provisions satisfactory to the Bank for insurance against such
risks and in such amounts as shall be consistent with appropriate
public utility practices (para. 3.27);
5.06     Retroactive financing up to US$400,000 equivalent would be
provided for foreign expenditures required for consultants services
incurred after January 1, 1981 but before loan signing (para. 2.16).
5.07     With the assurances listed above, the Project would provide a
suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$25 million to the Government. The
Government would onlend US$5 million to JEA and US$20 million to JEPCO on
the same terms as the Bank loan, under separate subsidiary loan
agreements. The loan would be repaid over a period of 17 years with 4
years of grace (para. 2.12).
5.08     The signing of subsidiary loan agreements by the Government and
JEA and JEPCO, respectively, would be a condition of loan effectiveness
(para. 2.12). The loan is expected to become effective within three months
of signing.

JORDAN
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Description of the Project
Transmission Lines and Substations
1.       The transmission lines included in the Project are:  Ma'an-Aqaba,
Amman South-East Ghor, and the lines connecting Ashrafiya and Sahab with
the existing transmission network. A double-circuit 132-kV transmission
line, about 99 km long, between Ma'an and Aqaba (via Quweira) will connect
the most southern region of Jordan with the national transmission network.
A line between Amman South and East Chor, 46 km long, will supply the water
pumping needs at East Ghor. Two short transmission lines, 7 and 4 km long,
will connect Ashrafiya and the Sahab Industrial Estate with the 132-kV line
between the Hussein thermal power station and Amman South, respectively.
The double-circuit lines will have 400 mm2 conductors and the same tech-
nical characteristics as the existing 132-kV lines. Detailed investiga-
tions have proven that the proposed transmission lines would provide ade-
quate power supply capacities to the new loads and would satisfy future
power system requirements. Line routes for the transmission lines to be
built have been secured.
2.       The Project comprises five new 132/33-kV transformer substations
(East Ghor, Ashrafiya, Sahab, Quweira and Aqaba) and the extension of the
five existing transformer substations (Irbid, Bayader, Hussein Power
Station, Amman South and Ma'an). At East Ghor substation the water pumping
load would be fed through 2x63 MVA transformers. The Quweira substation
(26 MVA) would supply local rural and water pumping loads. The Aqaba sub-
station (2x40 MVA) would supply industrial, commercial and domestic loads
and the city of Ac[aba. The extension of the existing substations would be
effected by installing additional transformers (135 MVA in total) and
related switchgear. Suitable sites of adequate size have been reserved for
all new substations and no problems are expected in their acquisition.
Rural Electrification
3.       JEA's rural electrification component of the Project includes a
power distribution network to electrify 30 villages with a total population
of about 20,000 living in the Central and Southern regions of Jordan (7
villages in the Karak area, 4 near Shoubak, 9 around Tafilah and 10 between
Ma'an and Wadi Musa). JEPCO's component would include 20 villages around
Amman with a population varying from 200 to 4,800 inhabitants.  The
proposed rural electrification schemes would include 33-kV lines,
substations and low voltage distribution facilities. Prestressed concrete
poles produced by JEA pole-spinning plant would be used for overhead
distribution lines. The rural electrification equipment would be

normalized and compatible with the existing equipment. JEA's component of
the rural electrification comprises 40 transformers (33/0.4-kv) with an
inistalled capacity of 5.6 MVA, about 140 km of 33-kV lines and about 120 km
of 0.4-kV overhead distribution lines. JEPCO's component comprises 27
transformer substations with an installed capacity of 3.75 MVA, 45 km of
33 (1l)-kV lines and about 170 km of 0.4-kV distribution lines.
Low Cost Housing Development
4.       Low cost housing developments to be served by JEPCO include hous-
ing estates at Zarqa, Marqa and Quweisma, which would provide low cost
accommodation for about 28,000 people. This project component includes 13
km of 11-kV underground cables, 5 km of 11-kV overhead lines, 24 km of low
voltage overhead lines and nine 0.5 MVA (11/0.4-kV) transformer substations.
Urban Distribution Extension
5.       JEPCO's urban distribution component represents a part of JEPCO's
distribution network in the city of Amman. This would include 13 km of
33-kV overhead lines to connect the Quastal water pumping substation, Sahab
Industrial Estate and 42.9 km of 33-kV cables to connect seven new substa-
tions in Amman. This component would also include about 140 MVA of
33/11-kV power transformers, 11-kV and low voltage cables and auxiliaries
for the city's distribution substations, and 120 (11-6.6/0.4-kV) distribu-
tion transformers (0.5 MVA each), and equipment and materials for upgrading
the existing 6-kV distribution system to 11-kV. The development of the
33-kV distribution system is based on the concept of standard size 33/11-kV
substations with an ultimate installed capacity of 20 MVA in the form of
two 10 MVA transformers. To match this, the 33-kV cable adopted is 300
mm2 which has a peak cyclic rating of approximately 20 MVA. It is con-
sidered that JEPCO's urban distribution extensions are properly planned to
meet load demands in the most economic manner. The construction work will
be carried out by JEPCO's construction department, which is well organized
and equipped for constructing urban distribution facilities.

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A. JORDAN ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
I. General
1.       All financial forecasts are given for the fiscal years of JEA
beginning January 1 and ending December 31. In addition to its power
utility operations, JEA is engaged in pole manufacturing, in relending of
the foreign loans to the distribution companies, JEPCO and IDECO, and in a
staff housing program. JEA's pole operations are designed to break even.
The earnings from the relending operations are not to be used for JEA's
operating expenses and will have to be transferred to its general reserve.
All non-electric operations, such as the relending and pole manufacturing
operations, are summarized and indicated as long-term investments in the
financial statements (Annex 3.1).
2.       The Rural Electrification Fund, administered by JEA, was
established on February 6, 1980 for providing capital for commercially
unattractive rural electrification projects. JEA's accumulated rural
electrification reserve as of the date of establishment of the fund and the
"Rural Fils" collected by a levy of 1 fil/kWh on all final consumers
constitute the source of this fund.
II. Income Statements
3.       Sales of Electricity are based on information furnished by JEA as
modified in the Bank. The forecasts assume annual kWh sales growth of 31%
in 1981, 32.8% in 1982, 37.2% in 1983, 23.4% in 1984, and 11.5% in 1985,
and annual maximum demand (MW) growth of 25.2% in 1981, 25.9% in 1982, 24%
in 1983, 14.1% in 1984 and 10.7% in 1985.
4.       Average Revenue per kWh for 1980 is based on:  (a) the average
revenue per kWh applicable to 1979; and (b) a tariff increase from March 1,
1980 resulting in an increase in revenues of about 70%. The following
tariff increases to comply with the proposed cash generation covenant
(para. 3.04) are assumed: 11% in January 1982, 15% in January 1983, 6% in
January 1984 and 14% in January 1985.

5.       Maintenance Charges are assumed to increase by the same percent-
ages as annual kWh sales of electricity.
6.       Other Operating Revenues are assumed to increase by the same
percentages as annual kWh sales of electricity.
7.       Fuel and Lubricants are based on estimates of generation from
steam units and combustion turbines using fuel prices, specific fuel
consumption and thermal efficiencies as follows:

B. JORDANIAN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY
I. General
27.      All financial forecasts are given for the fiscal years of JEPCO
beginning January 1 and ending December 31. JEPCO which was formed in 1962
by the merging of two electrical utilities operating in Amman and Zarqa has
a 50-year concession from the Government to operate as an electrical power
utility in the capital and suburbs. It is an investor-owned utility with
its shares freely traded on the Jordan Stock Exchange. The forecasts
included in Annex 3.2 have been prepared on a historical cost basis.
II. Income Statement
28.      Sales of Electricity are based on information furnished by JEPCO
as modified in the Bank. The forecasts assume annual kWh sales growth of
27.6% in 1981, 21.6% in 1982, 18.5% in 1983, 16.7% in 1984, and 14.4% in
1985, and annual maximum demand (MW) growth of 13.4% in 1981, 17.6% in
1982, 14.4% in 1983, 17.1% in 1984 and 14.9% in 1985. The forecast is
based on tariff increases of 10.9% in 1982, 13.7% in 1983 and 6.5% in 1985
to comply with the proposed cash generation covenant (para. 3.24) and the
energy sales forecast included in Annex 3.2.
29.      Maintenance Charges are assumed to increase by the same
percentages as annual kWh sales of electricity.

31.      Operating Expenses on distribution and administration were calcu-
lated by predicting the number of employees in relation to the number of
consumers and the average cost per employee. Depreciation has been
calculated using the depreciation rates allowed under the law. During the
projection period 1981-85,the average depreciation rate would vary between
3.4 and 3.6.
32.      Taxes.  Corporation tax has been calculated at the present rate of
38.5%, and University tax at 1%.
III. Balance Sheet
33.      In preparing the forecast balance sheets, stores have been fore-
cast in relation to fixed assets on a declining percentage basis on the
assumption that as the system grows and further standardization takes place
economies in the amount of stores kept can be made. Accounts receivable
has been estimated as a fixed percentage of revenues from the sale of
electricity. The customer contributions cover the actual cost to provide
the customer's portion of the supply. Additions to reserves are based on
the statutory requirements and the provisions of the JEPCO's Articles of
Association. Accounts payable includes about five week's purchased energy
costs and one month operating expenses excluding depreciation and taxes.
For purposes of proforma revaluation of JEPCO's assets, the following index
for international inflation has been assumed: 1981-9%, 1982-8%, 1983-7%,
1984-6.7% and 1985-6.5%.
IV. Sources and Applications of Funds
34.      Borrowings.  All foreign borrowings are converted to Jordan Dinars
at the rate of US$1 = JD 0.3. JEPCO's planned borrowing program has been
adjusted to meet the needs of the construction program as revised by the
Bank and taking into account, JEPCO's internal cash generation and proposed
grant from the Rural Electrification Fund.
35.      Construction Requirements are based on JEPCO's estimates as
revised by the Bank and escalated using the following percentages for price
contingencies corresponding to expected conditions in Jordan:
1981    1982    1983-1985
Equipment and Civil Works               9.0     8.5        7.5
36.      Amortization of Long-Term Debt.  Amortization of existing and
future foreign loans is based on information provided by JEPCO.
