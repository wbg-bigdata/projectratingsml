THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
Beneficiaries:           Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA), and Jordanian
Electric Power Company (JEPCO).
Amount:                  US$25.0 million equivalent.
Terms:                   17 years, including 4 years of grace at an interest
rate of 9.6 percent per annum.
Relending Terms:         The Government would onlend US$5.0 million to JEA
and US$20.0 million to JEPCO on the same terms as
those of the Bank loan; JEA and JEPCO would each
bear the foreign exchange risk on its respective
portion of the loan.
Project
Description:            The Fourth Power Project is an integral part of
JEA's and JEPCO's 1981-84 network development pro-
grams. The primary objective of the project is to
provide adequate transmission and distribution net-
work facilities to meet the rapidly growing power
needs and to improve the quality of power supply
services in Jordan in the most economical way. In
addition, the project provides for continued Bank
assistance for institution building within JEA,
initial assistance to JEPCO and further assistance
in developing planning and coordination in the
energy sector. The project would comprise:
(a) construction of about 160 km of 132-kV
transmission lines;
(b)  construction of five new transformer and
extension of five existing tranformer
substations, with a total capacity of about
619 MVA;
(c)  extension of the urban distribution network,
including power supply to three low-cost hous-
ing developments;
(d) electrification of about 20 villages around
Amman and 30 villages in the Central and
Southern Regions of Jordan;

(e) consultants services for project engineering
and construction;
(f) review of JEPC0's organization and management;
(g) training program for JEA's and JEPCO's staff;
and
(h) consultant services to assist in energy sector
development.
The project would serve five municipal and indus-
trial load centers from the national grid, rein-
forcing substation capacity at five important load
centers and help electrify about 50 villages with a
total of 23,000 inhabitants and three low-cost
housing areas being developed for 28,000
inhabitants. No particular project risks are
envisaged.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN FOR A
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Bank loan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan of US$25 million equivalent to
help finance a Fourth Power project. The loan would have a term of 17
years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at 9.6percent per annum.
The Government will relend US$5.0 million of the loan to the Jordan
Electricity Authority (JEA) and US$20.0 million to the Jordanian Electric
Power Company (JEPCO), on the same terms as those of the Bank loan. JEA
and JEPCO would each bear the foreign exchange risk on its respective
portion of the loan. The project would be cofinanced with the Kuwait Fund
which has indicated it would provide a loan of KD 5 million (or US$18
million equivalent). The proposed fourth Bank loan and the Kuwait Fund
loan represent the continuing external support that Government receives for
the rapidly developing power subsector in Jordan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       A report entitled "Country Economic Memorandum on Jordan" (No.
3135-JO, dated December 24, 1980) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in January 1981. Country data sheets are attached as Annex 1.
3.       Jordan is a country of 2.2 million people (East Bank) with limited
natural resources and a traditionally service and trade-oriented economy.
It has enjoyed a high rate of growth and made good progress in diversifying
commodity production, increasing investment, and promoting exports. This
economic performance has taken place in the context of increasing exchange
with neighboring countries in the form of trade and labor migration and of
expanding financial inflow in the form of remittances of Jordanians working
abroad, foreign aid and capital. As a result, almost full employment has
been reached, and steadily rising foreign reserves have strengthened the
Jordanian Dinar.
Recent Economic Developments
4.       Renewed stability following the disruptions of 1967-71 created a
climate conducive to sustained economic growth during 1975-79, resulting in
an average annual growth of CDP of about 10 percent in real terms. This
growth was in sharp contrast with that during 1970-74, which was slightly
negative. In 1979 GDP per capita reached about $1,020 in current prices
while GNP per capita reached $1,200. The upsurge of the economy was due to
(a) the rapid growth of the mining and manufacturing sectors; (b) the sharp
increase in construction, particularly in housing and large public works;



- 2 -
and (c) favorable external factors including influx of Lebanese business
activity and booming conditions in the Gulf countries. In agriculture,
rainfed production was sharply reduced by a severe four-year drought, but
vegetable and fruit production in the irrigated area increased signif-
icantly. The private sector showed growing strength especially in promot-
ing export-oriented ventures.
5.       The overall balance of payments remains strong despite a chronic
deficit in merchandise trade. Exports of goods and non-factor services
increased by 29 percent annually from 1975 to 1979 (22 percent in constant
prices). Significant growth was achieved due to high demand and prices for
fruits and vegetables in neighboring countries, booming exports of
manufactured goods and sharp increase in receipts from tourism and other
non-factor services. Jordanian goods have been able to compete
successfully in Middle East markets because of the advantages of Arab
Common Market and bilateral agreements, relatively good quality of the
products, enterprising marketing and the favorable geographical location.
Although the growth in the volume of imports was slower than exports, the
resource gap increased in current terms from $560 million in 1975 to about
*1,600 million in 1979. Since 1977, most of these deficits were covered by
workers' remittances and foreign capital inflows including grants. As a
result, the Government-guaranteed external borrowing remained within
reasonable limits and borrowing on commercial terms was reduced to a modest
level (para. 15).
6.       Capital expenditures financed by the Government almost tripled
between 1975 and 1979 and were the main cause of the increase in the
overall budget deficit from 5 percent of GNP in 1975 to 11 percent in
1979. Domestic revenues expanded in parallel with economic growth and
accounted for about 26 percent of GNP in 1979, a rather high ratio by
international standards. Current expenditures, excluding defense, were
covered by domestic revenues. Defense expenditures were largely financed
by foreign assistance. During 1977-79, about 12 percent of capital
expenditures were financed from the current budget surplus, 21 percent by
foreign grants, 42 percent by foreign loans, and the rest by other domestic
resources. Advances from the Central Bank generally declined throughout
the period to reach a level of 10 percent of Government outlays in 1979.
7.       The main concerns of monetary policy have been mobilizing savings
and controlling domestic liquidity. While the savings performance has
improved, gross domestic savings have continued to be negative because of
the high level of defense expenditures. Although the share of foreign
grants used for military imports is not clearly delineated, assuming that
in 1979 at least 60 percent of net foreign transfers were used for military
imports and were, therefore, excluded from domestic consumption, gross
domestic savings would be positive. To promote domestic savings, greater
discretion is being allowed to the Central Bank in adjusting interest rates
and banking commissions. Increases in deposit rates were effected and have
resulted in savings deposits increasing faster than money supply. Between
1977 and 1979, inflation, measured by the cost of living index, increased
by 11.5 percent annually.



- 3 -
8.       A diversified banking system capable of meeting the financial
requirements of fast economic growth was developed during the last decade.
The banking system now includes 15 commercial banks and 8 specialized
credit and investment institutions. The Amman Stock Exchange, established
in 1978, has become an active institution, and the Securities Corporation,
created with IFC assistance, is growing in strength. The liberal transfer
policy recently followed by the Central Bank has encouraged growth of the
financial system, and Amman has started emerging as an international
financial center.
Medium-Term Prospects
9.       The final document of the new National Plan (1981-85) has not yet
been published and no official medium term projections are available. The
Government's announced strategy is to pursue the objectives of the last
decade of economic planning in Jordan, namely to: (a) reduce dependence on
external assistance; (b) diversify the economy by increasing commodity
production; (c) reduce the budget deficit; and (d) improve the distribution
of the benefits of growth.
10.      The Bank's medium-term economic projections indicate that the
rapid GNP growth achieved in recent years would have to slow down to about
6 percent per annum after 1981 if the trade deficit and dependence on
foreign aid are to be significantly reduced. If the trend of expanding
exports is maintained and that of imports reduced drastically, the annual
external trade deficit could be met by workers' remittances coupled with
prudent external borrowing (para. 16).
11.      The medium-term prospects for increasing exports and diversifying
commodity production are promising. The completion of the major projects
now under implementation (phosphate mining, cement, potash, and fertil-
izer), together with the enterprise displayed by the private sector should
result in significant increases in foreign exchange earnings after 1982.
In agriculture, the expected increase in vegetable and fruit exports will
be more than offset by growing imports of food, and the agricultural trade
deficit will probably increase. In energy, the increasing burden of oil
imports has caused concern and made energy planning a priority.
12.      Savings from private sources, particularly from workers abroad,
should continue to increase, helped by the expanding banking network. A
reduction of the budget deficit could also be expected. A working group is
at present preparing recommendations on the fiscal system, but a radical
structural reform might be socially difficult to implement. Although
current expenditure, excluding defense, is expected to grow at a slower
pace than the economy, the demands for increased social expenditure and the
need for higher wages to retain valuable public servants will not permit
significant cuts in expenditure except for investment financing and
subsidies for energy and food products.



-4-
Social Issues
13.      Due to the continuing migration of Jordanians to neighboring
countries and the rapid economic growth, the economy has reached almost
full employment and pressures have emerged on the demand side. Out of the
750,000 Jordanians estimated to be living abroad, 300,000 are estimated to
be working, compared to a total domestic employment of about 447,000.
About 70,000 foreigners, mostly unskilled, are working in Jordan. The
country has expanded its education and training system rapidly but still
needs a comprehensive manpower and training plan to help ensure that: (a)
the economy does not suffer from shortages of crucial skills, while meeting
prospective demand for skilled workers abroad as far as possible; and (b)
the potential labor force is utilized more fully--especially the seasonally
idle workers in rainfed areas and women, whose participation, although
growing fast, is still low.
14.      Social issues are now an acknowledged concern of the Government
and this new emphasis would be reflected in the new National Plan (1981-
85). Although the social indicators provide a relatively favorable reading
in most sectors, the social services are unevenly distributed across income
groups and across provinces. Thus, although health infrastructure is
adequate and life expectancy is relatively high (56 years), medical doctors
are concentrated in urban centers. In education, while the overall adult
literacy rate is high (70 percent in 1978 compared to 40 percent in the
Middle East Region), rural areas are short of teachers and school facili-
ties are inadequate. Housing remains a problem despite the boom in
1978-80, mainly because housing costs have far exceeded the means of the
lower income groups. The Government's concern about these issues has led
to the setting up of the new Ministry of Social Affairs in November 1979 to
define a coherent social development program.
External Assistance
15.      Due to large foreign inflows of remittances and transfers, the
current account of the balance of payments has shown only moderate deficits
since 1977, and the government-guaranteed external debt has remained within
reasonable limits. Workers' remittances increased from $150 million in
1975 to $500 million in 1979. Foreign aid exceeded $500 million in 1977
and fell to $410 million in 1978. Following the Baghdad Arab Summit Con-
ference in November 1978, which pledged assistance of about $1.2 billion
per year until 1983, net foreign aid rose again to a record high of about
$1.0 billion in 1979. The external public debt outstanding reached $1.0
billion at the end of 1979; the outstanding debt to IDA was $67 million and
to IBRD, $4 million ($85 million and $69 million including undisbursed,
respectively). In 1977 and 1978, Jordan borrowed $224 and $100 million
respectively on the Eurodollar market, but in 1979, higher foreign aid
allowed the borrowing to be further reduced to $39 million. External debt



service payments amounted to $96 million in 1979 or 5.3 percent of total
exports of goods and services.
16.      Jordan's relative stability and pragmatic economic and social
policies have helped to attract large foreign assistance. The continuation
of foreign economic assistance at the relatively high levels of recent
years obviously depends on international and regional developments. Except
for aid related to defense expenditures, the grant component of this
foreign assistance is, however, expected to decline over the next few
years. Assuming that the investment rate slows down to a level of 24 per-
cent of GNP by 1985, the projections indicate a need for external commit-
ments of about $600 million each year over the 1981-85 period (compared to
an annual average of $410 million for 1977-79). One-third of this borrow-
ing is expected to be on concessional terms, somewhat below the ratio in
recent years. While bilateral and multilateral sources can be expected to
provide the bulk of external resources, Jordan is likely to resort increas-
ingly to the financial markets, and this would result in a hardening of
loan terms. On these assumptions, the debt service ratio as a percentage
of exports of goods and services would reach 8 percent at the end 1981 and
is projected not to exceed 10 percent by 1985.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
17.      Jordan has received five Bank loans totalling $100 million and
fifteen IDA credits totalling $85.3 million (net of cancellations) of which
twelve have been fully disbursed. Project implementation is generally
satisfactory. As of December 31, 1980, disbursements amounted to 79 per-
cent of appraisal estimates and 98 percent of revised estimates. The IDA
credits have mainly financed physical and social infrastructure projects,
such as education, highways, water supply and sewerage, power, irrigation
and tourism. With Jordan having attained a stage in its economic develop-
ment where it could be considered creditworthy for Bank lending, and having
reached a GNP per capita level that exceeded IDA limits, the Third Amman
Water Supply and Sewerage Project, approved in March 1978, was the last
project financed through an IDA credit. IFC has made four investments in
Jordan with total commitments of $32.1 million, consisting of a $244,000
equity participation and a $1.6 million loan to Jordan Ceramic Industries
Limited (JCI) in 1974, a $3.1 million equity participation in the promotion
of a phosphatic fertilizer project in 1975 including a subsequent $20
million loan and $3.6 million additional equity participation in June 1978
(see para 19), a $667,000 equity participation and a $2.5 million loan to a
brick company in December 1978 and $674,000 equity participation in the
Jordan Security Corporation in June 1979. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of April 1, 1981, and IFC
investments as of February 28, 1981, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.



- 6 -
18.      Unlike past Bank Group assistance to Jordan which was largely for
infrastructure projects, recent and proposed lending is also directed
toward large export-oriented projects with foreign exchange earning poten-
tial for which the Bank Group has closely cooperated with the Government in
project preparation and in mobilizing large external financial assistance.
In addition, the Bank Group has been assisting the Government in implement-
ing its social objectives of improving the income and living standards of
the rural and urban poor, as enunciated in the Five-Year Plan (1976-80) and
which is likely to receive even greater emphasis in the new Five-Year Plan.
19.      In line with these overall objectives, the Bank Group has provided
technical assistance for developing and implementing a plan for expanding
phosphate rock production, and preparing a comprehensive program for a
second phase of development of the agricultural potential of the Jordan
Valley and for water supply based on the Maqarin Dam. An engineering
credit was made in FY1975 to help prepare the project for potash production
from the Dead Sea via solar evaporation, for which a loan was approved by
the Executive Directors in September 1978. In addition, IFC has assisted
the Government in preparing a phosphatic fertilizer project to produce
diammonium phosphate (DAP) and triple superphosphate (TSP) for which an IFC
loan of $20 million and equity participation of $3.6 million were approved
by the Executive Directors in June 1978, in addition to IFC's equity
participation of $3.1 million in 1975 (see para 17). Support for the
Government's social objectives was provided by loan for the Third Education
project that was approved in December 1979, the Cities and Village
Development Bank (CVDB) project approved in March 1980 and the Urban
Development project approved in July 1980.
20.      Projects are under preparation in the education, water supply,
industrial and power sectors. In the agriculture sector, we propose to
assist in the development of irrigated production in the Jordan Valley and
are preparing a rainfed agriculture project to help small farmers increase
their yields through improved inputs of seeds and fertilizer as well as
through better cultivation practices.
21.      At the end of 1979, the Bank Group's share in Jordan's external
public debt was estimated at 6.7 percent, and its share in debt service was
1.0 percent. By 1985 the Bank Group's shares in debt outstanding and in
debt service are expected to be about 6.0 percent and 6.4 percent respec-
tively.
PART III - THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources
22.      Jordan has no coal deposits or any known reserves of oil or
natural gas and is totally dependent on oil imports for its energy needs.
The oil is imported via off-take from the Trans-Arabian Pipeline and



- 7 -
refined at Zarqa. The only potential indigenous energy resources are oil
shale, tar sands, a small hydropower potential, geothermal and solar
energy. Studies are currently underway for the utilization of the esti-
mated 10,000 million tons of shale rocks for either power generation or
direct oil extraction. No program has been formulated yet for developing
the tar sands and the hydropower potential is confined to 2 MW at the King
Talal Dam and 20 MW at the proposed Maqarin Dam. Prospects for developing
the geothermal resources are not bright due to low water temperatures.
While efforts to develop solar energy have attained initial success with
limited manufacture of solar components, its present and future usage is
expected to be limited to water heating. Efforts are also underway to
revitalize oil and gas exploration activities which had nearly been
abandoned for lack of success. A possible future option to boost Jordan's
energy resource base is a hydrolink between the Red Sea and Dead Sea, for
which a preliminary study exists, to utilize the 400 meter head for power
generation.
Policy Issues
23.      (a) Overall Planning and Coordination.  Jordan lacks a comprehen-
sive plan for the management and development of energy resources. Energy-
related institutions presently operate within their respective specialties
with insufficient coordination. The sector institutions include: the
Royal Scientific Society which is responsible for research on solar energy
and other renewable energy resources; the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company
which handles the importation of crude oil, its refining, distribution and
marketing; and the Natural Resources Authority which is responsible for
exploring for all non-renewable energy resources. The power subsector is
regulated by the Jordan Electricity Authority which is chaired by the
Minister of Industry and Trade. In 1977, the Government set up the
National Energy Council (NEC) consisting of the representatives of all the
organizations in the energy sector, to set overall policies, commission
studies, and monitor their implementation. However, NEC lacks the staff
and financial resources to carry out its mandate effectively. The Govern-
ment has taken steps in the right direction with the establishment in late
1979 of the Energy Department in the Ministry of Industry and Trade to
assist in coordination of energy related institutions and monitor the
implementation of the resolutions of the NEC. This Department now has a
small professional staff and is beginning to function but it needs to be
strengthened if it is to become capable of planning for the sector and
coordinating the work of institutions in the sector particularly with
respect to the development of indigenous resources.. The Government has
agreed to formulate a plan, by June 30, 1982, for strengthening the plan-
ning and management of the energy sector and improving the coordination
among energy related institutions (Section 3.02 of the Loan Agreement).



- 8 -
(b) Energy Pricing. The total cost of imported crude oil rose
from $6 million in 1970 (about 1 percent of GNP) to about $360 million in
1980 (12 percent of GNP). Except for gasoline and LPG, prices of petroleum
products, especially kerosene and diesel oil, are lower than international
prices. The resulting subsidies are a considerable drain on budgetary
resources despite significant increases in prices of petroleum products in
February 1980 and February 1981. Future increases in prices of petroleum
products to eliminate gradually existing subsidies would be one of the
issues to be reviewed by the consultants financed under the proposed proj-
ect to assist the Government in improving the management of the energy
sector.
(c) Energy Efficiency and Conservation. As economic activity
picked up in the 1970s, the growth in energy consumption (15 percent per
annum) has exceeded the growth in GDP (12 percent per annum). In light of
the scarcity of energy resources and the long period required for their
development, it is imperative that the Government rapidly institute a
program for managing the growing energy demand. In addition, efforts
should be made to diversify Jordan's use of energy resources (e.g., use of
imported coal).
24.      The Government is utilizing Bank assistance in studying these
issues. A Bank mission visited Jordan in December 1979 to assist the
Government in preparing terms of reference for exploiting Jordan's oil
shale resources and another mission visited Jordan in February 1980 to
undertake a brief review of the energy sector. The Bank would continue its
assistance under the proposed project by supporting studies by consultants
that would assist the Government in setting policies for energy pricing,
demand management, energy conservation as well as a strategy for developing
indigenous resources.
Power Subsector
25.      The power subsector is controlled by the Ministry of Industry and
Trade. The General Electricity Law of 1976 defines the principles and
basic regulations for the power subsector in Jordan, including procedures
for tariff approvals and licensing of new power facilities. Responsibility
for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution is divided
mainly among the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA), the Jordanian Electric
Power Company (JEPCO) and the Irbid District Electricity Company (IDECO).
There are captive plants serving the larger industrial enterprises and
small isolated systems serving municipalities and villages.
Subsector Institutions
26.      JEA was established in 1967 to coordinate the development of the
country's power subsector and is entrusted with responsibility under the



- 9 -
General Electricity Law for power generation, transmission and dis-
tribution and for regulating power consumption in the country. JEA is also
authorized to manufacture electrical and other equipment needed by the
power system. Under this law, JEA acquired, with Government approval,
small inefficient power entities as the national power system developed and
has moved progressively to serve previously isolated loads from the
national grid. In addition, JEA sets the electricity supply rates charged
by other utilities such as JEPCO and IDECO and is in charge of preparing
and implementing the national rural electrification plan.
27.      JEPCO is largely an investor-owned company distributing power in
the Amman area and its activities are governed by a Concession Agreement of
1962 with the Government to supply power to the Amman area for 50 years.
In 1980 the ownership of JEPCO was distributed among individuals (68 per-
cent), municipalities (7 percent), industrial enterprises (4 percent), JEA
(14 percent), and various institutions (7 percent). Prior to the creation
of JEA, JEPCO was the largest power generating and distributing enterprise
in Jordan. However, JEPCO has since ceased its power generation and
purchases all its power from JEA at the 33-kV level. Since JEPCO is
responsible for power distribution in the relatively highly developed and
densely populated area of the City of Amman and its vicinity, it is the
largest power distributor in Jordan (accounting for 80 percent of total
sales) and its sound future development is important for the development of
the power subsector in Jordan. The proposed Bank loan would be the first
direct Bank assistance to JEPCO.
28.      IDECO, the third utility, operates a 9-MW diesel plant in Irbid
and distributes power in the City of Irbid, some surrounding villages and
part of the Jordan Valley and accounts for less than 10 percent of total
power consumption in Jordan. JEA owns about 47 percent and the Municipal-
ity of Irbid about 43 percent of IDECO, with private investors holding the
rest of the shares. Seconded staff from JEA have assisted IDECO to over-
come the serious managerial and financial problems that had plagued it in
the past. With the Government's assistance, all necessary financing has
been secured for IDECO's 1981-85 development program.
Power Generation and Demand
29.      Total electricity generation in Jordan, including imported power
from Syria, increased from 230 GWh in 1971 to 885 GWh in 1979, while con-
sumption increased at 18 percent per annum from 204 GWh to 723 GWh during
this period. The 1979 peak demand of the interconnected system was 153 MW
with an installed capacity of 302 MW. The consumption of electricity in
1979 was as follows: industrial, 39 percent; domestic, 27 percent; com-
mercial, 13 percent; water pumping, 7 percent. The remaining 14 percent
was consumed primarily for hospitals, street-lighting, broadcasting and
television. The 1979 per capita consumption of electricity was 408 kWh
(the level attained by Egypt in 1977 and Portugal in 1952) compared to 162
kWh in 1974. About 36 percent of the total population, mostly in the rural
areas, still have no access to public electric supply (see para. 33).



- 10 -
30.      The power system in Jordan comprises three 33 MW steam units, four
gas turbines and about 20 small diesel sets. The Jordan Phosphates Mines
Company operates the largest captive plant with 22 MW; about 20 MW is pro-
vided by small municipal systems. The national transmission network com-
prises 135 km of transmission lines and six transformer substations with
installed capacity of 285 MVA. The Jordanian and Syrian power systems were
initially connected in 1977 via a 66-kV transmission line. A new 230-kV
transmission line would allow better utilization of the power generating
facilities of both countries. It would be used to import up to 20 GWh
annually from Syria when the interconnection becomes operational and would
obviate the need for Jordan to invest in 50 MW of additional generating
capacity.
31.      The national load forecast shows total systems sales growing at 21
percent per annum from 796 GWh in 1980 to 2,468 GWh in 1985, with maximum
demand increasing from 187 MW to 462 MW during this period. The system's
load factor is expected to improve from 49 percent in 1980 to 67 percent in
1985, representing better utilization of generating facilities. The pro-
portion of JEA's sales to large industries would increase from 9 percent in
1980 to 31 percent in 1985 as several large industrial schemes are com-
pleted and become operational. Per capita consumption would rise from
about 480 kWh in 1980 to 990 kWh in 1985. About 213 MW of new generating
capacity would be added in this period. In addition, commitments would be
made for 2 x 120 MW steam units for Aqaba to be commissioned in 1986.
About 315 km of 132-kV transmission lines with 629 MVA in substation capa-
city is under construction and the construction of 518 km of transmission
lines including 583 MVA substation capacity is planned for 1983-86.
32.      JEA's portion of the national investment program for 1981-85 is
about $553 million (in late 1980 prices) while JEPCO's and IDECO's invest-
ment requirements for 1981-1985 are estimated at $121 million and $33 mil-
lion, respectively. About 26 percent of JEA's investment requirements
would be met from internal resources and the rest from borrowings, much of
which are already identified. JEPCO is expected to finance about 25 per-
cent of its investment requirement from internal sources. The Government
has secured loans for JEPCO from the European Investment Bank, the US and
the UbSR. Other foreign and local borrowings, including the proposed Bank
loan, are planned to complete the financing plan for JEPCO's investment
program. About 70 percent of the investment requirements would be met from
borrowings of which 41 percent is still to be identified (para. 46). In
order to plan, implement and monitor properly the above programs, JEA and
JEPCO would need to strengthen their planning capabilities (see paras. 39
and 43).
Rural Electrification
33.      Only about 45 percent of the rural population at present has
access to electricity. To extend electricity to this segment of the popu-
lation, JEA is currently implementing a national rural electrification plan
which would by 1983 cover about 84 percent of the rural population. By



- 11 -
1993, when the plan is expected to be completed, only very small and remote
villages or temporary settlements would not have access to electricity.
Various bilateral aid agencies are assisting in implementing the rural
electrification program. USAID has provided funds for the electrification
of 37 villages and 2 low-cost housing areas in the Amman district and the
USSR would finance the electrification of 100 villages in Irbid district
and 32 villages in Amman district. About 20 remote villages would be
served by mobile units financed by Denmark, and the UK would finance the
electrification of 20 villages in the Irbid district. The proposed project
would finance the electrification of about 60 villages in addition to the
39 villages financed under the Third Power project.
Tariffs
34.      Under existing tariff covenants, JEA is required to maintain
tariff levels sufficient to earn a minimum of 9 percent on revalued assets,
with revaluation mandatory after December 31, 1981. Agreement was reached
during negotiations to change the financial targets to a cash generation
covenant (para. 41). JEPCO's tariffs are set so as to cover operating
expenses plus interest on debt and to provide at least 7.5 percent dividend
on the nominal value of equity shares. The tariffs are based on a study
prepared by consultants (North Eastern Electricity Board-U.K.), taking into
account the marginal costs of generating, transmitting and distributing
electricity, with periodic adjustments for fuel costs. The latest tariff
increase was effected in March 1980. Retail tariffs range between
37-52 Fils/kWh for domestic customers, 45-57 Fils/kWh for commercial
customers and 39-44 Fils/kWh for small industrial customers consuming less
than 2,500 kWh/month. (This is equivalent to a range of from $0.11 cents
to $0.19 cents per kWh.) In view of the 50 percent increase in fuel prices
in February 1981, which JEA was not allowed to pass on to consumers through
the fuel adjustment clause in 1981, JEA is planning a review of its tariffs
by the end of July 1981 (para. 41).
Role of IDA/Bank in the Power Subsector
35.      The proposed loan would be the fourth Bank Group lending operation
for power in Jordan and represents the first Bank assistance to JEPCO,
the largest power distribution company in Jordan. The first IDA Credit
(386-JO) for $10.2 million together with a $10.2 million loan from the
Kuwait Fund was used to finance the installation of the two 33-MW steam
units and a 13-MW gas turbine at the Hussein Thermal Power Plant (HTPP).
The second IDA Credit (570-JO) for $5 million cofinanced with the Arab Fund
($13.4 million) the third 33-MW unit at HTPP, the reconditioning of the
Marqa diesel unit and a power development study which provided the basis
for the third and the proposed fourth power projects. The first and second
projects have been completed and are operating satisfactorily. A project



- 12 -
completion report covering both projects is under preparation. The third
project, assisted by a $15 million Bank loan (Loan 1688-JO), aims at an
expansion of JEA's transmission network and substation capacity as well as
the electrification of 39 villages in Central Jordan. All contracts for
the project components have been awarded and implementation is proceeding
satisfactorily and on schedule. Overall, Bank Group operations in the sub-
sector have supported the development of a rapidly expanding and modern
power system. Some of the achievements, besides helping to attract other
external financing, are assisting in the development of JEA as an efficient
and financially viable entity responsible for the entire power subsector,
the introduction of a tariff structure based on marginal costs and the pro-
gressive interconnection of the Jordan power system into a reliable and
economic national grid. However, new challenges have emerged such as the
urgent need to strengthen energy sector planning capabilities and usual
operating problems have been magnified by the growth of the operations of
the power entities and the need to cope with the rapid expansion of the
subsector. The proposed project would address these problems.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
36.      Under the second power project, JEA engaged consultants (Preece
Cardew and Rider (PCR)-UK) to prepare a study for the long term development
of the power subsector. The proposed project is based on the findings of
the study and on a project feasibility report prepared by the same con-
sultants in 1980. The project was appraised in October/November, 1980.
Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. between March 23 and 26, 1981.
The Government was represented by Dr. Hanna Odeh, President of the National
Planning Council, JEA by Dr. Hisham Khatib, Director General of JEA, and
JEPCO by Mr. Marwan Bushnaq, Deputy General Manager of JEPCO. A Staff
Appraisal Report entitled "Jordan - Fourth Power Project," (No. 3329-JO)
dated April 10, 1981 has been distributed separately. Supplementary
project data are provided in Annex III.
Project Objectives and Description
37.      The main objective of the project is to support the expansion of
power transmission and distribution facilities to meet the rapidly growing
needs of Jordan's burgeoning economy at least cost. The project also aims
at improving the quality of power supply, assisting the country's rural
electrification program, continuing the institution building efforts to
strengthen JEA and to initiate a similar program of assistance for JEPCO.
The project would also provide assistance to the Jordanian authorities in
the development of the country's energy sector. The major components of
the project are:
Part A (Jordan Electricity Authority)
(i) construction of about 160 km of transmission lines (132-kV)
to connect the important economic centers of Aqaba, Quweira,



- 13 -
East Ghor, Ashrafiya and Sahab with the national transmission
network;
(ii)  extension and reinforcement of 5 existing transformer
substations and construction of 5 new transformer substations
with a total installed capacity of about 619 MVA;
(iii) electrification of 30 villages in the Central and Southern
regions as part of the national rural electrification plan;
(iv)  consultants' services for assistance in implementing the
project; and
(v)  training of staff.
Part B (Jordanian Electric Power Company)
(i)  extension of the urban distribution network including 13 km
of overhead lines, 43 km of cables, about 140 MVA of 33/11-kV
power transformers, equipment and materials for about 70
distribution substations and related auxiliaries, and
upgrading the existing 6-kV distribution system to 11-kV;
(ii)  electrification of three low cost housing developments;
(iii) electrification of 20 villages around Amman;
(iv)  consultants' services for assistance in implementing the
project;
(v)  organizational review with special focus on financial manage-
ment, accounting procedures and the establishment of a
training program; and
(v)  training of staff.
Part C (Ministry of Industry and Trade)
Consultants' services to assist the Government in devising
policies for energy pricing, demand management, energy conservation and a
strategy for developing indigenous energy resources.
Project Implementation
38.      Part A of the project will be implemented by JEA.  JEA's consul-
tants(PCR) prepared the project feasibility study, partly financed under
the second power project (Credit 570-JO). The consultants have investi-
gated the line routes and substation sites and have already started draft-
ing the bidding documents. JEA has the necessary experience in carrying
out transmission and distribution projects; nevertheless, JEA would con-
tinue to need consultants' assistance in procurement and supervision of



- 14 -
project implementation and hence during negotiations agreement was reached
for JEA to continue to employ consultants whose qualifications, experience
and terms of employment will be satisfactory to the Bank (bection 2.02 of
the JEA Project Agreement). Part B of the project would be implemented by
JEPCO with the assistance of its consultants (Kennedy & Donkin (KD) -
U.K.). KD maintains a permanent resident engineer at JEPCO headquarters
and would actively assist in all project-related activities. Detailed
designs for the urban distribution extensions, low-cost housing, power
supply and rural electrification have been prepared. However, JEPCO would
continue to need consultants to prepare the bidding documents and to assist
in project implementation. During negotiations, JEPCO agreed to continue
to employ consultants whose experience, qualifications and terms of employ-
ment are satisfactory to the Bank (Section 2.02 of the JEPCO Project Agree-
ment). Part C of the project would be implemented by the Ministry of
Industry and Trade, with the assistance of qualified energy consultants to
be employed by December 31, 1981, under terms of reference drawn up in
consultation with the Bank (Section 3.03(a) of the Loan Agreement). It
would aim at strengthening the capabilities for energy planning, improving
the policies for the management of the demand for energy and formulating a
long term program aimed at the exploitation of Jordan's domestic energy
resources. Demand management would involve the formulation of policies for
the rationalization of energy prices, and programs for energy saving con-
sisting of energy audits, interfuel substitution, cogeneration and waste-
heat recovery. The formulation of a program for the exploitation of
Jordan's domestic energy resources would involve assessing the optimal uses
for the existing resources and the exploration for new potential sources of
energy. The Government has agreed to provide the Bank with a timetable by
December 31, 1982 of actions to be taken to implement the consultants
recommendations (Section 3.03(b) of the Loan Agreement). The project is
expected to be completed by December 31, 1984.
Project Implementing Agencies
39.      Organization, Management and Staffing of JEA.  JEA oversees the
overall development of the power subsector in Jordan (para. 26). JEA has a
Board of eight Directors with the Minister of Industry and Trade as Chair-
man and the President of the National Planning Council as Vice Chairman.
The Director General of JEA, who is appointed by the Board, is responsible
for the day-to-day management of JEA. The Director General, a very capable
and internationally known engineer, is assisted by the Chief Engineer who
oversees all technical departments, including Administration and Finance.
JEA's organizational structure is based on proposals of management con-
sultants (Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co.) appointed under the first power
project (Credit 386-JO) and is considered sound. JEA is well managed. All
its managerial staff are professionally qualified and have prior experience
in power operations in Jordan or abroad. In November 1980, JEA had 1,373
employees including 114 engineers and 681 technical staff. Despite its
strong staffing, JEA still depends on external consultants for its power
system planning and analysis. However, JEA is endeavoring to develop its
internal capabilities in this area. During negotiations JEA agreed to



- 15 -
continue to strengthen its Planning Department and to inform the Bank no
later than December 31, 1981, of the specific actions to be taken in this
regard (section 3.02 of the JEA Project Agreement). JEA has prepared a
training program covering its needs up to 1983 and timely implementation is
important for JEA to meet the expanding needs of the power subsector. Dur-
ing negotiations JEA agreed to begin implementation of a staff training
program by September 1, 1981, with details and implementation schedule
satisfactory to the Bank (Section 3.03 of the JEA Project Agreement).
40.      Financial Performance and Prospects of JEA.  JEA's net fixed
assets have grown very rapidly from less than a million JD in 1975 to about
JD 42 million in 1980. The efficiency of its operations has also improved
as reflected in the ratio of kWh generated per employee, which increased
from 420,000 in 1977 to 600,000 in 1980. The existing revenue covenant
under Credits 368-JO and 570-JO, and Loan 1688-JO requires JEA to maintain
tariffs at levels sufficient to yield a minimum annual rate of return of
9 percent on revalued assets, with revaluation not becoming mandatory until
December 1981 because of JEA's very limited and new asset base. JEA
revalued its end-1980 assets on the basis of an engineering revaluation.
Partly because of the inevitable lag in the utilization of capacity and the
rapid growth in electricity assets to satisfy the demand, JEA earned a
return on the book value of assets of only 6.1 percent in 1977, 4.8 percent
in 1978 and 4.6 percent in 1979. However, despite the lower than expected
rates of return and the high rate of investment, JEA continued to meet a
reasonable portion of its investment requirements from internally generated
funds, averaging 24 percent during 1977-79. The Bank, noting that this met
the basic objective of the covenant, has accepted this as satisfactory
performance. With substantial tariff increases in March 1980, making
Jordan's power among the most expensive in the Middle East, JEA's rate of
return in 1980 increased to about 8.9 percent of the book value of net
fixed assets (see para. 34). With the tariff increase and the expanding
transmission and distribution facilities resulting in a larger customer
base, JEA is expected to earn a return of 11.6 percent on revalued net
fixed assets in 1981.
41.      Agreement was reached during negotiations to modify the rate of
return covenant under previous power projects to a cash generation
covenant. The change in revenue covenant was agreed because the financial
objectives of JEA would be maintained and in view of the Government's con-
cern that revaluation of JEA's assets under the rate of return covenant
might induce other institutions to insist on revaluing their own assets,
thereby exacerbating price pressures in the economy. It was agreed that
measures will be taken to ensure that JEA would generate from internal
sources at least 25 percent of its investment requirements in 1981, 1982
and 1983 and 35 percent in 1984 and thereafter (Section 4.03 of the JEA
Project Agreement). JEA would review with the Government at least three
months before the end of each fiscal year the adequacy of JEA's projected
revenues and the measures to be implemented by JEA to comply with the
self-financing ratio in the following fiscal year and consult the Bank
prior to the beginning of the following fiscal year, on such measures
(Section 4.04 of the JEA Project Agreement). These levels of internal cash
generation are considered satisfactory because of the Government decision



- 16 -
requiring JEA to absorb in 1981, the 50 percent increase in fuel price
implemented in February 1981. This would give JEA sufficient time to
undertake a tariff review, scheduled for completion in July 1981, which
might lead to a general restructuring of tariffs. For 1981, the Government
is considering allowing JEA to keep the Fils 1.00 per kWh it collects for
the Rural Electrification Fund and Fils 1.00 per kWh it collects in taxes,
or some other equivalent budgetary measures, to compensate partially for
the Fils 5.00 per kWh increase (or an aggregate increase of 27 percent) in
JEA's operating costs caused by the fuel price increase. To achieve the
agreed self-financing ratios in subsequent years, the Government and JEA
would take appropriate measures, including restructuring of tariffs, to
increase the average revenue per kWh sold by 11 percent in 1982, 15 percent
in 1983, 6 percent in 1984 and 14 percent in 1985 (assuming a 3 percent
real increase per annum in the price of fuel). With these revenue
increases, the comparable rate of return on revalued assets would be
7.6 percent in 1982, gradually increasing to 8.9 percent in 1985.
42.      JEA's accounts receivable are satisfactory, amounting to the
equivalent of 6 weeks' billings. JEA has so far maintained a prudent
capital structure with a debt/equity ratio of less than 1:1; however, in
view of the need to limit JEA's borrowing to prudent levels, JEA has agreed
not to incur additional debt without the Bank's prior approval unless its
debt service coverage ratio was at least 1.5 (Section 4.05 of the JEA
Project Agreement). JEA's future financial situation is expected to be
satisfactory. JEA is expected to finance almost 26 percent of its 1981-85
development program of $553 million with internally-generated funds. JEA's
accounts are audited by a local firm of chartered accountants (Shair &
Co.). The auditing arrangements are satisfactory and JEA agreed during
negotiations to an audit covenant similar to the one included under the
third power project (Loan 1688-JO) (Section 4.02 of the JEA Project
Agreement).
43.      Organization, Management and Staffing of JEPCO.  JEPCO is largely
an investor-owned company (para. 27). Its Board consists of eleven
members, two of them nominated by the Government and 9 elected by the
shareholders. The Board, under the direction of the Chairman and General
Manager, decides policy. Day-to-day management is the responsibility of
the Deputy General Manager. JEPCO does not have a separate Finance Depart-
ment and the financial planning is at present handled by its consultants
(Kennedy & Donkin - UK). The accounting section is weak, having no staff
with any formal training in accounting or finance. Improvements are needed
in JEPCO's organizational structure and operations to enhance the quality
of its service and efficiency. An adequate management information system
needs to be established and improvements are needed in billing procedures.
JEPCO has, therefore, agreed to employ by December 31, 1981, consultants
specialized in power utilities to review by December 31, 1982, JEPCO's
organization, management practices and billing system and to propose neces-
sary changes to be implemented promptly thereafter (Section 3.02 of the



- 17 -
JEPCO Project Agreement). At the end of 1980, JEPCO had 1,215 employees of
which 782 were in operations. JEPCO has slightly higher salaries than JEA,
and has also decided to provide additional monetary and other benefits to
be able to retain its professional and skilled staff. JEPCO's training
programs are being carried out in cooperation with the Education Ministry
and are directed toward training of skilled personnel for overhead line
construction, and technical specialties. These programs would need to be
expanded to include engineering, accounting and managerial staff. JEPCO
has agreed to prepare and send to the Bank by December 31, 1981, a detailed
staff training program and to implement the program in accordance with a
schedule agreed with the Bank (Section 3.04 of the JEPCO Project Agree-
ment). JEPCO has also agreed to prepare and send to the Bank by March 31,
1982 for its review and comments a plan to develop JEPCO's technical and
financial planning capabilities and to implement the plan thereafter in
consultation with the Bank (Section 3.03 of the JEPCO Project Agreement).
44.      Financial Performance and Prospects of JEPCO.  JEPCO's Concession
Agreement provides for tariffs being maintained at a level to enable JEPCO
to earn enough to provide dividends of not less than an average of 7.5 per-
cent of the nominal value of the shares over 5-year periods starting in
April 1963. If an increase in tariffs is necessary for JEPCO to earn the
minimum 7.5 percent, then such an increase cannot exceed a level that would
result in a pre-tax return on nominal value of the shares over 16 percent.
Between 1977 and 1979, JEPCO earned an average return on net fixed assets
of about 11.4 percent before taxes (or 6.1 percent after tax). During this
period, JEPCO's debt-equity ratio was less than 1:2 and debt service cover-
age was higher than 1.5. However, JEPCO had large accounts payable and its
receivables amounted to between 58 and 78 days' billings at the end of 1978
and 1979 respectively, due largely to delinquent Government accounts. The
departments are making bona fide efforts to pay their bills. JEPCO con-
firmed during negotiations that overdue accounts were significantly reduced
in FY80. During negotiations, it was agreed that the Government would
cause its Departments to pay all outstanding electricity bills due to JEPCO
by September 1, 1981 and thereafter to pay their electric bills within 6
weeks (Section 4.02 of the Loan Agreement).
45.      JEPCO's future financial situation is expected to be satis-
factory. Between 1981 and 1985, JEPCO is expected to earn between 9 and 16
percent return (7-11 percent after tax) on net unrevalued assets. Earnings
per share would range between 17 and 34 percent of the shares' nominal
value. The debt service coverage ratio will be more than 1.5 during 1981-
1985. JEPCO's Concession Agreement links tariffs primarily to dividend
payments, and hence it is necessary to assure an adequate internal cash
generation for financing its investment program. Therefore, during nego-
tiations, the Government and JEPCO agreed to adjust JEPCO's tariffs as
needed to enable JEPCO to maintain a self-financing ratio of at least 25
percent after dividend payments in 1982 and 1983 and 35 percent thereafter,
based on its average capital expenditures for electricity operation for the
year in question and the preceding year (Sections 4.03 of the Loan Agree-
ment and 4.03 of the JEPCO Project Agreement). JEPCO would review with the
Government at least three months before the end of each fiscal year
regarding the adequacy of JEPCO's projected revenues and the measures to be



- 18 -
implemented by JEPCO to comply with the self-financing ratio in the
following fiscal year and consult the Bank prior to the beginning of the
following fiscal year on such measures (Section 4.04 of the JEPCO Project
Agreement). JEPCO also agreed not to incur any additional debt without
agreement with the Bank unless the debt service coverage ratio was at least
1.5 (Section 4.05 of the JEPCO Project Agreement).
46.      JEPCO's Investment Program.  On the basis of projected tariffs,
JEPCO would finance 25 percent of its 1981-85 capital requirements of
$120.8 million from internal cash generation. To meet part of its expendi-
tures JEPCO has sold about 1 million shares to JEA at JD 1.75 per share.
This additional equity capital of JD 1.75 million ($5.8 million) would
cover about 5 percent of JEPCO's investment program. About 70 percent of
the investment requirements would be met from borrowings, of which 41 per-
cent, pertaining primarily to downstream investments in 1985, have not yet
been identified. A third of the unidentified portion of the total borrow-
ing assumed relates to JEPCO's 1985 construction requirements. JEPCO is
expected to identify these sources when it updates its current financing
plan.
47.      Accounts and Audit.  JEPCO's accounts are audited annually by a
local firm of chartered accountants (Khadder, Ramadan and Co.). JEPCO has
agreed that independent auditors acceptable to the Bank would continue to
audit JEPCO's financial statements which would be sent to the Bank within
four months after the end of the fiscal year (Section 4.02 of the JEPCO
Project Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing Plan
48.      The estimated cost of the project, excluding interest during con-
struction estimated at $5.46 million, is $81.1 million of which $51.7
million (or 64 percent) would be in foreign exchange. The average cost per
connected consumer under the rural electrification component is estimated
at *600. The project goods and works are exempt from import duties and
taxes. Physical contingencies have been assumed at 7 percent for civil
works and 5 percent for equipment. Price contingencies have been estimated
at 9 percent in 1981, 8.5 percent in 1982 and 7.5 percent during 1983-85.
About 300 manmonths of consultants' services would be provided at an
estimated average cost per manmonth of about $11,500, including all
expenses.
49.      The proposed Bank loan of $25 million would be made to the Govern-
ment, which coordinates all foreign financing for public sector projects
through its National Planning Council. The loan would amount to about 31
percent of the total project costs and about 48 percent of the foreign
exchange costs. The Bank loan would be made on standard Bank terms appli-
cable to Jordan--17 years including 4 years of grace. The Government would
on-lend $5 million to JEA and $20 million to JEPCO on the same terms as the
Bank loan, under separate Subsidiary Loan Agreements, with each power
entity bearing the foreign exchange risk on its portion of the loan
(Section 3.01(c) of the Loan Agreement). Ratification of the Subsidiary
Loan Agreements is a condition of loan effectiveness (Section 6.01 of



- 19 -
the Loan Agreement). Project financing, aggregating to $7 million with
$4.2 million in foreign exchange, would be contributed by the Jordan Valley
Authority and Jordan Industrial Estate (Sahab) Corporation. In addition
the Kuwait Fund loan of KD 5 million (about $18 million) would be provided
to JEA through the Government for the construction of transmission lines
and the extension of substations under Part A of the project. The rest of
the project costs, including the $5.46 million required to meet interest
during construction, would be financed from Government, JEA and JEPCO
resources.
Disbursements and Procurement
50.      The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed against 100
percent of the foreign exchange cost or 100 percent of the local ex-factory
cost of locally-manufactured goods for urban distribution, rural electrifi-
cation and low-cost housing power supply, and 100 percent of the foreign
exchange cost for consultants' services and training. About $2 million
would be disbursed in FY82, $8 million in FY83, $11 million in FY84, $3
million in FY85 and $1 million in FY86. Retroactive financing, aggregating
no more than $400,000, is proposed to finance foreign expenditures required
for consultants' services incurred after January 1, 1981.
51.      Procurement for works and goods to be financed by the proposed
Bank loan would be through international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement. Bidding documents for equipment
and works are being prepared by the consultants. Civil works and equipment
contracts would be grouped to the extent possible to ensure effective
international competition. Local participation is expected in contracts
containing construction and erection works and local manufacturing of some
equipment for rural electrification and distribution networks is likely.
In the evaluation of civil works and equipment bids, a preference equal to
15 percent or actual import duties, whichever is less, would be granted to
local manufacturers.
Project Justification
52.      The proposed project is part of the 1981-84 network development
programs of JEA and JEPCO and constitutes an important stage in the
development of the Jordan power system. Specifically, the project would
serve five municipal and industrial load centers from the national grid,
reinforcing substation capacity at five important load centers, and help
electrify about 50 villages with a total of 23,000 inhabitants and three
low-cost housing areas being developed for 28,000 inhabitants. The project
is the least-cost alternative based on a study of technical alternatives of
all the project's discrete elements, except for the reinforcement of the
132-kV Amman ring for which no practical technical alternative exists.
53.      The rate of return for the entire power subsector program for
1981-85, of which this project forms an integral part, is about 21 per-
cent. The rate of return on the rural electrification component, calcu-
lated on the basis of quantifiable benefits, is about 9 percent. The rate
of return on supplying power to the low-cost housing scheme is about 16
percent.



- 20 -
Project Risks and Environmental Aspects
54.      No particular project risks are envisaged.  The project is likely
to have little adverse impact on the environment as it consists of power
transmission and distribution and rural electrification. The transmission
lines will cross desert and mountainous areas with few inhabitants and
little agricultural activity. JEA and JEPCO would pay appropriate atten-
tion to the aesthetic appearance of project facilities and their compati-
bility with the environment. Possible adverse visual impact will be
reduced to a minimum by use of selected types of transmission line poles,
including tubular pole design near urban centers, and by suitable routing
of overhead lines. In addition, the social environment will be enhanced by
bringing public lighting to areas which do not yet have power supply.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the Jordan
Electricity Authority, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the
Jordanian Electric Power Company, and the draft Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Bank are being distributed separately. Special conditions of the proj-
ect are listed in Section III of Annex III. As indicated in the text and
in Section III of Annex III of this report, an additional condition of
effectiveness is the ratification of the Subsidiary Loan Agreements
(Section 6.01 of the Loan Agreement).
56.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
57.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 534: Second Education Project; US$6.0 Million Credit of March 12,
1975; Date of Effectiveness: June 2, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
The project is designed to expand vocational and technical education,
to promote quality improvements in secondary education by replacing uneco-
nomically small rented school buildings and providing schools with adequate
workshops, and to support integrated rural development projects in the Jordan
Valley through a pilot scheme of non-formal basic education. The project
includes construction, furniture and equipment for the following institu-
tions: a Polytechnic at Irbid; a trade training complex at Aqaba; a Hotel
Training School at Amman; three comprehensive secondary schools; extension of
preparatory and secondary schools (seven pre-vocational workshops; five
science laboratories, four women's craft centers); and a rural development
center. Construction work on 5 of the 7 new institutions is about 3 years
behind schedule due to initial delays in selecting project consultants and
bankruptcy of the contractors. The construction is expected to be completed
by fall 1981. The extensions to 16 preparatory and secondary schools has been
completed. Furniture and equipment procurement is complete. Classes have
already begun at the Trade Training complex and at the Hotel Training school.
Technical assistance being provided by UNDP and ODM is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 639: Tourism Project; US$6.0 Million Credit of August 12, 1976; Date
of Effectiveness: July 15, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
The project includes the construction of tourist accommodation and
related facilities near the Petra Entrance, and the construction of visitor
facilities and archaeological preservation works in the Petra Basin as well as
the resettlement of about 96 Bedouin families currently living in the Basin.
The Project also provides for visitor facilities, infrastructure, archaeo-
logical preservation works at Jerash, and technical assistance. Schematic
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

plans and cost estimates for the Petra Entrance Facilities, including staff
housing are under preparation. Procurement of the first lot of equipment is
proceeding on schedule and bids for the Bedouin resettlement housing have been
reviewed by the Association and implementation would be by Jordan Housing
Corporation. The civil works contract has been awarded and archaeological
work on both sites is proceeding satisfactorily with assistance from UNESCO.
Construction activity, which was slowed down due to poor weather, to the dis-
covery of several tombs at Jerash, and to the necessity for deeper excavations
than originally anticipated at Petra, has now picked up momentum.
Cr. No. 780: Third Amman Water Supply and Sewerage Project: US$14.0 Million
Credit of May 19, 1978; Date of Effectiveness: October 17,
1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
The project is part of the on-going 1978-81 program of the Amman
Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA), to expand water supply and sewerage
services in Amman, including those areas where the urban poor reside. The
project consists of the construction of approximately 207 km of water and 225
km of sewerage mains, laterals and house connections, a 4,000 m3 reservoir,
15,000 meters and related equipment, and training. The improved sewerage ser-
vices resulting from the project would help protect groundwater resources in
the Amman area from pollution. Overall physical implementation of the proj-
ect is proceeding satisfactorily. Construction of the Azraq transmission line
was completed in October 1980 and pumping at a rate of about 1,250 m3/hour
was initiated. In order to use the additional Azraq volume of water effec-
tively, distribution through the Tadj pumping station will be necessary. The
scope of the contract is being revised accordingly and construction is
expected to be completed by end-1981. AWSA's recently appointed financial
manager, together with USAID-financed technical assistance personnel, are
preparing work program designed to strengthen AWSA's financial operations.
Loan 1617:    The Arab Potash Project; US$35 Million Loan of October 21, 1978;
Date of Effectiveness: May 30, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1984.
The project is the largest industrial project ($428 million total
cost) ever undertaken in Jordan and is aimed at producing 1.2 million tons of
potash from Dead Sea brine via solar evaporation. The project consists of a
solar evaporation and brine transfer system, a harvesting system, a refinery,
infrastructure facilities and an associated township. All the major contracts
for the project have been awarded. The revised capital cost estimates indi-
cate a 7-percent increase due to higher than anticipated cost of the
mechanical works contract and the inclusion of screening and compacting
facilities. Overall project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily and
on schedule.

Loan 1688:    Third Power Project; US$15 Million Loan of May 4, 1979; Date of
Effectiveness: October 11, 1979; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The Third Power Project is an integral part of Jordan's 1979-82 Power
Development Program whose long range objective is to progressively inter-
connect the Northern, Central and Southern regions of Jordan into an economic
and reliable national power system. Specifically, the project would supply
the power needs of the potash complex at Ghor Safi, the phosphate rock mining
works at El Hassa, the cement plant at Rashadiya and rural distribution loads
in Central Jordan. Contracts for transmission lines, substations, power
transformers, rural electrification and power line carriers have been con-
cluded and approved by the concerned authorities. Physical implementation of
the project is proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan 1781:    Third Education Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of January 21,
1980; Date of Effectiveness: March 12, 1980; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
The project is designed to assist the Government in training skilled
manpower required in implementing the economic development plan, improving the
quality of education and enhancing the Ministry of Education's management
capabilities. The project would expand technician and vocational training,
increase the supply of teachers, improve agricultural education, expand adult
education, upgrade school building maintenance and establish a computerized
management information system in the Ministry of Education. Preparation of
construction bid documents is almost complete and bids are to be invited dur-
ing the next three months--a few months behind schedule. Bids for the hard-
ware and software for the management information system are under review.
Procurement of furniture and equipment is proceeding on schedule. All aspects
of project implementation are proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan 1826:    Cities and Villages Development Bank (CVDB) Project; US$l0
Million Loan of September 8, 1980; Date of Effectiveness:
March 31, 1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
The project would help establish CVDB as a development bank for
municipalities and villages, and provides a line of credit to finance eligible
subprojects over a two year period. It also includes a technical assistance
component to (i) train CVDB staff; (ii) undertake a study of the ways and
means of increasing productive projects in local communities; and (iii) pro-
vide an advisor to assist CVDB's management. Recruitment of staff was delayed
but is now proceeding satisfactorily.

The project includes (a) provision of about 5,000 plots under three
sites and services schemes benefitting about 41,000 persons with low- to
middle-income; (b) upgrading of four low-income settlements in the City of
Amman; (c) small business assistance and manpower training; (d) consultancy
services for project management, design and supervision and studies; and (e)
