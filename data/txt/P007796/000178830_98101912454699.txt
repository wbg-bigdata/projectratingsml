PROJECT PERFORMANCE AIUDIT REPORT
PANAMA: SECOND POWER (BAYANO) PROJECT
(LOAN 661-PAN)
PREFACE
This report presents the results of a performance audit of
the Second Power Project in Panama, for which a loan of US$42 million
(Loan 661-PAN) was made to Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y Electri-
ficacion (IRHE) in March 1970. The Loan became effective in July 1970
and was closed in June 1977.
The Project Performance Audit Report consists of a Memorandum
Prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED), and a Project
Completion Report (PCR) prepared by the Latin America and Caribbean
Regional Office. OED has reviewed the PCR against the Appraisal Report
and other documents and discussed the project with Bank staff. The
audit basically concurs with the findings of the PCR, and the Memorandum
examines in greater detail the delay in preparing the project and the
financial difficulties encountered by the Borrower.
An OED mission visited Panama for three days in November 1978.
Discussions were held with the staff of IRHE and the Gorgas Memorial
Laboratory and additional information was obtained. The findings of that
mission are reflected in the audit memorandum. The valuable assistance
provided by the staff of IRHE and the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory is
gratefully acknowledged.
Following normal procedures, a copy of this Project Performance
Audit Report was sent to the Government and the Borrower for comments.
However, none were received.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
PANAMA: SECOND POWER (BAYANO) PROJECT
(Loan 661-PAN)
Highlights
Lban 661-PAN, for the Second.Power Project in Panama, was made
in 1970 after the Bank had pre-appraised the project in 1965. The delay
was due to the need for institutional reforms of IRHE and to the concern
by the Bank about the marketing of the power from Bayano. By the end of
1969, certain regulations of the power sector in Panama had changed.
Satisfied with the new regulations and management improvements, the Bank
considered that lending for Bayano was justified.
The project is helping to meet the increase in sales of energy
which grew at about the same rate as forecast at appraisal. However,
there was a delay of about 19 months in constructing the Bayano hydro-
electric plant, which formed the main component of the project, and there
were substantial cost overruns. The audit estimates the incremental
financial rate of return (IFRR) on the project to be about 18%. No IFRR
was calculated at appraisal.
The borrower's financial performance deteriorated after 1971,
and IRHE did not comply with some of the Loan covenants. In part, the
power sector's problems reflect the various economic crises which affected
the overall economy, but additionally, the difficulties stem from the
high cost overrun on the Bayano project.
In making the loan, the Bank also had certain important
institutional objectives. Progress towards meeting these objectives was
satisfactory. However, IRHE's role changed significantly when the Govern-
ment nationalized Compania Panamena de Fuerza y Luz in 1972, and the need
for further organizational improvement became apparent. These improve-
ments, including training needs, are being implemented in connection with
the Third and Fourth Power Projects financed by the Bank.
Points of special interest are:
- reasons for delay in project preparation (PPAM paras. 3,
11-15, and PCR paras. 2.1.1-2.1.2 and 2.2.1-2.2.2);
- the Bank's strategy for safeguarding sector finances prior
to the nationalization of FyL (PPAM para. 9 and PCR paras.
2.1.5, 2.2.2, and 6.1.2(ii));
- reasons for cost overruns and time delays in implementa-
tion (PPAM paras. 3-4, 21, and PCR paras. 3.1.1-3.3.5, 3.5
and 6.1.2(i));



(v)
reasons for deteriorating financial performance and
the effect of the project's cost overrun on IRHE's
finances (PPAM paras. 8, 16-22, and PCR para. 4.1);
need for prequalifications of bidders (PPAM
paras. 4, 28, and PCR paras. 3.8.1-3.8.2 and
7.1.3);
measures taken to reduce adverse effects on the
ecology and the environment of the project (PPAM
paras. 10, 22-25, and PCR paras. 2.1.3-2.1.4, and
3.3.6).



PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
PANAMA: SECOND POWER (BAYANO) PROJECT
(Loan 661-PAN)
SECTION I
PROJECT SUMMARY
1.           The Bank has provided financial assistance to the Panamanian
Power sector since 1962 through four loans 1/ to Instituto de Recursos
Hidraulicos y Electrificacion (IRHE), an autonomous agency of the Government.
IHRE was created in 1961 and given the exclusive right to develop the hydro
resources of the country. In July 1969, a new law was created charging
IHRE with the exclusive right to construct and operate all new sources of
generation in Panama. In 1972, IRHE became the major institution in the
power sector after the Government nationalized the Compania Panamena de
Fuerza y Luz (FyL) which previously was the largest electricity distributor
in the country (PCR paras. 1.2.1 and 6.1.2(ii)). IRHE is now responsible
for about 98% of the public service capacity installed.
2.        Loan 661-PAN, which forms the subject of this audit, was for
US$42 million, to cover the foreign exchange component of the Second Power
Project which, at appraisal, had an expected total cost of US$58.3 million.
The project consisted mainly of the construction of the 300 MW Bayano
hydroelectric development, with an initial installation of two 75 MW units;
the installation of a 40 MW steam.unit (No. 4) at Las Minas; the construc-
tion of transmission lines associated with the power plants; distribution
system expansion in various isolated systems; and consulting services (PCR
para. 2.4).
3.        Initially, the Bank had sent a mission to appraise the Bayano
project in 1965, but, being concerned that IRHE had not reached a sales
agreement with FyL and the Panama Canal Company (Pancanal) 2/ and had also
not hired management consultants (Section II), the appraisal was not
completed (PCR paras. 2.1.1-2.12). Actual appraisal took place in July
1969, the loan was approved in March 1970 and became effective in July 1970
(PCR paras. 2.2.1 -2.2.2). Loan disbursement was completed in mid-1977.
(Actual and forecast disbursements are shown in tabular form in PCR, Annex
3a. They are also shown at the bottom of the Data Sheet). The final
project cost was about US$109.7 million, i.e., around 88% higher than
envisaged at appraisal. The cost overrun was due mainly to an underesti-
mation of the base cost of the Bayano hydro station at the time of appraisal
1/ For a total amount of US$118 million.
2/ Pancanal is a U.S. Government agency supplying electricity to the Canal
Zone and is free to construct its own generating plant. Pancanal's
installed capacity is about 160 MW. A tie line between the Canal Zone
and the Metropolitan System serves for the exchange of power (PCR
Annex 4, page 1, footnote 3).

and unexpectedly high inflation during the longer-than expected con-
struction period (PCR paras. 3.5.1-3.5.3). The cost overrun was financ-
ed mostly by IRHE through short- and medium- term commercial borrowings,
and also by the Government and suppliers' credits (PCR paras. 3.5.4.
and 4.1.2(i)).
4.        The Bayano hydro station, the largest component of the project,
was completed some nineteen months behind schedule. The delay in the
implementation of the other items in the project, ranging from five to nine
months, was not critical. The main reasons for delay of Bayano were: i) an
initial implementation schedule which appears to have been unrealistic;
ii) change of consulting engineers and consequent revision of the project
design and construction schedule; iii) revision of bidding documents, which
delayed the bid opening for the main civil works contract; and iv) difficulties
experienced with the main civil works contractor (PCR paras. 3.1.1-3.3.5 and
3.8.2). For the Fourth Power Project, IRHE has required pre-qualifications
of bidders, following a lesson which emerged from the experience of this
project (PCR para. 7.1.3).
5.        On the basis of an anticipated growth in sales of 11.2% p.a.
through 1976, it was expected at appraisal that the first two hydro units
at Bayano would be needed by the second half of 1975. Commissioning of the
steam unit at Las Minas was thought to be required by the early part of
1974. At the time of appraisal, comparisons between the Bayano hydro
station up to full development (i.e. 4 x 75 MW) and an equivalent thermal
development were carried out by discounting the cost streams over a period
of 60 years. The analysis showed that the Bayano project would be more
economic than the thermal alternative for discount rates of less than 16%,
and that 75 MW was the most economic unit size. Since appraisal, IRHE has
revised its future needs for capacity and the installation of the third and
fourth unit at Bayano are no longer the least cost next step in the develop-
ment program as other hydro sources have been identified. However, the
recalculation of the appraisal comparison, using only two 75MW units at
Bayano instead of four, shows that it continues to be more economical
than a thermal alternative for discount rates up to 24% (PCR para. 4.3.1)
despite the cost overrun. The result is, of course, due to the fact that
the cost of oil for thermal operations has increased drastically since the
time the original comparison was made. The appraisal report did not
calculate a rate of return on the Bayano project, but the audit estimates
the incremental financial rate of return on the project in retrospect,
including transmission and distribution work and the steam unit at Las
Minas, to be about 18% (see attached table).
6.        At present the installed capacity of IRHE's metropolitan system
is about 400MW and the maximum demand is about 225 MW. In addition to the
two 75 MW units at Bayano, IRHE's next largest units comprise the three 40
MW steam generators at Las Minas, two units of about 25 MW and two of about
15 MW at San Francisco, and some smaller thermal units having an installed
capacity of less than 10 MW each. During the past two years IRHE has had
problems with some units at Las Minas and San Francisco, which have been out



-3 -
of service for as long as nine months in a year. Because of the problems
with the thermal units, IRHE is experiencing difficulties in scheduling
maintenance of the two.units at Bayano, which are used for base load, and
have expressed the view that installation of three 50 MW units at Bayano
rather   than the two of 75 MW each would have provided the system with
more flexibility, albeit at a somewhat higher capital investment. However,
when the Fortuna hydro project is completed in the early 1980s, this
problem should be eased.
7.        During the 1970-76 period total power sales in the metropolitan
system had an average growth rate of 11.4% compared to 11.2% envisaged
at appraisal. The delay in implementing the project affected the economy
of Panama as load shedding became necessary and quite frequent (lasting for
as long as nine hours at a time) the year before Bayano came on line.
However, IRHE additionally had problems with some of its steam units at San
Francisco and Las Minas, which also contributed to the forced load shedding
during that year. Nevertheless, oil imports would have been lower in 1976
by at least US$10 million if the units at Bayano had been finished on time,
as IRHE could have reduced production from some of its less efficient
thermal plants.
8.        The cost overrun on the project had an adverse effect on IRHE's
finances. As the company was not allowed to increase its tariff level
(except to cover increased fuel cost), and Government contributions were
delayed, IRHE resorted to shortr and medium- term borrowing to finance
the cost overrun on the project. After 1973, the 8-3/4% rate of return
on assets agreed to in the loan documents was not met (PCR paras. 4.1.1-
4.1.2 and Annex 1), and the company's low earnings were such that
internal cash generation even failed to cover all debt service for about
four years during the 1970-76 period. The Bank made frequent representa-
tions to the Government between 1974 and 1977 about the need to approve
tariff increases and for the Government to finance the cost overrun on the
Bayano project. The Government at that time was faced by strong constraints
on its ability to increase tariffs and to make capital contributions. Bank
financing of the cost overrun was, at one time, considered in the Bank but
rejected (PPAM Section II).
9.        A major Bank objective during the preparation and appraisal of
the project was to strengthen IRHE's institutional performance.     At the
Bank's request, IRHE therefore hired management consultants, Stone and
Webster (S&W) in December 1965 to review its problems. Implementation
of the consultants' recommendations was an important element before apprais-
ing the project (PCR paras. 2.1.2-2.1.3 and 2.2.1). To ensure the future
successful operation of the project, the Bank included in the loan an
amount for financing training programs, to be established jointly by IRHE
and the consultants. The programs, as implemented, were based upon the
on-site training of personnel working closely with the consultants and are
regarded by IRHE and the Bank as having produced satisfactory results. In
mid-1972, IRHE's role changed significantly when the Government nationalized



- 4 -
FyLl/, and the need for further organizational improvements including a
need for further training became apparent.    These improvements and training
needs have been identified and are being implemented in connection with the
Third and Fourth Power Projects financed by the Bank (PCR paras. 5.2.1 -
5.2.2).
10.          At appraisal, no report on the potential environmental impact of
the Bayano project was carried out. In 1973, the Bank hired a consultant who
recommended deforestation of the impoundment area and resettlement of the
local population. IRHE carried out successfully the latter recommendation
but not all the trees in the impoundment area were cut down and removed.
Failure to do so resulted in rapid proliferation of water weeds and has
caused some minor operating difficulties at the power station (PCR paras.
2.1.4, 3.3.6 and PPAM paras. 22-25).
SECTION II
MAIN ISSUES
A. Project Preparation
11.       When a feasibility study of the Bayano hydroelectric project was
completed by the International Engineering Company (IECO) in late 1963,
IRHE requested a Bank loan to finance the project. The cost estimate of
about US$62 million was considered at the time to be high and raised doubts
within the Bank as to whether the Bayano project was competitive with an
alternative thermal power development. IRHE subsequently contracted the
Harza Engineering Company (Harza) to review the project cost, which was
re-estimated in late 1964 at the much lower figure of about US$40 million.
On this basis, it became apparent that the Bayano project was an economic
source for meeting the expected energy requirements of the early 1970's.
12.       In 1965, when the Bank first initiated appraisal of the pro-
ject, there were two particular areas which caused the Bank some concern,
and which made it subsequently decide to postpone the full appraisal of
Bayano. Firstly, no contract had been negotiated with FyL and Pancanal2/
in respect of the quantities and prices for the power which IRHE would sell
from Bayano. Secondly, the Bank had become conscious (through supervision
of the First Power Project) of the need for institutional reforms of IRHE.
13.       Since 1917, FyL had a concession to supply the whole of Panama
with electricity although in fact it chose to confine its operations to
Panama City and Colon only. IRHE was created by Law 37 in 1961 and cons-
tructed a 7 MW hydro plant and some small diesel units in the western and
central part of Panama (financed by Bank loan 322-PAN). At the same time,

in PCR paras. 2.1.5, 2.2.2 and 6.1.2 (ii).
2/ The only two companies in the metropolitan area which at the time
had the facilities and market to transmit and distribute the power
from Bayano.



- 5 -
IRHE was assigned the exclusive right to develop the hydro resources of
the country, thereby restricting to some degree the expansion of the
private companies. However, the private companies remained in principle
free to construct and operate thermal units. Nevertheless, IRHE rather
than FyL was granted permission in 1966 to build a 40 MW steam unit at Las
Minas. IRHE's role as wholesaler to private retailers was eventually fully
established in 1969 when the Government passed a decree (No. 235) to
replace Law No. 37 and gave IRHE the sole right to construct and operate
all new sources of generation in the country. The Bank was satisfied with
this new structure of the power sector and finally agreed to finance the
Bayano project in 1970.
14.           The Bank had good reasons for being concerned at the time
about IRHE's need for institutional reforms. Although IRHE was created
as an autonomous state-owned agency, it did not have sufficient autonomy
to manage itself and control its own budget. For example, the Board of
Directors had powers to interfere in the daily operations of the entity
and did so. At the Bank's instance, therefore, IRHE hired S&W in late
1965 to review its management and organization and to recommend changes.
In 1966, the consultants produced an organizational report recommending
management improvements. This report and subsequent discussions with the
Bank, IRHE and the Government led to the change in the law in 1969, which
provided a satisfactory basis for IRHE to operate as an autonomous
entity.
15.           Thus, about four years elapsed between the time the Bank
originally sent a mission to appraise Bayano and final appraisal of the
project in 1969. IRHE was slow in implementing the recommendations of the
management consultants but felt that the Bank was being unduly concerned
about the sales contract between FyL and IRHE, and in consequence the
delay in obtaining Bank financing was viewed in Panama as protecting a
profitable foreign corporation and preventing IRHE from entering the
metropolitan area. The Bank was understandably concerned about IRHE's
management but rather than focussing so much on the issue of the sales
contract might perhaps have concentrated more, during the preparation of
this project in 1965, on the regulation of the sector as a whole. Ulti-
mately, this was the approach adopted by the Bank towards the end of the
1960's when it was instrumental in having the law changed to ensure sound
sector regulation on a national basis. However, the delay did lead to
dissatisfaction in Panama about the Bank's role and to the use of more
costly sources of power, both of which might have been avoided had the
Bank concentrated, in the first instance, on the broader power sector
issues in Panama.
B. Financial Performance
16.       IRHE's financial performance was satisfactory through 1971 but
deteriorated thereafter. A contributing factor to the financial deteriora-
tion was the problem of overdue bills, particularly of Government agencies
beginning in 1972. The table below shows a general deterioration of the
accounts receivable situation during the 1970-76 period, with as high as 49%
of annual billings outstanding as of the end of 1972 and the Government



-6-
accounting for more than 40% of this.    In addition, the inability to
raise tariffs and the unfavorable terms of borrowing resulted in IRHE's
lack of liquidity after 1973, and, at the end of 1976, net current assets
stood at about minus B/14 million.

17.          One of the financial objectives of this project was for IRHE
to achieve a 8.75% return on assets in accordance with Panamanian Legislation.
IRHE performed well under this test through 1973, but fell short of the
stipulated rate thereafter (PCR Table IV-I). The shortfall was mainly due
to the fact that IRHE was only allowed to pass on to consumers the cost
increases in imported fuel (an increase of about 75% in electricity bills
between 1973 and 1976), but was not allowed rate increases to keep up with
the pace of general inflation affecting costs other than fuel.
18.          At the Government's request, in 1975, the Bank waived the rate
of return requirement for the period 1974-1976 on the understanding that
the Government (i) would pay in cash all its outstanding 1/ electricity
bills to IRHE; (ii) make prompt payments in cash of such bills in the
future; (iii) provide IRHE with the funds needed to complete the Bayano
hydro electric plant; (iv) compensate IRHE partially for income lost as a
result of the postponement of electricity rate increases; and (v) authorize
IRHE to increase electricity rates. IRHE, on the other hand, was (i) to
initiate a study of its structure of marginal costs and electricity rates by
August 31, 1975; (ii) to introduce a new electricity rate structure, based
on this study, by January 1, 1976, (iii) to avoid short- and medium- term
borrowing unless the Bank otherwise agreed; and (iv) to formulate a system
of automatic annual revaluations of its fixed assets, which would commence
no later than October 31, 1975. It was hoped that the implementation of
these agreements would strengthen IRHE's organization and finances.
19.          The Government and IRHE were slow in implementing the above
plan. Outstanding electricity bills from the Government remained a problem
for a time, but has now been resolved. The Government was slow in increasing

its capital contribution and agreed to IRHE's financing the cost overrun on
the Bayano project by short- and medium-term borrowing from commercial
banks.  Gradual tariff increases started only in January 1977.     IRHE and
the consultants have yet to complete the study of the marginal cost of
providing electricity. Revaluation of its fixed assets has been recorded
up to December 31, 1977, although with some delay.
20.       The Loan Agreement included a debt service covenant whereby IRHE
was not permitted to borrow without the Bank's concurrence unless net
revenues covered maximum future debt service 1.4 times. The Bank was not
always informed about IRHE's medium-term borrowing from 1974 onwards, when
it is doubtful whether IRHE would have met this test. In early 1977, the
Bank accepted the situation during the preparation of the Fourth Power
Loan. However, as conditions for making the Loan effective, the Bank
required improvements in IRHE's financial performance, e.g., gradual tariff
increases and timely payments of government electricity bills.
21.       The Bank made frequent representations to the Government between
1974 and 1977 about the need to approve tariff increases and for the
Government to finance the cost overrun on the Bayano Project. The Govern-
ment's unwillingness to help finance the cost overrun reflected the lack
of foreign exchange and its general economic policies, i.e., to step
up the tempo of investments in other sectors which it considered of higher
priority in terms of providing a quicker stimulus to the depressed domestic
economy. When the Bank extended a third loan to IRHE, in 1973, the revised
cost of the Bayano project was already estimated to be about 35% higher
than the appraisal estimate. However, at that time IRHE's finances were
such that there was no case for rephasing the third project or reducing
its scope to provide financing for the cost overrun on Bayano. By the end
of 1974, the cost overrun of the project was estimated at about 53%.
The final cost of the project was about US$109.7 million (current prices)
compared to the appraisal estimate of US$58.3 million (including price
contingencies), and about 50% of the cost overrun was on the foreign
exchange component of the project. Of the total cost overrun of about
US$51.4 million, some US$10 million was due to the under-estimation of
the base cost of the project at the time of appraisal (a shortcoming
which the Bank recognized early in the project cycle), US$36 million
was caused by inflation and the remainder is attributable to currency
fluctuations and changes in project. design (PCR paras. 3.5.1-3.5.4) 1/.
Supplemental financing for the project was considered by the Bank around
the end of 1974 but rejected. It is clearly beyond the scope of the audit
to comment on this decision, as the whole question of the financing
of cost overruns raises broad policy issues well beyond the circumstances
surrounding this particular project. The audit recognizes the Bank's
1/ An additional US$9 million has become due on the Bank loan since
the project was completed as a result of currency realignments.



- 8 -
general policy of discouraging the provision of supplementary financ-
ing for previously approved projects, and notes that, since 1974, when
Bank financed projects have been faced with cost overruns resulting
primarily from the extraordinary price escalation and currency realign-
ments, supplemental financing has normally only been extended to the
least developed and poorest countries.
C. Ecological and Environmental Impact of Bayano
22.          At appraisal, no study was made to take into consideration
the effect the Bayano hydro project would have on the ecology and the
environment. The post of an environmental advisor was created in the
Bank in the fall of 1970, but he was instructed not to deal with projects
already being processed. However, the possible effects that Bayano would
have on the people living in the reservoir area and the potential for algae
growth in the water if the timber was left standing in the impoundment
area were perceived in the Bank in the early 1970's. The Bank therefore
hired a consultant (about two years after construction had started) to look
into these matters. His report, based mainly on information provided by
the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory in Panama, Government agencies and IRHE,
recommended: i) clearing all the trees from the Bayano impoundment area,
as any trees left standing would cause increased development of aquatic
plants that eventually would interfere with the equipment and operation
of Bayano, and ii) preparing, as soon as possible, for resettlement of
the people living in the area.
23.       The resettlement was executed in what appears to have been
an exemplary fashion.l/ The range of resettlement options created, the
involvement of the people in the selection of options and in choosing
new sites, and the method of holding compensation money in escrow accounts,
redeemable only for mutually agreed upon expenditures, appear to have
been unusually conscientious and successful. IRHE engaged an experienced
full-time chief anthropologist to assist with these programs. In addition,
two more anthropologists, two sociologists, two physicians, one psychologist
and one economist led the resettlement team of fifty people. About 2,000
people were resettled.
24.          In 1973, IRHE created an emergency group which managed to
harvest all the commercial grade species of trees and which felled about
30% of the forest during the brief period (less than two years) before the
dam was closed. Some of the trees that were cut were not dry enough to be
burned and IRHE has had difficulties in removing them, as the crane which
was designed to remove the logs floating towards the intakes was too small
and lacked versatility. The uncut trees in the impoundment area are
1/ The Office of Environmental and Health Affairs (OEHA) of the Bank
intends to use IRHE's experience in relocation projects elsewhere.



causing problems today as water weeds have proliferated rapidly. As it
is difficult to establish the relationship between the flooding of a
forest and the proliferation of water weeds, it remains unknown how much
vegetation must be removed in order to retard weed growth to acceptable
rates. Weeds at Bayano now occupy full time a work force of about 30
people, and about 1,400 ha. of "Pistiastratiotes" (water-lettuce) have been
sprayed by air planes and by boats in the last three years. Decay of trees
and weeds have also caused minor corrosion of certain pieces of copper
machinery in the power house.
25.          In 1970, there was little information on how much clearing
would be desirable, and even less on the effect of reservoirs in tropical
forest regions. However, ecological and environmental studies are now
part of the Bank's requirement in preparing power projects.
SECTION III
CONCLUSIONS
26.           The physical objectives of the project were met, albeit
with delays and cost overruns. The Bayano hydro station and the steam unit
at Las Minas are now operating satisfactorily. Thus, the project is
helping to meet growing sales of electricity, and Bayano, in particular, is
helping the country to reduce its dependence on fuel imports.
27.          Progress is being made towards the institutional and financial
objectives of the project. IRHE's financial deterioration must be viewed
in the context of the severe economic difficulties which faced Panama
during part of the period of project implementation, and the fact that
IRHE's role changed significantly when the Government nationalized FyL.
The change in role also gave rise to the need for further organizational
improvements which have been identified and which are being implemented
in connection with the Fourth Power Project financed by the Bank.
28.        A significant conclusion drawn by the PCR is that pre-
qualification of bidders is desirable in the case of large civil works
contracts (PCR para. 7.1.3). The lesson is now being applied in connec-
tion with the Fourth Power Project. The audit further concludes that
the performance of the Bank during the implementation of this project
would have improved had it concentrated more on the regulation of the
power sector during the first appraisal in 1965, as it ultimately did
towards the end of the 1960's.

PANAMA: SECOND POWER PROJECT (BAYANO)
(Loan 661-PAN)
Project Completion Report
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Bank Lending to the Power Sector
1.1.1     Since its creation in 1961, the Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y
Electrificacion (IRHE) has received four Bank loans totalling US$118 million.
The first, Loan 322-PAN for US$4 million was made in 1962. The second, Loan
661-PAN for US$42 million in 1970, the object of this report, helped IRHE in
financing the 150 MW first stage of the Bayano hydroelectric plant, 40 MW of
additional capacity at the Las Minas steam plant, transmission from these
plants to Panama City, small diesel plants in the rural area, distribution,
and consulting services. The Loan and Guarantee Agreements were signed on
March 16, 1970. The third, Loan 948-PAN for US$30 million in 1973, is helping
IRHE in financing diesel generation, transmission systems, distribution, a
load dispatch center, consulting services and training. All the main project
items had been completed by the end of 1977. However, a minor portion of the
subtransmission lines and substations are expected to be completed in 1979
with a 30-month delay. The fourth, Loan 1470-PAN for US$42 million in 1977,
is assisting IRHE in financing the Fortuna hydroelectric project, transmission
systems, an organizational improvement program, and training.
1.2 The Power Sector
1.2.1     The power sector is by now almost entirely owned by the Government
which has organized it under one company, IRHE. IRHE is charged with coordi-
nating and expanding the public service electricity supply throughout the
country. In 1972, it became the major institution in the power sector after
the acquisition from Boise Cascade (USA) of the Compania Panamena de Fuerza y
Luz (FyL). Besides being the largest electricity distributor in the country,
FyL held concessions for operation of telephone and gas services in Panama
City and Colon, which were also taken over by IRHE. Since then, IRHE trans-
ferred telephone operations to the Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicaciones
and suspended gas operations, except in Panama City. IRHE's takeover of all
the responsibilities of the power sector in a short period of time has resulted
in a rapid growth. By 1977, IRHE owned about 460MW or 98% of the public
service capacity installed in Panama and covered all the provinces, except for
some few isolated areas still supplied by small private companies. An agree-
ment dated 1969 provides for power and energy sales up to 30 MW and 210 GWh
per year to the Panama Canal Company (PANCANAL). PANCANAL has a usable
installed capacity of 139 MW.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1 Origin and Preparation
2.1.1     In late 1963, following completion of a prefeasibility study of
the Bayano project by International Engineering Company (IECO - USA) -- with
financing from the Agency for International Development -- IRHE asked the



- 12 -
Bank to consider appraising the Bayano project. As the high cost estimate
(US$62.0 million) raised questions within the Bank about future tariffs and
revenues from sales to FyL, the only customer with a service area (Panama
City and Colon) able to absorb future Bayano power, IRHE contracted Harza
Engineering Company International (HARZA - USA) to perform a review of the
proj.ect cost. In late 1964, HARZA reestimated the cost of the Bayano project
at about US$40 million, which would make the project competitive with thermal
power.
2.1.2     On the basis of the lower cost estimate, and understanding that
IRHE had reached a sales agreement with FyL and the Panama Canal Company
(PANCANAL) and had hired management consultants (the need for which had been
identified during the course of Bank supervision of the First Power Project),
the Bank sent a mission to appraise the Bayano project in July 1965. As these
understandings proved incorrect, it was agreed during the mission that:
(i) the Bank would not complete an appraisal before it had been provided
with the results of negotiations with PANCANAL and FyL concerning power
contracts; and (ii) management consultants, Stone and Webster (S&W - USA),
would be hired to assist IRHE on the solution of a broad range of organiza-
tion, financial, operating, and planning problems.
2.1.3     In 1966, S&W produced a preliminary organizational report recommend-
ing management improvements. The Bank indicated that it would seek agreement
on implementation prior to negotiations. Also in 1966, IRHE hired Empresa de
Projectos Tecnicos e Industriales, S.A. (EPTISA - Spain) to carry out the
final feasibility study and preliminary designs for the Bayano project.
Completed in 1969, these studies included no recommendations on the handling
of potential environmental problems.
2.1.4     In 1973, as a result of questions raised in Panama about the poten-
tial environmental impact of the Bayano project, the Bank hired a consultant
to assess the need for measures to safeguard the local ecology. The consul-
tant prepared a report recommending deforestation of the impoundment area
to 30 meters below the low-water mark estimated for the reservoir. The
report also contained recommendations for resettlement measures of the local
population (para. 3.3.6).
2.1.5     On January 16, 1969, the Government issued Decree No. 6 establish-
ing a National Electricity, Telephone, and Gas Commission to regulate private
electric companies under the Electricity Law (Decree Law No. 31 of October 21,
1958), which had never been fully applied. Under Article 95 of the Electricity
Law, in the event of excess (or deficit) profits after 1958, the Commission
had the power to reduce (or raise) tariffs of public utilities. There were no
standards for the separate regulation of gas and telephone operations.
Between 1958 and 1968, FyL had enjoyed excess profits on its electricity
operations while generating low earnings on its telephone operations and small
losses on its gas operations. Besides establishing the Commission, Decree No.
6 exempted IRHE from regulation completely and placed the Director General of
IRHE on the Commission.



- 13 -
2.2 Appraisal, Negotiations, and Effectiveness
2.2.1     Satisfied with IRHE's progress in implementing the S&W recommenda-
tions, including the preparation of new statutes for IRHE, the Bank sent
a mission to appraise the Bayano project in July 1969. To ensure rational
and fair sector regulation and to safeguard future sector finances -- the
financial viability of FyL, IRHE's largest customer, was considered vital
for IRHE -- the mission recommended that Government be required to: (i) remove
IRHE's representative on the Commission; (ii) subject IRHE to the authority of
the Commission; (iii) establish rules for the separate regulation of telephone
and gas operations; and (iv) place all electric utility companies, public and
private, in a position to earn a return on their rate base, as provided by the
Electricity Law (8-3/4% per annum).
2.2.2     During negotiations in February 1970, the Bank, the Government,
and IRHE came to agreement on all of the above points, including the enact-
ment of legislation amending the effective date of Article 95 of the Elec-
tricity Law to January 1, 1969 (from October 21, 1958). This amendment was
supposed to prevent tariff reductions aiming toward retroactive application
of Article 95 (para. 6.1.2(ii)). The Government declared the gas industry
competitive and not subject to regulation; and issued standards (Decrees 211)
to regulate the telephone industry. The Loan Agreement became effective
July 28, 1970.
2.3 IRHE's Expansion Program
2.3.1     At the time of the appraisal for the Bayano Project, IRHE's expansion
program covered the period 1969-1976 and included:
(i) the project (see 2.4.1 below);
(ii) the 40 MW expansion at the Las Minas Steam Plant;
(iii) the 80 MW La Estrella and Los Valles hydroelectric projects;
(iv) several small diesel generating plants; and
(v)  initial investment in the Fortuna hydroelectric project.
The above expansion program was based on the load forecast prepared by IRHE
with assistance from S & W. The forecast assumed a growth rate of 11.2%
for sales in the metropolitan area of Colon and Panama City which appeared
reasonable considering that the average rate of increase in the three pre-
ceding years 1967-69 had been 14%. After execution of the program, it was
expected that IRHE would grow from a minor power enterprise engaged in rural
electrification, with 56 MW of generating capacity in 1969, to Panama's
principal wholesaler of power by 1975, with 287 MW. It was also expected that
FyL and PANCANAL would purchase, respectively, about 75% and 20% of IRHE's
generation.



- 14 -
2.3.2     Alternative plant programs to meet the demand with and without the
Bayano hydroelectric project were investigated to select the least-cost
solution. As no other feasible hydro alternatives were available at the time,
the comparison was made against equivalent thermal developments. The project,
compared to an equivalent all-thermal alternative program, represented the
least-cost expansion for discount rates of less than 16%. The sensitivity
studies indicated a 2.5% reduction in the rate equalizing both programs for a
10% increase in the costs of Bayano. The addition of small diesels in the
Central Provinces was estimated to be the least-cost expansion before the
interconnection of that region to the metropolitan area, expected to occur by
1975.
2.4 Project Description
2.4.1     The original Project consisted of:
(i) the first stage of the Bayano hydroelectric development
including the main dam, an auxiliary dam, a powerhouse
with 2 x 75 MW units (permitting future installation of
two additional units of 75 MW each), 80 km of 230 kV
transmission line to Panama City, and a receiving sub-
station;
(ii) a 40 MW steam unit (No. 4) to be installed at Las Minas
on the Atlantic coast;
(iii) a 55 km 115 kV transmission line from Bahia Las Minas to
Panama City,.
(iv) 6 MW of additional diesel capacity for the Central Provinces
and the western part of Panama Province, plus 7.5 MVA of
substation facilities;
(v) expansion of small isolated distribution systems including
the addition of small diesel units during 1970-1972;
(vi) studies for future electric power development; and
(vii) consulting services and overseas training for IRHE's staff.
2.5 Major Covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
2.5.1     Annex 1 sets forth the major covenants of the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements for Loan 661-PAN, plus an assessment of the measure of IRHE and
Government compliance with those covenants.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND COST
3.1 Project Start-up
3.1.1      Project activities started shortly after signing of the Loan Agree-
ment. In September 1970 IRHE hired the consulting firm ELECTROCONSULT (Italy)
for the design and supervision of construction of the Las Minas steam plant.
The design and procurement for the small diesels in the Central Provinces also
commenced on time. Nevertheless, the Bayano hydroelectric project had a very
slow start-up. In October 1970, because of factors set forth in paragraph
3.8.1, IRHE did not extend the contract for the final design and supervision
of construction to EPTISA. Instead, IRHE switched to Montreal Engineering
Company (MONENCO - Canada).   MONENCO started its activities in
January 1971 and recommended new site studies, including additional drilling
at the future dam location.   Subsequently, MONENCO recommended, and IRHE
accepted, limited changes in the design of the dam foundation and in the
location of the powerhouse.   The revision of the bidding documents delayed
by three months the bid opening for the main civil works contract, which was
awarded to Energoprojekt (EP-Yugoslavia). All these changes delayed the start-
up of the Bayano project by about 18 months (para. 3.3.1).
3.2 Changes to the Project
3.2.1     The scope of the project remained as described in the appraisal
report, except for:
(i) addition of a 115 kV tap-off from the Las Minas-Panama line
and a 115/13.8 kV substation at Chilibre area to supply the
IDAAN water-treatment plant; and
(ii) addition of one circulating-water channel and filtering plant
at the Las Minas steam plant.
3.2.2     During the design and implementation of the project, several changes
had to be introduced to the preliminary designs of the major items included
in the project.  The most important changes to the design of Bayano were:
(i)  new design of dam and powerhouse foundations involving an
additional concrete volume of 21,000 m3 (about 3.5% of total);
(ii) change of several steel structural elements by concrete ones
(beams and stoplogs);
(iii) installation of a laboratory. for concrete and soil testing,
a diesel generating plant and a compressor plant for the works;
and
(iv) elimination of butterfly-valves at scour vents and intakes and
replacement by gates.



- 16 -
3.2.3     The most important changes to the design of the Bayano-Panama
transmission system included the installation of two additional 115 kV bays
at the Panama substation, additional control and measurement equipment, and
modifications to foundation in the Panama substation.
3.3 Project Execution and Implementation

3.3.2     The major problems, delays, and cost overrun occurred in the Bayano
hydroelectric project while the problems in the implementation of the other
items of the project were not critical.
3.3.3     The main problems at Bayano were:
(i)  insufficient project preparation at the time of appraisal;
(ii)  lack of experience of the borrower in handling large projects;
(iii)  delays arising from the change of consulting engineers and
consequent revision of the project design and construction
schedule -
(iv)  difficulties experienced with the main civil-works contractor
(para. 3.8.2.),



- 17 -
(v) shortage of aggregate materials due to insufficient identifica-
tion of appropriate quarries;
(vi) shortage of cement due to inappropriate arrangements
for its acquisition 1/;
(vii) delays in the settlement of claims presented by
several contractors;
(viii)  the local penstock manufacturer had no experience in con-
structing and installing large diameter penstocks; and
(ix)   high world-wide inflation.
3.3.4     Many of the problems mentioned above could have been avoided by a
more careful selection of the consultants, the main contractor and some
suppliers. The main reason for contracting the original consultants (EPTISA)
was its low cost. Also, IRHE awarded the civil works contract for Bayano to
EP on the basis of a very low-priced offer 2/.
3.3.5     By mid-1975, the originally expected completion date, all the
major items except Bayano had been completed and progress was estimated
at about 72% for Bayano and about 80% for the whole project.
3.3.6     Concerning environmental measures for resettlement and deforesta-
tion (para. 2.1.4), IRHE has largely followed the recommendations of the Bank's
consultant, although not all the trees cut down in the impoundment area were
removed. This has contributed to some additional growth of water weeds. In
the last three years, IRHE has taken control measures which have required an
average expenditure of about US$0.13 million annually in capital and operating
costs.
3.4 Procurement
3.4.1     Procurement of Bank-financed items was conducted in close contact
and frequent ,communication with the Bank. No major problems were reported
during bidding and bid evaluation and some minor problems were solved satis-
factorily.
3.4.2     The main contracts awarded are listed below.   A complete list of
the contracts is included in Annex 2-a.
1/ In 1971, EP entered into an arrangement for the supply of cement from
a Panamanian company which did not have the capacity to produce the
cement in the quantity and quality required. In 1974, IRHE itself
arranged for the supply of cement from other local companies.
2/ EP included in its bid a communication offering 15% discount in case
it was awarded the contract.

3.5 Costs and Disbursements
3.5.1     A detailed breakdown of estimated and actual costs is shown in
Annex 2b. A summary of original and actual costs (in constant 1970 prices
for base costs), is indicated in Table III-1, based on price deflator indexes
shown in Annex 2c.
3.5.2     In current prices, the total cost overrun is estimated at US$51.4
million or 88%. In constant 1970 prices, the cost overrun for total costs
(appraisal vs. final) is US$19.5 million or 36%. Comparing the revised cost
estimate to the final cost (both in constant 1970 prices), the cost overrun
is US$7.1 million or 11%. The main factors for deviation were:
At Bayano
(i) an underestimation by 20% of the base cost forecasted at appraisal
as compared with the revised base costs;
(ii) higher-than-expected final engineering and administration costs
due to change of consulting firm, additional site-studies, revision
of designs and participation of the consulting engineers for a
longer-than-expected period (Annex 2b);
(iii)  increase in the dam foundation volume and grouting- changes
in the dam and power house location; change to more distant
quarries to obtain aggregates for concrete
(iv) errors in the manufacture and installation of penstocks by
the local contractor.

A cost revision made early in 1971 by MONENCO showed an increase of about
20% in the base cost of Bayano (in constant 1970 prices). The originally
estimated 6% physical and 7% price contingencies proved insufficient. The
actual expenditure increase due to physical contingencies is estimated at
about US$23 million or 44% of appraisal base cost while the original estimate
provided only US$3.3 million or 6%. Considering that the original base cost
estimate was too low by about 20%, the actual physical contingency would be
21% which is consistent with the actual changes in design and geological and
other problems encountered during construction. The actual expenditure due to
inflation is estimated at about US$36 million instead of the US$3.7 million
included in the appraisal estimate and was due to the very high world-wide
inflation during the project construction period (1970-1977).
3.5.4     Cost overruns were financed by the Government and IRHE, and by
suppliers' credits, as shown below:

3.6 Disbursements
3.6.1     About 80% and 89% of the loan had been disbursed by mid-1975 and
April 1976, the original project completion date and loan closing date,
respectively. In order to allow IRHE to disburse the total amount of the



- 21 -
loan, the Bank agreed to extend the loan closing date by 14 months from
April 30, 1976 to June 30, 1977. A summary of the forecast and actual cumula-
tive disbursements is shown in Annex 3a.
3.6.2.    Total actual and forecasted disbursements under each of the loan
categories are shown in Annex 3b.
3.7 Operations
3.7.1     A severe drought affected the Bayano basin area in 1976-77 which
delayed the filling of the reservoir by about eight months. The situation
improved by the end of 1977 and the plant is now operating normally.
3.8 Performance of Consultants, Contractors and the Borrower
3.8.1     IRHE has expressed its satisfaction with the consulting services
provided by MONENCO, ELECTROCONSULT, and C.T. Main (USA). C.T. Main prepared
and updated the Master Plan for Electrification. According to IRHE, the
assistance provided by S&W in the management and financial areas was
executed with very limited transference of experience and technology to
IRHE. Also, S&W's reservations to the concept of full fixed asset
revaluation delayed action by IRHE on critical financial matters. The
feasibility study made by EPTISA for Bayano was incomplete and the designs
of the dam and power house were not appropriate for the site conditions.
The size of the units recommended by EPTISA was not considered large
enough and was increased from 50 to 75 MW by the appraisal mission. Also,
the quarries identified by EPTISA which would provide the aggregate for
concrete proved unsuitable. Finally, the cost estimates prepared by
EPTISA at appraisal were underestimated by more than 20% (para. 3.5.3).
3.8.2      IRHE was dissatisfied with the performance of EP, the main
civil works contractor, during the first years of construction. During that
period, EP did not appoint highly qualified top staff to manage its opera-
tion in Bayano and often was unwilling to provide the full local and ex-
patriate labor force required in the opinion of MONENCO. But during the
last two years of the construction period, EP appointed an experienced
construction manager and increased the labor force to the levels recom-
mended by MONENCO. According to IRHE, other factors contributing to
difficulties with EP were:
(i) the initial contract price was very low;
(ii) the construction schedule was optimistic;
(iii)  the firm did not always substantiate its claims in a
fashion leading to their speedy negotiation;
(iv) the firm experienced shortages of working capital which
adversely affected its procurement activities in Panama; and
(v) the top personnel showed lack of flexibility in coming
to agreements with IRHE and the consulting engineers.



- 22 -
The EP construction period of 59 months canot be considered excessively long
for this type of project even though it exceeded the contract period by 19
months.
3.8.3.    IRHE's performance evidenced its lack of experience to deal simul-
taneously with several large contracts of long duration which involved complex
procurement under various financing procedures. During the first years of the
project, IRHE frequently adopted a rigid and inflexible position. This
situation improved substantially during 1974 and onwards as training and
experience of IRHE's top staff increased. The better communication established
through several changes in top construction management staff of IRHE, EP, and
MONENCO showed positive results by mid-1975 when IRHE and MONENCO designed,
and EP embarked on, an accelerated construction program for Bayano. As a part
of this program IRHE undertook and successfully carried out various parts of
the works. Later on, IRHE instituted the "Bayano Claims Commission", an
executive entity charged with solving the claims presented by the suppliers
and contractors. Eventually, the work of the Commission proved to be very
effective.
IV. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
4.1 Comparability of Actual and Forecasted Performance
4.1.1     The annual data for actual and forecasted income statements, funds
statements, and balance sheets are shown in Annexes 4, 5, and 6. The ratios
of financial performance for 1970-1977 (Table IV-1) and comparisons of summary
actual and forecasted statements of income and funds for 1970-1971, 1972-1976,
and 1970-1976 (Tables IV-2 and IV-3 respectively) show that:
(i)  actual and forecasted sales, revenue and expense, and expenditure
and funding are not comparable after 1971 because of IRHE's
acquisition of FyL in 1972 and other regional power companies
in 1973; and
(ii)  IRHE's financial performance was unsatisfactory in 1974-1976,
due to inadequate tariffs, slow Government payments for accounts
receivables and contributions, and liquidity problems related to
the financing of cost overruns on the Second and Third Power
Projects (para. 4.1.2.).
4.1.2     In 1970-1971, compared to the appraisal forecast, IRHE's financial
performance was satisfactory as measured by its return on net average assets
in operation (Table IV-1) and positive net internal cash generation (Table
IV-3). Since 1972, following the initiation of major civil-works construction
at Bayano and the acquisition of FyL, IRHE experienced declining rates of
return and negative net internal cash generation (B/16.4 million) for the
period 1972-1976, with financial problems being especially acute after 1974.
The following factors contributed to IRHE's difficulties:

- 26 -
(i) The Financing of Cost Overruns: The Second Power Project, espe-
cially the Bayano hydroplant, and the Third Power Project, expected
to be completed in 1978, suffered large cost overruns. To finance
these requirements, IRHE, lacking sources of funding more appropriate
to its needs, resorted to medium- and short-term commercial finan-
cing, which resulted in a lack of liquidity and an overburdened
debt-servic,, schedule over the medium term.
(ii) The Absence of Tariff Increases: The Government allowed IRHE
to pass on to consumers increases in imported fuel (an increase
of about 75% in electricity bills between 1973 and 1976), but
it did not authorize a tariff increase allowing IRHE to recover
its increases in costs other than fuel. As a result, the
rate of return on unrevalued assets decreased from 11.7%
in 1973 to only 3.9% in 1976 (2.8% on revalued assets in 1976).
(iii)  Government Equity Contributions:   In 1972-1976, the Government
contributions of B 50.5 million to IRHE's capitalization were
not sufficient to offset the impact of cost overruns and inade-
quate tariff levels. In addition, the Government was slow in
paying both its committed equity contributions and its
electricity bills.
(iv) Billing and Collections: IRHE had problems in its billings and
collection procedures in detriment to its liquidity.
4.2 Current and Expected Financial Performance
4.2.1     On the basis of preliminary financial data for 1977 (Annexes 4,
5, and 6), the tariff increase agreed to in connection with Loan 1470-PAN
appears to have improved substantially IRHE's financial performance. In
addition to rate-of-return and long-term debt-limitation covenants, the Loan
Agreement for Loan 1470-PAN includes covenants calling for annual revaluations
of operating assets and Bank consent to increases, beyond agreed limits, of
short-term debt and expenditures for new projects. These covenants, together
with consultancy services funded by Loan 1470-PAN for implementing organiza-
tional improvements and for tariff studies (incorporating the principle of
marginal cost of supply), are expected to support IRHE's future financial
performance.
4.3 Project Justification
4.3.1     The appraisal report does not contain an assessment of the internal
rate of return on the project. It does, however, show a comparison between the
Bayano hydro project and an equivalent thermal alternative. The comparison
was made by discounting the cost streams over a period of 60 years. This
analysis showed that the hydro development would be more economic than an all-
thermal program for discount rates of less than 16%. On the basis of comparing



- 27 -
actual investment and operating data for Bayano (in constant 1977 prices)
against estimated current investment and operating costs for a steam plant of
comparable size, Bayano was shown to be more economic that the thermal alterna-
tive for discount rates of less than 24% (see Annex 7).
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.1 IRHE's Role
5.1.1     In 1972 IRHE's role changed significantly when the Government
purchased all the assets of FyL. Due to the takeover of the activities of
FyL, IRHE experienced a growth which could not be foreseen at the time of the
appraisal in 1969. IRHE was not prepared to absorb the burden of the increased
operations.
5.2  IRHE's Organization
5.2.1     In 1973-74 during the appraisal and negotiations of the loan for the
Third Power Project, IRHE and the Bank agreed on the necessity of improving
IRHE's organization and establishing a comprehensive training program for
IRHE's personnel. As a result of this understanding, IRHE created the position
of Technical Director and, as a condition for effectiveness of the loan,
prepared, with S&W assistance, a training program for its personnel. A large
part of the program consisted of training courses for IRHE's key personnel.
The program was initiated as expected but because of policy discontinuity due
to considerable personnel turnover in certain key areas -- the Director General
was replaced in 1974 and there were three Financial Directors in the period
1974-1976 -- IRHE suspended the program. However, there was training for
personnel on the basis of immediate requirements.
5.2.2     During 1975 and 1976 IRHE carried out several organizational changes
based on studies prepared by IRHE's own staff. The Bank's position regarding
these changes was that there was still room for further organizational
improvements and it recommended that IRHE should continue improving its organi-
zation with the assistance of experienced consultants. After extensive
discussion in connection with the Fourth Power (Fortuna) Project, IRHE hired
S&W to carry out a Diagnostic Study of its organization. The study helped
IRHE to identify the organizational improvements and training required.
In February 1978, IRHE hired Gilbert & Associates (USA) under Bank financing
to implement the recommendations of the diagnostic study.
5.3 Other Factors Influencing IRHE's Performance
5.3.1     Also affecting adversely the institutional performance of IRHE was
increased Government intervention in the power sector arising, to a large
extent, from the public's sensitivity to sharply rising fuel costs. As a
result, IRHE was not always able to use its staff expertise to address its
problems, which resulted in delays to act promptly on matters such as tariff



- 28 -
increases and organizational problems. The Government has provided the Bank
with a satisfactory statement confirming IRHE's autonomy and commitment to
sound management policies.
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.1 Overall Performance and Working Relationship
6.1.1     The Bank's role was particularly difficult during the preparation
and implementation of this project and was characterized by a marked orientation
towards the institution-building aspects, such as sector legislation, IRHE's
organization and management and IRHE's technical and financial soundness.
In the course of extensive supervision of the project, the Bank's pursuance of
these objectives in the framework of IRHE's larger-than-expected activities,
simultaneously with the execution of a project with many technical problems,
led to difficult relations between IRHE and the Bank.
6.1.2     The areas where the Bank's performance was less satisfactory are:
(i) Project preparation and implementation. The Bank realized at
appraisal the shortcomings of EPTISA but decided to continue
appraising the project. The mission considerably increased
the estimate of project costs and accepted a construction
schedule involving an underestimation of about six months
of the time required for bid-document preparation, bidding,
bid evaluation, contract negotiations, and construction
start-up (para. 3.1.1).
(ii) Strategy for safeguarding sector finances. Throughout the
process of project preparation and appraisal, the Bank was
concerned with the problem of ensuring sound sector finances;
and during negotiations, in seeking this objective, the Bank
conditioned effectiveness of the Loan Agreement to the Govern-
ment's amending the Electricity Law -- the effective date of
Article 95 was changed from October 21, 1958 to January 1, 1969
(para. 2.2.2). This amendment was perceived as providing
special consideration for a profitable foreign corporation.
While Government accepted this amendment, it never promised
to forego all action seeking recovery of FyL's past excess
profits from electricity sales. Later, under Article 85
of the Electricity Law, the Government mandated substantial
tariff reduction on the grounds that past excess profits
were a legitimate rate base exclusion. Events showed that
the Bank had misjudged Panamanian determination to obtain
recovery; and apparently, the Bank had simply overlooked
Article 85 during negotiation. Claiming its finances were
deteriorating, FyL suspended its expansion program and pay-
ments to oil suppliers. In 1972, the Government nationa-
lized FyL, fearing Panama City and Colon were in iminent
danger of blackout. The Bank refused to intercede on
behalf of FyL, finding no violation of Government



- 29 -
commitments to the Bank. Since it was obvious at appraisal (and
before) that opinion in Panama was strongly against FyL, instead of
attempting to foreclose all Government action seeking recovery, the
Bank would have better pursued its objective, sound sector finances,
by persuading Government to extend the timing of its recovery efforts
over a period of several years.
(iii)  Flexibility to the borrower's needs and circumstances.   When IRHE
asked for an advance payment of US$1 million from the Bank to
solve EP's financial problems, the Bank adopted the position that
it would provide the advance payment only if IRHE and the Govern-
ment agreed to solve all major financial problems of IRHE (claims
settled, Government bills paid, and tariffs increased). Given the
Government's and IRHE's non-compliance with the rate-of-return and
tariff-increase covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
(Annex 1), it was reasonable for the Bank to ask IRHE to take
measures alleviating its tight liquidity position. The Bank
should have informed the Panamanians that the advance payment was
no solution to the financial problems of EP. But by conditioning
approval of a US$1 million advance to measures involving about
US$10 million in net additional sources of internal cash generation
(about US$12 million in additional net operating revenues from
tariff increases, plus about US$3 million in payments of overdue
receivables less about US$5 million in claims settlements), the
Bank asked IRHE to take measures making the advance unnecessary.
6.1.3.    During project implementation, the Bank's performance was good in
a number of institution-building areas, although most of the improvements were
achieved in connection with loans subsequent to Loan 661-PAN:
(i) Legislation. Convincing the Government and the borrower of the
advantages of improving sector legislation;
(ii)  Finances.  Convincing the Government and the borrower to adopt
measures to consolidate IRHE's financial position;
(iii) Organization. Alerting and motivating the borrower to
investigate organizational improvements and training needs;
(iv)  Expansion program.  Orienting the borrower's expansion program
towards the least-cost alternatives.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANT LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1 Technical Preparation and Execution
7.1.1     Good project preparation by a competent consulting firm is essen-
tial.



- 30 -
7.1.2     The feasibility study, relevant design and bidding documents
should be ready prior to loan approval.
7.1.3     In the case of large civil works contracts, prequalification of
bidders is desirable and the Bank would have been well advised to request it.
7.1.4     A careful review should be made of the references and curriculum-
vitae of the key personnel appointed by the supplier or contractor and is
essential for the successful completion of the project.

Annex 1
Major Covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements for Loan 661-PAN
1.        The Loan Agreement included debt-limitation and rate-of-return
covenants. The debt-limitation covenant (Section 5.09) provided for Bank
agreement for additional long-term borrowing if net revenues failed to cover
debt service by a ratio of at least 1.4 times. The rate-of-return covenant
(Section 5.10) called for a return of 8-3/4%, beginning in 1972. Under the
Guarantee Agreement, the Government promised prompt tariff action to permit
IRHE to earn its covenanted rate of return (Section 3.06), and also promised
fair regulation for all public and private sector entities (Section 3.08).
The object of this last covenant, like that amending Article 95 of the
Electricity Law (para. 2.2.2), was to ensure the financial viability of
IRHE's principal customer, FyL.
2.        In 1974, IRHE and the Government did not comply with the rate-of-
return and tariff-increase covenants. However, the Bank, in 1975 and 1976,
agreed to waive the rate-of-return covenant on an ex-post basis for the
period 1974-1976. The Bank repeatedly advised IRHE of the need to raise
tariffs -- which finally materialized in 1977 (para. 4.2.1).
3.        In 1976, IRHE did not comply with its debt-limitation covenant.
On December 29, 1975, IRHE sought Bank agreement for a borrowing commitment
(US$67.6 million for financing the La Estrella-Los Valles project) signed
on December 21. The loan contract only became effective after publication
in the "Gazeta Oficial". The Bank conditioned its acceptance to the
fulfillment of certain points, which had not been met by IRHE and the
Government when the Government ratified the contracts in February 1976.
These points were subsequently met and the Government and IRHE gave assur-
ances that, in future, covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements would
be strictly observed.
4.        Through Sections 7.01 and 3.08 of, respectively, the Loan and
Guarantee Agreements, the Bank sought to safeguard sector finances by prevent-
ing retroactive application of Article 95 of the Electricity Law to the past
excess profits of FyL (para. 2.2.2) and by requiring prompt Government action
to grant tariff increases, under the Electricity Law, for all public and
private electricity entities. At appraisal, the Bank obtained satisfactory
changes in sector legislation. In the sequence of events leading to the
nationalization of FyL, the Bank found no violation of commitments by Government
to the Bank (para. 6.1.2 (ii)).

1/ The appraisal wholesale - retail format for forecasted sales and revenues has been changed to the geographical format used
currently by IREE to facilitate annual comparisons of actual data. Almost all sales in the categories of "Rural", "Metropolitan
Panama City" (after July 1972) and "Other Systems" are retail sales.
2/ Bulk sales to Metropolitan Panama City amounted 240.8 million KWh in 1972; retail sales amounted to 300.5 million KWh after
July 1972. Bulk sales generated B 3.557 million in revenues; retail sales generated B 8.966 million in revenues.
3/ A contract dated May 9, 1969 obligated IRHE to supply PANCANAL with 30 MW and 210 million KWh annually. Because of severe
capacity restraints related to IRHE's acquiring FyL and other regional power companies, IRHE and PANCANAL mutually agreed
to suspend the contract from September 1, 1972 to December 31, 1976.
4/ Sales for the Cbiriqui and Santiago systems for the fourth calendar quarter of 1973; and for Chiriqui system only thereafter.

1/  In 1972, IRHE acquired the assets of Cia, Panamena de Fuerza y Luz (CPFL). There is no 1971 balance sheet, retroactively
adjusted for the acquisition of CPFL.
2/  The actual net change in working capital appearing in the funds statements for the years 1972-1974 does not coincide with
actual balance sheet data at year-end because of the acquisition and spin-off of telephone and gas properties acquired
from FyL for which there were no retroactive balance sheet adjustments.
