PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Korea Jeonju
Regional Development Project, for which Loan 2388-KO in the amount of US$60.0
million was approved on March 13, 1984. The last disbursement was made on
December 5, 1989 and the loan closed as originally scheduled on June 30, 1990.
A total of US$21.4 million was canceled from the loan amount.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of
the Asia Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). The
Borrower's Ministry of Construction, the main implementing agency, prepared a
detailed evaluation report, the summary and conclusions of which have been
incorporated as Part II of this PCR.
Preparation of the PCR was started during the Bank's last project
supervision mission in June 1990, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement, supervision mission reports,
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, the Bank's internal
memoranda and the Borrower's project evaluation ,eport.

KOREA
JEONJU REGIONALDEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 2388-KOl
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
i.          Objectives. The project's objectives were to: (a) support government
efforts to reduce inter-regional disparities by promoting economic development
and creating employment opportunities in Jeonju Region, one of Korea's poorest
areas; (b) address intra-regional disparities by promoting economic development
in the region's poorer mountain areas and islands; and (c) improve infrastructure
and living conditions in the region's two major cities, Iri and Jeonju. The
project was designed to exploit the region's comparative advantages: its low-
cost land and labor and its scenic areas. As an agricultural area, Jeonju Region
had been left behind in the country's shift to manufacturing.  However, high land
prices and controls on development in Seoul, where previous development had been
concentrated, were pushing expanding industries to seek locations in lower-cost
areas like Jeonju.   Tourism development under the project was based on the
assumption that the increase in disposable income nationwide would translate into
increased expenditures on recreation and domestic tourism.
ii.         The project financed various components of the region's overall
development plan: (a) for urban develoDment, construction in Iri City of a 46-ha
industrial estate and 20-ha housiLlg estate, drainage improvements, and loans
through the National Housing Fund for low-income housing estate beneficiaries;
and construction in Jeonju City of a 66-ha industrial estate and expansion of the
water distribution system; (b) for tourism development, construction of two
roads, the Namweon Tourism Estate and an access road to facilitate tourism in
Mt. Jiri National Park, construction of an access road to Mr. Naejang National
Park, and construction of foot bridges linking Seonju Island with two neighboring
islands and extension of landing jetties on the three islands. Transportation
investments comprised construction of the 350-m Woonain Bridge, upgrading of a 32-
km section of a national road, and construction of an access road to the Iri
industrial estate.   Technical assistance was also provided for a study and
training to prepare for future regional development projects. Subsequently, two
components were dropped from the project: the Iri housing estate, due to an
unexpected oversupply of housing in the area, and the technical assistance
component since a special fund for further projects diV not materialize.
Substituted in their place was the construction of two road sections linked to
the bridge and the Iri industrial estate.
iii.        Implementation Exi rience. Most of the project was completed within
the original five-year period (1984-88). The two components added to the project
during implementation were completed in 1989 as were two technically complex
components: the Woonam Bridge, one of the first major structures to use the pre-
stressed, cantilevered box girder technique in Korea, and the national road
section, which was realigned and a 800-m tunnel constructed. The project cost,



- iii -
at US$112 million (W 92 billion), was lower than the US$143 million (W 115
billion) estimated at appraisal due to lower than projected inflation rates,
devaluation of the won during the project period, and lower than expected civil
works contract prices due to keen competition among local contractors following
a downturn in the Middle Eastern construction market.
iv.         gesults. The project was generally successful in promoting economic
development and creating employment opportunities in Jeonju Region and in
improving living conditions in Iri and Jeonju Cities. The industrial estates
developed under the project were fully sold,  and the rate of growth of
manufacturing in the region was close to thle national average of 12% a year in
real terms during the decade (Part I, para. 6.03).  While the region's share in
national manufacturing output and employment did not increase, remaining at
around 2.5% during the 1980s, it will be several years before all factories in
the project's industrial estates are constructed and operating and the full
developmental effects of the estates are known.
v.          The tourism component had mixed results, at least in the medium term.
While construction of roads in the Mt. Jiri area resulted in more than a doubling
of the number of tourists visiting the area and an increase in tourism-derived
income of about W 4 billion in 1988 and W 5.7 billion in 1989, the expected
increase in tourist-related investments did not occur. Only 31% of the Namweon
Tourism Estate was sold three years after construction. This was largely due to
the high sale cost of the land (W 71,000/sq m compared to W 14,000 to W 24,000
for the industrial estates) since only 39% of the developed area was available
for sale (compared to 79% for the industrial estates) owing to the inclusion of
green space and facilities in tourism estates. In the Mt. Naejang area, tourist
traffic did not increase appreciably (income grew by only W 560 million in 1988
and W 321 million in 1989) since tourism there is largely confined to the autumn
and is constrained by a lack of associated facilities such as parking areas. In
the long term, however, continuing increases in vehicle ownership in Korea,
annual income, and the proportion of household income devoted to recreation may
result in substantial benefiLs from the project's tourism investments (Part 1,
para. 6.05).
vi.         The project's actual weighted average economic rate of return (ERR)
is 10% as opposed to 16% at appraisal.   The two estimates are not entirely
comparable, however, since ERRs could not be re-estimated for all project
components  (Part III,  Table 6-A).   Furthermore,  the recalculated ERR is
considered conservative due to the methodology employed (Part I, para. 6.06).
Under the water supply component, the Jeonju Water Bureau was required to
maintain an annual return of at least 6% on net fixed assets; however,
Government's concern over inflation and consequent reluctance to approve needed
water tariff increases nationwide caused the Bureau to achieve a return of only
1.2% in 1988 and to experience an operating loss in 1989.
vii.        Sustainabilitv. The project benefits are expected to be sustainable
and to increase with time.  A second phase of developing the Iri industrial
estate has begun; project drainage works at Iri have allowed the city to expand
to the south; and the increase in tourism promoted by the project should
eventually result in construction of additional tourism facilities in the Mt.



- iv -
Jiri area. Furthermore, a Second Jeonju Regional nevelopment Project has begun
as a follow up to the project, using local funds.
viii.       Etn_dings and Le_ssnLear_ened. The project provides several lessons
for the design of future Bank-assisted regional development projects.  First,
regional or area-based development projects need to be placed within the context
of a country's overall spatial development strategy and the spatial impact of its
other economic policies. In this project, the National Physical Land Development
Plan provided an overall framework for coordinating major infrastructure
investments in Korea, while the Government's policy of restricting development
of Seoul most likely accelerated the diffusion of manufacturing activities to
secondary cities like Iri and Jeonju.  Second. it is unrealistic to expect a
single project to reverse overall spatial development trends. The single Jeonju
project could not have been expected to increase the region's share of national
manufacturing output, but it probably did prevent existing inter-regional
disparities from worsening.   Project investments in industrial estates, for
example, attracted industries to locate in Iri and Jeonju rather than outside of
the region. Third, the project exemplifies the difficulty of designing projects
with an area focus. In order to have a meaningful impact, the project needed to
address the comprehensive investment needs of the region. But, with no single
agency responsible for carrying out regional investments, many institutions had
to be involved in implementation, making implementation arrangements complex.

PART T: BANK REVIEW OF_ THE PROJECT
Project Name:    Jeonju Regional Development Project
Loan Number:     2388-KO
RVP Unit:        Asia
Country:         Republic of Korea
Sector:          Urban
2. Background
2.01        During the 1970s, the Korean Goverrment became increasingly concerned
about the concentration of economic activity and population ihL the capital.
Seoul, and initiated a series of regional-development projects under the Ministry
of Construction (MOC) to encourage a more even distribution of economic growth
and population throughout the country.   The Gc.ernment's approach was to
construct highways, major water systems, industrial complexes and other
infrastructure to promote economic development in strategic areas. MOC's ten-
year National Physical Land Development Plans provided the overall framework for
guiding major infrastructure  investments nationwide.   Following the First
National Physical Land Development Plan (1972-81), regional development plans
were prepared for the three poorest regions, Gwangju and Jeonju in the southwest
and Taeback in the northeast, during the 1970s and early 1980s.
2.02        The Bank supported the Government's regional development efforts
through a series of projects, first in Gwangju Region and subsequently in Jeonju
Region. The Bank provided a loan of US$15 million in 1975 for the Secondary
Cities Regional Development Project (Loan 1070-KO) in Gwangju and followed it up
with a larger loan of US$65 million in 1979 for the Second Gwangju Regional
Project (Loan 1758-KO).   The Bank's first two regional projects aimed at
addressing inter-regional income inequities by promoting economic development and
improving living conditions through a series of investments in economic and
social infrastructure made by HOC and the local governments. The first project
was completed in 1980 and the second in 1985. The Jeonju Region was identified
as a potential candidate for the Bank's third regional project in 1978.
3. Prolect Ob_ectives and,Deseri_tion
3.01        The objectives of the Jeonju Regional Project were to: (a) support
the Government's efforts to reduce inter-regional disparities by promoting
economic development and creating employment opportunities in Jeonju Region; (b)
address intraregional disparities by promoting economic development in the poorer
mountain areas and islands within the region; and (c) improve infrastructure and
living conditions in two major cities of the region, Iri and Jeonju.



-2-
3.02        The project consisted of the following components:
(a)   Urban -DavelDment:  (i) Irn  City - Construction of an industrial
estate (46 ha) and housing estate (20 ha), including loans through
the National Housing Fund for low-income beneficiaries, and
impravement of drainage through the construction a drainage network
and retaining basin and installation of lift pumps. (ii) Jenlucity
- Construction of an industrial est.ate (66 ha) and expansion of the
water distribution system through construction of a service
reservoir (7,000 cu m) and about 21 km of distribution pipelines.
(b)   Tourism DeveloRment: (i) mt. Jiri National-Park - Construction of
mountain roads from Yugmojeong to Deogdong (about 19 km) anI from
Banseon to Cheonunsa (about 25 km) to improve access to scenic
areas, development of a tourism estate and construction of an access
road  in  Namweon  City.    (ii)  Mt._ Naejang  National  Park  -
Rehabilitation and construction of tourist access road between
Naejangea and Baegyangsa (about 16 km).   (iii, Seonyu Island -
Construction of two foot bridges linking Seonyu Island with the
neighboring two islands in the Seonyu Island group and extension of
the existing landing jetties on the three islands.
(c)  T,ransgortation DeveloRment:  (i) Construction of a bridge (350 m x
10 m) and 3 km of approach road at Woonam. (ii) Upgrading of about
32 km of National Road No. 19 between Namweon and Gurye.   (iii)
Construction of about 11 km of road to link the proposed Iri
Industrial Estate with National Road No. 26 to the port in Gunsan
City.
(d)   Technical Assistance:   Preparation study and training for future
regional and urban development projects.
3.03        Two changes were made to the project scope during implementation.
First, the project preparation study under the technical assistance component was
deleted and two additional road sections, pavement of National Road 27 from
Woonam to Galtam (about 10 km) and widening of about 13 km of road between the
Iri Industrial Estate and the Honam Expressway, were added to the project in
1986.  The remaining technical assistance funds were canceled when it became
clear that an Urban Development Fund, which was to provide the basis for further
urban/regional projects in Korea, would not materialize due to jurisdictional
conflicts within the Government.  The additional road sections were directly
linked to the Woonam Bridge and Iri Industrial Estate components.
3.04        Second, the housing estate component was dropped in 1987 due to an
estimated oversupply of housing resulting from completion of another major
housing estate in Iri City. The Government constructed the latter estate, which
comprised high-rise apartments built to a standard desi3n (the approach typically
taken in government hou3ing programs). Given Korea's cold climate and high land
prices, the Government had questioned the appropriateness of the project's sites
and services approach, which the Bank had been promoting in other coun;ries as
a way of supplying affordable housing for low-income groups. Eventually, the



-3-
Bank supported the government approach by helping to finance its housing projects
in Korea.
4. Proloet Design_and_Organization
4.01        The project was designed to exploit the comparative advantages of the
region: its low cost of land and labor and its scenic areas. As an agricultural
area, Jeonju Region had been left behind in the country's shift toward
manufacturing. However, high land prices and controls on development in Seoul
were pushing expanding industries to seek locations in lower-cost areas like the
Jeonju Region. The project's tourism component was included because increases
in disposable income nationwide were expected to result in increased expenditures
for recreation and domestic tourism. It was therefore decided to promote the
region's scenic but underdeveloped mountain areas and islands for domestic
tourism by improving access and providing accommodations and facilities.
4.02        Individual investments included in the project were coordinated under
the Government's National Physical Land Development Plan (para. 2.01) and city
land use plans.   Specific project components were selected on the basis of
feasibility studies of various investment proposals submitted by the cities and
counties and coordinated by the provincial government. Some project investments
were included in or complemented projects in the First National Physical Land
Development Plan, e.g., the project's two industrial estates along with a coastal
industrial estate and expanded port facilities in Gunsan (already being
constructed at the time of project identification) were part of the Government's
strategy to develop an industrial base in the Jeonju Region, while the Jeonju
City water distribution component complemented a Geum River Basin Water Supply
Project funded by the Asian Development Bank.
4.03        Under Korea's Urban Planning Law, all cities were required to prepare
land-use plans which included rights of way for future infrastructure
investments. All of the cities, investment proposals were included in their
respective city plans.   Zoning was strictly enforced in Korea.  Under these
circumstances, infrastructure investment became an effective tool in guiding
urban development, especially if the Government could maintain the supply of
industrial land, housing, roads and other facilities to meet the needs of the
growing economy and urban population.
4.04        The project organization was complex,  involving three national
government agencies--MOC, the Korea Land Development Corporation (KLDC), and the
Korea National Tourism Corporation (KNTC)--and at least four local governments,
Jeonbug Province, Jeonju City, Iri City and Namweon City. MOC provided overall
coordination and was responsible for constructing all project components other
than the industrial estates, which was implemented by KLDC, and the tourism
estate, implemented by KNTC. Jeonju, Iri and Namweon Cities provided part of the
counterpart funding, assumed part of the Bank loan, and at completion took over
the industrial estates, the water supply and tourism estate components.12 The
21    The Iri housing estate, which was subsequently canceled,  was to be
constructed by KLDC and turned over to the city.



4-
provincial government acted as a coordinator for the local governments.   In
addition to their expertise in land and tourism development, KLDC and KNTC were
brought in to provide local counterpart funding needed to overcome financial
shortfalls in the project cities. It was recognized that this situation was not
ideal, and the technical assistance component included funds for a study of a
financial intermediary for financing local government investments in subsequent
projects.
4.05        'c e institutional complexity is inevitable in this type of area-
based multi-a  oral project, in which it is not possible to limit invc;vement
to just one ab. .y.  Coordination was facilitated, however, by involving the
participating local governments in project identification, preparation and
implementation and by clearly defining the role each agency had to play in the
project. Korea's highly centralized system of using career civil servants of the
Ministry of Home Affairs as senior local officials was also helpful. At the same
time, this institutional diversity made it difficult to focus on difficulties
faced by 'ndividual agencies participating in the project.
5. project Implementation
5.01        The start of the project was delayed by one year from its original
target of 1983 to 1984 because of budgetary cutbacks resulting from economic
recession and the Government's consequent decision to defer the start of new
projects. Most of the project was completed within the original five-year period
(1984-88). Two technically complex components were completed behind schedule in
1989, namely: (a) the Woonam Bridge, one of the first major structures to use the
prestressed,  cantilevered  box  girder  technique  in  Ko-'';  and  (b)  the
Namweon-Gurye Road, where it was decided to adjust the  -d alignment and                     I
construct a 800 m tunnel. Paving of the Woonam-Galtam Road and widening of tL.e
Iri Industrial Estate-Honam Expressway road (added to the project in 186, para.
3.03), were started in 1987 and completed in 1989.   The planned and actual
implementation schedules are presented in Part III, Tables 4-A and 4-B.
5.02        Procurement.  Procurement was handled efficiently.  Since no foreign
firms expressed interest in bidding on project works, procurement of civil works
was conducted using local competitive bidding procedures. Most of the contracts
were awarded during the first half of 1985. The downturn in the Middle Eastern
construction market at that time led to fierce competition among Korean
construction firms, resulting in actual bids that were significantly lower (about
25%) than estimates.
5.03        Prol-ect Costs.  Total project costs were lower than estimated at
appraisal both in U.S. dollar and in won terms: actual project costs were US$112
million and W 92 billion, compared to US$143 million and W 115 billion at
appraisal. A summary as well as a detailed comparison of estimated and actual
project costs are presented in Part III, Tables 5-A and 5-B. The decrease in
project costs resulted from: (a) lower than estimated contract costs (para.
5.02); and (b) lower than projected inflation rates. Inflation estimates turned
out to be about twice actual inflation (based on the GNP deflator), i.e.,
projectionis were 7.5% versus actual inflation of 3.9% in 1984, 7% versus 4.2% in
1985, 6% versus 2.8% in 1986, 6% versus 3.5% in 1987, and 6% versus 5.9% in 1988.
The reduction in costs from deletion of the Iri Housing Estate component, W iO.7



-5-
million including contingencies, was offset by the additional cost of the
Woonam-Caltam and Iri Industrial Estate-Honam Expressway road sections, W ll..6
million.
5.04        While actual construction costs were lower than estimated, land
prices were about 50% higher than appraisal estimates.  As under the Second
Gwangju Regional Project, the appraisal underestimated the increase in land
prices in Korea's rapidly urbanizing and developing economy.
5.05        Disbursements.  The loan was disbursed over five and a half years,
from September 1985 to December 1989. The last disbursement was made in December
1989, the loan closed on June 30, 1990, the original closing date, and the
balance canceled cin July 1, 1990. Altogether, US$21.4 million (or about 36% of
the loan) was canceled. The savings were due to the lower cost oZ civil works
and the devaluation of the won, which fell from W 800 to the U.S. dollar at
appraisal to W 881 to the dollar in 1986, after which it regained some of its
value. A schedule comparing estimated and actual disbursements by quarters is
presented in Part III, Table 3. Disbursements from the various categories of the
loan are also shown.
5.06        Project Risks.  At project appraisal, the following were considered
the main project risks: (a) possible delays in construction due to budgetary
shortfalls and (b) difficulties in marketing the industrial and tourism estates
due to lower demand than anticipated. Lack of counterpart funding was not an
issue during construction, and sales of the Iri and Jeonju Industrial Estates
were completed within two years of the end of construction. However, the Namweon
Tourism Estate experienced difficulties in sales; only 31% of the estate had sold
three years after the end of construction, despite repeated promotional efforts
by KNTC and Namweon City.
5.07        In retrospect, there may have been some fundamental problems in the
concept of a tourism estate. Both the industrial and the tourism estates were
developed based on the premise that investment in the infrastructure would induce
growth in the target industries, manufacturing and tourism.  This is a valid
assumption in Korea where strict land-use planning and zoning regulations limit
locational choice by private enterprises to areas zoned for that specific use.
However, unlike6 industrial development, a tourism estate involves many aesthetic
considerations and the developer is required to include green space and other
areas and facilities which cannot be sold off but which still factor into the
development costs. In the Iri and Jeonju Industrial Estates, 79% of the total
area was available for sale; in the Namweon Tourism Estate, only 39% of the
developed area was available for sale. As a result, the cost per square meter
of land available for sale was about W 71,000 for the Namweon Tourism Estate,
compared to W 14,000 for the Iri Industrial Estate and W 24,000 for the Jeonju
Industrial Estate. These differences in costs were reflected in the proposed
sales prices. In addition, the Namweon Tourism Estate specified the use of each
piece of land, i.e., for a hotel, inns, restaurants, shops; industrial land could
be sold to any manufacturing enterprise. While tourism estates may be useful in
inducing International investment, domestic entrepreneurs may have found the cost
too expensive.

6. Project Results
6.01        Project Obiectives.    The project was  generally  successful  in
promoting economic development and creating employment opportunities in Jeonju
Region and in improving living conditions in Iri and Jeonju Cities.   The
estimated impact of various facets of the project are discussed below. It is not
possible, however, to measure the project's overall impact on improving
inter-regional disparities since project components constituted only part of the
investment in the Jeonju Region and some of the project's impact, e.g., on
tourism development in the mountain areas, will become clear only over a longer
term. A detailed evaluation of the project was carried out for the Government
by Jeonbug University, a summary of which is presented in Part II of this report.
6.02        Physical Impact.   The physical targets of the project were met,
except  for  the  housing  estate  component  which  was  deleted.    Actual
accomplishments are listed in Part III, Table 6-A.
6.03        Economic Impact.   Project investments were in line with overall
development trends in the Korean economy. During the 1980s, Korea averaged real
economic growth of around 10% per annum, with the manufacturing sector as the key
engine of growth, increasing its share in Gross Domestic Product from 27% in 1980
to 34% in 1989. Manufacturing output growth averaged around 12% per annum in
real terms over the decade, while manufacturing employment g:ew by about 6% per
annum.   Concurrently, the concentration of manufacturing in Seoul began to
decline, as the city's manufacturing output and employment fell from 19% and 22%,
respectively, in 1980 to 13% and 17% in 1988. In the Jeonju Region, the rate of
manufacturing growth during the 1980s was close to the national average, but the
region did not benefit from the diffusion of manufacturing activities out of
Seoul, its share in national manufacturing output and employment remaining at
around 2.5%.  However, it will be several years before all factories in the
project's industrial estates are constructed and operating and the full
developmental effects of the estates are known. At this point, it is safe to say
that government development of industrial land was critical in influencing
industries' choice of location for setting up new operations, given the tight
zoning regulations in force in Korea.
6.04        The impact of the tourism component on development of the mountain
areas, the poorest in the region, is difficult to determine. In the case of Mt.
Jiri, the construction of roads has resulted in an increase in the number of
tourists from an average of 1.1 million a year during 1983-87 to 2.1 million in
1988 and 2.5 million in 1989. However, as indicated by the lack of interest in
the project's tourist estate component, this has not necessarily resulted in a
major increase in tourist-related investments. Furthermore, it is difficult to
determine to what extent tourists purchase locally-produced goods and services
(and thus to determine the level of benefits to the local economy) without a
detailed survey.   In the case of Mt. Naejang, the roads improved under the
project did not result in a dramatic increase in tourist traffic because tourism
in the area is more seasonal, the main attraction being the autumn leaves, and
because of the lack of associated facilities such as parking areas.



-7-
6.05        In the long term, however, continuing increases in vehicle ownership,
annual income, and the proportion of household income devoted to recreation may
result in substantial benefits from the project's tourism investments. Korea
experienced an explosion in the growth of motor vehicles during the 1980s, with
the number of cars, buses and trucks increasing from 0.5 million in 1980 to 2.7
million in 1989, an annual growth rate of 20%.  The largest increase was in
private passenger cars which increased by 26% during this period, accounting foi
more than half the vehicles owned in 1989. With economic growth, people were
able to spend more on recreational expenditures: urban households spent 43% of
their income on food and 9% on education, reading and recreational activities in
1980 but spent 32% on food and 12% on education, reading and recreational
activities in 1989.  Increased vehicle ownership and incomes increase mobility,
making the potential for tourism strong.
6.06        Economic Rates of Return (ERR) were estimated to determine the actual
impact of individual project components, using the methodology employed at
appraisal; details are presented in Part III, Table 6-A. As re-estimated, the
weighted average ElRR for the project is 10%, compared to 16% at appraisal.Li
The two calculations are not directly comparable, however, since the ERR was not
re-estimated for all project components.   Furthermore,  the revised ERR is
considered very conservative since: (a) sales prices for the industrial estates
were based on their cost rather than on their possible market prices; and (b)
benefits from the drainage component took into consideration estimated savings
in damage costs, following the methodology used at appraisal, but did not
consider the development potential of the land. Since the drainage improvements
were made on the fringe of Iri City, the project opened up the area for possible
residential and commercial development, and land values should have increased
significantly. This benefit could have been captured if imputed rental values
had been used as a measure of benefits.
6.07        Finangial Performance of the Jeoniu Water Bureau. Under the project,
the Jeonju Water Bureau was expected to maintain an annual return on net fixed
assets of not less than 6%.   However,  the Bureau's financial performance
deteriorated significantly after 1985, when it began to buy water from the Geum
River Regional System, which increased its operating costs significantly. The
increased costs, along with the Government's reluctance to approve needed water
tariff increases nationwide out of concern for inflation, caused the Bureau to
have a return of only 1.2% in 1988 and an operating loss in 1989 (for the income
statement, see Part III, Table 6-C). The tariff issue has also resulted in lack
of compliance with Bank Loan Agreement covenants for water supply in the Namgang
and Taegu Water Supply Project (Loan 2615-KO) and the Juam Regional Water Supply
Project (Loan 3178-KO).
t2    The ERR estimates of the Bank (Part I) and the Government evaluation (Part
II) differ due to: (a) differences in the measurement of benefits, with
the appraisal's methodology used in Part I and a different methodology
used in Part II; and (b) adjustments made to costs for the transportation
components, where the Bank used government estimates of vehicle operating
and time cost savings as benefits.



7. Project Sustainability
7.01        The project benefits are expected to be sustainable and increase with
time.   KLDC has embarked on development of an additional phase of the Iri
Industrial Estate; reduction of flooding is allowing Iri City to expand to the
south; and the increase in tourism facilitated by project investments should
eventually result in construction of more restaurants, hotel rooms, and other
tourism facilities in Namweon City. In addition, MOC is proceeding with a Second
Jeonju Regional Development Project as a follow-up to this project, using local
financing.
8. Bank Performance
8.01        The Bank performed satisfactory during all phases of the project.
A very good rapport had been established with MOC through the previous regional
projects in Gwangju. As the Jeonju operation was a repeater project, both the
borrower and the Bank were familiar with the project approach. During project
implementation, the Bank provided technical assistance to the Government by
bringing in an expert/consultant on prestressed concrete bridge construction to
review construction of the Woonam Bridge and provide advice to MOC.  At the
Government's request, the consultant gave several lectures on bridge construction
to local engineers during his visits to-Korea.
8.02        The project provides several lessons for the design of future Bank-
assisted  regional  development  projects.    First,  regional  or  area-based
development projects need to be placed within the context of a country's overall
spatial development strategy and the spatial impact of its other economic
policies. In this project, the National Physical Land Development Plan provided
an overall framework for coordinating major infrastructure investments in Korea,
while the Government's policy of restricting development of Seoul most likely
accelerated the diffusion of manufacturing activities to secondary cities like
Iri and Jeonju. Second, it is unrealistic to expect a single project to reverse
overall spatial development trends. The single Jeonju project could not have
been expected to increase the region's share of national manufacturing output,
but it probably did prevent existing inter-regional disparities from worsening.
Project investments in industrial estates, for example, attracted industries to
locate in Iri and Jeonju rather than outside of the region. Third, the project
exemplifies the difficulty of designing projects with an area focus. In order
to have a meaningful impact, the project needed to address the comprehensive
investment needs of the region.  But, with no single agency responsible for
carrying out regional investments, many institutions had to be involved in
implementation, making implementation arrangements complex.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01        MOC, KLDC, KNTC and the local governments performed excellently
during the project. MOC, KLDC and KNTC, the three main implementing agencies,
had previous experience with bank-funded projects and were familiar with the
Bank's procedures and requirements.  P-ogress reports and audit reports were
submitted in a timely manner.



-9-
10. Prolect_RelAtionships
10.01       Relationships between the many project agencies were very good.
11. Consulting Services
11.01       Consultants engaged for the project feasibility study, detailed
engineering and construction supervision performed satisfactorily. The bridge
specialist brought in by the Bank to assist with the Woonam Bridge proved
'articularly helpful (para. 8.01). The performance of local contractors was also
satisfactory.
12. PoUct ,Dgcumentation anda_ta
12.01       Project documentation was generally adequate.  Lack of proficiency
in English, especially at the working levels in the project agencies and local
governments, limited the effectiveness of Bank documents, unless translated into
Korean.

PART IIY BORROWEMR_RFIEW OF' THE PROJEC
At the request of the Korean Ministry of Construction, a very thorough evaluation
of the Jeonju Regional Development Project was carried out by the Institute of
Urban and Environmental Studies at Jeonbug National University. That report,
entitled The DeveloDMent    act Analss  and Evaluation of the 1st Stage of
le-oniu Reiodnal Prolect (August 1990), was prepared by a team of researchers led
by Myeng Su Jang, Professor of Regional and City Planning, assisted by Eung Kyo
Ryu, Professor of Architectural Planning and Urban Development.   While the
report's length precludes its inclusion here in its entirety, the final chapter,
which summarizes the findings of the evaluation, is provided below in an edited
version. The complete report is available on request.
Conclusions of the Government Evaluation
of the Jeonju Regional Development Pro1ect
1.          The Government's implementation of a regional development project in
Jeonbug Province was important for redressing an imbalance that existed in
development of the country's various regions.   The project undeniably had a
considerable impact on the province's social, economic, cultural and tourism
development, which, at the start of the project in 1984, lagged behirnd the levels
of other regions.  The Government's policy of providing direct assistance to
disadvantaged provinces under this project as well as the two Bank-assisted
projects for Gwangju region (Loans 1070 and 1758-K0) and the approach taken,
i.e., planning investments from a "macro" point of view, were necessary to
prevent increased socioeconomic imbalances among the regions.   Results of
evaluations of the project's components are summarized below.
Economic lmDact of r_oect Investments
2.          Industrial Estates. Development of industrial land in Jeonju and Iri
was found to have contributed greatly to the province's industrialization. The
regional multiplier impact of construction of the estates was fairly good at
1.2995. The impact of industrial estate development on regional income, i.e.,
income derived from sale of the developed industrial estates, is estimated at W
32,358 million for Jeonju and W 8,839 million for Iri, while the scale of
production inducement spread by industrial investment was W 530,270 million for
the Jeonju estate and W 13,425 million for the Iri estate.   In terms of
employment generation, the Jeonju estate helped create employment for 29,724
persons with estimated annual earnings of W 112,815 million while the Iri estate
created employment for 3,626 persons earning about W 13,765 million annually.
Partly as a result of the project, the performance of Jeonbug Province in terms
of gross product, value added, number of factories and employees, etc. improved
over the pre-project situation.
3.          Tourism Develooment.   Results of project investments for tourism
development were as follows:
(a)   The two roads constructed under the project to provide tourist
access to Mt. Jiri and the surrounding national park facilitated a
large increase in tourism in the area, and analysis of this



- 11 -
investment shows a benefit:cost ratio (B/C) of 1.25, which is
considered good. Income derived from tourism in the area increased
by W 3,916 million from 1987 to 1988 and by W 5,679 million from
1988 to 1989.
(b)   The laejan l-BaRegy_ansa Road had a B/C of 1.21 and increased
regional income by W 560 million from 1987 to 1988 and by W 321
million from 1988 to 1989.
(c)   Jetty construction under the Seon_u-Island. Develoment coMponent
resulted in an increase in islanders' incomes of about W 40 million
annually while benefits due to construction of a bridge between the
Island and two adjacent islands amounted to W 28 million. Partly as
a result of the project, regional income increased by W 12 million
in 1987, W 18 million in 1988 and W 30 million in 1989, indicating
major economic benefits.
4.           ragnsportatign. Road investments under the project had particularly
high economic returns and seem to indicate that construction of new roads,
expansion of existing roads and road pavinig have a greater impact on regional
development than do most other types of investment. Analysis of the project
investments using a discount rate of 13% indicates that: construction of the Iri
industrial estateaccess_ro_d_ had a B/CG-of 1.12, a net present value (NPV) of W
885 million, and an internal rate of return (IRR) of more than 14%; expansion of
the Ir  industrial estate - Ir  interchanze road had a B/C of 1.51, NPV of W
2,753 million and an IRR of about 19%; the Woonam Bri..ye-Galtem road had a B/C
of 1.36, NPV of W 3,605 million and an IRR of about 17%; and the Namweon-Gurve
o"ad had a B/C of 1.47, NPV of W 7,167 million and an IRR of about 20%.
5.          WerSuoYRv. Due to expansion of the Jeonju City water distribution
system under the project and benefits from the Geum River Project, the City's
water supply system provides the population served with about 300 liters of water
per capita per day (lcpd), or 10 lcpd above the project target. However, service
coverage at about 85% of the local population is below the 90% targeted due to
a greater than expected increase in the local population, expanded housing
development, increased fees, etc. Cost-benefit analysis indicates that the NPV
of the Bank loan for this investment (W 1,811,511,000) was W 1,142,108,000, to
be returned in 1998. The NPV for the total investment of W 2,089,159,000 amounts
to W 540,012,000.
6.          Diae    r                               .  Drainage  improvement was
carried out in Iri City to stop continual flooding of the area, which inflicted
tremendous property damage on local residents each year. As a result of these
improvements, the area is now free ftom flood damage, even with precipitation of
300 mm or more per day.   Project investment in flood control facilities is
expected to be recouped by the year 2006, or 16 years after the completion of
works. The NPV of the improvement work is estimated at W 1,623 million.
Environmental ImRact of the Proiect
7.          Despite a lack of baseline data indicating environmental conditions
in the project area prior to project implementation, an environmental impact



- 12 -
assessment was carried out of tourist roads provided under the project and of the
second Jeonju and Iri industrial  estates  (which  followed up  on projecjt
investments).   In considering the industrial estates,  for example,  it was
difficult to segregate effluent pollutants derived from the estates from those
related to other factors. An analysis was nevertheless attempted.
8.          Water pollution from effluents from the second Jeonju industrial
estate are not considered serious, and industrial waste produced by the estate
comprises only 0.06% of total waste produced by the estate area. At the second
Iri estate, air pollution from the estate is not a problem, although water
pollution is occurring and the BOD concentration rose from 10.6 mg/l to 12.2
mg/l.
9.          Pollution of the Mansoo, Wonchon and Seosi Rivers is expected to
increase due to construction of the project roads and the increased tourism they
permit. By the year 2001, pollution in the rivers is expected to cause their
water quality to be classed as Grade II and thus requiring remedial measures.
The change in vegetation due to construction of the Naejangsa-Baegyangsa road is
insignificant, and noise in the area is lower than the acceptable standard.
Issues and Recommendations
10.         The review of the project highlighted a number of issues and
conclusions, prompting the review team to make the following recommendations:
-     Benefits  of_ Industrial  Development.    Evaluation  of  project
investments supporting increased industrialization of the Jeonbug
area indicated the notable increase in regional income generated by
this investment and the related decrease in income inequity between
Jeonbug Province and the more developed provinces, In fact, demand
for industrial sites in the Province surpassed the supply developed
under the project.   Overall,  this indicates the value of such
investments for the region and the country in general and the need
to continue this investment.
Need for Sustained Government Commitment to Regional Development.
Completion of investments under the project should be followed up by
a second stage project in the same region, using domestic resources.
Key requirements for Jeonbug's further development are construction
of the Yongdam Dam and investment in social (human) capital as well
as the Government's continued commitment to the region's growth.
Need for Further Investment in the Mt. Jiri Area.  Continued growth
of tourism is this mountainous area is threatened by difficult
driving conditions on the Yugmojeong-Deogdon and Baiisean-Cheonunsa
roads constructed under the project, with their many steep slopes
and sharp curves, as well as increased air pollution due to
increased traffic. The risk of damage to the natural environment is
of  particular  concern.    Measures  to  minimize  pollution  and
environmental degradation are therefore recommended, along with
investment in parking lots and road turn-offs to ease vehicular
congestion.



- 13 -
Lack of Rejense to Namweon Tourist Site DeveloRment.  Very little
of the land developed for tourism purposes under the project w4s
sold.   It is consequently recommended that tourism development
should be incorporated into overall regional planning and not
carried out independently of other developments. Regarding Namweon,
the city authorities should identify ways to spur interest in their
tourist estate.
SeonMu Isgand Develogment. Construction of two foot bridges linking
Seonyu Island with two neighboring islands was expected to meet the
needs of local residents as well as facilitate tourism in the area.
While the bridges have helped students to reach schools, their
effect on tourism was more limited than expected, largely because of
the need to also expand public utilities like power and water supply
on the island. It is therefore proposed that a source of water be
secured for the island and that the island's reservoir and water
distribution network be expanded.
Need for Follow-un to Project Water_Su1Dlv Investment.  Expansion of
Jeonju City's service reservoir and distribution system under the
project was well advised but cannot meet long-term demand. A water
source to supply water for the entire city is now needed, along with
follow-up investment in drainage.
Introduction  of  Improved  Project  Implementation  Arrangements.
Increased  project  costs  (compared  to  contract  prices)  and
implementation delays under the project resulted from frequent
modifications  made  to  designs  during  implementation.        The
authorities therefore need to carry out better field surveys and
analysis in order to prepare detailed implementation plans prior to
the start of works.
Need for Imvroved Pata Collection. Analysis and assessment of the
project's impact was generally constrained by a lack of basic data
and inconsistent statistics.  To improve the regions' ability to
collect and interpret data and thereby to identify regional
development needs, the Government needs urgently to make the
required investments in social capital.

Comments
1. Industrial Estates !nputed rental values were taken as a measure of
benefits. Rents were assumed to be 10% of sales value. The benefits
are under-estimated since KLDC's policy is to sell land at cost,
including provision for financial and management costs, rather than
at market value. Active presales of the estate at Iri seems to
indicate that actual sales price is somewhat lower than what the
industrialist would have been willing to pay if the lots had been
auctioned.
2. Tourism DeveloDment The ERR was not reestimated since it was not
possible to obtain data on tourist expenditures.
3. Transportation  Vehicle operating costs savings and time savings were-
taken as benefits. Estimates were obtained from the Jeonbug
University Project Evaluation Study. Adjustments were made in the
project costs so the ERR is different from that quoted in Part II.

4.  CWI.P 2Cnent  Savings from damages were taken as benefits.
Before the project, the project area experienced annual flooding of
up to six times for 3 to 72 hours each. The project has eliminated
this flooding. The appraisal estimate for damage, W 1,321 million in
1983 prices, was used. The project benefits however are hard to
quantify. The damage from flooding is difficult to measure. It is
possible that not all the damage, especially to households gets
reported. In addition to physical damage, there are most likely
health benefits for the affected residents. The area is adjacent to
Iri City and could be developed for residential and commercial use
now that the flooding has been eliminated. If potential land use is
taken into consideration, the ERR of the project would have been
significantly higher.
