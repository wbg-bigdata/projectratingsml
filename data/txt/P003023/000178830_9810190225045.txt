REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE Pl;ESIDELT TC TH1E EXECUTIVL iUL;LCTORI'S
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TItL REPPlELIC OF ZAIREL
FOR A WATER SUPPLY PROUJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Zaire for the equivalent of US$21.5
million on standard IDA terms for a Water Supply Project. The proceeds of
the Credit would be relent to Regideso (tile National Water Supply Authority)
for 25 years including five years of grace at an interest rate of 8-1/2
percent per annum. The project would be cofinanced by the Arab Bank for
Economic Development in Africa (BADLA) in an amount of USE10 million, by th,e
African Development Bank (ADB) in an amount of 5 million units of account
(USS6.1 million equivalent), and by the UNDP in an amount of US$1.6 millionl.
The BADEA loan would be to the Government for 25 years, including five years
of grace at an interest rate of 4 percent per annum and would be relent to
Regideso on the same terms. The ADB loan would be to Regideso for 15 years
including four years of grace at 7 percent per annum. The UNDP contribution
to the project of US$1.6 million would be a grant.
PART I - THLE ECONOMIY
2.        A Basic Economic Mission visited Zaire in April-.lay 1974, and its
renort entitled "The Economy of Zaire" (rNo. 821-ZPR) was aistributeci to the
Executive Directors on August 8, 1975. Country data are attache(i as Annex I.
3.        Zaire, the third largest country in Africa, is rich in mineral, agri-
cultural, forestry and energy resources, but the country is among tthe poorest
in. terms of per capita income. The economy is vulnerable to changes in world
economic conditions, as demonstrated by the present crisis. The key constraints
to development are: (a) the shortage of skilled manpower and the overall weakness
of the institutions with direct development responsibilities; (b) the very poor
social conditions, particularly poor health and low nutrition in both the urban
and rural milieu; and (c) the deterioration of the agricultural sector and of
transport infrastructure.
4.        Few countries suffered as much disruption and cliaos as did Zaire in
the first 6-7 years of its independence. Political order and stability were
established in 1967 and only then could the Government take a number of econo-
mic measures. GDP grew by about 10 percent (in real terms) annually in the
subsequent years. In the same period government savings rose to US$110 million
in 1970, compared with a deficit in 1966, while capital expenditures increased
considerably. Zaire's resource surplus grew from US$15 million in 1966-67, to
US$60 million in 1969-70. These favorable developments were due, in part, to
rising copper prices which increased by over 25 percent between 1967 and 1970
and to an increase in copper production which rose from 317,000 tons in 1966
to 385,000 tons in 1970.

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



5.        In 1970-74 GIJP growth slowed to about 5 percent.  Possibilities of
growth based on unutilized capacity in tile manufacturing and service sectors
gradually narrowed. Government policies favoring investment in mo(iern infra-
structure (power, civil aviation, construction works) consumed resources that
could have been made available to more directly productive sectors.   Lack of
appropriate project evaluation. and selection processes resulted in the initia-
tion of investment projects whose return would not help the servicing of the
external debt contracted for their financin.   .ioreover, these projects
absorbed a large part of tihe country's limited management resources, and re-
dluced its capacity to borrow for economically justifiable projects. Neglect
of agriculture and particularly acdverse pricing policies leci to declining
agricultural production, andi to further diversion of resources to food imports
for urban consumption.
6.        Copper exports, which provided, on average, about 40 percent of
govermnent revenues and two thirds of export earnings, were always important
in Zaire's financial structure. But increasinc recourse to deficit financing
for government expenditures, and to foreign indebtedness for the expansion of
investments, greatly increased the economy' s vulnerability to the fluctuations
of copper prices, particularly as the government made no attempt tc pursue any
anti-cyclical budget or reserve policy. Iigh copper prices in 1973 and in the
early part of 1974 propelled government expenditures to very high levels which
made contraction difficult after copper prices declined againi.
7.        Growth of total government e2:penditures accelerated progressively
from an annual rate of about 5 percent in 1971-72 to 26 percent in 1973 and
66 percent in 1974, far beyond thle resources that could be mobilized dornesti-
cally. The Governmient deficit in 1974 reached 28 percent of expenditures, or
over 10 percent of GDP, and was entirely financed by recourse to the banking
system.  This, together with expansion of credit to nationalized firms, led to
severe price inflation, which reached a yearlv rate of about 30 percent in 1974
and 40 percent in 1975.
8.        The structure of the country's external trade was weakened by the
decline of export agriculture starting in the early 1970's. The prevailing
exchange rate increasingly favored the exp;lr,;iun of import demand, while wiping
out most incentives for exports. The share of copper in merchandise exports
rose from 60 percent in 1972 to 70 percent in 1974.   Imports of goods and ser-
vices rose at the yearly rate of 34 percent in 1973-74. In 1974, wnen export
earnings were at an all-time record level of US$1,340 million - almost twice
the 1972 level - and extern.a!. borrowing reached an unprecedented US$400 million,
the country's international reserves were drawfn down by US$110 million.
9.        Attempts by the Government in 1973 and 1974 to transfer foreign-owned
assets in agriculture, industry and commerce to private or public Zairian owner-
ship, without adequate advance preparation, further disrupted the modern sectors
of production and distribution. The Angolan conflict added to these difficulties
in 1975 by pushing government expenditures upwards, and by disrupting the estab-
lished traffic pattern to and from the copper region of Snaba. This combination
of government policies coupled withi the external factors such as the fall in
copper prices, and continuing increase in import prices, led directly to the
severe financial crisis that the country has been experiencing since early 1975.



- 3 -
10.       In 1975, especially in the second half of the year, the country was
faced with a severely confining situation. GDP was declining at the rate of
3 percent and Der capita consumption in real terms by about 8 percent. Un-
employment was growing. The country's international reserves were virtually
exhausted.  Tmports of basic necessities were reduced and widespread scarcities
were appearing in the country. Service payments on several external debts due
in the second half of the year could not be made for lack of foreign exchange.
11.       Zaire's medium and long term external debt outstanding at the end of
1975, including undisbursed, was provisionally estimated at US$2.6 billion as
comDared to US$760 million three years earlier. The disbursed Dortion of the
debt at the end of 1975 was about US$1.5 billion of which about US$55 million
is owed to the Bank Group. Service payments falling due in 1975 amounted to
US$240 million and will be about US$300 million in 1976, assuming no change in
the schedule of existing debt.
12.       To deal with the worsening economic and financial situation, the
Government attempted in early 1975 to restrict the budget deficit, to reduce
the expansion of credit and to allocate scarce foreign exchange to priority
payments, i.e., servicing external debt, transfer of expatriate salaries, and
imDort of essential raw materials. In addition, the Government contracted a
loan for US$50 million from Abu Dhabi for balance of payments support, and
drew about US$90 million from the IMF, about one half of which was secured
under the 1974 Oil Facility.
13.       Given the size of the difficulties inherited from the earlier years,
these measures could only have mixed success. Overall government expenditures
in 1975 amounted to US$1,326 million, about 11 percent less than in 1974. Due
to a large shortfall in government revenues, however, the deficit remained
high: US$460 million, compared with US$410 million in 1974. Expansion of
credit to enterprises was substantial. The foreign exchange allocation system
failed to provide for the servicing of medium and long termr. debt on schedule,
and shortages of raw materials, spare parts and other essential imports slowed
down domestic production and caused hardship for consumers.
14.       Imports of goods and services in 1M75 are estimated at about US$1,690
million, or about 9 percent lower than in 1974. The current account deficit
in 1975 was, however, larger than in 1974; US-55J0 million, as compared to
US$390 million. Despite substanitial amounts of capital inflows and accumula-
tion of commercial arrears, the country's international reserves fell from about
US$200 million in December 1974 to US$90 million in December 1975, represent-
ing less than one month of imports of goods and services.
15.       Since November 1975, the Government, in consultation with the IMF, has
been working on a comprehensive stabilization program. This program, on the basis
of which the IMF, in March 1976, agreed to a one year stand-by arrangement, pro-
vides for: a new central exchange rate, effective March 12, 1976, SDR 1 = Zl, repre-
senting a 1. n  adjustment  compared with a previous rate of US$2 = Zl; limiting the
government deficit in 1976 to Z60 million, while providing tax relief for Gecamines,
the Government-owned copper company; other measures to correct the disequilibrium

in the balance of payments and to orPJii inilaLion under control, inclulding
renegotiation of external dett, increasing agricultural producer prices and
investment in agriculture, setting liirits to credit expansion and to wage
increases in 1976, and abstaining from external borrowing witn a maturity of
less than 10 years, except for loans related to priority projects under imple-
mentation, and finally, improving the financial position of enterprises by
assuring imports of materials andc supplies, appropriate pricing policies and
by clarifying issues related to ownership and management responsibility of
nationalized enterprises.
16.       As part of the stabilization prograin, the Government had already
offered, in November 1975, to return 40 percent of the shares of nationalized
firms to the original owners, and declared its willingness to consider trans-
ferring management responsibility to them. Negotiations between former owners
and the Stabilization Committee of the Government are uniderway    witlh a view to
resolving the practical issues of implementation.
17.       The major issue the Government of Zaire faces in its task of stabiliz-
ing the economy is the establishment of an orderly decision 7¢ hanism for ex-
penditures.   Investment decisions should be made with a clear view of priorities
and the available financial means. Budget and credit policies, and external
borrowing should be managed accordingly.    Despite some progress, the Govern-
ment has not succeeded so far in making full use of the Planning Unit in the
Office of the President which is reinforced by a team of advisors provided by
the Bank under a UNDP-financed project.
18.       The recent stand-by agreement with the I.F, and the creation of a
Stabilization Committee to oversee the implementation of the program are en-
couraging steps toward improved economic management. A reasonably successful
implementation of the stabilization program and about US$150 million equiva-
lent that Zaire can now purchase from the IMF can set the stage for economic
recovery. To correct the basic imbalances of the economy and to have the
development process affect the life of Illost Zairians will require longer and
more continuous efforts.
19.       Even assuming the successful implementation of corrective policies,
Zaire's export earnings and government revenues will continue in the near
future to be heavily dependent on the price of copper.     After a decline in
1975, world copper prices are expected to recover substantially during the
remainder of the decade, although in real terms they are unlikely to regain
the average of the 1970-75 levels. Zaire's export earnings are expected,
nevertheless, to grow by about 19 percent per annum in 1976-3(' in current terms,
and about 4 percent in real terms, mainly on account of mining, expansion plans.
Apart from copper, Zaire has the potential to produce riany comrodities for which
market prospects are favorable, tropical woods, manv agricultural products, and
several minerals, including petroleum.



- 5 -
20.       Assuming that copper prices will rise to an average of 67 US cents/lb
in 1976 and $1.2 in 1980, gross capital inflow requirements are expected to be,
on average, about US$720 million a year in 1976-80, compared with a yearly
average of US$530 million in 1973-75. Thus annual average inflow for 1976-80
would be about 36 percent higher than the average for 1973-75, but this would
represent no change in real terms. The debt service ratio would rise from
11.8 percent in 1974 to about 22 percent in 1977, and about 21 percent around
1980, without taking into account debt rescheduling.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ZAIRE
21.       From 1969 thru 1974, Zaire received eight IDA credits totaling US$72
million for transport, development finance company operations, agriculture and
education projects. The Bank has also extended grants totalling US$400,000 as
a coadtribution toward the cost of two planning assistance missions in Zaire.
Three new loans/credits were signed with Zaire in 1975: a Bank loan of US$100
million for the Gecamines Mining Expansion Project, which provides for special
repayment arrangements tied to copper export receipts; an IDA credit of US$26
million for a Third Highway Project; and an IDA credit of US$26 million for a
Railway and River Transport Project. The IFC, which has a US$760,000 parti-
cipation in the Societe Financiere de Developpement (SOFIDE), the local deve-
lopment finance company, is making a major effort to identify projects in
Zaire suitable for its financing.
22.       Until now, Bank Group assistance to Zaire has been small compared to
the needs of the country. An important limiting factor has been the inadequate
project preparation and implementation capability of the Government, but this
constraint is slowly being overcome. Furthermore, through the cofinancing
arrangements for the Gecamines Project, the Bank Group took a major step in
1975 toward assuring that other external capital assistance available to Zaire
was effectively directed toward high priority projects.
23.       Disbursements on past IDA credits have been slow and amount to only
about US$40 million to date. Project implementation has also been poor due
primarily to the country's inadequate supply of trained manpower and management
capacity. For example, execution of the First Education Project (1971) was
delayed because of administrative weakness, and faulty selection and coordina-
tion of foreign consultants. Cost overruns on this project will require that
it be reduced in scope. Also, the technical assistance component of the
Second Highway Project (1972) was poorly implemented and the civil works only
started last year due to the shortage of experienced local personnel, diffi-
culties in recruiting key expatriate experts, delays in procurement and in the
implementation of organizational reforms. On the other hand, certain autonomous
entities which have benefitted from IDA and Bank Loans, the Development Finance
Company, the National Livestock Development Authority, the National Transport
Authority (ONATRA) and Gecamines, are executing IDA-financed projects in an
acceptable manner. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC investment as of August 31, 1975, and notes on the status of
ongoing projects.



- 6 -
24.       A main objective of Bank Group operations in Zaire has been insti-
tution-building and slow project implementation may be expected. The Zairian
DFC, SOFIDE, was established with assistance from IFC and IDA. The River
Transport Project helped strengthen the agencies concerned with waterways;
i.e., the Office National des Transports (ONATRA), the Regie des Voies
Fluviales (RVF), and the Regie des Voies Maritimes (RVM). The Railway and
River Transport Project continued this assistance and provided funds for a
major management training program for ONATRA. The First, Second and Third
Highway Projects provided technical assistance to establish and operate the
Bureau of Roads. The Education Project included a manpower survey to furnish
data for a review of the education system, and the Livestock Project helped
establish the National Livestock Development Authority which has since acquired
responsibilities beyond the project area.
25.       The Bank Group's main sectorial effort is directed towards assisting
in the rehabilitation and improvement of transport, agriculture and education,
all high priority sectors in which the Bank Group should be able to make a
contribution to institution-building. Secondary emphasis is being placed on
development firance company operations and water supply. This concentration
should assist the Government to design and implement appropriate policies in
these critical sectors. In most projects this will mean providing for transi-
tional technical assistance and training.
26.       Lack of transport is the major physical impediment to the country's
development. The Government has placed considerable emphasis on the improve-
ment of its river/rail arterial network and the Association is helping to
finance both studies and new investments designed to extend and improve this
system. At the same time, roads are essential for inter-regional commerce,
and as a feeder network for the development of agriculture. Agriculture has
received insufficient attention from the Government. In agriculture prefer-
ence should be given in the short run to increasing agricultural production,
including the development of large scale plantations, while the capacity to
implement rural development projects is established in the Government. In
education, there is a need for curriculum reform and emphasis on non-formal
and vocational education, especially agricultural training. In this area our
purpose will be to assist the Government in framing appropriate policies
through project formulation. In industry, we propose to continue our support
for the local Development Finance Company (SOFIDE). In the area of public
utilities, our assistance would be directed toward assuring broader access to
these essential facilities and strengthening the executing agencies.
27.       An expansion of the Bank Group's activities in Zaire will be possible
only if substantial efforts toward improving the country's economic management
are initiated and sustained progress is achieved. Considering the state of
disintegration within the country in the early 1960s, the political and econo-
mic cohesion attained since then has been noteworthy. However, the lack of a
comprehensive investment plan, the rapid rise in public expenditures and exter-
nal borrowing, the present shortage of reserves, the tenuous debt service



situation of the Government, and the insufficient allocation of resources to
agriculture are serious problems which have to be corrected if the overall
economic potential of the country is to be realized. The Government is aware
of the pressing need to take corrective action and has in cooperation with the
IMF initiated a stabilization program discussed above. The Bank is also
assisting the country through the UNDP-financed Planning Assistance Project,
for which the Bank is Executing Agency, the expanded country mission, and
EDI seminars on planning.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
28.       Zaire extends over 2,346,000 km2 of which about one quarter, the
central basin and the North, is covered by equatorial rain forest, bordered
to the East and South by hilly or mountainous savanna. The Zaire River drains
virtually the entire country and average annual rainfall v2ries from 1 to
1.8 m. The average population density is low, about 10/km and the rate of
growth of the some 23 million population is about 2.6 percent per year. The
urban population increased threefold in the ten years after independence, but
growth, which averaged about 10 percent per year, is now stabilized and is not
likely to exceed 6 percent per year over the next decade. There are 11 cities
with a population of over 100,000 and about 100 towns with more than 2,000
inhabitants. Total urban population is more than six million and is expected
to pass the eight million mark by 1980. Zaire's towns and cities have grown
in an orderly fashion, but urban population density is low and large areas of
its cities are without municipal services.
Organization of the Sector
29.       Urban water supply is the responsibility of a state corporation,
Regideso, the proposed executing agency for the project. Rural water supply
comes under the Office for Rural Development in the Agriculture Department;
sewerage and drainage are, in theory, the responsibility of the Public Works
Department (Service of Land Uses and Urban Roads). The budget and personnel
of the Office for Rural Development and the Service of Land Uses and Urban
Roads are quite inadequate. Virtually no developments, repairs or maintenance
are carried out in connection with rural water supplies or sewerage, and both
need thorouRh institutional reorganization. Institutional and feasibility
studies in sewerage, starting with Lubumbashi and Matadi, have been recom-
mended by a WHO/IBRD sector study (Study of the Water Supply, Sewerage and
Drainage Sector, Report No. 324a-ZR, of March 29, 1974).
30.       The Regie des Distributions d'Eau et d'Electricite de la Republique
du Zaire (Regideso) was set up in the 1920's by the colonial government to
supply water in urban areas and electric power in towns it served not connected
to the main grids of Shaba, Kinshasa or Bukavu. It is a public enterprise



- 8 -
with a commercial character whose General Manager is appointed by the
President of the Republic. There is no board of directors. Apart from the
setting of tariffs and the formial approval of its annual revenue budget and
of major items of capital expenditure by the Commissioners of State for
Finance and Energy, the General Manager has full authority.
31.       Regideso operates all urban water supply systems in the country.
There are 55 such systems presently and Regideso plans to increase the number
to 60 in the near future. It also distributes electric power in 42 of these
cities and towns and operates diesel generating plants in 26 of the localities
which do not have access to hydroelectric sources. Roughly two-thirds of
Regideso's operations relate to water supply and one-third to electricity.
In addition to Regideso's Head Office located in Kinshasa, there are nine
regional offices, located in the chef-lieu (principal administrative center)
of each region. Regional Directors have responsibility for water supply and
electricity operations in their region. They are assisted by a chief engineer
and a regional accountant.
Urban Water Supply
32.       There is no piped water in the new suburbs of the major cities, and
in about 50 towns of more than 2,000 inhabitants. Thus, more than two-thirds
of Zaire's urban population has to draw its water from pits and wells or from
the nearest springs or streams. The lack of safe water is a primary reason
for the relatively high incidence of water-borne disease in Zaire. The 55
existing urban water supply systems serve about 126,000 connections, or less
than three per 100 urban dwellers, and the number of connections is increasing
at a rate of only about 2 percent per year. There are very few standpipes:
about 700 altogether in the urban areis (Kinshasj has only two). The average
price of water is 5urrently Z .1325/m, US$0.16 m (US$0.62/1000 gal). The
price of US$0.16/m is about average for African cities.
33.       Ample water is usually available at a short distance from most urban
centers, principally from large rivers. Since river water requires treat-
ment, such plants are in widespread use, and give rise to operating problems
and to the need for skilled personnel. A few cities rely on groundwater, which
should be more exploited as a potential source of supply because of its lower
cost and better quality. Existing pumping, treatment and distribution facili-
ties have been allowed to deteriorate: available installations generally
cannot cope with demand; reservoirs and mains are often empty and unaccounted
for water is as high as 30 to 50 percent. The quantity of water distributed
in urban areas is usually inadequate and often of questionable quality.
34.       Between 1960 and 1966, there was no investment in the sector.     With
the help of government grants of about Z 2.8 million, Regideso rehabilitated
some parts of its water and electricity supply systems between 1967 and 1973.
As a part of this rehabilitation, Regideso constructed a treatment slant and
a pumping station for Kinshasa capable of producing about 100,000 m /day, thus
doubling the city's production capacity. The construction of additional mains
and the extension of storage reservoirs for Kinshasa is now under way, financed
by a European Investment Bank loan of 5.8 million units of account (about US$7
million). Other funds have been made available by the Government and small scale

extensions and rehabilitation works are proceeding in Mbuji-Mayi, Lubumbashi,
Matadi, Gemena, and other places.
35.       The WHO Sector Study identified the constraints to be overcome in
order to develop this sector in a rational manner, and recommended a develop-
ment program which Regideso has already begun to carry out. The development
strategy outlined in the WHO Sector Study gives priority to the major cities
which are also regional or district capitals. The rationale is that in
these cities the risks to public health are more serious, and that a greater
number of people, in particular the urban poor, would be served at reasonable
cost. Moreover, there would be less strain on Regideso's thinly spread,
qualified technical staff.
36.       The WHO Study recommended that the distribution of water be extended
mainly through public standpipes, as the best way of satisfying at least par-
tially the extensive needs with the least capital investment. At the same
time, an appropriate system of collecting charges for water supplied by stand-
pipe would have to be instituted.
Rural Water Supply
37.       The need for potable water in rural areas, where the population lives
mostly in villages with easy access to relatively unpolluted surface water
with continuous flow, is less urgent than in the cities. Before
independence, there were a number of small rural water supply systems; it is
estimated that there were about 1,500 standpipes and about the same number of
wells in the villages. The number of these facilities was still far from
sufficient to meet the country's needs, yet many of them have fallen into dis-
repair. The proposed WHO strategy for rural water supply is to set up a small
unit within the Agriculture Department to start rural "self-help" schemes and
to train personnel who could thereafter assist in the expansion of such rural
systems.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       The Appraisal Report for this project entitled "Zaire, Water Supply
Project" (No. 898-ZR, dated March 24,1976) is being distributed separately. A
Loan and Project Summary is in Annex III. The project represents approximately
half of Regideso's investment program for 1975-78 and would provide for the
construction or expansion of production and distribution facilities in six
major cities, their rehabilitation, technical services for Regideso and a
comprehensive training program for its staff, as well as feasibility studies
for additional water supply projects.



- 10 -
39.       The project is based on the above mentioned WHO sector   study.  With
Government support, Regideso began implementation of the sector study recom-
mendations and two consulting firms, IGIP (Germany) and IEU-Dumons (France)
carried out feasibility studies for the six major cities included in the project.
The project was appraised in January-February 1975 and negotiated in Washington
from November 19 to 21. The Government Delegation was led by Mr. Nsungani,
Legal Adviser in the Office of the President, and, Mr. Tshiongo, Director
General of Regideso. Representatives of BADEA and ADB participated in the
negotiations. This project is the first Bank Group operation in the water
supply sector in Zaire.
40.       The cities included in the project are:   Lubumbashi, Kisangani,
Kananga, Mbuji-Mayi, Mbandaka and Kamina. Each of them is a major regional
center. Two of them have populations of over 400,000; two of them have
populations of about 200,000, and the remaining two are at about the 100,000
population mark. By the year 1980, the total population of the six cities is
expected to exceed two million. As a result of the project, the 60 percent
of the population of these cities not now served or inadequately served by their
municipal water systems, will be supplied with potable water, mostly through
public standpipes. The percentage of water delivered by standpipe would reach
90 percent in the very low income suburban villages. The following are the
major project elements by city:
Lubumbashi is the capital city of Shaba Region, the headquarters of
a number of mining companies and a seat of university learning second only to
Kinshasa in economic importance. Its population was estimated at 400,000 in
1973. Three quarters of the urban agglomeration is served by municipal
water, but services are inadequate in two thirds of the areas supplied. 3The
proposed pr2ject would increase the capacity of the system from 41,000 m /day
to 85,000 m /day. Three new storage reservoirs, two pumping stations, 16 km of
transmission mains, 37 km of primary distribution pipes, secondary distribution
pipes of about 90 km and 300 standpipes would be provided.
Kisangani located on the Zaire River, 1,700 km from Kinshasa, is a
transit and communications center with a university, but with only a few small
industries. It is the capital of the Haut-Zaire Region and has been designated
as a "Third Development Pole". Its population is about 200,000. The main
water production facility is a treatment plant and pumping statirn badly in
need of rehabilitation. The project provides for a new 20,000 m /day treatment
plant, new transmission mains totaling 92 km including 10 km for primary dis-
tribution, three new storage reservoirs, a small plant and distribution system
and 145 standpipes.
Kananga is primarily a railway center. It has a present population
of about 400,000. About 40 percent of the population is served through 4,600
connections and 67 standpipes, many of which are not in operating cosdition.
The proposed project would quadruple production capacity to 24,000 m /day.
The 450,000 persons expected to be living in urbananized sections of the city
by 1980 will be served about 30 percent through private connections and 70
percent through standpipes. The water would be d awn from the Tshibashi River
and pumped a distance of about 7 km to a 24,000 m /day treatment plant near the



center of the city incorporating treatment facilities, a 2,000 m   reservoir
and a pumping station. Twenty kilometers of transmission mains would be laid,
as well as 20 km of primary and 24 km of secondary distribution pipes. Some
130 additional standpipes would be installed.
Mbuji-Mayi, the capital of Eastern Kasai, has grown up around the
Miba Company (Societe Miniere de Bakwanga), a diamond mining company, and has
a population of over 200,000. Its water supply relies on a skeleton system
currently undergoing improvement. The project w9uld expand a pumping station
at nearby springs to a peak capacity of 16,000 m /day.    A transmission main
would connect the springs to the commercial center. Two new reservoirs would
be constructed. The distribution system would include 20 km of primary, 55 km
of secondary distribution mains and 130 additional standpipes.
Mbandaka, capital of the Equateur Region and major river port, lies
on the Zaire River, close to important plantations. Its population is 120,000.
A treatment plant and pumping station would be constructed on the Zaire river
to supplement an existing one. A treated water reservoir would be built,
1.3 km of transmission mains, 46 km of primary and secondary distribution
pipes would be laid and about 90 standpipes installed. The existing treatment
plant would be rehabilitated.
Kamina, the administrative center of a sub-region of Shaba, is an
important junction of the Shaba-Kasai and Shaba-Kivu railway lines and also
an army depot. Kamina's population is just under 100,000. New boreholes
would be dug and the existing treatment plant rehabilitated. Primary and
secondary distribution mains, 9.6 km and 7.5 km long would be laid. A water
tower and about 30 standpipes would be included in the system.
Training Program
41.       Consultants employed by IDA carried out a complete study of Regideso's
manpower requirements and have drawn up a training program, the objective of
which is to ensure that Regideso has enough trained staff to operate its new
and existing installations efficiently. At present, a shortage of competent
technicians and engineers has led to excessive division of responsibilities at
all levels and, therefore, to overstaffing as well as poor operating results.
Existing institutions of learning in Zaire cannot satisfactorily train the
number of staff Regideso needs in the various fields. Regideso must, there-
fore, take steps to meet its own training needs: 445 staff, of which 173 have
yet to be recruited, need to be trained over the next five years in order to
man all 60 water systems.
42.       The proposed program is made up of on-the-job and workshop training,
classroom teaching and "recycling" classes; seminars would be organized for
managerial staff; overseas training would also be considered for specialists



- 12 -
and managers. Twelve expatriates are needed to start the program and to staff
it for the first five-year period. The training program is a key component of
the project and the UNDP has agreed to make grants of US$1.6 million to cover
start up costs of the program and the foreign currency compensation of expa-
triates. Some foreign costs, e.g., equipment and overseas training, would be
financed by IDA.
Technical Assistance and Feasibility Studies
43.       IGIP, of Darmstadt, Germany, has been selected to design the new
water supply system for four of the six cities included in the project and to
supervise their construction. IGIP would also train Regideso's staff in pro-
ject management and supervision as well as in leak detection and correction.
IEU-Dumons, a French consortium, has been engaged for the design and construc-
tion supervision of the other two cities, Kisangani and Mbandaka. Feasibility
studies for the extension and rehabilitation of the sewerage systems of Matadi
and Lubumbashi have also been included in the project.
Financing
44.       The total project cost   is estimated at US$70.4 million of which
US$39.2 million would be in direct and US$2.8 million in indirect foreign
exchange costs. The total loan and grant financing available would cover
the direct foreign exchange cost.   The IDA contribution of US$21.5 million
constitutes approximately 33.5 percent of total project cost, excluding
taxes, and 55 percent of the direct foreign exchange required for the pro-
ject. The following table shows the principal categories of expenditure:
In US$ Millions
Local       Foreign       Total

Materials imported directly for the project are exempt from customs duties
and taxes. However, many construction materials for the civil works would be
purchased by contractors in the local market and hence would be taxed. The
amount of import duties and taxes is estimated at US$6.3 million equivalent,
or 9 percent of the total project cost.



- 13 -
45.       On March 12, 1976 the zaire was adjusted by approximately 41 percent
from its former exchange rate of 1 zaire = US$2 to 1 zaire = 1 SDR or approxi-
mately US$1.18. For the economic analysis of the project a shadow rate of US$1.25
= 1 zaire was used and thus this realignment is consistent with one of the prin-
cipal assumptions of the Appraisal Report. The cost of the project in local
currency expressed in US dollar equivalent would be reduced by about 41 percent
or about US$12 million. Regideso receipts expressed in foreign exchange will, on
the other hand, be substantially reduced due to the change in parity and by early
1977 water rates should be increased by at least 10 percent in order to maintain
Regideso's contributions to its own investment program and to meet its debt
service obligations.
46.       The financing plan is as follows:
In US$ Millions
IDA Credit                                       21.5
BADEA Loan                                       10.0
ADB Loan                                          6.1
UNDP Grant (for training element)                 1.6
39.2
Regideso's internal cash generation              31.2
Total                         70.4
47.       The IDA Credit would be relent to Regideso at 8-1/2 percent for 25
years including five years of grace. The ADB Loan has been made to Regideso on
tbke following terms and conditions: 15 years for repayment including four years
grace at 7 percent per annum.   The BADEA Loan,substantially negotiated at the
same time as the Bank loan, is expected to be signed in late April. The loan is
to the Government with the proceeds of it to be relent to Regideso at 4 percent
interest for 25 years including five years of grace. BADEA has asked the Bank
Group to supervise the project on its behalf and approve all requests for dis-
bursements.
48.       The proposed IDA Credit would finance:   100 percent of the total
cost of the imported pipe and 24 percent of the total cost of reservoir construc-
tion, and pipe-laying for Kisangani, Mbuji-Mayi and Mbandaka; 51 percent of the
total cost of water production facilities and rehabilitation of existing water
supply systems for Kisangani, Mbuji-Mayi, Mbandaka and Kananga; 7 percent of the
foreign exchange cost of detailed engineering and construction supervision for
all six cities and new feasibility studies. BADEA will finance 100 percent of
the foreign exchange cost of the construction of new water supply facilities and
rehabilitation of the existing systems in Lubumbasbi and Kamina; ADB will finance
100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of const:uction of the new water supply
system in Kananga, except for some production facilities. The UNDP grant will
cover 93 percent of the foreign cost of the training program.

Procurement and Disbursement
49.       All contracts over US$60,000 financed by the proposed Credit will
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank/IDA guidelines on procurement, and will allow for the usual preferences
of 15 percent to domestic suppliers and 7-1/2 to domestic civil works contrac-
tors. Contracts for goods or works estimated to cost less than US$60,000 may
be procured through local competition in accordance with the Borrower's rules
of procurement which are acceptable to the Association. The laying of secon-
dary distribution pipes and the installation of standpipes do not lend them-
selves to large scale construction contracts, since they usually consist of a
scattered number of relatively small jobs. Local contractors are expected to
bid for these works. Regideso may also carry out these works on force account.
Civil works financed separately by ADB will be bid in accordance with its
procedures.
50.       Disbursements for the project will be made on the basis set out in
para. 48. Between August 1, 1975, and the eventual signing of the Credit, the
Borrower is expected to make payments of US$1.4 million to the consultants for
engineering services approved by the Bank. It is proposed that IDA finance
retroactively these expenditures.
Organization
51.       Regideso is a state-owned organization entrusted with urban water
supply throughout the country and with electricity supply in all but the
largest centers. It is required by its statutes to operate as a commercial
enterprise. Its organizational structure is sound, although heavily centra-
lized, and its administrative services and accounting department are adequate.
No change in its statutes or structure is proposed at this stage (see paras.
29-31).
Project Execution and Risks
52.       Regideso has agreed to set up a "Project Unit" of about nine engi-
neers and technicians within its Technical Department to administer and super-
vise the construction of the project with the assistance of the consulting
engineers (Section 3.02 of the Credit Agreement). The consulting engineers
(IGIP) will have the responsibility for progress reports and documentation and
will train Regideso's staff in contract administration, construction documen-
tation and project supervision. Detailed engineering started in September 1975.
According to the current schedule the major contracts would be awarded by
June 1976.
53.       Problems of delivery and inland transportation, and a shortage of
qualified contractors may lengthen the construction period. Provision has been
made for delays of about eight months in the supply of equipment to Zaire, its
installation and the completion of civil works, and as a consequence, the project
completion date is February 28, 1979. There is also a somewhat higher risk than
usual that project costs in local currency will increase more rapidly than anti-
cipated due to the relatively high rate of inflation experienced by Zaire in the
last two years and the still unclear impact that the recent currency realignment
could have on local prices.



- 15 -
Financial Analvsis and Tariffs
54.        Until 1973, Regideso's statutes required only that its revenues
should cover its operating costs and did not require the amortization of most
of the physical assets it manages for the Government. The Government was also
expected to pay for all new facilities. Regideso's revenues, therefore, barely
met its operating outlays. However, no debts were incurred. Under its new
statutes, however, Regideso is expected to finance a substantial Dart of its
investments out of internal cash generation and borrowings.
55.        Regideso has gradually introduced financial controls such as annual
revenue and expenditure budgets, monthly cash flow statements, sales statistics,
etc. Its annual financial statements are not properly verified at the present,
but it has agreed to employ professional auditors for its accounts. Records of
the company's assets were, for a long time, not properly maintained so that
the book values of its fixed assets are understated. A revaluation was carried
out at the end of 1973, and Regideso has agreed to incorporate the results in its
books.
56.         Until 1973, approximately two-thirds of Regideso's revenues were
derived from water and one-third from electricity. On the basis of a new water
tariff introduced recently, 85 percent of its revenues are now derived from water
and 15 percent from electricity. The estimated result for 1975 is net income on
water supply operations of Z 5.3 million. On the other hand Regideso is expected
to have had a 1975 loss of about Z 1.1 million on electricity operations. Regideso's
rate of return on average, net fixed assets in operation was barely positive in
1973, but, as a result of the new water tariff, it rose to about 12 percent in
1974 and was expected to exceed 14 percent in 1975-77. These results reflect in
part the low level of investment in recent years as well as the aforementioned
undervaluation of assets and Regideso's rate of return is expected to drop back
sharply after 1977 as the asset base is built up. The financial forecasts assume
that Regideso will receive Z .1325 per m3 of water sold from standpipes exclusive of
any cost of such sales. Regideso has agreed to present to the Association for its
approval plans for the public sale of water from standpipes (section 4.05 of the
Credit Agreement).
57.        Regideso's financial rate of return on project investments should
average 8 percent. Individual rates by city range from a low of 4 percent in
Kananga to a high of 11 percent in Kisangani. These latter figures do not
demonstrate the economic merits of the project, but rather indicate that water
price levels tend to be low in some project cities. The average rate for water
in Zaire is about US$.62 per 1000 gallons, about average for African cities. The
long term marginal cost of water varies considerably from city to city and uniform
national water tariffs, as exist presently, may not be appropriate. Regideso has
agreed, therefore, to commission a tariff study to review present water rates
(section 4.03 of the Credit Agreement).
58.        Regideso should be able to finance from internal resources all the
project costs for which financing has not been arranged, i.e., Z 15.6 million.
Should the cash flow projections for Regideso prove to have been unduly optimistic,
or if other factors, e.g., inflation in excess of the amount assumed, adverselv
affect Regideso's cash flow, Regideso is required to limit its borrowings for
other non-project water supply investments during project execution (Section 4.09
of the Credit Agreement). The balance of Regideso's investment program for 1975-78,
exclusive of power projects which the Government has agreed to finance in their
entirety (Section 4.07 of the Credit Agreement) and an EIB-financed water project,



- 16 -
totals about Z 16 million. The Government has agreed to continue to provide
Z 2 million annually to Regideso for investment in new water supply facilities
at least until 1978 (see Section 4.07 of the Credit Agreement). The Government has
also agreed to pay Regideso promptly for water and power services it receives
and to amortize arrears (about Z 4 million) it owes the company thru equal
payments spread over the next two years (Section 4.06 of the Credit Agreement).
59.         In view of Regideso's anticipated rapid growth, it is considered
desirable to link cash flow to its fixed asset base to ensure that it can
self-finance a reasonable proportion of future investments. The Government has,
therefore, agreed to maintain water and electricity tariffs at a level that
would allow Regideso's net internal cash generation (i.e., gross revenue minus
all cash payments other than for capital expenditures)in any calendar year to be
equal to at least 7 percent of the net value of fixed assets in operation,
periodically revalued, plus construction work in progress (Section 4.08 of the
Credit Agreement). With regard to Regideso's operating losses on its unprofitable
electricity operations, the Government has agreed to cover them (Section 4.04
of the Credit Agreement). To accurately determine the amount of such losses,
Regideso is allocating its central and regional overheads to power and water
operations in accordance with sound principles of accounting.
Benefits
60.        The project will improve the supply of water in six major cities with
an aggregate population of 1.5 million, and about 1.0 million urban poor will
be served at a cost of about US$50 per additional consumer. Production facil-
ities will be rehabilitated and supplemented to provide continuous service and
distribution systems will be expanded to supply the entire urbanized area of
the six cities -- only about one-third of whose present population has access
to niped water. More than half of the new consumers are intended to be served
through standpipes. The project has been designed to supply water to the whole
population of the six urbanized areas by 1980. Among its other effects the
project is expected to substantially reduce the high incidence of waterborne
diseases among the urban poor.

Date: January 17, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project, based on UNDP-financed studies, consists of:
(a) rehabilitation of navigational aids, dredging facilities and equipment
for the Zaire River estuary; (b) improvements of navigation on the Kinshasa-
Ilebo waterway; (c) rehabilitation of the ONATRA river fleet; (d) provision
of experts to fill key positions in ONATRA, RVM and RVF; and e) a feasibility
study of the Voie Nationale, the combination of rail-river links between the
mining areas of Shaba and Zairian seaports. The river agencies have been set
up as autonomous public entities, and all contracts for goods and services
under the Credit awarded. Success has so far been limited by delays in
procurement, and by the difficulties of recruiting technical assistance of the
right caliber.   However, progress in implementing the project has improved
recently, although there are still delays in completing rehabilitation of the
navigation aids on the Kasai River and in completion of two buoy tenders. Finan-
cial constraints and management shortcomings in the Government agencies involved
in exectuting the project have delayed project completion, and the achievement of

operational efficiencies and financial objectives envisaged under it. The
original Closing Date, December 31, 1973, was extended twice to provide
additional time for recruitment of technical assistance and for works relnted
to the rehabilitation of markings on the Kasai River and reconditioning of two
dredgers. The new closing date is December 31, 1976.
Credit 271     Second DFC; US$10 Million Credit of September 24, 1971; EIffect-
ive Date: February 1, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Credit 463     Third DFC; UJS$10 Million Credit of February 20, 1974; Effective
Date: July 25, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
A first line of credit to SOFIDE was made in 1970 and was
fully disbursed. The second line of credit to SOFIDE was made one year after
the first, since SOFIDE's volume of operations was three times that forecast.
The Credit was not fully committed until December 1973, due to the availab-
ility to SOFIDE of other resources. A Zairian General Manager assisted by
an expatriate Senior Adviser replaced the Bank-seconded General Manager in
May 1973. The third line of credit to SOFIDE is almost fully committed.
SOFIDE's operations have been conducted in a manner satisfactory to the
Association.
Credit 272     Education; US$6.5 Million Credit of December 17, 1971; Effect-
ivc Datc:  "a-y 31., 1972; Closing  .tz:  April 30, 1977.
The project consists of construction and rehabilitation of
three teacher training colleges, a demonstration school and four technical
secondary schools, a management study and a survey of manpower requirements.
Implementation of the project is more than two and a half years behind schedule
and the credit closing date will have to be extended by about the samne period.
Rehabilitation work on one school in Kinshasa is nearing completion.    Tenders
were received for a school in Kisangani and indicated that a large cost
overrun (150 percent over the appraisal estimate) is likely. Conseauently,
the Department of Education has decided to reduce the scope of the works
to four high priority schools, postponing another four. The reduced
project would require an estimated US$7.0 million of additional financing.
The Department of Finance has expressed its readiness to supply the necessary
funds and an amendment to the Credit Agreement is being prepared. Following
the decision to reduce the size of the project, the Project Unit is proceed-
ing with the award of the furniture and equipment contracts for the schools
to be retained in the project. The management study has been completed
and the survey of manpower is proceeding well. The project is being monitored
very closely.

Credit 292      Second Highway; US$19 Million Credit of March 23, 1972;
Effective Date: September 11, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977.
The project, jointly financed by IDA, UNDP, CIDA, FAC and
USAID, consists of a comprehensive program to strengthen highway adminis-
tration and maintenance and to rehabilitate high-priority roads. All project
components, except rehabilitation works, have been completed. The main insti-
tutional objective of the project, the establishment of the Office des Routes
(OR) as a countrywide organization responsible for highways, was achieved.
Twelve contracts, awarded in early 1974 for rehabilitation of about 1,600 km
of roads, have progressed much slower than anticipated, due to the failure or
weakening of several contractors, delays in local 'payments and shortage of
critical supplies. By the end of 1975, about 600 km of road had been resur-
faced, that is about 40 percent of the total. Some contracts have had to be
cancelled or revised. The OR is now preparing proposals for submission to IDA
concerning completion of the program in the light of substantial cost overruns.
OR intends to complete some road sections with its own resources and to
concentrate available IDA funds on contracts covering 1,150 km where progress
is satisfactory. OR has strengthened field supervision as necessary to
monitor the ongoing contracts. The present Closing Date of December 31, 1977
may have to be extended.
Credit 398      Livestock Development; US$8.5 Mlillion Credit of June 21, 1973;
Effective Date: February 14, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1979.
The project is intended to develop three large Government
ranches in the Shaba region and to help establish a National Livestock Devel-
opment Authority. The project also provides substantial assistance (US$1.3
million) for the preparation of future agricultural projects. The consul-
tants for the implementation of the project are in place. The project en-
countered difficulties in the first year due to extensive burning of pasture
on the largest ranch, which 'led to high cattle mortality; however, a number
of measures have been taken to avoid a repetition of this. Both physical
execution of the project and construction of new ranch infrastructure are
proceeding well. The training of Zairian agricultural technicians is also
on schedule.
Loan 1090       Mining Expansion Project; US$100 Mlillion Loan of March 8, 1975;
Effective Date: December 2, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1978.
The project consists in expanding the production facilities of
the state-owned Generale des Carrieres et des Mines (GECAMINES) to produce an
additional 120,000 tons per year of refined copper and 4,000 tons per year of
cobalt in form of copper cobalt alloy. Project execution is well underway.
Due to declining copper prices, the company is encountering serious financial
problems which may impede its ability to generate the project financing to which
it is committed. The Government has given the highest priority to this pro-
ject and is attempting to solve these financial difficulties by tax rebates
and other measures taken in the framework of the stabilization program. The
transfer of marketing responsibilities to SOZACOM, a Zairian state-company,
has caused delays in the financing of GECANIINES shipments.    SOZACOtW's acti-
vities are being closely monitored.

Credit 536     Third Highway Project; US$26 Million Credit of March 19, 1975;
Effective Date:  July 31, 1975; Closing Date:    December 31, 1978.
The project, which is a continuation of the Second Higlhway
Project, is designed to build up an efficient highway administration, to
initiate sound hiighway sector planning and to assist with the rehabilitation
of a key road. It consists of the following elements: (a) provision of
technical assistance to the Bureau of Roads; (b) organization of two pilot
highway maintenance schemes; (c) establishment of a country-wide logistic
support system for highway maintenance; (d) rehabilitation of the gravel sur-
faced Kabinda Kindu road (about 600 km) (e) a highway traffic survey; and (f)
feasibility studies affecting about 1,500 km of roads. Tne total cost of
the project estimated at US$40 million including taxes is financed jointly
by IDA, UNDP, the Belgian and French Governments and the Government of Zaire.
Consultants are carrying out feasibility study of the Kikwit-Kananga road
and consultants have been retained to assist with the establishment of the
logistic support system for highway maintenance. The maintenance and technical
assistance components of the project have made a good start, and awards for
the first section of the Kabinda-Kindu road are being made.
Credit 571      Railway and River Transport Project; US$26 M1illion
Credit of July 11, 1975; Effective Date: November 18, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The project provides (a) technical assistance to ONATRA,
including a comprehensive training program; (b) finance for a major part of
ONATRA's 1975-77 investment requirements for river transport equipment,
railroad improvements and track renewal; and, (c) funds for additional river
markings on the Kasai river, port studies and a preliminary engineering study
for the Ilebo-Kinshasa rail,link. The Association is providing US$26 million
representing 100 percent of the foreign exchange component of the project.
The Government and ONATRA-will finance the local costs amounting to US$26
million. Due to management changes at ONATRA, the Project was somewhat slow
in getting started, but steady progress is now being made.
