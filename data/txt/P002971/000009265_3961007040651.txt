MEMORANDUM AND RECOM           ATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE ITERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUlVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOS1D CREDIT TO THE REPUBIC OF UGANDA
FOR A DISRCr HEALTH SERVICES PILOT AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECT
1.    I submi for your approval the folowig report and    mn  atono a proposed
developmet credit to the Republic of Uganda for SDR 30.9 million, the equivaleti of US$ 45
million, on standard IDA tenis with a matity of 40 years to help finance a Distict Heath
Services Pilot and Demo         Project. The following Govemndowr agences have agreed
to co-finance this project an a grant basis: ODA, U.K. (US$ 2.2 million); SIDA (US$ 7.0 million);
DANIDA (US$ 5.0 millimon); and KfW, Gmany (US$ 9.0 million).
2.    Sector Background TIe healt stats of Ugan's 17.5 million people is poor. Life
expectancy at birth is only 47 years; the crude death rate is 19 per 1000 population; the under-S
mortality rate is 185 per 1000 live births; and about 45% of chd   under-S in a survey wee
found to display low weigt-for-age, reflectg nutritional deficiencies. The leang caus  of
death ae AIDS, tbecosis, and malaria, for aduls; and malaria, pneumoia, and dihea for
children. The leadig causes of illness and death are all prventable, although with varying degrees
of difficulty. Uganda's health problems are md by a igh total f*rtility rate (CMR) of 7.1,
reflectig a conacetve prealence rate of only SYO, and yieldig a high popuation growt rate of
2.8%.
3.    The Government sector accounts for 62% of hospital beds and 58% of registered
outae  clinics. Government health fcilites suffer fiam a shortage of fiuids, particlarly for
essential supplies and phm cals, stsalaries and mcentvs, and routine maintace of
equipment and facilities. Althoug the non gvem_ sector accounts for only 38% of hospital
beds, it povides 54% of bed-days, eflectin greater capacity utilization and staff productvity.
Non Goverment Organizat  (NGO) pay their staff significanty more ftan the govenment
Health fties are well-distributed thouo   th country, except for the North wich is under-
served and existing facilites are in a state of dipair.
4.    The health sector will be affected in a major way by the Govermnenfs ongoing
decentration program, which transfer corl of most Governt serices from Central
Govemment ministries to Distict ovem s. Miistry heaquares  will be stemlind to a core
of policy makers, plas, and inspectors. The Local Governmen Statute, 1993, provides the
legal fiamework for dn, including changes in (a) persmonel manageent; (b) budget
and financial managcmet; and (c) actr fimcton, powers, and es
5.    Total heal spendig (public plus prvate) in Uganda stands at only $ 7.73 per capita
(Goverunent health expenditure, $ 2.82 per capita; household health exenditu, $ 4.91 per
capita), as compared with $ 11-19 per capita in most Sub-Saharan Afnican countries, and an
esfimated cost of $ 12.0 per capita in low-income countries to provide a mini_m packge of the
healh services whih are most cost-effective m avertig the Burden of Disease.' Analysis done for
h Burd  of Di  and te vyg Ceffiveneofiffenh t irvans are elaed in
Worfd Developmt Repot 1993: bwest  in HealtL



the BaWs Social Sgctor Strate  report fimud that Govemuent health expenditure was skewed
toward subsidization of curative servces in hospit Is, with pubhc halth and pvetive serces
seriously under-fimded32
6.    Project Objectives. The objective of this project is to pilot-test and demonstrate the
feasibility of deliverig an essenta health services package to dtrict populations, within a
prudent financial policy framework for the sector. These objectives will be pursued through an
integrated program of policy, institutional and financi improvemn nts, with close montoring.
7.    Accordingly, the proposed project would (a) pilot and test new sector policies and
staties which will fiitate  e imple      of esseial heat service; (b) strengthen
management and plame ig capacity at district levels so that they are prepared to provide essental
healh services; and (c) restucture the MOH so as to build its apcity to provide health policy
leadership and to support the Govermens decaon policy.
8.    Project Description. Pilot Acivities ( 8.2 million). This component would conbute
to the ongoing pilot activities in 3 decenalied districts where the delivery of an esseal
healt package to district popuations is being iutroduced. Tlis piloting phase wil essentially
consist of meaurng te absorptive capacity at the district level, testing diffrent ways of
deliverng the essential package to the populaoan and refining the package itself in lght of
expeinces gained. The operation of an APEX function witn the MOH for the proiion of
mnagrial and technical support to the 3 disticts woud also be part of the pilot pbase. This
componet will be carefully monitored by defining measurable indicators which will produce
tangble results. Based on these results, the project will move to th demonstion phase.
9.    Demonstration Activities ($ 19.1 million). Ihis component woud consist of the
implementation of a refined essential healffi services package il 7 addito    disticts and the
original 3. The number of districts to be selected for this   ont is indicative and will greatly
depend on the success of the initial pilot phase. Progess of the demonstraton actvies, with
emphasis on the admistative logistical aspects of service delivery would be reviewed periodically
(at least once a year) and the pace of exansionrplication in each distict would be d_etmnd on
the basis of appropriate perfomanc indicators.
10. Capacity Building for District Health Administrations ($ 36.7 million). This
component which would be implemented in al districts would conist of sbtg planning,
managemn and evaluion capacity of district health adminiaon, rehabilitation and equipment
of healh units, tr g and selective cou  on for budgeting, acconting, and healt
infonnation systms, and introduction of a Quality Assumance Program. This compnent woudd
also support the devisingof admistraive mechansms for sub contracting of sevices, promotng
private sector involvement and self govenua.
11.   Restructring and Capacity Building for MOH ($ 8.0 mmion). To implement the
Goverments dentralization policy, the prqject will help eorgze MOH. It will strengthen its
policy, planning and inspection fimctions emphasizing monitoring and evaluation, and improve
intemal efficiency.

12.   Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 1.2 milion). The program monitoringevaluation
activities will seek to determine the impact and cost effectiveness of the Heal programs as well as
to draw lessons fom the imple ion of programs to improve the manaemen and deivey of
all health services m Uganda. In addidion, both the monitorng and evaluation activities will
provide in aion to the project management during implementation diat will help in idetfy
necessary adjusents in progm design.
13.   Project ImplemeIn (US$ 2.0 minion). The Minstry of Health wil be responsible
for overall project coordinto. The Pennmaent Secrety, MOH will be the Project Director. The
exsting Project Coordinaton Unit (PCIU) fol IDA fiuded projects will be responsible for the
coordinaton of this project as well. It is headed by a senior Public Health Specialist who has been
designated the Project Coordinator. The PCU includes 1 project manager, 1 project admistator,
3 accountat, 1 procurent specialist, I eineer and 3 secreares. Short-term technical
assisace (preferably local) wil be engaged as necessary. Smce the bulk of the activities of the
project will be in the districts, SIDA has financed two district support teams comprising of
imlemenaon, fiancial and prmary health care specialists. These teams have been provided
with a vehicle each to travel to project districts on a monly basis.
14.   A Project Steering Committee chaired by the PS, MOK with representatives fom the
MOH, MOLO, and MOFP has been established to act as an advisory body. NGOs and other
3inerested parties will be imited to participate in the Committee on an ad hoc basis. The Project
Coordiator will be the Secretary to the Steering Committee. The Committee is expected to meet
quarterly.
15.   At the district level, the District Medical Officer will be responsible for coordinating
project activities. He will work closely with NGOs active in the district as well as with members
of the District Heth Teams and communty groups to ensure that srvices are provided to the
largest group of people within the framework ofthis project
16. The total project cost of US$ 75.1 million equivalent will be financed as follows: a
proposed IDA Credit of US$ 45.0 million; the Govanment will finance US$ 6.9 million; ODA,
SIDA, KfW (Genmany), and DANIDA will provide parallel financing totalling US$ 23 2 milion.
Details of project costs and financing plan are provided in Schedule A. Procemet arrgments
and credit allocation and disbursents are given in Schedule B. The timetable of key evens is
given in Sdule C. The status of Bank Group operations is summarized in Schedule D. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 13515-UG is being distributed separately. A map is also attached.
17.   Project Sustaiabty. As set out in the ter of Sector Policy it is epect   that there
will be increases in the real ,alue of: (a) Treasury resources flowing to the health sector; (b) user
charges; and (c) donor financig, eflecig the ilization of more rapid disbursement methods.
The Govermnent will provide an annual report on sectoral  endthu  and financing, no later tan
November 1 each year, beg    in 1995. This will be reviewed by IDA and discussed between
the IDA staff and the Government, with the objective of ensuring that domestic resources
mobilization efforts do not lag. Increased cost recovery for the less cost-efibtive health serices
will enable a greater share of Treasy fundx  for the health sector to be devoted to the most cost-
effective ("essential") health srvices. There is no commimet to havmg lower donor funding over
the medium tmen, either m absolute levels, or as a share of health financing, bae   such a
commit"in would be in istnt with the objective of providing the package of essential health
services to the Ugandan ppulaton. Over the long tenn, imprwed health aising from increased



4
provion of essetal hea  services will conbute to productvity. The capacity budi
coponent will stengthen fte district level administaion structues to deliver deenalized health
sevices. New management ysms for financial mana ntr, poumnt and monitoring wil
be establishd, both at district and cetr levels. The   activitis wil complement the ongowig
capacity building program of the Miisties of Local Govemment and the Decentlized
Secretaria. By pret completion, it is expected that Ugads health sysm would be much more
decentalzed and responsive to local needs, and would thus be more sustainable over the long tem.
18.   Lessons from Previous IDA Ivolvement IDA is financing an ongoing First Health
Project which becme effcive in 1988. In the early years implementon was slow but has
recenty picked up considerably and is expected to be completed on schedu by June 30, 1995.
Ih desig of the First Health Project was too ambitious in scope, based on good prior sector
analysis, but not fully anticipating te coaining effects of known risks, paticularly efficts
outside the health sector. It is therefe important to carefully assess the overall risks that could
hamper project impltion and to build sufficient safeuards and flexibilty into the project to
mite   potel risks. This project takes the lessons learned into account by piloting activities in
limited number of districts thereby allowing a ijustmets to be made before replicatig them to a
larer number of districts. Anmnal work plans and reviews will enable modifleatios to project
dsi  to be made promptly thereby reducing the risks of poor implemention.
19.   Rationale for IDA Involvement The health policy white paper was discussed in 1992/93
with the Bank and has since been approved by te Cabinet It provides the basis for poliy refirm.
Following the 1993 World Developamt report "Invesin in HeaW, the Goverments of Uganda,
Kenya and Tanzia with the assista  of the Bank embarked on an ambitious exercise to put into
practice some of the thories in the report. The teams developed health system profiles for their
counies, mcluding an analysis of the couies burden of disease, and the cost of effecti ss of
common commity, pmventi  and curative healt care interventions to combat these diseases.
Tbe teams also cstimatd amnnal health careexnditur  by the Govemnt, donors and the
prvate sector broke down by disease and type of intervention, and made ec ans based
on their findigs concerig how resources could be realocated and the estimated gain in life years
saved that would relt if these reallocatons occured. The proect is largely based on the findins
of the Ugandan Report By actively participatig in this exercise fte Bank has developed an
exellet dialogue with the Government on healti sector reforms; the Govemmen of Uganda has
requested Bank support to carry the reforms thrugh.
20.   The Comtry Assistance Strategy was dicussed at the Board on May 10, 1994 in
conjunction wifth the Second Structural Adjustment Credit. The prmary objective of the Bank
Group assistance to Uganda is to help te country lay the foundations for rapid, sutained and
equimble growth as an instument for poverty reduction. Ihe elements of this stategy are the
development of human capital, creation of a strong financial system, raising agricutural
prodacivity and buildg strong institutions. This project, through its focus on the poor is an
integral part of te Country Assistance Strategy. It will play a significant role in poverty reduction
and will result in the development of human capitl in the project disticts.
21.   Agreed Actions. Actions, which have been completed, include Goverment's submission
of an approved Letter of Sector Policy; the establishment of a high level Implementaion
Committ fobr efcting m      tand onizal  fms; an implem an plan for
mnagemn and organizadona refms for the first year of the project; the appointnt of a



S
project coordito, the establishment of a Project Steering Committee; and the submission of a
draft            manual for all project components.
22.   Ihe folowing would be a condiin of effecdves: the submission of a final
ihpaentatio mamual for all proect componens.
23.   Duing negotiions, assrnces were obtained that: (a) only districts whose recurrent
budgets hmve been decentralized by the central governmt be included in the prct; (b) progress
of the demonstration actives, wit emphasis an the adm is   and logincal aspects of
susainig sce deliveiy wil be reviewed periodically (at least onw a year) and the pace of
exan/replication in each district will be deemined on the basis of appropte perfonmac
indicators; (c) formal proposals from NGOs would be a proondon for project funding and ta
ammal reviews of all NGO actvites under the prqect would be carred out; (d) the pr- isin of
equipment fiom a pro-approved lst to privae health units be lihmted to those m under-served areas
and at a cost not exceedig US$ 25,000 per health unit; (e) only NGO units with satisfactory
management capabilities be conacted to supvi nearby Govement health units and
commuity based actiities and that for each such conrc a     dma evp d met plan for the
Goverment health umt with a set of monitorable indicators be prepared focusing on financing
sustainability and service use, (t) a traig instiaons supported under the proact would be
given the necessary a       and financial autoomy (except for the policy on admiions,
which sal be retaned by MOH), and ensure that, while the trang instiutions sball contiue to
be accountable to MOH for al tecnical matters, MOH will provide them with fundig tbr a
period of at least five years; ( studies and contactg out of services be completed no laterthan
the end of the first year ofthe project and hat the findings, together with a plan for imIple
Ofthe r    ens, be submitted to IDA for review and comment; (h) all changes to the
essal p         of health services be submied to IDA for review and commaent before
implementtion; (i) a mid-term ealuation of the project be held in 1997 and that the
implemeation evaluation report be prepared by the Goverment witbin 6 months of the project
closing date; (j) (i) the annual work programs be prepaed at the same time as the prepaation of
the annual national budget; (ii) relevant line items be inuded in the national budgt aimed at
providing adequate countepart fundig each year, and (in) the Goverment produce, on an aanua
basis, evidence that resources thus allocated in the previous year's budget were used for the
inteded purpose; (k) the Goverment would have the records and accounts of the Project,
including those for the Special Accounts and SOE's, audited for each fiscal year by idependent
auditrs acptable to IDA, and that it would submit the audit reports to IDA withi six months of
thie end of every fiscal year, with a separate opinion by the auditors on SOEs. Similarly, MOH
would have its accouns and those accounts of the vanous Districts, inclding SOEs, audited for
each fiscal year by idependent auditors acceptable to IDA and submit audit eports to IDA witi
six months of the end of every fiscal year with a separate opinion by the auditors on SOEs; and (1)
the project coordinator be acceptable to IDA during the entire imple aion period.
24.   A condition of disbursement for the demstatn component would be the succsful
completion of the pilot phase ofthe project.
25.   Poverty Category. The paage of essenal healh serices will be delivered to aR
Ugndan people, including the poor. The proposed shif twwd greater spending on preventive and
protve health will improve the heath stas of all people. Wtthin the curative budget, spending
will be shifted towards healtf centers and away from district hospits. Hence, the per visit
subsidy at health centers would increase and since the poor use health centers two to ee times



6
more ofken than the non-poor, the would be the mam beneficies of such reallocation.
Approximately 2 nillion women would direcfly benefit frem the project.
26.   Participatory Approach Ite project was prepared by the Govermment with assistnce
from outside consuln. In addiion, SIDA has financed thee districts m which pilot activites
are being arried out. he objectives and wctivies of the project have been formulated within the
framework of health plans prepared by district officials. In adion, N s and CBOs are
proiding continuous feedback on project impact.
27.   Environmental Aspects. The Project is classified as catgory C, wvith no adverse impact
on th evf ime
28.   Program Objective Categories. The program objectives which will be mpacted by this
project are:
Primary:     Health, Nutrition; and
Seconary:    Povety Alleviation.
29.   Benefits. The project will help reduce te burden of disease and thus improve the health
status of the population in the project districts through the mple ion oCsectoral poicy,
exendit  and insutonal reforms and through the introduction of the concept of essenal public
health and clinical pacages. It wil also serve as a vital pilot project for effctive decetaliaon,
ths conibuting thlough an evolvmg leanmg exercise to institution and capacity building and
overall susinabiity.
30.   Risks. Although the Govermnent is committed to d lizan, the imp    ion
capacity of the MOH and district level insttutions might prove inadea despit the reforms
proposed. The project is seeldng major changes in the way health servces are deivered, and
implementation will require the use of approaches (e.g. contracng out) which are at present
unfiamii  to district organizations. The project is designed to support distict administraion
though strong technical backstoppmg by the MOH and by proving traig in manage_me;
pLanning, accounting stock inventoly, drug supply mment, health infomation systems,
training and supervision of staff and monitoring and evaluation.
31.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreemnt of the Associaton and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
