INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMNMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UPPER VOLTA
FOR A LIVESTOCK PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Upper Volta for the equivalent of
US$9.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a livestock development
project.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The basic problems of economic development in Upper Volta were set
out in a report entitled "The Economic Development of Upper Volta" dated
November 27, 1970 (R70-237 and R71-2). An updating memorandum of January 13,
1972, was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 2, 1972 (R72-41).
An economic mission visited Upper Volta in March/April 1974; its draft report
was discussed with Government for comments and will be distributed to the
Executive Directors shortly. The mission's main findings are incorporated
in this report.
Background
3.        With a GDP per capita of about US$70 in 1972, Upper Volta is one of
the 25 "least developed countries" identified by the United Nations. The
country's economic structure is typical of a situation of extreme under-
development: agriculture and livestock provide a living for over 90 percent
of the population, but, with very low productivity, account directly for less
than 50 percent of GDP; manufacturing, closely linked to agriculture, provides
only 10 percent of GDP; the remainder comes from the service sector, which
includes the Government; exports, usually a dominant growth factor in most
African countries, represent only between 7 and 9 percent of GDP; despite
modest investment rates (8 to 10 percent), the resource gap was about 8 per-
cent of GDP until 1971, nearly doubled in 1972, and reached an unusually
high level of 20 percent of GDP in 1973.
4.        A number of years of mediocre rainfall since 1968 culminating in a
severe drought in 1973 have resulted in a serious setback in agricultural
production and overall economic stagnation. This is all the more serious be-
cause in the years since 1960 growth had been very limited, probably not
exceeding one percent per year per head. Compared to 1969/70 agricultural
production declined by 15 percent in 1970/71 and by 17 percent in 1972/73.
The most serious crop failures and livestock losses occurred in the northern



- 2 -
and central parts of the country, thus accentuating existing income dispari-
ties between regions. Emergency food imports were about 40,000 tons in
1971/72, 60,000 tons in 1972/73, and over 100,000 tons in 1973/74. Climatic
conditions in 1974 were normal, and crop production for 1974/75 should regain
the levels achieved in 1969/70. The drought has brought out more clearly
than ever the basic problem facing Upper Volta's rural sector: excessive
population pressure in the central region (the Mossi Plateau), resulting
from the very uneven population distribution throughout the country with
respect to available land resources: about 61 percent of the total population,
or 3.5 million people, live in this region which comprises only 32 percent
of the total area and is much less favorably endowed than the south and
southwestern regions from the view-point of both rainfall and soil quality.
This explains why the bulk of the migrants to other parts of the country and
to neighboring countries come from this region.
Financial Developments
5.        Despite the persistently large trade deficit, the overall balance
of payments has been in surplus over the six years, 1968-73. Even in 1974,
the Central bank's provisional figures show a surplus of US$10 million.
Net foreign assets tripled between 1968 and the middle of 1974 to reach over
US$70 million or about 8 months worth of imports of goods and non-factor
services. This was made possible by the increasing flows of both external
aid and private transfers, mainly Voltaic workers' remittances from the
Ivory Coast. In February 1974, the prices of refined petroleum products
doubled at delivery point in Upper Volta. Though consumption of petroleum
products is small, representing 6 percent of total imports (1972) and a very
low percentage of all the inputs used in the economy, they are the only source
of modern energy in the country and, therefore, little room exists for reducing
consumption. The hydroelectric potential is under study, but seems to be very
limited. Higher petroleum prices, combined with other rises, particularly
in import prices and in local wages (which were raised by 30 percent on April 1,
1974), have set the economy on an inflationary path, which is in sharp contrast
with the past. As a result if these developments, effective April 1, 1974
most workers received wage increases ranging from 3 percent to as much as
38 percent.
6.        Over the past six years the Treasury's liquidity position has re-
mained comfortable as a result of three factors: a policy of strict budget-
ary austerity applied since 1967 by the military regime, the continuation of
French budget subsidies, surpluses accruing from autonomous public institu-
tions, especially the Price Stabilization Fund for Agricultural Products and
special aid received in connection with the drought. The Government's
current budget turned from a deficit of CFAF 200 million in 1966 into a sur-
plus of CFAF 300 million in 1967, and since then a surplus of between
CFAF 300 and 900 million has been generated every year. The Government was
thus able to liquidate the stock of unpaid bills by 1969, and the public
sector as a whole has been able to gradually build up substantial reserves
with the Central Bank. These were negative in 1966 and close to CFAF 10
billion or 4-5 months of imports in mid-1974.



- 3 -
7.        This remarkable financial performance has been achieved at a cost,
however, with undesirable consequences that have, to some degree, hindered
economic development in three related ways: first, by excessively cutting
back operating funds of the Government's economic services; second, by
limiting the Government's capacity to participate in the financing of new
development projects; third, by making more difficult the needed follow-up
on a number of projects financed largely by external aid. Thus, while it is
essential for a country like Upper Volta to control carefully current expen-
ditures, it would seem nevertheless that the time is opportune now for a more
aggressive and development-oriented expenditure policy. The first manifest
example of this new orientation is the establishment of a new entity, the
Caisse Nationale de Depots et d'Investissements, which is designed to mobilize
savings from both public and private bodies and channel them into economically
and financially profitable undertakings. This institution started operations
in January, 1975 and has already committed CFAF 2.5 billion for development
projects mainly in the industrial and public utilities sectors and the roads
sector.
Foreign Aid
8.         Over the 12 years from 1960 to 1972, foreign aid disbursements
totalled about CFAF 91 billion ($360 million) or an annual average of
$30 million. About 90 percent of total aid disbursements have been grants
and the remainder loans, of which 90 percent on concessionary terms. Capi-
tal aid has constituted the largest component accounting for about 65 per-
cent of total aid, followed by technical assistance (20 percent).
9.         Foreign sources have financed more than two-thirds of total actual
investment expenditures under the first Development Plan (1967-70), and are
expected to finance about four-fifths of total estimated investment (CFAF 63.2
billion) under the second Development Plan (1972-76). The major sources of
aid have been the "Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation" (FAC) of France, and the
"Fonds Europeen de Developpement" (FED) of the European Economic Community.
These two agencies together have provided between 1960 and 1972 about 75 per-
cent of all foreign aid to Upper Volta, principally in the form of grants.
French aid has been quite diversified; for example for the period 1969-73,
about half the total was capital aid for specific projects; one fourth,
technical assistance; the remainder, "equipment grants" to the Government's
budget. French capital aid in 1972 was distributed as follows: infrastruc-
ture (65 percent), production development, i.e., agriculture (26 percent),
general studies (16 percent), and social equipment (15 percent). FED aid
has been entirely grant, mainly for capital projects. Highest priority
was given to agriculture (52 percent) and social sectors (42 percent) in the
first FED (1958-1963); to road construction (about half) in the second FED
(1964-68); to some large agro-industrial projects, such as the sugar plant
at Banfora in the third FED (1969-74). IDA is gradually becoming one of the
main sources of aid with total commitments as of December 31, 1974, of
$30.7 million (not including this project). Other aid agencies and countries
with sizeable programs now include UNDP, USAID, and the Federal Republic of
Germany.



- 4 -
10.       Outstanding external public debt at the end of 1973 was US$120
million, including an undisbursed amount of US$89 million. This figure
includes a loan of $44.5 million from the People's Republic of China. The
status and terms of this loan are not known as yet. The ratio of debt service
payments tc exports of goods and non-factor services was about 6 percent in
1973, and is not expected to vary much in the near future.
Development Policies and Prospects
11.       The three plans, 1966-1970, 1971 (interim), and 1972-76 undertaken
so far have generally been well conceived, well oriented documents taking a
realistic view of the country's meager resource base. As the First Plan,
the current Plan (1972-76) is essentially a set of sectoral projects, and
its target is very moderate, i.e., an annual real growth rate of GDP of 3.5
percent. The Plan correctly assigns highest priority to rural development
and in this sector, specific attention is paid to a program for the development
of the river valleys following the Riverblindness eradication campaign that
effectively started at the end of 1974. The Government also attaches high
priority to the exploitation of manganese deposits in the northern regions,
an undertaking that would require construction of a rail link of 350 Km.
between Ouagadougou and the prospective mine at Tambao. For the first two
years of the Plan, 1972 and 1973, financing commitments reached almost 100
percent of targets, while projects execution met about three-fourths of the
objective, which should be considered as a relatively good performance. Ex-
ternal financing of capital expenditure has apparently not been the major
obstacle in carrying out the Plan so far; on the other hand, lack of operat-
ing funds, limited administration capacity, inadequate preparation of pro-
jects, and most recently adverse external factors as diverse as drought,
world inflation, and delays in deliveries of material and equipment from
overseas, are very real obstacles to the smooth execution of projects.
12.       Foreign capital and technical assistance will continue to play a
decisive role in the development of Upper Volta. The economic mission's
estimates show that a moderate increase in the real value of foreign aid,
relative to the 1972 level, should occur over the next six years (1975-1980),
and that this should be sufficient to meet the costs of economic expansion
at a rate -- about 2 percent per annum of GDP growth per capita in real
terms -- which is considered consistent with the country's absorptive capacity
in the medium run. However, if this aid is to be truly effective, there will
be need for better coordination within the Government and for some relaxation
of present budgetary limits over development expenditures. On the other hand,
foreign aid should continue to be provided on concessionary terms, in view
of the present level of poverty of the country and its limited growth poten-
tial. External debt service at present absorbs about 6 percent of Upper
Volta's export earnings, and although this figure is fairly low in absolute
terms, it is high in relation to the country's very limited savings capacity.
Although Upper Volta should be expected to make a more significant contribu-
tion to the financing of public investment, this will necessarily remain
modest, and external lending agencies must continue to finance a high pro-
portion of total costs, including local costs of development projects.

PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       To date the Bank Group's contribution to Upper Volta's development
has consisted of seven IDA projects totaling $30.7 million on which a little
over US$7.25 million has so far been disbursed (Annex II). The first tele-
communications project, for which a credit of US$0.8 million was made in
1969, was completed in September of 1974. The West Volta Cotton project,
for which a credit of US$6.2 million was made in 1970, has not proceeded as
well as planned mainly because of drought conditions which led farmers to
favor food crops over cotton growing. Linked with this was a credit of
US$2.8 million approved in 1972 for upgrading to gravelled surface two roads
in the project area; an increase of US$1.35 million in the amount of this
credit was approved by the Executive Directors in March 1974 to take into
account increases in project cost due to currency realignments and to cost
overruns on the road construction component. The rural development fund
project, for which a credit of US$2.2 million was approved in 1972, is now
making some progress after a slow start resulting from delays over project
prefinancing and staff appointments; a similar project for Drought Relief
(US$2.0 million) was approved in December of 1972. Further credits of
US$2.85 million for an education project and US$4.5 million for a second
telecommunications project were approved in June 1973, and the projects are
now getting underway. Finally the Bougouriba rural development project
(US$8 million credit approved in June 1974) has been delayed by difficulties
in recruiting expatriate staff, but these are being overcome, and the project
should be started satisfactorily in the near future.
14.       The Bank Group's strategy in Upper Volta is dictated by the extreme
poverty of the country and the need to raise productivity in agriculture and
livestock on which the bulk of the population depend for a livelihood. Some
basic infrastructure is required for the operation of the economy, and the
IDA projects for telecommunications, and road construction and road better-
ment are designed to help in providing this. For the rest, IDA lending is
directed primarily to projects in agriculture, education and rural village
improvements with special emphasis on operations which will favor movements
of people away from the overpopulated central plateau with poor soils to
the southwest where ecological conditions are much better. Within this
broad strategy, the campaign for the control of riverblindness in the Volta
River Basin, for which the Bank has been mobilizing the necessary external
financing, should open up new opportunities for investment in land settlement
and agricultural development, and the Bank Group stands ready to assist in
the identification, preparation and eventual financing of suitable projects
in this field. Meanwhile, a special unit has been created with the assist-
ance of the French Government to prepare schemes for the development of some
of the river valleys.



15.        In addition to the proposed project, a number of projects are under
consideration for IDA financing. A feeder road project has been appraised and
is scheduled for presentation to the Board in July 1975. Consultants are
currently preparing and evaluating the West Volta Cotton Project with a view
to the preparation of a follow-up project which, would probably take the form
of an integrated rural development project. A second Rural Development Fund
operation and additional highway financing based on studies carried out under
the earlier project (Credit 316 UV) are further possibilities for the next
two years.
PART III: LIVESTOCK SECTOR
General
16.       The livestock population represents a major national resource in
Upper Volta and is estimated at about 2.5 million cattle, about 4 million
sheep and goats, 200,000 donkeys, 60,000 horses, 5,000 camels and about
150,000 pigs; poultry numbers are about 10 million. Historically, the
national herd has grown by about 2 percent annually, however, due to drought
it has decreased since 1967. About 275,000 head of cattle are sold or
slaughtered annually, a total offtake of about 11 percent, but only about
6.6 percent (165,000 head) pass through public markets and slaughterhouses.
17.       In recent years, livestock's share of GDP has amounted to about
11%. Total meat production is estimated at 54,000 tons, including 28,000
tons from cattle. Milk production for human consumption -- from cattle,
sheep and goats -- is estimated at 100 million liters. In 1972, livestock
exports (US$10.9 million), mainly live animals, accounted for about 25 per-
cent of livestock production and 50 percent of all recorded exports. The
main customers are Ivory Coast and Ghana, though exports to the latter have
decreased considerably due to import and currency restrictions.
The Traditional Producer
18.       About 70 percent of Upper Volta cattle are owned by Peulh pastor-
alists who constitute about 6 percent of the population. The remaining 30
percent is owned by crop farmers who entrust the management and herding of a
large portion of their cattle to the Peulh who receive payment in kind, usu-
ally milk. About three-quarters of the Peulh live outside the Sahel. They
are generally settled in one location or practice limited thanshumance. In
the dry season, those that live in the Sahel move their cattle out to the
Sudanian and Guinean zones where grazing and water are relativelv abundant,
and return to the Sahel at the beginning of the wet season. The average herd
size is 70 head and 30 smallstock for Peulh herds and about five head and
10 smallstock for the crop farmers' herd. Herds are grazed by day on communal
land and confined to thorn enclosures by night.



19.       Traditional production coefficients are low:    only about 50 percent
of calves born reach maturity and are used for breeding or sold for slaughter.
Milk yields are 150 kg/lactation. It takes 4-8 years for a steer to attain
a slaughter weight of 300-350 kg. The annual production of a typical Peulh
cattle herd is estimated at US$1,260, or 21 percent of the herd value
(US$6,000). Per capita income of Peulh pastoralists is estimated at US$109,
including US$24 worth of milk consumption; crop farmers derive about US$5 per
capita from livestock in addition to the US$36 per capita earned from crops.
Animal Health
20.       Rinderpest and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) have been
contained reasonably well as a consequence of an immunization campaign in
1964-67, financed by FED and USAID. They remain a constant threat, however,
until a more comprehensive vaccination service is provided. Anthrax and
blackleg are widespread because of inadequate vaccination. Trypanosomiasis
occurs in the Guinean and Southern part of the Sudanian zones. The prevailing
challenge of the tsetse fly, the vector for transmitting this disease, can be
controlled by prophylactic or curative treatment which is becoming increasingly
popular among the livestock owners. However, in the dense bush areas of the
South, the heavy tsetse challenge allows cattle production only with trypano-
tolerant breeds. Internal parasites are prevalent, and few control measures
are taken. All the diseases responsible for high mortality and low calving
rates are controllable by modern techniques, but the veterinary vaccination
service reaches only about 40 percent of the cattle population because of
inadequate facilities, staffing and funding. Thus the proposed project
would place considerable emphasis on vaccination services.
Livestock Marketing and Meat Processing
21.       Livestock marketing is a complex traditional system and subject to
limited government control. The system, although reasonably adequate, needs
improvements to cater for projected increases in output. Livestock producers
sell surplus stock either directly or through 40 secondary and 20 principal
markets to traders or their agents; these middlemen then move the animals on
foot to consumption ceaters or, in the case of live animal exports to Abidjan,
use the railroad. A few traders export carcass meat from Bobo-Dioulasso
using refrigerated railway trucks. Large slaughterhouses exist in Ouagadougou
and Bobo-Dioulasso, and together handle about 40,000 cattle and 53,000 sheep
and goats per year. Slaughter slabs with simple facilities are normally
found in communities with more than 2,000 people. Meat retailing is handled
by private butchers, without cooling facilities, and meat is sold on the day
of slaughter. SVCP (Societe Voltaique des Cuirs et Peaux), a parastatal
company, is the principal buyer and exporter of hides and skins.



-8-
Taxation
22.       Presently Government levies a tax of CFAF 200 per head on adult
cattle. Marketing and slaughter taxes vary from place to place. In the
Bobo-Dioulasso region, the charge per head is CFAF 100 for marketing and
CFAF 200 for slaughtering. Export taxes amount to CFAF 1,600 per head of
live cattle. Although export taxes are unpopular, and probably less than
half are collected, they constitute the only proven way of collecting revenue
from livestock. They account for about 4 percent of public revenue.
Government Services
23.       The Department of Livestock and Animal Industry of the Ministry of
Plan is concerned with livestock development policy and services such as
animal health, livestock marketing, meat inspection and animal production.
24.       At the local level responsibility for administration of these ser-
vices is vested in Regional Development Agencies (Organismes Regionaux de
Developpement -- ORDs) which were first created in 1965 as fully independent
entities to promote rural development in their areas but within the frame-
work of an integrated national rural development policy. Eleven ORDs cover
the country. Of these three are entirely financed by the Government, while the
investment and operating expenses of the others are largely financed by FAC,
FED, USAID and IDA (Bougouriba). The majority of ORDs employ foreign devel-
opment companies as management agents. Each ORD is administered by its own
Board of Directors comprising appointed government officials and representa-
tives of local authorities and farmers. Government is represented by a
"Commissaire du Gouvernement" who exercises considerable controlling powers.
ORDs are, in particular, responsible for providing agricultural extension,
training, credit and crop marketing services, and rural infrastructure (roads,
wells, warehouses, training centers, dams) in collaboration with and under
the supervision of the Ministry of Plan's Agriculture's Division of Water
Development and Rural Engineering (HAER). Effective January 1975, veterinary
field services have been transferred to the ORDs.
Utilization of Pastoral Resources
25.       Approximately 80 percent of Upper Volta's land resources are avail-
able for livestock grazing. Under the present traditional system involving
uncontrolled burning and minimal herd management, this resource is grossly
underutilized. Pasture based livestock production can be increased several
fold because, unlike most of West Africa's Sahelian countries, 85 percent of
Upper Volta lies outside the Sahelian zone and has average rainfall which
favors pasture production. For the large and favorably endowed pastures of
the Sudanian and Guinean zones, the carrying capacity under traditional
management is about 7-8 hectare per animal unit (ha/AU) versus present
stocking rates of about 10-14 ha/AU.    With improved grazing management and
controlled burning, the carrying capacity can be doubled to about 4 ha/AU.
By planting the subtropical legume stylosanthes (stylo), the carrying capacity
can be increased to about six times the present level.
26.       The principal



- 9 -
26.       The principal problem facing the development of the pastoral re-
source is to find a way to overcome the major constraints associated with
the prevailing system of utilization. Even though under the present land
tenure system all land is owned by Government and usufructuary rights are
given to individuals, the crop farmers are the traditional owners of all land
and in practice still regard themselves as such. Thus, although the law ex-
tends to pastoralists equal rights to communal grazing land, village leaders
who allocate usufructuary rights to land also decide which areas will be
utilized for cropping and which for grazing. As the Peulh pastoralists are
"foreigners" in these areas, the tendency is for them to be at the mercy of
the agriculturalists. More serious, land use conflicts are becoming more
prevalent in areas where population pressure is heavy and increasing the de-
mand for crop land. Although difficulty arises from the fact that livestock
are individually owned, there is no incentive for the individual to improve
the communally used grazing resource. Clearly there is a need to develop
group structures that will enable traditional producers to invest and reap
the benefits of modern ranching technology. Ranching structures developed
must therefore (a) provide security of land tenure in traditional producers;
(b) restrict livestock numbers to the carrying capacity of the land; (c)
enable producers to continue obtaining milk for subsistance while concurrently
increasing cash sales; (d) enable traditional producers to borrow and repay
development loans; and (e) ensure good ranch and rangeland management which
is the key to profitability. Government fully supports the development of
such ranching structures.
Livestock Development Strategy
27.       The basic objective of the Government's development strategy is
to increase the productivity of the livestock and pasture resources. These
resources are among the country's most valuable assets, and at present con-
tribute US$42 million to GDP (11 percent). Rough estimates indicate that
current levels of production could be increased by six times, offering pros-
pects for substantially increased incomes and exports. Government proposes
to achieve this through: (a) providing improved vaccination services; (b)
helping traditional producers to adopt modern livestock production methods;
and (c) providing improved livestock marketing and meat processing services.
The proposed project would pursue these objectives in an area comprising
over one-fifth of the country.
28.       A livestock development strategy in Upper Volta must be formulated
in the context of a sound overall agricultural development policy. This is
important because in the Sudano Guinean climatic zones (most of the country)
both crop and livestock can be produced and thus compete for the use of land;
under such conditions livestock have a residual claim on land. This is so
because cropping is the most intensive form of production and results in more
human food per unit of land. Thus, there is a distinct danger that in the
long term the livestock industry may be relegated to insignificant propor-
tions unless the cropping sector can be made to evolve from the present



- 10 -
wasteful system of shifting cultivation to one based on crop rotation and
ultimately mixed crop - livestock farming. The group ranch components of
the project involving the simultaneous development of traditional group
farming and animal husbandry would be an attempt to implement this strategy.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
29.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Livestock Development Project"
(No. 674a-UV) is being circulated separately. A credit and project summary,
including a breakdown of costs, is contained in Annex III, and the project
area is shown on the attached map (IBRD 11456). The Regional Mission in
Western Africa (RMWA) identified the project in June 1971, and subsequently
prepared it with the help of studies carried out by SCET (a French consulting
firm) financed by the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC). A field appraisal
took place in October - November 1974, and negotiations were held in Washington
from April 21 through April 29. The Voltaic delegation was led by the Secret-
ary of State for the Plan, M. Leonard Kalmogo.
The Project Area
30.       The project area would consist of the Dedougou and Bob? -Dioulasso
Development Agencies (ORD's) covering an area of about 58,000 km in the
Sudanian and Guinean climatic zones. The population in the area is about
0.9 million people of whom about 93 percent are cultivators and the remain-
der are Peulh pastoralists. In the 300,000 ha group ranch development
sub-project area surrounding the village of Samorogouan, 84 percent of the
about 20,000 people are croppers and 16 percent are Peulh pastoralists.
The project area carries about 20 percent of the country's cattle (490,000
head) and about 20 percent of the sheep and goats (750,000 head). The
Samorogouan subproject area carries about 23,000 cattle and 8,000 sheep and
goats. Only about 8 percent of the project area and 3 percent of the
Samorogouan subproject area is being cultivated, and allowing for crop fal-
lows, over 80 percent of the land is available for livestock production on
pasture.
Project Description
31.       The project would be a broadly based program to assist cattle
production in Dedougou and Bobo-Dioulasso Regional Development Agencies
(Organisme Regional de Developpement - ORDs) through ranch development and
the improvement of livestock marketing, meat processing and veterinary
services. It would help about 300,000 traditional cattle produce-s and, in
addition, would introduce commercial ranching to the traditional sector.
The project, carried out over five years, 1976-80, would comprise:



- 11 -
(a) establishing nine group ranches and a ranch development center;
(b) providing improved veterinary services throughout Dedougou and
Bobo-Dioulasso ORDs;
(c) constructing a livestock market and holding ground at Bobo-
Dioulasso as well as improving 730 km of stock routes;
(d) renovating a slaughterhouse at Bobo-Dioulasso; and
(e) providing for training, field trials, project evaluation and
monitoring, and future project preparation.
Project Execution
32.       The core of the project consists of the formation of nine group
ranches, responsibility for which will be vested in the Bobo-Dioulasso ORD.
To implement the Group Ranch component of the project the ORD will establish,
as a separate division, a livestock development center which will be run by
an expatriate manager to be recruited. The Project is also designed to provide
improved veterinary services to livestock owners in the area covered by the
two ORDs of Bobo-Dioulasso and Dedougou. Here again it is the ORD which will
be primarily responsible through its existing veterinary services, for supply-
ing the services in question. Both ORDs are going concerns with Voltaic
General Managers. It is one of the Bank's objectives to build the ORDs up
as Government agencies primarily responsible for the execution of rural devel-
opment schemes in Upper Volta. The third component of the project is concerned
with improving livestock marketing and meat processing. This part would be
implemented by the Project Unit (PU) on behalf of ONERA, an autonomous agency
responsible to the Minister of Plan which would operate these facilities.
33.       To coordinate the various components of the project and to super-
vise its implementation, the Government would establish a Project Unit in
the Ministry of Plan with headquarters at Bobo-Dioulasso (section 3.02a of
the Credit Agreement). PU would have responsibilities for implementing the
livestock marketing arid MCAT processing components and for evaluating the
results achieved by the project now proposed and for the preparation of future
livestock projects. This unit would include a Project Director, an Assistant
Director (agricultural economist), a civil engineer through year 3, an account-
ant, and after year 3, a livestock specialist.
34.       The BND primarily a disbursing agent for this project, would be
the credit channel for livestock marketing, meat processing and group ranch
lending.
Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
35.       The project cost for the five-year period, net of taxes and import
duties but including contingencies is estimated at US$10.8 million. Taxes
account for an addi.tional USSO.7 million. It is proposed that an IDA Credit
of US$9 million be made to Government on standard terms, covering 83% of the
project costs excluding taxes and duties. The Credit would finance the project



- 12 -
foreign exchange costs (US$4.8 million) and US$4.2 million of local currency
costs. The remaining local costs would be met from Government's budgetary
allocations (US$1.3 million) and from the National Development Bank (Banque
National de Developpement-BND) (US$1.2 million).
36.       Funds for the veterinary service would be channelled as a grant to
the Dedougou and Bobo-Dioulasso ORDs. Funds for the Group Ranch Development
Center would be on-lent to the Bobo-Dioulasso ORD by Government without
interest, for a term of 20 years with a five-year grace period. Funds for
group ranches would be channelled through BTD to final beneficiaries at 10
percent annually, for a term of 13 years with a six-year grace period. Gov-
ernment would lend funds to BND at 5.5 percent annually, for a term of 18
years with a six-year grace period. The spread accruing to BND is sufficient
to cover administrative expenses and risks. Government would on-lend funds
for livestock marketing and meat processing to ONERA at 10 percent annually,
for a term of 15 years including a five-year grace period; ONERA would make
available funds required for the investment program to PU, which would
develop the facilities.   As part of the Ministry of Plan, PU would obtain funds
for its other operations and for technical services directly.
Procurement and Disbursements
37.       Vehicles and equipment (US$0.9 million) would be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines. Domes-
tically manufactured goods would be allowed a preference of 15 percent (or
the level of applicable import duty whichever is lower). Contracts for (a)
building and construction (US$1.7 million), (b) the installation of 88 wells
along stock routes and for ranch development (US$0.7 million), and (c) the
rehabilitation of the Bobo-Dioulasso slaughterhouse (US$0.1 million), in-
cluding construction works and the purchase of equipment, involve numerous
operations scattered over the project area and, phased over three years,
would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and
in accordance with local procedures which are acceptable to IDA. These con-
tracts are not large enough to make international tendering appropriate.
Draft tender documents for all contracts exceeding US$100,000 would be sub-
mitted to IDA for approval before invitations were issued. A major part of
project costs (US$3.5 million) would be for cattle purchase, on-farm devel-
opments, purchase of seeds and vaccines, staff salaries and operating costs;
none of these would be suitable for competitive bidding. The services of
expatriate staff and consultants (US$1.0 million) would be obtained accord-
ing to procedures acceptable to IDA.
38.       The IDA Credit would be disbursed over five years to cover:
(a) 75 percent of total expenditures for civil works -- US$2.1 mil-
lion;



- 13 -
(b)  85 percent of total cost or 100 percent of foreign expenditure
(CIF) costs for vehicles and other equipment-- US$0.9 million;
(c)  60 percent of cattle purchases for group ranches and for the
Group Ranch Development Center -- US$1.1 million;
(d)  100 percent of foreign expenditures for expatriate personnel
and foreign training, and for consultants for the
Bobo-Dioulasso slaughterhouse -- US1.0 million;
(e)  75 percent of the incremental working capital and project
operating costs of group ranches, the Group Ranch Development
Center, and PU during the disbursement period, excluding cattle
purchases and foreign expenditures for personnel and train-
ing -- US$0.7 million; and
(f) 45 percent of the total operating costs of the veterinary services
component during the first three years -- US$0.3 million.
US$2.9 million would be unallocated.
Markets
39.       The market outlook for meat is very favorable in West Africa.    Meat
is increasingly scarce due to the recent drought, rapid population growth and
urbanization; the strength of demand is shown by rapidly rising prices. Since
the incremental production of the project at full development would not exceed
about 11 percent of current domestic output, it should find a ready market.
The hides and skins can easily be exported or bought by the state agency,
SVCP; the milk would improve the nutrition of rural families and any surplus
would find a ready local market.
40.       Livestock marketing in the country is reasonably efficient, and
the project would improve the marketing infrastructure in Dedougou and
Bobo-Dioulasso ORDs. Slaughtering facilities would be made adequate by the
reconstruction under this project of a slaughterhouse to cover the needs of
Bobo-Dioulasso, the only large town in the project area. 'Meat is retailed
by an adequate network of butcher stalls.
Benefits and Justification
41.       The direct benefits from the project would be incremental annual
livestock production worth CFAF 758 million (US$3.4 million) in 1974 terms,
yielding net foreign exchange earnings of the order of CFAF 359 million
(US$1.6 million). About 50,000 pastoralists, benefitting from the improved
veterinary service would increase their cash income from livestock produc-
tion from about US$85 to US$105 and about 3,000 participating in group
ranches would increase their cash incomes to about US$200. About 220,000
farmers benefitting from livestock production would increase their average



- 14 -
per capita cash income from US$5 to US$7 and about 14,000 farmers partici-
pating in group ranches would increase their cash incomes from livestock
to US$56 in addition to the US$36 they derive from crops.
42.       The economic rate of return of the project is estimated at 28
percent. Because of the high rate of return the project would absorb a
substantial amount of the risks which exist. The project would substantially
increase the productivity of the traditional herd (490,000): offtake would
be increased from about 11 percent to 13 percent and sales would be increased
by about 30 percent. The organization of traditional producers into group
ranches which tackles basic and sensitive development issues -- social, cul-
tural and land use, would be a pioneering venture for Upper Volta. The
institution-building, training and technical assistance aspects of this
component are of major significance and should provide guidelines for future
development. If successful they could set the stage for widespread develop-
ment of Upper Volta's vast pasture and livestock resources.
43.        The main risks of the project are found in the group ranch com-
ponent and are associated with the prevailing system of land utilization.
They revolve around the difficulty in assessing the degree to which crop
farmers will agree to give up their usufructuary rights over a portion of
the land in the Samorogouan area and join together with the pastoralists as
members of the group ranches and whether pastoralists would be willing to
form a joint operation with the crop farmers. Even though under the present
land tenure system all land is owned by Government and usufructuary rights
are given to individuals, the crop farmers are the traditional owners of all
land, and the chefs de terre, elected by the villagers, play a key role in
allocating land to crop farmers and pastoralists for temporary use. The
Peulh pastoralists who have lived in the area for 20 years, are still re-
garded as foreigners and are at the mercy of the chefs de terre for their
land allocation. In implementing the group ranch component the Samorogouan
Development Center would come to grips with the problems and uncertainty
which will surely exist by explaining and interpreting the nature of group
ranches as well as by helping to resolve conflicts and difficulties as they
arise. Furthermore, the potential benefits from participating which are
substantial, should constitute a strong incentive to cooperate with the cen-
ter. Funds for the group ranches are to be disbursed in phases and should
the concept of group ranches not take hold, disbursements would cease. If
this should happen, it would be most regrettable but it would not jeopardize
the remainder of the project. In sum, although the project does involve risks,
the potential benefits are so important relative to them that the risks are
worth taking.

PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.        The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association
and the Republic of Upper Volta, the recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Associa-
tion and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit,
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
45.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms to the normal
pattern for credits for livestock projects.
46.        I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOM24ENDATION
47.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit 225: West Volta Cotton Project. US$6.2 Million Credit of
December 30, 1970; Closing Date June 30, 1976
The project is in the final stage of a cotton production development
program in West Volta, which originally started with FAC financing in 1963.
It consists of both expansion of the area under cotton cultivation on some
46,000 farms and improvement of yields through credit and extension services,
and provision of better communications and processing facilities. The proj-
ect also includes funds for detailed engineering of secondary roads and prepara-
tion of the Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project.
Plagued by very poor weather conditions during the past three years
and a severe drought last year, seed cotton production in the project area
remained below expectations (about 20,000 t as against 50,000 t estimated in
the appraisal report) and the areas under cotton also remained stagnant.
Improved rainfall distribution in 1974/75 should increase yields to about
25,000 t.
Because of the low production, the existing ginneries in Bobo-
Dioulasso and Koudougou work at only 50 percent capacity, and therefore the
construction of an additional ginnery at Hounde, estimated in the appraisal
report at CFA 256 million, is for the time being not julstified. With
favorable weather conditions and improved prices, the project areas may
reach the 40,000 t production goal in 1978, at which point the present gin-
neries would have to work at full capacity.
Although the production goals as set out in the appraisal report
have not yet been reached, the project is having a favorable impact on the
rural population of the project area and therefore a follow-up rural develop-
ment project is being considered.
Credit 316:  Road Project.   US$4.15 Million Credit of June 26, 1972
(as amended on March 25, 1974); Closing Date December 31,
1975
Originally the project comprised (a) the reconstruction of the
Solenzo Koudougou (70 km) and the Hounde-Bereba (27 km) roads, and (b) fea-
sibility studies for about 400 km of primary roads, and engineering of those
sections found to have the highest priority.
The pre-selection of contractors for part (a) above took place in
November 1972. Four bids were received in 1973, the lowest being about 25
percent higher than the appraisal estimate. Construction of the Solenzo
Koudougou road began in March 1974. This road should be completed during
the first half of 1975. Construction of the Hounde-Bereba road is now deleted
from the project as cotton production does not merit the construction of the



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 6 pages
ginnery and without the ginnery there is no justification for the road. Gov-
ernment suggestions for alternative road projects will be considered during
the highway mission of April 1975.
Regarding (b) above, the Government proposed four roads tc be
studied and the Association agreed to only two, from Bobo-Dioulasso to Hounde
and Bobo-Dioulasso to Banfora (a total of about 190 km) as these were the
only roads considered likely to show a satisfactory rate of return. Feasi-
bility studies have been competed and detailed engineering is now underway.
Due to currency realignments and to cost overruns on the road
construction part of the project, the dollar cost of the project increased.
Consequently, to enable completion of the project, on March 25, 1974 the
Association approved an increase of US$1.35 million in the amount of the
Credit from US$2.8 million to US$4.15 million. It is expected that the proj-
ect will be completed and the credit fully disbursed by the present closing
date.
Credit 317: Rural Development Fund Project. US$2.2 Million Credit of
June 26, 1972; Closing Date September 30, 1976
Between 300,000 and 450,000 people are benefiting from the project.
The Rural Development Fund (RDF) Division has been established within the
Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND) to execute the project; it started
operating in September 1972. BND's performance and project management are
satisfactory. It has just completed its first annual program on the basis of
proposals made by the Organismes Regionaux de Developpement (ORD). The main
components of this program are dug and tube wells, village warehouses and
development of bottomlands. Execution of the project which started slowly
mainly due to delays over project prefinancing and staff appointments has
gained momentum during the 1973/74 season. Experience has shown that the
project concept is sound, in that financing small projects can have a direct
and beneficial effect on the poorest 40 percent who are willing to co-
operate fully in contributing their labor. It is also encouraging to see
how a fairly complex management set-up involving the expertise of various
governmental institutions (HEAR, PW, Agriculture and the ORD) can be used to
make a combined effort in rural development. A follow-up project, RDF II, is
presently under preparation.
Credit 430: Education Project. US$2.85 Million Credit of September 28,
1973; Closing Date June 30, 1978
The Credit was approved on June 21, 1973 and signed on September 28,
1973. It became effective on June 27, 1974.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 6 pages
The project consists of two parts:
Part A
Reconstruction and equipping of 40 rural education centers (CERs)
and equipping of 80 such centers; organization equipping and servicing of 150
cooperative groups (GPS) of former CER students as the pilot phase of a
scheme to create some 500 such groups; creation of three rural development
centers; related technical assistance for project implementation and evalua-
tion; a feasibility study of a system to train managers for rural development
projects.
Part B
Provision of science facilities for 21 secondary schools.
While progress on Part B of the project which is under the Ministry
of Education has been satisfactory, there have been no disbursements under
Part A. This is mainly the result of the weakness in project management. The
rural education part of the project is particularly complex because it involves
the coordination of two other donors, the FAC and the FED. In addition,
certain changes proved necessary in the concept of rural education: (a) the
linkage of the centers to specific rural development activities; (b) full
participation of the communities in the objectives of the centers.
The Project is under continuous supervision from the RMWA in
Abidjan and the Government, FAC, FED and the Bank are working to strengthen

Credit 431: Second Telecommunications Project. US$4.5 Million Credit of
September 28, 1973; Closing Date June 30, 1978
The Credit was approved on June 21, 1973 and signed on September
28, 1973. It became effective on May 23, 1974.
This credit, the second made to Upper Volta for telecommunications,
finances the major part of Upper Volta's 1974-77 telecommunications expansion
program. The project comprises provision of automatic and trunk switching
equipment, local distribution networks and subscribers' apparatus, microwave
links, auxillary construction and equipment, consultants services and training
of personnel. The executing agency for the project is the Office des Postes
et Telecommunications de Haute-Volta (OPT) an autonomous public entity.
The execution of the project has been progressing on schedule. All
major contracts were expected to be awarded by the end of 1974. It should be
completed by December 1977. As compared to appraisal forecasts, project costs
have increased only slightly on the project's local cost components, and the
IDA Credit is judged sufficient to cover the project's foreign exchange

requirements. The financial results for the year ending December 31, 1973
were satisfactory, though the actual rate of return was 8 percent compared to
the appraised rate of return of 10.4 percent. OPT financial outlook for the
years 74-77 is projected to deteriorate, however. OPT is aware of this, and
is currently-studying several financial policy alternatives.
Credit 442: Drought Relief Project. US$2.0 Million Credit of December 7,
1973; Closing Date June 30, 1976
The Credit was approved on November 13, 1973 and signed on December
7, 1973. It was declared effective on April 24, 1974.
This Credit is one of six credits made available to the six Sahelian
countries to help people in drought-affected areas to re-establish their
self-sufficiency through redevelopment and improvement of their farms and
herds. The project is being executed by the Rural Development Fund Division
which was established within the Banque Nationale de Developpement to execute
the on-going IDA-financed Rural Development Fund Project.
The project consists of four sub-projects; (i) construction and
equipment of 150 wells; (ii) construction of three earth dams; (iii) purchase
of road equipment for repair of feeder roads; (iv) construction of six seed
storage warehouses. The Project area is that part of Northern Upper Volta
affected by the drought.
The procurement phase is completed and the execution of the tube-
well drilling program, the most important component of the project, is being
prepared. It is anticipated that only one of the originally planned three
dams will be constructed due to price increases in the other sub-projects.
Management has the project well in hand, and it is expected that the various
sub-projects will be executed on time.
Credit 496: Bougouriba Agricultural Development. US$8.0 Million
Credit of July 19, 1974; Closing Date May 31, 1979
The Credit was approved on May 30, 1974 and signed on July 19,
1974. The Credit is not yet effective and no disbursements have taken place.
Delays have been due primarily to problems in recruiting key staff. However,
the Project Director has been appointed and preparatory work is proceeding,
and the credit should become effective very shortly.

UPPER VOLTA - LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:                 Republic of Upper Volta.
Amount:                   US$9.0 million equivalent.
Terms:                    Standard.
Project-Description:      The project would be a broadly based program to
assist cattle production in the Dedougou and Bobo-
Dioulasso Regional Development Agencies (Organisme
Regional de Developpement-ORDs) through group ranch
development, the improvement of veterinary services,
livestock marketing, meat processing and the pro-
vision of technical assistance. It would help about
300,000 traditional cattle producers and, in addi-
tion would introduce commercial ranching to the
traditional sector.
The project, carried out over five years, 1976-80,
would comprise:
(a) establishing nine group ranches and a group
ranch development center;
(b) providing improved veterinary services through-
out Dedougou and Bobo-Dioulasso ORD regions;
(c) constructing a livestock market and holding
ground at Bobo-Dioulasso as well as improving
730 km of stock routes;
(d) renovating a slaughterhouse at Bobo-Dioulasso;
and
(e) providing for training, field trials, project
evaluation and monitoring, and future project
preparation.
Benefits and
Justification:          The direct benefits from the project would be incre-
mental annual livestock production worth CFAF 758
million (US$3.4 million) in 1974 terms, yielding net



ANNEX III
Page 2 of 4 pages
foreign exchange earnings of the order of CFAF 359
million (US$1.6 million). About 50,000 pastoralists
benefiting from the improved veterinary service would
increase their average per capita cash incomes from
livestock production from about US$85 to US$105 and
about 3,000 participating in group ranches would
increase their cash incomes to about US$200. About
220,000 farmers benefiting from livestock production
would increase their average per capita cash income
from US$5 to US$7 and about 14,000 farmers partici-
pating in group ranches would increase their cash
incomes from livestock to US$56 in addition to the
US $36 they derive from crops.
Estimated Cost:           The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$11.5 million, or US$10.8 million net of taxes
and duties, with an estimated foreign exchange
component of US$4.8 million. The breakdown of the
total project cost would be as follows:

Procurement
Arrangements:           Vehicles and equipment (US$0.9 million) would be
procured through international competitive bidding
in accordance with IDA guidelines. Domestically
manufactured goods would be allowed a preference of
15 percent (or the level of applicable import duty,
whichever is lower). Contracts for (a) building and
construction (US$1.7 million), (b) the installation
of 88 wells along stock routes and for ranch devel-
opemnt (US$0.7 million), and (c) the renovation
of the Bobo-Dioulasso slaughterhouse (US$0.1 million),
including construction works and the purchase of
equipment, involve numerous operations scattered
over the project area and, phased over three years,
would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally and in accordance with local
procedures which are acceptable to IDA. These con-
tracts are not large enough to make international
tendering appropriate. Draft tender documents for
all contracts exceeding US$100,000 would be sub-
mitted to IDA for approval before invitations were
issued. A major part of project costs (US$3.5 mil-
lion) would be for cattle purchase, on farm devel-
opments, purchase of seeds and vaccines, staff
salaries and operating costs; none of these would
be suitable for competitive bidding. The services
of expatriate staff and consultants (US$1.0 million)
would be obtained according to procedures acceptable
to IDA.
Staffing:                 As it is unlikely that qualified and experienced
Voltaics would be available to fill the posts of
Assistant Director (Agricultural Economist), Civil

Engineer, Accountant and Livestock Specialist in
the Project Unit and the post of the Group Ranch
Development Center Manager, Government, during
negotiations, asked that these positions be filled
from abroad. Individuals recruited from abroad
would have counterparts who would replace them
after project year 5. In addition 38 man months of
consulting services are provided to (a) prepare
future livestock projects with emphasis on small
holder fattening and milk production, (b) monitor
and evaluate the project, (c) carry out pedological
and sociological studies in the Group Rangh Devel-
opment area and (d) perform consultant engineering
for the renovation of the Bobo-Dioulasso slaughter-
house.
Economic Rate
of Return:              28%.  (See Annex 12 of Appraisal Report).
