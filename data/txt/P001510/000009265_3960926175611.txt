MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR A SEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Republic of Madagascar for SDR 28.9
million (US$40.0 million) is submitted for approval. The proposed Credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help
finance transport development in Madagascar. The project would be
cofinanced from the African Development Fund (AfDF) credit of UCF 20.0
million (US$ 25.0 million), the European Development Fund (EDF) grant of
ECU 25.5 (US$32.6 million), the Norwegian Aid (NORAD) grant of Nkr 16.0
million (US$2.7 million), and the Swiss Development Cooperation and
Humanitarian Aid (SDC) grant of about SF 25.0 million (US$15.6 million).
The Association would administer SFR 15.0 million of the SDC SFR 25.0
million grant while the other SFR 10.0 million will be administered on a
bilateral basis.
3ackground
2.        Transport is one of the most important sectors in the economy of
Madagascar, with the road sub-sector playing a vital role in the movement
of freight (about 50X) and interurban passengers (about 65?). The island'e
rugged terrain and tropical climate make the transport system costly to
build and difficult to maintain. After manN years of neglect, transport
infrastructure had badly deteriorated by the early 19809, causing high
costs, largely in foreign exchange, thus inhibiting the movement of coffee
and other export crops and domestic consumption staples, like rice.
Large-scale nationalization, and cumbersome regulations contributed to
lower agricultural production and to depressed exports. Misallocations of
resources. lack of coordination among entities, and poor management also
plagued the transport sector.
3.        In the 1980s, to support the country's development program, IDA's
and other donors' lending shifted to the roads, railways and ports
sub-sectors. The programs, focusing on rehabilitation and policy reforms,
have overall improved infrastructure considerably, and restored financial
viability to the railways and the national air carrier. Institution
building and policy formulation have also been strengthened through new
institutions such as a new Planning Directorate in the Ministry of
Transport, Meteorology and Tourism (MTMT) and new planning instruments like
the National Transport Plan. The Government is carrying out a program of
structural adjustment aimed at greater liberalization and reliance on the
private sector. In this context the liberalization of freight has been
carried out, but not that of passenger transport.
4.        Although main roads have improved, serious constraints remain,
such as the deteriorating feeder road network, the centralized organization
of the Ministry of Public Works (MTP), and the lack of consistent road
maintenance. Many factors have contributed to deficient road maintenance
and in particular: (i) inadequate financial allocations to the Road Fund,
established under IDA's Sixth Highway Project (Cr. 1391/SF4-MAG), from
central government's budget and not as stipulated, by fuel tax receipts
through the national oil company, SOLIMA; (ii) sporadic maintenance



-2-
operations directed centrally by MTP which lacks management capacity;
(iii) multiple management responsibilities of the road aetwork by other
public and private agencies, such as Faritany (jrovinces) and Office du
Developpement Rizicole (ODR) with resulting inefficiencies and ambiguity of
accountability; (iv) delayed progress in rehabilitation works under the
Sixth Highway Project caused by arrears in payments to contractors,
consultants and suppliers; and (v) lack of enforcement of traffic
regulations and safety which has resulted in accelerated deterioration and
high accident fatalities.
Proiect Obiectives
5.        The project aims at: (i) strengthening MTP's capacity, especially
in policy formulation, planning, budgeting, and supervision; (ii) facili-
tating agricultural development, thus promoting food security and exports
of agricultural products; (iii) gradually shifting most maintenance
operstions from force account to private contractors who are already active
in the sector; (iv) developing local human resources and the domestic
construction industry; {v) improving public expenditure practices- in the
road sub-sector through a three-year rolling Public Expenditure Program
(PEP) based on a current National Transport Plan; (vi) improving road
safety and enforcing traffic regulations; and (vii) ensuring optimal use
of donors' assistAnce through financing of high priority works.
Project Description
6.        At appraisal a four-year program (1988-1991) for road
rehabilitation and maintenance, and institution building was designed to
meet the high priority transport needs of the country. The cost of the
program was estimated at'US$197.0 million equivalent 1/.  With pledges
made by donors during a meeting held in the ,Bank offices in Paris on
January 27, 1988, a project consisting of critical elements of the program
has been designed; it is estimated to cost US$144.1 million. The project
presented below is self-contained; it is designed so that as additional
financing becomes available, the elements can be easily expanded.
7.        The proposed Seventh Highway Program is within the scope of
Government's National Transport Plan and conforms to Government's
macro-economic development strategy. The program's objectives will be
optimally achieved by: (i) rehabilitating-end maintaining the main roads
and priority feeder roads; (ii) restructuring and strengthening the role of
MTP by (a) entrusting it with planning, coordination and monitoring of
works including those carried out by other entities; <b) decentralizing
MTP's functions by shifting the management of road operations to MTP's
11   Costs are net of taxes which are estimated at US$29.5 million and
US$21.6 million equivalent respectively for the program and the
project.

regional heads; (c) contracting out road maintenance works; (d) developing
the local construction industry by upgrading contractors' skills through
training at MITP's Centre d'Applications des Travaux Publics (CATP) and
solving their liquidity problem through contractual arrangement providing
quick upfront payments and ensuring regular payments through the Road Fund;
(e) strengthening the professional caliber of civil works personnel by
upgrading CATP to the rank of institut so that its diplomas and
certificates are valid for promotion of its graduates in the public and
private sectors; (iii) providing the Ministry of Defense (MOD), charged
with enforcing traffic regulations and road safety requirements to minimize
road deterioration and accident fatalities, with the legal instruments to
do so; and (iv) providing consultants' services to assist in project
implementation.
Rationale for IDA's Involvement
8.        IDA's suppor' of Government's Seventh Highway Program is
justified on the following grounds: (i) assistance to Government to achieve
food security through the development of priority feeder roads;
(ii) consolidation and continuation of transport sector improvements
initiated under previously financed IDA projects; (iii) support to
Government's policy reforms aimed at restoring vital infrastructure and
mobilizing more effectively domestic and external resources; and (iv)
leadership in the coordination of external support to a program which the
international community is willing -to finance.
Actions Agreed
9.        The Government has published a decree decentralizing road
maintenance to regional road authorities and a decree ensuring reliable
funding of the Road Fund by SOLIMA and a flexible disbursement mechanism
for timely road maintenance. The Government has also liquidated arrears of
payments accumulated under the Sixth Highway Project. Issues agreed upon
with the Government during negotiations and incorporated as covenants in
the Credit Agreement include: (i) updating the National Transport Plan and
annually preparing a three-year PEP, for IDA's approval, to improve
allocations of resources and promote a rational choice of investments;
(ii) agreeing on a yearly level of SDR 3.6 million financing for road
maintenance and the mechanisms to ensure its timely provision through the
Road Fund; (iii) reviewing regulations for passenger traffic and
implementing further liberalization if necessary; and Civ) requiring firms
sending participants to courses at CATP to pay fees equivalent to the
average cost per trainee for salaries of local teachers and consumable
goods. Conditions of credit effectiveness would entail publishing legal
instruments: Ci) coordinating all road activities and initiating charging
local users the cost of maintaining feeder roads; (ii) upgrading CATP to
the status of an institut and empowering it to issue valid training
certificates and diplomas; and (iii) establishing adequaL2 standards for
implementation of traffic regulations and road safety measures.

Benefits
10.       The project would support the country's policy reform aimed at
economic development by: (i) rehabilitating and maintaining an economic
road network which carries about 902 of the traffic, traverses the most
populous regions of the country and links all major centers of economic
activity, and (ii) rehabilitating the vital feeder road network which would
support exports of agricultural products and promote food security, thus
alleviating poverty in the rural areas. The promotion of small- and.
medium-scale domestic contractors, who will carry out labor intensive road
maintenance operations, would provide employment to the rural poor.
Risks
11.       The main risks associated with the project arise from the
possible shortage of local counterpart funds for the maintenance component
and from MTP's capability to manage and execute force account works. These
risks should be mitigated by the use of the Road Fund which ensures
adequate, timely and easily accessible funds for road maintenance, by using
contractors to carry out most of the civil works and through the technical
assistance provided.
Recommendation
12.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
