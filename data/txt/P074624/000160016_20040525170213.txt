Environmental Audits of the Thermal Power Plants and Power Co-generating Units:
Preliminary Hydrogeological Investigations at Mwanza Nyakato PowerStation
1. INTRODUCTION
This work is a part component of the Environmental Audits of the Thermal Power Plant
and Power Co-generating Units Projects that are currently on the discussion table
between the World Bank and TANESCO. There are three options that are being
considered for implementation for assisting TANESCO to meet its emergency power
generation needs due to poor hydrological conditions in its critical catchments areas.
Details on the 3 options in subject are found in the Draft Terms of Reference for
Environmental Audits of Thermal Power Plant and Power Co-generating Units hereby
appended (Appendix 01) for the reader to refer to.
The option that is being worked on is the one that includes 18x 1 Mw plant to be leased
from the Geita Gold mines to be installed at TANESCO'exisitng generations site at
Nyakato, Mwanza.   See Appendix 02 for the specifications of the machines and
Additional notes on the rudimentary financial analysis by the author of this report.
2. SCOPE OF WORK
This part of the work is to assist and guide the environmental audit for the Mwanza
Nyakato PowerStation. The geological work was commissioned to TANESCO
Engineering Geologist, Eng. Leonard Kassana for making preliminary assessment of
the hydro-geological conditions of the area within the following scope:
2.2. Preliminary assessment of water table in the area
2.3. Preliminary assessment of the geological formational lithology within the site
2.4. Tentative location of boreholes that are meant for monitoring pollution of ground
water by water and oil effluents from both existing and planned thermal
generating units
2.5. Possible direction of the groundwater in the area
2.6. Establish tentative costs for boreholes to be drilled at the site.
3. INVESTIGATIONS
The following methods of investigations were applied during the course of this short
study:
3.2. Interpretation of topographical maps at 1:50,000 and 1:2,500
3.3. Geological map at 1: 100,000
3.4. Light Static and Dynamic Sounding (LSD) as pilot hole for hand augering
3.5. Hand auger to assess lithology and ground water table
3.6. Survey and interview local professionals around the site regarding
hydrogeological conditions.
4. RESULTS
4.1. Site Geology: The site lies within Greenstone belt of Tanzania whose age is
within Precambrian age. The site lies about 7 km along Mwanza - Musoma road.
The area is underlain by Granite and due to the preliminary nature of this study,
the author of this report is not able to differentiate the granitic rock. The average
bedrock level at the site varies between 1.6 m and 2.0 m as preliminarily
determined by Light Static and Dynamic Sounding method (see Appendix 00).

Environmental Audits of the Thermal Power Plants and Power Co-generating Units:
Preliminary Hydrogeological Investigations at Mwanza Nyakato PowerStation
In the yard, there are few granitic outcrops scattered, protruding above the
surface. Spherical weathering is much dominant in the area making vertical and
lateral jointing system to be very important. For more information on regional
geology, the reader is referred to the provisional publication of the quarter degree
sheet (QDS) #33 of Mwanza by Geological Survey of Tanzania, 2002.
The site is covered by the soil derived from granitic rock whose thickness varies
between 1.6 m and 2.0 m. The hand augured samples have the following
characteristics:
Table 1: Preliminary Lithology at Nyakato PowerStation area
Depth in m      Description                  Remarks
0.0 - 0.2       Brown, loose, Silty SAND
0.2 - 0.6       Grayish Brown Sandy SILT
0.6 - 0.8       Grey fine Sandy SILT
0.8- 1.6        Reddish Brown Clayey Sandy  This   is  equivalent  of
SILT with occasional gravels  weathering grade IV
NB: Groundwater in the hand auger hole is Dry.
For visual view, the reader is kindly referred to the photos in Appendix 04.
4.2. Hydrogeology of the site: Preliminary investigations during this period show
that hydrogeology of the site is much controlled by underlying the granitic
environment. The underlying rock is shallow seated ranging from 1.6 to 2.0 m
depth. The underground drainage is controlled by rock mass jointing system. The
rock mass is dominated by vertical and lateral jointings due to special type of
weathering known as spherical weathering. Soil mass is derived from granite and
the nature of the soil is much sandy hinting that soil permeability may be
moderate to high.
Findings from the light and shallow sounding and borings done during this short
study show that water table are deeper than 2 m. The groundwater measurements
in 3 LSD holes using water dipper showed that all of them are dry down to 2 m.
This exercise took place in the month of March 2004 toward the end of dry
season. According to the Civil Engineer, Tanesco Mwanza, Mr. Nnunduma, the
water table was struck at 3 m in the soak pit dug at about 100 m south east of the
LSD2/HA1 for the substation staff houses.
The bedrock is very shallowly inclined, dipping between south east to east hence
somehow governing the general flow direction.
More hydrogeological parameters must be investigated in the future to determine
absolute permeability of the soil mass and rock mass. Insitu permeability tests
have to be done in the boreholes that will be drilled at site. Water table will also
be confirmed during this future exercise.

4.3. Observation BHs:
Based on site conditions, two boreholes (BHs) are proposed to be drilled at two
tentative locations in the order of 200 m apart, see the site map on Appendix 03.
One BH will be located at location behind the old power house but downstream of
the Oil interceptor pit. The reason for this proposed BH:
* To monitor ground water pollution 'which I think has been caused by
discharge of oil due to the collapse of the pit. This happened at the time of
our stay.
* Oil spillage around the oil interceptor has been significant and it is
therefore recommended to monitor the pollution in the ground water.
The second BH will be at a location considered suitable enough to intercept the
flow of the ground water of any effluents from the would be new installations.
The preliminary costs for borehole drillings are based on the discussions
conducted with Mr. Theobald Theonest, Head of Drilling Section, Drilling and
Dam Construction Agency at Mwanza Office.

5. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
*: Field observations at site show clearly that oil spillage around the area is
notable. Areas around 'oil interceptor, storage tanks and drainage system
for extracted water from oils' show the extent of pollution on the ground.
See appendix 4.
*: The soils in the area are sandy in nature and rock mass is granitic whose
dominant jointing type is due to spherical weathering. Jointing system
may be moderate but infillings between the joints/faults may range from
clayey  to  gravel  materials  which  govern  the   degree  of
conductivity/permeability of the discontinuities.
*: It is therefore recommended to have two observation boreholes within the
site of Mwanza Nyakato PowerStation to cater for pollution monitoring
adequately. The indicative budget for drilling and testing is given in table
2. Recommended depth for each borehole is 20 m to cater for maximum
possible interception of discontinuities.
*: Equipment for water sampling and ground water measurements in the
observation holes must be purchased and kept at site.
* Recruiting a staff at Mwanza for sampling and measurements is essential.
This may be done by experts from Tanesco HQ during the drilling
supervision and testing period. A cost for the equipment will be
established at that in the later stage of the implementation.
*: A schedule of observations, sampling and testing should be devised by the
Environmental Engineer.
*: Analysis of the results should be done by TANESCO HQ Environmental
Engineer who will be responsible for advising on the strategies how to
control pollution.

Measurement of Baseline Environmental Information
At Mwanza Power Station
By
Dr. Eno& Masara
Chemical and Process Engineering Department, University of Dar es Salaam
1.    Introduction
The Mwanza power station is located in a rural area. There are no high rising
structures (i.e. tall buildings, hill tops, or thick forests) in the vicinity. The dispersion
of exhausts from stacks is thus free without significant downwashing due to high
rsing structures.
The setting of the investigation is shown in Figure 1. Major sampling points are
numbered (1-17) and labelled (A - D). Note that Figure 1 is not true to scale.
The following investigations were carried out as required bythe client:
i)    Noise measurement (results in Table 1);
ii)   Ambient air measurements for C02, 02, NO. and SO. (results in Table 2);
iii) Soil sampling and testing for heavy metals, and S042-, Cl- and NO3- (results
in Table 3);
iv)   Water sampling: ground or surface and testing for S042-, 1- and NO3- and
phenols (results in Table 4); and
v)    Sampling and testing for PCBs

2.4   Water sampling
No water wells were seen in and around the site, there is however a drain channels
that collects storrn water from the generator site and exits behind the staff houses by
the substation, this is the water that was sampled. At the time of sampling, the water
was stagnant. The results of the analysis are shown in Table 4.

2.5   PCBs testing
A number of decomnnissioned transformers are stored on site (on the site the new
generators will be installed), these transforners were inspected to identify year of
manufacture, place of origin, oil type, etc, for the purpose of checking if the
transformer oils were contaminated with PCBs, One transformer, fairly old by look of
design, and which had no name plate was sampled and the oil tested using the Clor-n-
oil PCB  screening test kit. The test kit works on the principle of chloride
determination since PCBs are chlorine based materials. Results showed that the PCBs
levels, if any, are less than 500 PPM which is the threshold management level in many
countries including developed countries.
3.    Conclusions
The power station is bordered by VETA, Nyakato steel mill, Birchad oil mill and the
Nyakato bottling plant on the North (across the main road) and the Mwanza knitting
(a nails plant now closed down) on the west. If operations from these industries
change significantly, the air quality and noise levels will be modified and deviate from
the results of this measurement.
The results reported are for environmental conditions that were prevailing on the day
of measurement, 27th March 2004 (34oC, and still wind of about 3.4 m/s).

APPENDIX 01
Environmental Audits of Thermal Power Plant and Power Co-generating Units
Draft Terms of Reference
Background
The Government has applied to IDA for an Emergency Power Generation Project which
is currently under preparation. The following are the options that are being assessed to assist
TANESCO in meeting its emergency power generation needs:
(i)  Incremental Fuel for Existing Thermal Power Plants: imported fuel to run the two existing
thermal power plants - at the Ubungo (up to 120MW) and Tegeta/IPTL (100MW) Power plant
facilities, at outputs exceeding non-drought generation levels (i.e. fuel costs incurred to offset
the impact of the drought). It should be noted that with regard to the Tegeta power plant, IDA is
reviewing the possibility of purchasing kWh output in accordance with the PPA, instead of fuel.
(ii)  Emergency Power Plants (EPPs): capacity payments and fuel costs for 30MW of new
short term, leased emergency power generation required to compensate for the reduced
hydropower output which is the result of drought. The EPP would be installed at the existing
Ubungo Power Plant facility, and would be fueled by gas. An EIA and Environmental audit has
already been carried out at this project site for the Songas facilities, under Credits 3569-TA and
2497-TA.
(iii)  Auto-generator Fuel and COgaciiy PgMents: cadacitv charges and fuel costs for up to 30
MW of existing (domestic) auto-generation capacity to augment the leased capacity noted in (ii)
above. This will include 18x I MW plant to be leased from the Geita gold mines an to be
installed at TANESCO's existing generation site at Mwanza, and about 10 private sector auto-
generators who will be providing power to the grid e.g.,(the sugar, mining and tobacco
industries, etc.).
Based on the recent Bank mission's discussions with TANESCO and assessment of
TANESCO's generation needs during the remainder of 2004, for the purposes of this
assignment, only the following aspects of the proposed Emergency Power Generation
Plan have been included in the proposed Environmental Audit at this time': (a)
Incremental power generation from the Ubungo and Tegeta Power plants as noted in (i)
above; and (b) auto generation from the Geita 18xlMW gensets at TANESCO's Mwanza
facilities, which forms part of (iii) above.
All World Bank investments need to comply with World Bank Safeguard Policies and
environmental guidelines as presented in the Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook
(1998) and EFC environmental guidelines (Thermal Power Rehabilitation, Electric Power
Transmission and Distribution, Occupational Health & Safety, PCBS, General Environmental
Guidelines and Monitoring), which can be found on the following website:
(http://ifclnl.ifc. orglifcextlenviro.nsf/Contentlenvironmentalguidelines
As existing generation sites would be utilized, there is no resettlement involved. The
emergency power plants should be operated in compliance with World Bank Safeguard Policies
and guidelines.  The World Bank Safeguard Policies applicable to this project are:
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), and Natural Habitat (OP 4.04) because of potential oil
pollution.



While occupational health standards for personnel working in the plants are known for the
Ubungo Power Plant Facility, an assessment of this aspect and the environmental situation would
be required for the Tegeta Power Plant (IPTL), and with regard to the TANESCO site at Mwanza
where it is intended to install the Geita gold mines' 18xlMW gensets.
Objectives of the Environmental Audit
The objectives of the environmental audit are to help the Government of Tanzania to
determine the environmental liabilities and the need for remedial actions necessary to bring the
enterprises into compliance with World Bank Safeguard Policies and environmental guidelines
with the objective to protect the health of workers and the general public living in the area and to
protect the environment.
It should be noted that an Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Audits
have already been carried out on the Ubungo Power Plant facilities as part of the Songo Songo
Gas Development and Power Generation Project (Credit 3569-TA). In addition, Songas has
prepared an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), including the monitoring of air emissions,
which should be in effect. Hence, the proposed assignment should begin with a desk review of
these reports and compliance with the existing EMP. Similarly, we understand that there are
periodic reports prepared by IPTL which should contain environmental and air emission data.
TANESCO's environmental unit should review all available reports, and summarize the important
aspects in the Environmental Audit.
The proposed environmental audits would identify historic pollution at the Ubungo, Tegeta
and Mwanza facilities, with a focus on hydrocarbons, and any need for remediation, including
urgency and costs. The audit would also analyze present waste management practices and
propose actions how to bring the waste management practices up to acceptable international
standards.  If not already carriedout at the Tegeta and Mwanza facilities, TANESCO's
environmental unit should analyze present air pollution and propose measures to bring air
pollution in compliance with World Bank Safeguard Policies and guidelines (Pollution Prevention
and Abatement Handbook 1998), and prepare an indicative budget, if required, to achieve these
goals. Air quality monitoring equipment may already be available in Tanzania2.
Scope of Work
The environmental audit will focus on the existing Ubung6 and Tegeta Thermal Power
Plant sites, and the proposed new site at TANESCO's facility in Mwanza where the 18xlMW
gensets from the Geita gold mines will be installed. The environmental audit will be carried out in
two phases:
Phase 1.- Meetings and Review
There will be initial briefing meetings between TANESCO's environmental unit and relevant
staff at the Ubungo, Tegeta and Mwanza power plant sites, as well as with other relevant
government representatives as deemed appropriate, such as Government of Tanzania
environmental staff.
TANESCO will: (a) gather and review all existing relevant in-house documentation,
including compliance records, for the Ubungo, Tegeta and Mwanza project sites; (b) study
available historical information; and (c) perform visual inspections of the Ubungo, Tegeta and
Mwanza facilities.
Phase I. Setting Priorities
2



Based the information made available in Phase 1, TANESCO's Environmental unit will:
*   identify all environmental (e.g. air and water emissions, hazardous wastes such as PCBS,
hydrocarbons, etc.) and occupational health and safety concerns related to both, past and
ongoing activities in the power plants;
*   visit areas where practices of waste management, storage and the use of dangerous
substances may have caused contamination (e.g. hydrocarbon pollution);
assess hazards or risks for local communities and the adequacy of procedures for warning
and emergency responses; consult with community leaders, if appropriate;
*   prepare a prioritized list of concerns (i.e. high, medium, low) related to past activities in the
sector;
concerning environmental, health and safety concerns, provide recommendations and cost
estimates if any rehabilitation and clean-up measures are required;
make recommendations and cost estimates for the implementation of any remediation action
plan deemed necessary to comply with IDA's safeguard policies. TANESCO should review
the existing Environmental Management Plans for the Ubungo and Tegeta facilities, and
prepare an Environmental Management Plan for TANESCO's Mwanza site.
* TANESCO should assess whether any other World Bank Safeguard Policies might apply.
Reporting
TANESCO will prepare a draft environmental audit report after 5 weeks, and send it to IDA
and NEMC for review and comments. Comments from the Government of Tanzania and the
World Bank should be integrated to produce the final report which should be completed after 7
weeks. The report should be written in English, and should include an Executive Summary. The
report will be finalized only after incorporation of comments made by the Government of
Tanzania and the World Bank.
The report should, if necessary, develop a prioritized remediation plan and its costs, define
the institutional responsibilities for clean-up; define the roles and responsibilities of agencies in
the monitoring and evaluation of clean-up and for regular follow-up, such as monitoring of air and
water emissions and hydrocarbon pollution and occupational health and safety.
Audit Team SkiUs
The environmental audit team should possess the necessary auditing skills as well as in
depth knowledge of the environmental aspects of the electricity sector.
Note
J If additional auto-generation or foreign EPP components were to be added to the proposed
project due to continued poor rains in the key catchment areas, an environmental audit of these
sites would be required.
2 TANESCO may wish to contact Songas (Phil Mason) since Songas hired the University to carry
out air quality monitoring on its behalf, and TANESCO might wish to pursue the same for the
Mwanza site.
