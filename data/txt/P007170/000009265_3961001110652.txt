lANK FO RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMEWT
TO TIE E$CCUTIVE DIRECTORS
0C A PROPOSED LUAX TO TME REPUBLIC 07 EL SALVADOR
MO  A POWER SECTOR SECNuICAL ASSITACE PROJECT
1.    1 submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of E1 Salvador, for the equivalent of US$11.0 million, to help
finence a power sector technical assistance project. The loan would be repaid
over 20 years,, including S years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable rate.
2.   JBckgjg2jd.  The Bank was closely involved with El Salvador's power sub-
sector until 1981, when the Seventh Power Project was completed. Since then,
creditworthiness concerns, the civil war and deteriorated business climate
resulted in a hiatus in Bank lending and only one new investment loan to El
Salvador was approved in 1987, to finance an earthquake reconstruction project.
3.    The otagnation of the economy during the 1980. was worsened by adverse
exogenous events, but the more fundamental factors were structural weaknesses and
continuing civil strife. In 1989, the now Goverrment introduced a comprehensive
economic stabilization and structural adjustment program which relies on market
forces and private sector efforts to promote sustained growth. The program is
complemented by a focused effort to alleviate poverty.  The economic policy
measures taken by the Government since then have begun to yield lmportant results.
The Central Bank's index of economic activity shows a significant reactivation of
the economy during 1990s GDP increased by about 3.42 and the fiscal deficit
declined as a result of the tax reforms and expenditure reduction measures.
Agricultural and comercial activities increased as a result of the relative price
corrections induced by more flexible trade and exchange rate policies. Compared
to 1989, exports grew by about 17S and imports by 92.  A Country Economic
Memorandum on E1 Salvador (No. 7818-ES) was circulated to the Exeeutive Directors
in August 1989. On Pebruary 12, 1991, the Bank approved a SAL to support the
Governmont's stabilization and adjustment program and the proposed Technical
Assistance Loan (TAL) would serve to improve the efficiency of the power sector,
while promoting important structural changes in the energy sector as a whole.
4.    The Enerw Sector.  The cwnmtry's energy use in 1990 is estimated at 2264
thousand TOE, or a ger capita consumption of 0.4 TOE per year, l.o.t less than
half of the Latin American average of 1.0 TOE per year. Wood, the primary source
of fuel for domestic use, accounted for 462 of the total energy supply in 1990,
oil imports (crude and derivatives) for 302, geothermal energy for 122,
hydroelectricity for 62, and bagasse and other biomass for 62. The degree of
electrification in E1 Salvador is low compared to that of other Latin American
countris;l it is estimated that only 542 of the population have access to
electricity (802 of the urban population and 232 of the rural population). A more
detailed overview of the sector is provided in Annex 1.
5.    The energy sector is not well organized.  It lacks an independent body to
establish energy policies, and there are several agencies responsible for energy
activities with little coordination among them.  The formulation of energy
policies, sector planning and development, issuance of standards for the energy
sector as well as the management of the power sub-sector are concentrated in the
Rio Lempa Electric Utility Company (CEL), a state-owned public utility. Since the



2
late 1970s, CEL ha been given Increasing responsibilities in the energy sector.
By 1989, the Government through CDL controlled all forms of hydrocarbons imports
and distribution, the generation and transmission of power, and distribution of
electricity.   In the past, the distribution of electricity (except for rural
areas) had been in the hends of the privits sector through conceosions that ended
In 1986, at which time the Government took over four of the seven distribution
companies. Currently, the nationalized distribution companies are managed by CEL.
Agreement on the price to be paid by the Government for the transfer of assets
from these nationalized companies to CDL has recently been reached, while
negotiations concerning the form and schedules of payment to the original owners
are advanced.
6.    While CEL, once a well run and financially sound utility,, wa  assigned
additional  responsibilities,  its  operational  and  financial  performance
deteriorated. 92gratlogally, the quality of service deteriorated because of lack
of sufficient resources for expansion and maintenance of facilities. inanciall#,
performance deteriorated due to low electricity rates and heavy debt service
burden.   At present, financial Indicators are poor, tariffs are well below
economic costs and the company relies on financial assistance from the Government.
Until February 1990, CEL earned significant profits from petroleum imports, which
partially masked its weak performance in electricity operations. Hydrocarbon
operations, however, have now been removed from CDL. Until 1986, distribution
investments were curtailed by the then private distribution companies, because of
the uncertainty regarding the status of their concessions, thus limiting the
expansion of electrification coverage and affecting the quality of the service.
Since 1986, the binding constraint to system expansion has been the lack of
financial resources, More detailed information on the institvtional and financial
performance of the power sub-sector Is provided in Annex 1.
7.    Rational  for Bank Ivolvement.  The Bank has developed a close policy
dialogue on macroeconomic issues with tho present administration. The proposed
operation presents the opportunity to expand this dialogue to the energy sector,
which if not properly managed could become a bottleneck to B1 Salvador's economic
growth. At the same time, the sector has a good potential for private sector
involvement which needs to be promoted. The proposed project would allow the Bank
to help the Government tot (a) develop its energy policy and improve the
efficiency of the energy sector through a reform of the Institutional and legal
framework; (b) study options to foster the participation of the private sector
in the power sub-sector; and (c) finance engineering studies for future generation
projects. The project would also enable the Bank to further expand its dialogue
to energy issues in general and identify future projects that may be suitable for
Bank financig. Because of the Importance attached to the policy goals that the
proposed project would pursue, the Bank ti uniquely placed to provide the
assistance proposed.  In addition, Bank participation would serve to attract
cofinanctng*
8.    Prolect Objectives.  The main objectives of the project are to assist the
Government to Improve the efficiency of the energy sector by providing a sound
legal, institutional and regulatory framework, fostering sound planning and
pricing policies, attracting private sector particd.ation to the power sector, and
strengthenig CEL' sefficiency and management. These objectives would be achieved
throught (a) the formulation of an energy policy document; (b) transferring the



S
policy and regulator- functions from CEL to a regulatory body to be createdt (c)
reforming the organazation of the sector to foster private sector participation
in the power sub-sectors (d) assistauce in redesigning the structure of
electricity rates to ensure that they promote conservation and provide signals to
consumers that are based on marSginal cost criteria and provide for adequate
finacial health of the utilities; (e) preparing a portfolio of power generation
projects to ensure that future expansion decisions consider a reasonably wide
range of options and that their environmental impact is adequately studied; and
(f) Improving management capabilities within CEL, Including handling of
environmental issues. In addition, the project would seek to initiate a process
of improvements in the oil sub-sector, through an operational audit of the oil
refinery.
9.    Project  Descrlotion.    The  proposed  project  would  consist  of  four
componentst   (a) Sector Studies  (base costt US$1.3 million)  to  (i) draft
regulations governing the energy sector, develop a detailed proposal for the
functions and organization of a regulatory body, propose an action plan to carry
out the reforms, and draft a new electricity law taking into account future
participation of the private sector; (i) define the methodology and propose an
action plan to set electricity rates based on marginal cost criteria; (iii) value
the assets of the power distribution companies and propose an action plan to allow
their priva.z-ation (this study will also assess the viability of private
investors in the power sector); and (iv) carry out an operating performance audit
at the oil refineryT (b) Knaineerint and Manazement Studleso (base costs US$7.3
million) including (i) pre-feasibility studies of hydro generation projects, a
feasibility study of a thermal power project, and evaluation of the the geothermal
potential of the Berlin field; (11) assessment of the reliability of the
transmission system and of the damags caused by terrorist attacks; (iii)
evaluation of the quality of service of the distribution systems, the impact of
distribution livestment restrictions on the system's reliability, and
recommendation of measures to improve distribution reliability and planning,
including the preparation of distribution standards; and (iv) assessment of the
management efficiency and organization of CEL (including strengthening of the in-
house environmental unit and formulation of a training program on environmental
matters) and development of proposals to Improve it; (c) acouisition of eauinment
and mjtgrjalg (base costs US$2.9 million) to improve planning, electricity rate
design, system reliability, billing and collection; and (d) a training pro-raw
(base cost: US$0.4 million) vhich would include (i) training for government
officials  at  the  regulatory  body  that  would  be  assigned  regulatory
responsibilities, and (11) a management development program and a specialized
traming of CEL's high level staff. The equipment to be purchased under the
project would consist mainly of vehicles, electrical measurement and testing
equipment and data processing equipment.
10.   Prjolct Cost  And ZTIaUM21.   The total cost is estimated at US$14.1
million, of which US$12.1 million is the foreign exchange component. The Bank
would finance US$11.0 million. The loan would be made to the Governmet, which
would on-leand to CEL US$9.4 million, with the same grace period, repayment term
and interest rate as the Bank loan. The balance of US$1.6 million would finance
sector studies and training to be undertaken by the Government. CEL will bear the
foreign ewchange and interest rate risk on its subloan. The project envisages the
participation of USAID, and grants from IDB, and UNDP to finance engineering and



4
angement studies.  The Japanese Government has approved a grant to finance the
preparation of a feasibility study of a thermal power project. Local costs of
equipment would be financed by the Borrower. Retroactive financing as from March
31, 1991 up to US$0.5 million is recommen6ed so that the engagement of consultants
may be expedited. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.  Procureent of goods atid engagement of consultanto would follow Bank
guidelines. Mothodc of procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank operations in
El Salvador are given in Schedule C and D. More details on project fimplementation
are given in Annex 2.
11.    Co-f nanc_n_.   The proposed operation would play a catalytic role in
attracting technical assistance financing from other development institutions and
donors to the energy sector. The Government has requested financing to USAID to
carry out engineering studies to prepare the distribution companies for
privatisation.  1DB 1.8 also financing consultants to prepare a financial plan for
the period 1991-1995, to carry out geothermal power plant studies at the
Ahuaciapan field, to review the cost estimates of generation projects, and to
prepare a preliminary power expansion plan. UNDP is financing the preparation of
terms of reference for the management study.  The Goverrment is committed to
provide all counterparts funds for the project although part of suCh funds are
expected to be received from cofinanciers.
12.   Actions aoreed.  At negotiations, the Government furnished a statement of
energy sector policy (Annex 3), and a proposed training program (Annex 4), both
of which are satisfactory.   The terms of reference for the sectoral and
engineering studies funded by the loan were agreed vith the Government and CEL,
respectively, during negotiations, except for the terms of reference for the asset
valuation of the power distribution companies study and the operating management
audit which will be furnished by loan effectiveness. Anreemento were also reached
with the Govennment tot  (a) Set-up a Sectoral Special Unit (SSU) within the
Ministry of Planning, which will be responsible for the execution of the sectoral
studies; (b) maintain the SSU with satisfactory staff during the period of project
execution, (c) carry out by October 31, 1992, a study to reform the legal,
institutional and regulatory framework of the energy sector, in line with the
Government's sector strategy, including the creation of a regulatory body for the
sector, and drafting a new electricity law; (d) develop an electricity pricing
policy based on marginal cost criteria, by October 31, 1992; (e) exchange views
with the Bank on the conclusions and recommendations on the studies to formulate
tho reforms outlined in (c) and the policy outlined in (d) above, and prepare an
action plan satisfactory to the Bank, to implement such recommendations by
December 31, 1992; (f) complete with the assistance of consultants the asset
valuation of the power distribution companies study and the operating performance
audit of the oil refinery by March 31, 1992, and February 28, 1992, respectively.
Aare_ments were reached with CEL to: (g) prepare a power expansion plan not later
than December 31, 1993, based on least cost criteria, that adequately takes
environmental costs into account, as well as the results of the engineering
studies proposed in this loan; (h) prepare a financial rehabilitation plan for CEL
with well defined performance targets, by June 30, 1992. It was also agreed that
the Government and CEL: (i) will hire individual consultants, satisfactory to the
Bank, to assist them in the review of the sector and engineering studies,
respectivelys and (j) will hold with the Bank an Annual Review by March 31 of each



S
year to review their progress in the sector, engineering, and management studies
and In the implementation of the Government's sector policieo, and to diecus. the
results the previous year's training program and the program for the next year.
Conditions of loan effectiveness would bet (M) the execution of a subsidiary loan
agreement between the Government and CEL, satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) the
preparation of an Implementation schedule for the training program, including the
selection of the staff to be trained under procedures acceptable to the lank; and
(111) the presentation to the Bank of terms of reference, satisfactory to the
Bank, for the asset valuation of the power distribution companies study and the
operational performance audit.
L3.  BjgElots.  The proposed technical assistance loan is expected to make an
important contribution to the energy sector by assisting the Government in the
implementation of institutional reforms that would improve efficiency, and
eventually attract private investors to the power sub-sector.   Reforms to
electricity pricing policy would help reduce the financial burden that the sub-
sector poses to the Government and would allow the power sub-sector to fund its
own investment needs.   Due to a small portfolio of alternative generation
expansion options, CEL expansion plan is mostly based on geothermal power
projects. The proposed engineering studies would enable CIL to consider other
alternatives, suci- as thermal and hydro projects. Transmission studies would also
allow consideration of actions to reduce transmission losses.
14.   Risk.  Because of the nature of the project, it poses no significant
technical risks. However, the implementation of the broad range of policy reforms
that it is designed to support greatly depend on congressional and popular
support, the availability of good technical staff, and the outcome of the ongoing
peace efforts, First, some opponents of the Government's privatization policies
are likely to be critical of the policy goals of the operation. Second, the
Government lacks experienced staff to regulate public utilities and the regulatory
framework is still in an inception stage. Third, the ability to attract well
qualified consultants and the future participation of private investors in the
power sub-sector would be affected if terrorist activities continue. In addition,
attracting private capital to the sector will be contingent upon a satisfactory
resolution of pending issues with the owners of the distribution companies whose
concessions expired in 1986. These risks will be mitigated substantially through
training (funded by the loan) and a public information campaign that the
Government intends to undertake. By and large, the risks outside the control of
Government seem reasonable and are expected to be offset by the significant
potential benefits of the reform process, which is already under way. Government
performance under the stabilization and adjustment program has been excellent,
reflecting a strong commitment to its goals.
15.   Recommendatinoa    I am satisfied that the propored loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed project.

311191 SECTOR OVERVIEW
A. Energy S0etor Structuro nd Pollicie.
Enermv Resourcos a*d Consuntion
1.    E1 8slvador's  indigenous  energy  resources  are  scarce*   Off-shore
exploration carried out and conducted during the decade of the 1970., funded by
UNDP, has not led to the identification of any commercially exploitable oil
deposit. The country's hydroelectric potential is estimated at 1600 MW, of which
251 has been installed.  Geothermal potential is estimated at 330 NW, but
extensive field exploration would be needed before assessment can be made of its
commercial viability.   So far, 95 MW in geothermal power plants has beon
installed and about 200 MW are expected to be installed within the next ten
years. Bsgasse potential has not been sufficiently studied.
2.    The country's energy supply In
1990 is estimated at 23,068 Tcal                       GRAPH 1
(equivalent to 2,264 thousand TOR).              GOr  Eney &Sp  (TTO
As shown in Graph 1, wood, the
primary source of fuel for domestic
use, accounted for 461 of the total
energy supply in 1990. Oil imports        mEur"AiWS HyMM             WOS
(crude and derivatives) accounted        PEThLMS
for  301  of  the  total  energy
consumed, geothermal energy for 122,      WOMAUS
hydroelectricity 61, and bagasse and                             at
other biomass for 61. The gross                  1980            1980
energy  consumption  by  source  of              (NW9
energy shows that the contribution
of wood decreased by 8S, compared                         _
with the 1980 level, while the share
of petroleum increased.  Expected
increased consumption in transport                     GRAPH 2
is   likely   to   be   partially                 Gss Enry Uss (TO)
compensated    by    decrease   In
consumption in pavoer generation,
with the commissioning of geothermal
and  hydro  projects  now  under           LOSus  EeM               w^<P# 
consideration.                                                        4m
3.   The pattern of energy use has    wTAMW.                            4
changed since 1980 (see Graph 2)* In                       E   as
1990,  final  consumption  for  the              1980            1990
comercial and residential sector                 S'       
accounted for 441, compared to 571
in 1980, and the transport and



11
industrial sectors accounted for 372 (282 in 1980). This trend is likely to
continue with increased economic growth and urbanization.
4.   The degree of electrification in E1 Salvador is low compared to that of
other Latin American countries, although access to electricity increased from 332
in 1980 to about 542 of the population in 1990. Almost 802 of urban centers have
electricity service, as compared with only 232 of the rural population.
Electricity per capita consumption at 356 Kwhlyear is low if compared, for
example, with 1150 Kwh per year for Costa Rica and 1090 Kwh per year for Panams.
Industrial consumption, which accounted for 312 in 1990, was lower than the 1980
level during the period 1980-1986 due to the stagnation of the economy, and only
recovered the level of 1980 during the period 1987-1989. Residential (362), and
government and municipal (18S) consumption steadily grew (S 4p. a. ad 6.22 p.a.,
respectively) during the period 1980-1990 partly bCeause of the connection of new
customers but also, due to the lack of an energy conservation policy and low
electricity rates. Coumercial consumption (152) increased at 4.62 p.s.
Enerav Sector Oraanisation
5.    The energy sector is not well organised, as there is a high degree of
intervention from the Government and there are several agencies responsible for
energy activities with little or any coordination among them. The Ministry of
Economy supervises the sector and sets energy prices, and the Ministry of
Planning reviews and approves the expansion plans of the sector. Responsibility
for the formulation of energy policies, planning and development, Issuance of
norms and standards and management of the power sub-sector is concentrated in the
Comisi4n Ejecutiva Hidroel6ctrica del Rio Lempa (CEL), a state-owned public
utility. Other entities involved in the hydrocarbon sector are: the Oil Refinery
of Acajutla (RASA) owned by Esso (652) and Shell (352), which refines the crude
and stores derivatives, and five private distributors of fuels. In addition to
CXEL the Ministry of Agriculture through the Direction of Natural Resources, and
the Ministry of Economy through the National Institute of Sugar (Alcohol) are
also involved in the renewable resources sector.
6.    Since the late 1970s, CEL has been given increasing responsibilities in the
energy sector. Before CEL's creation in 1945, electricity needs were served
exclusively by private companies in the main cities.  The Government first
entrusted to CXL the responsibility of studying the hydro resources of the Rio
Lemp8 and later added the responsibility of generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity for public service as well as development of an
interconnected system. Since 1980, CEL had also the responsibility of planning
and supervising the development of all   energy resources.   By 1989, the
Government through CIL controlled the exploitation and supply of hydrocarbons,
and the generation and transmission of power, and distribution of electricity.
CXL is naw operating the formerly pr..vate distribution poer utilities whose
concession finished in 1986  This varied array of activities has resulted in a
transfer of policy making powers to an agency that is not well suited to that
function and have distracted CXL from its former main business: provision of
electricity service. Based on a study carried out by consultonts financed by
USAID in November 1989, the Government took some actions to reduce CUL'e
responsibility in the energy sector and to improve the efficiency of the sectors



12
(a) In February 1990, petroleum oil activities were transferred to the Ministry
of Economy; and (b) the fuel oil oubsidy to CEL Was cut and a thermal surcharge
in the electricity rate was introduced. Actions to be carried out in the medium
torm are doecribed in para. 11.
Govewumet Stratew in- the ra ry Sector
7.    The Government recognizes the strategic role of the energy sector and its
contribution to the economy. To promote th. development of the sector, the
Government wants to strengthen the role of market forces In the allocation of
resources, develop a regulatory capacity, and play an active but subsidiary role
in the expansion of the sector, allowing for an increased private participation.
Accorditgly, the Government's actions are focussing ont (a) making institutional
and legal reforms with the objective of separating clearly the State's regulatory
functions from its role as owner of public utilities; (b) facilitating private
sector participation in the power sub-oector; (c) basing pricing policies on
economic principles (marginal costs) and flnancial considerations; (d) developing
information systems on energy technologies which should facilitate the efficient
use (and conservation) of energy resourcos; and (e) protecting the environment
in all activities related to the energy sector.
8.    The Government intends to gradually reduce its participation in and the
business functions of the public entities involved in the sector. Specifically,
the Government is considering to issue a new electricity law removing from CXL
a number of responsibilities regarding policy formulation, energy planning and
regulation of the sector. For this purpose, a new regulatory agency, under the
President of the Republic would be set up. The major functions of this agency
would be to: (a) study and propose majcr sector legislation and regulations for
the energy sector; (b) plan and coordinate major sector investments, particularly
in the power sub-sector; (c) approve major public investments In the sector
together with the Ministry of Planning; (d) represent the Government in the
promotion, negotiation and signature of major petroleum contractst (e) contract
geologic studies for the evaluation of energy resources; and (f) strengthen the
capabilities of the energy sector Institutions for dealing with environmental
matters. This new agency would coordinate activities with the proposed National
Environment Commission, which would be composed of all Ministers directly or
indirectly involved with environmental issues and would be presided by the
President of the Republic, who would delegate to the Minister of Agriculture.
9.   Planned new legislation for the electricity sub-sector is considered a key
condition to attract greater private sector participation. The legislation would
includes (a) the concession regime for the private sector with defined service
responsibilities and cancellation provisions in case of poor service, or other
violations of the law and regulations; and (b) clear rules for the calculation
of generation and distribution electricity rates and their adjustment, to take
into account inflation, exchange rate variations or other causes.
10. Power sub-sector goals of the Government include the re-privatization of
the power distribution companies and the participation of the private sector in
co-generation. As the current owners of the companies are not interested In
continuing participating in the distribution business, negotiations between the
Government and main shareholders on the method of payment for the companies'



13
assets are now under way. Settlement of this "ssue will give legal ownership of
those asets to the State and open the way for their future re-privatization.
3. Hydrocarboan ub-sector
11. The present Government has already begun a major overhaul of the
hydrocarbon sector. All petroleum operations were transferred from CDL to the
Ministry of Economy. The Government is planning to modify the hydrocarbon law
to attract risk capital to the oil sub-sector.  The sew lAw would set only
general conditions and would empower the executive branch to set specific
conditions in each operation. In addition to these measures, the Government
plans over the medium term tot (a) revise the hydrocarbon legislation, free all
petroleum prices, and eliminate all tax benefits and exemptions; (b) set up a tax
regim for the hydrocarbon sub-sector similar to the system for other economic
activities; and (c) replace the diesel subsidy for public tranoportation by a
direct subsidy to low Income groups through mechanisms still, being defined.
12. 51 Salvador imports crude mainly from Venezuela and Mexico through the Son
Jose Agreement which represents for the country security of supply and financial
benefits. Crude is refined by RASA, a private company installed in 1960 in its
refinery located at Acajutla under a cost plus contract. The Government is
currently revising its policy regardting oll crude and derivatives supply and
pricing. Zirst, because the refinery installations are technologically obsolete
and physically old, the derivatives mix does not fit the country's necessities
and operating costs are high. Second, procedures for setting prices by the
Ministry of Economy (para. 13) introduces distortions in the economy.   The
results of such revision is likely to conduct towards liberalization of crude
trade and petroleum products prices. As a first step towards liberalization, the
Government intends to assess the remaining useful life, the operating costs and
environmental effects of the refinery. The proposod project would help the
Government to fin4nce such study which would provide options and recommendations
regarding the possible dismantling or renovation of the refinery.
13. The price structure of petroleum derivatives is complex due to a
combination of taxes, comissions, funds and subsidies.  Diesel for public
transportation has been highly subsidized, causing serious economic distortions.
Though domestic oil prices are still controlled by the Ministry of Economy, they
were adjusted to international levies in October 1990. However, the adjustment
was uneven involving significant cross subsidieso  the prices of special and
regular gasoline (US$2.0 per gallon and US$1.7, respectively) were increased
through extra levies that are used to subsidize the price of diesel fuel (US$0.2
per gallon) for public transportation, which has been kept unchanged.

14. CEL is in charge of generating and transmitting power throughout the
country and of distributing electricity in rural areas (about 1LZ of the total).
In the past, the distribution of electricity (except for the rural area) was in
the hands of the private sector through concessions that ended in 1986. Since



14
then, four of seven distribution companies are under the administration of CEL.
The Electtic Power Company of E1 Salvador (CABSS), formerly a private company and
now controlled by CEL, distributes electricity in the capital city and onvirons,
representing about 72Z of the total consumption of the country. Other six power
companies distribute 172 of the total retail consumption.
15.   CEL is managed by an eight-member Board of Directors, six of them are
appointed by the Government, one by the local commercial banks, and one by
bondholders. CDL reports to the Ministry of Economy, but the president of the
Board is appointed by the Minister of the Interior. The Board approves major
investment plans, borrowing proposals, and corporate policies, and recommends
power rate changes to the Governmento External borrowing is approved by the
Ministry of Planning, the annual budget by the Ministry of Finance, and rate
increases by the Ministry of Economy These arrangements would be reviewed under
the sector studies included in the project.
Tower Facilities
16.   In 1990, the installed capacity of the country, excluding installations
owned by private industry to meet its own needs (4S MW), was 665 MW, of which 403
MW was hydro, 167 MW convontional thermal, and 95 MW geothermal. CEL's installed
capacity amounted to 650 MW, CAESS has installed 12 MW in hydro power plants, and
the rest of the distribution utilities had installed 3 MW in small hydro plants.
Gross power generation amounted to 2243 GWh of which 1674 GWh (752) was hydro,
419 GWh (192) geothermal, and 150 GWh (62) thermal. During 1980-1990, sales
growth vas oly 3.92 per year, compared to the 8.82 of the 1970's decade; this
reflects the economic stagnation experienced by the country. Due to frequent
sabotage to transmission lines, hydra plants are not operated at fully capacity
and CEL had to generate with thermal plants, and had to over-exploit the
production of geothermal installations. Since 1987, CEL has also had low hydro
generation due to abnormally dry seasons. As a result of this, thermal plants
have been operated more frequently in the last three years. Some of them have
been out of service to be repaired and will be re-comaissioned shortly.
17. The transmission system has suffered substantial destruction due to civil
war related sabotage, which has frequently required CDL to reconnect the system
in precarious conditions. As a result, reliability Is low and power losses have
increased during the last decade from about 122 in 1980 to 16.82 in 1990. Since
1980 up to December 1990, over 2000 terrorist attacks on substations and 3800 on
the transmission system have damaged the power system with a direct cost to CEL
amounting about US$198 million.
18. The distribution system is overloaded due to the minimum amount of
livestment carried out by the distribution companies during the last decade, as
their concessions expired. Because of private sector uncertainty, both regarding
the political environaent and the compensation that they would receive from the
Government, distribution investments prior and after the transfer of activities
to CEL have been very low, thus limiting the electrification of the country and
the quality of the service. Also distribution poles and transformers in San
Salvador have been damaged by terrorist attacks.   There is no distribution
expansion planning at CEL.   Planning, design, and equipment standards are
different among distributions utilities, making a nationwide integration of



15
operations diffio.ult. Large investments are needed to modernize the distribution
facilities and tj Improve the quality of service.
19.  Growing concerns caused by the overall environmental deterioration of the
overpopulated country have prompted the government to establish a Natural
Environment Commission which will be in charge of setting environmental policies
and control procedures. In line with this action, the Bank and the Government
agreed at negotiations that terms of reference for the proposed engineeriAg
studies would ensure that social and onvironmental aspects related to existing
and new power projects are duly taken into account. Major euvironmental concerns
are related to watershed erosion and blocked fish migration, In case of
hydropower projects, and toxic releases in water and steam discharges from
goothermal power plants. Thus, the proposed engineering studies will include
diagnosis, analysis and recommendations to mitigate possible environmental damage
caused by existing and new hydro and thermal facilities. CEL's capacity to deal
with environment matters is weak. The Institutional development project for the
Central American countries (DIEXCA - Phase II), financed by UNDP, will look into
this issue and would proposed actions and a training program to address them.

20.      There  are no major power                        GRAPH 3
plants under construction.  Due to               EL SALVADOR: Lod & Firm Capaty
the civil war and economic recession,
electricity demand growth in the past        x o
several years has been low, therefore
no  new  capacity  addition  to  the
system was required.   Power demand
projections prepared by CEL assume an 
average growth of 72 p.a. during  the
period   1990-2005,   which   seems             ............
reasonable if the civil war does end                      an U"    U,   tC    ma.
soon  and  the   business   climate                    OLOAD = MU
improves (demand incroesed 92 last
year). The uncertainty as to this
outcome,   however,   suggests   the
advisability of expanding generation
capacity through small projects, that do not entail signifiesat financial
commitments, so as to minimize the opportunity cost of idle capacity. Total
generation reserves, as shown in Graph 3, seem also reasonable, taking into
account the uncertainty of demand growth snd geothermal availabilities.
21.      CEL's power expansion plan is now based foremost on geothermal energy
(see Graph 4). In 1990 geothermal accounted for 102 of total firm power capacity.
It would increase to 202 by year 2000. Hydro firm capacity in 1990 accounted for
712 and would decrease to 60S by the year 2000. Thermal plants, using imported
fuels, would conserve their share of about 192 of total firm energy. Pre-
feasibility studies of hydro projects would enable to decide on best alternatives
to proceed with feasibility and final design studies and increase the hydro share
in the expansion plan. Over the next decade sector investment requirements are
large, probably in the neighborhood of US$90 million per year for generation, and
US$10 million for transmission. However, these figures are not reliable since

being  considered.    In  spite  of           o OIIIMS  flU
political problems and guerrilla
actions    against    electrical
installations in the country, CEL has
been  able to maintain  an  acceptable  quality  of  service.    In  general,
professionals are technically well qualified but management cadres are thin. In
the last three years, salary levels have been lower than the private labor market
average.   In 1990, CEL had about 3300 employees (including 472 permanent
professional staff). This staff level is somewhat high, but overstaffing is
mainly due to the personnel required for securing transmission system
installations and repairing lines, towers and poles damaged by terrorist attacks.
CEL has taken measures to reduce personnel by freezing new contracts.
23.   Some admiuistrative deficiencies exist. Financial planning is weak. There
is lack of financial planning capability at the management level and the
financial planning models in use need to be upgraded.   Currently, CEL has
designed a new model for financial planning with the assistance of the Bank,
which will be in operation shortly; IDB will engage a consultant to prepare a
medium term financial plan for the period 1991-95. Information is not integrated
into a management information system geared to decision making. There is not an
integrated corporate budget system and control. Current budget procedures and
controls are imposed by the Government and are very burdensome. The internal
auditor reports to the Executive Director, but its functions are mostly limited
to prepare special reports to the presidency, and to address legal procedures and
taxation issues. The auditing scope needs to be broadened to include supervision
of all accounting systems and internal controls. The organization to address
environmental issues is poor, and training on these topics is required. The
DIZICA II project will look into these issues and will propose action to address
them. IDB would finance the consultant services to help CEL to carry out actions
proposed in the DIEICA project.
CEL'. Finances
24.  Before 1978, CEL's financial performnce was satisfactory.  Since then,
CEL'. financial performance deteriorated as a result of the failure to increase
electricity rates and of increasing operating expenses caused by the civil war.
In 1986, CEL's financial situation was further worsened by the currency
devaluation, which increased the burden of the debt service, and by the rise of
accounts receivable from industrial customers and distribut'on companies. CEL
had to rely on short-term debt and on revenues from the commercialization of



17
Imported petroleum to finance its operating and capital budget. Until February
1990, CEL earned significant profits from petroleum imports.
25.  As a result of Its financial deterioration, CEL has not been able to
contribute to the financing of its investment needs. The estimated return on
average fixed assets declined from 14.52 in 1980 to about 3.62 in 1990. Due to
the devaluation of the currency in 1986, debt service doubled absorbing all of
the company's internal cash generation and leaving no funds to finance its
investment needs. CEL's total indebtedness at the end of 1990, was equivalent
to US$285 million, of which 89S corresponded to long-term loans from IDB (582),
1IRD (192), Venezuelan Investment Fund (VIP) (92) and CABDI (32). Up to February
1991, CEL's overdue debt service payment to the Government amounted to VS$68
million. CEL would prepare a Financial Rehabilitation plar. proposing actions to
address these issues by June 30, 1992.
26.   As of February 1991, accouuts receivable amounted to US$32 million,
equivalent to 269 days of billing.   Overdue accounts of the distribution
companies smounted to US$23 million, representing about 6 months of billing,
industrial sector US$9 million (3 years), and rural customers US$2 million (6
months). Arrears from distribution companies are expected to be settled after
negotiations are concluded (para. 11). The Water Company (AhDA) accounted for
552 and the cement company (MAYA) for 36S of the arrears of the industrial
sector; CEL is negotiating an agreement with MAYA to pay the arrears. The
collection problems of the rural customers will be reviewed under the management
audit to be carried out under this project.
Ilectricity Pricing
GRAPH 6
27.  Electricity rates are not based               EvOutin of Eletflrty Rates
on economic criteria. There  is no           o__OF_________OF_mm
legislation   establishing   pricing
principles and CEL is not allowed to        u ,
adjust electricity rates automatically     1.
to offset inflation, devaluation or         10
operating cost increases.   In 1980
prices,  electricity  rates  sharply
deteriorated during the period 1980-
1989, as shown in the attached figure.      4
In  1990,  residential  rates  were
increased by 251 and industrial rates          MaUnA W              EDu8TftAJ.
and  commercial  rates  by  92,  as
compared to 1989 reaching all of them
the same level of 3.6 US cent/kwh.
However, average rate levels would have to be increased by about 1252 (in nominal
terms) to allow a rate of return on revalued assets of about 72 and a financing
program that would allow funding investment requirements without Government
support.   Studies carried out by consultants also show that with such an
increase, long-run marginal cost levels would be met. The tariff structure is
also distorted as a result of the low rates applied to residential customers.
During the last decade, the average rate for residential customers represented
about 852 of the rate applied to industrial customers even though the cost of
serving residential consumers is higher. As a result, consumers do not have



is
adequate incentives to conserve energy. The tariff study to be financed under
this project is expected to provide recommended rate schedules based on marginal
cost principles. The Finaneial Rehabilitation Plan, which is to be prepared
under the project should include a satisfactory program for aligning rates with
costs.
ank Lendina to the Pow?:r  ub-sctor.
28. Prom 1949 and until 1981, the Bank's group participated in financing the
development of hydro and geothermal power projects. One credit and seven loan.
were made (including a third window loan to the Government for on-lending to CEL)
amounting to US$97.1 million. The first five loans (US$52.1 million) helped to
finance the development of : (a) The Lempa River and its tributaries and (b) the
geothermal field at Ahuachapan. The credit (US$5.6 million) helped to finance
the construction of a gas turbine plant at Soyapango. All the works financed by
the first five loans were completed and are in normal operation. The last two
loans helped to finance the geothermal power plant at Ahuachapan. The seventh
project was completed satisfactorily, but with 472 cost overruns, due to
substantial increases of drilling work and affluent discharge canal, but only
with six month delay. Th. two project performance audit reports (Report No. 862,
Credit 227-IS, September 10, 1975, and Report No. 889-3S, June 27, 1980)
concluded that the physical objectives of the projects were met, albeit with cost
overruns, and the financial objectives were also met during the period of project
execution. However, the project completion report of Loans 1288-IS and 1289-ES,
dated July 27, 1984, concluded that Government failure to tsplement adequate rate
increases during the period 1977 to 1981 prevented CEL from complying with its
financial covenants. During the absence of the Bank from the sector, sector
finances deteriorated substantially as the Government let electricity rates erode
and efficiency and pToductivity also dropped.

1.   CRL'. Planning Directorate will have overall responsibility for project
organization, managment and administration within CEL and for project
implementation vith external suppert from individual consultants and consultant
firms. Terms of refereace were agreed at negotiations based on drafts in the
project file. For the engineeriAg studies, specialized consulting firms, with
strong background in power system, would be required. As requested by the Bsak,
a Sectoral Special Unit (SSU) wss establisbed in the Ministry of Planning to be
responsible for the execution of the sectoral studies and follow up oan
recommendation of the consultants. So as to facilitate project lmplementation,
the 85U Director participatod In the negotiations. At negotiations, agreement
wa reached that the 88U shall be maintained with satisfactory staff during
project execution. This SSU would have an active role in energy sector planning
and policy-making in the future.   Sectoral studies would require highly
specialised consultants with previous experience in  sbiilar tasks.   The
Attachment 1 to this Annex shows the mplementation schedule of the studies. On
March 31 of each year during Project implementation the Govarenaot end CEL will
exchange views with Bank on the progress achieved. Attacbhont 2 to this Annex
shows a Mattri of Key Project Activities to be reviewed during the Annual
Meeting. Iudividual consultants acceptable to the Bank would be engaged by the
concerned institutions to help the SSt and CEL in the review of the sector and
engineering studies, respectively. for the 85U, an international-known expert
in regulatory policy and marsginal cost pricing is required. for CEL, an expert
in hydro plants is required as voll as an environment specialist. The cost of
these consultant services would be borne by the corresponding institutions.
2.       Consultants would be selected In aecordance with Bank guidelines for
consulting services. Electric measurement equipment to be financed by the
proposed loan would be packaged Into a single contract estimated to cost about
US$2,400,000 and would be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Due to requirements of software compatibility
sad standardization, computer hardware and software for an aggregate value
estimated at US$350,000 would be procured through lItited international tendering
(LIB). Vehicles for working purposes for an aggregate value estimated at
US$250,000 will also procured through LIB. Materials and miscellaneous equipment
for training purposes estimated to cost less than US$25,000 per contract and in
an aggregate amount not exceedting US$600,000 would be procured by local or
International shopping. Prior review of procurement decisions will be required
for ICB and LIB procureent.

3.       The proposed loan would finance  100% each of the foreign cost of
*qulpmnt, the total cost of consultant services, and the foreign expenditures
of the trainfig program. Retroactive financing In an aggregat. amount of up to
US$500,000 is proposed for any of the Bank-finaced contracts awarded In
accordance with Baok guideline after March 31, 1991. To provide an expeditious
flow of funds, a Special Account in the amount of US$0.75 million, representing
four months of average expenditures, would be opened at a bank acceptable to the
BDak for payment of eligible goods and services. The Special Account would be
replenished by the BDnk upons (a) receipt of statement of expenses (803)
presented by the Borrower for (i) all expenditures for contracts or purchase
orders valued at U8$10,000 or les, (ii) all expenditures for the training
program, and (IIi) consultant services and equipment purchase expenditures
against contracts valued at US$25,000 or less, and (b) all other fully documented
disburseemnt applications for eligible goods and services.
4.   Although the sector and engineering studies would last leos  then three
years, a disburseemet period of four and a half year has been estimated oan the
basis of standard disbursement profiles for Technical Assistance Projects In the
Bank's Latin American and Caribbean region. The project vould be completed by
December 31, 1995, and the closntg date of the loan would be June 30, 1996.
Atgonts ad Audit
s.   The Borrower and the Ixecuting Agency would establish and maintain project
accounts for all expenditures financed under this loan in a clear identifiable
manner. The Special Account, as well as the project accounts and supporting
records pertaining to the services and goods financed under the loan would be
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and the audit
reports would be submitted within four months after the close of the fiscal year,
and CEL's financial statements would be also audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank, and the audit reports would be submitted within
four mnths after t1'o close of CEL's fiscal year.

EL SALVADMR - POWER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
STATEMENT OF ENERGY POLICY
1.        The Government of E1 Salvador's Economic and Social Development
Plan on 1989-1994 focusses on recovering the economy towards sustained growth
and on reducing poverty. To set the stage for economic recovery, the
Government has Implemented a strong stabilization program and introduced a
structural adjustment program. The main bases for the Government's plans are:
(a) a substantial reduction of the Goverment's intervention in the
economy, leaviag room for increased participation of the private
sector in economic activities;
(b) deregulation of markets;
(c) removal of trade barriers; and
(d) maintenance of strict monetary and fiscal discipline.
2.        Given its Importance in the economy, the energy sector is critical
to the Government's economic restructuring policies. Thus, the Government has
assigned the highest priority to energy policies which will result in secure,
timely, efficient and low cost supply of energy. The objectives of these
policies will be to:
(a) increase the efficiency of public energy sector agencies and ensure
their financial autonomy,
(b) reduce the direct involvement of the Government in commercial
activities of the energy sector and increase the participation of
the private investor in such sector,
(c) liberalize prices of tradable energy products, and establish stable
and efficient procedures for regulating prices of energy products
produced by natural monopolies,
(d) promote development of new indigenous energy sources, and
(e) place due protection to the environmont in all activities related
to the energy sector.
3.        The Government recognizes that the current legal, institutional and
regulatory framework are not conductive to economy and efficiency and has
initiated a major overhaul of the whole energy sector in support to the above
policy goals which will give priority to:
(a) restructuring of the legal and regulatory framework for the energy
sector, including the establishment of a central policy and
planning body and a regulatory agency, separating the Government's
regulatory functions from its role as owner of public utilip4t o,

ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 2
(b)  restructuring of the energy sector Institutions, promoting
decentralUzation and enabling the possible future privatization of
public utilities,
(c)  establishing pricing policies and procedures, free from political
and other interferences, which would reflect the economic cost of
the corresponding products and allowing for the financial soundness
of the utilities,
(d)  promoting energy conservation through pricing and other measures,
(e)  revising the electricity legislation, so as tot
(i)       assign responsibilities for policy formulation, energy
planning and regulating the sector to an Independent
regulatory agency reporting to the President of the Republiet
(i$)      establish the concession regime for the private sector with
defined service responsibilities and cancellation provisions
in case of poor service or other violations of the laws and
regulations; and
liii)     establish clear rules for the calculation of electricity rates
and their and their adjustment as per (c) and (d) above taking
into account inflation, exchange rate variations or other
causes of relevance to energy pricing.
(f)  promoting oil exploration, including the eventual revision of the
corresponding legislation, and
(g) establishing, through the National Commission for the Environment,
appropriate regulations for protecting the environment in all
energy related activities.
