materially related to such Investment Project, the foregoing amount
being subject to change from time to time as determined by the Bank.

withdrawals from the Loan Account in respect of a free-limit
Sub-loan shall contain: (i) a summary description of the Beneficiary
and the Investment Project, including a description of the
expenditures proposed to be financed out of the proceeds of the
Loan, and (ii) the terms and conditions of the Sub-loan, including
the schedule of amortization therefor.
      (c)   Applications and requests made pursuant to the
provisions of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph shall be
presented to the Bank on or before June 30, 1998.
4.    Each Sub-loan shall be: (a) charged interest, on the principal
amount thereof withdrawn and outstanding from time to time, at a
rate determined by the Borrower in accordance with the Credit Policy
Guidelines; and (b) made for a period determined pursuant to the
Credit Policy Guidelines and not exceeding (i) in respect of a Sub-

by other appropriate legal means, rights adequate to protect the
interests of the Bank and the Borrower, including:
      (a)   that each Beneficiary shall undertake to: (i) carry out
and operate the Investment Project with due diligence and efficiency
and in accordance with sound technical, financial and managerial
standards and appropriate safety, health and environmental standards
satisfactory to the Bank, maintain adequate records and provide,
promptly as needed, the funds, facilities and other resources
required for the purpose; (ii) procure the goods and services to be
financed out of the proceeds of the Loan at a reasonable price,
account being taken also of other relevant factors such as time of
delivery and efficiency and reliability of the goods and
availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts therefor,
and, in the case of services, of their quality and the competence of
the parties rendering them, and utilize such goods and services
exclusively in the carrying out of the Investment Project; (iii)
enable the Bank and the Borrower to inspect such goods and the
sites, works, plants and construction included in the Investment
Project, the operation thereof, and any relevant records and
documents; (iv) take out and maintain with responsible insurers such
Page  11
insurance, against such risks and in such amounts, as shall be
consistent with sound business practice, including, without
limitation, such insurance to cover hazards incident to the
acquisition, transportation and delivery of goods financed out of
the proceeds of the Loan to the place of use or installation, any
indemnity thereunder to be made payable in a currency freely usable
by the Beneficiary to replace or repair such goods; and (v) prepare
and furnish to the Borrower for forwarding to the Bank, if so
requested by the Bank, all such information as the Bank or the
Borrower shall reasonably request relating to the foregoing and to
the administration, operations and financial condition of the
Beneficiary and to the benefits to be derived from the Investment
Project; and
      (b)   provisions to ensure the right of the Borrower to
suspend or terminate the right of the Beneficiary to the use of the
proceeds of the Loan upon failure by such Beneficiary to perform its
obligations under its contract providing for the Sub-loan.
