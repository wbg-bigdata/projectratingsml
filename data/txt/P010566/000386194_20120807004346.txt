      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
        This Project Performance Assessment Report, prepared by the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG), evaluates two transport projects, the Gujarat State Highways
Project (2000-07) and the Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project (2001-07),
and a major analytical product for the road sector in India, the Road Transport Service
Efficiency Study (2006).

        The two projects are among twelve state-level transport projects supported by the
Bank in the past fifteen years covering Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh,
Kerala, Mizoram, Punjab, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh. Both the
Gujarat and Karnataka projects involved upgrading, strengthening, and maintenance of
state highways, and institutional strengthening of road sector agencies through technical
assistance. Land acquisition and resettlement issues were important in both projects.

        The two projects were selected for assessment because they had similar objectives
and were implemented in provinces with comparable populations and lengths of highway
networks, though they differed in some respects including institutional capacity, and the
scale of land acquisition and resettlement issues. The Bank‘s task management
responsibilities were managed from the Bank‘s headquarters for the Gujarat project and
from the Bank‘s country office in New Delhi for the Karnataka project. The findings on
sustainability of outcomes from the projects are also likely to be a useful input into the
forthcoming IEG evaluation of sustainable infrastructure services and the World Bank
Group.

        The Road Transport Service Efficiency Study is one of several important
analytical products prepared by the Bank for India‘s transport sector over the last fifteen
years. It directs attention to the importance of addressing regulatory, institutional and
technical issues in improving road transport efficiency as a complement to the large
investments that are being made in the country in developing road infrastructure.

        IEG prepared this report based on an examination of the relevant Project
Appraisal Documents (PADs), Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs),
legal agreements, project files and archives, as well as other relevant reports, documents,
memoranda and working papers. An IEG field mission visited India during November
2011. Discussions were held with Bank staff in Washington, DC and in New Delhi, and
government officials in New Delhi and in Gujarat and Karnataka states. The mission
discussed the projects‘ experience and the effectiveness of Bank assistance with other
stakeholders including road users and project affected persons. Extensive site visits were
undertaken in both the states covering several segments of roads addressed under the two
projects. The visits also covered selected project affected persons as well as structures
that were impacted and rehabilitated by the projects.

       The mission expresses its appreciation for the generous time and attention given
by the Borrower and all concerned parties. A list of persons met by the mission is in
Annex E.

Summary
        This Project Performance Assessment Report assesses the development
effectiveness of two transport projects in India, the Gujarat State Highways Project
(2000-07) and the Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project (2001-07); and a
major analytic product for the country‘s road sector, Road Transport Service Efficiency
Study (2006).

        The objective of the Gujarat project was to ―assist Gujarat in enhancing the state
capacity for effective and efficient road infrastructure planning and management and
maximizing the existing road infrastructure asset utilization through priority investments
and increased funding for maintenance in the road sector.‖ The Karnataka project
objective was ―improving the state‘s core road network.‖ The Road Transport Service
Efficiency Study addressed non-infrastructure factors that impair the efficiency of road
transport services in the country and made recommendations for long-distance passenger
bus services, the trucking industry, and the motor insurance sector.

        Building the institutional capacity of Roads Agencies. The Gujarat Project has
helped the state‘s roads agency (Roads and Building Department) to improve its capacity
for the planning and maintenance of road infrastructure. The progress made in various
aspects of institutional development – planning, procurement, data collection and analysis
using a Road Management System, contract management and quality control, and
environmental and social safeguards – has been largely mainstreamed into the Roads and
Building Department. Administrative efficiency has shown steady and impressive
improvement. Physical targets under the project for road improvement and related
outcomes were achieved in a highly cost-effective and efficient manner and have been
demonstrably sustained beyond project completion. Several state governments and road
agencies have shown interest in learning from Gujarat‘s experience from the project.

        Under the Karnataka project, actions initiated through the Institutional
Development and Strengthening action plan showed mixed results. The capacity of the
Karnataka Public Works Department for contract management improved significantly.
Awareness and capacity for implementing environmental and social safeguards was
enhanced. A Geographic Information System (GIS)-based database for the road network
is now substantially populated and posted on the Public Works Department website.
Greater progress needs to be made in expanding and utilizing this Road Information
System, which is crucial for the systematic planning and management of the state‘s road
network. More progress also needs to be made in e-procurement, human resource
management, and implementation of a revised departmental code. Overall, the gains
made on the institutional front have yet to extend significantly beyond the Project
Implementation Unit to the rest of the Public Works Department at project completion.
The follow-up project, Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project II which
commenced in 2011 builds upon the institutional development and strengthening actions
initiated under this project.

       Sustaining the project-led gains in institutional capacity and road quality.
The improvements in the quality and service outcomes of project roads have been largely
maintained over the last five to seven years in Gujarat, and steadily budgetary provision
                                             x


has been made for their sustainability through periodic maintenance. A road user survey,
as well as feedback to the IEG mission from beneficiaries confirms improvements in road
quality, driving comfort, reduction in travel time, and easier access to services. The
additional provision of service roads in several places has facilitated greater use of
mechanized equipment and easier transportation of agricultural inputs and produce. The
upgrading of priority roads under the project has also increased the state‘s ability to
attract public-private partnership schemes in future road expansion and maintenance. The
project appears to have benefited from state-wide governance initiatives that have had a
mitigating impact on ‗rent-seeking‘ behavior by supervisory staff and staff of central
agencies/departments concerned with permissions and clearances.

          At completion, the Karnataka project‘s outcome targets relating to the quality of
project roads were met. A majority of the project roads display acceptable levels of road
quality in terms of the International Roughness Index. However, 5-7 years after
upgrading/rehabilitation, some of the project roads are beginning to show signs of
distress. Superior planning efforts and adequate maintenance funding will be needed to
prevent further deterioration that may soon require expensive rehabilitation. The study
on the establishment of a Road Fund to ensure long-term availability of funds for road
maintenance was completed as planned and is now being pursued under the follow-on
project launched in 2011. Road safety across the state has improved in terms of accident-
related fatalities per 10,000 registered vehicles during the project period and beyond,
though the gross number of fatalities continues to rise. Institutional improvements –
including capacity for planning, management, and the Road Information System – need
to be consolidated and carried forward. Several of these issues have already been
incorporated in the follow-on project.

        The crucial impact of borrower commitment on project outcomes. The
Gujarat project‘s outcomes have benefited from the state government‘s commitment to
the project and its overall administrative and governance initiatives. With this support,
the Roads and Building Department was able to complete practically all the road works
planned under the project, despite the unprecedented demands placed on it in the
aftermath of a devastating earthquake (2001). The Roads and Buildings Department
leadership also succeeded in fostering a collaborative and productive relationship with
the contractors and engineers.

         The Karnataka project also benefited from government commitment and support.
But project outcomes could have been strengthened through greater support for the
project‘s institutional development goals. Greater coordination between the concerned
state government departments and the implementing agency might have speeded up and
facilitated the process of shifting utilities, land acquisition, and resettlement and
rehabilitation, as well as the pilot initiative on road safety. The implementing agency
could have made greater progress in deploying the Road Information System for
systematic planning and management of the road network. There is scope for
developing a more collaborative relationship with contractors and engineers.

         Value added by the Bank. The Bank‘s support throughout the project in
facilitating the transfer of knowledge are favorably acknowledged by the officials of both
state governments. Discussions with Gujarat‘s Roads and Buildings Department officials
                                             xi


suggest that they see a lot of value in associating with the World Bank as a window to the
latest knowledge and practices in road sector management and the Bank‘s international
experience. The roads agencies in both states credit the Bank with having raised their
awareness and capacity for implementing environmental and social safeguards.

        The initial capacity of the roads agencies in the two states and the different
lengths of exposure to new knowledge and practices through Bank projects (the
Karnataka project was the first dedicated World Bank project for the roads sector in the
state, while the Gujarat project was the second roads sector project in that state) partly
contributed to the relative differences in the outcomes for the two projects. In terms of
Bank supervision, the Gujarat project was managed from the Bank‘s headquarters, while
the Karnataka project was managed primarily from the country office. The locus of
supervision did not appear to make a significant difference in terms of timeliness,
frequency, or quality of interaction with the borrower. However, lending costs were two-
and-a-half times higher for the Gujarat project, partly because of additional work
necessitated by the nearly two-year delay between project appraisal and effectiveness.
Supervision costs for the Gujarat project were higher compared to the Karnataka project
by a margin of 30 percent partly due to higher travel costs.

        The Road Transport Service Efficiency Study addressed selected issues that might
reduce potential benefits to long-distance road transport services in India, from the large
investments being made in the nation's highways. The study made recommendations on
regulatory policy for inter-city passenger transport safety, rationalization of highway toll
rates and taxes, incentives for using multi-axle trucks that would reduce transport costs
and road damage, removing tariff controls, and allowing competition in the motor
insurance sector. Though these issues have been the subject of ongoing policy dialogue
and reports within India, this study aimed to add value through an in-depth study for
selected states, surveys and interviews of key stakeholders, and case studies of China and
Pakistan as comparator countries. Lack of political will at the central and state
government levels remains a barrier to taking tough decisions on the issues addressed by
the study. However, the study remains current in that it has been referenced by some
recent research work and prominent publications.

additional information and analysis from the study is considered satisfactory. The
dissemination and dialogue for the study as well as the results from the study are rated
moderately satisfactory.

Lessons

   The physical and financial sustainability of a road network hinges on the road
    agency‟s capacity to undertake needs-based and timely implementation of road
    improvement and maintenance works. This enables optimal use of available
    funds, and avoids greater costs of repair in the future. Gujarat has been able to
    consolidate its capacity for planning road works to a greater extent than Karnataka,
    and this is reflected in difference in the condition of selected project roads, 5-7 years
    after project completion.

   Institutional and administrative capacity-building should be carried out in step
    with the readiness of the target agency to internalize it. In retrospect, institutional
    reforms in the Karnataka project could have been attempted in a phased and
    incremental manner, allowing time for them to be integrated with wider operations,
    and obtaining the support of key government departments.

   As road agencies evolve from being providers of roads services to „managers‟ of
    increasingly outsourced functions, it is essential that core competencies are
    retained and strengthened to ensure sustainable management of the road
    network. These core competencies cover planning, technical design, road
    management systems, contract management and environmental and social safeguards.

   The roads agency should lead the way in creating a productive working
    relationship with other entities involved in the implementation of roads projects.
    A culture of partnership and cooperation was demonstrated in Gujarat between the
    Roads and Buildings Department, road works contractors and supervising engineers
    which minimized disputes and speeded up implementation.

   Decentralization of the Bank‟s project leadership and supervision does not
    appear to confer any significant advantage over the task leadership based at
    headquarters. Feedback from the road agencies in Gujarat and Karnataka suggests
    that the locus of Bank task management did not make a significant difference in terms
    of response time and attention span.
                                            xiii




   A knowledge product that seeks to cover a subject that has already been well
    studied must provide clear justification of its likely added value. The Road
    Transport Service Efficiency Study added value from surveys and interviews of
    stakeholders and gathering the experience of comparator countries. The study served
    to renew policymakers‘ attention to politically challenging issues facing operators of
    freight trucks and passenger bus services, and the motor insurance sector.

1. Background and Context
1.1      This Project Performance Assessment Report evaluates two transport projects, the
Gujarat State Highways Project (2000-07) and the Karnataka State Highways
Improvement Project (2001-07), and a major analytical product for the road sector in
India, the Road Transport Service Efficiency Study (2006). The two projects were
selected for assessment because they had similar objectives for improving roads and road
sector management, and were implemented in states with comparable populations and
lengths of highway networks. However, they differed in some respects, including
institutional capacity of the roads agencies, the scale of land acquisition, resettlement
issues, and the location of the Bank‘s supervision team (headquarters-based and country-
based, for Gujarat and Karnataka respectively). The findings on sustainability of
outcomes from the projects would also be a useful input into the forthcoming IEG
evaluation of sustainable infrastructure services and the World Bank Group. The Road
Transport Service Efficiency Study is one of several important analytical products
prepared by the Bank for India‘s transport sector over the last fifteen years and sought to
complement the large investments that are being made in the country in developing road
infrastructure.

1.2     Rapid economic growth in India during the last 10-15 years has stimulated an
increasing demand for improving the quality of road infrastructure across the country
including the states of Gujarat and Karnataka. Apart from the national highways and
rural roads, this has brought into focus the shortcomings in quality and capacity of the
existing state highway networks and the several funding and institutional issues that
impede their development.

1.3     With the central Government increasingly focused on national highways and rural
roads, the state highway subsector depends on the state governments for funding the
upkeep of its highways and related institutional development. The larger portion of state
funding, however, goes to rural roads because of the increasing need to address rural
development issues. As a result, state governments have looked to external sources of
funding, and more recently, the private sector, to fund state highways. Apart from the
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Government of Japan have been the
principal sources of external funding for state highways projects.

1.4     India‘s total road network is estimated at 3.3 million kilometers – the third largest
in the world1 – and carried 65 percent of the freight and 80 percent of passenger traffic in
the country in 2010.2 It includes a primary network consisting of national highways, a
secondary network comprising state highways and major and other district roads; there is
also a tertiary network of rural or village roads. In broad terms, the central government is
responsible for the construction and maintenance of National Highways, while the state
and local governments are responsible for the secondary and tertiary networks within
their jurisdictions.

1.5     The national highways account for 2 percent of the country‘s road length and
carried 40 percent of traffic in terms of vehicle-kilometers travelled in the year 2009.
State highways and district roads together form 13 percent of the road network and also
carry 40 percent of the traffic. Rural roads cover the remaining 85 percent of the road
network and serve 20 percent of the traffic.3

1.6     The Gujarat State Highways Project and the Karnataka State Highways
Improvement Project focus on the states‘ secondary road networks, in particular on state
highways. The projects commenced in 2000-01, at a time when both the states were
showing strong economic growth and were facing growing demands for better road
infrastructure.

1.7     Gujarat, located in the west of India, has an area of 196,024 square kilometers and
a population of 60.4 million. An industrially advanced and high growth state, Gujarat
contributes about 7 percent of India‘s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and is considered a
leader in pursuing economic reforms. The state GDP grew at 10.2 percent per annum
during 2002-07, a pace higher than the national average (Table 1). Of the entire country,
Gujarat accounts for 39 percent of total industrial output, 67 percent of petrochemical
production and 20 percent of exports. The state has been pursuing economic reforms
across many sectors, including fiscal policy, power, and education, and private sector
participation in infrastructure. The private sector has played a crucial role in shaping
reforms in various sectors. Gujarat has been a pioneer in complementing these reforms
with better governance initiatives.

1.8     Karnataka, located in the southwest of India, has an area of 191,791 square
kilometers and a population of 61 million. Considered a middle-income state, it has one
of the fastest growing and more vibrant economies in the country. Major contributors to
economic growth in the state are manufacturing and service sectors, accounting for 26
percent and 55 percent of the whole country during the year 2006-07. Karnataka is the
knowledge and technology hub of India, where many domestic and international software
and information technology firms have located in Bengaluru, the capital city. Karnataka‘s
mining and quarrying sector has also enjoyed a boom in recent years due to the increased
global demand for raw materials. However, economic activities are largely concentrated
in a few cities with Bengaluru and Mysore accounting for 37 percent of the State GDP.
Only six out of the 29 districts in the state had a GDP per capita higher than the state‘s
average for 2007-08. Karnataka needs to improve its infrastructure, including roads, if it
is to overcome the existing wide regional economic disparities and make economic
growth more inclusive.

1.9    The length of state highways in the two states is nearly 20,000 kilometers each
(Table 2). The district road network in Gujarat (31,134 km) is about 60 percent of that
of Karnataka (50,037 km). The percentage of state and district roads that are paved in the
two states percent are also significantly higher than the national average of 58 percent. In
Gujarat and Karnataka, only about 16 percent and 8 percent, respectively, of State
Highways and Major District Roads are of two-lane or higher standard.

1.10 In the years leading to approval of the projects, strong economic growth and a
rapid rise in vehicle ownership4 in both states were placing pressure to augment the
existing capacity and quality of their road networks. In the case of primary and tertiary
networks, the situation started to improve after the Government of India introduced two
important programs, the National Highway Development Program in 1998 and the Prime
Minister‘s Rural Roads Program in 2000. These programs, which are partly funded
through the Central Road Fund, have substantially increased the resources allocated for
the improvement of the National Highway and Rural Roads networks in all states,
including Gujarat and Karnataka. In contrast, the secondary network (state highways and
major district roads) continued to suffer from consistent under-funding and weak capacity
of the state road agencies.

 More recently, during 2001-2006, vehicle ownership has grown at an average annual rate of 11 percent,
15 percent and 13 percent in Gujarat, Karnataka, and India, respectively. (Source: National Bureau of
Statistics, India)

1.11 In Gujarat, the World Bank has been involved previously in the roads sector
through the Gujarat Rural Roads Project (1987-1996).5 The Government of Gujarat has
over the years taken several measures to strengthen government policies, institutions and
procedures for better governance that have impacted all sectors including the roads
sector. It has been harnessing information and communication technologies to improve
the efficiency and transparency citizen-based services – notable among these are the
computerization of land records, and state-wide attention on grievances through regular
meetings of administrators at the sub-district, district, and state levels. Simultaneously,
Gujarat has also implemented an Integrated Workflow and Document Management
System for automating government functions and processes. The Roads and Buildings
Department,6 whose responsibilities include managing the state highway network, uses
the e-procurement system in the state for all works valued at higher than US$1 million,
irrespective of the source of funding. According to the Gujarat Vigilance Commission,
procurement-related complaints have decreased significantly with the advent of e-
procurement. Gujarat is also considered to be the first state in the country to have made e-
Governance functional in all its municipalities and municipal Corporations.

1.12 The Government of Karnataka has also adopted reforms to improve the quality of
governance and service delivery that include simplification of procedures and e-
governance, productivity, integrity and accountability in administration and decentralized
and participatory governance. Other reforms have targeted public transport provision and
parking management. Several public sector units have also been privatized or
restructured. The Karnataka Public Works Department is responsible for the state
highways and major district roads.7 It managed the project through a Project
Implementation Unit located within the Public Works Department. Separately, the
Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited, which was established in 2002, is
responsible for the core network outside the scope of externally sourced funds. Thus, the
Public Works Department and the Road Development Corporation are together
responsible for the core road network improvement, and after these works are completed,
the roads are transferred back to the Public Works Department for maintenance.

1.13 The World Bank was in a unique position to respond to the challenges and
opportunities faced by Gujarat and Karnataka in improving their state highway networks
by: (a) providing the critical long-term capital needed to support infrastructure
development for accelerated economic growth, (b) using its lending and advisory
capabilities to leverage the institutional and policy reform process, and (c) ensuring that

6
  The Roads and Buildings Department is in charge of about 74,000 kilometers of roads, including a
number of bridges and besides its responsibilities for public buildings in the state. National highways are
owned and financed by the Government of India‘s Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH);
the Roads and Buildings Department supervises works executed on national highways behalf of the
Ministry. All other categories of roads in the state are owned and financed by GOG, albeit with external
funding assistance in some cases (e.g. in the case of PMGSY funding for rural road improvements).
7
  In addition the Karnataka Public Works Department also looks after National Highways passing through
the state on behalf of Ministry of Road Transport, Government of India. The Public Works Department
manages about 70, 965 kilometers of the road network, excluding national highways.

social and environmental concerns would be fully reflected in project design and
implementation.



2. Gujarat State Highways Project
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
OBJECTIVES

2.1     The project development objective of the Gujarat State Highways Project, as
stated in the Loan Agreement,8 was to ―assist Gujarat in enhancing the state capacity for
effective and efficient road infrastructure planning and management and maximizing the
existing road infrastructure asset utilization through priority investments and increased
funding for maintenance in the road sector.‖

DESIGN

2.2   The planned project cost of US$533 million was to be financed by an IBRD loan
of US$381 million and a counterpart contribution of US$152 million equivalent from the
Government of India. The project consisted of the following components:9

      Component 1: Widening and Strengthening of State Highways (estimated total
       cost: US$415.0 million; actual: US$304.4 million). This component would help
       increase the carrying capacity and structural strength of part of the core state road
       network10 through the widening and strengthening of about 800-900 kilometers of
       high priority state highways.

      Component 2: Land Acquisition and Relocation and Resettlement Expenditures
       (estimated total cost: US$2.0 million; actual: US$8.4 million). This component would
       finance the payments to project-affected persons for the replacement value of assets
       acquired, infrastructure facilities and resettlement sites, Relocation and Resettlement
       entitlements including allowances, training, and monitoring and evaluation
       expenditures. The amount financed would be net of the land acquisition costs and
       cash compensation payable by the state to the project-affected persons under the
       state‘s Land Acquisition Act.

      Component 3: Periodic Maintenance of State Highways (estimated total cost:
       US$68.0 million; actual: US$59.2 million). This component would help reduce the

    The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) has a slightly different wording, but is identical in intent.
9
 The description of the components is slightly different in the Loan Agreement and the Project Appraisal
Document, but overall, there is no material difference. The Loan Agreement version is used here.
10
  The core network is the network of all roads necessary to provide basic connectivity to defined
population centers
                                                     6


     periodic maintenance backlog of the State by funding the overlaying, resealing and
     minor rehabilitation of about 1,000 kilometers of state highways.

    Component 4: Design and Supervision of Civil Works Contracts (estimated total
     cost: US$32.0 million; actual: US$30.8 million). Internationally experienced
     supervision consultants would be procured to supervise the widening and
     strengthening component (Component 1) of the project. They would have full
     responsibility as the "engineer" on site as per International Federation of Consulting
     Engineers11 (FIDIC) conditions. Internationally experienced consultants would be
     used for the techno-economic feasibility and engineering preparation of the project.
     Experienced consultants would also be used for preparation of bid documents and
     oversight of periodic maintenance works.

    Component 5: Institutional Strengthening, Technical Assistance, Training, and
     Equipment (estimated total cost: US$12.0 million; actual: US$5.1 million). This
     component would fund consultant services and technical assistance required to
     implement the Institutional Development Strengthening action plans designed to
     strengthen the Roads and Buildings Department‘s role as the "manager" of Gujarat's
     road network. The training needs envisaged under the Project would focus on the
     planning and management of the state road network with particular emphasis in the
     areas of procurement, construction and maintenance management of the existing
     network. Equipment would be procured under this component for Department‘s
     office and laboratory modernization and road management systems. This component
     would also include the procurement of equipment to monitor pollution and noise
     emissions along main arterial routes.

    Component 6: Pre-investment Studies (estimated total cost: US$4.0 million; actual:
     US$0.48 million). This component would fund the techno-economic feasibility and
     detailed engineering studies required for a possible follow-up project.

2.3     Six earthquake-damaged bridges were added to Component 1(Road Widening and
Strengthening) after the major earthquake that struck Gujarat on January 26, 2001.12 Also
under Component 1, a road length of 22 kilometers was added to one of the contracts
(GSHP-12).13 The fourth annual periodic maintenance program was added to Component
3 (Periodic Maintenance of Highways). All newly-added works were funded from
savings under the project as a result of lower-than-expected civil works unit costs and a
slight depreciation of the Rupee against the US dollar during the early stages of project
implementation.

  The earthquake registered 7.7 on the Richter scale, the second most intense ever recorded in India, killed
nearly 20,000 people, and left 600,000 people homeless (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Gujarat_earthquake,
accessed on April 21, 2012)..
13
  Component 1 was carried out through 14 contracts, GSHP-1 to GSHP-14, covering road segments that
totaled 886 kilometers.

2.4    The Roads and Buildings Department had overall responsibility for project
implementation. A Project Implementation Unit was established to manage project
preparation and implementation activities on a day-to-day basis. The Project
Implementation Unit was headed by a Special Secretary and Chief Engineer assisted by a
number of technical staff. A high level Gujarat Government Tender Committee was
responsible for procurement decisions and for overseeing the approval of civil works and
consultant contracts.

RELEVANCE

2.5     Relevance of the project development objectives is rated High. The objective
was very relevant to the state‘s developmental needs in the roads sector, and was aligned
with the Bank‘s Country Assistance Strategies at project approval (1997; 2001) as well as
the more recent Country Partnership Strategy (2009-12). At approval, the Bank‘s
strategies targeted the reduction of infrastructure constraints for economic growth
through modernizing roads sector institutions; improving asset management performance,
and supporting the state‘s overall socio-economic and development goals. More recently,
through the Country Partnership Strategy, the Bank has emphasized knowledge and
lending solutions that match the needs of a middle-income country/state by promoting
state-level reforms in the road infrastructure sector; mobilizing increased outlays for
investment and maintenance of road infrastructure; and facilitating private sector
involvement in engineering, construction, and maintenance.

2.6    The project‘s objectives were also aligned with the three main drivers of reforms
in Gujarat‘s roads sector since the early 1980s, namely the Gujarat Road Development
Plan (1981-2001); a state cabinet-endorsed ‗state road policy‘ released in 1996; and the
Gujarat Infrastructure Agenda: Vision 2020. The objectives remained highly relevant to
Government of India‘s Tenth and Eleventh Five-Year Plans (2002-2007; 2007-11) which
have emphasized improvements in infrastructure, including improving the quality and
productivity of the transport network for rapid economic growth and poverty reduction.

2.7     Relevance of project design is rated High. The project design appropriately and
comprehensively addressed the state‘s priority needs for improving its core road network.
The two physical components for periodic maintenance, and widening and strengthening
of the state‘s highways, addressed the urgent needs of raising the utilization of prioritized
road segments. This was complemented by a component for land acquisition and
compensation for project-affected persons that precedes the commencement road works.
Because the Roads and Buildings Department was new to implementing the Bank‘s
environmental and social safeguards, this component included training and transfer of
knowledge through consultants.

2.8     The remaining components addressed institutional capacity building across all
key functional areas – planning, roads asset management, technical design, information
systems, procurement, contractor management, and monitoring and evaluation – through
an institutional strengthening action plan. The institutional components fed directly into
the objective of enhancing the capacity for effective road infrastructure planning and
management. The project design has evolved from the Bank‘s wider experience in other
                                                       8


states in India as well as in other countries. Overall, the project‘s design was consistent
with the development objectives.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION DESIGN

2.9     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) design included appropriate indicators for
both parts of the objective. In respect of enhanced effectiveness and efficiency of
planning and management, the project used two outcome indicators for which baseline
data and targets were provided – reduction in the maintenance backlog and the ratio of
administrative cost to capital/maintenance expenditures. Output indicators covered the
implementation of agreed institutional strengthening and modernization action plans and
training about 500 staff of the Roads and Buildings Department through appropriate
training schemes.

2.10 In respect of maximizing asset utilization, the outcome indicators were reduction
in travel time, for which a baseline value and target were provided, and the increase in
road traffic, for which no specific baseline figures were provided. The
output/intermediate outcome indicator was the length of high priority state highways
improved to a ‗good standard‘ International Roughness Index (IRI) less than 4.0
meters/kilometer), for which the default baseline was that none of the roads met this
standard at the start of the project. Two other indicators proposed in the project appraisal
document – economic rate of return, and the level of maintenance funding did not belong
in the M&E design. With hindsight, other intermediate outcome indicators could have
been devised to track capacity-building efforts such as mainstreaming the use of the Road
Management System for planning the department‘s work program as well as prioritized
and need-based deployment of maintenance funds.

Implementation
2.11 Force majeure events caused delay during implementation. Project appraisal
was completed on March 23, 1998, but due to nuclear sanctions against India that
followed soon after14, the project was approved nearly two and an half years later on
September 5, 2000, and became effective on November, 28, 2000. A few months after
the loan became effective, Gujarat was hit by a devastating earthquake that killed 20,000
people and caused extensive damage to the state‘s infrastructure, including roads and
bridges. The loan closing date was extended twice, for twelve months each time, and the
loan finally closed on December 31, 2007. The first extension was to complete work on
the damaged bridges from the earthquake, and the second extension was required because
of the delays in civil works construction caused by the unusually prolonged monsoon
rains in the summers of 2005 and 2006. The 2001 earthquake also delayed the
institutional component, as the Roads and Buildings Department and the state
government had to concentrate on post-earthquake emergency reconstruction of roads
and buildings. The loan‘s two-year extension enabled completion of all the planned civil
works, and implementation of most of the capacity building and institutional
development efforts envisaged at appraisal. The institutional strengthening component
(component 4) used only US$5 million against the planned US$12 million, the rest of the

14
     The sanctions followed soon after India‘s nuclear tests in May 1998.
                                             9


requirements being met through state funds, and also savings from a favorable exchange
rate as well as efficient procurement. In respect of component 6 for pre-investment
studies, only $0.48 million was used during the project against the planned US$4 million.
This was because the studies continued beyond project completion, and the remaining
expenditure was covered by state government as well as the strategic options study for
the proposed follow-up project. An amount of US$101 million of the loan was cancelled
at the request of the borrower in three installments between June 2004 and June 2006.
The delays in implementation of land acquisition and the resettlement action plan pointed
out by the Bank‘s Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA6) after the mid-term review
in March 2002 were satisfactorily resolved by December 2004.

2.12 Project activities were completed at significantly lower than expected costs.
Against an estimated project cost of US$533 million the cost at completion was US$408
million; the Bank loan amount was reduced from US$381 million to US$280 million.
The reduced cost of the project was mostly attributable to: (a) lower-than-expected civil
works costs in part due to significant competitive cost reductions; and (b) depreciation of
the Indian Rupee against the US dollar since project appraisal, which ranged between 10
percent and 25 percent over the project period.

2.13 A collaborative relationship was maintained between the Employer (Roads and
Buildings Department), Engineer and Contractor. Highly professional conduct by the
three contracting parties – the employer (Roads and Buildings Department), the engineers
and the contractors helped in the smooth implementation of road works and minimized
contractual disputes. The project experienced only seven disputes in the fifteen
upgrading works contracts, of which only two cases were referred to arbitration and none
was referred to the court. Only six out of the fifteen upgrading works contracts had an
upward variation order, whereas the remaining nine were completed lower than the
contract prices. The sound collaborative relationship between the different parties was
confirmed by the mission through discussions with representative engineers and
contractors, and Bank staff. They agreed that the state government made a substantial
effort to improve the dispute resolution system and inculcate a culture of cooperation
among the three contractual entities. Mandatory monthly meetings were held between
the Contractor and the Engineer, and payments were processed in a timely manner.
Feedback from interviews suggests that there was active encouragement of dispute
prevention and ‗across the table‘ resolution,

2.14 There was continuity of Staff in both the Bank and Government teams. Most of
the team members from the implementing agency and the Bank remained in place from
project inception and throughout the extended implementation period. This promoted
continuity and rapport in the working relationship between the Bank and the client, while
building strong ownership and commitment to the project among the Roads and Building
Department staff.

SAFEGUARDS

2.15 The project was classified as Category ―B‖ under the Bank‘s environmental and
social safeguards framework and triggered its Environmental Assessment and
Involuntary Resettlement policies. An Environmental Assessment, Environmental
                                                     10


Management Plan, and a Resettlement Action Plan were prepared and disclosed
appropriately to the public as required. Environmental issues that were identified
included: restoration of borrow15 areas; proper disposal of solid and liquid wastes from
construction camps; compensatory planting of trees; proper management of construction
camps and maintenance depots; minimizing dust, accidents and vehicular damage; and
compliance with air, noise, and emission standards. In respect of land acquisition, a key
social issue was to ensure assistance and support to vulnerable and affected squatters and
encroachers in re-establishing their shelter and livelihood opportunities.

2.16 Overall, environmental safeguards were implemented in a satisfactory – and in
many instances – in an exemplary manner. Environmental and forestry clearances were
obtained in a timely manner after discussions and follow-up with the concerned
departmental authorities. More than 8,500 trees were saved by altering the centerline of
the road or cross-section or by retaining them on the edges of embankments.
Compensatory forestation was undertaken by planting two million saplings, as against
165,000 trees that were cut during construction, and the survival rate is reported to be in
an acceptable range, though no specific numbers were available. The mission was shown
sections of compensatory forestation during site visits.

2.17 Compliance reports from the Environmental Management Unit and the Bank‘s
supervision mission confirm that environmental safeguard measures were carried out in a
satisfactory manner. Soil contamination was prevented by providing interceptors, trays,
and sand bed filters that clean the water from the construction sites. Suitable areas for
direct disposal from site were identified with the help of local authorities. Debris was
recycled for construction work, especially asphaltic debris for village roads, access roads,
and low lying commercial and community areas. Local authorities provide support to
Borrow area restoration, clearings site of debris and vegetation, dismantling of
diversions, safe disposal of scarified bituminous surfaces, and the restoration of
demobilized labor camps. Topsoil preservation was carried out through proper stripping
and stacking.

2.18 Apart from planned environmental measures, some additional actions were also
carried out that helped to minimize impacts on endangered animals in a wildlife
sanctuary, and to develop borrow pits as water bodies. Elsewhere, earth from de-silting
and deepening of ponds was used to create 21 mounds that have attracted nesting birds
over the years (Box 1).




15
  ‗Borrow pit‘ is a construction/ civil engineering term used to describe an area where material (usually
soil, gravel or sand) has been dug for use at another location.

      Box 1. Going beyond compliance with Environmental and Social Safeguards in
      Gujarat

      Officials of the Roads and Buildings Department displayed strong commitment to the spirit
      of environmental and social safeguards, and carried out tasks that sometimes went well
      beyond mere compliance.
      An especially noteworthy effort was made on the Viramgam-Halvad corridor, where the
      potential impacts on endangered animals from the nearby Wild Ass Sanctuary were
      minimized by constructing four underpasses to allow the animals access to water sources.
      A ‗food garden‘ of plants favored by the animals was created inside the sanctuary to
      minimize the movement of animals. Elsewhere, earth from de-silting and deepening of
      ponds was used to create 21 mounds that now serve as nesting areas for many important
      migratory and local bird species, including flamingoes, pelicans, herons, storks, cranes, and
      waders. On another count, the project encouraged the development of water bodies in
      borrow areas, an effort that materialized in 125 out of 460 borrow pits. The mission visited
      one such borrow pit converted into a pond near Aithore village, where gently sloping
      extraction of soil has been carried out to prevent soil erosion, and to allow livestock to use
      it as a water source.
      Roads and Buildings Department staff introduced the mission to households of five
      different affected persons and their families in the GSHP 9A segment. These families have
      been given fully constructed houses that are a huge improvement over the makeshift
      shelters used by the families prior to the project. The affected persons appreciated the
      efforts of the Department officers for having successfully managed the sensitive matter of
      integrating them with the existing residents in the area. The mission visited sites where
      small temples that were close to the road were relocated outside of the right-of-way with
      mutual agreement and reconstructed in a nearby accessible place (Samiyala village) or
      relocated and rehabilitated (Siddhpur village). The mission was informed that around 13
      similar places of worship had been relocated during the project with the agreement of the
      local people. On the Mehsana-Palanpur road, a well was retained and the road alignment
      was changed to accommodate local people‘s needs to collect water.

2.19 All required social safeguards actions were satisfactorily completed after
overcoming some delays in the beginning. In the initial project years, 2002-2004, there
were delays in implementing the resettlement action plan, as noted by the Bank‘s mid-
term review, other supervision missions, and a quality of supervision assessment carried
out by the then Quality Assurance Group of the World Bank.16 This was due to delays in
making top-up payments (the difference between replacement cost and compensation
paid under the Land Acquisition Act17) for private land acquisition and providing
permanent resettlement to the displaced households to different extents in the three
phases of road works. This was in turn mainly due to the state government‘s lack of
experience at that time with the Bank‘s safeguard policies, and because practical
standards for payments that conformed to the Bank‘s guidelines had not yet been
established. In response to the Bank‘s assessments, the Environmental Management Unit
within the Roads and Buildings Department developed suitable procedures and held
16
     Quality of Supervision Assessment 6 (QSA6).
17
  The Land Acquisition Act of India, 1894, allows the government to acquire privately held land for public
purposes.
                                                    12


several consultation meetings with all the stakeholders to expedite and complete the
resettlement action plan by December 2004. At the end of the process, land acquisition
for the project (53 hectares) was smaller than had been identified at appraisal (65
hectares). Similarly, 28 percent fewer households were affected than had been anticipated
at appraisal (891 households against 1,253). The lower impacts are due to the efforts
made by the Roads and Buildings Department to explore options to minimize the impacts
through adjustments in the alignments and reducing the corridor of impact width
wherever possible. The final land acquisition and resettlement costs were US$8.4 million,
about four times the estimated at appraisal (US$2 million), but still only about 2 percent
of the final project cost of US$408 million. The land acquisition and resettlement costs
were higher than anticipated due to price increases since appraisal and greater valuation
of compensation requirements realized in practice.

2.20 An independent resettlement impact assessment by a non-governmental
organization, the Rural Development and Management Institute, Ahmedabad, found that
the project has not caused any significant adverse impacts on the livelihoods of affected
persons. Additionally, the study shows that the living and economic conditions of
affected persons have improved. Fifteen families that had lost their homes that ranged
from 8 to 15 square meters in size were provided with larger homes of 20 to 25 square
meters with better water and sanitation facilities, and separate bathrooms and toilets.
Fifty-nine families were entitled to training but twenty of them preferred compensation in
kind such as livestock. Of the families that opted for training, feedback from a sample
size of 60 percent showed that about half the respondents were earning an additional 500-
1000 per month at the end of the project. The post-project average family income for
project affected persons was INR5,380 (US$110) against INR3,661 (U$75) in the base
line and INR4,744 (US$95) for the control group.

2.21 The mission conducted site visits to different segments of road works, and
verified documentation of affected persons, applicable entitlement categories18 for
compensation, and the actual compensation paid. The sites were chosen by the mission
to provide wide coverage, subject to the time available for the visits. 19 Beneficiaries
were chosen by the Roads and Buildings Officials based on reasonable access and
availability. The mission met with beneficiaries with a variety of entitlements, and
received confirmation from th e beneficiaries that they were satisfied with their
settlement, which in some cases exceeded their expectations. One affected person was
below the poverty line with an income of INR 2000 per month (approximately US$40)
when his small roadside business was displaced by the project. He was given Rs. 7000
(approximately US$140) for alternative training in radio and television repair. The
beneficiary reported that his economic situation was better than before displacement. In
the same area, another affected person used to own a roadside bicycle repair shop that
was shifted to the opposite side. He was given formal training for cycle repairs and
continues his business on the other side of the road and supplemented his income by

18
   The entitled categories cover provision of shelter, rental assistance, shifting assistance, vocational
training, and subsistence grants. Each affected person was paid based on applicable categories and eligible
amounts.
19
  The visits covered areas covered by contracts GSHP-1 (Sarkhej – Viramgam); GSHP-6 (Mehsana-
Palanpur); GSHP-8 (Ladvel-Dakor); and GSHP-9 (Vadodara-Jambusar).
                                             13


selling tea and snacks. He also reported that his income improved after rehabilitation
works were completed. The mission visited the households of five different affected
persons and their families in the GSHP 9A segment whose living conditions have also
improved greatly after resettlement (Box 1). Several places of worship that fell in the
right-of-way were handled with sensitivity and relocated with mutual consent and with
improved facilities.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

2.22 Financial management was adequate after experiencing initial problems. The
Roads and Buildings Department was familiar with the Bank's financial reporting,
accounting and auditing requirements from its experience with the Gujarat Rural Roads
Project. The State Highways Project attempted to build upon this by implementing a
computerized Project Financial Management System capable of providing timely and
reliable information to monitor progress in achieving the project‘s objectives. After initial
problems (lags in data entry; lack of compatibility with annual reporting; and excessive
dependence on consultants for data inputs and system operations) the System was
installed at division offices and the central office, and its operation was taken over by
trained finance staff. Financial management arrangements are reported to be
continuously satisfactory from mid-2005 until the loan was closed, and no qualified
audits were reported.

2.23 Procurement of works, goods and equipment, consulting services and training
components was carried out in accordance with the Bank’s guidelines. The widening
and strengthening of civil works were procured through international competitive bidding
and implemented in three phases, with the majority of contracts in packages of US$10-40
million. The bidders for these civil works were pre-qualified in accordance with Bank
guidelines. The periodic maintenance of civil works was procured through national
competitive bidding in packages of US$1-5 million. The Roads and Building Department
performed its procurement role efficiently and proved proficient in preparing tenders,
evaluating bids, and awarding contracts. The upgrading works contracts were signed at an
overall 18 percent lower price than the estimated costs, a significant measure of the
project‘s procurement efficiency. Moreover, only six of the fifteen upgrading works
contracts had an upward variation in contract price during implementation, whereas the
remaining nine have been completed at lower than contract price, reflecting adoption of
efficient contract management and cost control measures during implementation.

Achievement of the Objectives
2.24 This report assesses the two major outcomes pointed to in the statement of
objectives: (1) "to enhance the capacity of Government of Gujarat for the effective and
efficient planning and management of road infrastructure", and (2) "maximize existing
road infrastructure asset utilization " (outcomes in italics). The outcome indicators for
part (1) are to reduce the ratio of administrative cost to capital/maintenance expenditures
by 10 percent by the end of the project and to achieve an International Roughness Index
(IRI) <4 meters/kilometer on project roads. The outcome indicators for part (2) of the
PDO were reduction of travel time (10 percent for the 1,900 kilometers of roads covered
by the project), and reduction in maintenance backlog (20 percent on all state highways.)

ENHANCING THE STATE‟S CAPACITY FOR EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT ROAD
INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT. Rated High.

2.25 The objective of enhancing the state‘s capacity for road sector management was
pursued mainly through the Institutional Strengthening Action Plan, (i) moving towards a
‗whole-of-network‘ approach to monitoring and planning for roads development and
maintenance; (ii) strategic organizational changes and newly defined responsibilities
including a policy and planning function; (iii) initiating systematic road condition data
collection and information technology-based tools for maintenance planning and
programming; (iv) improving capacity for environmental and social safeguard
compliance through a new environmental management unit; (v) enhancement of the
Roads and Buildings Department‘s financial management capabilities with the
operational Project Financial Management System; (vi) greater provision for training for
Roads and Buildings Department officers; and (vii) preparation of procedure manuals20 to
streamline standards and procedures.

2.26 The project has helped the Roads and Buildings Department to lay greater
emphasis on road network management, planning and policy as compared to its focus on
traditional execution of civil works. The project succeeded in meeting or exceeding most
of its key output targets and performance indicators with respect to physical road works
as well as in building institutional capacity.

2.27 Outputs. A Policy and Planning Unit was set up in the Roads and Buildings
Department with the responsibility for preparing annual budget plans for the department
by using a computer-based Gujarat Road Management system. A Highway Design Unit
was also created. The Department benefited from working with experienced international
consultants through transfer of knowledge and skills in technical and procurement
matters, and in the management of consultants and civil works contracts.

2.28 The Gujarat Road Management System is a complex system consisting of several
modules/systems that need to be continually populated with data. The Road Information
System, which defines the nodes and links of the network and basic road characteristics
had gathered this data for the state‘s highways and district roads at project completion,
and is presently in an advanced stage of covering rural roads. The Pavement
Management System is designed for technical and financial analyses for multi-year road
work‘s programming and optimization under budget constraints. and is being used for
the Roads and Building Department‘s annual and five year plans. The Bridge
Management System is geared towards preventive maintenance of bridges, and is
presently in the form of a catalogue of bridge condition with photographs. The system
continues to be populated with more details to improve its utility. The Traffic Information
System is fully functional and is being used as intended to produce forecasts of average
annual traffic. Axle-load data and origin-destination data are collected intermittently by
the Traffic Information System in the course of preparing projects. The Environment and
Social Information System has been populated, but more attention and resources need to

be committed for use as necessary when new projects are initiated. The Budgeting and
Programming System is set up to use Highway Design and Maintenance software (HDM-
4) to prioritize expenditures and generate a multi-year works programs, or using a
decision-tree method to generate a one-year works program. The Routine Maintenance
Management System is designed to improve the quality of routine maintenance through
standardization of activities, and its impact on efficient expenditure on routine
maintenance in the process of filtering to the level of field offices. The Accident
Information System requires greater coordination with the police department. The
effectiveness of the Monitoring and Evaluation System relies on regular updating of data,
and more incentives need to be created for field officers to enter details into the system
on a periodic basis.

2.29 Several Roads and Bridge Department staff were trained on road management
systems. Some of these staff supervise external consultants on the Road Management
System while senior officers provide overall guidance.

2.30 The project helped to refurbish and strengthen the Staff Training College,21 which
imparts training to state public works engineering staff, in terms of physical and
professional resources. An annually updated three-year rolling training program was
launched. A multi-phase manager development program was initiated for middle-level
staff for the new and evolving responsibilities in Gujarat‘s road sector environment.
Overall, over 1, 500 Roads and Bridges Department staff, representing over 75 percent of
the professional staff were trained during the project‘s lifetime, exceeding the target of
500. The training covered contract management/procurement, monitoring and
evaluation, environmental and social safeguards functions and management, project
management, planning, finance, quality control/management, and, more recently, e-
procurement/e-governance. The pace of training is being sustained because of the
general emphasis placed on training by the state government through mandating that 1.5
percent of a department‘s budget be set apart for this purpose, which is considered a
unique development among Indian states.

2.31 A Human Resource Development post was created in the Roads and Bridges
Department. These duties are presently assumed by the Chief Engineer in the project
implementation unit, assisted by the Staff Training College. A number of initiatives have
resulted from this collaboration but progress needs to be made in preparing job
specification/descriptions as a pre-cursor to performance appraisal, career planning and
programs for training and development.

2.32 Much of the gains in capacity-building have been sustained through ensuring
continuity of trained and experienced staff in the project implementation unit. While
staff has been rotated since the project closed due to the relatively lower scale of activity,
staff with experience in the key planning, design, and safeguards functions has been
retained at appropriate levels. The policy and planning work is gradually being
outsourced. These functions are supervised at the level of the Chief Engineer in the
Project Implementation Unit.

21
   The mission, activities, and achievements of the Staff Training College are provided in their website
(stc.gujarat.gov.in), though website requires to be updated.

2.33 The Environmental Management Unit was staffed adequately and performed well
during the project. A state-wide ‗Social and Environment Management Policy and
Guidance‘ was prepared under the project, and is now applied to all investment projects
undertaken by the Roads and Buildings Department. Presently, the environmental and
safeguards function is undertaken by officers in addition to other duties, and is overseen
at the Chief Engineer‘s level. The bulk of the environmental and social safeguards work
has been now outsourced as part of feasibility and design work for new projects.

2.34 Outcomes. The Project Planning Unit set up under the project functioned well
during the project period and was able to prepare subsequent budget plans for 2007 and
2008 based on the computer-based Gujarat Road Management system. This is a
significant achievement for effective and efficient road planning and management,
compared to the past practice by which all the budget plans were prepared manually, with
less emphasis on data support and analysis.

2.35 The Roads and Buildings Department displayed an impressive and consistent
increase in administrative efficiency during the project period and beyond. The
administrative cost in the capital maintenance and maintenance budget was reduced by
almost half from 30 percent at project approval to 15.7 percent at project completion.
The figure for 2011 shows a further decrease to 11.5 percent22 indicating an impressive
and continued improvement in administrative efficiency beyond the project. Interviews
conducted during the mission suggest that the increased administrative efficiency can be
attributed partly to the capacity improvement during the project, apart from the financial
discipline maintained by the Roads and Building Department as well as state government
oversight. While the Roads and Buildings Department‘s work program and budget have
grown manifold since the beginning of the project, there has also been a steady decline in
the numbers of both professional and casual workers. The number of professional
workers has declined from 11,075 in 2004 to 9,381 in 2010, and the number of casual
laborers declined from 10,621 in 2000 to 8,338 in 2010. These numbers are seen as
another indicator of an overall increase in agency‘s administrative efficiency, although to
some extent it also reflects the outsourcing of some functions.

2.36 According to the presentation given to the mission, the core modules of the
Gujarat Road Management System – Road Management System, Pavement Management
System, and the Budgeting and Programming System – are operational. The Pavement
Management System is being used for the Roads and Building Department‘s annual and
five year plans. Together with inputs from the Traffic Information system, these systems
are used to produce a prioritized program of works, subject to budget constraints. It
already provides a stronger basis for making budget estimates for maintenance funding
and conducting constructive dialogue with the state‘s finance department. An example of
road condition data collected by the Road Management System for several road segments
(including some visited by the mission) are given below in Table 3. Currently, a
prioritized program of works is produced annually, using available road condition data
and different budget assumptions. This approach has helped to prioritize and commit

 For the financial year 2011, the administrative cost of Roads and Buildings Department was Rs. 5760
million against a capital/maintenance expenditure was Rs. 45050 million. (Source: Roads and Buildings
Department)

resources to roads based on traffic growth and other relevant parameters. Officials also
cite a request from the ministerial level for road condition data underpinning budget
estimates, which is unprecedented. Taking all these aspects into consideration, IEG‘s
assessment is that the component systems of the Road Management System are being
mainstreamed into the management of the road network in Gujarat.

2.37 Gujarat achieved strong results in reducing the maintenance backlog for state
highways during the project and has kept up this trend in the years after project
completion. The maintenance backlog for state highways was halved from 10,000
kilometers at the start of the project to 5,000 kilometers at project completion, including a
contribution of 1,900 kilometers reduction by the project. More recent figures confirm
that as of 2010, 1,700 kilometers of state highways were pending for maintenance
(resurfacing). Against that figure, 1,290 kilometers were resurfaced in 2011.

2.38 Other outcomes. There has been a high degree of interest shown by other states
to learn from various aspects of Gujarat‘s experience in the roads sector. In this
connection, Roads and Buildings Department has received visits from road sector
officials (and in a few cases, political leaders) from the states of Maharashtra, Kerala,
Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Orissa, and Bihar. Visits from Chhattisgarh and Assam were
arranged by the Bank‘s task team.

2.39 Outputs. Priority investments for the road infrastructure asset base were chosen
through the 'whole-of-network' approach of monitoring and planning. The targets for

upgrading and rehabilitating roads were met or exceeded (nearly 900 kilometers
upgraded against a target of 873 kilometers and about 1,000 kilometers
improved/widened as targeted).

2.40 In nominal terms, the budget allocation for routine and periodic maintenance
almost doubled between 2001-02 and 2008-09, through this increase may be smaller in
real terms. (Table 4). Feedback from Roads and Buildings Department officials suggests
that the government is in a position to meet the estimated budget needs for routine and
periodic road maintenance. With the goal of securing long term sustainability of road
maintenance financing, the task of establishing a Road Fund23 had been included in the
Institutional Action Plan of the project. However, the increasing availability of funds
from state, national and private sector sources in successive years has shifted the focus
from building a consensus on the Road Fund. However, given the continued strong
demand for road infrastructure development and extension in the state, the issue of the
Gujarat Road Fund has been included in the new Vision 2020 document of the state
government. The outlay for routine and periodic maintenance has increased consistently
in nominal terms from 2001-02 to 2008-09.

2.41 Outcomes. The quality of project roads has been maintained at a ‗good‘ quality
(IRI < 4.0 meter/kilometer). The average car/truck/bus speed increased from 50 km/h to
60 km/hour on project roads implying a reduction in travel time of 16 percent. Traffic
growth on roads that received periodic maintenance averaged 6.3 percent annual growth
during the four-year period after completion of works. For roads that were widened and
upgraded, the average growth in traffic ranged between 1 percent to over 10 percent in
the first three years after construction.

2.42 The mission selected four contracts for site visits out of fourteen in the project, to
make a balanced assessment of the current status of project roads. The sites were
selected to provide wide regional coverage subject to time available. The contract sites
were Sarkhej-Viramgam (GSHP-1; 47.5 km); Mehsana-Palanpur (GSHP-6; 55.4 km);
Ladvel- Dakor (GSHP-8; 63.7 km); and Vadodara-Jambusar (Contracts GSHP 9A; 9B;
92.8km). In general all the road segments that were visited displayed good surface and

earmarked tax revenues, and overseen by an independent Road Fund Board.
                                             19


riding quality. In most cases, the shoulders have been kept clear, and vegetation growth
on the sides of the roads has been managed well. Road signs and markings in most cases
are clear and visible, though they are showing signs of wear in a few spots. This points to
good construction quality and attention to proper drainage.

2.43 Prior to the implementation of the project, a survey conducted on the roads
subject to periodic maintenance showed that the roughness of the pavement was in the
range of International Roughness Index (IRI) 6 to 20 meters/kilometer and on roads
subject to widening and strengthening it was at 6.5. The desirable level is 4.0
meters/kilometer or lower. After the completion of the project the roughness was
recorded at about International Roughness Index (IRI) 4 meters/kilometers on roads
which received periodic maintenance, and International Roughness Index (IRI) 1.5-2.2
meters/kilometers on roads which were widened and strengthened. The latest figures for
several road segments covered by the project show an International Roughness Index
(IRI) less than 4.0 for most segments. (Table 4).

2.44 Reduction in travel time. After the completion of periodic maintenance on the
roads, the following average speed of travel was recorded: 50 km/h (against 35 km/h on
the roads in their pre-project condition) on the 1st– and 2nd-year roads, and 60 km/h
(against 40 km/h on the roads in their pre-project condition) on the 3rd– and 4th-year
roads. This implies that travel time of the road users has been reduced by 30 percent on
the 1st and 2nd-year roads and 33 percent on 3rd and 4th-year roads. The average speed
of light motor vehicles on roads improved under the Widening and Strengthening
Component was recorded in the range of 60-65 km/h and on some clear straight stretches
cars can achieve a speed of 80-100 km/h. This contrasts with 35-40 km/h prior to the
project, and sometimes 20 km/h on several severely deteriorated road stretches. Though
no speed measurements have been made of heavy vehicles on the roads under either
project component, the observations of the Roads and Buildings Department‘s engineers
indicate that heavy vehicles are also able to cruise at higher speeds than before, staying in
the left-hand lane and allowing more overtaking opportunities for faster light vehicles.
The traffic count surveys conducted on the roads have recorded the average annual
growth rate of 6 percent on the roads that received periodic maintenance. The survey
conducted on the roads improved under the Widening and Strengthening Component also
showed traffic growth, which was significant on some roads and moderate on others. No
systematic compilation of data is available for travel times on project roads since project
completion. The mission‘s conversations with roads users during site visits confirmed
that travel times have reduced considerably since the road improvements have been
completed. A typical piece of anecdotal evidence comes from truck drivers using the
Mehsana-Palanpur road. They indicated that a stretch of this road that took about two
and an half hours to cover before upgradation now takes a little over an hour.

2.45 Other outcomes. The improved quality of project roads has created a demand
from other quarters of the state for roads of similar quality. There are signs that local
politicians are responding to this demand. Feedback from interviews with officers of
Roads and Building Department suggests that experience with the State Highway Project
may have influenced the adoption of the 10 meter road width standard for the state
government‘s program for state highways, the Pragati PathYojana, for nine-high speed
                                                     20


corridors to connect tribal, coastal, industrial, and rural areas with mainstream areas,
The project has helped improve port connectivity (Annex B Table 2).

2.46 Another major outcome has been to develop the capacity of contractors by an
order of magnitude. Packaging of works in variable sizes has helped develop industry
capacity by providing opportunities to all categories of contractors, including local
contractors, and enabling contactors to graduate to larger contracts from satisfactory
execution of smaller ones. The project helped contractors to invest in advanced
equipment, and avail of expertise and training from the project‘s expert consultants and
Roads and Bridges Department staff. Several contractors have grown from handling
contracts of between INR10-80 million to contracts of INR 250-1000 million.

2.47 The improved quality of roads under the project increases the scope for attracting
private sector interest in public private partnerships in the provision of road
infrastructure. This can potentially result in greater efficiency and the inflow of private
investment can reduce the pressure on the government‘s resources, which can then be
directed towards improving roads that have less potential for public private partnerships.

2.48 Gujarat has seen a steady growth in vehicle ownership in the ten years after
project effectiveness, with the number of vehicles more than doubling during the period.
In absolute terms, road-linked fatalities per capita have increased over the same period by
42 percent. In both these respects Gujarat has mirrored the experience for all of India.
However, in terms of fatalities per 10,000 vehicles, Gujarat‘s performance as of 2010
(6.32) is significantly better than for India as whole (10.6). (Table 5).

2.49 A road user satisfaction survey administered at the end of the project to people in
four sectors – agriculture, education, health and business showed a variety of benefits
arising from more comfortable driving conditions, higher speed, reduction in travel time
and costs, and increased availability of commercial vehicles. These benefits included:
                                            21


increased use of mechanized equipment for cultivation and easier transportation of
agricultural inputs; easier access to raw materials; improved access to preventive and
health care facilities.

2.50 Senior officers of the Roads and Buildings Department who worked on the project
told the mission that the Bank had added a ―lot of value‖ to their understanding and
implementation of safeguard polices for environmental and social management.
Similarly, several PIU field staff that the IEG mission met during site visits
acknowledged their increased awareness and understanding of the need for complying
with environmental and social safeguards. WB‘s task team and especially its social and
environmental staff came in for praise from Roads and Buildings Department officials for
their persistent efforts in overcoming initial skepticism and reluctance among Roads and
Buildings Department staff as well as contractors and engineers towards safeguard
policies, and ultimately ensuring that the policies were implemented in letter and spirit.
Similarly, contractors with whom the mission had discussions acknowledged that the
Bank‘s safeguard specialists and Roads and Buildings Department staff helped to raise
their awareness in this respect. All parties felt that safeguards provisions were being
mainstreamed into their regular work.


Efficiency
2.51 The efficiency of the project in meeting its objectives is rated High. The
combined economic rate of return (ERR) for the first two project components (Widening
and Strengthening, and Maintenance) was estimated at appraisal at 44 percent, with a net
present value of $838 million (equivalent to $1,066 million at 2007 prices), while the
revised ERR at the completion of the project was 57 percent, with a net present value of
$1,107 million at 2007 prices. The benefits from the institutional strengthening
component were difficult to quantify, and hence were not included in the economic
evaluation of the project at either appraisal or completion. However, both the
environmental mitigation measures and relocation and resettlement costs were fully
incorporated in the calculation of the ERRs at appraisal and completion for component 1
(Widening and Strengthening). Overall, the economic analysis carried out at project
completion used assumptions similar to that at project appraisal.

2.52 The higher than expected ERR at project completion was due to the increase in
benefits from higher than expected traffic growth, and significant cost reduction in
Component 1 (road widening and strengthening). Traffic growth on roads that received
periodic maintenance averaged 6.3 percent annual growth during the four-year period
after completion of works. For roads that were widened and upgraded, the average
growth in traffic ranged between 1 percent to over 10 percent in the first three years after
construction. At project appraisal, an average growth rate of between 4 and 11 percent
was forecast for all projects in the initial year, which was expected to remain below an
average annual increase of 8 percent during 2002-7, and stabilize thereafter. Apart from
the favorable exchange rate during the early years of the project, the cost reduction was
achieved by the state government‘s commitment to reducing costs through making robust
cost estimates, developing a highly competitive market for contractors, tight management
                                             22


of contracts by the Roads and Buildings Department, as well as robust oversight by the
Finance Department.

2.53 The design and supervision of civil works as well as the institutional
strengthening and technical assistance tasks were carried out within the range of costs
estimated at appraisal. In terms of time, practically all institutional development activities
were either completed or well advanced at project completion, and in many cases carried
forward beyond that stage.

Ratings
OUTCOME

2.54 Overall project outcome is rated Highly Satisfactory. The project objectives in
respect of both physical improvements of roads as well as institutional development were
appropriate to the needs of the state‘s roads sector. The project design was robust and
realistic in taking into account the state‘s commitment to the project and its institutional
endowments. Most outputs of the complex institutional strengthening and development
plan were completed resulting in strong outcomes including a reduction in road
maintenance backlog and improvement in administrative efficiency. The physical
objectives of the project were achieved in terms of upgradation, rehabilitation and
maintenance. Major outcomes of road quality including reduction in the roughness index
and travel time were achieved. Efficiency of the project was high in terms of the high
economic rates of return and cost savings of about 18 percent in physical works. Based
on High relevance of the objectives and High relevance of design, and High achievement
of both objectives, and High efficiency, the overall outcome of the project is rated Highly
Satisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

2.55 The risk that the achieved development outcomes will not be sustained is rated
Negligible to Low. The state government and the implementing agency, the Roads and
Building Department, continue to display strong commitment to the development of the
roads sector. At the government level, this is reflected in the important role for roads and
highways in the Gujarat Infrastructure Agenda: Vision 2020. The government‘s
commitment is also reflected in the steady increase in funds for the roads sector over the
years (Table 6) as well as the funds for periodic and routine maintenance in particular
(Table 4). The Roads and Buildings Department has also maintained continuity in areas
of institutional improvement including planning, procurement and contractor
management. The gains from improvement in environmental and social safeguards
management have been mainstreamed into the implementing agency. Furthermore,
structure and processes for overall public sector governance and more particularly in the
road sector have continued beyond the project period.

2.56 The gains in institutional capacity from the project have been sustained due to the
broad continuity in the composition of the project implementation unit beyond the project
and provision and an orderly rotation of staff since project completion. From the
mission‘s discussions with the Roads and Buildings Department officials, engineering
                                                     23


consultancy firms and contractors, the knowledge and experience gained from the project
has been mainstreamed in the implementing agency. This track record provides a good
basis to the ongoing efforts in the institutional capacity building and sustainability agenda
for the roads sector.

2.57 The implementing agency has also demonstrated a high level of commitment and
ownership by launching a long term financing options study, using its own resources.

BANK PERFORMANCE

Quality at Entry

2.58 The quality at entry for the project is rated Satisfactory. At the identification and
preparation stages, the Bank‘s team collaborated productively with the state
government‘s proactive project preparation activities at entry. The task team took care to
conduct careful and thorough preparatory work particularly because this was the Bank's
first highway sector project in Gujarat. The project design applied lessons from other
states of India and other countries in the region, and made a detailed review of the
engineering aspects of the physical components, environmental and social factors, and
financial management. Emphasis was placed on encouraging competitive tendering and
improving procurement and governance practices. Much time was spent on ensuring
robust and realistic cost estimates for civil works in coordination with the implementing
agency. M&E design was adequate and provided appropriate outcome indicators for both
the objectives of the project.

2.59 This was the second Bank-financed transport project in the State after the Gujarat
Rural Road project (1987-1996) and built upon that prior experience, including lessons
from IEG‘s performance assessment of that operation (IEG 1996). Preparation of the
project also benefited from technical assistance through the States' Road Infrastructure
                                                   24


Development Technical Assistance Project (1991-1996).24 The key lessons that were
taken into account from these and other relevant projects included early attention to
comprehensive planning; institutional strengthening measures; procurement actions;
inter-agency coordination and ownership; full site preparation; and the integration of
environmental management in project planning and design.

2.60 The project was prepared in a participatory manner with several workshops and
discussions that brought together all relevant stakeholders. An important aspect of these
consultations was to facilitate the formulation of the Institutional Strengthening Action
Plan (ISAP) to help the transformation of the Roads and Buildings Department from a
―provider‖ of services to a ―manager‖ of road infrastructure. The main risk perceived
risk at appraisal was that inadequate maintenance funding might impede efforts to reduce
the maintenance backlog. In practice, the state government fulfilled its commitment to
increase maintenance funding by significant increments annually throughout the project
period and beyond.

Quality of Supervision

2.61 The Bank’s quality of supervision during the project is rated Satisfactory. The
Bank‘s supervision missions were carried out at regular and frequent intervals and fielded
teams with a good skill mix. There were 17 supervision missions between FY2001 and
FY2007, facilitating frequent interaction and detailed attention to issues. Many Bank
team members remained associated with the project throughout its implementation and
were fully aware of the project history and the capacity of the implementing agency,
allowing them to provide quick and appropriate advice.

2.62 The mid-term review in 2002 discussed the qualitative aspects of performance,
making allowance for the delays in physical works caused by the major earthquake of
2001. However, the deviation from the intermediate targets for end-2002 was not clearly
assessed by the mid-term review mission.

2.63 The Quality of Supervision Assessment conducted by the Bank‘s Quality
Assurance Group in August 200425 rated the overall quality of supervision as moderately
satisfactory. It rated procurement, financial management, legal and environmental
aspects as satisfactory. However, due to persistent problems of compliance with the
resettlement action plan since May 2004, supervision of social aspects of the project was
rated moderately unsatisfactory. In response, the Bank‘s team quickly improved its
support to solve this problem, and compliance with social safeguard policies was fully
achieved by December 2004, thanks to repeated consultation meetings with the
stakeholders. In their feedback to the mission, Roads and Building Department officials
also noted the important role played by the Bank‘s safeguards specialists in raising

24
  The objective of the States' Road Infrastructure Development Technical Assistance Project was to assist
sixteen participating states including Gujarat and Karnataka in the preparation of high priority road
investments aimed at Bank financing, while promoting policy reforms in the provision, financing and
maintenance of road infrastructure. This project, too, was the subject of an IEG Performance Assessment.

awareness of safeguard issues in the implementing agency and their guidance and
persistence in ensuring that environmental and social measures were carried out in a
satisfactory manner.

2.64 Feedback to the mission from Roads and Buildings Department staff and
management indicates that World Bank staff was generally open-minded, helpful and
flexible, and balanced local conditions with solutions that were based on experience in
other countries. For instance, the Bank originally favored large contract packages to
attract capable contractors. The Roads and Building Department considered the packages
too small to attract international bidders and too large for local contractors. In the case of
one large package, only five contractors were prequalified, and the lowest bid was 27
percent higher than the engineer‘s estimate, with an overall spread of 2 percent between
the bids. The Bank agreed with the Roads and Building Department‘s suggestion that
the contract be split and re-bid. The smaller contracts were won by contractors who had
not been able to prequalify earlier, and the job was finally completed at less than the
engineer‘s estimates.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

Government Performance

2.65 The Gujarat government’s performance is rated Highly Satisfactory. The state
government committed substantial resources ($7 million) for project preparation under
the States' Road Infrastructure Development Technical Assistance Project (1991-1996),
without any assurance at that time that the project would go ahead. The state government
also funded the pre-feasibility study focusing on the investment needs of the core state
highway network in 1994 and the preparation of the Strategic Options Study to identify
roads for improvement. During project implementation, the government‘s close
monitoring of the procurement process and expenditures helped to avoid any cost-
overruns and also contributed to substantial project savings. The Finance Department
consistently followed up with the Roads and Buildings Department to provide
justification for expenses. Throughout the project there was active involvement of and
access to the Roads and Bridges Department executive and senior officers of the Gujarat
state government.

2.66 Overall, the state government sustained a high degree of readiness and
commitment to begin implementing certain preparatory activities (such as studies,
designs; and required clearances) from prior to the project launch, regardless of the two-
year delay in loan negotiations and approval. The project stayed on track and did not
require restructuring despite the two-year suspension due to nuclear sanctions beginning
June 1998, and the devastating earthquake of 2001. During the project, there was a
generally cooperative relationship between the various governmental stakeholders
including the forestry department, utility agencies, and the finance department, and
realistic work plan targets were established for each entity.

2.67 A recently published assessment of the Gujarat road sector suggests that the
project benefited from improved processes to mitigate the ‗rent-seeking‘ behaviors of
supervisory staff and staff of central agencies/departments that are involved with
                                            26


permissions, approvals, and payments (Bandyopadhyay and Stankevich 2011). Among
these features was the use of e-procurement for contracts greater than INR 1 million
(approximately US$20,000) irrespective of source of funding, as required by the state
government. According to the Gujarat Vigilance Commission, a government body that
investigates corruption charges, procurement related complaints have generally decreased
with the advent of e-procurement including for the roads sector. Gujarat has also
implemented an on-line mechanism for release of sanctioned funds up to the level of field
officers, avoiding delays and difficulties in timely disbursement of contractor‘s bills and
discharging other financial commitments. Key management mechanisms that provide
scope for greater accountability and control, including the Integrated Workflow and
Document Management System (IWDMS), provided accessible, transparent information
on the state of progress and are being used to pinpoint the sources of delay. The state
government‘s policy of generally keeping staff for at least three years in professional,
technical and administrative positions before being rotated to other positions is a positive
factor worthy of emulation in other Indian states and elsewhere.

Implementing Agency Performance

2.68 Implementing agency performance during the project is rated Highly
Satisfactory. The implementing agency – the Roads and Buildings Department –
managed the project in a professional manner, paying attention to quality and costs. The
Roads and Buildings Department benefited from strong and committed leadership and
support from the relevant government departments. Continuity of staff postings in the
Roads and Buildings Department was a positive contributory factor to the outcomes of
the project. The agency was proactive in making arrangements during project
preparation, including the timely completion of studies and designs. Careful design and
cost review at the pre-bidding stage helped to lower the costs of road works. Strong
contract management was demonstrated by the Roads and Buildings Department and
helped to minimize delays and keep implementation within the contractually stipulated
time-frame. The agency also succeeded in fostering a collaborative and productive
relationship with the contractors and engineers, which was reflected in the smooth
implementation of road works and minimal contractual disputes.

2.69 The project paid due attention to environmental management during planning and
implementation. Good practices were followed for public involvement and consultation.
The state government showed commitment to implementing environmental and social
safeguards policies by setting up an Environmental Management Unit in the Roads and
Buildings Department headed by a Superintending Engineer and staffed by
environmental and social safeguard staff who worked with the engineers and contractors.
During the project period, this arrangement helped coordination with Bank missions on
safeguards issues, enforcement of agreed measures, and follow-up on pending issues.
The Environmental Management Unit prepared and delivered training for consultants,
contractors and Roads and Buildings Department field staff, through workshops as well
as field-based exercises. Environmental Management was also included as a separate
training module in the Staff Training College.

2.70 The Roads and Buildings Department showed its commitment to addressing
environmental and social issues through the successful establishment of the
                                             27


Environmental Management Unit which proved to be a well-managed project-level
institutional arrangement. The Environmental Management Unit conducted supervision
and monitoring of safeguards measures and established an acceptable supervision and
reporting system for the purpose. The Environmental Management Unit pursued forestry
and environmental clearances in consultation with relevant agencies and successfully
collaborated with the concerned departments. The project followed a policy of retaining
non-interest bearing sums of money from contract payments as a disincentive to
contractors against non-compliance with contract clauses for environmental safeguards.
A coordination mechanism was developed between the Roads and Buildings Department
and the forestry department through the Environmental Management Unit. Overall, the
creation of Environmental Management Unit worked well in implementing safeguards
requirements during the project and this arrangement may be considered for other states
in India with similar projects and safeguards issues.

2.71 Over the project period, the Roads and Buildings Department enhanced its
capacity for construction supervision and gained confidence in managing and taking
ownership of the road network. The mission‘s discussions with Project Implementation
Unit and other Roads and Buildings Department staff indicated that the learning and
experience from the project has had a positive learning impact on Department staff
beyond the Project Implementation Unit.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

2.72 M&E Implementation. The mid-term review in 2002 discussed the qualitative
aspects of performance, making allowance for the delays in physical works caused by the
major earthquake of 2001. However, the deviation from the intermediate targets for end-
2002 was not clearly assessed by the mid-term review mission. The Roads and Buildings
Department began collecting data on performance indicators in 2004 and the findings
were discussed with the Bank team periodically from December 2004 onwards. A series
of Performance Assessment and Beneficiary Surveys was conducted by the Roads and
Buildings Department in November 2005 and December 2007, which provided feedback
on road quality, performance, and road user satisfaction.

2.73 M&E Utilization. Discussions with the Roads and Buildings Department
officials and task team members suggest that qualitative and quantitative data from
periodic progress reports were used to track progress of project activities and to take
measures to speed up implementation. Beginning in 2004, data for performance
indicators provided feedback on outputs and outcomes and served the purpose of a
feedback mechanism. Overall, the Quality of M&E is rated Substantial.

3. Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
OBJECTIVES

3.1     The overall project development objective, as expressed in the Loan Agreement
and the Project Appraisal Document, was to assist Karnataka in ―improving its core road
network.‖ This statement of objectives does not explicitly point to the anticipated
outcomes associated with the road network improvements, but the subsequent text in the
Project Appraisal Document lists three specific outcomes to meet the development
objective: enhancing the capacity and quality of the core state highway network; more
efficient and effective network management, and delivery of road infrastructure services
(World Bank 2001b, p. 2).26 and improved road safety. The core road network includes
state highways and the most heavily trafficked major district roads.

COMPONENTS

3.2    At appraisal, the project was estimated to cost US$447 million, financed by a
$360-million World Bank loan and $87 million from the Karnataka state government.
The project had the following components:

    Component 1: Upgrading and widening of state highways (cost at appraisal:
     US$315.0 million; at completion: US$356.2 million).This component was expected
     to support an increase in the capacity and structural strength of part of the core road
     network through the upgrading and widening of about 1,000 kilometers of priority
     state highways and construction of about 50 kilometers of new bypasses.

    Component 2: Rehabilitation of state highways and major district roads (cost at
     appraisal: US$107.2 million; at completion: US$158.7 million). This component
     aimed at reducing the periodic maintenance backlog on the core road network by
     funding the overlaying, resealing, and minor rehabilitation of about 1,300 kilometers
     of state highways and major district roads..

    Component 3: Institutional Strengthening, Advisory Technical Assistance,
     Training, Equipment, and Pre-investment Studies (cost at approval: US$17
     million; at completion: US$19.2 million). This component aimed at financing
     consultant services and Technical Assistance and Training programs to facilitate the
     implementation of the Institutional Development Strengthening Action Plan designed
     to strengthen the overall institutional capacity of the Karnataka Public Works
     Department. It was also expected to fund the short- and medium-term training
     activities of Public Works Department managers and staff, office equipment for
     implementing an e-governance program within the Department, laboratory
     modernization, and development of road management systems, other logistical

26
  The PAD also mentions ―improved allocation and provision of funding for the road sector‖ would be
necessary to meet the development objective. However, this we would argue is an output rather than an
outcome, as it is completely under the control of the borrower.
                                            29


    support including vehicles, and techno-economic feasibility and detailed engineering
    studies for future road investment projects.

   Component 4: Pilot Highway Safety Program (cost at approval: US$4 million; at
    completion: US$0.6 million). This component was expected to finance civil works
    for the implementation of engineering and traffic management measures to enhance
    road safety and mitigate traffic accidents at selected black spot locations along the
    project corridor. The component supported Technical Assistance and consulting
    services for safety audits and the development of a proposed safety management
    system and equipment for safety management system.

2.4     The Karnataka Public Works Department had overall responsibility for project
implementation. The Department established a Project Implementation Unit to manage
project preparation and implementation activities on a day-to-day basis. The Project
Implementation Unit was headed by a Chief Project Officer supported by a Chief
Engineer and other technical and administrative staff.

RELEVANCE

3.3     Relevance of the objective is rated Substantial. The project development
objective is highly relevant to the state‘s developmental needs in the roads sector, and
aligned with the Bank‘s Country Assistance Strategies at project approval (CAS 1997;
2001) and well as the more recent Country Partnership Strategy (FY2009-12). However,
the objective was poorly articulated in that it did not convey a sense of expected
outcomes and benefits from the project. The state government articulated its strategy for
the roads sector through its Infrastructure Policy (1997) and Policy on Road Development
(1998). These documents recognized that road development, rehabilitation and
maintenance are critical to meet growing demands for improved infrastructure. They
pointed to the need for progressive widening and strengthening of the core road network
with prioritization based on economic grounds, and to concentrate on improvement of
maintenance management and funding on the primary state road network because of their
strategic importance to the state's economic development needs. The Bank‘s strategies
called for mobilizing increased outlays for investment and maintenance of road
infrastructure; and facilitating private sector involvement in engineering, construction and
maintenance.

3.4     Relevance of project design is rated Substantial. The project design addressed
the immediate needs for rehabilitating and upgrading prioritized roads as well as the
improving the capacity of the Public Works Department roads agency for managing the
road network. Together with the government‘s commitment to make greater provision of
funds for regular maintenance, the physical and institutional components were geared to
the project development objective of improving the quality of the core road network. The
project design also included a pilot intervention for improving road safety, an important
element of the quality of the network. Provision was made for supporting resettlement
and rehabilitation arising from land acquisition, and transfer of expertise for
implementing environmental and social safeguards. The institutional component was
designed to enhance the capacity of the Public Works Department through a Institutional
Strengthening Action Plan (ISAP) that covered all areas of planning and management for
                                            30


the Public Woks Department. The monitoring and evaluation framework provided
appropriate and measurable outcome indicators. Overall, the project‘s design was
consistent with the development objectives.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION DESIGN

3.5     The project used six outcome indicators: (a) the share of state highways in good
condition (IRI < 4.0 m/km); (b) the share of state highways in bad condition (IRI > 7.0
m/km); (c) reduction in state highway links with volume-to-capacity ratio greater than 1;
(d) reduction in travel time on project roads; and (e) reduction in road accident deaths per
10,000 registered vehicles. The sixth outcome indicator proposed by the project related
to the improvement in the living standards of the project affected persons. Intermediate
outcome indicators in the project appraisal document relating to road safety were the
number of accident blackspots removed and the share of state highways using a
computerized accident analysis system. In respect of maintenance funding, output
indicators included in the M&E design was the variance between the Medium-Term
Financial Plan budget and actual expenditures; and maintenance funding gap for the core
road network. Other intermediate outcomes proposed by the project design relate to
efficiency measures (cost and time overruns) and goals for environmental and social
safeguards implementation, which are normally covered in the assessment of safeguards.
In retrospect, other intermediate output indicators could have been devised to track
capacity-building efforts, such as mainstreaming the use of the Road Information System
and training.

Implementation
3.6     The project period was extended by ten months, but there were no significant
changes in the scale or scope of the project. Project appraisal was completed on January
18, 2001; the project was approved on May 24, 2001, and became effective on August 8,
2001. The closing date was extended by 10 months from December 31, 2006 to October
31, 2007 to account for delays in civil works. There were delays in the mobilization of
some contractors, as well as delays in procurement and supervision. In some cases,
design changes and variations in the scope of road works also contributed to the delay.
Shifting of utilities and land acquisition were initially affected due to insufficient
coordination with relevant government departments. Abnormally high monsoon rains that
affected Karnataka (2005-2006) resulted in flooding in several project areas and delayed
the completion of some works and the start of some contracts.

3.7     There were lags in disbursement, but eventually the project caught up and
disbursement was ultimately on target. The loan was fully disbursed and the Bank
recovered the Special Account advance (US$25 million) before loan closing. An
unallocated loan amount of US$29.4 million along with a small unutilized loan amount
were reallocated to accommodate the increase in costs due to price escalation and
variations.

3.8    Limited experience and skills among contractors were a constraint in the initial
years. The project was the first major externally funded roads project in the state of
Karnataka. Prior to this project, although most improvement contracts were undertaken
                                                    31


by private sector contractors, there was no emphasis placed on their management
capacity and understanding of international standards for road contracts. Most of the
local contractors faced technical capacity constraints and lacked proper construction
management skills and experience in resource planning and execution. As a result, some
contractors fell behind schedule and required contract time extensions. In one case a
contractor that had won five rehabilitation bids could not make sufficient progress in their
work, which led to the contracts being terminated and re-bid. During project
implementation, training was delivered to the Public Works Department staff and
contractors on modern contract management techniques to enhance their capacity, and
together with on-the-job experience.

3.9     Greater deployment and capacity of the Public Works Department staff was
needed for contract supervision and handling non-infrastructure related programs.
While the Public Works Department made a commitment to supervise a significant
amount of the rehabilitation works under the project, it failed to fill a large number of
vacancies (18 vacancies out of 44 supervisor positions) in the field offices during the
project. This contributed to delays in physical implementation of the contracts that were
directly supervised by the Public Works Department leading to contractors' seeking time
extensions.

SAFEGUARDS

3.10 The project was classified as a Category ―A‖ project under the Bank‘s
environmental and social safeguard policies. The safeguard polices for environmental
assessment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples27 were triggered. A
Sectoral Environmental Assessment, a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment, an
Environment Management Plan, and a Resettlement Action Plan were prepared following
public consultation and stakeholder meetings. The documents were disclosed to the
public, as required. In Phase II of the road works, separate Environmental Management
Plans were prepared to confirm the extent of adverse impacts on sensitive environmental
habitats traversed by these roads. Clearances were obtained from the Government of
India for the road segments passing through a national park and sanctuary,28 with the
necessary safeguards being included in the works contracts. Overall compliance with
environmental and social safeguard requirements was satisfactory though there were
shortcomings and delays in the course of their implementation as discussed below.

3.11 Environmental Safeguards. The provisions of the Environmental Management
Plan were integrated into contracts and their implementation was monitored by the Public
Works Department and its environmental consultants. The enforcement of some
environmental management measures that were incidental to works, such as proper
storage, re-utilization and/or disposal of debris, and clearance of culverts, was lacking in
several contracts due to the understaffing of the Public Works Department environmental
team. Regulatory clearances were inordinately delayed due to differences in

27
  The policy on indigenous peoples was triggered as a matter of abundant caution, but no issues under this
policy materialized during the project.
28
 Rajiv Gandhi National Park, the buffer area of the Dandeli Wild Life Sanctuary, and the periphery of
Anshi National Park
                                                    32


interpretation of land ownership between the Public Works Department and the Forestry
Department and late identification of the issue. There were delays in obtaining the
required permissions in a few of these rehabilitation packages in the Western Ghats hill
range, even after extensive discussions with the Forestry and Revenue Department
officials. A total of 45,753 trees were cut to make way for the upgrading works. Re-
planting was carried out as stipulated at the rate of ten saplings for every tree that was cut
down. Survival rates of replanted trees was reported to be high (an average of 92
percent) at the end of the project.

3.12 Contractors were provided with sensitization training on environmental issues.
An environmental supervision manual was prepared which helped streamline the
environmental management function at the Project Implementation Unit. The main
principles of the manual have been incorporated into the Departmental Code. The
Departmental Code is expected to be cleared by the finance ministry by mid-2012.
Continuity of staff working on environmental issues in the project implementation unit as
well as from the Banks‘ team helped to ultimately ensure satisfactory implementation of
environmental provisions during the project.

3.13 Social Safeguards. The land acquisition process was slow, and took an average
of 28 months.29 Insufficient coordination with other government departments regarding
compensation payments added to the delay. High turn-over of the key land acquisition
and rehabilitation and resettlement staff and consequent understaffing in the Social
Development and Resettlement Cell affected progress in implementation of the
resettlement action plan during the first years of the project. Some changes made in
engineering designs during project implementation further contributed to delays in land
acquisition and resettlement.

3.14 Ninety hectares of private land belonging to 1,260 landowners was acquired in the
project and it impacted 2,520 non-title holders, including 265 households that lost their
dwellings and 404 households that lost their livelihoods. Compensation and assistance
were provided to all these affected people in compliance with resettlement and
rehabilitation entitlements, except for about 45 identified families that migrated to nearby
towns or adjoining villages and could not be traced. Land acquisition costs and cash
compensations under the project were funded entirely by the state government.
Resettlement and rehabilitation entitlements, including allowances, training, and
monitoring and evaluation of project expenditures, were eligible for Bank financing. The
total cost of implementation of land acquisition and resettlement impacts was about INR
180 million, about 0.80 percent of the total project cost.

3.15 There was a delay in the implementation of resettlement and rehabilitation policy
in the villages of Athni, Nagamangala, Chikkanayakanhalli, and Siriguppa (which were

  More than half of the 59 land acquisition proposals took more than 2 years to resolve, with an average
time of about 26 months. Only 7 percent of the proposals took less than 18 months. The minimum and
maximum time spent on completion of land acquisition process is 14 and 42 months, respectively.

Department promptly carried out an assessment of impacts, prepared an action plan
suggesting the remedial measures in accordance with policy provisions and accordingly
extended the assistance to these affected people.

3.16 A resettlement impact assessment study conducted by MDP Consultants Private
Limited, New Delhi, in partnership with DHV consultants, a Netherlands based firm,
showed that 86 percent of resettled households had improved their incomes and the
proportion of families living below the poverty line had declined by 12 percent. The
resettled households now have larger and improved housing, and access to electricity and
drinking water. Adult workers among the resettled households have been successful in
finding alternative employment opportunities and raising their incomes. The impact
assessment considers the quality of housing provided to the resettled families to be
superior to the housing offered under general Government programs for poorer families
(Box 2).

   Box 2. Social Safeguards at a Resettlement Camp at Ariginimara

  The IEG mission visited a resettlement colony at Ariginamara, where 124 families (nearly
  1000 persons) were resettled under the project‘s Kalmala to Sindhanur sectiona in 2004.
  The beneficiaries were originally living on the other side of the road and engaged in
  miscellaneous service activities and informal employment. The families have been
  provided independent homes constructed by Nirmiti Kendra, an autonomous government-
  sponsored agency. The colony is laid out quite spaciously with electricity, nearby water
  supply, and adequate drainage. A metalled road built under the central government‘s rural
  roads programb connects the colony to the highway. A community hall, a three-room
  school, and a crèche have been provided. A municipal ward member has been elected from
  the colony to represent the interests of the residents. A cross-section of men and women
  from the colony selected by the mission for feedback expressed satisfaction with the living
  facilities and commended the work done by Public Works Department. The residents also
  reported that in the seven years since the camp has been established, the land property
  prices have gone up significantly. Public Works Department officials consider this a model
  rehabilitation initiative.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

3.17 A computerized project financial management system was developed during
project preparation for accounting and reporting on expenditures, and was rolled out to
Public Works Department headquarters, sixteen Public Works Division Offices, five
Circle Offices and three Zonal Offices by 2004. However, the project financial
management system was eventually dropped after several glitches were experienced with
the software. The function is now managed by Karnataka‘s e-governance Department
which has since undertaken a state-wide exercise for implementing contract management
and e-procurement. It was agreed that the new software would be in line with the
requirements of the project financial management system. The e-procurement system is
being piloted in 6 departments, including the project unit managing the follow-on project.
At project completion, no qualified audits were reported.
                                            34


3.18 Procurement of works, goods, and services was carried out in accordance with
Bank guidelines, and the bidding processes were conducted in a fair and transparent
manner. In 2005 the Bank‘s supervision mission requested that the Public Works
Department apply more rigorous monitoring to pending cases. Overall, delays in the
award of contracts resulted in one loan closing date extension that could have been
avoided with more efficient procurement. Revised standard bid documents and
procurement procedures were prepared, disseminated, and implemented in two pilot
divisions of the Department.

Achievement of the Objectives
3.19 Based on the outcomes that were indicated in the discussion of the objectives in
the project appraisal document, the achievements against the project development
objective are discussed below in terms of: (i) enhancing the capacity and quality of the
core state highway network; (ii) more efficient and effective network management and
delivery of road infrastructure services; and (iii) improving road safety. The first
outcome was the most important in terms of making gains in the quality of prioritized
roads. The second outcome underpinned both short term improvements in institutional
capacity as well as laying the foundation for medium to long-term improvements. The
third outcome was geared to some quick gains in road safety while building the
institutional basis for a larger road safety program.

ENHANCING THE CAPACITY AND QUALITY OF THE CORE STATE HIGHWAY NETWORK
Rated Substantial.

3.20 Outputs. In terms of physical outputs, the project achieved more than 90 percent
of the targeted physical road works at project completion. About 874 kilometers out of
the planned 884 kilometers of roads were upgraded and widened and 1,400 kilometers
out of a targeted 1,575 kilometers were rehabilitated.

3.21 Road upgrading was implemented in two phases. In Phase I, roads totaling 394
kilometers were earmarked for upgrading, but a contract for Bennethora Bridge was
dropped and taken up separately after project completion. Phase II of upgrading
comprised six road contracts and two bypasses, totaling 598 km. Work was, however,
still ongoing in the two by-passes and three contracts at project completion. Phases I and
II experienced average delays of 14 months and 6 months and cost escalations of 12
percent and 3 percent, respectively. All remaining works were taken to completion by
the Public Works Department after the project closed.

3.22 Road rehabilitation was carried out in two Phases, comprising 34 contract
packages. All 10 contracts in Phase I were completed. In Phase II, four packages (M15,
M25, M26, and M27) were ongoing at project completion and subsequently completed by
the Public Works Department. The total implementation period for the rehabilitation
component was significantly delayed and the cost escalation was 18 percent at project
completion.
                                                     35


The mission visited eight road segments that were rehabilitated or upgraded.30 They
were selected by the mission to provide a reasonably balanced assessment of the project
roads covering districts with different levels of economic development. The mission
found that some segments of the rehabilitated roads had already developed potholes,
rutting, sinking, and other signs of distress. It was learnt that no maintenance funds had
been spent on these roads since improvements were made under the project. The mission
also found that some stretches of the upgraded roads have started showing signs of
distress. Unless immediate maintenance is taken up on these roads, they may soon require
rehabilitation, which will cost many times more than regular maintenance. Signs and
markings had faded in several road segments. Shoulder maintenance was also poor in
several places, with unmanaged growth of vegetation, which may interfere with drainage.

3.23 Maintenance expenditure: Maintenance expenditures have increased since project
completion. Actual state funded expenditures for routine maintenance and periodic
maintenance increased between 2008 and 2012, by 62 percent and 98percent respectively
at current prices. The share of maintenance expenditure in overall road sector increased
from 23percent in 2008-2009 to 50percent in 2011-2012, and allocations for 2012-2013
set this share at 41percent of total road expenditures. Actual maintenance expenditures
were close to budgeted maintenance expenditure during 2008-2011.

3.24 The public works department continues to project the requirements for
maintenance funds based on blanket norms (a fixed amount per kilometer) rather than on
the basis of road condition data, which is only partially available. Even the relatively low
allocation of maintenance grants was not used based on the demonstrated need. The
Public Works Department had planned to undertake the maintenance of 30 roads totaling
1,790 kilometers through long-term performance-based contracts. There is, however,
little progress on this front, apparently due to insufficient commitment on part of the
borrower as well as lack of preparatory work required to raise awareness amongst both
Public Works Department officials and prospective contractors.31

3.25 Outcomes. The share of state highways in good condition (<4m/km IRI)
increased from 5 percent at the beginning of the project in 2001 to 37 percent by the end
of the project. At the same time, the percentage in bad condition (>7m/km IRI) decreased
from 90 percent to 52 percent against a target of 70 percent. According to a later road
condition survey (Public Works Department: Road Condition Survey, 2008), the
percentage of state highways in good condition remained more or less unchanged at 35
percent.

3.26 However, 50 percent of the State Highways were reported to be in good condition
as of 2008.32 Road condition data for 2010-11 for project roads provided by the Public
Works Department show that IRI for three highways, segments of which were visited by
the mission (shaded rows in Table 7 below) , is below 4 meters/kilometer, which meets

the benchmark for being in good condition.33 Of the remaining project roads, IRI values
(meters/kilometer) are below 4 for SH12, SH25 and SH93; between 4 and 5 for SH34 and
SH45; between 5 and 6 for SH30and SH33; and between 6 and 7 for SH50. None of the
roads are in the range for ‗poor condition‘, which is an IRI value 7 or greater. (Table 7).

* Work on the Road Packages was commenced in different years during the project


3.27     At project completion, the percentage of state highway road links with a volume-
to-capacity ratio greater than one declined by 13 percentage points against a target of 10
percentage points. Travel time on project roads decreased by 30-35 percent, depending
on the particular road link, against an overall target of 20 percent. No data were available
for more recent years.

MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND DELIVERY OF ROAD
INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES Rated Modest.

3.28 There was mixed progress across the different elements of the Institutional
Development Strengthening Action Plan for improving the state‘s capacity for road
sector management. Overall, the capacity of Project Implementation Unit has increased
substantially, but the improved capacity has yet to percolate significantly into the rest of
the Public Works Department, which manages the rest of the network. The Department
has yet to improve its maintenance planning and programming.



33
  In terms of the International Road Index (IRI) expressed in meter per kilometer, road condition is rated as
follows: 0-4: Good; between 4 and 7: Fair; greater than 7: Poor.
                                                     37


3.29 Outputs Officers from the Project Implementation Unit as well as other divisions
of the Public Works Department were trained in contract and project management,
including procurement. This has resulted in enhancing the capacity of engineers in the
Department as well as in Karnataka Road Development Corporation to a reasonable level
in managing both national competitive bidding and international competitive bidding
contracts. The Public Works Department staff also gained experience from external
experts through Project Coordination Consultancy services for project preparation,
detailed engineering designs and support for project management throughout the
implementation period. However, Public Works Department engineers need additional
training to manage and monitor the engineering consultants who are engaged for project
preparation and construction supervision of the works contracts. At present, land
acquisition and the shifting of utilities account for the major portion of activities for
engineers in the Project Implementation Unit.

3.30 Revised standard bidding documents and procurement procedures were prepared,
disseminated and piloted in two divisions of the Public Works Department. The state
government also initiated a pilot e-procurement platform through software of six modules
of which one provides contract management and financial management systems related to
works contracts. The e-procurement system was piloted in six departments, including that
of Public Works.

3.31      A Road Information System and IT-based tools for systematic road sector
management were initiated, including an annual maintenance plan prioritized on the basis
of road condition data. However, maintenance planning is weak in the Public Works
Department. Road data are being collected and the state‘s road network has been mapped
digitally with nodes and links. Road condition data for the core state highway network
are now available for 2008-2009. In 2005, the Public Works Department procured Road
Measurement Data Acquisition System vehicles capable of automatically recording road
roughness and other road parameters, and also carrying out video-logging of the road
conditions. However, collection of road condition data through this system is at an early
stage and cannot yet be used as a basis for estimating and prioritizing the application of
maintenance funds. The Department is trying to ensure that appropriately trained
contractors are assigned to operate the vehicles. Its ‗ownership‘ of the data has also to be
clearly established by suitably involving the department‘s staff in the process. Public
Works officials felt that the local contractors are not yet sophisticated enough to use IRI
data. This has implications for the need to provide information and training for
contractors. The introduction of a pavement management system and a bridge
management system is overdue.

3.32 A needs assessment report and a Human Resource policy and
improvement/learning plan were developed and are being cleared for further processing
by the state Cabinet.34



34
  A review of evolving Public Works Department functions, organization and staffing relative to road
sector challenges, and identification of future institutional development strategy and options has been taken
up in the Second Karnataka State Highway Improvement Project.
                                                      38


3.33 The study on the establishment of a Road Fund was completed and the Cabinet is
considering its recommendations. A Public-private Infrastructure Advisory Facility
(PPIAF) grant has recently been obtained to set up the Road Fund whose mandate will be
to support maintenance and operation and service domestic debt.

3.34 The Departmental Code, which specifies the roles, powers and responsibilities of
each officer in addition to many other aspects, was being revised at the time project
completion. The mission was informed that the revisions, including responsibilities for
environmental and social safeguards, have been made and clearance is expected from the
finance ministry by mid-2012.

3.35 Traffic data are being collected every year (7 day traffic count) at specified traffic
count stations. But most of these stations are said to be near built-up areas which gives
only partial picture of the traffic intensity. The transport department is planning to better
locate the traffic count stations to reflect the conditions in real-time.

3.36 Outcomes. There were no specific outcome indicators for measuring the
efficient and effective network management and delivery of road infrastructure services.
However, gains were made in capacity for procurement, technical engineering design,
and contractor management. Following project completion, there has been some
progress on the Road Information System, though much needs to be done before it can
aid the planning and decision-making process for road maintenance. The revised
Departmental Code is now pending approval from the finance ministry.



IMPROVING ROAD SAFETY Rated modest

3.37 Outputs. This component disbursed only 16 percent of the appraised amount. It
financed civil works for the (i) implementation of engineering and traffic management
measures to enhance road safety and (ii) mitigation of traffic accidents at selected black
spot locations along the project corridor through the Blackspot35 Improvement Program.
All 25 identified blackspots were improved. The contract concerning engineering and
traffic management measures was terminated because the consulting firm, which was
appointed to develop and deliver an accident analysis system, did not make progress.
The component also supported the development and implementation of a Road safety
Action Plan. An NGO undertook a road safety awareness campaign in two districts where
there was substantial length of project roads – Belgaum and Raichur – using street plays,
street singing and impromptu focus group discussions to disseminate messages relating to
road safety. Eventually, the Public Works Department re-bid the consultancy services for
installation of the accident analysis system before the closure of the project, which
together with road safety audits are being supported in the follow-up project.36 A Road
Safety Council (for coordinating the road safety initiative) was created as planned, but it
has not been activated, due to lack of resources or follow-up by the administration. The
Public Works Department reports that under the followup project, a Road Safety Cell is

being established in the Department, while the Karnataka State Highway Transport and
Traffic Authority is being set as the Road Safety lead agency.

3.38 Outcomes. A Road User Satisfaction Survey carried out in Karnataka in 2002
showed 53 percent of respondents felt unsafe on national highways, and 66 percent on
state highways, while in 2007 this number declined to 39 percent and 30 percent for
national and state highways, respectively. Nearly 30 percent of the identified blackspots
did not have any accidents at all by the end of the project, and the rest saw a decline in
the range of 35 percent-88 percent. The annual accident data collected on project roads
showed an increase from 4,596 accidents in 2004 to 7,755 in 2006 and 5,830 in the first
seven months 2007. Similarly the number of fatal accidents also increased from 350 in
2004 to 615 in 2006 and 461 in the first seven months of 2007. However, the absolute
increase in accidents and deaths may be due to greater traffic volume. State-wide road
accident fatalities per 10,000 registered vehicles declined from 16.0 in 2007 to 14.2 in
2008 and further to 12.5 in 2009. The lone intermediate outcome indicator for the share
of the state highways network using the accident analysis system did not show any
progress during the project.

3.39 Other Outcomes: Quality control. ISO 1400137 certification was obtained for the
project implementation unit, Karnataka Roads Development Corporation Limited, and a
few divisions of the Public Works Department during the project. This is planned to be
extended across the Department in a phased manner. Officials told the mission that the
state government is keen on improving quality in their road works. With this view, the
follow-up project has engaged outside experts to conduct quality audit at frequent
intervals while work is in progress.

Efficiency
3.40 Efficiency of the project is rated Substantial. The overall weighted-average
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the upgrading and rehabilitation components were
36 percent and 18 percent respectively, though they were somewhat lower than the

  ISO 14001 belongs to the family of standards related to environmental management administered by the
International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), Canada. ISO 14001 is voluntary, with its main
aim being to assist companies in continually improving their environmental performance, whilst complying
with any applicable legislation. Organizations are responsible for setting their own targets and performance
measures, with the standard serving to assist them in meeting objectives and goals and the subsequent
monitoring and measurement of these (IISD 2010).
                                            40


estimates at appraisal: 50 percent and 29 percent respectively. The ERRs incorporated the
increase in traffic volume and increase in benefits from reduction of vehicle operating
costs, especially savings from fuel costs. The ex-post economic analysis was carried out
using the Version 1.3, and followed the same methodology used at appraisal.

3.41 The final ERRs reflect the cost overruns experienced in upgrading (15 percent)
and in rehabilitation works (18 percent), as well as the overall delay of ten months in
project completion. The reasons for cost overruns included increases in construction
material prices, slow mobilization of some contractors, changes in engineering design in
some cases, re-bidding of five contracts, delays in obtaining forestry clearances and work
disruptions due to heavier than normal monsoon rains during 2005-2006.

3.42 The final cost of the institutional component was US$19.2 million against the
planned cost of US$17.0 million, representing an increase of 13 percent. All the planned
activities relating to consultant services, technical assistance and training programs to
facilitate the implementation of the Institutional Development Strengthening Action Plan
were carried out during the project period. Activities relating to the short- and medium-
term training activities of Public Works Department managers and staff, and procuring
office equipment for implementing an e-governance program within the Department,
laboratory modernization, and development of road management systems were also
completed during the project period. Feasibility studies for 4,900 km were completed by
the end of the project and detailed project reports for the remaining 2,400 km of roads
were completed after project completion.

Ratings
OUTCOME

3.43 The relevance of the project development objective is rated substantial given that
it could have been stated more explicitly in terms of the three individual objectives of
enhancing the quality of the road network, effective roads management and improved
road safety. The relevance of project design is also rated substantial based on the clear
linkages of each objective and component to specific outcomes. The outcomes from the
physical improvements were substantially realized, and therefore the efficacy of
enhancing the quality of the road network during the project is rated substantial.
However, the outcomes were modest overall in respect of the institutional development
efforts, in spite of improved capacity in some areas of planning and management.
Outcomes for improving road safety were modest. Efficiency is rated substantial. Based
on ratings for relevance, efficacy and efficiency, overall outcome of the project is rated
moderately satisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

3.44 Risk to the condition of the improved core road network in Karnataka is
Moderate. Much of the enhancement in capacity has remained within the project
implementation unit and has not spread sufficiently to the rest of the Public Works
Department which is a concern for the sustainability of the gains made in road quality.
The mission was informed that as of November 2011, project roads have not had any
                                                   41


significant maintenance performed on them since the end of the project in 2007. The
mission observed potholes, rutting, and other signs of distress in some segments of
project roads during site visits that covered a small sample of project roads. A full
assessment of road condition and quick remedial action is required for the affected
segments to avoid more expensive rehabilitation in the future. Discussions with officials
following the site visit confirmed that these actions are being initiated. Non-plan
expenditure for roads, which covers routine activities, declined or stayed flat in nominal
terms between 2007 and 2011, and is likely to have declined in real terms. The budgeted
expenditure for non-plan expenditure shows an increase of nearly 50 percent for 2011-
2012. The Public Works Department reports that maintenance expenditures have
increased since project completion. Actual state funded expenditures for routine
maintenance and periodic maintenance increased between 2008 and 2012, by 62 percent
and 98percent respectively at current prices.

3.45 The responsibility for road safety is diffused across departments and there is no
single lead agency that has the ownership and mandate to address road safety across
Karnataka in a multi-sector or holistic fashion. More recently, The mission was informed
that under the follow-on project – which includes a major component for road safety – a
Traffic and Road Safety Cell has been established in the Transport Department, which
has been assigned a lead agency role for road safety management.

3.46 The follow-up project includes consulting services for implementation of civil
works to support the establishment and operation of the Planning and Road Asset
Management Center38 of the Public Works Department, which is being chaired by a state
level Minister. The Project will help to continue implement a new Institutional
Development and Strengthening Action Plan.

3.47 Once finalized, the documents will be used across the Public Works Department.
Overall, procurement processes have improved in the Project Implementation Unit as
well as more broadly across the Public Works Department due to the project experience.

As of now, the Public Works Department is using a uniform bid document. In the follow
up project, the latest harmonized FIDIC39 document is being followed.

3.48 Though the Project Implementation Unit has engaged third parties to audit the
quality and other aspects of road works, it is necessary for the Public Works Department
to develop skills to monitor and manage the consultants engaged in construction
supervision. Overall, it is crucial to carry out a training needs assessment that identifies
requirements for junior, middle-level and senior management, as well as at the
headquarters and district levels. So far, training has taken place mainly from project
funds because no specific budget provision has yet been made for training.

3.49 The Public Works Department has improved its planning and project preparation
capacity. This is demonstrated in manner in which they organized the process for land
acquisition and shifting of utilities. Following this project experience, the state
government has revised the Resettlement and Land Acquisition Policy principles and
provisions of the new national rehabilitation and resettlement policy. This improvement
has already been demonstrated in the follow-up project Karnataka State Highways
Project II, for which land acquisition and shifting of utilities have proceeded more
efficiently.

3.50 Post-Project Developments: In 2011, the Public Works Department launched a
State Highway Development Program that will upgrade and rehabilitate 10,000 km of the
Core Road Network under item-rate contracts with a stipulation of two-year maintenance
periods. A dedicated Project Implementation Unit has been set up for this purpose in the
Public Works Department, and the implementation of the State Highway Development
Program will follow procurement and safeguard practices similar to those used in this
project. The Public Works Department considers this as a potential spillover of the
capacity built in the project to the rest of the Department.40

3.51 In 2009, the Karnataka Transport Secretariat issued a Road Development Policy
which (a) mandates the Karnataka Highway Traffic and Transport Authority ―as an
executive entity and the nodal road sector planning and regulatory body of the
Government of Karnataka‖; (b) commits to establish a Karnataka Road Fund based on
the study completed under the Karnataka State Highways project; (c) launches a
―comprehensive Toll policy‖ for the entire core network (d) promotes Public Private
Partnerships for construction and long-term operation and maintenance contracts, through
Viability Gap funding support, annuity modes, and the use of Special Purpose Vehicles
and (c) redefines the respective areas of competences of the Public Works Department, ,
the Project implementation and the to ensure a consistent development and management
of Core Road Network. In July 2010, a tolling policy allowed the Karnataka Roads
Development Corporation Limited and private concessionaires to toll State Highways and
major district roads.

BANK PERFORMANCE

3.52 Quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank's team undertook
detailed project preparation and had a constructive policy dialogue with the state
government to address the most critical areas for institutional reform in the roads sector
that would complement investments to improve the quality of the road network. In
retrospect, the institutional capacity building component could have been simplified by
focusing on a few critical areas rather than attempting a comprehensive sector reform.
This was particularly so because the Public Works Department was implementing for the
first time a project of this size, client capacity was known to be relatively weak, and the
level of commitment for completing the agreed reforms was difficult to ascertain in the
absence of any conditionality or monitorable triggers. However, a Quality at Entry
Assessment for the project carried out by the Bank‘s Quality Assurance Group rated
quality at entry as ―Satisfactory‖ and cited the following strengths: (i) a sound strategy to
build external pressure for change within the Public Works Department through the
promotion of user surveys and stakeholder forums; (ii) coordination of institutional
development in the provincial sector with the broader state level public resource
management framework, (iii) a procurement strategy in terms of sizing of contracts and
pre-qualification to promote modernization of private construction industry; and (iv) the
state‘s and the Public Works Department‘s commitment to support e-governance and a
financial management system.

3.53 The project‘s design appropriately addressed the state‘s priority needs for
rehabilitating and upgrading its core highway network. The project‘s design took into
account lessons learned from previous Bank road sector projects in India and other
countries. In particular, these lessons related to ensuring implementation readiness;
adequate institutional capacities for project management; client ownership for
implementing institutional development measures; and timely land acquisition and
implementation of social safeguard policies. A participatory approach was adopted
during project preparation through formal and informal consultations and meetings with
all relevant stakeholders. Their views were incorporated in the project design and in
some cases led to improvements in the engineering design and safety measures,
betterment in alignments, and extension of compensation to vulnerable squatters. The
monitoring and evaluation design included appropriate outcome and output indicators.

3.54 Several risks to project outcomes were identified at appraisal that included lack of
political endorsement and pressure as well as senior management leadership to
implement actions in the Institutional Development Strengthening (IDS) Action Plan;
delays in the clearance of construction sites prior to award of civil works contracts;
collaboration with other state government departments; ineffective supervision of works
by the Public Works Department including enforcement of environmental clauses;
inability of the state government to manage project fund flows effectively; the
government‘s commitment to steadily and substantially increase maintenance funding;
and delays in tender evaluation and award of civil works contracts. In retrospect, more
attention could have been paid to the existing level of capacity in the Public Works
Department, and the pace at which it could absorb new institutional capacity-building
measures.
                                                   44


3.55 Quality of supervision is rated Satisfactory. The Bank‘s team was proactive in
its supervision, and focused on finding ways to overcome the factors that hindered
progress in implementation. A total of 15 supervision missions were conducted over the
project period and the teams maintained a good balance of technical, institutional and
safeguards-related skills. In the last three years, the Bank's supervision efforts focused
much more on ensuring that the project's institutional strengthening activities went hand-
in-hand with the progress on civil works. Nevertheless, greater emphasis should have
been given to periodic supervision of project's fiduciary aspects in order to implement
satisfactory financial management systems and arrangements. Safeguard requirements
were adequately supervised. After project completion, the Bank continued to monitor
implementation of the remaining contracts as part of the preparation of the follow-on
project. The Bank as part of its fiduciary responsibility also continued to supervise the
implementation of the safeguard issues related to environment and social safeguards.

3.56 Despite measures to mitigate them, some risks identified at project design
materialized to different extents, especially those relating to supervision of works by the
Public Works Department and collaboration with the police, forestry department, and
local governments. During project implementation, the Bank and project team developed
new mitigation measures, including a Memorandum of Understanding between the Public
Works Department and the Forestry Department, to minimize the impact of these risks.

3.57       Overall Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

3.58 Government of Karnataka performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The
state government demonstrated a commitment to the project and reform in the road sector
through a series of actions relating to the transport sector as well as the state
administration as a whole. The Chief Minister established a task force on roads
improvement in the state 41 during 1999-2000 to identify road sector institutional
constraints and recommend solutions. The Karnataka Transparency in Public
Procurements Act, 2000, was adopted making tendering compulsory and aiming at
streamlining the procedures for inviting, processing, and accepting tenders. An
information technology strategy was developed by the Public Works Department in
January 2001, which laid the basis for an e-governance program and development of a
Geographic Information System (GIS)-based road information system.

3.59 Through most of the project period, the allocation of funds for maintenance fell
short of planned expenditures by 20 percent (2001-02) to about 50 percent in 2005-2006.
This variance was reduced sharply to 1 percent during the last year of implementation. In
2011, it was reported42 that about 30 percent of the budget allocation for roads was being
spent on maintenance in comparison to the norm43 of 60 percent. However, there is an
overall increase in the ―non-plan‖ expenditure on roads and bridges in the state from the

year 2009 to 2011. (Table 8). The Public Works Department reports that maintenance
expenditures have increased since project completion. Actual state government funded
expenditures for routine maintenance and periodic maintenance increased between 2008
and 2012, by 62 % and 98% respectively at current prices. The share of maintenance
expenditure in overall road sector increased from 23% in 2008-2009 to 50% in 2011-
2012, and allocations for 2012-2013 set this share at 41% of total road expenditures.
Actual maintenance expenditures were close to actual maintenance expenditure during
2008-2011. For the fincial year 2012-13, allocations from the state (US$40.9 million)
and from the central government (US$31.9 million) together cover the budgeted
requirement of US$72 million. There was little support for making a beginning with
pilot performance-based maintenance contracts as planned. A Karnataka State Road
Safety Council was established along with many District Safety Councils but they were
not activated. In terms of actions taken after project completion, the Public Works
Department reports that under the follow-up project, a Road Safety Cell is being
established in the Department, while the Karnataka State Highway Transport and Traffic
Authority is being set as the Road Safety lead agency.

3.60 Implementation agency performance is rated moderately satisfactory.
Throughout the entire preparation and implementation of the project, the project
implementation unit provided full cooperation and support to the Bank as well as to other
state agencies. In respect of monitoring and evaluation, the implementing agency
performed adequately in collecting data on outcome indicators throughout the
implementation period as well as conducting roads user surveys at the start and
completion of the project. While the supervision of contracts by the Public Works
Department in the first part of the project was not adequate, it improved later as the
Public Works Department built its capacity through training, and on-the-job experience
with the project coordination consultancy services. However, much of the enhancement
in capacity has remained within the project implementation unit and has not spread
sufficiently to the rest of the Public Works Department which is a concern for the
sustainability of the gains made in road quality. Further, the Public Works Department
needs to make headway in several of the institutional goals that it set for itself at the
beginning of the project. These include systematic maintenance planning based on a
functioning road information system, and provisions for improving road safety.

3.61   Overall Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

3.62 M&E Implementation. Baseline data for indicators were gathered during the
first year of implementation. Data were collected periodically. The Public Works
Department undertook monitoring and evaluation of black spots improvement and
worked with the police department to obtain accident casualty numbers. Road Users‘
surveys that were carried out towards the end of the project As the M&E design did not
provide adequately for measuring elements of capacity-building, it proved difficult to
estimate progress in this regard.

3.63 M&E Utilization. From the project documentation and discussions with project
staff, it appears that the data were not utilized adequately as a feedback mechanism for
                                                    46


taking corrective actions during implementation. Road Users‘ surveys were useful to the
Public Works Department in gauging perceptions of its performance and areas for
improvement. Overall, the Quality of M&E is rated Substantial.

4. India Road Transport Service Efficiency Study
Context
4.1     The Bank has had a long involvement in financing road infrastructure in India
(Appendix B Table 1), but by the early 2000s had not yet closely examined government
policies governing the road trucking transport industry, policies that can have a major
impact on economic returns on the huge investments made in the roads sector. This study
was intended to complement the Bank‘s substantial lending program in India‘s road
sector and fill this gap.

Process
4.2     The study objectives evolved in a Concept Note (Aug 2001) and were clearly
defined after review within the Bank and in a workshop with important stakeholders in
New Delhi held on January 8, 2003. The objectives of the study according to the study
inception note were to (i) achieve a better understanding of the non-infrastructure factors
that impair the efficiency of the road public carrier industry in India and thereby reduce
the return on infrastructure investments; (ii) establish quantitative measures of the
economic losses due to the major constraining factors; (iii) review the experience of
other countries that have faced similar problems, identify their solutions, and assess the
transferability of that experience to India; and (iv) engage the Government of India and
respective state governments, the transport operators, the shippers, and the passengers in
a dialogue in search of an appropriate set of policy solutions for India. The study was
completed in 2005 after a delay of two years. This delay was necessitated due to the
extra time required for completion of policy notes that formed inputs to the final study.
Despite the delay, the study was completed within the budgeted amount – US$326,000
against a planned US$366,000. The study was co-financed to the extent of US$54,000
through trust funds.44

4.3      The study obtained the inputs of various stakeholders (road transport suppliers
and their regulators, ultimate road users, shippers and passengers) through sample
surveys and interviews, to get a clearer picture of the quality, costs and efficiency of road
transport services.45 In this context, and in order to contain the study to manageable
limits, three states were selected for in-depth review of road transport issues – two
(Maharashtra and Karnataka) which have more advanced road transport administrations,
and the other (Uttar Pradesh) with a less advanced administration. The task was closely
linked to reform objectives and to underpin the Bank lending program through policy

44
     TF051481-UK-DFID.
45
  The study draws heavily on a number of studies that were carried out by Clell Harral, Ian Jenkin, John
Terry, Richard Sharp, Eugene Gurenko, the firm Consulting Engineering Services, Inc.(CES), and the
Asian Institute of Transport Development (AITD).
                                                      47


dialogue with the Government of India and the respective state governments on the
identified issues. Special attention was given to examine the serious problem of
overloading of trucks which damage roads for lack of axle load control, and to the
problem of subsidies for inter-city and rural bus services.

4.4     A Quality Assurance Group review of the study carried out in 2006 noted that the
progress of report preparation was closely monitored by the Bank‘s management.
Discussions with the task team confirm that Bank management was actively involved in
guiding the task from inception by providing adequate resources and by ensuring a good
skills mix. There was close collaboration between the field and headquarters staff. Peer
reviewers were well selected and competent, and their suggestions and technical advice
were taken into account.46

4.5     Interviews conducted by the mission suggest that the original schedule for the
study was optimistic, considering the complexity of the tasks. Even though it took about
two years more than estimated, the time taken to complete the study was reasonable,
given that the activities leading up to the report required a stakeholders sample survey, an
in-depth study of the road transport situation in three selected states, preparation of policy
notes, and organizing two workshops and two seminars to discuss issues of importance in
the sector. Additional time also became necessary to cover another important aspect of
the public policy failure, the failure in trucking insurance which was one of the factors for
the existing low level of safety. The preparation of the Policy Note on another crucial
issue – axle overloading and lack of enforcement of controls – in collaboration with the
Asian Institute of Transport Development in New Delhi also took significantly more time
than anticipated. Yet, there was no cost overrun in spite of the delays.

4.6      The criteria for rating each of the four elements of analytical and advisory
activities used in this review – strategic relevance and ownership, quality, dialogue and
dissemination, and results – are presented in Annex C, and a detailed assessment of the
Road Transport Service Efficiency Study is presented in Annex D.

Strategic Relevance and Ownership
4.7     The Indian Government had been using the landmark ―Sundar Committee
        47
report‖ on the trucking Industry in India (Asian Institute of Transport Development for
the Ministry of Surface Transport 1999) as a primary reference for the development of
the trucking industry policy (Box 3). However, as explained by the task team, the Bank
sought to convince the Indian Government that it was necessary to take a fresh look at the
policy regime and identify measures to improve the efficiency of the road transport
sector. The value-added was expected to come from identifying measures for potential
improvements in trucking industry policy through sample surveys of and interviews with
key stakeholders (government officials, road transport suppliers and their regulators,
ultimate road users, shippers, and passengers), in-depth study of selected states, and
comparison of the Indian road situation with comparator countries (China and Pakistan),

and drawing relevant lessons. The study team also wished to open a window of
opportunity for reforms in the sector in the context of future Bank lending. The Bank
intended to use the transport projects in the pipeline as a trigger to bring about policy
reforms to improve efficiency in the road transport sector.

     Box 3. “Sundar Committee? Report (1999): Methodology and Findings

     The ―Sundar Committee‖ Report analyzed a wide range of issues affecting road freight, to
     identify priorities for policy action. For this purpose, it carried out surveys on the Mumbai -
     Delhi, Delhi-Kolkata, and Kolkata-Chennai corridors. These corridors carry a major share of
     inter-state and inter-regional goods traffic in the country. The surveys involved observers
     travelling on a sample of trucks and recording times and reasons for all events (starting and
     stopping, loading/unloading, fuelling and maintenance, resting), including any delays
     attributable to administrative detentions at or between state borders. Supplementary
     information about the vehicle, crew and load, and about the road environment, was used to
     interpret these results. Additional information about expenses incurred (for official or
     unofficial payments) was also recorded to estimate overall trip costs.
     The Report identified, inter alia, the following major problems: excessive administrative
     detention of trucks; outdated vehicle technology; air pollution; axle overloading;
     exceptionally high accident costs; asymmetric coverage of labor hours regulation (small firms
     exempted); and lack of adequate cargo insurance facilities.



4.8    The study chose to focus on three areas that were considered the most relevant to
investments in highway infrastructure – the trucking industry, inter-city bus services, and,
because of its important but largely underserved role in enhancing road safety, the motor
insurance industry. The decision to thus narrow the focus of the study was appropriate
because a more comprehensive approach might have resulted in spreading attention over
too many issues.

4.9     The subject matter of the study was in line with the emphasis on road transport
infrastructure and services and their impact on India‘s economy in the CAS documents of
2001 and 2004 and the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for India for 2009-2012. It
was also in line with the priorities for road infrastructure and services laid out in India‘s
11th Five Year Plan document (2006-2011), which include addressing policy issues for
improving efficiency of road transport and the functioning of State Road Transport
Undertakings/Corporations.48 However it is doubtful, given the lack of progress on the
subject to date, whether there was any political will to move forward in this area.

4.10 Overall, strategic relevance and ownership of the study is rated moderately
satisfactory.

Quality
4.11 The study added value and credibility by directly obtaining the views of the most
important stakeholders – ultimate road users, shippers, and passengers. In the course of
the study, sample surveys were carried out to get a clearer understanding of the quality,
costs and regulation of road transport services and also to assess the role played, and
value added, by different actors. (such as truck operators, brokers, agents, and insurance
companies). The study went beyond studying the central government‘s role to analyze
issues at the state level in some depth, particularly since many of the problems relating to
road use efficiency were seen to arise because of the variation in regulations and
sales/octroi49 taxes across different states. The experience of the two comparator
countries – China and Pakistan – in dealing with road transportation issues to improve
efficiency in the sector constituted new learning for the study‘s audience. This experience
was gleaned from secondary information rather than surveys.

4.12 The report provides convincing empirical evidence, and uses quantitative data
well. It adds value by providing primary survey data, derived estimates from existing
data, as well as projections of costs for different policy scenarios. Examples include
survey data on truck driving labor and its conditions; truckload freight charges in various
countries; compilation of long-distance freight rates in India; estimated freight operating
cost of large and small truck operators; annual economic costs of administrative truck
delays; projections of road freight costs with increasing tractor trailer use; estimates of
annual unofficial payments made by truck operators; and estimated savings in economic
costs as a result of reforms.

4.13 The recommendations from the study are clear and actionable and are provided
separately under the heads of (1) trucking industry, (2) inter-city bus services, and (3)
motor insurance industry (Box 4). Recommendations for the trucking industry include
encouraging use of the multi-axle vehicles and tractor-trailer combinations, thereby
reducing transport costs and road pavement damage; and investment in permanent weigh
stations at strategic locations on the National Highway network to enable random checks.
Recommendations for inter-city buses included deregulation of tariffs, restructuring and
commercialization of State Transport Undertakings, elimination of their monopoly rights,
changes in the tax regime to achieve uniformity of tax treatment for all buses operating in
the inter-city markets, and creation of an independent agency to establish, monitor and
enforce competition rules and ensure access to common user infrastructure. For the motor
insurance industry, the study recommends switching to a system where experience-rated
premiums attach to the owner and the driver, rather than the vehicle.

4.14        Overall, the quality of the study is rated satisfactory.

Box 4. India Road Transport Service Efficiency Study - Main Recommendations

Trucking Industry
 To reduce delays at border crossings, particularly for high value or time-sensitive goods,
   consider a system to permit sealed trucks which elect to use the system to operate without en-
   route inspections on the basis of a certificate issued at origin by a duly authorized and bonded
   issuing entity.
 Encourage use of multi-axle vehicles and tractor-trailer combinations, thereby reducing
   transport costs and road pavement damage, it is recommended that incentives be put in place
   such as tax rates favoring such vehicles and reduced tolls on highways to reward their
   reduced impact on pavements.
 Since a significant portion of the driver population is illiterate, develop audio-visual driver
   training materials.
 To prevent excessive hours of driving, trucks operating outside their home state should be
   required to carry two licensed drivers at all times.
 To improve axle load controls, changes recommended are: expand enforcement authority
   beyond officials of the Motor Vehicles Department; distinguish between minor (up to 5
   percent of gross vehicle weight) and more excessive overloading for which there would be
   extreme penalties; and make abetment an offence to enable action against the broker or
   transporter arranging the load.
 Invest in permanent weigh stations at strategic locations on the National Highway network to
   enable random checks of trucks passing the weigh station when the station is open. Require
   trucks found to be over-loaded to unload the excess load at their own cost and risk.

Inter-City Bus Services
 Review the strategy for State Transport Undertakings (STU) reforms advanced by
    Association of State Road transport Undertakings.
 Reforms in the Inter-City Bus services sector should include deregulation of tariffs,
    restructuring and commercialization of STUs, elimination of STU monopoly rights, changes
    in the tax regime to achieve uniformity of tax treatment of all buses operating in the inter-city
    markets, and creation of an independent agency to establish, monitor and enforce competition
    rules and ensure access to common user infrastructure (terminals, bus stops).
 The appropriate public policy for the inter-city bus services sector would be to remove
    quantitative regulations restricting entry into the inter-city bus transport markets, and to allow
    market forces to determine both tariffs and the types of services offered.

Motor Insurance Industry
 Switch to a system where experience-rated premiums attach to the owner and the driver, not
   to the vehicle; be taken up as a matter of high priority by the Insurance Regulatory and
   Development Authority (IRDA).
 IRDA should initiate the development of an integrated claims database.
 IRDA should also explore the creation o f a motor insurance pool for bad drivers who have
   been denied cover by the insurance industry.
 Finally, the report recommends amendment of the Motor Vehicle Act of 1988 to remedy
   deficiencies with respect to motor insurance such as the lack of provisions regarding a statute
   of limitations, liability limits and thresholds for claims adjudication.

Dialogue and Dissemination
4.15 The team discussed the Concept Note with the stakeholders in a workshop at the
inception of the study (New Delhi, January 2003). The findings of the study were
presented at seminars held in New Delhi the context of the ―Convention of Reforms in
the Road Transport Sector‖ organized by the All India Confederation of Goods Vehicles
Owners Organizations and the All India Bus Operators Confederation in February 2005
and the ―Global Infrastructure Summit‖ organized by the Federation of Indian Chambers
of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) in March 2005 and Participants included senior
officials of Central and State Government agencies, NGOs, and various private sector
organizations involved in the road transport sector. The feedback from these seminars
was incorporated in finalizing the report which came out November 1, 2005. The Bank
was able to get the media and public interest groups involved in the seminars and this
helped to add to the awareness of the issues in the sector. However, these events did not
result in any specific commitments on the part of the government representatives and
others to follow up on the recommendations of the study.

4.16 The study is referred to in technical papers as well as popular publications,
confirming that the study‘s recommendations still have currency. A partial internet search
reveals that the study has been referred to by reports/papers from the Indian Council for
Research on International Economic Relations, the Journal of Asian Public Policy, and
the New Zealand Transport Agency (Postigoa 2008, Neon and de Pont 2009, Ganguli and
Mukherjee 2009). The main recommendations of the report are referred to at length in
the popular publication, ―India – the Emerging Giant‖ (Panagariya 2008).

4.17 Overall, the Dialogue and Dissemination of the study is rated moderately
satisfactory.

Results
4.18 While the Road Transport Service Efficiency Study for India has received broad
support and a wide audience among transport users through various workshops and
conferences, there is little evidence of the government‘s willingness to act on the study‘s
recommendations. Where there has been some significant action (on axle load controls),
it was the result of public interest litigation by a transporters association and a consequent
Supreme Court ruling.50 From discussions with the task team it is learnt that the Bank
has continued to try to impress upon the Ministry for Road Transport and Highways and
the Insurance regulator (IRDA), the importance of some of the issues for improvements
in road safety and road transport efficiency. However, the response in this respect has
been low.


50
  In a significant judgment on November 9, 2005, the Supreme Court of India has quashed the issuance of
Gold Card/ Tokens by the State Governments permitting overloading of trucks in excess of prescribed
weight limit. The Court has mandated that the trucks found on roads carrying illegal excess load will have
to offload the cargo crossing the legal weight limit. This judgment is expected to have multiple impact on
various stakeholders in the trucking and automobile industry.

4.19 According to the task team, the Bank expected to include some of the
recommendations from the study as conditionalities in proposed transport projects. An
examination of the Bank‘s lending portfolio after FY2005 does not reveal any specific
components or sub-components that are focused directly on the subject matter of the
study. The follow-on Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project II and the
proposed follow-on project in Gujarat (under preparation) have significant safety
components that overlap with some of the study‘s considerations. However, second
Karnataka project appraisal document does not make any direct reference to the study.
Discussions with the project‘s task team suggest that the study did not specifically figure
in the course of project appraisal document preparation, though it was considered broadly
with other relevant economic and sector work

4.20 Respondents from private sector, research institutions as well as government
officials told this mission that it is not politically easy to get remedial actions by State
governments in India which have varying regulations and tax regimes regarding sales and
octroi taxes affecting road transport. Professional competence and knowledge are not the
problem; the various institutions dealing with road transport in India have the capacity to
implement the necessary reforms. What is at a premium is the political will at the central
and State government levels to tackle serious issues affecting the sector.

4.21 However, judging from the feedback obtained from all categories of respondents,
where complex issues with multiple stakeholder issues are involved, a focused and high
quality knowledge product such as this study can serve to keep the dialogue going
between stakeholders. While there has not been much identifiable action on the issues
covered by the Road Transport Service Efficiency Study since it was disseminated, the
recurring references to the actionable recommendations of the study in research and
popular publications help to keep the issues alive. The study also can serve as a valuable
reference point for decision-makers as well as other stakeholders when the issues raised
by the study are followed up in policy and project activities.

4.22 Discussions with government officials, representatives of the trucking industry,
and researchers confirm that the additional value from the study comes from its
quantitative and qualitative analysis, extensive interaction with all stakeholders, and
highlighting parallels with other comparator countries, and the particular focus on the
three main issues of the study. At the same time, the overall view of the respondents is
that many of these issues and solutions have been separately raised and examined by
different studies by the government, research institutes as well as other stakeholder
organizations. The respondents generally felt that most of the recommendations of the
study remain valid today since there has been limited progress on the issues over the past
5-6 years. Some respondents felt that the recommendations could potentially translate
into time-bound targets for national and state governments.

4.23   Overall, the results of the study are rated moderately satisfactory.

5. Lessons
5.1      The following main lessons are drawn from this report:

     The physical and financial sustainability of a road network hinges on the road
      agency‟s capacity to undertake needs-based and timely implementation of road
      improvement and maintenance works. This enables optimal use of available
      funds, and avoids greater costs of repair in the future. Beyond project
      completion, Gujarat has worked to consolidate its capacity for and progress in
      monitoring road condition data and prioritizing road works on that basis. Data from
      selected state highway segments indicate that road condition (roughness) has been
      kept within acceptable limits. Karnataka has more work to do in building similar
      capacity, and this is reflected in signs of distress that are noted in project roads, five
      to seven years after improvement. Failure to take timely remedial action will result in
      far greater rehabilitation costs in the future.

     Institutional and administrative capacity-building should be carried out in step
      with the readiness of the target agency to internalize it. The ability to improve
      capacity on multiple fronts such as planning, procurement, contract management, and
      environmental and social safeguards may differ from one road agency to another, and
      may take more than one project cycle to materialize. In retrospect, institutional
      reforms in the Karnataka project could have been attempted in a phased and
      incremental manner, allowing time for them to be integrated with wider operations,
      and obtaining the support of key government departments and their leadership.

     As road agencies evolve from being providers of roads services to „managers‟ of
      increasingly outsourced functions, it is essential that core competencies are
      retained and strengthened to ensure sustainable management of the road
      network. The core competencies relating to planning, technical design, road
      management systems, procurement, contract management and environmental and
      social safeguards have been impacted to different extents in Gujarat and Karnataka
      due to outsourcing to consulting firms, staff turnover, staff depletion and lack of
      follow-up training. A credible mechanism for human resource management must be
      put in place to fill these gaps.

     The roads agency should lead the way in creating a productive working
      relationship with other entities involved in the implementation of roads projects.
      A culture of partnership and cooperation was demonstrated in Gujarat between the
      Roads and Buildings Department, road works contractors and supervising engineers
      which minimized disputes and speeded up implementation. The Roads and Building
      Department worked to earn the confidence of other parties through responding in a
      credible and consistent manner to issues that arose during project activities.

     Decentralization of the Bank‟s project leadership and supervision does not
      appear to confer any significant advantage over the task leadership based at
      headquarters. Feedback from the road agencies in Gujarat and Karnataka suggests
      that the locus of Bank task management did not make a significant difference in terms
                                            54


    of response time and attention span. In practice, both the Karnataka project, which
    was managed from the Bank‘s country office, and the Gujarat project, which was
    managed from the Bank headquarters, were able to conduct a similar number of
    supervision missions (KSHIP: 15; GSHP: 17). However, lending and supervision
    costs were significantly higher for the Gujarat project.

   A knowledge product that seeks to cover a subject that has already been well
    studied must provide clear justification of its likely added value. The Road
    Transport Service Efficiency Study covered subject matter that had been covered by
    other prominent reports within India. The new study was justified by highlighting
    the added value from surveys and interviews of stakeholders and gathering the
    experience of comparator countries. The study served to renew policymakers‘
    attention to politically challenging issues facing operators of freight trucks and
    passenger bus services, and the motor insurance sector.

The Bank has produced several important Economic and Sector work (ESW) products in the transport sector in India during
the last ten to fifteen years with several clustered around FY2005. These products were intended to complement the
substantial lending program commitments for the sector in the country ( about US$1.2 billion since FY2000, see Annex B
Table 1). The transport sector ESW products in India served several objectives: to stimulate thinking in policymaking circles
at the center as well as the states; to fill gaps in data and knowledge in sectoral and sub-sectoral issues of importance; to
promote interchange of ideas between different stakeholder groups; to bring in international experience; and to improve the
relevance and design of the Bank‘s lending program. A list of the Bank‘s major ESW products for the transport sector in
India in the last fifteen years is given below.

Ports and Shipping. (Ongoing Study)

The Road Transport Service Efficiency Study looked at the long-distance road transport industry in India, to identify
inefficiencies that could reduce the benefits from the large investments being made by the Government in the nation's
highway infrastructure. The study sought to assess the existing policy regime in the road transport sector in India, and
identify measures to improve the functioning of road transport, in particular long-distance road transport, and to enhance its
already enormous contribution (3.9 percent of GDP in 2005) to the workings of the Indian economy.

The Roads Transport Service Efficiency Study was initiated through a concept paper dated August 1, 2001. An initial
workshop was held on January 8, 2003 in New Delhi, which brought together representatives from the central and state
governments, state transport undertakings, trucker associations and user groups. The report was delivered to the client on
December 29, 2004, fourteen months later than originally planned. The findings of the report were discussed in two
workshops in February and March 2005, which brought together relevant stakeholders. The final report was issued as a
sector study and is available to the public as report no. 34220 through the Bank‘s external website www.worldbank.org.

                                                     Overall Assessment

This study focused on three issues of importance to investments in highway infrastructure - the trucking industry, inter-city
buses, and in view of its very important but largely unfulfilled role in enhancing road safety, the motor insurance industry.
Indian Government was already working on some of these issues, most notably through the landmark Sundar Committee
report of 1999 on the ―Trucking Industry‖ in India. However, the Bank‘s study was expected to add value by identifying the
scope for improvements in trucking industry policy through sample surveys of and interviews with key stakeholders, in-depth
study of selected states, and comparison of the Indian road situation with that of China and Pakistan to draw relevant lessons.
The designers of the study made a strong attempt to ensure client ownership. Based on the feedback obtained by this mission
from respondents in the central and state governments, private sector, research institutions and industry associations, the
study has served a useful purpose in raising awareness and serving as a credible input to policymaking in the three priority
areas. However, there has not been much follow-up to the recommendations either by way of new government policy
initiatives or as components of Bank projects. The study continues to be referred to and quoted by prominent journals and
publications, underlining the continued relevance and validity of its recommendations.

Criterion           Rating                                                  Comments
(A) Results       Moderately      Feedback from respondents suggests that the study added value by raising awareness of
                  Satisfactory    the issues and the required remedial measures in the media and among public interest
                                  groups, including NGOs. The study remains current in that it is referenced by recent
                                  research work and at least one prominent publication (India: the Emerging Giant by
                                  economist Arvind Panagariya) that has quoted and endorsed some of the study‘s
                                  recommendations at length. The study is only one – but significant – source of ideas for
                                  planners and policymakers. The findings of the study have the potential to be reflected in
                                  components and policy areas of Bank projects, but very little has been accomplished in
                                  this regard. In terms of influencing government policy, the main constraint is political will
                                  at the central and state government levels to take tough decisions to tackle the issues at
                                  hand.
(B) Strategic     Moderately      At the inception of the study, the Bank had not previously examined government policies
relevance and     Satisfactory    that govern the organization and functioning of the road transport carrier industry –
ownership                         policies that have a major impact on economic returns to huge investments in the sector.
                                  Given the Bank‘s continued heavy involvement in financing road infrastructure in the
                                  country, the study was relevant and timely. It was well-aligned with the Country
                                  Assistance Strategy (CAS) documents of 2001 and 2004 and the India Policy Review
                                  Document entitled ―India: The Challenges Ahead‖ (2002). It continues to be relevant in
                                  terms of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for India for 2009-2012 as well as the
                                  government‘s 11th Five Year Plan document (2006-2011), which gives priority to
                                  addressing policy issues for improving efficiency of road transport and the functioning of
                                  State Road Transport Undertakings/Corporations. The importance of the study was also
                                  underlined by the active participation of the central and State governments and other key
                                  stakeholders (such as organizations representing representatives of truck and bus
                                  operators, booking agents, brokers, and transport users) at the inception workshop. The
                                  Indian Government was already working on these issues, and had been using the landmark
                                  Sundar Committee report of 1999 on ―Trucking Industry‖ as a primary guiding force in
                                  the development of trucking industry policy. The task team was able to convince the
                                  government of the study‘s relevance, especially in terms of the value-added from
                                  interviews and sample surveys of stakeholders and a comparative analysis with respect to
                                  China and Pakistan.
(C) Quality       Satisfactory    The study resulted in an in-depth examination of priority issues related to the low
                                  efficiency of the road transport sector in India. Special attention was given to the serious
                                  problem of overloading trucks, which damages roads for lack of axle load control, and to
                                  the problem of high subsidies for inter-city and rural bus services. The report came up
                                  with appropriate and actionable recommendations under each issue. It provides empirical
                                  evidence, and uses quantitative data (some of which was gathered by the study as well as
                                  new analyses and projections on existing data) to underpin its arguments. Significant
                                  value has been added from getting the views of the most important stakeholders – ultimate
                                  road users, shippers and passengers, and also in assessing the role played and value added
                                  by different actors (such as truck operators, brokers, agents, and insurance companies). In
                                  addition to examining issues relating to the central government‘s role, three representative
                                  states (Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh) were chosen for the study, since many
                                  of the problems were seen to arise from the variation of regulations and sales/octroi taxes
                                  across different states. Moreover, two comparator countries were selected – China and
                                  Pakistan – to review how those countries have fared in dealing with the efficiency of the
                                  road transportation sector and to examine the lessons learned of relevance to India. The
                                  above features of the study provide evidence of efforts to provide a credible study
                                  supported by appropriate quantitative and qualitative analysis.

                                  March 2005. Participants included Central and State Government agencies, NGOs, and
                                  various private sector organizations involved in the road transport sector. The feedback

                                   1, 2005. The Bank was able to get the media and public interest groups involved in the
                                   seminars and this has helped to add to the awareness of the issues in the sector.

                                   the study‘s recommendations remain valid. A partial web search reveals that the study has
                                   been referred to by reports/papers from the Indian Council For Research on International
                                   Economic Relations (ICRIER), the Journal of Asian Public Policy, and the New Zealand

inception?       understanding of the non-infrastructure factors that impair the efficiency of the road public carrier industry
                 in India and thereby reduce the return on infrastructure investments; (ii) establish quantitative measures of
                 the economic losses due to the major constraining factors; (iii) review the experience of other countries that
                 have faced similar problems, identify their solutions, and assess the transferability of that experience to
                 India; (iv) engage the Government of India and respective state governments, the transport operators, the
                 shippers, and the passengers in a dialogue in search of an appropriate set of policy solutions.

                 Pradesh) were selected for dialogue; and two comparator countries – China and Pakistan – were selected for
                 analysis. The study expected to translate the recommendations into policy actions, through stakeholder
                 workshops and further dialogue with the government.

Did the country use the findings…
…in policy,      Perhaps. In a significant judgment on November 9, 2005, the Supreme Court of India quashed the issuance

regulation or    weight limit. The Court mandated that the trucks found on roads carrying illegal excess load will have to

Discussion of Results: The study added value by raising awareness of the issues and the required remedial measures in the
media and among public interest groups, including NGOs. But the study has not had a significant impact on policy makers in
the key relevant Ministry (Shipping, Roads, Transport, and Highways). According to members of the task team, the Bank‘s
intention was to translate the study‘s recommendations into triggers for tranche releases in proposed future transport projects,
but his has not yet been done. Political and government commitment are necessary to move things forward in a situation
where State governments in India have varying regulations and tax regimes regarding sales and octroi taxes affecting road
transport.

Discussion of Strategic Relevance and Ownership: Given the Bank‘s continued heavy involvement in financing road
infrastructure in the country, the study was relevant and timely. It was well-aligned with the Banks strategies for India as
outlined in its CAS (2001 and 2004) and CPS (2009-12), as well as India‘s Five Year Plan document (2006-2011). The
importance of the study was also underlined by the active participation of the central and State governments, and other key
stakeholders (organizations representing representatives of truck and bus operators, booking agents, brokers and transport
users, etc.) at the inception workshop. The Government of India was already working on these issues, and had been using the
landmark Sundar Committee report of 1999 on ―Trucking Industry‖ as a primary guiding force in the development of
trucking industry policy. Yet, the task team was able to convince the Government of India of the study‘s relevance, especially
in terms of the value-added from interviews and sample surveys of stakeholders, and a comparative analysis with respect to
China and Pakistan.

Discussion of Quality: The report provides empirical evidence, (some of which was gathered by the study as well as new
analyses and projections based on existing data) to underpin its arguments. Significant value was added by getting the
views of the most important stakeholders; examining issues relating to the central government‘s role and three representative
states (Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh) ; and drawing lessons from comparator countries (China and Pakistan).
The report came up with appropriate and actionable recommendations under each issue. Overall the result was a credible
study backed by well-researched evidence and supported by appropriate quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Discussion of Dissemination and Sustained Dialogue: The team discussed the Concept Note with relevant stakeholders in a
workshop at the inception of the study. The findings of the study were presented at seminars held in the context of the
―Convention of Reforms in the Road Transport Sector‖ organized by the All India Confederation of Goods Vehicles Owners
Organizations (ACOGOA) and the All India Bus Operators Confederation in February 2005 and the ―Global Infrastructure
Summit‖ organized by FICCI in March 2005 and Participants included Central and State Government agencies, NGOs, and
various private sector organizations involved in the road transport sector. The feedback from these seminars was incorporated
in finalizing the report which came out November 1, 2005. The Bank was able to get the media and public interest groups
involved in the seminars and this has helped to add to the awareness of the issues in the sector.
The study is referred to in technical papers as well as popular publications, confirming that the study‘s recommendations
remain valid.
