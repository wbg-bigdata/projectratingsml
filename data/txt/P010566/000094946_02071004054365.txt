1. INTRODUCTION
1.1    Overview of Gujarat State Highways Project
The state of Gujarat is located on the west coast of India, north of the state of Maharashtra
and bordering Pakistan to the northwest. The state straddles the Tropic of Cancer along the
Arabian Sea and occupies an area of 195,904km2.
The state has a road network of about 70,000km, of which 2,000km are primary network (the
National Highways, controlled by the Gol), and 20,000km are secondary network- (the state
highways, controlled by the R&BD, GoG), while the remaining roads are controlled by the local
self governments (Panchayats and Municipalities). Most of the state highways are either two-
lane or intermediate-lane-carriageway, on lOin road formation.
Due to rapidly increasing traffic, industrial. growth; and increasing levels of mobility, the
existing state highways are experiencing different levels of stress. The constrained capacity of
the state highways is a bottleneck for the ensuing industrial and economic development of
Gujarat. To relieve the stress on the state highways, the GoG has undertaken the Gujarat State
Highways Prbject (GSHP) with loan assistance from the World Bank (WB). Parts of a number of
key state highways will be rehabilitated and strengthened in this project.
The Gujarat "Project Co-ordinating Consultancy" (PCC) was undertaken by N D Lea
International Ltd, Canada (NDU) in association with Lea Associates South Asia Pvt. Ltd., India
(LASA). A "Strategic Options Study" (SOS), Lindertaken by LASA in 1995, evaluated 3000km of
state highways and selected 1500km for detailed feasibility study. The objectives of the PCC,
during the feasibility study, were to conduct a detailed feasibility study on these 1500km of
state roads and, using economic and environmental principles, establish a road investment
programme for a subset of these roads to be funded by the World Bank loan.
The project is being completed in three phases (Refer Table 1.1). Project preparation for
Phase I commenced on February 1997 and was completed by March 1997. Preparation of
Phase IIA project was completed by October 1998. Phase IIB project preparation started in
November 1998 and has been completed in 1999. Implementation of Phase I project has been
started in October 2000, Phase IIA by second quarter of 2002 and Phase IIB by fourth quarter
of 2002.
This report concerns Phase IIB project only. A Sectoral Environmental Assessment report for
the GSHP, as a whole, and Environmental Study Reports for Phase I and Phase IIA have
already been prepared, each incorporating an EMAP and a RAP. The Phase I and the Phase IIA
reports (NDLI/LASA, 1998) were appraised and endorsed by the GoG, R&BD and the WB.

GuJarat State Highways Project: Phase rIB - Vol. IhF
1.1.1    Objectives of the Project
The GSHP aims to improve a portion of the road transport network in the state within the
constraints imposed by the available funding. More specifically, the objectives are the following:
*   to provide more efficient transportation of passengers and goods in the state;
*   to provide better accessibility and reduce traffic distress on the arterial highways passing through
the state;
* to ensure longevity of the roads for more than 15 years, thereby reducing the cost of
maintenance, travel time and vehide operation; and,
.   to improve accessibility to the major ports, existing and proposed industrial estates, and
foreseeable mega-industrial com'plexes for efficient transport 6f goods.
1.1.2 Project Description
The GHSP generally involves widening and strengthening of the project corridors along the
existing alignment and within the existing RoW (subject to minor modifications in order to
improve road geometry and for road safety). Design standards for such improvement are
discussed in brief in the following sub-sections (for details, refer the Design Report, Vol. I of
Gujarat State Highways Project: Phase IIB).
The design width of the project roads has the following gradation: 8.5m pavement on a 10+m
road-formation, 10m pavement on a 12m road-formation, and four-laning. All roads in Phase
IIB are being widened to 10m pavement on a 12m road-formation. There is no four-laning
involved in Phase IIB.

Chapter 1 - Introduction
1.1.3 Benefits from the project
The project will result in substantial financial and social benefits. By up-gradation of the
strategic state highways, there will be improvement in overall transport capability in Gujarat.
Journey speed in the highways would increase, thereby there will be substantial savings in
terms of vehicle operating costs and value of time. The project will also lead to reduction in
road congestion; abatement of ambient air and noise pollution; improvement of roadside
drainage conditions, especially in the urban sections of the roads. A major contribution of the
project will be towards increase in safety levels (i.e., reduction in the propensity to have
accidents), for both pedestrians as well as motorists.
The project will improve access to a large part of the state and will relieve several bottlenecks
to development. The industrial sector in the state is expected to receive a tremendous boost,
as a result, since new areas will be opened ul) for urban-industrial development. There will be
several other macroscopic and indirect benefits (such as in the agriculture or mining sector).
On a local scale, people will be provided with facilities such as access roads, service lanes and
parking lanes within 'urban stretches'; bus stops, bus bays and truck parking bays; improved storm
water drainage in 'urban stretches'; demarcated pedestrian road crossing areas and footpaths;
street lights; community areas and roadside rest areas; improved highway-side environment, etc.
Some of the above benefits are quantifiable, and many of these are difficult to quantify. In the
economic prioritisation (NDLI/LASA, 1998a) the benefits quantified were: (i) road user effects
(RUEs) including savings in fuel, tyres, maintenance and repairs of vehicle, lubricants, crew
cost, capital cost including depreciation and interest, passenger time, and cargo time; (ii) value
of reduction in accidents and (iii) savings in work zone delays. Total net present value (NPV) of
economic benefits from the project is US$ 858 million, accrued over a period of 20 years. At an
investment of US$ 412 million, the net benefit is US$ 446 million. The economic internal rate of
return is 32.9 per cent per year (NDLI/LASA, 1998 a).
1.1.4 Phases of the Project
The project is to be implemented in three phases, viz. Phases I, IIA, and IIB. Phase I involves
widening and strengthening of 246.3km of state highways, whereas Phase IIA consists of
252.2km of state highways (the 65 km Mahesana- Palanpur corridor is common to both Phases
I and IIA: existing two-lane carriageway to be strengthened in Phase I, and a two-lane new
carriageway to be added in Phase IIA.).
The remaining 393.14km roads are part of the Phase IIB. The project is also divided into
contract packages. Each contract package is a group of project roads packaged together, to
make the individual contracts lucrative enough for international competitive bidding (Refer
Table 1.1).

Project preparation for Phase I and Phase IIA were completed by early 1998 and early 1999
respectively. Environmental and forestry clearances for Phase I of the project were obtained by
April 1998, while for the phase IIA these clearances were obtained by June 1999. Applications
for environmental and forestry clearance for Phase IIB have been submitted to the concerned
departments and the clearances are expected by December 1999.
1.2     Overview of GSHP: Phase IIB
Table 1.1 gives the listing of contract packages as originaIly planned to be implemented in
Phase IIB. The Phase IIB roads are tabulated in Table 1.2. The roads are distributed, leaving
the Katchchh area, over the entire state. With the exception of Corridors 15, 27 and 28, all
corridors traverse plain terrain. The terrain in Corridor 15 and Corridor 28 is slightly undulating.
Deleted as this road has been declared as part of a National Highway subsequent to completion of the feasibility
study (and SEA). The control of this road has been transferred to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

1.3 ROAD PROJECTS AND CULTURAL PROPERTIES
Besides, the archaeological and cultural properties in the vicinity and regional context
of the project corridors there are local community cultural resources such as temples
and shrines which share mutual interests with highways that enhances the quality of
experience. of highway travelling.
Perhaps the only feature that any traveller can identify with on an impersonal stretch
of a highway is a religious edifice. These structures are significant, because they
instantly conjure an image or impression of the place especially the social scenario
just as a specific architectural style can be attributed to a certain climate or place.
Cultural properties give a direct indication of the social quality of a place. The
number and typology of religious structures can be directly co-related to the religious
value of the place while the structures themselves can be indicators of the religion
prevailing in the area.
In road rehabilitation projects, people strongly feel that community assets especially
cultural properties might be threatened. Given their attachment to them, it becomes
imperative project, not only to protect but also to enhance, by reasonable means,
such assets. In fact, one of the significant findings of the primary survey of Phase IIB
was that the population was concerned about its adverse impacts on their community
resources, which primarily included their temples and shrines.
The Road Transportation sector has emerged as the spine of all industrial and
economic growth in the country. Any developmental activity is a collective process of
1-5                                                                            _



Gujarat State Hlghways Project: Phase II - Vol IIF
addressing many aspects of man made and natural environment. In fact, the report
of the World Commission on Culture and Development highlights the urgent need to
integrate cultural values into any and all attempts of development by focusing on the
investment in human development
In order to work on and meet the objective of sustaining cultural significance of the
place, it is important that under the Gujarat State Highways Project, identification of
the affected cultural assets is viewed as a vital aspect of this project. The project not
only attempts to identify all the community cultural resources affected by the project
in an effort to protect them but also to involve the community in an effort to infuse
greater meaning and beauty in the experience of travelling.
As part of the 6gen'da set by the World Bank and Government of Gujarat in Te(rms of
Reference towards protection and enhancement of cultural heritage, the approach on
the affected archaeological and cultural property is not only to examine what is
directly or physically affected by the project corridors under the Gujarat State
Highways Project, but also to focus on the cultural properties falling in the influence
region of the project corridors.
The identification and assessment process is meant to understand the nature of
impact and potential to realistically meet the agenda on protection and enhancement.
The approach is no way intends to reduce the scope or state that all the affected
cultural property would be protected and thereby provide a green signal towards
improvement of the project corridors.
Gujarat State, due to the presence of significant historical, traditional and cultural
value demands sensitive and sympathetic assessment of her cultural assets in the
process of inducting improvement or new development projects. These cultural assets
vary from small shrines to large archaeological sites of over 4000 years history. It is
a vital that the old and new are collectively assessed to sustain the cultural
significance of regions with strong traditional roots having contemporary relevance.

2. INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK
2.1 Background
India is known for its vast, diverse, and ancient cultural heritage. Every region in this
culturally rich continent has an identity of its own through the practice of various
traditions, and heritage inherited from previous generations in material and
metaphoric form. As a result of globalization and fast changing value systems in the
society, many serious issues related to loss of cultural heritage are raised.
Considering the depth of the culture and ancient traditions, the Constitution of India
under the fundamental duties, states: "it shall be the duty of every citizen of India to
value..and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture". Towards this concern
for the conservation of the rich heritage, both governmental and non-governmental
set-ups are growing and gearing up to meet the challenge to protect, use, and
enhance the areas of cultural significance.
2.2 INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
2.2.1 The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)
Archaeological Survey of India, which is the oldest organization in India concerning
conservation, continues to be the most important organization working on protection
and conservation of monuments and archaeological sites. The Archaeological Survey
of India is further supported by the state directorates of archaeology to protect
archaeological and cultural properties that are of regional significance.
The Archaeological Survey of India is looking into the interests of protecting cultural
heritage of National and International importance. There are 16 world heritage sites
in India, protected by the Archaeological Survey of India under the Ancient
Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958. Archaeological Survey of
India and the State Directorates of Archaeology protect only those properties that are
more than 100 years old and are of cultural significance to National, International,
and Regional society.
2.2.2 Non-Governmental Organizations
There are a number of non-governmental organizations working as pressure groups
and involved in conservation of cultural heritage in India. INTACH, Indian National
Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, Indian Heritage Society (IHS) and various local
2-1



Gujarat State Highways Project: Phase ZIB - Vol. IIF
and regional voluntary groups are actively involved in raising awareness on
conservation of cultural heritage in India.
INTACH was established .with the primary aim of preservation of India's rich and
diverse cultural heritage. INTACH is the main and most significant non-governmental
organization with regional chapters in most states and union territories of India. This
organization also acts as a reference for governmental agencies on conservation
issues.
Resource development, project formulation, taking action on protecting threatened
cultural properties on emergency basis is the key activities of INTACH. Over the years
INTACH has completed the listing of about 30,000 buildings in different parts of the
country (of which 815 are in Gujarat) not protected by the Department of
Archaeology, but which are part of the rich and varied heritage of the country.
2.3 LEGAL FRAMEWORK
As per the constitution of India the allocation of responsibility relating to the
enactment of legislation, administration and maintenance of ancient monuments and
archaeological sites and remains is as follows:
2.3.1   Central Legislation: The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological
Sites and Remains Act, 1958
The Act declares ancient monuments and antiquities as those, which have been in
existence for not less than one hundred years. As per this Act, Ancient and historical
monuments and records and archaeological sites and remains declared by or under
law made by Parliament will be of national importance Archaeological properties are
those cultural properties, that are protected under the Ancient Sites and Remains Act,
1958 by the GoG and the ASI.
The principal objectives of the Act are threefold:
* Preservation of monuments and sites of national importance
* Regulation of archaeological excavations
* Protection of sculptures etc
Today the number of centrally protected monuments stands around 5000 and the
state protected ones around 3000.

Chapter 2 - Insttutional and Legislative Framework
2.3.2   State Legislation: Gujarat Ancient Monuments and Archaeological
Sites and Remains Act, 1965
The Gujarat Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1965
extends to the whole of -Gujarat and has been framed to make better provisions for
the preservation of ancient and historical monument and records and archaeological
sites and remains (other than those declared to be of national importance) in the
State of Gujarat and for matters connectecl with the purposes aforesaid.
In Gujarat 212 monuments and sites are of national importance and 329 monuments
and sites of regional importance are protected by the ASI and the State Directorate
of Archaeology.
Further to this Act, as per notification dated 20th March 1995, the Government of
Gujarat declared areas 100m away from the limits of protected monuments, and upto
200m near or adjoining such monuments to be prohibited areas and regulated areas
for the purposes of mining and construction.

3. APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY
3.1 APPROACH
The approach to the affected archaeological and cultural property is not only meant
to protect those that are directly affected, but also to avoid indirect impacts on
cultural properties the extended or indirect area of influence. The guidelines laid
down by the WB provide significant avenues to care and protect areas of cultural
significance. The idea is not to make conservation, protection and enhancement as
exclusive processes, but to take up the task of protection and enhancement as part
of the project with broad intentions to improve the region.
In no way, the safeguard of cultural properties shall be at the cost of the
improvement of the project corridors and vice versa but the interest is to make sure
that cultural properties of varying importance are not considered as easy and soft
materials for shifting around while facilitating the highway-development.
3.2   Delineation of Influence Zones of the Project
A 10km wide strip on all sides of the corridor has been considered for identification of
the influence of the proposed widening on archaeological properties and protected
monuments. The study area is in accordance with the guidelines set down by the
Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF)) for Environmental clearance of Road
Projects. The field studies have been supplemented with secondary data from various
Government agencies and departments ancl other sources.
It was felt through experience from the two earlier (I & IIA) that the impact of the
proposed project is realistically speaking restricted to the ROW, the immediate
influence zone and the regional influence zone.  The study area was therefore
restricted in Phase IIB of the project to:
* The archaeological & cultural properties falling within RoW,
* The regional context of the project corridors that could benefit the areas of
greater cultural significance. Under this zone only and settlements and places
of great historical cultural and architectural significance have been inventoried
inside and just outside the Row and protected archaeological monuments and
sites, unto a range of 10 kms from the project corridor.

Gujarat State Highways Project. Phase JIB - Vol IIF
3.3 METHODOLOGY
The Cultural Impact Assessment has been conducted through the following
methodology.
3.3.1   Establishment of Cultural Baseline
The baseline data for the environmental components was collected through primary
surveys for collecting micro level data supplemented by secondary surveys. Strip
mapping carried along the project corridors was the main source of information, but
secondary sources of information, such as the ASI, the Gujarat State Directorate of
Archaeology, etc., were also consulted especially on identification and inventorisation
of archaeological properties. Amalgamation of data at micro and macro levels forms
the environmental' baseline status report. The baseline setting of cultural properties
has been presented in chapter 4 of this report.
3.3.2   Identification of Potential Impacts on Cultural Properties
Based on the interrelationship of the cultural properties with the highway the impacts
on the various environmental components, due to the proposed road widening were
analyzed. The impacts have been classified as insignificant/significant/major and
critical. Based on the type, nature and magnitude, impacts have been classified as
short-term, long-term, reversible and irreversible Impacts were analyzed for design,
pre-construction, construction and operation stages.
3.3.3   Avoidance and Mitigation of Impacts
Based on the significance of impacts and the significance of the cultural property,
avoidance and mitigation measures have been incorporated in the road design or at
other stages of construction as deemed feasible.
3.3.4   Enhancement Opportunities
Based on the baseline surveys enhancement opportunities for cultural properties were
identified to promote a feeling of respect for local residents' valuies and to provide
the road users with a more pleasing view.
3.3.5   Formulation of a Cultural Properties Management Plan
A plan has been formulated for mitigation or avoidance of each of the identified
negative impacts. The mitigation measures have been devised to mitigate impacts at
each stage of the project.

Yet another Saurashtra district, it links the area to Kachcch and the mainland.
Dhangadhra is an important industrial centre with pottery, chinaware and basic
chemicals.
4.2   Classification of Cultural Property
4.2.1 Archaeological Sites and Monuments
Gujarat gets its name from "Gujjar Rashtra", the land of the Gujjars, a migrant tribe
who came to India in wake of the invading Huns in the 5th century. The history of
Gujarat dates back to 2000 BC. Through the traditional practices and cross-cultural
influences during  the  long  history  of Gujarat State immense archaeological
environment can be experienced that qualifies the state as a region of special cultural
significance.
The significance of these places is gainincq ground to boost tourism in the state. In
the state of Gujarat 212 monuments and sites are of national importance and 329
monuments and sites of regional importance are protected by the ASI and the State
Directorate of Archaeology.
Archaeological properties are those cultural properties that are protected under the
Ancient Sites and Remains Act, 1958 by the GoG and the ASI. Map 1.1 shows the
Archaeological sites and monuments in the influence zone of the Phase-IIB corridors.
They merit significance because of the large volume of traffic that they generate.
Though these influences are restricted to a particular time they can contribute
inadvertently to the formation of bottlenecks, which seriously hamper the functioning
of the highway. That cultural properties do have far reaching consequences upon the
4-3



Chapter 4 - Cultural Context of the Corrldors
functioning of a highway has been amply proved in Phase IIA of the GSHP by the
temple of Ranchoddjji in Dakor.
The identification and assessment of cultural assets in GSHP are meant to explore
opportunities to facilitate areas and artifacts of cultural significance to be used by the
local communities, tourists, and the region as a whole. Categorization of the affected
cultural properties, based on their generic cultural and morphological properties
would help to prepare protection and enhancement agenda and plans.
4.2.2 Cultural Villages
Besides monuments and settlements of historical and architectural significance, the
living traditional practices in the smaller settlements or villages are no less significant
as these settlements collectively contribute to the cultural identity of the place and
are realistic interpretation of the ecology, local resources and cultural values
A cultural village can be defined as an area of special architectural, historical and/or
cultural interest, the character and appearance of which it is desirable to preserve
and enhance. These are areas, which afford a cultural and traditional identity to the
locality. Such areas can be large or small, whole towns, squares, groups of buildings
or streets or open spaces (village road interfaces in case of the GSHP) It is the
character of the area rather than the individual buildings themselves that are sought
to be preserved or enhanced by the GSHP. For e.g. an area will qualify to be a
cultural village on basis of say the 'ethnicity' of its inhabitants or the occupation of
the community which entails preservation from the influence of urbanization The
focus of enhancement of these cultural villages is on Indirect Conservation, which
entails protecting cultural character by controlling its environment. The intention is to
introduce adhesive or supportive fabric into the existing one in order to ensure its
structural integrity.
Due to variation in geographical and traditional practices, sub-cultural regions can be
delineated in Gujarat. In the light of these variations in geography and traditional
practices, Saurashtra, Kahchh, North and south Gujarat can be delineated as sub
cultural regions in Gujarat. The tribal culture can be experienced in North and South
Gujarat delineating these areas as completely distinct from the rest of the state. For
instance, the Dangs in South Gujarat and the tribals in Narmada Valley have very
distinct cultural practices and are well known for their rituals in the region. While
tribal cultures continue to sustain, various religions also continue to characterize the
cultural context of the state.

Gq)arat SRate Highwas Proje: Pae IIB - Vol. IF
In context to the GSHP the focus is enhancement of cultural villages lying in the ROW
ancd which can be said to be directly interacting with the corridor. Table 4.1 gives an
inventory of the settlements/villages on the Phase IIB corridors explored for their
cultural significance.

4.2.3 Shrines and Sacred Structures         _ 
Religious properties along the Phase IIB
corridors, in addition to the structures of
significant importance and scale, are the
large or small -(groups of) buildings or                                    1
features of interest. These areas and (_fgure 4.    tne as weIaI or Acddut Victm
elements impart a cultural and traditional identity to the local community. It is the
character, rather than size and mass of the built structures, that needs preservation
or enhancement. Religious properties in GSHP are an essential component of the road
development scheme such that these areas while remaining vibrant, maintain their
character besides promoting visual experience for the highway users.



Chapter 4 - Dutural Gontext of the Gonidors
Cultural heritage depletes due to ignorance, lack of users and inadequate
maintenance. Conservation of cultural assets is very critical towards preserving
cultural heritage. The GSHP by adopting indirect conservation measures / schemes
seeks to incorporate supportive fabrics into the existing arena of cultural properties
along Phase IIA corridors.
A total of hundred fourteen properties have been identified the corridor. Out of these
fifty seven are shrines, thirty nine are temples, eight are dargah or mosques, while
nine are graveyards. The cultural properties' along Phase-IIA corridors, have been
categorized as
Shrines - miniaturised form of temples,
memorial, tombs or objects of sacred
value that are too small to enter.
Shrines have been categorized on basis
of site survey as guardians to the

mostly of private ownership, in other
cases shrines are dedicated to the
victim of road accidents.

shrines is generally very localised and

This category encompasses temples, mosques, dargah, churches,stepwells memorials,
burial grounds, cenotaphs and tombs. Many of the temples within the RoW have
evolved from shrines. They generally belong to the community or to Trusts in some
cases and it is difficult to relocate them. Many of these structures are large and
disrupt the road use.

of the towers. The towers are square and massive. With
the massive structure and small tops, the mosque has a
appearance different from that of the usual mosque with
minarets. The most impressive and unique feature of this
mosque is a great Mihrab (Arch) Most of it has given way,
except small portion attached to the south-eastern tower.
iThere is a belief that 200-ft. long brick arch was
suspended in air. It appears that the whole edifice was a

which are Shiv, Yogi, and goddess.
4.3.1.2 Cultural Villages on the Corridor
The Dholka Bagodra corridor is lined with fertile agricultural land on both sides. The
only settlement, which is away from the corridor, and is near Dholka town, does not
seem to have any distinct 'cultural' features.
4.3.1.3 Shrines and Sacred Structures
There are a total of eight cultural properties on this corridor of which three are
shrines, two are temples, one is an religious centre (ashram) and the remaining two
are an crematorium and an graveyard. The incidence of cultural properties is 0.357
properties per km. Table 4.4 lists the shrines and sacred structures on the corridor.

Over 90%    of the households on this corridor are hindus which explains the high
incidence of temples and shrines. Of the total 12 cultural properties 5 are temples, 5
are shrines and the remaining are a graveyard and a Dargah. The incidence rate of
cultural properties is 0.495 properties per km. The following table 4.11 lists down the

Chapter 4 - Cultural Context of the Corrldors
4.3.6.2 Cultural Villaaes
This corridor is noted for its clay products especially Morbi which is famous all over
India for its Morbi tiles. Households do thrive on pottery making on this corridor at
Sakzat Sanada village (km 58) but these activities are haphazardly scattered. The
corridor is lined with pottery wares displayed for sale at numerous locations
especially in urban settlements. Though this is a traditional occupation no area or
settlement was observed to be so involved as to qualify to be so involved as to
qualify as a cultural village of sorts. The other settlements on the corridor Bedi (km
3) Louridhar (km 6) Mitana (km 31) show urban influence owing to their proximity to
these two urban centres.
4.3.6.3 Raikot - Morbi
There are a total of twenty-five cultural 'propertiese:on this 68.2 km stretch of the
corridor yielding an average incidence rate of 0.351 cultural properties per km. The
break down is 8 temples, 112 shrines, 3 Dargahs, and 2 graveyards and one stepwell.
The high incidence of Hindu structures is consistent with the Hindu dominated
population (87.32%) of the households are Hindu). The shrines are mostly located
on the edge of the fields (agriculture, is the predominant landuse along the corridor).
The ancient step well on the edge of the road at chainage 57.26 adds an interesting
dimensions to travel along this corridor. Sadly, it is a state of utter neglect and if
conserved (as it is more than 100 years old) could be an interesting sight on the
corridor.

This 24 km long corridor is devoid of habitation except at village Motibaru. There are
only five small cultural properties on this corridor, but it is significant because it
provides road access to in Lothal, the famous Harappan site. The temple of Bhavani
on the corridor also seems to be more than 100 years old.

4.3.9.1Cultural Villages
The Bharuch - Dahej corridor is predominated by muslims from km 39 to km 47. On
this corridor are located residential colonies of IPCL and BHEL. Kantharia junction is
predominantly commercial. The inhabitants of village Bhenseli (k 17.5) are involved in
agriculture. Other than this there are big landed properties on the corridor.          No
cultural   significance or activities is activity is attributed  to this corridor or its
influence zone.
4.3.9.2Shrines and sacred structures
The big mosque at Ch 40 outside the RoW aptly justifies the muslim dominated
population along the corridor. Other than this, all theb   other cultural properties are
small.shrines-seemingly isolated..There are a total of.6 shrines-and .one graveyard on
this corridor. The low incidence of cultural properties (0.148 per km) can be
attributed to the very less signs of habitation on either side of the corridor.

4.4 APPROACH
The approach to the affected archaeological and cultural property is not only meant
to protect those that are directly affected, but also to avoid indirect impacts on
cultural properties the extended or indirect area of influence. The guidelines laid
down by the WB provide significant avenues to care and protect areas of cultural
significance. The idea is not to make conservation, protection and enhancement as
exclusive processes, but to take up the task of protection and enhancement as part
of the project with broad intentions to improve the region.
In no way, the safeguard of cultural properties shall be at the cost of the
improvement of the project corridors and vice versa but the interest is to make sure
that cultural properties of varying importance are not considered as easy and soft
materials for shifting around while facilitating the highway development.
4.5    Delineation of Influence Zones of the Project
A 10km wide strip on all sides of the corridor has been considered for identification of
the influence of the proposed widening on archaeological properties and protected
monuments. The study area is in accordance with the guidelines set down by the
Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF)) for Environmental clearance of Road
4-21



Chapter 4 - Cultural Context of the Corndors
Projects. The field studies have been supplemented with secondary data from various
Government agencies and departments and other sources.
It was felt through experience from the two earlier (I & IIA) that the impact of the
proposed project is realistically speaking restricted to the ROW, the immediate
influence zone and the regional influence zone.  The study area was therefore
restricted in Phase IIB of the project to:
* The archaeological & cultural properties falling within RoW,
. The regional context of the project corridorss that could benefit the areas of
greater cultural significance. Under this zone only and settlements and places
of great historical cultural and architectural.significance have been inventoried
insid.e, and just. outside the .Row and protected archaeological monuments and.
sites, unto a range of 10 kms from the project corridor.
4.6 METHODOLOGY
The Cultural Impact Assessment has been conducted through the following
methodology.
4.6.1   Establishment of Cultural Baseline
The baseline data for the environmental components was collected through primary
surveys for collecting micro level data supplemented by secondary surveys. Strip
mapping carried along the project corridors was the main source of information, but
secondary sources of information, such as the ASI, the Gujarat State Directorate of
Archaeology, etc., were also consulted especially on identification and inventorisation
of archaeological properties. Amalgamation of data at micro and macro levels forms
the environmental baseline status report. The baseline setting of cultural properties
has been presented in chapter 4 of this report.
4.6.2   Identification of Potential Impacts on Cultural Properties
Based on the interrelationship of the cultural properties with the highway the impacts
on the various environmental components, due to the proposed road widening were
analyzed. The impacts have been classified as insignificant/significant/major and
critical. Based on the type, nature and magnitude, impacts have been classified as
short-term, long-term, reversible and irreversible Impacts were analyzed for design,
pre-construction, construction and operation stages.

Gujarat State Hlghways Project. Phase IIB - Vol. IIF
4.6.3   Avoidance and Mitigation of Impacts
Based on the significance of impacts and the significance of the cultural property,
avoidance and mitigation measures have been incorporated in the road design or at
other stages of construction as deemed feasible.
4.6.4   Enhancement Opportunities
Based on the baseline surveys enhancement opportunities for cultural properties were
identified to promote a feeling of respect for local residents' values and to provide
the road users with a more pleasing view.
4.6.5   Formulation of a Cultural Properties Management Plan
A plan has been formulated for mitigation or avoidance of each of -the identified
negative impacts. The mitigation measures have been devised to mitigate impacts at
each stage of the project.

5. IMPACT IDENTIFICATION
Impacts of Phase-II B on cultural properties will be mostly direct, as the roads are already in
operation. The impacts have been classified as insignificant/significant/major and critical. Based on
the type, nature and magnitude, impacts have been classified as short-term, long-term, reversible
and irreversible. Impacts were analyzed for design, pre-construction, construction and operation
stages. The impacts may be positive as well as negative depending upon the interaction between
the cultural property and the highway corridor. One of the major finding of the Socio-economic
survey (community consultation programs) wasthat 66 per cent of the likely PAPs were concerned
about loss of community assets, which includedccultural properties.
5.1. IMPACT IDENTIFICATION
An Impact Identification-Matrix has been used to assess the significance and magnitude of the
impacts of the proposed project. The matrixinvolves the understanding of cause, condition, effect
relationships between the project activity and environmental indicators for identification of impacts.
The significance of Impacts has been rated as insignificant/significant/major and critical. Based on
the magnitude the impacts have been classified as short term and long term, irreversible and
reversible.
Impacts on the cultural environment have been identified for four stages of the project as and
when they occur, namely
Planning and Design Stage
Pre-Construction Stage
Construction Stage, and
Road Operation Stage
5.2.   IMPACT ZONES
Depending upon the degree of impact of the proposed road rehabilitation on the cultural properties
the RoW has been delineated into three impact zones namely
*      High impact zone (0- 5 m)
*      Medium impact zone (5 - 10 m)
*      Low impact zone (10 m - RoW)

Chapter S - Impact Identificatlon
The high impact zone as the name signifies, means a maximum adverse impact zone on the
cultural properties. On basis of field trips, prior experiences and discussions this nomendature has
been designated to the liner strip of 5m width on either side of the carriageway starting from its
edges. Impacts in this zone can be irreversible such as damage to the structures. Impact in the
medium zone tends towards disruption of the environment of the cultural property especially
during the construction phase. Impacts can also be irreversible such as damage during
construction or operation phase. Properties in the low impact zone might be subjected to the
impacts that can be summed up as temporary or reversible impacts. Impacts could be induced
such as increased dust noise etc. Impacts in these zones have been highlighted in the matrix in
Table 2.1.
5.3. IMPACTS ON CULTURAL "PROPERTIES
No protected monument is located within 300 m of a Phase IIB road. Consequently, the restrictive
provisions of the Archaeological Sites and Remains Act are not activated
As described in the above table the impacts will vary depending upon the location or proximity of
the property to the corridor. The project attempts to quantify beforehand the no of properties
being subjected to various impacts in order to arrive at a tentative estimate to mitigate the impacts
of the proposed road rehabilitation. It is possible that the impacts may vary during the actual
design. Following is a phase wise description of likely major impact of Phase IIB. Table 5.1
presents the likely impacts of Phase IIB in a matrix

Gujarat State Highways Project: Phase IIB - Vol. IF
5.3.1.        Damage to Cultural Assets
5.3.1.1. Pre Construction Stage
Cultural properties lying in the high impact zone are most susceptible to impacts due to pre
cohstruction and construction activities. Clearing of the site during Movement of road construction
machinery is likely to require a belt of about 4-5rn from the edge of the carriageway, which is likely
to adversely impact cultural properties especially lying in the- high impact zone. Pre-Construction
could also involve cutting down of sacred trees if they are located in the Col.
5.3.1.2. Construction Stage
Construction Stage, which involves not only the actual road construction process but also allied
activities such as movement of heavy road machinery, hauls vehicles etc. as well. These heavy
vehicles need a belt of about 5m on the roadside for movement. Also mixing etc activities need
space along the road edge. All similar activities are likely to damage religious structures located in
the RoW, especially shrines which are not always in the line of sight.
5.3.1.3. Operation Stage
Traffic Volumes and vehicles speeds are bound to increase after the proposed widening. As the
widening could mean curtailing of the of access way of religious properties, shrines and other
religious structures in the RoW / COI are likely to be exposed to collision risk especially during
night. One of the adverse impacts of the road rehabilitation project on the cultural property located
along the road edge is increased risk of damage to the property due to likely vehicular collision.
5.3.2.        Contamination of site
5.3.2.1. Pre Construction
One of the adverse impacts during construction is -rne lKeiinooa or mne precinct or the cultural
property being contaminated by activities associated with road construction activities of the site
being contaminated by spillage of oil, tar, etc. All the cultural properties located in the medium
RoW are likely to be subjected to these impacts in varying degrees. Properties risk being affected
by spills of oils, tar or other liquids, etc. One of the adverse impacts during construction is the
likelihood of the precinct of the cultural property being contaminated by activities associated with
road construction activities of the site being contaminated by spillage of oil, tar, etc. All the cultural
properties located in the medium RoW are likely to be subjected to these impacts in varying
degrees. Properties risk being affected by spills of oils, tar or other liquids, etc.
5.3.2.2. Construction Stage
The issue of Contamination of Site is significant at the construction stage of the project.
Construction stage involves a lot of movement of vehicles, tankers etc. Vehicle servicing stations
would have to be set up on the site itself for regular maintenance and cleaning of the vehicles.



Chapter 5 - Impact Identitfcation
Servicing /maintenance of these vehicles is likely to create oil spills etc. In addition the setting up
of construction /labor camps is likely to add to the problem if proper sanitary conditions are not
maintained at the site. The Cultural Management Plan must ensure that proper sanitary conditions
are maintained at locations of cultural properties.
5.3.2.3. Oneration Stage
There is likelihood of contamination of the site during the operation stage only in case of accidental
oil spills or road accidents involving tankers etc. However, it is envisaged that improved road
geometrics, especially improved pavement conditions would mitigate this issue to a larger extent.

5.3.3.        Pollution
5.3.3.1. Pre Construction Stage
There is also likelihood of pollution impacts during pre- construction activities. Site clearing
activities are estimated to generate a lot of dust. Although this is a direct impact it would last only
for the duration of the activity.
5.3.3.2. Construction Staae
Cultural properties are likely to be adversely impacted during this stage the structure may be
impacted by dust'generated during the construction stage. Movement of heavy machinery and
vibratory compactors alongside the road could cause vibration, which is likely towunsettle the
foundation or.'structure of some of the cultural properties (buildings). Cultural properties in all the
impact zone,.willibe subjected to air and noise pollution.
5.3.3.3. ODeration Staae
Due to the road rehabilitation project the pollution load on the roadside cultural properties is likely
to increase due to the increased road traffic. The increased vehicular traffic is likely to mean
increased vibration impacts as also increased air and noise pollution along the roadside areas. The
impact of pollution maybe negligible or difficult to quantify but it is necessary to foresee the likely
impact of pollution on cultural properties. Although pollution during the operation stage is a long
term and irreversible impact, it is envisaged that better pavement quality and improved speeds
would remove congestion and frequent breaking of vehicles and thus indirectly reduce noise and
dust pollution effectively.
5.3.4.        Loss/Disruption of Access
5.3.4.1. Pre Construction
One of the impacts of road construction, which is also a subset of the above impacts, is interrupted
access to the cultural property. There are chances that users of the cultural property may face
difficulty in accessing the property during the period of pre- construction. Increased frequency of
movement of haul vehicles may obstruct access to the cultural properties located in the RoW. This
impact is however short term.
5.3.4.2. Construction Stage
Loss of Access is likely to be severe during the construction period, due to movement of
construction machinery, construction and labour camps or setting up of borrow areas, setting up of
service stations etc.
5.3.4.3. Operation Stage
Loss/Disruption of Access is envisaged in cases of land acquisition or severance of land. In case of
the proposed road widening the road widening may take up part or whole of the approach to the

property thus making it vulnerable in terms of its safety or accessing it. The widening process will
bring the
5.3.5.        Loss of Ambience
5.3.5.1. Pre Construction
Pre-Construction activities, namely site clearance is likely to disturb the environment of the
property. Though loss of ambience in this stage is a short-term impact it could directly affect the
functioning of the cultural property.
5.3.5.2. Construction Stage
Road Construction and Allied activities involve constant generation . of dust, noise and
esta.k isIrment of heavy vehicles on the site. Generation of such activity is.4d!ky, to lead to loss of
ambience of the environment of the Cultural Property.
5.3.5.3. Operation Staae
The road rehabilitation project may affect the frequency of use of the cultural property and its
surroundings. Increased traffic may lead,to commercial use of the roadside area of which the
cultural area might be a part. Increase in these kinds of activities might destroy the ambience of
several cultural properties in addition to compounding parking and encroachment problems which
could lead to a loss of ambience of the Cultural; Property.
5.4. CORRIDOR WISE IMPACTS ON CULTURAL PROPERTIES:
5.4.1.        Corridor 10: Vadodra - Padra - Jambusar
This is as mentioned earlier the most sensitive corridor in terms of environmental impact. Of the
total 26 properties on this corridor 5 lie in the high impact zone, 10 in the medium impact zone
and 11 in the low impact zone.

5.5. CULTURAL HOTSPOTS
A hotspot is a location when several environmental constraints co exist usually in the high or
medium impact zone. A cultural hotspot is a hotspot at which one of the constraints is a cultural
property.
II. 10                                                                                                   5-10



Gujarat State Hlghwyvs Project: Phase IIB - Vol. IIF
The following locations/urban stretches can be classified as hotspots on basis of the primary
survey and strip mapping and give rise to som,e sensitive issues mentioned later. These locations
qualify as hotspots not only on an individual basis but also seem to be significant, keeping in mind
the overall social, cultural and natural scenario. A location having a cultural property close enough
to be adversely impacted becomes a hotspot not only by virtue of its individual significance but
also because of its immediate social and natural environ. For e.g. a significant cultural property on
one side of-the road and a water body on the opposite edge of the road or presence of an urban
settlement needs further evaluations to assess the scene in totality. The temple of Mahadev at Ch
9.88 at the right of the corridor qualifies as a hotspot. It is located at the edge of the road on a
pond side. On the opposite side of the road is the settlement of SamjaIa.
5.5.1.        Categorisation of homogenous sections
Although the impacts on cultural properties during construction have,been addressed earlier the
issue of what happens during construction phase needs to be visualized separately as this involves
a concentrated flow of diversion traffic and movement of heavy and large construction machinery.
The space required for diversion and movement of construction machinery could be as much as
5m or even more depending upon circumstantial evidence.
In order to minimize the impacts during construction, it is essential to divide the entire corridor into
homogenous sections, which will minimize the overall impacts due to the proposed road
rehabilitation.
It is to be noted that these homogenous sections have been identified on basis of location of
cultural properties only and may need to be revised in conjunction with the social and
environmental scenario of the corridor.

Chapter S - Impact Identification
From table 2.13  it is evident most of the cultural properties are located on the right side of the
corridor in the high impact zone, which is most susceptible to road rehabilitation. It seems feasible
to plan diversion of traffic on the left side of the corridor.
5.5.2.        ISSUES
The study brings forth certain issues major among which are the following two:
5.5.2.1. Cultural properties on public land
One unique finding on the Vadodra -Padra Jambusar corridor was that the shrine at Ch 9.5 was
built as a pretext to encroach upon the site and use it for informal parking. This is the only
recorded case of such behaviour for Phase IIB. This input from one of the local resident's raises
the sensitive issue of encroachment by religious properties on roadways lands, which acquires an
altogether new dimension because of the religious implications.
5.5.2.2. Relocation of Cultural Properties
The survey also tried to evaluate the possibility of relocation during the primary survey stage itself.
Possibility of relocation for cultural priorities in the high impact zone was explored issues as these
properties are most likely to be subjected to relocation. Some interesting observations were made.
In case of community properties, especially in urban areas responses were divided and also non
commital. Community consultation will be required in such cases to know the opinion of the people
Yet another interesting observation was that in rural areas people were not willing to shift their
cultural properties which played the role of the'village guardian'.
It is stressed that relocation shall be resorted to only when all other mitigation and avoidance
measures are not feasible.

6.     AVOIDANCE AND MITIGATION OF IMPACTS
Cultural and archaeological properties were identified depending upon their relationship with
the road corridor. Some of these are likely to be impacted. The impacts may vary from
property to property and with time during the road construction and operation phases. The
impacts have been identified in order to find location-specific solutions to avoid or mitigate
possible damages to the cultural properties.
Priority will be given to avoidance of adverse impacts on cultural properties by modifying the
road design where an impact cannot be avoided. -The following table .6. 1 describes in a matrix
form issue based specific avoidance and mitigation measures.

6.1.1 Avoidance of impact on cultural property
6.1.1.1 Realignment of the pavement
This is the first option exercised to avoid impact to the cultural property. The proposed road
alignment will be laterally changed to shift the road away from the carriageway in order to
minimise or avoid adverse impact to the cultural.

6.1.1.2 Restriction of Pavenment Width
It is not always feasible to realign the carriageway to avoid impacts to a aultuiral property,
especially in case of non-availability of land especially in urban oorridors where there are RoW
constraints as well as commercial and other types of encroachment. In such cases here is no
altemaffve but to restrict the width of the carriageway. This option will be resorted to only in
case of sensitive features on either side of the carriageway.

6.1.2 Provision of Retaining Wall
As mentioned below the mitigation measure of relocation of the cultural property has been
resorted to only as a last option and is only considered in case of small shrines. For larger
structures such as temples and mosques that are located on the immediate edge of the
carriageway; the provision of retaining wall to restrict the width of the proposed road
embankment will be one of,the optipns to save the cultural property in question.

6.2 Mitigation of impact on cultural property
6.2.1 Redefining Access to the Cultural Property
It has been observed that some cultural properties are being accessed from the road, thereby
endangering the safety of users. Moreover, the related activities spill on to the road space,
disrupting the fast moving traffic. In such instances, the major entry will be relocated to the
side. The original entry will be retained but its use will be restricted by means of a protective
barrier, which will prevent activities from spilling on to the road space. This mitigation measure
is symbiotic as it benefits the highway and the temple user.

6.2.3  *      Rellcation of the cultural property
Relocation is the last option, which is to be carried out in consultation wimtn tne concemed
community and only for very small shrines. Depending upon design imperatives such as
available width of the carriageway, requisite design speeds at vertical and horizontal aurves
cultural properties in dose proximity to the road corridor are subjected to hazard from
speeding vehides. In such instances, after making a thorough comparison of the costs involved
in changing road alignments with the religious significance and uiltural importance of the
cultural property, relocation of the property in question is recommended.

6.2.4  *      Landscaping
Trees will be planted along the,roadside to protect cultural significant areas from the adverse
impacts of noise and dust pollution. Trees give shade to both the road users and the users of
the cultural property.
Hard landscaping measures such as a slightly raised curb to form a segregation zone between
the road and the cultural property on the road edge is an effective method of creating visual as

6.2.5  *       Use of Caubionary Measures
In some instances Cultural properties do not qualify for enhancement but are located dose to
the corrdor. The use of hazard markers at such locations will caution approadhing vehides
about the structure well in advance. Spedific mitigation and avoidance measures adopted for
cultural properties on basis of their location and the impacts that they are subjected have been
descnbed earlier. Cultural properties, which have mitigation, and avoidance measures applied
to them have been discussed in the section in the chapter on enhancement of Cultural
Properties. Wherein both issues have been addressed collectively and design solutions can be
both mitigabion as well as enhancement oriented.

Chapter - 6: Avoidarce & Mitigation of Impact
6.3 Criteria for Mitigation
In the final road design, it is not always possible to avoid all the cultural properties. Often there
has to be a compromise in the larger interest of the society to achieve good geometric design
etc. Although the emphasis of the project is to avoid as many cultural properties as possible,
mitigation is often resorted to as the second resort. Properties, which are considered for
mitigation, are:
* Properties, which cannot be avoided completely by the road design, are considered for
mitigation
* Properties in the RoW, espedally in the CoI are considered for mitigation. Properties
located within the edge of the Carriageway and till the end of the CoI, especially qualify
for mitigation
* Extent of mitigation depends upon the significance and level of impacts on the
concemed property.
* The type of mitigation measure applied again depends on the significance of the
property and its proximity to the road.
6.4 Safety/Precautionary/Cautionary Measures for Mitigation of impacts.
Locations where hazard markers are proposed to be put up are listed in Table 6.2. The hazard
mnarkers will be put up at the location at the edge of the usable shoulder. Hazard markers will
be especially helpful where the road geometry is poor such as at sharp horizontal curves.
The shrine on the Vadodra - Padra -
Jambusar corridor located at a sharp
horizontal curve is not visible to
approaching vehides and comes into view
abruptly endangering the shrine and its
-   This small shrine at Ch 23.05 stands on
the inside of a horizontal curve' of the
Shrine at ch. 23.05 on Vadodara -i-adra -Jambusar  corridor. As this well maintained shrine
stands vulnerably just on the edge of the
corridor the only suitable solution seems to be re-align the centreline of the corridor away from
the structure and put up a hazard marker at the location. There is not space to put up a
protective railing. Hazard rmarkers will be effective in such cases.

6.5 Relocation
Although relocation is the best possible option to clear the RoW, it is not always possible to
avoid all the cultural properties. vVherever such relocation of cultural and religious properties
are not possible for relocation, in the larger interests of the society it is more important to have
roads with good geometric design in all respects. Although the project has tried to minimize
damaging any of the cultural properties, it has not been teasible to save some of the
properties.

7.       ENHANCEMENT OF CULTURAL PROPERTIES
The aim of the enhancement of Cultural Properties is to promote qualitative development and
infuse greater meaning in the road environment. Its secondary objective is:
.  To beautify and enhance the experience of travelling by beautifying the
cultural assets of the highway
a  To restrict the cultural properties from further encroaching upon the RoW, and
also.
*  To develop some cultural properties as rest areas so that the road travelers
and local community benefit from them.
To forms of enhancement selected are influenced by the location f cultural properties and their
physical relationship with the corridor. Measures that are maintenance free and functional have
been proposed.
7.1 ENHANCEMENT MEASURES
Every effort has been made to employ local materials including Stone in the Jetpur-Junagarh
corridor. Bricks and tiles in Viramgam - Dhangadhra-Halvad corridor Stone is also available
here. The existence of 5 brick kilns in the Dhoka-Bagodra corridor means brick is easily
available here. Black stone is easily available, due to the presence of 7-8 quarries, on the
Jamnagar-Khamballa corridor. Morvi on the Rajkot-Morvi. Using local reduces costs and retains
the vernacular block of the corridor issue based enhancement in Table 7.1
7.1.1 PROVIDING AND/OR IMPROVING ACCESS
Shrines along highways are often isolated from the surrounding environs. Depending upon site-
specific situations the project will strive to improve access to these properties by providing
walkways from the highway. Locally available materials will be preferred and using different
paving patterns and materials will create interesting ground surfaces. The intention is to enrich
the roadside places.
7.1.2 IMPROVING, DEFINING, REDEFINING THE PRECINCTS
In addition to providing access emphasis will be given to defining the precinct or area of
immediate influence of the property. Hard landscaping measures a described earlier will be
used in continuation with the access pathway to form the precinct of the structure. Particular
attention will be paid entry areas of cultural properties.
7-1



Gopirat Slate Highways Project PhaselJIB - Vol I/F
7.1.3 CREATING SEATING SPACES AND REST AREA
Formal or informal seating and rest areas adopted to scale of the property will be done. The
project will explore avenues for creation of rest areas along the highway. Rest areas will be
developed especially temples where space and drinking water are available.
7.1.4 PLANTATION
Trees not only enrich the visual quality of a space but also act as buffer to pollution, define
areas and provide shade. Plantation of trees is a prime enhancement as well as mitigation
measure in the project. Tree bases will be built around existing as well as proposed shade trees
to form informal seating spaces, which are evidently preferred to the formal seating spaces.
7.1.5 OTHERS
Minor improvements such as proposed shade trees to provide informal sealing spaces, which
are evidently preferred to the formal ones. Plastering and whitewashing shrines will be
considered Zebra crossings and signage will also considered. Issues based enhancement
measures have been presented in a matrix form in table.

7.2 SCREENING FOR ENHANCEMENT
Phase 115 has screened all the Cultural Properties and enhanced selected cultural properties
based on the significance of the cultural property. The significance of the cultural property has
been decided on basis of the primary survey. The aspect of assigning a particular signiflcance
to any cultural property is quite a subjective task in itself and difficult to quantify. Yet the
project makes an attempt to try to bring these values to a common platform in order to select

properties to be enhanced. The significance of a certain property comes into question when
deciding the mitigation, avoidance or enhancement level to be applied to it. This does not
mean that one cultural property is superior to another for e.g. A small shrine may not be
significance enough to warrant realignment of the corridor and from its significance value a
particular mitigation measure could be most: appropriate for it. The cultural properties were
evaluated on basis of several factors. In addition some thumb rules have been adopted for
sake of simplicity. Private shrines or properties taken care of by trusts etc. will not be enhanced
as the project focuses on the overall benefit of the society. Shrines, which even though located
in the CoI but built as homage to victims of road accidents have not been selected for
enhancement for the same reason state above. Significance of all the cultural properties has
been determined on basis of the following criteria.
7.2.1 SIZE
Size of the cultural property is not an indicator of its significance but it becomes important in
terms of "relocation". Such as is quite easy to relocate a shrine, but more the issue is complex
in case of bigger properties such as temples, wherein the cost of reconstruction and cost of
acquisition of land, need to be considered. Cultural properties have been categorized as small
(upto 1.5 m x 1.5 m), medium (upto 4m x 4 m) and large (above 4 m x 4m)
7.2.2 BUILDING MATERIAL
Materials used to build cultural properties are an indication of its significance. The properties
have been classified in terms of Pucca, semi-pucca and Kaccha
7.2.3 VALUE
Three types of value have been assigned to the cultural property-emotional, cultural and use
value. While the emotional value may not be quantitative the use value can be judged from
siting and use of the property by the conimunity. Cultural properties sometimes assume
importance because of their location and proximity to other community resources such as a
well, a big shade tree, the village bust stop or common gathering space. In such instances
relocating the cultural property also destroy its ambience. Social importance attached to the
cultural property have been categorised as Significance, Average and Poor.
7.2.4 OWNERSHIP
We feel that it is fair to assume that benefits to large segments of society are more important
than those to a single individual or smaller segment. Community cultural resources have
therefore been given preference over private ones only in terms of enhancement. Equal merit
has been given to both in mitigation and avoidance of impacts. The significance to the
community has been determined on the basis of ownership (public, private or trust) and use.
Using the preceding criteria the following properties in Table 7.2 qualify for enhancement.

Ch- 74.1, Hanuman Shrines
Local residents frequent this medium sized shrine on the edge of an agricultural field very
often. Since it is located .in the RoW, the structure and its users will be in danger due to vehicle
movement. Also given its significance to the community it is proposed to rehabilitate the
existing paved frontage and to erect a protective metal barrier. A hazard marker will also
indicate its presence, especially during night. Refer Drg. 7.2.

Ch-77.0, Mahadev Temple
This temple located 10.98m away from the centre of the road is the node or community
gathering space of the surrounding settlement. Un-maintained hedges that detract from its
ambience demarcate its entrance. It is proposed to redefine this front boundary by means of a
metal railing, which will also enhance the purpose of safety. The length of this new frontage
will be. equal to the length of the existing liedge. The enhancement measure will not only
improve the visibility of the temple from the road, but also defer any kind of future expansion
by the temple towards the roadside. Refer. Drg. 7.3.

Ch-91.37, Hanuman Temple
This brightly painted medium sized temple of the monkey god 'Hanuman' is located on the very
edge of the corridor, at Vadal. Behind it is an arcade of commercial activity. The structure is
exposed to the risk of collision with speeding vehicles. Its plinth on the road ward size is used
as a sitting platform by the local person waiting for the buses, which endangers their life. The
mitigation measures are to extend the existing railing on the road ward side of the temple.
Gaps will be left in the railing so the local residents can continue using the plinth for seating
with reduced damages. Refer Drg 7.4.

0 Ch. - 3.2, Khodiyar ma shrine
This well maintained shrine is 3.2 m from the edge of the road. Regular Puja or religious prayers
are offered here in the dense shade of a neem tree. The proposed enhancement consists of
building low height brick lining on either side of the shrine so its space horizontally
simultaneously for seating as well as a deter the shrine from expanding. In addition, a metal
railing, painted with reflectorised paint, will warn road users of the cultural property near
vicinity. Refer Drg. 7.5.

the shrine will also be cleared, leveled and compacted to define its use area. Keeping in view
its significance to the community, a small seating space in the form of a low brick parapet is
also proposed. The seating is expected to curtail the expansion of the shrine along the road.

Ch. 57.26, StepWell
This ancient stone lined stepwell close to the road is in a state of disuse and disrepair. The age
of the structure is probably more than 100 years. Despite its proximity, it is almost from the
corridor, because of the dense undergrowth and shrubbery that surrounds it. The project
attempts to treat the surrounding of the structure sensitively without physically impacting the
stepwell. It is proposed to clear an area of about 4 m on all sides of the stepwell and till the
edge of the road. In addition a liner area for about 20 m on either side of the stepwell is also
proposed to be cleared to improve the visibility of this structure. It is proposed to outline the
property with a band or brick paving to highlight the structure as well as facilitate visitors to
walk around the structure. A metal railing will also frame the paving to demarcate the area. It
is proposed to also put up a signboard to highlight the details and age of the structure. It is
proposed to build a paved access to the structure from the road.
