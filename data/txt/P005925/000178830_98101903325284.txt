APPRAISAL OF THE EL CHOCON PROJECT
HIDROEILECTRICA NORPATAGONICA S.A.
SUMMARY
i.          The Government of Argentina has applied to the Bank for a loan
to finance part of the foreign exchange costs of the El Chocon Project.
This Project is part of the first stage of the Chocon-Cerros Colorados
multi-purpose development (CCC) for the upper Rio Negro valley.   The
Project consists of: a dam on the Rio Limay; a power station with an
initial capacity of 600 Mw; and a 500 kv transmission line to Buenos Aires.
ii.         The Borrower would be Hidroelectrica Norpatagonica S.A. (Hidro-
nor) a corporation recently established to carry out CCC.  The Government
must at all times hold the majority of shares; no shares have yet been sold
to the public.
iii.        The estimated total cost of the Project, including interest
during construction, is US$325 million equivalent of which about US$145
million is foreign exchange. The total cost of the CCC complex is estima-
ted at US$544 million equivalent. The proposed Bank loan would cover about
60% of the foreign cost of the Project.
iv.         The CCC complex is well planned and would meet the forecast
power growth of the Buenos Aires area from 1973 through 1978. In addition
to electric power benefits, the complex would provide immediate flood
control of the Rio Negro, and in later years small irrigation benefits.
v.          The financing plan is satisfactory, but is dependent on the
success in obtaining buyer credits from several foreign countries. Letters
of intent have already been received from nine countries expressing their
willingness to participate in the financing. The Government will provide
all the required local funds and also whatever additional funds may be
needed if any part of the expected financing from foreign countries does
not materialize.
vi.         Under its concession, Hidronor is entitled to earn an 8% return
on the sum of:  (a) its gross fixed assets in operation; and (b) 4% of (a)
for working capital requirements. This return would assure Eidronor suf-
ficient revenues to meet its financial obligations. The forecasts show
that Hidronor should be able to maintain a satisfactory financial condition
in the future.
vii.        Hidronor would be a suitable Borrower for a Bank loan of US$82.0
million equivalent with a term of twenty-five years, including a grace period
of six years. The loan would not be effective until the conditions listed
in paragraph 8.06 are met.



ARGENTINA
APPRA!SAL OF THE EL CEOCON PROJECT
HIDROELECTRICA NORPATAGONICA S.A.
1.   INTRODUJCTION
1.01        The Government of Argentina has decided to construct a multi-
purpose development in the Patagonia on the two main tributaries of the
Rio Negro (see map), and has asked the Bank to assist in financing part
of the foreign exchange cost. The development is called the El Chocon -
Cerros Colorados Complex (CCC) of' which the El Chocon Project would be
built first. The complex would take nine years to complete and is estimated
to cost about US$544 million equivalent, including interest during construc-
tion. The El Chocon Project, with half of its ultimate generating capacity
installed, is estimated to cost about US$325 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of some US$145 million equivalent. The proposed
Bank loan of US$82 million would be applied only to the El Chocon Project
and would cover about 60% of its foreign cost.
1.02        The CCC complex is located about 1000 km southwest of Buenos
Aires in the Comahue region. The complex is divided into two separate but
complementary projects - the El Chocon Dam and Power Station on the Rio
Limay and the Cerros Colorados Project on the Rio Neuquen. The complex
has been designed to utilize the water of the Rio Negro system for electric
power production while at the same time reducing the magnitude of floods in
the valley. In later years, should the demand for irrigation water exceed
the normal flows, the complex will also provide some additional small agri-
cultural benefit. El Chocon will have an initial installation of 600 Mw
of generating capacity with provision for an ultimate capacity of 1200 Mw;
Cerros Colorados is planned to have 450 Mw of capacity. A high voltage
transmission system will transmit the power to the Buenos Aires market.
Power from El Chocon is expected to be available to meet the winter peak
load in 1973.
1.03        Present plans call for the complex to be constructed in two
stages. The first stage comprises (a) the 600 Mw El Chocon Project,
including the transmission system and (b) the Portezuelo Grande diversion
works which would be the first part of Cerros Colorados. The second stage
of the complex consists of the installation of a further 600 Mw of capacity
at El Chocon and the construction of a 450 Mw powerhouse on the Neuquen at
Planicie Banderita which would utilize the water diverted by the Portezuelo
Grande works. The Government of Argentina has not yet taken a final deci-
sion on the construction of the Planicie Banderita powerhouse. An alterna-
tive to Planicie Banderita, presently under consideration, is a gas-fired
thermal plant. The choice would be made by 1970 depending upon the quanti-
ties of natural gas which can be proven by the present exploration program
in the area.



- 2 -
1.0i     The ?1 Chocon 3roject has been under active investigation by
Argentina for more than a decade. Several geological, hydrological and
energy availability studies of the Rio Negro and its branches have been
made over the years, wqhich resulted in attention being focused on the El
Chocon site of the Rio Neuquen for combined power and flood control pur-
poses. A few years after Argentina joined the Bank, the United Nations
Special Fund, in 1959, sponsored a power study of Argentina for which the
Bank acted as the executing agency. One of the conclusions of this study
was that m5 Chocon could not be economically justified before about 1969,
unless a substantial part of its cost could be charged to irrigation and
flood control.   During the period since then, further studies were carried
out by a consulting group consisting of Italconsult of Italy and Sofrelec
of France in association with the U.S. firm of Harza, wqhich resulted in 1965
in the presentation of a design for El Chocon essentially the same as now
being carried out, but in addition enlarged the scope of the earlier plans
by including the Cerros Colorados project on the Neuquen.
1.05      Hidroelectrica Norpatagonica (Hidronor) wjas created in 1967 for
the primary purpose of constructing and operating the CCC complex. The
final design and supervision of construction of the complex has been en-
trusted to the British consulting ftrm,Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners.
Constructicn of the El Chocon Project has commenced.
1.06      In addition to the proposed Bank loan, foreign exchange required
to coimllete the financing of the complex is expected to be forthcoming in
the form of buyer credits from Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Spain , SwTeden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United
States.  The proceeds of these credits would be applied to contracts for
the electrical and mechanical equipment of the El Chocon powerhouse and
the transmission system. Tendering for these contracts would be on a
multilateral basis among suppliers from the countries listed above; the
tender documents and tender analyses would be submitted to the Bank for
review.
1.07      The Bank has made two loans in the Argentine power sector, both
to Servicos Electricos del Gran Buenos Aires S.A. (SEGBA). The first loan
(308 AR) for US$95 million was made in January 1962 to complete a 600 Mtw
thermal generating plant plus transmission and distribution. The second
loan (525-AR) for US,o55 million was made in January 1968 to help finance
SEGBA's continuing generation, transmission and distribution program.
1.08      This appraisal report is based in part upon Bank reviewTs of the
various engineering and economic studies made by Argentine Government
agencies and their consulting engineers, an independent cost estimate of
the complex made for the Bank by Jacobs Associates of California, and an
economic analysis performed by Dr. Henry D. Jacoby of the Harvard University
WpJater Program. Additional information was obtained by a mission which
visited Argentina in August 1968 consisting of: Messrs. R. H. Sheehan and
F. Rydell of the Bank, and Mr. G. P. de Brichambaut, Mr. K. E. Snelson, and
Miss A. 14. Eid of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program.



2. BACKGROUND
2.01      Argentina has an area of 2.8 million ki2, a population of about
23.5 million, and a gross domestic product (GDP) of about US$16 billion
equivalent. GDP on a per capita basis was estimated by the Bank in 1967
at US$760. Industry represents the largest sector of the economy contri-
buting about 30% of the GDP, but little industrial production is sold abroad
because high import protection has led to high costs. The next largest sector
of the economy, about half the size of industry, is agriculture. The prin-
cipal exports are meat, grains, and vegetable oils. The domestic market ab-
sorbs most of the wine, fruit, vegetables, sugar, cotton and tobacco which are
produced. Over the past fifteen years the per capita GDP has been growing at
a real rate of only about 1%; during the same period, the production of power
increased at an average rate of only 6%, although in the last few years the
demand has been growing somewhat faster. The relatively slow rate of growth of
electricity production is in part a reflection of the performance of the
Argentine economy. Conversely,the power shortages which existed from the
early 1950's to the early 1960's and which compelled industry to resort to
the installation of its own plants for the generation of electricity, undoubt-
edly had some bearing on the slow economic growth. For the next decade the
annual rate of increase of electric power production is expected to average
about 7% on the assumption there will be a somewhat more rapid overall economic
growth than in the past (see Economic Report WH 182a, July 16, 1968).
2.02      The electric power sector in Argentina at the present time has a
total installed generating capacity of some 5,720 Mw, including 1,670 Mw of
"captive" industrial plant; the total generation in 1967 was about 16,700 Gwh,
of which more than 90% was by thermal plants. The principal entities in the
electric power sector in Argentina are: the federal water and power authority -
Agua y Energia Electrica (AyEE); Servicios Electricos del Gran Buenos Aires
(SEGBA), a government-owned corporation; Compania Italo-Argentina de Alectricidad
S. A. (Italo), a privately owned corporation controlled by Swiss interests;
Empresa Provincial de &iergia de Cordoba (EPEC), a provincial government enter-
prise, and Direccion de la Energia - Buenos Aires (DEBA), a provincial government
department. These organizations account for about 95% of the total electric
power investment in Argentina w-hich is available for public supply. The book
value of the assets in the public sector is shown at about M$N350 billion.
However, since much of the investment has been made over the past ten years, a
period of rapid inflation, it is difficult to estimate the value in dollars.
As a rough approximation, the total public sector power assets may be considered
to have an order of magnitude value of, say, US$2 billion. Over the next five
years the annual investment in the electric power sector, including the El Chocon
Project, is expected to average about US$280 million equivalent, or somewhat
less than 2% of present GDP.
2.03      The Gran Buenos Aires-Litoral system, which is by far the most im-
portant in the country because of the large concentration of population and
industry in and around Buenos Aires, will receive the power from El Chocon.
The system is now supplied by the three largest entities in the power sector
with the following amounts of installed capacity, all of which is thermal:
AyEE             502 Mw
SEGBA          1,573 Mw
Italo            367 Mw
2d,72 Mw



The total number of customers connected to the system exceeds 2.3 million.
Since January 1, 1968, all of the generating plants in the system are con-
trolled by a central dispatch office. In the federal capital and in four
of the surrounding municipalities, there is some overlapping and duplica-
tion of distribution facilities by SEGBA and Italo, but the two companies
are now coordinating all phases of planning and operation in order to im-
prove the situation. Eventually, a consolidation or merger of the two com-
panies may be effected, but in the meantime the present arrangements are
acceptable (for further details see Report No. TO-606a on the appraisal
of SEGBA's expansion program).
3. EXPANSION PROGRAM FOR THE BUENOS AIRES-LITORAL SYSTEM
3.01          Present plans for additional generating capacity for the
Buenos Aires-Litoral system are intended to meet the increase in load growth
until the first power from El Chocon becomes available in June 1973. Annex
1 shows the sytem demand projection and the planned capacity for the next
ten years.  A diagram of the load and capacity is shown in Annex 2.  The
load is estimated to increase by 9% in 1969 and at 7% annually thereafter.
The first new generating unit to be completed will be Italo's 250 Mw base
load steam plant in 1969.  It will be followed by an almost identical unit
of SEGBA in 1970.  For the peak of 1971, Italo plans to have two new 17.5
Mw gas turbines in operation.  By 1972 the Argentine Atomic Energy Commis-
sion hopes to have the first nuclear power plant in Latin America suffi-
ciently completed sothat it can help meet the Buenos Aires requirements.
This unit is a 313 Mw heavy water moderated,natural uranium plant which was
ordered from Siemens of Germany in January 1968. For all practical purposes
this will be prototype installation and it is doubtful whether the design,
fabrication, and erection can proceed rapidly enough to have the unit in
even partial commercial operation by 1972. If the load grows as now pro-
jected, and should the nuclear unit in fact fall behind schedule, the
Argentine Government will either have to install additional gas turbines
or elect to ration over the peak until El Chocon is ready.
3.02          In addition to new generating plant for greater Buenos Aires,
both SEGBA and Italo are engaged in an extensive program of new underground
transmission lines, new substations and extensions of existing substations,
and distribution expansion and rehabilitation. The cost of the combined
program is estimated to average about US$90 million equivalent per year.
About half of this cost is coming from the internal cash generation of the
two entities. Most of the balance is being financed by suppliers credits
and the Bank's Loan 525-AR of US$55 million made to SEGBA in January 1968.
The Inter-American Development Bank is now considering a loan of US$15
million to Italo which is expected to be made before the end of this year;
the IBRD has been asked to consider another loan to SEGBA next year for the
continuing transmission and distribution program.
3.03          The first two 200 Mw units at El Chocon are scheduled for
commercial operation in time for the winter peak of 1973. The third unit
would be completed by January 1974. By that time the Buenos Aires system



- 5 -
load is expected to be growing at a rate of over 200 Mw per year, so the
remaining units at El Chocon (and the Planicie Banderita units, if a posi-
tive decision is taken) will have to be installed at a pace of about one
unit every nine months. The entire CCC complex would be completed by June
1978.
3.04        The complex when fully constructed will be essentially a peak
load development. During critical, low flow periods the generating units
will operate only a few hours a day over the system peak. On the other
hand, during times of high flow the units will be able to operate almost
continuously. This condition of practically constant operation will also
exist during the early years of operation at El Chocon when the first three
units by themselves will be able to utilize all the available energy of the
Rio Limay. By 1974 the average amount of energy available from El Chocon
will represent only about 20% of the Buenos Aires system requirement, hence
every kwh would be useable.
3.05        An informal agreement has been reached between SEGBA and Hidronor
for the use of El Choconts power. It is no doubt too soon to require a
detailed contract spelling out the exact charges and method of payment,
especially since both companies are Government owned and any arrangement
will be subject to the approval of the Secretariat of Power and Mines.
During negotiations assurances were received that SEGBA and Hidronor,
through an exchange of letters, would make arrangements so that none of the
El Chocon energy would be wasted, that Hidronor would receive payments from
SEGBA sufficient to cover its cost of production, and that a contract would
be signed by January 1, 1973. A condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan is the satisfactory completion of these arrangements.
3.06        Hidronor has agreed not to undertake any expansion project, not
included in the CCC complex, which might jeopardize the carrying out of the
complex before CCC is completed. Further, both Hidronor and the Government
have agreed to coordinate the expansion of power facilities for the Buenos
Aires area to prevent waste of energy, duplication of facilities, and
unnecessary investment.
4. THE EL CHOCON - CERROS COLORADOS COMPLEX
4.01        El Chocon is the type of hydro project in which the construction
of the dam will create both the head necessary to generate power and the
storage needed for regulation. Cerros Colorados, on the other hand, is a
unique "off-stream" development where storage is achieved by diverting river
flow into two deep and extensive natural depressions. Annex 3 describes
the physical characteristics of the Comahue region and the proposed operation
of the reservoirs.   The principal components of the complex are the following:
(a) Preliminary works
(b) The El Chocon dam and powerhouse
(c) A 500 kv transmission system
(d) The Portezuelo Grande diversion works
(e) The Planicie Banderita intake and powerhouse



- 6 -
Work on the first four of these items is included in Hidronor's initial
stage of construction. The Planicie Banderita powerhouse is part of the
second stage. The Bank Project is limited to the first three items; the
coverage of the proposed Bank loan would be further restricted to only
specific contracts as detailed in paragraph 4.17.
Stage I
4.02       The preliminary works include all the facilities necessary for a
construction camp which will later be used as an operators' village. Included
are various types of housing and a civic center with church, schools, stores,
social and sports facilities, etc. The village will also have complete water
supply, sewage, and electricity systems.
4.03       The El Chocon dam will be located on the Rio Limay about 80 km
upstream of the confluence with the Rio Neuquen. An access road four km long
connects the dam site to the main highway No. 237 which runs between Neuquen
and Bariloche. This highway will have to be relocated before the reservoir
begins to fill. The dam is an earthfill structure with a maximum height of
about 90 m above the river bed and a crest length of about 2,300 m. A con-
crete spillway will be located on the right bank; the intake and powerhouse
will be on the left bank. The dam will have a total vSlume of about 15 mil-
lion m3 of fill. The reservoir will provide 20,170 hm of storage at maximum
water level with a surface area of 825 km2 and will extend some 70 km upstream
from the dam.
4.04       The El Chocon powerhouse when completed will contain six 200 Mw
generators driven by Francis type turbines. The present Project includes only
the first three units, although manufacturers are being asked to quote for an
optional fourth unit which may be purchased within one year of the signing of
the contract.
4.05       The transmission system will consist of two single-circuit, three-
phase overhead 500 kv lines about 1,080 km long. The towers will be steel,
either self-supporting or guyed. Each phase will have a bundle of four ACSR
conductors and each line will have two galvanized steel earth conductors. In
addition to a switchyard at El Chocon, there will be two intermediate switch-
ing stations located at about one-third and two-thirds of the distance to
Buenos Aires. These stations, at Puelches and Henderson, are primarily for
system reliability in the event of a fault on one of the lines, but they will
also be able to provide local supplies of power through the use of saturable
reactors. The terminal arrangements at Buenos Aires are not yet made. Hi-
dronor's consultants and SEGBA's consultants, Sofrelec, are jointly studying
whether only one step-down substation, or two, would be required. A decision
on this matter is expected by January 1969.
4.o6       The Portezuelo Grande diversion works consist of a low earth em-
bankment from four to seven m high and about three km long across the Rio
Neuquen some 130 km upstream of the confluence with the Rio Limay. The embank-
ment will have a concrete spillway section capablQ of passing 3,600 m3/sec. An
inlet structure capable of handling about 8,00o m /sec will be located about
one km upstream of the embankment. The inlet structure will conduct the water
from the Rio Neuquen into the two natural basins of Los Barreales and Mari
Menuco. The basins have a combines storage capacity of 43,400 hm at maximum
water level and a total surface area of 620 km2.



- 7-
Stage II
4.07      The second stage of the complex involves the installation of the
last three units at El Chocon and either the construction of the Planicie
Banderita powerhouse or an alternative gas-fired thermal plant. Work on
the second stage would not start until 1972.
4.08      The Planicie Banderita intake and powerhouse have not yet been
finally designed. If constructed, the project will utilize the water diverted
at Portezuelo Grande and stored in the two natural basins. It will first be
necessary to build two short closure dikes on the rim of the Los Barreales
basin and a long closure dike along the southeast edge of the Mari Menuco basin.
The power house would be located on the Rio Neuquen about 60 km doiTnstream of
Portezuelo Grande.  A two km approach channel from the Yari Menuco basin will
conduct the water to a forebay from which penstocks will lead to the powerhouse.
After passing through the turbines the water would return to the Rio Neuquen.
Three generating units of 150 Mw would be installed similar to those of El
Chocon.

4.11      The civil works portion of the estimate is based on contract prices
for the preliminary works and the prices which were quoted for the main civil
contract in September. The electrical and mechanical equipment costs and the
transmission system costs are based upon current international prices. The
contingency amounts vary from 10 to 20% for the different categories and are
considered adequate. Customs duties are not included since the complex has
been exempted by law. The estimated cost of the Project is realistic.
4.12      For the initial installation of 600 Mwif at El Chocon,including the
full transmission cost, the unit cost of generating capacity is about 541 $/kw
including interest. When completed the complex wsould have a unit cost of 330
4/kw.  As indicated in the economic evaluation (paragraph 5.08), when compared
to alternative thermal capacity at 130 $/kw, the savings in system operating
costs over the life of the development are equivalent to a minimum return of
about 7V,, on the additional capital investment.
Engineering and Construction
4.13      The consulting engineering contract between Sir Alexander Gibb and
Partners and the Argentine Government uas signed on September 23, 1967. The
contract has since been assigned to Hidronor. It provides for Gibb to receive
both fixed fees and separate reimburseable expenses for technical direction,
inspection, commissioning, special stud-es, out of pocket expenses, etc. Under
the contract, Gibb has delegated the engineering responsibilities for the
generating plant and the transmission system to the British firm of Merz and
McLellan. Gibb has also retained Argentine architect-engineers for special
assistance, particularly with the preliminary works. The arrangements for
consulting engineering are satisfactory. The loan agreement provides
for the continuing employment of acceptable consultants.
4.14      The El Chocon dam is expected to be constructed in steps during the
years 1969 through 1973.  In the first phase of construction, up to September
1970, cofferdams will be built on both banks of the river and the flow will
pass through the left part of the natural river bed. Two ten-meter diameter
diversion tunnels will be excavated on the left bank while the embankment
section is being placed on the right bank. The tunnels will later serve as
penstocks for two of the generating units. In the second step, from October
1970 to July 1971, the river flow will be diverted through the tunnels while
the dam is constructed completely across the river and raised to an elevation
high enough to permit the handling of the critical flood of record. Work
will then continue simultaneously on the dam, powerhouse and spillway. Im-
pounding is scheduled for the period May through December 1972 so that testing
of the first turbine may be started in January 1973. The dam is expected to
be completed and the first two generating units in commercial operation by
June 1, 1973.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.15      Following bidding among Argentine firms, Hidronor issued a letter
of intent on August 22, 1968 to Jose Castellone Construcciones Civiles S.A.,
for the preliminary works, including the construction camp, access roads,



- 10 -
water and sewage system, etc. After prequalification of prospective bidders
on an international basis, tenders for the El Chocon main civil works contract
were issued in April 1968 to eight consortia, with the Bank's approval. The
tenders were opened in September and analyzed by Gibb. On October 23, 1968
the Bank agreed to the issuance of a letter of intent to the successful group
of Impregilo of Italy and Sollazzo Hermanos of Argentina.
4.16      The penstocks, gates, and atructural steel related to the El Chocon
civil works will be purchased after international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. This equipment will be
procured during 1969 through sub-contracts to the main civil contract.
Argentine suppliers will be granted a 15% margin of preference.  To avoid dis-
crimination against local industry, the proposed Bank loan would cover the
cost of these items irrespective of whether a local or foreign supplier submits
the lowest evaluated tender.
4.17      Tendering for the mechanical and electrical equipment for the El
Chocon powerhouse and the transmission system would be on a multilateral basis
restricted to suppliers from the countries providing the buyer credits (see
paragraph 7.16 for the status of the credits). The tendering procedure in all
other respects would follow the Bank's Guidelines. Bids for the turbo-genera-
tors and cranes were opened on November 27, 1968, and transmissicn bids will
be opened January 27, 1969. The remaining equipment tenders would be called
for during 1969. Although the final decision has not yet been taken, the
Argentine Government apparently will restrict the tendering on the Portezuelo
Grande works (which are not included in the Bank Project) to local firms.
Construction of Portezuelo Grande is tentatively scheduled to begin at the end
of 1969 and to be completed by 1972.
4.18      The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be applied only to: the
estimated foreign currency component of the main civil works contract (US$37.6
million); the full cost of the subcontracts for gates, penstocks, and struc-
tural steel (US$2;.4 million); the foreign component of the consulting en-
gineers' charges (US$6.3 million); and inteiest during construction on the
Bank loan (US$16.7 million).  Disbursements for the civil works would be .on
a percentage basis against monthly statements of work performed under unit
price contracts as certified by the consulting engineers. In order to expedite
construction Hidronor has agreed, if requested by the main civil contractor, to
make direct payments for his purchases of imported construction equipment. The
amounts of any such payments would be deducted on a pro rata basis from the
civil works certificates. Payments to the consulting engineers would be against
both the fixed schedule of fee charges and monthly or quarterly bills for re-
imburseable expenses. It is recommended that the Bank reimburse expenditures
on the main civil works contract from October 23, 1968, the date of the letter
of intent issued to the contractor. These are not expected to exceed US$0.3
million.

5. JUSTIFICATION OF THE CO&TLEX
Previous Studies
5.01      A Bank mi-sion in April 1966 concluded that flood control and
irrigation benefits would be small and that CCC would have to be justified
as a power project. Another Bank mission in October 1966 assisted an
Argentine "Working Group" in reviewing the power aspects of the complex.
The two 1966 missions confirmed that the economic justification of CCC
depended almost entirely on its initial cost.  Because thlere was no precedent
in Argentina for a project of this magnitude, the Bank in early 1967 engaged
Jacobs Associates of California, construction cost specialists, to prepare
an independent estimate of the cost of the civil works only. (The Government
paid the local currency costs of the Jacobs' study). Jacobs' estimate was
about 45% higher than the  Italconsult-Sofrelec-Harza 1964 estimate.
5.02      In September 1967 a thorough review of the complex was made using
a range of construction costs, various fuel prices, and assumptions for the
value of non-power benefits.  The Bank concluded the cost of QCC and the
thermal alternative appeared to be equal for discount rates between 5-3/h%o
and 7% (i.e. at higher rates the thermal alternative would be the better
choice). This was confirmed by a study carried out for the Bank by Dr. Henry
D. Jacoby of the Harvard University W.1ater Program. using a special computer
program he had developed in connection with earlier studies of the Greater
Buenoc Aires-Litoral system. The Argentine authorities felt that these results
were unduly pessimistic because the Jacobs cost estimate was too high, and
the non-power benefits assumed were too low.
5.03      By the middle of 1967 tuhe Government had decided to construct the
complex, and expressed the wish that the Bank associate itself with the
financing of El Chocon.  An October 23, 1C67  decree authorized the form-
ation of a stocL corporation (Hidronor) to build the complex (see paragraph
6.01).  Prior to the formation of Hidronor, the Secretariat of Power and
Mines had engaged Gibb as consulting engineers and as their first assign-
ment asked the.m to review the economics of the complex.
The Gibb Economic Fvaluation
5.0h      Gibb prepared a report in Niovember 1967 and a supplement in
February 1968 baeed on their own estimates of the cost of the complex and
of the benefits accruing from power generation, flood control and irriga-
tion. They increased the size of the El Chocon generators from 150 Mtw to
200 Miw, reducing the civil works costs by about $19 million.  (Gibb also
investigated - and eliminated as less economic - several other variations
in the design of the complex). They confirmed that flood control and irri-
gation benefits would be relatively small. Gibb reached two other signifi-
cant conclusions: first, the complex as nowf planned would be more attractive
than the thermal alternative for costs of capital less than 9.3%; second,
if Cerros Colorados were eliminated entirely, and the capacity of El Chocon
increased from 1200 Mw to 1650 ,, the return on invested capital would be
as great. Although without Cerros Colorados flood control benefits and
electric energy production would be less, the savings in capital cost would
be about $91 'million.

The Bank/Jacoby Evaluatioo
5.05      After reviewing the Gibb studies the Bank explored various alter-
natives to the complex, and again engaged Dr. Jacoby to help establish the
most economic solution. This latest analysis used digital computer simula-
tions of alternatives designed to serve equally well the needs of the Greater
Buenos Aires-Litoral market. The Bank study, vis-a-vis the Gibb studies, em-
ployed a higher capital cost for the complex, lower costs for conventional
new thermal plant, and lower operation and maintenance cost for all thermal
plant. (Annex 10 shows the cost data used in these studies).The CCC complex
turned out to be less costly than the thermal alternative for a capital cost
less than 7%.  Putting the entire 1650 Aw on the Limay and nothing on the
Neuquen would be less costly still, oy a small margin,
The Non-Power Benefits
5.06      Annex 5 is the report of the FAO group which was part of the
August 1968 Bank mission. This report concludes, for purposes of cost allo-
cation, that CCC will prevent flood damages with a present value, discounted
at 8%, of $20 million; and that the irrigation benefits would have a present
value, also discounted at 8%, of $2 million. Practically equal flood pro-
tection could be obtained by enlarging the capacity of the Lago Pellegrini
diversion instead of building the diversion works at Portezuelo Grande, at a
saving of the order of $20 million. With an enlarged canal to Lago Pellegrini,
Cerros Colorados could then be eliminated without sacrificing flood protection.
This finding further enhances the attractiveness of the scheme in which the
full 1650 Hw would be installed at El Chocon.
Justification
5.07      The Gibb studies, as well as the studies done by the Bank and Jacoby,
indicate that the alternative involving the least initial capital expenditure
would be to abandon Cerros Colorados and install 1650 r at Chocon. This al-
ternative was urged upon the Government by Bank staff, but without success.
The Government insists that a control structure be built on the Neuquen
at- Portezuelo Grande. They argued that because there is little difference
between the long-range economic costs of these two alternatives, they wished
to proceed with the first stage of the complex as planned, leaving open the
option of installing power facilities on the Neuquen at a later date. The
Bank's position was that since there is little difference on economic grounds,
the least capital intensive alternative should be built.
5.08      As stated in paragraph 4.15, the award of the main civil contract for
El Chocon has recently been decided. On the basis of the contract price, the
cost of the complex is now estimated to be about $33 million less than that
used in the above economic evaluations. The effect is to make the complex
more attractive than an alternative thermal development for costs of capital
less than 10% (Gibb study) or 7V,, (Bank/Jacoby study). These would appear to
be practical upper and lowier limits for the 6qualizing-discountj 'iteand estab-
lish an acceptable range. In the meanwhile exploration for petroleum in the
immediate vicinity is proceeding rapidly, and should sufficient natural gas be
found it may prove advantageous to build a 450 N!w thermal plant instead of
Planicie Banderita.

6. TEE BORROWER
6.01       The President of Argentina, under Act No. 17,318, dated June 19,
1967, authorized the formation of stock corporations whereby at least 51%
of the total corporate capital may be owned by the Central Government, states
and municipalities. The primary objective of this Act is to permit the
Government to participate in various activities which could be organized and
administered in a manner traditionally limited to the private sector. Sub-
sequently Decree No. 7925/67 became effective on October 23, 1967 whereby
the Direccion Nacional de Energia y Combustibles (DNEC) and AyEE were author-
ized to establish Hidronor as a stock corporation for the purpose of carry-
ing out CCC. Hidronor's statute (Estatuto) was formally enacted on
December 13, 1967.
Management
6.02       The statute provides that Ridronor shall be under the general
direction and administration of a Board of Directors, consisting of not less
than four members nor more than six members. The directors are appointed
for a term of three years and may be reelected indefinitely. The Board selects
a president and a vice president from its own members.
6.03       The responsibility for every day planning and direction of Hidronorts
operations is delegated to an Executive Committee. This committee is formed
under the chairmanship of the president or vice president of the Board of
Directors and two other members, one of whom must be a member of the Board
and the other must be one of Hidronor's department managers. A committee
member's term of office is one year.  All appointments to the Executive Com-
mittee must be ratified-by the Board of Directors. The president of the
Executive Committee has the authority to appoint Hidronor's general manager
and all other managers, subject also to ratification by the Board.
6.04       At the present time General Manuel J. Olascoaga is the president
of the Board. General Olascoaga, retired from military service since 1962,
is a Doctor of Meteorology, and has been a member of the Board of Directors
of sev4ral government agencies, including AyEE and the National Bureau of
State Industries. Mr. Raul Agustin Ondarts is the vice president of the Board
and the president of the Executive Committee. Mr. Ondarts is a professor of
mathematics and civil engineer. Prior to 1957 he was active in private in-
dustry and teaching. Since 1957 he has been in government service, holding
several titles, including Under-Secretary of Industry of the National Govern-
ment, Secretary of StAte of Communications, and Under-Secretary of Economy
and Labor. Mr. Ondarts is well qualified for the position of president of
the Executive Committee. The Bank expects to be notified in advance of any
proposed new appointment to this position. There are four other members of
the Board, all of whom are well experienced in their respective fields of law,
engineering, finance and administration, in both the private and public sectors.



- 14 -
Present Status of Organization
6.05       At the time of the appraisal mission, Hidronor had six members of
the Board of Directors plus thirty employees. It expects to hire ten more
engineers within a few months and eight additional employees for a project
office near the site of El Chocon. It is estimated that the total staff for
the complex when in full operation will be about 350.
6.o6       As a new corporate entity, Hidronor is in the process of organi-
zing its staff and establishing standard forms and procedures. It has set up
a preliminary accounting system which has been adequate during this organiza-
tional period, but it will be necessary to install a complete public utility
accounting system based on a modern classification of accounts. Hidronor re-
cognized this problem and recently contracted with International Middle West
Service Company, a U.S. firm of management and engineering consultants, to
undertake this project. It has been agreed that this firm will establish an
accounting system which will be patterned as much as possible after the Uni-
form System of Accounts, as prescribed by the Federal Power Commission for
public utilities in the U.S., and still comply with Argentina requirements.
6.07       Hidronor recently engaged Henry Martin & Company, the Argentine
branch of a repubable firm of public accountants, as its independent auditors.
These arrangements are satisfactory. During negotiations Hidronor agreed to
continue employing auditors satisfactory to the Bank, and to submit to the
Bank nimrual certified financial statements accompanied by the auditor's report
not later than four months after the close of Hidronor's fiscal year.
Concession
6.o8       On December 21, 1967, Hidronor was authorized by Act No. 17,574
to build and operate the CCC complex. The concession contract is still in
draft form and has not yet been signed. The present draft concession is
satisfactory to the Bank; its signing by Hidronor and the Government is a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
6.og       The El Chocon - Cerros Colorados Fund was established under the
administration of the Secretariat of Power and Mines. This fund is the main
source of Hidronor's local finance to carry out CCC. Revenue for this fund
is to be derived from the following sources:
(a) funds already collected from a 3% surcharge on the sales price
of crude oil, which will later be increased to 5%;
(b) a 5% surcharge on the sales price of electricity;
(c)  annual appropriations from the National Power Fund and Electric
Power Fund;
(d) funds from the Executive Branch of the Central Government to cover
the works associated with irrigation and flood control; and
(e) other tax funds to be established.



- 15 -
6.10       The concession provides that Hidronor shall earn an annual 8%
return on the sum of a) its revalued gross fixed assets in operation at the
beginning of the year and the value of assets added to or withdrawn from
service during the year, in proportion to the period for which the assets
are added to or withdrawn from service, and b), 4% of a) for working capital
requirements. Hidronor is required to maintain its record of fixed assets in
operation in US dollars. Each year construction expenditures will be con-
verted into US dollars at the average free exchange rate during each year.
Such amounts will then be reconverted into pesos at the free exchange rate
prevailing at the end of each year for purposes of determining the valuation
of the rate base. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that Hidronor
would apply for, and the Government would grant, the level of tariffs to which
Hidronor is entitled under the concession.
6.11       The costs of the non-power assets (which are not revenue producing)
are to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Hidronor is permitted
by the concession to include the amortization as an operating cost and to
obtain the necessary income for the annual amortization charge through its
electricity tariff.
6.12       To promote economic development in the Comahue Region, the con-
cession requires Hidronor to provide power to public utilities in this area
at rates which would cover only operating costs, including depreciation and
amortization charges on the non-power assets. The Secretariat of Power and
Mines will fix the amount of such power to be provided and establish the
duration of the incentive rates.  Arrangemenvs for supplying power to the
Comahue utilities will not be made for several years, but it is expected that
only a very small portion of Hidronor's power will be sold in this region.
If Hidronor fails to achieve an overall return of 8% from its total operations
as a result of theee incentive rates, then the Government will compensate
Hidronor to the extent of the difference between the revenue derived from the
incehtive rates and the revenue that would have been derived from normal rates.
6.13       The concession further provides that in the event of a shortfall
in Hidronor's earnings the deficiency would be offset against profits in
excess of the permitted return accumulated in prior years. If such accu-
mulated profits are insufficient to cover the shortfall it may be remedied
by one or more of the following:
(a) an increase in Hidronor's electricity tariffs;
(b) a reduction or deferment in the amortization payments of
ordinary shares - Class "C" (described in paragraph 7.07);
(c) Reinvestment by the Government of amounts representing previous
amortization payments on Class "C" shares.
6.i4       Hidronor, and the Government as Guarantor, agreed not to change,
modify, terminate, or fail to enforce the provisions of Hidronor's statute
or concession without prior approval by the Bank.

7.02      Ordinary shares amounting to TUN4,OO0 million at December 31,
1967, represented stock subscriptions as follows:
M$N million
DNEC                            2,950
AyEE                            1,000
SEGBA                              50
Total       4,000
prior to the formation of Hidronor, CCC was under the administration of AyEE,
and this governmental agency met all the related preliminary expenditures
amounting to M$N900 million (present value). Hidronor intends to issue
shares with a par value of p$N900 million to AyEE and at the same time record
on its books a similar amount as work in progress CCC Stage I.
7.03      Hidronor expects DNEC to subscribe and pay for additional shares
amounting to M$N2,550 million during the second half of 1968 with funds obtained
from the surcharges on crude oil. Total shares outstanding as shown in the
above December 31, 1968, balance sheet would be M$N6,550 million.
7.o4      The work in progress should total about I$Nl,589 million by the end
of 1968. This amount is composed of estimated expenditures as follows: Stage I-
El Chocon Project, M$N1,260 million; Portezuelo Grande, M$Nlhl million; and
administrative assets, Yl,iN188 million.
Share Capital
7.05      Under the terms of its statute, Hidronor is authorized to issue up
to M$N20,000 million in the form of two million shares each with a par value
of i1L,NlO,0C0. The shares may be increased up to five times this original
authorization by decision of the general meeting of shareholders.
7.06      The only types of shares that may be issued are Class A, Class B,
and preferred shares. Class A shares must be registered, may or may not be
transferable by endorsement, and carry one vote for each share. Class B shares
have the same conditions except they may be bearer or registered shares. Class
A shares, however, may only be issued to the Central Government, states or
municipalities as specified in Act Nqo. 17,318 of June 19, 1967, (see paragraph
6.01). Furthermore, the total Class A shares outstanding may never be less
than 51% of the total shares outstanding. Since SEGBA is not one of the parties
eligible to procure Class A shares, it acquired Class B shares. Preferred
shares may be either cumulative or non-cumulative, participating or non-
participating, and may carry the usual preferential clauses associated with
preferred shares. The general meeting of the shareholders will determine the
terms of preferred shares. At the present time, however, Hidronor does not
foresee the issuance of preferred shares.



- 18 -
7.07      Hidronor must issue either non-interest bearing bonds or other
certificates of indebtedness, or capital shares not entitled to dividends,
for funds allocated to irrigation and flood control works. During the
appraisal mission and again during negotiations, Hidronor indicated that
it intends to issue capital shares not entitled to dividends for these
works. These shares will be a form of Class A shares except for the divi-
dend provision. For purposes of the financial forecast such shares have
been identified as Class 'C"0 shares.
Financing Plan
7.08      The present construction schedule for the completion of the CCC
shows a ten-year period, 1969 through 1978. CCC consists of two stages of
development as described in Chapter 4. The estimated construction schedule
for Stage I includes the five-year period 1969 through 1973 but funds will
still be expended in 1974 covering accrued expenditures, retention fees, and
final settlement costs. Stage II covers the seven-year period 1972 through
1978. Therefore, there is an overlapping period of three years, 1972 through
1974, when cash will be expended for both stages of development.
7.09      Annex 7, Forecast Source and Application of Funds Statements, shows
the flow of funds for the ten-year period, 1969 through 1978. It summarizes
the flow of funds during 1969 through 1974, the six-year period when cash
payments will be made for Stage I and for the first three years of construction
of Stage II. Also shown is a summary of the years 1975 through 1978, during
which only Stage II will be under construction.
7.10      The table on the next page shows the financial plan for the six
years 1969 through 1974.
7.11      Under Hidronor's present forecast it is estimated that working
capital will increase by about M$N18,500 million.  Although this material
increase in working capital appears excessive, it should be pointed out
that Hidronor's forecast assumes that the funds from surcharges on oil and
electricity will cease in early 1975, and the large build-up in working
capital will be required to finance the Stage II development program.
7.12      Net internal generated cash is very small, providing only about
1% of the funds for the period 1969-1974, because El Chocon is not expected
to begin operations until mid-1973.
7.13      Hidronor expects to obtain the necessary funds to carry out Stage
I from the following main sources: the proposed IBRD loan, long-term buyer
credits, medium-term loans covering interest' during construction on the
buyer credits and equity investments by the Argentine Government.

For purposes of the financial projections in this report it has been assumed
that the proposed IBRD loan would be for 25 years including a grace period
of six years with interest at 6S:0.
7.16      Other proposed foreign loans, in the form of buyer credits, estimated
to total M$N19,145 million equivalent would cover the remanning foreign costs
consisting primarily of electrical and mechanical equipment and the trans-
mission system. Hidronor has received letters of intent from the U.S., the
U.K., Canada, Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, and Italy to

to finance purchases in their respective countries. In addition to these
nine countries, Spain has also expressed some interest in possible partici-
pation in this financing plan.
7.17      It has been agreed with the nine participating countries mentioned
in the preceding paragraph that the terms of financing must meet certain
minima criteria; namely, five-year grace period, 15-year amortization period
and a reasonable interest rate. A tentative schedule of the terms and con-
ditions of these possible buyer credits is presented in Annex 8. Since the
financing from each country will not be known until after contracts have been
awarded to the successful bidders, it has been assumed in the financial fore-
cast that the terms of the loans would be the above minima with a 6w  interest
rate. These foreign loans represent about 12% of the total funds expected
to be available during the years 1969 through 1974.
7.18      When Hidronor's representatives visited the interested foreign
countries seeking loans to finance the foreign equipment costs, they also
endeavored to obtain additional funds to finance the interest during con-
struction on these loans. In most of the countries they received favorable
indications that medium-term loans (five years) would be available to cover
such interest. In the financial projections it was assumed that the drawings
on these medium-term loans would correspond to the accrued interest on the
long-term loans, with amortization commencing one year after drawing and
interest at 7%. These medium-term loans would be about 1% of the total funds
assumed for the period 1969 through 1974.
7.19      In addition to the foreign borrowing required for El Chocon, Hidronor
has included in its financial plan for the six-year period 1969 through 197h,
proposed future foreign loans amounting to about US$37.7 million equivalent
to cover foreign costs of the Stage II development program. This amount re-
presents the estimated foreign costs to be incurred during the years, 1972
through 1974. Because of the phasing of the estimated Stage II construction
expenditures, it was assumed that two foreign loans would be needed in the
amounts of US$49.3 million equivalent and US$28.7 million equivalent of which
USz33.2 million equivalent and US$4.5 million equivalent respectively would
be required during the three years 1972 through 1974. These loans, identified
as proposed future foreign loans A and B in the financial projections, would
provide about 8% of the funds for the six-year period ending in 1974.  Terms
have been assumed to be a five-year grace period, 15-year amortization period
and interest at 6½%.
7.20      Estimated equity investments by the Argentine Government for the
six years 1969 through 197h, M$1493,170 million, would be sufficient to cover
all local costs for the period and to provide funds for local construction
expenditures after 1974. These government investments are represented by
Class A and Class "IC ordinary shares (see paragraphs 7.06, 7.07). Of this
amount, 14$N76,708 million represent Class A shares and the remainder M$N16,462
million Class 'IC" shares. Funds represented by Class 'IC" shares, will be
allocated to two projects. The total cost of Portezuelo Grande, M$N11,026
million, will be classified as irrigation and flood control works. The



- 22 -
remaining balance of MjM5,436 million will be allocated to El Chocon on
the basis that this represents the estimated proportionate cost of irrigation
and flood control works. The portion of the total cost being allocated to
the non-power functions of CCC is based on Hidronor's evaluation of the cor-
responding benefits. Although this amount is about double the mission's
estimate of the value of these benefits, it can be accepted because the dif-
ference is small in relation to the total cost of the complex.
7.21      It has been assumed that all the funds for the Governmentts invest-
ment in Hidronor would be obtained from surcharges on oil and electricity.
The Bank has received assurances that the Government would increase the sur-
charge on oil refining from 3% to 5% as of January 1, 1969, and that the 5%
surcharge on electricity consum.ption would come into effect on the same date.
It is expected that the surcharges would end on December 31, 197h. Because
of the importance of these funds to the financing plan, the implementation
of these taxes has been made a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan.
7.22      Hidronor's financing plan for Stage I depends on the a,ward of
equipment contracts being widespread enough to utilize a sufficient amount
of the funds available from the buyer credits. The amounts that can be used
will not be known for at least another year when all the contracts will have
been placed. If all the equipment contracts are not covered by the buyer
credits, the Government must provide the necessary additional funds. During
negotiations assurances were obtained that in the event of any shortage of
funds to complete the Bank Project, Hidronor would receive the required
amounts from the Governmaewt.
Forecast of Operating Results
7.23      Forecast income statements showing operating results for the second
half of 1973 and for the succeeding five years are shown in Annex 9. Sales
of energy, based on the installation schedule of the generators and assuming
average water flows each year, are estimated to increase from 3,100 million
kwh in 1974, the first full year of operations, to about 4,600 million kwh
in 1978. On the assumption that Hidronor achieves the permitted rate of
return the forecast income statements show that the average annual price per
kwh would very betwTeen M$N3.46 to M$N3.77 for the five and one half year
period, mid-1973 through 1978, with an overall average sales price of M$N3.61
per kwh.
7.2h      Depreciation, based on a sixty-year average useful life of the
assets, has been calculated in accordance with the sinking-fund method as
prescribed by Hidronor's concession. Sinking-fund depreciation, rather than
the customary straight-line method, is justified in the light of Hidronor's
objective, which is to construct and operate only the CCC complex. If
straight-line depreciation were employed, depreciation charges would be con-
siderably higher during the early years of operation compared to charges
under the sinking-fund method. However, with straight-line depreciation
the return would normally be related to net fixed assets in operation and



- 23 -
as the rate base would decrease each year because of annual increases in
the reserve for depreciation, there would be a gradual decline in tariffs.
Over the estimated life of the assets, tariffs would eventually become very
low and the operating income would finally be reduced to zero. In a case
where the amount of operating assets remains fixed after completion, such
as with Hidronor, the use of sinking-fund depreciation avoids this tariff
situation. Hidronor's rate of return is calculated on the gross fixed assets
in operation which remain unchanged throughout the life of the complex.
Therefore, gross revenues and tariffs should remain at about the same level
during the entire period of operations. During the early years tariffs would
be less than those resulting from the use of the straight-line method of de-
preciation, but in later years tariffs would be greater. The primary advantage
of sinking-fund depreciation is its leveling influence on tariffs.
7.25      The forecast income statements based on the above assumptions in-
dicate satisfactory operating results. Annual net income increases from about
Y$N7,000 million in 1974 to about 14"NlO,O0 million in 1978. Net income is
sufficient to cover allocations for the legal reserve, an annual 8% dividend
on ordinary shares - Class A and B, the Executive Committee's authorized share
of profits, and finally the interest element of the annual depreciation credited
to the reserve for depreciation. Interest coverage is quite adequate with an
average annual coverage of about 2.6 times.
7.26      Annual debt service coverage as shown in Annex 7 is satisfactory,
averaging about 1.6 times during the first five complete years of operations,
1974 through 1978. Thereafter debt service coverage should tend to increase
annually. Gross internal cash generation will be sufficient to meet debt
service, dividends, redemption of ordinary shares - Class 'IC" and the Executive
Committee's share of profits.
Future Financial Position
7.27      The future financial position of Hidronor is presented in the Balance
Sheets, Annex 6. The first facility completed, Portezuelo Grande costing about
N$I4l,000 million, is shown in the December 31, 1972, balance sheet under the
classification of non-power assets. This amount is increased at the end of
1973 by the addition of the non-power portion of El Chocon. Thereafter the
non-power assets will decrease each year by a write down in value equivalent
to the annual amortization of the ordinary shares - Class 'IC".
7.28      By the end of 1978, Hidronor's total fixed assets are estimated at
about N1q$N188,000 million. CCC is expected to be completed in 1978, as in-
dicated by the absence of work in progress at the December 31, 1978 balance
sheet. In future years the only change in the fixed assets account should
be the annual increase in the reserves for depreciation and the wmrite down
of the non-power assets as mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
7.29      At the end of 1974, Hidronor's forecast balance sheet shows an
exceptionally high amount of working capital (see paragraph 7.11). By the
end of 1978 after the program is completed the cash balance will be greatly
reduced and the current ratio should decline to about 1.5/1.



-24 -
7.30      During the ope*Ating period 1973 through 1978i there is a satis-
factory relationship between idiig*ter1  debt and equity with a tatio varying
only slightly between 36/6h and 34/66.
7.31      Unless Hidronor expands its activities in the future by under-
taking additional power, irrigation or flood control projects, the trend of
its financial position in the years after 1978 may be readily projected.
Because the rate base is fixed, gross operating revenue should remain at a
relatively even level. Operating expenses should remain constant. Annual
debt service will steadily decline after 1979. No additional shares are
expected to be issued so annual dividend payments will remain fixed, as well
as the annual amortization requirement of the ordinary shares - Class "C"I.
Therefore after 1978, with a relatively steady stream of gross revenues and
slightly declining financial obligations, there should be a gradual accu-
mulation of cash and a constant improvement in the current ratio and in
the debt/equity ratio. During negotiations Hidronor agreed that the expected
cash increase would be applied to: (1) increased dividends, (2) prepayment
of long-term debt with prior approval by the Bank, or (3) redemption of
Government shares to the extent that the debt/equity ratio does not exceed
67/33.
7.32      While it is not the present intention of Hidronor to undertake
any works except those included in CCC, there is nothing in its statute
or concession that prohibits an expansion of activities in the future.
Under the projections in this report, Hidronor is shown to maintain a
satisfactory financial condition, but it is possible that undertaking ad-
ditional projects could adversely affect this position, especially in respect
to financing such projects through excessive or unfavorable debt commitments.
Therefore, in order to maintain a satisfactory financial condition in the
future, assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that Hidronor
-would not incur additional debt, other than that envisaged in the present
projections, without prior Bank approval, unless the internal cash generation
in the preceding 12-month period is at least 1.5 times the maximum future
debt service requirement, including the debt service on the proposed loan.
Under the present financial forecast Hidronor could incur, without Bank
approval, additional debt of about iL2N20,000 million, assuming reasonable
terms of, say, 6% interest and a twenty-year repayment period.
7.33      In the event Hidronor undertakes additional works beyond the
scope of the CCC complex, it may not be appropriate to continue the use
of sinking-fund depreciation as described in paragraph 7.24. Under its
concession, however, Hidronor may adopt another method of calculating
depreciation, and the rate base would then be modified accordingly.
8. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The CCC complex has been adequately planned and the construction
arrangements are satisfactory. The cost estimates contain reasonable
contingency allowances and the construction schedule is realistic.



- 25 -
8.02      The benefits to be expected from flood control and irrigation are
relatively small. The several economic evaluations of the complex, made
by comparing the total cost of power production with alternative thermal
development, show an acceptable range for the equalizing discount rate.
8.03      Negotiations are well under way for buyer credits which would
complete the financing plan. IWJith the proviso that the Government would
supply all local currency and meet any shortfall in foreign funds, the
financing plan is satisfactory.

ARGENTINA
EL CHOCON-CERROS COLORADOS COMPLEX
Physic_al Data and _'309ospox-,ir 9peration
1.         The region of the El Chocon - Cerros Colorados complex
is accessible by road, rail, and air from the main Argentine urban
centers on the Atlantic seaboard, The General Roca railway system
which operates between Buenos Aires and Bahia Blanca has a line
running up the Rio Negro valley and through the CCC complex area.
The railroad would be capable of handling freight required for the
construction of the Project, although the contractors may prefer
to haul equipment and supplies by highway. The city of Neuquen
with a population of some 20,000 is the urban center of the CCC
region and is linked by national telephone, telegraph and radio
with the entire country. The Neuquen airport is on the regular
flight routes of the Argentine commercial airlines.
2.         The El Chocon - Cerros Colorados region has a semi-
arid climate. Above the confluence of the Rios Limay and Neuquen
the terrain is a plateau on which only scrub-type vegetation exists.
Below the confluence, in the Upper Rio Negro valley, intensive
irrigation farming is carried out. The median monthly temperatures
vary from a maximum of about 21.50C in January to a minimum of
5.50c in July. The temperature drops to OO or lower about 50
days per year.  In the upper reaches of the Rio Limay basin, in
the Andes, the average annual rainfall is more than 1,000 mm east
of the Andes, and in the project area, the average annual rainfall
is less than 200 mm. Winds are generally moderate on the plateau
and light in the valley averaging 13 km/hr and 7 km/hr respectively,
but gusts of up to 130 km/hr have been recorded.  The frequency
of wzinds, however, is rather high. Calm periods are relatively rare
on the plateau, occurring for less than 10%l of the time. In the
valley about one-third of the days are calm.
3.         At the confluence of the Rios Limay and Neuquen, the
Rio Negro has a water shed area of 56,183 km2.  All of the Rio
Limay flow comes from the upper basin in the Andes where its
branches and streams run through strings of lakes formed by the
moraines of former glaciers. These lakes have a definite
regulating effect on the flow. The Limay has a winter peak due
to the rainfall and snow melt associated with the Antartic polar
front. The highest floods usually occur in the period May through
August, with lower floods possible from September through December.



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of  pages
Minimum flows are recorded from January through April. The average annual
discharge of the Limay is about 760 m3/sec which is equivalent to a volume
of 24,000 m3. The maximum recorded flood of 5,120 m3/sec occurred on
June 2, 1945. The Rio Neuquen has a more torrential regime. Its average
annual flow is about 320 m/sec which is equivalent to a volume of
10,000 hm3. The greatest flood flows on the Neuauen occur usually
during the May through July period; major floods are unlikely from
December to the end of April. The maximum recorded flow of 5,339 m3/sec
also occurred on June 2, 1945.
4.         At the El Chocon dam site, the river valley has width of
about 800 m and is covered with about 6 m of sandy gravel alluvium. The
valley walls and the rock immediately under the river consist of moderate-
ly cemented red sandstone interbedded with clay shale. Underneath this
formation, weaker banded sandstones occur.  In general, the foundation
sandstones comprise a very tight formation, but some grouting will be
required. The strata at Portezuelo Grande are geologically similar to
those at El Chocon except that the sandstone has not undergone sufficient
consolidation to be indurated and has remained quite friable. The sand-
stone is found in alternate layers with lenses of clay.  Grouting will be
necessary to seal off the contact surfaces between the sandstone and clay.
5.         The reservoirs at El Chocon and Cerros Colorados will be
operated so as to maximize the benefits of power and flood control. Until
a decision is taken on the construction of the Planicie Banderita power-
house, the Cerros Colorados storage will be used only for flood control.
All Rio Neuquen flows above 3,600 m3/sec will be diverted into the Ios
Barreales and iHari Menuco basins. Because of the large storage volume
and the relatively high rate of evaporation (1.22 m/year, net of rain-
fall) it will not be necessary to construct an outlet until the powerhouse
is built. In comparison to the volume of storage in the reservoirs, the
sediment load of the two rivers is low. Siltation of the reservoirs will
not be a problem.
6.         The El Chocon reservoir is olanned to be operated so that the
maximum discharge downstream of the dam (combined power releases and spill-
age will not exceed 3,000 m3/sec. To achieve this goal, the operating rule
curve calls for the reservoir level to be at a low point of elevation 378
by May 1st of each year and to be maintained at close to this level as
possible until the 1st of August. During this critical flood period the
rate of total discharge through the turbines and over the spillway at any
given time will be adjusted, depending upon both the rate of inflow and
the actual reservoir elevation.  From August 1st to January 1st the
reservoir will be allowed to gradually reach the maximum normal storage level
of elevation 381.  From January onward the water level will be drawn down
to again reach elevation 378 by May 1st and thus be prepared for the next
flood season. Based on an average yearts operation El Chocon will generate
3,322 Gwh. In the one-in-ten dry year the generation would be only 2,240
Gwh; in the one-in-ten wet year it would increase to 4,280 Gwh.
7.         The operation of El Chocon reservoir for flood control and
power would be compatible vith irrigation. Although irrigation needs for
the next twenty years or so can be met from natural flows, if and when
stored water is required it would first be run through the turbines to
generate electricity. The critical months for irrigation are January,
February and March which fortunately coincide with the period when the
reservoir is normally being drawn down to provide for the next flood season.

EL CHOCON - CERROS COLORADOS COMPLEX
Appraisal of Agricultural and Flood Control Benefits
The CCC complex comprising control works on the Rivers Limay
and Neuquen, which unite to form the Rio Negro, was originally conceived
for flood control and irrigation development, power generation being
only subsidiary. V-hile the emphasis of the project has now changed and
the complex is designed primarily as a power project, it will have some
flood control and irrigation benefits. Since the natural flow of the
Rio Negro is not yet fully utilized the irrigation benefits of the project
will not be immediate. It is, therefore, necessary to project a rate of
irrigation development to determine when storage and regulation would be
needed without the CCC complex. Project benefits, for the purpose of
cost allocation in order to determine the rate base, should be the lower
of (i) the present worth of the cost of single purpose reservoir(s)
giving irrigation facilities comparable to the ones provided by the complex
and built only when this storage is needed, or (ii) the present worth of
the irrigation benefits. The project is expected to insure complete flood
control in the area, therefore, these benefits for allocation purposes will
be the lower of (i) the present value of the foreseeable flood damages, or
(ii) the cost of constructing single purpose flood control facilities
giving comparable protection.
1. The Present Agricultural Situation
The region crossed by the Rio Negro and its tributaries, on
the northern boundary of Patagonia, has an arid, temperate climate.
Crop production is only possible with irrigation and double cropping
is difficult because of cold winters and a frost-free season not exceeding
200 to 250 days; high winds are common making the use of iend-breaks
indispensable. The light alluvial soils of the valley belong to twio
main groups: "bardas," low quality and poorly drained; and "costa,"
lighter, more fertile and better drained along the river. In the
irrigated areas the water table is often close to the surface, ranging
from three meters to less than one meter in depth and in low-lying areas
this has created salinization problems. The flat unirrigated table
land on both sides of the Rio Negro and of its tributaries is covered
by shrubs only suitable for very extensive grazing (up to 100 hectares
per animal unit).



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 8 pages
Of the 90,000 ha irrigated, three-quarters are located in
the Upper Valley (lower Limay and Neuquen, upper Rio Negro) where most
of the comimandable lands have been developed and only limited expansion
can be expected. Development of this area followed the construction
of the railway at the end of the 19th Century and two-thirds are planted
with apples,  pears and grapes.  With improved drainage conditions and'
improved water control a limited expansion of fruit trees and grapes
areas and yields is still possible. Apples and pears are the most signi-
ficant crops (US$40 million exports in 1967), and have prompted a signi-
ficant development of processing industries which also process grapes
and some other industrial crops and fruits.
Development of the Middle Valley started later and is far
behind the Upper V7alley. Much of the area for which irrigation works
have been constructed is not yet cultivated; annual crops and alfalfa
cover about 80% of the area, and except for tomato paste, there are no
processing industries. High water tables, especially on the island of
Choele Choel, create acute drainage and salinity problems. Soil quality
and production potential are slightly lower than in the Upper Valley
and this potential will ti.ke some years to develop through building up
soil fertility with alfalfa and improving drainage.
Except for limited private pumping, the Lower Valley is not
yet irrigated although a main and secondary canal system has been
constructed to serve 50,000 ha.  IDEV1I   is beginning development this
year but the flat slopes, heterogeneous soils and a high saline water
table wqill call for efficient drainage and careful irrigation practices.
2.   Irrigation Possibilities and Benefits
(a) Prospects for Irrigation Expansion
The existing irrigated areas depend on the natural river flow.
Irrigation has expanded slowly. The area newly developed during the last
ten years was less than 1.5% annually, although water and land availabi-
lity were not limiting factors. On areas developed earlier, the cropping
pattern improved significantly through the replacement of forage and
annual crops by the more profitable apples and grapes (see Table 1).
The main constraints to irrigation expansion have been the
distance from markets, insufficient marketing facilities, considerable
price fluctuation, the farmers' lcek of capital during the long farm
/1 Instituto de Desarrollo Economico del Valle Inferior

Page 3 of t3 pages
development period, the small numbers of farmers and entrepreneurs and
the insufficiency of government supporting activities. Other constraints
have been lack of farmers' knowledge of irrigation practices and how to
grow specialized crops, insufficient drainage facilities "fiscal" lands
and lands with "unknown" owners (which have not been cultivated), and a
shortage of staff and funds of the government organizations such as "Agua
y Energiall which are responsible for operation and maintenance in most
of the irrigated lands.
Many of these constraints are now being alleviated and a more
rapid development can be expected in the future. The transport situation
has improved considerably end active groups of entrepreneurs are creating
modern processing and marketing facilities in the Upper Valley. The
irrigation and drainage networks have been expanded and improved and
farmers have become more experienced. Most of the marketing and planta-
tion efforts have been limited to the Upper Valley but with suitable
incentives could also be extended to the other areas.
One basic problem for future expansion is to determine whether
the crop pattern used in the Upper Valley should be adopted in the new
areas. There are strong doubts as to the capacity of the foreign market
to absorb a continued and rapid expansion of the apple production. The
EMC market, until now the main outlet for Argentina's apple exports, is
expected to shrink because of heavy plantings and the development of
cold storage.  Even a l rge expansion of the Latin American market would
not allow the present rate of growth of exports to be maintained. This
was recognized by the mission when making crop pattern projections.
The mission estimates that with proper government measures,
the annual rate of irrigation expansion could rise from 2,000 ha to 3,500
ha during the next 15 years (see Table2). Most of this expansion would
take place on the land already canalized in the Middle and Lower Valleys.
Afterwards, using the experience gained, 5000 ha and more could be put
under irrigation each year mainly in the Lower Valley and in a new
"Valle IMledio" project near Choele Choel.
It takes three or four years of alfalfa to build up soil
fertility on newly developed land and thereafter 10 to 12 yea,:s to bring
fruit trees to full bearing; hence production will rise only -Iowly in
the newly developed areas.  The mission expects the crop patt-rn on
new lands to be -about 40% alfalfa, 30% annual crop, 30% fruit trees and
grapes. Part of the fruit will be for processing; hence the value of
production from these lands will be only half the value per ha of the
presently irrigated lands at full development. In the presently irrigated
areas, production is expected to continue to rise by 3% to 4% a year as



ANNEX 5
Page 4 of 8 pages
young planLtions come to bearing and productivity increases; this rate
will lower progressively as new planting decreases.
The development foreseen for the next 25 years would bring
an increase in total output of some 75%. One-third would come from
intensification of presently irrigated area and the rest from newly
irrigated area. This increase in output has been taken into account
nor flood-damage calculations.
(b)  Irrigation Expansion Possible Without and With CCC
The average annual flow of the rivers Limay and Neuquen is
respectively 24 and 10 milliards cubic meters. The ultimate irrigation
potential is therefore immense; with a mobilization of 20 milliards cubic
meters it could reach some two million ha.
At present, without storage, all irrigation development is
dependent on natural flow diverted by one diversion dam and several free
offtakes.  There are a few private pumps.  The main irrigation season is
from December through April with a peak demand in January; the lowest
river discharge is in March, which is the critical month for irrigatipn
supply.  The mission's analysis of historical flow during critical
neriods indicated that natural low season supplies will suffice for an
expansion of lCO,000 ha before they need be supplemented by storage.
However, without storage on the Neuquen, the area irrigated from that
river cannot be increased substantially since shortages are already
experienced in some very low years.
The operation of Chocon for power and its normal draw down
for flood control during February through April will increase irrigation
water supply in the Limay and the Negro considerably during the critical
year, so that 320,000 ha more could be irrigated than at present.  The
Cerros Colorados part of the complex operated as planned at present
would permit a further 200,000 ha to be irrigated.
(c) Irrigation Benefits of the Project
Summ-rizing, the availability of water from natural flow
should permit the expansion of irrigation on 100,000 ha while the CCC
complex operated for power and flood control could permit an increase
of more than 500,000 new ha. If the project were operated specifically
for irrigation, this area could be further increased. Since the next
100,000 ha will take 25 years to developm it is only in 1993 that
storage would be needed if the CCC complex were not built. The most
economical single purpose alternative reservoir which, operated strictly



ANNEX 5
Page 5 of 8 pages
for irrigation, would allow the irrigation of 200,000 ha is Nahuel
Haupi in the Upper Limay. A dam here was designed by Agua y Energia
some years ago and its construction cost is now estimated to be
US$11 million. A further reservoir of the same capacity and with
about the same cost would be required in around year 2011. Therefore,
irrigation benefits of CCC can be considered as equivalent to the
present worth cost of these dams} i.e. $2.1 million discounting at
8% or $3.6 million at 6%. The present worth of these dams is probably well
below the net returns from lands to be irrigated after 1993 (taking into
account the additional investment which would be necessary) and is
theref'ore adopted as the portion of the project cost which can be allo-
cated to irrigation for rate base purposes.
3.   Flood Control Benefits
(a) Flood Damages Without Project
The flood characteristics of the Rivers Limay and Neuquen are
quite distinct. The Limay, having the larger drainage area and a number
of lakes in its catchment has a larger flood volume but a lower flood
peak than Neuquen. Flood peaks from the two rivers frequently reach the
Rio Negro simultaneously. The threshold of damage in the Negro Valley
is recognized as a flood with a peak of 4,~,00 m3/sec; it has been
exceeded nine times during the last 90 years and always during the period
June to August. The highest flood observed was in July 1899 with a peak
between 8,ooo and 9,000 m3/sec; about 80% of the presently cultivated
area was covered by running or still water. In 1945 a flood of 6,s00
m3/sec was observed after more than 1,000 m3/sec had been diverted to
Lake Pellegrini; 10% of the presently cultivated area was inundated.
The escape channel from the Neuquen to Lake Pellegrini became operational
in 1937 and has a nominal capacity of 2,000 m3/sec. It is controlled by
an earth bank which is breached during times of flood. Due to siltation,
its capability has deteriorated to about 1,000 m3/sec.
Average annual flood damages for the present stage of develop-
ment were derived from a combination of two relationships, flood discharge-
frequency and damage-discharge. The former was based upon a statistical
analysis of annual peak discharges in the upper Rio Negro, adjusted for
Lake Pellegrini diversions. The latter relationship was more difficult
to derive; however, the mission calculated that a flood of the 1899
magnitude would now cause $50 million damages in terms of crop losses
and damages to infrastructure and farm lands. A flood of the 1945 mag-
nitude would today cause damages of $3.5 million. From these estimates,



ANNEX 5
Page 6 of 8 pages
a damage/discharge curve was derived little different from the curve
prepared by the consultants, Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners. On these
bases, average annual flood damages at present development were calculated
at $1.4 million.
In the future, damages would increase with the expansion of
irrigated area and the rise in productivity. Based on irrigation pro-
jections for 1973, 1983 and 1993 (see Table 2), the corresponding flood
damages were estimated. The present worth of preventing these damages
after 1973 upon completion of the project discounted at 8% would be
$20 million, or $32 million if discounted at 6%. These figures are lower
than the consultant's estimate since the mission projects a less rapid
development of irrigation.
(b) Effect of CCC and Other Works on Flood Control
Chocon reservoir, with its 2.8 milliards flood control capacity
would, the mission estimates, reduce flood damages by 73% if the Pellegrini
escape channel retains its present capacity of l,000m3/sec. The 8,00003/sec
inlet capacity at Portezuelo Grande would, together with Chocon, complete
the protection of the valley. The mission estimates nevertheless that a
wholly satisfactory degree of flood control (99.7 % of that from the CCC
complex) could be obtained by increasing diversion capacity to Lake Pelle-
grini up to 4,000m3/sec, while eliminating Cerros Colorados. The mission
feels that such a scheme should have been investigated before deciding on
the Portezuelo Grande component which the Government proposes to build
largely on the basis of its flood control effect. The cost of increasing
Pellegrini diversion capacity including a regulating structure would be
less than half of the cost of the Portezuelo Grande diversion works.
(c) Flood Control Benefits
The mission estimates the flood benefits discounted at 8% to be
expected from the various flood control alternatives as follows:

ANNEX 5
Page 7 of 8 pages
Preliminary designs and cost estimates for a single purpose
dam at Chocon with 2.8 milliards capacity only for flood control (the
same capacity as that allocated for flood control in theiproposed Chocon
reservoir, and hence, the same flood control benefits) were prepared for
the mission by the consultant. This dam would cost about $40 million.
In addition, for practically the same degree of f'lood protection (99.7%)
as CCC, it would be necessary to increase the capacity of the Pellegrini
escape to 4,000 cumecs at a cost of $12 million (mission estimate). Hence
the total cost of providing present worth flood control benefits f
$20 million by these single purpose works would be $52 million V. There-
fore, the part of the cost of the CCC which can be allocated to flood
control, for rate base purposes, can be taken as the actualized value of
the damages prevented, $20 million.
4.  Problems raised by Chocon Operations and Development of the Irrigation
Areas
(a) Operation of the Power Plants
When the Chocon power station becomes fully operational as a
peaking plant, its six units will discharge daily pulses of about 2500 m3 per
sec. If Planicie Banderita is built it will have a similar operating
regime. These daily fluctuating discharges may be expected to cause some
bed scour and bank erosion in the rivers below the outlets, particularly
on the Limay. Rapidly changing water levels will necessitate continuous
adjustments to canal head regulators close to the power plants, but the
effects will be attenuated as the pulses pass downstream. Possibly, at
the Dique on Rio Neuquen, where irrigation canals take a total of 55m3/sec,
it might be necessary to arrange for a few hours of pondage.
Hidronor's consultants are commencing an investigation of these
peaking effects and the remedial measures which will need to be taken.
The mission feels that the provision in the consultants' estimate of
$100,000 per year for the five years, 1974 through 1978, f'or additional
maintenance may not suffice for the remedial works and proposes that this
figure be doubled.
(b) Protection of Irrigation Rights
The reglamento setting out Hidronor's rights and obligations
under its concession is under preparation.  This reglamento will oblige
Hidronor to operate Chocon and Cerros Colorados for flood control (rule
curves for reservoir operation are defined) and to meet the needs of' the
downstream users during the construction, filling and operation periods.
j   It cannot be said with certainty that this is the least cost single
purpose alternative but the mission has no basis upon which to propose
a diffe-rz.nt solution.



ANNEX 5
Page 8 of 8 pages
The manner in which these downstream requirements will be
determined is as yet undefined as is also the representation that
interested downstream authorities and users will have in their deter-
mination. This coordinating problem is not confined to the Rio Negro
basin, but is a general one of interprovincial rivers in the country.
The Ministry of the Interior, with the advice of the newly created
National Hydraulic Institute, is presently studying the problem.
In the case of the Rio Negro, Hidronor should be requested to
keep the Bank informed of the arrangements which are made to determine
downstream interests and the manner in which it is intended to meet them.
(c) Promotion of Irrigation Development
The mission was not in a position to determine the benefits to
be expected from alternative investment in the area. It could only
recognize the absolute need for irrigation to develop the valleys of
Northern Patagonia and the impossibility of practicing intensive agri-
culture in this area without irrigation. For establishing their irri-
gation projections, the mission accepted the Government's view that
priority will be given to the development of irrigation in the valleys.
There are a number of steps which should be taken if the pro-
jected increase is to be achieved. A considerable increase in medium
and long-term credit facilities is essential, particularly for the area
to be newly developed. The presently uncertain status of state land and
unknown owners' land must be clarified and these lands put under irrigation.
This would be only part of the necessary incentives to induce entrepreneurs
and processors to take investment risks in new lands. A more efficient
extension organization in the Middle Valley is urgently needed. The ope-
ration and maintenance services need more equipment. The mission suggests
that the Government should consider actively encouraging entrepreneurs and
investors with capital to take up large holdings.
3.   Conclusions
If the Government were to take active measures to encourage
irrigation development in the Rio Negro valley, a storage reservoir would
be needed after 25 years and the irrigation facilities given by the project
discounted at 8% are worth about $2 million.  The project will prevent flood
damages with a present value, also discounted at 8%, of $20 million. The
total cost to be allocated to irrigation and flood controlfor determining
the rate base should be $22 million.

From the extent of the areas flooded in 1899, it is estimated
that with such a flood 80% of the presently irrigated area would have
been damaged by standing or running water. In the newly developed areas,
a smaller percentage of the land will be affected as less land will be
susceptible to flooding in view of its location.
